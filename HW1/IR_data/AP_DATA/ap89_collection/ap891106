<HEAD>Duchess of York Visits Inner-City School in Houston</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York visited an inner-city school
Monday, ending a five-day trip to Texas that included opera, a polo
match and a stop at a private ranch.
   The former Sarah Ferguson took part in an anti-drug program, and
was serenaded by more than 600 students at Blackshear Elementary
School.
   ``She seemed like royalty,'' said fifth-grader Gary Williams, 11.
   The duchess, who is married to Britain's Prince Andrew, came to
Houston Thursday at the invitation of the Houston Grand Opera,
which is saluting 300 years of British opera. She took a flight
Monday afternoon to New York, where she planned to spend a day.
   Royal-watchers who gathered outside the school Monday morning
applauded her, and some shouted, ``We love you Fergie!''
   The duchess participated in the school's Drug Abuse Resistance
Education program, known as DARE, by joining students in an
anti-drug play.
   She also gave the school's library autographed copies of the
``Budgie'' books for children she has written. Students presented
her a book they had written.
   ``We thought she was very fun,'' Gary said. ``We were excited to
see her. She did some sketches with us.''
   The sketches involved students acting out criticism for students
who are pretending to drink, smoke or use drugs.
   During one sketch, the duchess showed her disgust for smoking by
pulling her long red hair across her face.
   ``I think she was really concerned about the program,'' said
Blackshear principal George Mundine. ``She was very impressed.''
   The duchess then went to the school playground where students
holding small U.S. and British flags were standing in a formation
that spelled DARE.
   ``Your Royal Highness, the Duchess of York, from the boys and
girls of Blackshear School, may I present to you these flowers and
ask for your permission to sing?'' shouted 8-year-old Jermaine
Thibodeaux, who gave the duchess a bouquet of yellow roses.
   The students sang ``Deep in the Heart of Texas,'' ``Yankee
Doodle Dandy,'' ``You're a Grand Old Flag,'' ``We are the World,''
and an anti-drug song.
   ``You really were very good, and are very good, and you look so
smart,'' the duchess said.
   She thanked the students for the book, ``The Big Parade,'' and
said her toddler daughter, Beatrice, would love it. The book, which
is about the duchess going to the circus, was written by several
students, Mundine said.
   The duchess is five months pregnant with her second child.
   During her stay in Houston, Sarah was the guest of the family of
Oscar Wyatt, chairman of Coastal Corp. of Houston. His wife, Lynn,
is vice chairman of the Houston Grand Opera.
   She spent Saturday night at the Wyatts' ranch near Hebbronville,
but stayed the rest of the time at their mansion.
   The duchess attended a polo match Sunday, where Great Britain
defeated a Texas team, 11-6. Her father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson,
captained the British team and she stood in the rain to present
trophies to the victors.

<HEAD>Tammy Faye Agrees to Leave Mall Church-Studio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tammy Faye Bakker agreed Monday to vacate
her storefront church by the end of the month after the owner of
the shopping mall threatened to sue to get her evicted.
   ``Mrs. Bakker has agreed that they will be out by Nov. 30, that
there will be no more delays, that there will be no more unforeseen
problems,'' attorney Ed Leinster said after meeting with the wife
of imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker.
   The Bakkers' Orlando ministry, which has been conducting Sunday
church services and occasional television gospel shows out of a
makeshift church-studio for about four months, owed at least
$73,000 in rent, said Shoppers World mall owner Stewart Gilman.
   Gilman had ordered the financially strapped ministry to leave
almost two weeks ago, but Mrs. Bakker and her supporters continued
to hold services there the past two Sundays.
   On Sunday, she told followers that services would continue to be
held there until the ministry found a new, inexpensive site to
lease, preferably for no more than $5 per square foot.
   Gilman contacted Leinster, who is his attorney.
   Mrs. Bakker has vowed to continue the ministry. Her only comment
Monday was, ``We're looking for a place in Orlando.''
   Jim Bakker, 49, was convicted of bilking ``lifetime partners''
of the now-defunct PTL of $3.7 million to support the Bakkers'
lavish lifestyle. He is serving a 45-year sentence at the Federal
Medical Center in Rochester, Minn.
   At the service Sunday, Tammy Bakker said the ministry now faces
a $500 million lawsuit brought by former PTL followers. She urged
worshipers to remain ``faithful in your tithings'' because that's
the only way God can be expected to answer prayers for better jobs,
pay raises or income tax refunds.
   ``That is what God can do for you if you are faithful to him,''
she said.
   She said the Jim and Tammy television gospel show would remain
off the air until the ministry pays off $400,000 in
production-related debt. No new shows have aired since Jim Bakker's
conviction.

   Violinist Itzhak Perlman the soloist, Zubin
Mehta the conductor and Beethoven the composer. For a music lover,
this New York Philharmonic concert at Avery Fisher Hall was about
as good as it gets.
   Perlman began the evening with ``Romance No. 1 for Violin and
Orchestra,'' followed by the somewhat more familiar ``Romance No.
2.'' He played them with a tone of warmth, depth and purity.
   The orchestra was glittering in its performance of the ``Eighth
Symphony.'' Mehta began it at a brisk tempo; the orchestra seemed
to lean into it and, flowing together, they propelled themselves
through the music. The result could be compared favorably with any
favorite recording of the symphony.
   After intermission came ``Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D
Major.'' The orchestra sounded marvelous and Perlman exquisitely
and seamlessly changed tone, from white to full of colors. He
concentrated; one could almost see his mind dictating glissandos
and trills. Had the audience reacted as opera audiences do, there
would have been applause after every solo. During one poignant
passage, the audience seemed too intent to breathe.

   The cast of the movie ``Steel Magnolias'' showed
off their Southern accents and helped raise money for a charity in
the region where the story is based.
   ``It's such a thrill to have this premiere in the South, where
I'm from,'' said screenwriter Robert Harling, on whose hit play the
movie is based. Harling grew up in the small central Georgia town
of Madison.
   Actresses Sally Field, Shirley MacLaine, Julia Roberts and
Olympia Dukakis attended a gala champagne reception, screening and
buffet Monday to benefit the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. Hundreds
turned out, paying $100 to $150 each.
   Cast members attended a benefit premiere Sunday in New York.
They also are scheduled to appear Thursday in Los Angeles and
Friday in Natchitoches, La., where the movie was filmed.
   ``Steel Magnolias'' stars Ms. Roberts as a headstrong, beautiful
young woman who draws strength from the women around her while
battling a serious illness.
   Ms. Roberts, a native of nearby Smyrna, said ``the wonderful
quirkiness of where I'm from'' helped in Southern role.
   Ms. Dukakis, the Oscar-winning daughter of a Greek immigrant,
though, displayed for reporters a more-than-passable Southern
accent: ``Pay-ull mee uh pay-uh'' (``Peel me a pear'').
   And Ms. MacLaine, who has chronicled her spiritual travels in
several best-selling books, explained how she prepared for her role
as a grumbling curmudgeon: ``I just slummed into the future and saw
myself.''

<HEAD>Australian Police Set Up `Granny Squad' To Trap Killer Of Elderly
Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police say they have set up a ``Granny
Squad'' to capture a killer who bludgeons elderly women in wealthy
Sydney suburbs, a psychopath dubbed the ``Society Killer'' by
newspapers.
   Police said Monday that the killer could be a woman. The suspect
is suspected of stalking and killing four women in the past eight
months _ all in their eighties, always in daylight and all on the
classy North Shore.
   The killer taunts police by leaving victims' belongings in parks
and other public places weeks after the crime.
   ``For God's sake, how many more people must die?'' Detective
Sgt. Paul Meagher asked Thursday after two attacks in 24 hours.
   John Avery, police commissioner for New South Wales state,
announced formation of 24-hour granny patrols. Thirty-five
detectives were assigned to guard old people's homes and scan
streets in an area across the Harbor Bridge from downtown that has
Australia's highest concentration of elderly.
   An estimated 50 percent of homes on the North Shore are occupied
by single people.
   Australian media labeled the attacker the Society Killer after
Sydney socialite Lady Winifreda Ashton was battered to death in
May. She was found savagely bashed and throttled, with her
stockings outside her home.
   A month earlier, Gwendoline Mitchelhill, 82, was found outside
her apartment with massive injuries.
   Three other attacks occurred which resulted in two deaths, all
in strikingly similar circumstances.
   The only survivor, Doris Cox, 86, said she was hit from behind
with a piece of wood and described her attacker as young, with
short, dark hair. Police refused to rule out the possiblity the
suspect is a woman.
   The killer has been active from sometime between noon to 6 p.m.,
attacking single elderly women on their arrival home from shopping.
Avery said a police task force was looking for a ``meticulous
psycopath.''
   ``There is a high proportion of the elderly living on the North
Shore and they are terrified,'' said Mayor Ted Mack of Sydney. He
advised elderly women not to leave home unless they are accompanied
by friends or relatives.
   Homicide detectives said the attacker liked ransacking his
victims' purses and leaving personal belongings to be found weeks
later.

<TEXT>
   One of Britain's best known convicted gangsters,
who with his twin brother headed a powerful criminal empire in the
1960s, was married for a second time behind bars, prison
authorities said.
   Gangland killer Ronnie Kray, 56, a diagnosed paranoid
schizophrenic, wedded former kissogram girl Kate Howard, 33, Monday
in a ceremony at Broadmoor hospital for the criminally insane.
   The best man was convicted double killer Charlie Smith.
   Ronnie Kray and his twin brother Reggie built up an underworld
empire based on protection rackets and other criminal activity.
   Posing as respectable businessmen and nightclub owners, they
mixed with high society personalities until they were sentenced to
life imprisonment in 1969 for killing gangland rivals.
   The wedding at Broadmoor, 30 miles west of London, was Ronnie's
second behind bars. He and Elaine Mildener, 29, were married in the
top-security hospital in 1985. The couple divorced after less than
three years.
   The new Mrs. Kray spent 90 minutes with her husband before he
was returned to his cell.
   She told reporters outside the hospital: ``It is a shame Ronnie
can't be here but we are obviously in love and I shall be going to
see him tomorrow.'' She did not say how they came to meet.
   A handful of friends attended the ceremony conducted by the
local registrar and drank non-alcoholic beverages.
   Reggie Kray, who is held in a conventional prison at Lewes 60
miles southeast of London, did not attend the wedding.
   The bride kept her head bowed as she arrived in a gold Rolls
Royce for the ceremony wearing a peach-silk taffeta dress and
carrying a bouquet of carnations, the groom's favorite flowers.

   A robber whose cucumber ``gun'' fooled cashiers
into handing over more than $18,800 has been sentenced to seven
years in prison.
   Ernest Coveley, 37, wrapped the vegetable in a plastic bag and
waved it like a sawed-off shotgun at cashiers in mortgage lending
institutions known as building societies, a court was told. On two
occasions, when he was unable to afford the price of a cucumber, he
used an iron bar.
   Defense lawyer Stephen Pownall said Coveley used a cucumber
because it was the most innocuous thing he could think of.
   But Circuit Judge Edwin, who sentenced Coveley on Monday, told
the defendant he had frightened his victims.
   ``They were put in great fear, not to say terror by you,'' the
judge said.
   ``I have no doubt you used the cucumber so that if you were
caught later in the street you would be able to point to the
vegetable and deny any responsibility for what you had done.''
   Coveley pleaded guilty last month to eight robberies in east and
northeast London between May and July, saying he used the money to
buy drugs.

   The most dangerous women in the ancient world
spent a fortune on perfume, and the vanity of at least one Biblical
king can be measured by the size of his bathtub.
   The lavishness of the ancients' royal boudoir and bath will be
on display starting Nov. 14 in an Israel Museum exhibition of a
1,000-piece collection of toiletries from ancient Israel.
   Blown-glass eyeliner kits, jewel-studded makeup palettes,
polished bronze mirrors, gold hairpins, faience cosmetic boxes.
   Among the collection is an ivory cosmetic spoon that once held
the eyeshadow of Queen Jezebel, the 9th century B.C. ruler who gave
makeup a bad name. There is also the only surviving juglet of
balsam, the favorite scent of the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra.
   ``Cosmetics in antiquity appealed at first to both men and
women. Over the centuries, cosmetics became more used by women,''
said Michal Dayagi-Mendes, curator of Biblical archaeology and
organizer of the exhibit.
   She said cosmetics were used as a means to color the faces of
gods to make them appear less cold and remote. Soon, priestly
attendants adopted the colorings and ultimately so did ordinary
people.
   In the hot, dry climate of the Middle East, cosmetics also
served a medicinal purpose.
   ``Wearing makeup repelled the little flies that caused
inflamation of the eyes. Also, eyeshadow took the place of
sunglasses, reducing the glare,'' she said.
   Like their modern counterparts, ancients squandered vast sums on
pampering themselves, indulging in cosmetic fads that sometimes
were silly and harmful.
   Ancient Egyptians used a reddish ochre makeup over the entire
face. Romans lightened their faces with a powder made from
crocodile excrement. Greek women used a finely ground lead to turn
their faces white and spent hours in the sun to bleach their hair.
   ``The Greeks were aware that the lead caused great damage, but
beauty was above everything else,'' Dayagi-Mendes said.
   Roman women went to great extremes to braid and curl their hair
and many wore wigs.
   But the greasy look was in, mainly because oil was used to
combat lice. The pests and more than 80 lice eggs were found, for
example, on a 2,000-year-old wooden comb recovered recently from
the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea.
   Nero's wife, Pompaea, was especially extravagant.
   ``Every day she took a bath in asses' milk. When she was finally
banished from Rome, she was allowed to take 50 asses with her just
to make sure she could have her daily milk bath,'' said
Dayagi-Mendes.
   Her bath did not survive, but that of Herod the Great was
retrieved a few years ago from his ruined Kypros winter palace near
Jericho. The 1{-ton, six-foot-long alabaster bathtub is a monument
to the grandiose style of one of the ancient world's great builders
and architect of the Second Jewish Temple.
   ``The man obviously had good taste and enjoyed all the
luxuries,'' she said, pointing to the regal tray where oils and
lotions once rested on the side of the tub.
   The costliest luxury in the ancient world, however, was perfume,
and ancient Israelites made the most famous variety, balsam, from a
now-extinct tree that once grew on the edges of the Dead Sea.
   To please Cleopatra, the Roman general Anthony acquired a whole
orchard of the precious balsam trees near Jericho so she would
always have a supply of her favorite fragrance, which cost twice as
much as silver.
   Calling it ``serpent's poison,'' sages of the Jewish Talmud
recount that the daughters of Jerusalem put balsam in their shoes
and, on seeing attractive young men, clicked their heels to release
the fragrance as a lure.
   Today, the only surviving balsam is a 1{-ounce flask covered in
palm matting that has lost all its allure. Only a musty, oily scent
remains in the padded box where it is kept.
   ``It must have been sweet, heavy and oily. It was their taste,
but you can't say more,'' said Dayagi-Mendes.
   To give museum goers a whiff of the past, Dayagi-Mendes has
enlisted the help of experts in Holland and Israel to recreate a
fragrance similar to the ones in Biblical times.
   ``I used all the plants mentioned in the Bible in connection
with perfumes and scented ointments,'' she said, adding that
ingredients included cinnamon, myrrh and frankincense.
   The result is Avishag, a perfume named after a consort of King
David. A two-ounce bottle is being marketed at the exhibition for
$50.
   ``We thought it would be intriguing to smell something of
antiquity, and this way you can take something home to remember
besides a brochure,'' she said.

   Amanda Blake, who played Miss Kitty in
the long-running ``Gunsmoke'' television series, died of
AIDS-related complications, not cancer as previously reported, her
doctor said Monday.
   Blake did have throat cancer, but ``that wasn't the reason that
she died,'' said Dr. Lou Nishimura, a Sacramento internist.
   After Blake died Aug. 16 at Mercy General Hospital in
Sacramento, a statement composed by the hospital and the actress'
friends reported her death as the result of her long battle with
cancer.
   Blake, 60, had AIDS symptoms for about a year, said Nishimura.
He said he didn't know how she contracted the fatal disease.
   Blake's fifth husband, Mark Spaeth, an Austin, Texas, city
councilman and developer, died of pneumonia in 1985 at age 45. They
married in April 1984, and divorced a short time later.
   Blake's death certificate listed the immediate cause of death as
cardiopulmonary arrest due to liver failure and CMV hepatitis. CMV
or cytomegalo virus hepatitis is AIDS-related, said Nishimura, who
treated Blake during the year before her death and signed her death
certificate.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer were listed on
the certificate as contributing to her death.
   Nishimura was interviewed following a report Friday on
Sacramento television station KRBK quoting friends of Blake who
said AIDS had played a role in her death.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that attacks the body's immune system.
It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
pregnant women to their offspring.
   Once a two-pack-a-day smoker, Blake had undergone surgery for
oral cancer in 1977 and afterward made appearances throughout the
country on behalf of the American Cancer Society.
   Jerri Ewen, a Mercy General spokeswoman, said she reported
cancer as the cause of death at the request of Blake's close
friends. ``When somebody dies, you go by what the wishes of the
family are. In this case, the friends were the family,'' Ewen said.
   Ewen said she never saw the death certificate.
   Death certificates are public documents under California law and
are recorded with the county where a person dies.
   Ewen said the hospital reported the death to the federal Centers
for Disease Control.
   Blake reigned as Miss Kitty, queen of Dodge City's Long Branch
Saloon, for 19 years in the TV series ``Gunsmoke.'' Set in the
lawless cattle town of Dodge City, Kan., in the late 1800s,
``Gunsmoke'' was one of television's original ``adult westerns'' in
the mid-1950s.
   Blake left ``Gunsmoke'' in 1974. The show last one more season
on CBS, then was canceled.
   After ``Gunsmoke,'' she worked only sporadically, usually in
guest appearances for TV game shows, movies of the week and such
series as ``Edge of Night,'' ``Hart to Hart,'' and ``Love Boat.''
   Miss Blake, a resident of Sacramento, was a longtime activist
for animal protection.

   Mementos of white bigotry from
yesteryear _ Little Black Sambo dolls, ``Colored Only'' signs,
figurines of grinning, watermelon-eating urchins _ are becoming hot
collectors' items among American blacks who once scorned them as
hated symbols of humiliation.
   The booming market for ``black collectibles'' has attracted such
celebrities as Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg and
heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, who reportedly collects
African slave chains and shackles.
   ``Black people buy these items for the very same reason that
Jewish people research the Holocaust,'' says Jeanette B. Carson, a
prominent figure in the black memorabilia business. ``The black
experience, during and after slavery, was a Holocaust we must never
forget.''
   Ms. Carson, 56, a retired State Department specialist in African
affairs, began collecting black artifacts about seven years ago.
The 600 items that fill her home near Washington, D.C., range from
quilted dolls hand-sewn by former slaves to a mirrored mahogany hat
rack, valued at $800 to $900, which prize fighter Joe Louis once
kept in his dressing room.
   Ms. Carson's home-based firm, Ethnic Treasures Inc., sponsors
dealer shows and auctions from New York to Atlanta. She also
publishes ``Black Ethnic Collectibles,'' a bimonthly magazine with
8,000 subscribers, and heads the National Association of Black
Memorabilia Collectors, with more than 500 members nationwide.
   Ms. Carson says the business has grown from about 50 dealers in
1983 to more than 500 this year, with an estimated $500,000 in
annual sales. The number of collectors _ like dealers, once mostly
white but now predominantly black _ has soared from about 10,000 to
more than 35,000 in the past six years, she says.
   Her personal collection includes 100 hand-fashioned dolls and
other objects presenting a positive image of blacks, including
commemorative stamps and coins, historical photographs and
newspapers, and record albums, paintings and sculptures by black
artists.
   No less valuable, she says, are the racist artifacts that older
black customers find highly offensive. Like souvenir placemats from
a 1940s chain of restaurants in the Western states called ``Coon
Chicken Inns,'' whose logo was a winking, smiling black face. Or
the framed sign reading ``Colored Seated in Rear,'' dating from
1929. Or the original 1897 sheet music for a Negro dialect song
titled ``Ma Curly-Heady Babby.''
   Or the yellowed postcards with cartoons of wide-eyed, pigtailed
black children _ they were called ``pickaninnies'' in those days _
engaged in such pursuits as riding mules, picking cotton, sitting
on a toilet seat or tugging at the tails of Florida alligators.
   ``They all tell a story,'' says Ms. Carson. ``They are important
because they document our history, both the positive and the
negative. It is particularly important to pass them along to young
people, so they know where they came from and where they are
going.''
   Ms. Carson said there was a time when older blacks, including
her parents, destroyed Aunt Jemima cookie jars and Amos 'n' Andy
toys as painful reminders of racial stereotypes created for the
amusement of whites.
   But Ms. Carson said popular interest in collecting and
preserving black memorabilia has increased with the rise of a
younger generation which is proud of its racial heritage.
   ``This is one aspect of bringing our history and culture to
light,'' she said. ``If our children continue to be misinformed by
history books which focus on what happened in white America, they
won't feel they belong to this society or have any idea of the
important contributions their ancestors made to this country.''

600 slabs and chunks of stone recalling famous people through the
centuries.
   There's a stone from the cathedral crypt in Havana that once
held the remains of Christopher Columbus. There's a slab of worn
flagstone from the east portico of George Washington's home at
Mount Vernon, Va. There's a bit of stone from Atlanta donated by
the family of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King.
   Honored are half the signers of the Declaration of Independence,
most of the American presidents, flagmaker Betsy Ross, composer
Richard Wagner, Aristotle, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
   Most of the rocky memorabilia were collected by Hamilton Holt,
president of the the small private college from 1925 to 1949.
   Holt, a wealthy New Englander who was active in the world peace
movement that led to the formation of the United Nations, had
friends around the world who helped with his hobby.
   Adm. Richard Byrd brought a souvenir from the mountains of the
South Pole and presented it to the campus himself in 1938.
President Harry Truman joined Holt for a stone-laying ceremony in
his honor on March 8, 1949, after receiving an honorary degree.
   ``The stones ... are of no intrinsic value,'' Holt once wrote,
``yet each one of them is eloquent with suggestion and
inspiration.''
   Each of the geological souvenirs has been carefully set in a
slab of concrete engraved with the name of the person it represents
and the place where it originated.
   For years the stones were part of an asphalt pathway and were
actually walked on, defaced and weathered. But they have recently
been cleaned and restored and set off from the walkway itself by
concrete borders.
   The landscaped Walk of Fame was rededicated on its 60th
anniversary this past weekend.
   Not everyone proposed for the walk has actually been honored.
   In 1945, someone donated a stone from the fireplace of Adolf
Hitler's bunker in Berlin. Holt accepted, planning to use it in a
``walk of ill fame.''
   But either Holt or a successor thought the better of the plan,
and the Hitler relic has been lost.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: State Department Should Speak Up, Members of Congress
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Throughout his 1988 campaign for the
presidency, George Bush complained of excessive interference by
Congress in the day-to-day running of U.S. foreign policy.
   Echoing President Reagan, Bush maintained it is impossible to
conduct any kind of sensible and coherent foreign policy ``with 535
secretaries of state'' insisting that their views prevail.
   As president, Bush also has had occasion to complain of
congressional ``micromanagement,'' as he did when Congress imposed
restrictions on the transfer of U.S. aircraft technology to Japan.
   But for the moment, at least, the complaints are going the other
way.
   Senators are complaining that when they do seek policy direction
and advice from the State Department, department representatives
often are either silent or nowhere to be found, leaving lawmakers
to thrash matters out as best they can.
   The problem, they say, is not one of 535 secretaries of state;
it is the difficulty of obtaining the views of representatives of
the only official Secretary of State, James A. Baker III.
   At a recent hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
the issue under discussion was a law enforcement treaty drafted as
a weapon in the war on drugs.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., offered four modifications or
``understandings.''
   What did the State Department think about changes in
interpretation of the treaty its diplomats had negotiated?
   No State Department official was present to respond. Whereupon
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., erupted.
   ``The State Department is systematically yielding its position
in foreign relations,'' he said. ``I do not know what they think
they are doing.''
   ``They have let the Central Intelligence Agency take over the
estimates of world situations and take over most of their embassies.
   ``And on things like these treaties, they will not even show up.
...
   ``They are becoming a caricature,'' Moynihan said. ``... It is
as if they had finally decided to agree with the people who despise
them.
   ``They are afraid to come here and say they are not in favor of
these understandings,'' the senator said. ``They are fearful of
having to do so. If they are fearful, why don't they get a job
where you don't have to take a position on anything? Or maybe that
is what they think the State Department job is.''
   Finally, a member of the staff of the State Department's legal
office arrived to say that the department did indeed object to the
understandings, but not enough to delay action on the treaties
themselves.
   So the understandings, and the treaty, were approved.
   But the complaints continued.
   On the Senate floor, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., was outvoted in
a bid to waive the requirement that no appropriations for the State
Department be approved until Congress passes an authorization bill.
   His motive: This year's authorization is bogged down in a
difficult conference between the Senate and House foreign affairs
committees.
   Rudman contended the department is known to vigorously object to
major portions of the authorization bills.
   His side would have prevailed _ and funding for the State
Department would have been assured _ if the department had had the
courage to speak out, Rudman said.
   ``My understanding is that the department was unwilling to go on
record because they were fearful of offending the authorizing
committees,'' Rudman said. ``I hope the department will have more
courage in the conduct of its other affairs than it does in this
one.
   ``They were not willing to stand up and be counted,'' Rudman
said and added:
   ``I will give the State Department a message here on the floor
of the U.S. Senate. I have stood up and been counted for that
department in the last nine years.
   ``I shall not do so again.''

<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An engineering professor who penned a
history of the pencil says that while the topic hasn't gotten much
ink, it is anything but pointless.
   Drawing on two years of research, Duke University Professor
Henry Petroski has written a 450-page book on the pencil that
includes the following:
   _ You could probably draw a line 70 miles long with one pencil;
   _ It would probably cost $50 for a person to make a 10-cent
pencil;
   _ There are 2 billion pencils produced in the United States
annually;
   _ The so-called lead in a pencil is actually graphite and clay.
The more clay the harder the point.
   _ Erasers didn't appear on pencils until about 100 years ago.
``There was a great debate about whether children in schools should
be given pencils with erasers,'' Petroski said. ``People said if
they had erasers, they would be encouraged to make mistakes.''
   What he doesn't know is when the first pencil as we know it
today was produced.
   ``People don't record the origins of such common things,''
Petroski said.
   He does know that the first illustration of a pencil appeared in
1565, the date generally noted as its origin.
   Petroski's book, ``The Pencil: A History of Design and
Circumstance,'' is being released in January.
   Petroski intended to write about the cultural role of
engineering. The pencil was merely to serve as an introduction to
some of his thoughts on engineering.
   ``I couldn't find much written on the pencil and soon realized
there was no definitive history of it,'' Petroski said.
   That led Petroski to do his own.
   Petroski thinks the pencil will continue to make its mark. It
has withstood the invention of the typewriter, the ball-point pen,
the printing press and the computer.
   ``There's no reason it's ever going to disappear,'' he said.
``It's held up as a model of design.''

<HEAD>Poland Almost Self-Sufficient in Food Supply, Agriculture Department
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new analysis by the Agriculture Department
says Poland is close to providing enough food for itself and that
aid from the United States and other countries may be needed for
only a brief period.
   ``Despite the much-publicized long food lines and empty food
shelves in Polish shops, Poles are not starving,'' the report said.
``Annual per capita meat consumption, at 63 kilograms (about 139
pounds) in 1988, is approximately the same as in Norway, Spain,
Sweden and the United Kingdom.''
   It added: ``Total caloric intake, nearly 3,300 calories a day
(per capita), is close to that of western Europe, but markedly
below that in the U.S. (3,500). The country is close to becoming
self-sufficient in food, and may face only a short-term need for
food assistance.''
   The latest U.S. food aid for Poland was formally signed on
Friday, providing up to 10,000 metric tons of pork bellies. The
meat is part of a $100 million package of U.S. food aid pledged by
President Bush this fiscal year.
   Ambassador Jan Kinast of Poland said the $10 million worth of
pork ``helps us to meet our immediate needs'' and that his country
has many complex reforms underway that are aimed at boosting farm
output.
   If there is additional U.S. aid in Poland's future, Kinast said
he hoped it would include ``such products which would help us
stimulate the agricultural production'' of his country.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa put it more bluntly a day earlier
in Gdansk when he expressed thanks for the first emergency shipment
of U.S. grain. ``I am not delighted with this kind of help,'' he
said. ``I treat this help as a kind of necessity, so we can work
out solutions.''
   Walesa said it would be better if Americans would send combines
and other machines to help farmers produce more in Poland.
   The USDA report by economists Nancy J. Cochrane and Francis
Urban in Agricultural Outlook magazine said many reforms have been
instituted by the Polish government _ the first non-communist
leadership in the Eastern Bloc _ but that ``long-term solution to
Poland's food problems will require drastic improvements in farm
efficiency and cost control.''
   Basic policy changes that have been suggested include a more
determined drive to consolidate Poland's fragmented private farms.
   Almost 70 percent of Poland's agricultural land is in private
farms. The maximum holding is 100 hectares (247 acres), but the
average is only five hectares (less than 12.5 acres), the report
said.
   These farms account for about 80 percent of Poland's gross
agricultural output, with the remainder coming from some 4,500
state farms of about 1,000 hectares (2,470 acres) each.
   ``Many of the private farms are fragmented into several small
plots, and all are under-capitalized,'' the report said. ``Many are
operated by older people, as younger workers leave for city jobs.''
   The state farms are less efficient and require large subsidies.
Also, under the old central planning system, state farmers got top
priority for the distribution of ``inputs'' such as fertilizer,
seed and machinery, the report said.
   Polish agricultural output ``has improved dramatically'' since
the sharp declines after martial law was imposed in the early
1980s, especially in grain production. But livestock output _ the
meat, poultry and dairy products needed for consumers _ has slumped
since it rebounded in the mid-1980s.
   ``Red meat production for 1989 is likely to slip by 6 percent,''
the report said. ``The sector suffers from poor profitability and
perennially tight feed supplies.''
   Farm output continues to be hampered by shortages of production
supplies, inadequate storage and transportation facilities.
Fertilizer use dropped in 1989 for the third consecutive year,
reflecting shortages and high prices. There are shortages of small
machinery and spare parts.
   ``Moreover, while Poland has an excellent network of
agricultural research institutes, there is no effective extension
service that can transmit the results of this research to the
farmers,'' the report said.

<HEAD>CIA Says Average Soviet Earned $8,850 in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA says the average Soviet citizen earned
the equivalent of $8,850 last year, less than half the average
American's earnings of $19,970.
   The Central Intelligence Agency's ``Handbook of Economic
Statistics 1989'' shows the U.S. figure was higher than that of
other major non-communist countries, with the average Japanese
shown as earning $14,340 and the average West German $14,260.
   Earnings of the average American grew by 2.9 percent in 1988;
the average Soviet citizen enjoyed an increase of only 0.5 percent.
   The handbook's 1988 edition did not include a figure for the
Soviet Union, though other statistics indicate the average
citizen's earnings there was $8,363 in 1987, compared with $18,200
for the average American.
   The CIA makes these comparisons on a ``purchasing power'' basis.
That means it does not translate foreign earnings into dollars at
prevailing exchange rates, but at theoretical rates that would
equalize the cost of a basket of goods and services in the two
countries being compared. The document did not say what those
theoretical rates were.
   A few other comparisons were given for 1988: life expectancy was
69 years for the Soviet Union, 75 years for the United States and
78 years for Japan. The average American used up energy equal to
burning 56 barrels of oil, while the average Soviet consumed only
35 barrels worth.
   There were a few more cars than one for every two Americans _
572 per thousand _ and only one for every 24 Soviets _ 42 per
thousand, according to the CIA. The Soviet figure came from 1986
and may have grown some by 1988.
   Soviet international trade was closer to balance than America's:
the United States imported $128 billion worth of goods more than it
exported, while the Soviets had a surplus equal to $3.4 billion.
   Total production of goods and services in the Soviet Union was
valued at $2.5 trillion, compared with $4.9 trillion for the United
States. The Soviet population was larger at mid-year, 296.4 million
compared with 246 million for the United States. Both populations
were growing at the same rate: 0.9 percent a year.
   For 1987, U.S. loans and grants to the Third World were given as
$9.3 billion, and Soviet economic aid as $2.2 billion, rising to
$7.3 billion in 1988. No comparable 1988 figure was given for the
United States.
   The CIA reported some east European countries as turning in a
better earnings record than the Soviets. For the first time in
1988, Czechoslovakia joined 29 other countries where the average
citizen earns the equivalent of more than $10,000 annually, the
only country to join that group last year. The figure for
Czechoslovakia was $10,140. East Germany was already a member, with
average earnings of $12,480 last year.
   At the bottom of the CIA's table were 45 countries from
Afghanistan to Zaire where average earnings were $401 a year or
less _ most of them under a dollar a day.

<TEXT>
   Pinball played in brightly lit, smoke-filled
parlors where millions of Japanese escape stress and engage in
low-stakes gambling has long rivaled baseball as Japan's national
pastime.
   The game of ``pachinko'' and its often gaudy parlors also are at
the center of political scandal following allegations the industry
sought to protect its earnings by paying off legislators.
   After two days of special discussions on the issue in Parliament
last week, however, politicians now seem ready to let the issue
fade. Both opposition and governing party legislators have
acknowledged receiving donations from the industry, but deny any
wrongdoing.
   The industry has about 15,000 parlors nationwide and total
annual revenues estimated at up to $140 billion. About 10 million
Japanese are believed to play pachinko regularly.
   Players ``rent'' 25 small steel balls for 70 cents and try to
shoot the balls through a maze of pegs into winning holes _ often
decorated as flowers or airplanes _ before the balls fall to the
bottom of the upright machine.
   Each success, heralded by bells and flashing lights, brings a
payoff of 15 or so more balls. An automatic firing mechanism is
manipulated to control the velocity of each shot.
   The clanging of balls, ringing bells and loud march music drown
out most other sounds in the parlors and seem to hypnotize pachinko
players, who sit shoulder to shoulder in crowded rows.
   The balls are later counted and exchanged for prizes such as
cigarette lighters that can be turned in for cash at booths near
the parlors. A good day's play would bring in more than $70.
   Because all transactions are in cash, making it virtually
impossible to trace a parlor's income, the game has created a tax
collectors' nightmare.
   ``It's inevitable that our industry is a big tax evader,'' said
the manager of one Tokyo pachinko parlor on condition of anonymity.
``It's all done in cash, and if someone wanted to cheat I'm sure
they could.''
   Police believe organized crime runs parlors or extorts
protection money from them.
   Tax officials long have sought tighter regulations. One idea
proposed by the National Police Agency was the introduction of
pre-paid cards to replace the cash and make tracking pachinko funds
easier.
   The weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun has charged that lawmakers
from Japan's leading opposition party, the Socialists, took bribes
to oppose introduction of the cards.
   Bunshun also alleged huge sums of money from pachinko ended up
in the hands of North Korea's Communist government, with whom the
Socialists have close relations but Japan has no diplomatic ties.
   It also charged North Korea was using pachinko money to bribe
Japanese politicians and illegally influence government policy.
   Many pachinko parlors are owned by Koreans living in Japan,
about 30 percent of whom are loyal to North Korea.
   Although many were born and grew up in this country, most of
Japan's 677,000-member Korean community do not have Japanese
citizenship, and receiving political donations from foreigners or
foreign organizations violates the Political Fund Control Law.
   Kim Kuk Han, a spokesman for the General Association of Korean
Residents in Japan, said his pro-North Korea organization has made
no political donations, through the pachinko industry or otherwise,
to Japanese legislators.
   But the ``pachinko scandal'' has become the latest of several
sex and money scandals that have plagued Japanese politics over the
past year.
   The Socialists have acknowledged that party members received
$56,000 in donations. The governing Liberal Democrats said Thursday
that their party and 52 of its members have received $822,000 in
donations from the industry.
   However, both parties have denied wrongdoing and the issue, the
subject of two days of special hearings, is not expected to be
seriously investigated in future Parliament meetings.

<HEAD>Bush Says He'll Keep Quayle on 1992 Ticket</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle says he's happy that
President Bush is keeping him on the 1992 ticket, but says it's too
early to talk of having any presidential ambitions of his own.
   Bush, in an interview published Sunday by the Dallas Morning
News, said Quayle ``absolutely'' will be his running mate again.
His comment appeared to be an offhanded way of acknowledging his
own hat will be in the ring for a second term _ something the
first-year president has not said publicly before.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, asked Sunday if Bush had
meant to end any suspense about his own intentions, said, ``I think
they've been thinking in terms of an eight-year team all along. I
hope that's not a surprise to anybody.''
   Sununu, speaking with reporters on the tarmac at Westchester
County Airport in White Plains, N.Y., added with a laugh, ``I need
the job.''
   Quayle, appearing on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press,''
said, ``I am very pleased that the president is pleased with the
job that I am doing.'' Asked whether he had thought about running
for president himself, he said, ``What has crossed my mind is just
doing a good job right now.''
   Bush visited his mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, at her home in
Greenwich, Conn., on Sunday after participating in a convocation at
his prep school, Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.
   Mrs. Bush, 88, hospitalized for a week in September with
pneumonia, was well enough to take part in a presidential photo
opportunity outside her front door before her son departed.
   ``I want you to see how well my Ma looked,'' Bush told reporters
as he and older brother Prescott Jr. helped her outside.
   At Andover, the Class of '42 graduate told the crowd of 2,500
assembled on the school's Great Lawn, ``I loved those years. They
did indeed teach `the great end and real business of living''' _ a
phrase from the constitution of the school founded in 1778.
   ``Even now its lessons of honesty, selflessness, faith in God
... enrich every day of our lives,'' said Bush.
   In Bush's day there were no girls and only two black or Hispanic
students at Phillips, also called Andover. Today girls comprise
almost half the 1,217 students, and there are 156 black or Latin
students.
   The convocation marked the 200th anniversary of the visit of
another president, George Washington, two of whose grandnephews
later enrolled in the young, rigorous academy. They proved no match
for the curriculum or the New England weather and had to withdraw.
   The school also draws pupils from dozens of foreign lands, and
it paraded its diversity with a procession of flag-bearing
students, as well as Bible readings in several languages.
   Bush, a star athlete and student leader who went directly from
Andover to become a Navy combat pilot in World War II, said he was
taught that ``we were put on earth to help others.
   ``Back in the early '40s, this formed the essence and character
of Phillips Academy, and you can still feel its power today,'' he
said.
   Bush made the nostalgic visit without his wife, Barbara, who
returned to the White House directly from Camp David because of a
stomach ailment.

<TEXT>
   An imitation rice wine produced at a factory in
the southern China province of Guangdong has poisoned scores of
people, killing 21 and sending at least 136 others to hospitals,
reports said today.
   The poisoning occurred over the past week in Zhaoqing city,
about 125 miles west of the British colony of Hong Kong.
   Four people have been arrested in connection with production of
the imitation wine, which had a level of methyl alcohol far above
standards set by the government, according to reports appearing in
the pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao newspaper.
   Wen Wei Po, another pro-Beijing newspaper that gave the latest
casualty figures, said quick removal of the product from store
shelves was difficult in part because some greedy entrepreneurs
continued to sell the wine despite a mass media campaign warning
people of the deadly liquor.
   The official China News Service reported that officials from one
city district searched more than 60 businesses Saturday and
confiscated more than 545 gallons of the poison alcohol.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is warmly welcoming the
election of Rene Mouawad as president of Lebanon and urging all
Lebanese to back their new leader's efforts to end the 14-year
civil war.
   The State Department on Sunday also issued a congratulatory
statement that singled out for criticism Christian army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun, who had tried to block the session of the
Lebanese parliament that elected Mouawad.
   ``We call upon Gen. Aoun and the Armed Forces to respect the
results of parliament's action,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Nancy Beck.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``welcomes the
election of Rene Mouawad ... The president also commends Lebanon's
parliament for its ratification of the national reconciliation
charter.''
   ``We extend to President Mouawad our sincere congratulations and
best wishes,'' the State Department said.
   ``We ask all parties to refrain from violence and intimidation
and aid President Mouawad in reunifying Lebanon,'' its statement
added.
   To elect Mouawad, parliament met beyond the range of Aoun's
artillery at Kleiat, in Syrian-policed north Lebanon. The
parliament also ratified a peace plan brokered by the Arab League
last month in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   The State Department statement said: ``General Aoun, with his
confrontational tactics and threats of partition, does a disservice
to the state and people he claims to defend.''

<NOTE>Scowcroft Says West Germany Can Cope With Refugee Influx</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House national security adviser says
he believes West Germany can cope with the thousands of East German
refugees crossing its border, but concedes the situation may be
explosive.
   ``West Germany can handle it,'' Brent Scowcroft said Sunday on
the CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation.'' But he added, ``We're
making plans for whatever might happen.
   ``It would be easy ... for something to happen, something
unexpected which could turn what is still, even despite a million
people, a relatively orderly process into chaos or an explosion,''
Scowcroft said.
   The separation of Germany into two parts since World War II has
been a recurrent source of East-West tension.
   The democratic reforms sweeping the Soviet bloc have rekindled
the ``German question'' because, said Scowcroft, ``there is no East
German nation. They distinguish themselves only by their political
and economic system so that to the extent that they reform, they
undercut their reason for existence.''
   Scowcroft predicted that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
in his planned Dec. 2-3 summit with President Bush, will not ask
the West for massive credits for Poland and Hungary as they move

   ``I don't think his intention is to throw Eastern Europe to the

<NOTE>Government Cheats Itself Out of Millions, Says GAO Water Report</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has cheated itself out of
millions of dollars by misinterpreting legislation that specifies
who uses federally subsidized water, says a General Accounting
Office report released today.
   The congressman who wrote the law blames the Interior Department
and the GAO advises Congress to close loopholes that let Interior
interpret the law the way it does.
   The law was written for states where water is scarce, primarily
the West. California farmers have been the greatest beneficiaries
of the loopholes.
   ``Wealthy farmers in California's Central Valley have subverted
the intent of federal water laws, and top Interior Department
officials aware of the abuse declined to take corrective action,''
said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
   Miller said he rewrote the law in 1982 governing the cost of
federal water to Western farmers so that large farms would receive
a limited amount of cheap, federally subsidized water.
   Only farms of 960 acres or less would be eligible.
   But owners of large farms got around the law by reorganizing
into 960-acre tracts that qualified for the subsidies.
   ``Congressional expectations have not been met,'' said the GAO,
which is Congress' investigative arm.
   The Interior Department, however, said it is following
congressional intent, although spokesman Joe Hunter of the
department's Bureau of Reclamation said he had not seen the GAO
report and did not want to comment on specifics in it.

<HEAD>Dollar, Shares Down in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined moderately against the Japanese
yen today, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged down.
   The dollar closed at 143.45 yen, down 0.30 yen from Thursday's
close of 143.75 yen. After opening at 143.25 yen, the currency
moved in a range of 143.22-143.57 yen. It closed at 143.30 yen in
New York on Friday.
   Currency dealers said the yen's strength in Tokyo is a
carry-over from the currency's bullishness in New York on Friday.
   But ``because of a lack of market-affecting incentives, the
yen-dollar rate is stuck slightly above the 143-yen mark today,''
said a dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Another dealer at the Bank of Tokyo said it was ``slow day for
most currency dealers all day today. It is as if the market has not
been fully awakened from the laziness of the long weekend.''
   Financial markets were closed in Japan on Friday due to a
national holiday.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank, said the dollar
stayed at nearly the same level as its close in New York on Friday.
   ``Dealers are taking a wait-and-see attitude with the bidding on
U.S. treasury bills coming up this week,'' he said.
   Bidding for 2-year treasury bonds will begin in New York on
Tuesday. Bidding on 10- and 30-year bonds will start later in the
week.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 69.7-point loser Thursday, lost another 60.86 points, or
0.19 percent, to close at 35,434.00.
   Securities dealers said trading was light and rather
directionless throughout the day.
   After opening slightly lower than Thursday's close, the Nikkei
index rose marginally in early afternoon trading.
   But the most widely followed barometer in the exchange edged
down toward its close in ``directionless and mixed'' trading, said
Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer at Nikko Securities Co.
   He added that investors sidelined themselves because of
uncertainties in the currency market.

   A chili cookoff co-sponsored by an
antacid maker attracted entries from as far away as Iowa and
Hawaii, but it was a Texan's ``Yahoo Chili'' that drove the judges
wild.
   Barbara Benton of Dallas beat 204 other entrants Saturday in the
23rd Annual Terlingua International Chili Cookoff in this Mexican
border town.
   ``Like my grandson says, `It's just awesome,''' Ms. Benton said
after being handed the prize, a 50-pound trophy shaped like a chili
pepper.
   The saucy beef and bean concoctions were judged on taste and
texture by members of the Chili Appreciation Society International,
said Ravi Dasari, spokesman for the group based in San Antonio. The
Texas event was open to winners of regional contests.
   A co-sponsor of the event the past four years, Gaviscon antacid,

   Forbes magazine called Vermont a ``Third
World state that needs all the help it can get.'' Now, the state
Personnel Department is trying to capitalize on the statement.
   ``Forbes was right, and we're ready to admit it,'' the
department said in an advertisement in Sunday's Burlington Free
Press.
   ``Vermont state government always needs capable, creative
committed people willing to work hard for a below-average salary,
but an above-average sense of accomplishment and contribution,''
the ad reads.
   State recruitment supervisor Joe Benner hoped to one-up
publisher Malcolm Forbes by placing the ad in the next issue of
``the capitalist tool.'' Benner figured that it would be good
publicity for the state _ but he didn't figure on the cost of an ad
in Forbes.
   ``We called Forbes and found out it costs $28,000 for one
full-page black-and-white ad, for just one issue,'' Benner said.
``That's more than our advertising budget for the whole year.''
   Instead, the state paid $281.28 for the newspaper ad.

   Tad Tuleja may have attended too many
academic parties where names dropped like a shower of Perrier. Or
maybe it was the plethora of publications he dug through as a
student of literature.
   Whatever it was, Tuleja, by day a writing instructor at the
University of Massachusetts School of Management, now spends much
of his time engaged in what he calls ``mockademia,'' books that
poke fun at scholarly research.
   His latest work, ``The Catalog of Lost Books,'' is a collection
of titles of imaginary research such as ``Salamanders are People
Too'' and ``Canary Row,'' a takeoff on the title of Steinbeck's
``Cannery Row.'' Tuleja's version is the tale told by a canary
taken into coal mines in the 1930s to check the quality of air.
   In ``Lost Books,'' the premise is that despite the tons of
treatises lining bookstores there were books so outlandish they
have been buried. From the first ``book,'' a story in stones from a
prehistoric cave to a New Age classic, ``Ayuh Speaks,'' he lists
100 ``lost books.''
   ``I did a lot of work in literature as a young man and I got
real sick of it. The catalog is my revenge,'' Tuleja said, a grin
taking the sting out of his assessment.
   ``Probably the vast majority of people in academia ... are
bright and interesting,'' he said. ``But there's always (those)
that are around that are into dropping names in 16 languages.''
   ``You only need a few irritating more-subtle-than-thou people
around to turn you against it,'' he said.

   Most people remember Martin Luther King
Jr. and the ultimate price he paid in the struggle for racial
equality. But few know of William Moore and his one-man march
against segregation. Or Emmett Till, who was shot, mutilated and
dumped in a river for speaking to a white woman.
   The creators of the nation's first monument to the martyrs of
the civil rights movement hope to change that, preserving the
memories of fallen heroes and inspiring young people to carry on
their work.
   The stark black Civil Rights Memorial was dedicated Sunday in
Montgomery, the ``Cradle of the Confederacy'' and the city where
King began the national movement for racial justice with a boycott
of buses in 1955 and 1956.
   ``I'm really thankful that he's there,'' said Mary Moore
Birchard of Birchardville, Pa., Moore's wife when he was gunned
down near Attalla in 1963. ``This is the first recognition Bill has
received in 26{ years.''
   ``I was just overwhelmed,'' said Mamie Till Mobley of Chicago,
whose 14-year-old son was slain during a visit to Money, Miss., in
1955. ``I knew it would be moving, but it's something where you
can't anticipate how you will feel.''
   Several of the 5,000 people who attended the ceremony broke down
in tears as they touched the cool water that flows across a
circular black granite slab engraved with a timeline of events of
the civil rights era.
   The slab, which bears the names of 32 blacks and eight whites
who died in the struggle, sits in front of a black granite wall 9
feet high and inscribed with the words King chose from the Bible
for his first speech of the Montgomery bus boycott: ``... Until
justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty
stream.''
   The $700,000 monument at the headquarters of the Southern
Poverty Law Center was designed by Maya Lin, architect of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.
   ``It shows what did happen and what can happen,'' said Julian
Bond, Georgia's first black state legislator since Reconstruction.
``I think it's important that when you lean over to touch a name,
you see your own face reflected in the water.''
   Martin Luther King III, a county commissioner in Atlanta, said:
``It's a tremendous tribute that will be here through the ages for
those yet unborn. ... I look forward to coming back again and
again.''
   After the ceremony, King had his first contact with his father's
former confidant, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, since the
publication of the latter's recent book, which portrayed the elder
King as having a weakness for women.
   Abernathy, who has been scorned by many black leaders because of
his book, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' shook hands and
spoke briefly with his best friend's son.
   ``He expressed the fact that he was hurt,'' Abernathy said. ``I
told him that I love him and he'll understand someday, hopefully.''
   The Southern Poverty Law Center sharply criticized Abernathy for
walking onto the podium at the end of the ceremony and joining
hands with others singing of ``We Shall Overcome.''
   ``His ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into
the fold of the civil rights movement after selling out its most
honored hero,'' it said in a statement.
   Though King's is the most prominent name on the monument, Bond
said it was important to remember other victims of what he called
``American apartheid.''
   ``Without degradating Dr. King, this was a lot more than a
Martin Luther King movement,'' he said. ``Many were ordinary,
everyday people who rose above their ordinariness to make a
difference.''
   Others attending included Ethel Kennedy, widow of Robert
Kennedy; Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her seat to a white
man prompted the Montgomery bus boycott, and Myrlie Evers, widow
slain civil-rights leader Medgar Evars.
   Hoping to use the monument to reach the young, the law center
published a magazine that tells the story of each person named on
the monument, and sent copies to schools around the country.
   On Sunday, 7-year-old Herbert Franklin touched the name of his
grandfather, Herbert Lee, a voter registration worker who was
killed by a white legislator in Liberty, Miss., in 1961.
   ``I've tried to tell my children how their grandfather was
killed,'' said Lee's daughter, Shirley Franklin of Kenner, La.
``Now they can see it for themselves.''

   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, whose
recent memoirs contained embarrassing assertions about the late
Martin Luther King Jr., stirred another furor at the dedication of
the Civil Rights Monument.
   At Sunday's dedication of the memorial to 40 people killed in
the civil rights movement, Abernathy walked unbidden to the front
to join hands with others in singing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   To many who are angry about his portrayal of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. as one with a weakness for women, the appearance at
the Southern Poverty Law Center was an intrusion.
   ``Along with 14,000 other persons, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy was
invited to attend the dedication of the Civil Rights Memorial,''
the law center said in a hastily prepared statement. ``He was not
asked to sit on the podium or make any comments.
   ``His ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into
the fold of the civil rights community after selling out its most
honored hero.''
   Last week, the Atlanta minister wrote to say he wouldn't attend,
officials of the law center said.
   After the ceremony, Abernathy shook hands and exchanged brief
remarks with Martin Luther King III, his first contact with the
King family since his book, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,''
was published last month.
   ``He said he was hurt, and I'm sorry he's hurt,'' Abernathy
said. ``He expressed the sorrow and grief that I have done to his
family. I told him I've told nothing but the truth and didn't think
I was revealing anything new.''
   King, a county commissioner in Atlanta, left quickly after the
ceremony without speaking to reporters.
   Abernathy's book says King was with two women and fought with a
third the night before his assassination in Memphis, Tenn., on
April 4, 1968.
   Many black leaders say the book betrayed the man who made
Abernathy his second-in-command during the turbulent civil rights
era.
   Johnnie Carr, who heads the Montgomery Improvement Association
the elder King founded during the 1950s bus boycott, shook her
finger at Abernathy after the ceremony and was visibly upset about
his book.
   ``We'll talk later,'' she told him.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., one of those who criticized the book,
said he still considered Abernathy a friend.
   ``I have no malice, no ill feeling,'' Lewis said. ``An occasion
like this brings people together and helps them forget about
conflict.''
   Abernathy said he regrets nothing about the book.
   ``In the last speech he made, and I quote, Martin said, `Ralph
David Abernathy is my best friend in the world,''' he said. ``He
would have wanted me to reveal that he was a human being.''

   Eugene C. Dorsey will retire at year's
end as Gannett Foundation president, chief executive officer and
trustee, the foundation announced today.
   Dorsey, 62, is taking an early retirement to devote more time to
Independent Sector, a Washington, D.C.-based coalition of
philanthropic organizations, the foundation said. He was named
Independent Sector chairman last month.
   Dorsey called his tenure with the 54-year-old foundation ``the
most rewarding of his life'' and wished it well under its new
leadership and at its new location.
   The foundation, one of the nation's largest with year-end assets
in 1988 of more than $500 million, will move its headquarters to
Arlington, Va., on Dec. 1.
   Charles L. Overby, 43, will rise from senior vice president to
president and CEO; Gerald M. Sass, 57, from vice
president-education to senior vice president; and Everette E.
Dennis, 47, an executive director of the Gannett Center for Media
Studies at Columbia University, becomes a foundation vice president.
   Dorsey was elected to his current foundation positions in 1981.
He previously had been vice president of Gannett Co. Inc.,
president of one of its regional newspaper groups and publisher of
Gannett newspapers in Rochester, N.Y.; Boise, Idaho; and Lansing,
Mich.

   The officials, who were not identified in keeping with custom,

assassinations in Spain so far this year.
   ETA has killed more than 600 people, mostly military and police
officers since it started a violent campaign for independence of

<HEAD>Kansas City Ponders Sales Tax to Fight Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City area voters, faced with one
of the nation's worst drug problems, will decide Tuesday whether to
raise taxes by $14 million a year to fight back.
   ``We're doing everything we can right now with the money we
have,'' Jackson County prosecutor Albert Riederer told a church
group last week. The additional money, he said, would be used for
more police, prosecutors, courts and drug treatment programs.
   But some community leaders don't like the way the money from the
proposed one-quarter-cent county sales tax would be divided. Some
say 30 percent of the additional money isn't enough for treatment
programs that have six-week to six-month waiting lists for poor
addicts.
   ``If you can pay your own way it's no trouble,'' said Dianne
Cleaver, who runs the mental health department at Swope Parkway
Health Services. ``But if you can't, we can't help you. It's
criminal to keep these people out when they want help.''
   Other groups complain officials aren't using the crime-fighting
resources they already have.
   Rev. Michael Roach, whose coalition of inner-city churches wants
officials to place drug treatment centers on public land and use
health, safety and fire codes to shut down drug houses, said his
group supports the tax.
   ``But what we really need is for the city to make this its first
priority. That's what would really help,'' Roach said.
   Alvin Brooks, the city's human relations director whose Ad Hoc
Group Against Crime has rallied the black community to march
outside crack houses, agrees the tax is flawed. But he thinks it
will pass.
   ``It's going to pass because people are afraid,'' he said.
``They don't know what to do to stop this drug problem. ... If they
vote for this, at least they feel they've done something.''
   Many agree the money would only scratch the surface of Kansas
City's drug problem.
   The area was shocked last year by 136 killings, the
ninth-highest rate in the country, according to the FBI. About 40
percent of those were related to drugs, up from just 6 percent six
years ago, Riederer said.
   The federal government has estimated that the area _ the
nation's 29th largest metropolitan area _ ranks sixth in the
availiability of crack. Three years ago, police presented 60 drug
cases to the county prosecutor's office. This year, the office
already has seen 700.
   The quarter-cent sales tax, which all county residents can vote
on, would generate $98 million, or $14 million each of the seven
years it continues.
   ``We know in general that people say they're willing to pay if
the money is earmarked for drugs,'' Riederer said. ``If we can get
that word out, we have a legitimate chance.''

   Tanzania's Juma Ikangaa broke the course record
by 12 seconds to win the New York City Marathon. Ingrid Kristiansen
of Norway fell just one second short of a course record in winning
the women's division.
   Ikangaa, 32, who trained in the 7,500-foot altitude of Alamosa,
Colo., to improve his finishing strength after coming in second in
three straight marathons, ran away from the pack before the 14-mile
point in Sunday's race and never was seriously challenged.
   He ran the 26-mile, 385-yard race in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 1
second, the 10th-fastest marathon ever and 12 seconds faster than
the course record, by Alberto Salazar in 1981. The course in that
race later was found to be about 100 meters short.
   ``I could have gone another five miles,'' a smiling Ikangaa said.
   Kristiansen, 33, the fastest women's marathoner in history, won
her first New York City Marathon in five tries. Her time of 2:25:30
was one second off the course record also set in 1981, by Allison
Roe of New Zealand.
   Kristiansen broke away early. After 16 miles, she led by more
than two minutes and was on pace to break her world's best of
2:21:06. But stomach problems slowed her considerably.
   ``It was tough to regain my speed after slowing down,'' she said.
   Each winner received $26,385 from the total purse of $302,270,
plus a Mercedes-Benz valued at $32,500.
   Americans Ken Martin and Kim Jones came in second in the men's
and women's divisions, respectively.
   The race, which winds through all five boroughs of the city on a
course lined by an estimated 2.5 million people, was run in crisp
50-degree weather. It attracted more than 23,000 runners.

   Barry Sadler, who co-wrote and sang
the hit Vietnam War-era ``Ballad of the Green Berets,'' died 14
months after being shot in Guatemala, where he reportedly was
training anti-communist Contra fighters.
   He was 49.
   Sadler, who suffered brain damage in the mysterious Sept. 7,
1988, shooting, died Sunday at the Veterans Administration's Alvin
C. York Medical Center, hospital spokesman Albert Archie said. A
cause of death wasn't given and an autopsy will be performed, he
said.
   Then-Army Staff Sgt. Sadler helped write the ballad while
recuperating from a leg wound he suffered while serving as a medic
in Vietnam. The song, the No. 1 hit in the country for five weeks
in 1966, glorified the fighting men of the Special Forces during
the early days of America's involvement in Vietnam.
   He went on to write 20 adventure books featuring a mercenary
named Casca, but never repeated the musical success of the ballad,
which sold 9 million singles and albums. His other efforts included
producing and writing a bicentennial year album called ``Of Thee I
Sing.''
   ``He was a very loyal person with old-fashioned prinicples,''
said a friend, Bill Parrish of Nashville. ``He was a solider. That
was his job. He talked of caring for people and had established a
trust fund for orphans in Vietnam.''
   In recent years, he spent time in Central America.
   Sadler was shot in the head as he got into a taxi in what
authorities said was apparently a robbery attempt. The crime
remains unsolved.
   According to one friend, Duke Faglier, Sadler helped with
firearms training for the U.S.-backed Contras in their fight to
overthrow the Nicaragua's leftist government.
   After Sadler was shot in Guatemala City, Faglier recounted death
threats Sadler had received during five years living in Guatemala.
   ``I'm sure it made us less than popular,'' Faglier said of the
training, without saying who financed the effort.
   Faglier said he shared quarters with Sadler in Central America.
   But another friend, Col. Lew Millet of Idyllwild, Calif.,
discounted Sadler's soldier of fortune image. He said his friend
went to Central America as a soldier and medic.
   ``He liked the people there,'' Millet said. ``I don't think
Barry was directly involved as a soldier of fortune. It keeps you
young to stay in touch with your old profession, and that was
Barry's interest.''
   Since the shooting, he has been hospitalized in Cleveland or at
the VA hospital here named for the World War I hero and Tennessee
native known as Sgt. York. Friends recently described Sadler as
lucid and able to use one arm, though at times during his
hospitalization relatives said he was unable to make legal
decisions for himself.
   Sadler is survived by his wife, Lavona, and three children.

<HEAD>College Faculty Harshly Assess Their Bosses and Their Students</HEAD>

   College students often are willing to cheat and
are obsessed with grades and careers but lack basic skills they
should have learned in high school, according to a poll of
professors.
   Despite this disdain for students and dissatisfaction with
``autocratic'' administrators, more college teachers are satisfied
with their jobs than five years ago, according to the poll released
Sunday.
   Two-thirds of the 5,450 campus faculty polled by the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching believe there has been a
widespread lowering of standards in U.S. higher education.
   Three-quarters consider their students ``seriously unprepared in
basic skills,'' and 68 percent believe colleges spend too much time
and money teaching students what they should have learned in high
school.
   ``Public education, despite six years of reform, is still
producing inadequately prepared students,'' concluded the survey,
``The Condition of the Professoriate: Attitudes and Trends, 1989.''
It was the fourth survey of its kind since 1969.
   Fifty-five percent agreed that most undergraduates at their
schools ``only do enough to get by,'' 70 percent believed students
have become more grade-conscious, and 84 percent agreed that
students have become more careerist in their concerns.
   Forty-three percent said students are more willing to cheat to
get good grades.
   Professors were hardly more flattering about their bosses: 64
percent rated the administration on their campus either ``fair'' or
``poor,'' a percentage hardly changed from surveys in 1984 and 1975.
   Sixty-nine percent regarded administrators as ``autocratic.''
Only half felt their college or university is managed effectively.
   On the other hand, more faculty members expressed overall
satisfaction with their professional lives than five years ago.
   Only 20 percent thought that this is a poor time for young
people to consider academic careers, compared with 50 percent in
1984.
   Seventy-seven percent felt exciting things were taking place in
their disciplines, and an identical percentage disagreed with the
statement, ``If I had it to do over again, I would not become a
college teacher.''
   Nearly half _ 49 percent _ believed job prospects have improved
for undergraduates in their fields.
   Forty-eight percent rated their salaries as good or excellent,
up from 40 percent five years ago. But two-thirds still believed
their salaries have failed to keep up with inflation.
   The campus adage ``publish or perish'' appears as true as ever:
54 percent believed it's difficult to gain tenure without
publishing, compared with 55 percent in 1984. In 1975, just 46
percent felt that way, and in the first such Carnegie survey, in
1969, the number was 41 percent.
   Professors in all disciplines but engineering also gave a
ringing endorsement to liberal arts: 56 percent agreed that
undergraduate study in America would be improved if there were less
stress on specialized training and more on liberal education,
compared with 51 percent in 1984.
   Only 19 percent of engineering faculty felt that way.
   ``The good news is that faculty are more committed to liberal
education than five years ago. And our conclusion is that the
profession is healthier now,'' said foundation president Ernest L.
Boyer in an interview.
   ``On the dark side are the harshly negative faculty feelings
about the academic preparation of their students.''
   The survey, conducted in February by mail by the Wirthlin Group,
of McLean, Va., had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 1
percentage point.
   There are approximately 489,000 full-time college faculty in
U.S. institutions of higher education, according to federal
statistics.

<TEXT>
   The new president, lawnker Rene Mouawad,
is an art lover who favors Christian-Moslem reconciliation despite
his backing by the three largest Maronite Catholic clans that
dominate the mountainous north.
   Mouawad, from the rugged region of Zghorta, is often referred to
as ``the cool Zghortan.''
   Parliament elected the 64-year-old Mouawad Sunday as the
country's ninth president under terms of an Arab-brokered peace
plan aimed at ending a civil war that has killed more than 150,000
people.
   Mouawad, a member of Parliament for 32 years, was first elected
for the Zghorta region in 1957 when he was 32.
   His wife, Naila, hails from the Issa Khoury clan. They and the
Mouawads are allied with the powerful Franjiehs in the northeastern
Zghorta region.
   The Franjiehs, who have their own Marada, or Tigers, militia,
are headed by former president Suleiman Franjieh, one of the last
of the old-style Maronite warlords.
   Mouawad graduated from the French-affiliated St. Joseph
University in Christian east Beirut with a law degree in 1947. He
started his own practice in the northern provincial capital of
Tripoli two years later but gave it up when he entered Parliament.
   He was named Minister of Telegraphs and Telecommunications in
1961 and held the post until February 1964. He was named Minister
of Public Works in 1969 and Minister of Education in 1980.
   While he held the education portfolio, Mouawad sliced through
sectarian hatreds to organize examinations for Christian and Moslem
youngsters whose studies were interrupted by war. In 1981 he
established a ``zone of legitimacy'' where all students could take
their exams.
   He requisitioned all schools in the Hazmiyeh, Jomhour and
Fayadiyeh districts east of Beirut so students could do their work,
protected by a multi-sect brigade from the Lebanese army. It was
the first time in six years Christian and Moslem students had been
able to do that.
   Mouawad's effort was expanded to include students from villages
in the Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon.
   His love of art led him to sponsor an operation to salvage 1,000
paintings and sculptures from Education Ministry warehouses set on
fire in Israeli air raids July 18, 1982, during Israel's invasion
of Lebanon.
   Seventy policemen rescued most of the works from warehouses in
Moslem west Beirut and stored them in underground vaults of the
Central Bank.
   Mouawad took part in the 20-member ``national dialogue
committee'' formed in September 1975 to find a settlement to the
civil war, then five months old, but that peace effort collapsed.
   Mouawad and his wife married in February 1965 and had their
first child, Michael, later that year. They also have a daughter,
Rima, 22.

<HEAD>Showdown Over Trash Burner in Spokane Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next mayor of Spokane will be elected
on a platform of garbage.
   Two years after a contract was signed to build a municipal trash
incinerator, the stalled project remains a divisive issue that has
dominated this year's race for mayor.
   The lone City Council member to oppose the burner is considered
the front-runner. Sheri Barnard received 52 percent of the vote in
September's mayoral primary, nearly double the total of her
runner-up, Councilman Rob Higgins, whom she faces in Tuesday's
non-partisan runoff.
   Higgins says Barnard won the primary because of an
anti-incinerator ``fringe'' group that doesn't reflect true public
opinion. He insists the electricity-generating ``waste-to-energy''
plant is the best solution to Spokane's garbage problem, and
emphasizes that nine of 10 city and county elected officials
support the project.
   ``It's just a matter of time before people realize they're
right,'' he said.
   However, one poll suggests that time hasn't come. The poll,
published last week by The Spokesman-Review and Spokane Chronicle,
showed Barnard leading Higgins by 46 percent to 27 percent.
   Both candidates have tried to raise other issues but have been
unable to shift the focus from the $134 million waste disposal
system built around the incinerator.
   Barnard says she is the only elected official who has listened
to residents who tried unsuccessfully to get a vote on the
incinerator in 1987. The state Supreme Court disallowed the attempt
to place the issue on the ballot.
   Opponents say the burner would harm residents' health and the
environment.
   ``Seventy percent of the people wanted to vote on this in 1987,
and that vote was denied to them. They're still very angry over
that,'' Barnard said.
   She said opponents also were angered that the plant's location
was moved to a site near Spokane International Airport without a
public hearing.
   Higgins maintains that the plant would pose no significant
risks, and that more hearings have been held about it than any
other public works project in Spokane.
   Higgins has warned that canceling the project would risk
Spokane's economic development. Cancellation would cost $55 million
to $70 million, he said. Barnard places the amount at $12 million
and said that would be far less costly than paying off construction
bonds over 20 years.
   Higgins has attacked Barnard for offering no workable
alternative to the trash burner. She says she favors more recycling
and has suggested shipping Spokane's solid waste to a new regional
landfill, building a state-of-the-art landfill in Spokane County or
building an industrial composting plant.

<HEAD>Casino Debate Now Goes To Legislature After Clearing Referendum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gambling supporters are betting they can
persuade a skeptical governor and legislators to follow the lead of
Gary voters and approve construction of casinos on the city's Lake
Michigan shoreline.
   Voters in this economically depressed steel town endorsed casino
gambling by a wide margin in a non-binding referendum Saturday,
setting the stage for a battle in the 1990 General Assembly over
casino legislation.
   ``An opportunity for jobs and economic revitalization _ that's
going to be the pitch,'' said state Rep. Earline S. Rogers, D-Gary.
``In the absence of the state coming up with a way to solve our
problems, we've come up with something ourselves.''
   Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh tempered his opposition to the idea in
comments after the vote _ but only slightly.
   ``I'm opposed to casino gambling, but I'm willing to sit down
and look at all the arguments for and against and I have yet to do
that,'' Bayh said. ``You never say never.''
   There's little chance a casino bill would get far in the 1990
General Assembly session if the governor threatens a veto, said
House Republican Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler.
   Democratic Mayor Thomas V. Barnes and other Gary casino
advocates believe the city could support five lakefront
casino-hotels, which would create 25,000 casino-related jobs and
another 10,000 jobs for construction workers.
   Those figures, coupled with a 60.4 percent vote in favor of
casinos, make a strong case, casino advocates believe. Of the
22,042 people who voted, 13,309 favored casinos and 8,733, or 39.6
percent, were opposed. Turnout was 32.3 percent.
   ``The more we tell our story, the more people look at the
numbers, the more inclined they are to look at the opportunity
favorably,'' said Robert Spolyar, a lobbyist for casino operator
Resorts International of Atlantic City, N.J. ``I think we've got a
50 percent chance and I'm conservative.''
   Bayh said he believed the referendum result is important but
uncompelling, given the low voter turnoutt.
   The mayor said the turnout was modest because of the city's
first-ever Saturday voting, an experiment with electronic voting
machines that intimidated some voters and the decision to save
money by opening just 18 polling places instead of the usual 155.
   Any effort to bring gambling here faces an uphill battle because
of moral objections, Mannweiler said.
   ``In my mind, even though Gary says this is a local-option
issue, that we ought to help Gary help themselves, casino gambling
is not something I look very favorably on seeing in the state of
Indiana anywhere,'' said Mannweiler.

<HEAD>Driver's Murder Trial Nears in Crash that Killed 27</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a driver who allegedly drank
as much as a case of beer before a fiery crash that killed 27
members of a church youth group hope to turn the murder trial into
a forum on school bus safety.
   The crash _ the nation's second-worst involving a school bus and
most deadly blamed on drunken driving _ already has prompted
sweeping safety proposals from the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   And the judge who will preside over the trial set to begin
Wednesday has ruled that attorneys for defendant Larry Mahoney can
introduce evidence that the design of the 12-year-old bus
contributed to the smoke-inhalation deaths of 24 children and 3
adults on May 14, 1988.
   Mahoney's pickup truck was traveling the wrong way on Interstate
71 outside Carrollton, near the Ohio-Kentucky line, when it slammed
into the school bus carrying members of the First Assembly of God.
Among the group returning home to Radcliff from an outing at a
Cincinnati amusement park, one adult and 39 youths escaped, some
with serious injuries.
   The crash blocked the front door and sent choking clouds of
smoke through the bus as seat covers burned.
   After studying the crash, the NTSB in March urged that the
oldest 20 percent of the nation's school buses be taken off the
road because of safety flaws. The board also recommended stricter
standards for fuel tank protection, emergency exits and the
flammability of seat covers on school buses.
   Defense attorney Bill Summers said the defense will try to
convince jurors the bus's design flaws are at least partly to blame
for the deaths.
   ``No one died or was injured by the accident itself,'' Summers
said last week.
   He complained that Mahoney's reputation was damaged in NTSB
hearings. The attorney likened the hearings to the Salem witch
trials, but said Mahoney acknowledges a role in the deaths and
injuries.
   ``He believes that he had a part in it, yes,'' Summers said,
adding, ``He's not a murderer.''
   Special prosecutor Paul Richwalsky will argue that Mahoney is
responsible for the deaths under a 1984 state law that makes a
drunken driver guilty of murder if he ``wantonly engages in conduct
which creates a grave risk of death of another person.''
   Rejecting the bus-safety reasoning, Richwalsky said, ``The
defense is always looking for somebody or something else to blame.''
   The defendant's blood-alcohol level was found to be 0.26 percent
90 minutes after the accident, and an NTSB expert testified during
board hearings that at the time of the 10:55 p.m. accident it
likely would have been 0.29 percent.
   That is nearly three times the state's definition of drunken
driving and two-thirds of a lethal dose of alcohol, said NTSB
investigator John Moulden, who estimated Mahoney would have
consumed a case _ 24 cans _ of light beer to reach that level.
   Summers ruled out a last-minute plea-bargain before the Carroll
Circuit trial begins.
   The defense argued in pretrial motions that blood test evidence
being used by Richwalsky should be excluded as illegally obtained,
but Judge Charles Satterwhite rejected that contention.
   The NTSB concluded the probable cause of the accident was
Mahoney's drunkenness. Contributing to the deaths, the board found,
was the puncturing of the bus's fuel tank and the resulting fire,
as well as its flammable seat cushions and bench seats that partly
blocked the rear emergency door. The Kentucky medical examiner
blamed the deaths on smoke inhalation and said none of those aboard
was seriously injured by the impact.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed an activist in
the Palestinian uprising before dawn today as he tried to flee into
Jordan, the military commmand said.
   An army spokesman said the shooting occurred north of Mehola, an
Israeli collective settlement in the occupied West Bank about 40
miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under military rules,
said an army patrol in the area spotted two suspicious-looking men
moving toward the Jordanian border. They opened fire, wounding one.
   The injured man was treated by a military doctor but died of his
wounds, the spokesman said. He added that ``it is very possible
that his colleague succeeded to escape into Jordan.''
   The military identified the victim as Wail Mahmad Daoud Haj
Hassan, 20, of Qalqilya in the West Bank.
   He was wanted by the security forces for the past two years on
suspicion of firebombing Israeli cars and attacking Arabs suspected
of assisting Israeli authorities, the army spokesman said.
   In uprising violence, Mohammed Dulani, a 37-year-old resident of
Jenin in the West Bank, was brought to Rafidiya Hospital in Nablus
late Sunday with beating and stab wounds to his back, head and
hands, doctors said. Arab journalists said he was suspected of
being a collaborator with the Israelis.
   At least 141 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs on
suspicion of helping Israel during the 22-month revolt in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   In other violence, a 15-year-old Palestinian was shot and
wounded in a clash with troops in the occupied Gaza Strip today,
Arab doctors said.
   About 611 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in
the uprising. Forty Israelis also have died in the violence.

   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies except the British pound and Canadian dollar in early
European trading today. Gold prices fell slightly.
   Currency dealers said trading was quiet and listless and, in the
absence of economic indicators, they predicted little movement for
the rest of the week.
   ``It's very quiet now and we don't expect much movement for a
while,'' said one trader in Rome.
   Traders elsewhere said the dollar continued to benefit from
better-than-expected U.S. unemployment figures released Friday.
Some said the currency could get a boost from U.S. Treasury bill
auctions scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.30 yen to a closing 143.45 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.8508 West German marks, up from 1.8470
   _1.6240 Swiss francs, up from 1.6210
   _6.2788 French francs, up from 6.2620
   _2.0917 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0825
   _1,358.25 Italian lire, up from 1,356.25
   _1.1715 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1723
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5741 to buy one pound, more expensive for buyers than $1.5705
late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $377.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $378.85. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $378.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $378.00, down from $380.75 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.32 to close at a bid $378.55.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.23 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.28.

   The wet weather followed a cold front crossing the Mississippi
Valley. The showers and thunderstorms were most numerous from
eastern Wisconsin and northern Illinois to Indiana and southern
Michigan. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were over Arkansas
and southeastern Missouri.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also reported in south central
and southeastern Texas in response to an upper level weather
disturbance moving out of Mexico.
   A few rain showers were scattered across Montana, while snow was
reported in northeast Minnesota, near Lake Superior, on Sunday
evening.
   Temperatures reached the 80s Sunday from the Rio Grande Valley
of Texas through Florida, and in Southern California and southern
Arizona. Several Texas cities had recored high temperatures for the
date.
   Highs were in the 60s and 70s across the Ohio Valley and the
middle Mississippi Valley, the 30s in eastern North Dakota,
Northern Minnesota and northern Maine.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 91 degrees at Kingsville,
Texas.

   ``Art is not nice,'' intones Macheath, also
known as Mack the Knife, the villainous dandy of London's Soho
underworld.
   It is an opinion that the director and much of the cast of a
new, heavy-handed production of ``3 Penny Opera'' affirm over and
over during what seem like three long acts.
   The quirky spelling of its title aside, this revival, which
opened Sunday at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theater, offers few
surprises or insights into a classic piece of musical theater. Its
main draw, at least at the box office, is Sting, the golden-haired
rock star making his Broadway debut as Mack.
   Sting certainly looks the part _ a sinister, sexy Peter Pan done
up in waist coat, spats and white gloves. His acting has a
rudimentary charm. But he has trouble barking out the savage lyrics
_ Michael Feingold's new translation of Bertolt Brecht _ and
negotiating composer Kurt Weill's difficult melodic line.
   That's one of the show's problems. Sting is the weakest
performer in the musical, and Macheath is its centerpiece. It's his
brutal story that Brecht and Weill tell with such irony. Mack
secretly marries the virginal Polly Peachum, daughter of a big Soho
crime boss. Her parents plot to have him hanged, and he goes in
jail. Eventually Mack ends up on the gallows, only to be pardoned
before the noose is tied around his neck.
   Brecht and Weill told their story with wicked glee. But much of
it is smothered here by director John Dexter. His bunch of ragtag
ruffians and dispossessed are particularly unconvincing. They mouth
Brecht's messages about the downtrodden but look as if they are
just playing at being poor.
   In true Brechtian style, a white curtain swirls across the stage
between scenes, and song titles are projected onto screens on
either side of the stage. A narrator introduces each scene. He also
gets to sing ``Mack the Knife,'' the one song everyone knows from
the score.
   The narrator is played by Ethyl Eichelberger, a cadaverous,
bald-headed Ray Bolger look-alike. The loose-limbed Eichelberger
gets the majority of choreographer Peter Gennaro's meager dance
steps. Except for a wan tango for Sting and Suzzanne Douglas, one
of Macheath's brothel playmates, there is little formal movement in
the show.
   Other cast members have a good handle on the music's peculiar
style. Georgia Brown, as the revengeful Mrs. Peachum, seizes the
score with a zestiness missing from the rest of the production.
Alvin Epstein, as her equally unremorseful husband, exudes a fine
comic sensibility. So does Kim Criswell as Lucy Brown, a spurned
girlfriend who helps Mack escape from jail. She also possesses one
of the strongest voices in the cast.
   Nancy Ringham, temporarily replacing the indisposed Maureen
McGovern, is a real find, an actress who can sing. Her Polly
Peachum is sweet but not simpering, a woman who quickly embraces
the criminal life of her husband.
   The scenic design by Jocelyn Herbert confines the show, rather
than liberating it. The small orchestra is perched above the
playing area, forcing everything to be played down front, center
stage. The thin settings, from stable to shop to brothel to prison
to the gallows, fly down from the proscenium arch or barrel in from
the wings.
   Dexter's last Broadway show, ``M. Butterfly,'' had a surprising
amount of theatricality for a play, a perfect combination of
setting, costumes, lighting and the right actors. Now dealing with
a musical, he restricts his imagination and the characters to
reiterating what Brecht and Weill want to say.
   ``First comes the feeding, then the moral code,'' goes one of
Brecht's more trenchant lines. But with this new ``3 Penny Opera,''
it's impossible to care who eats whom or what to survive. Only the
message gets batted home now _ with deadening results.
   In other reviews:
   _The play ``may have Sting, but it has no sting,'' wrote Howard
Kissel in Monday's Daily News. ``Nothing about this production
suggests that live theater can be as exciting as MTV.''
   _``Sting is a stiff onstage,'' Frank Rich wrote in today's
editions of The New York Times. And, ``Far from trying to tart up
`Threepenny Opera' for Broadway, Mr. Dexter makes the show look so
spartan that by contrast `Our Town' might seem decadent.''
   _Clive Barnes in Monday's New York Post gave a favorable review,
praising the show as ``Quite effortlessly _ the best musical in
town, this season, next season and for anticipated time. ...
   ``Shiftless, shifty and determinedly dishonorable, Sting has a
natural presence and makes a debonair bandit-villain,'' said Barnes.

   Tammy Faye Bakker asked worshippers to help
pay off her storefront church's $400,000 debt and find new quarters
for the ministry that's facing eviction from a suburban shopping
mall.
   The wife of jailed evangelist Jim Bakker urged about 100 people
at a Sunday service to be ``faithful in your tithings,'' suggesting
God is more likely to answer the prayers of those to contribute to
their churches.
   ``That is what God can do for you if you are faithful to him,''
she said.
   Mrs. Bakker said next week's services might be held in the
rented space in the Shoppers World mall, even though mall owner
Stewart Gilman is demanding she move out.
   Sunday night, an angry Gilman threatened legal action.
   ``I'm disgusted,'' he said. ``You cannot have someone stay in a
property indefinitely.''
   He refused to reveal financial details of the dispute.
   Tammy Bakker asked the congregation to help the ministry find a
new site to lease _ preferably for no more than $5 per square foot.
   ``We are going to try to move out of here as quickly as
possible,'' she said. ``But unless you hear differently, we'll be
here next Sunday.''
   Bakker, who was convicted Oct. 5 of federal fraud and conspiracy
charges for diverting money invested in enterprises connected with
his PTL television ministry, is serving a 45-year sentence at the
Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Tamils Fight in Big Clash After Indian Pullout</HEAD>

   A leading Tamil rebel group raided
camps of rival factions in an eastern district, leaving 47 dead in
the first major inter-Tamil clash since Indian peacekeeping forces
withdrew, military officials said today.
   Two supporters of the rebel group that launched the attack were
publicly executed in retaliation, area residents said.
   One Tamil activist warned of a ``bloodbath'' now that the
Indians are gone from the area.
   Sunday's fighting took place at Tampiluvil and Tamputte villages
20 miles southeast of Ampara town.
   Military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said about 250 members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam raided two military camps run by rivals and killed 41 men. At
least six Tigers also were killed in the fighting, they said.
   The Tigers are the largest and most militant of the minority
Tamil groups fighting a 6-year-old separatist war with the
government.
   Angered by Sunday's attack, members of the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front publicly executed two Tiger
supporters in neighboring Akkaraipattu, according to residents
contacted by telephone.
   Residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two
were shot.
   The camps raided by the Tigers apparently are run by a shadowy
group known as the Tamil National Army, a militia organized by
former rebel groups to keep order in the area.
   A Tiger leader in Colombo, who confirmed the attack, said,
``Action has been taken to dismantle the illegal Tamil National
Army.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity and did not eleborate.
   Military officials said 140 members of the Civilian Volunteer
Force and Tamil National Army were either captured by the Tigers or
surrendered during the attack. The Tigers also drove away two
tractor loads of weapons, including 100 rifles, they said.
   A leader of the Eelam Revolutionary Organization, a Tamil group
closely associated the Tigers, warned of more clashes.
   ``There is no proper apparatus to look the law-and-order
situation, which means there will be a bloodbath among the
groups,'' Velupillai Balakumar told reporters today.
   However, Sri Lankan Army Commander Lt. Gen. Hamilton Wanasinghe
said Sunday that troops had been rushed to the area to halt
violence.
   India withdrew about 4,000 soldiers from Ampara district two
weeks ago, heightening fears of inter-Tamil fighting.
   The fighting marked a new phase in the struggle by the Tamil
Tigers and other guerrilla groups for a separate Tamil homeland in
the north and east.
   Most groups gave up the armed uprising under an India-mediated
accord in July 1987. The Tamil Tigers briefly accepted the
agreement but later rejected it.
   Indian soldiers came to Sri Lanka to supervise the accord. The
force has been withdrawn in phases, and the remaining 36,000
soldiers are scheduled to leave by Dec. 31.
   Tamil militants are demanding a separate nation, claiming
discrimination by the majority Sinhalese.
   Tamils are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. The predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese comprise 75
percent of the population and dominate the government and military.

   Greece's political crisis deepended again
today after the conservative New Democrats, for the second time in
five months, narrowly missed achieving a parliamentary majority in
national elections.
   A tough period of bargaining was expected to begin shortly on
forming a new government, with the country's three major parties
widely divided over economic policy and the presence of U.S.
military bases.
   The result of Sunday's election could be another life for
Andreas Papandreou's Socialists, who were felled in June's vote due
in part to a banking scandal that has led to the former prime
minister being indicted.
   A government dominated by the Socialists would almost certainly
include Communists.
   With 98 percent of the vote counted, New Democracy, led by
Constantine Mitsotakis, had 46.3 percent for 148 seats in the
300-seat Parliament.
   That was three more than it won in June but three short of the
number needed to control the government after eight years of
Socialist rule and a brief coalition administration.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, won 40.7
percent of the vote for 128 seats, a gain of three. The
Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress got 10.8 percent
of the vote and 21 seats, a loss of seven.
   The other three seats went to independents _ a leftist backed
jointly by PASOK and the Coalition, a Greek-Moslem and an
environmentalist for the first time in Greece's political history.
   ``Without a doubt, our political life is entering a difficult
phase,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference on Sunday. e was
expected to receive a presidential mandate within 48 hours to try
forming a new government.
   After the June election, his party joined with the Communist-led
Coalition of the Left and Progress in an unusual alliance to launch
investigations of scandals under Papandreou.
   That administration resigned last month after Parliament
indicted Papandreou on charges of involvement in the
multimillion-dollar banking scandal and of ordering wiretapping of
the telephones of his friends and foes.
   Papandreou has denied the charges.
   ``It gives us special satisfaction that after the June
elections, we have had such a significant rise ... despite the
unbelievable barrage of attacks against us and despite the fact
that we were out of the government,'' he told reporters on Sunday.
   The leftist Coalition's loss of seven seats in Sunday's poll
suggested their supporters were unhappy about the alliance with
conservatives.
   The Communists vowed before the election that they would not
work with the conservatives again. However, they also said they
would not support the Socialists with Papandreou as leader.
   After the Socialists' strong showing, it seemed certain that
they would insist on keeping Papandreou in place.
   The Athens Stock Exchange today reflected disappointment in the
election results.
   ``Every stock opened lower this morning, apparently reacting to
the economic uncertainty we are in store for,'' said a broker
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The daily Kathimerini newspaper, which supports the
conservatives, called for ``a repeat of the successful
cooperation'' between New Democracy and the leftist Coalition.
   Mitsotakis, 71, campaigned on promises to cut the government's
heavy role in the economy and strengthen ties with NATO and the
United States. He accuses the former Socialist government of
ruining the economy.
   Papandreou, 70, promised to boost pensions and other benefits.
He said he would hold a referendum before approving any new base
treaty with the United States.
   The Coalition wants to remove U.S. bases from Greece and favors
a strictly controlled economy.
   The inconclusive elections in June ended a 15-year period of
stable government dominated by Papandreou and another charismatic
politician, pro-Western Constantine Caramanlis, who founded New
Democracy in 1974.
   Sunday's was the sixth election since the return to democracy
after the 1967-74 military dictatorship.

<TEXT>
   One evening at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, four
balalaikas serenaded Vladimir Horowitz on his return to his native
land after more than a half century. Suddenly, the virtuoso pianist
grabbed a fork and started tinkling his own accompaniment on the
empty bottles at his table.
   ``He would do things nobody else would dare ... like a volcanic
rock opening,'' said Mark Sydorak, a pianist and recording engineer.
   Earlier that evening in 1986, Horowitz drew tears from a Soviet
audience when he appeared on stage in the Communist country he had
vowed never to see again.
   But Horowitz, who died Sunday at the age of 85, had never really
left.
   Through his playing breathed the grand Russian romantic style
that is ending with his death _ a fiery explosion of technique,
emotion and elegance.
   ``He hypnotized us; we were jumping out of our seats,'' said
Vladimir Viardo, a Soviet pianist in New York who was in the
audience for that Moscow concert.
   ``A whole epoch went away with his death. We have lost a branch
of pianism _ an old-fashioned, elegant style that we will never
meet again. He was a direct descent of the school of the 19th
century,'' said Viardo, who is the only Soviet artist allowed to
move to the West while retaining his citizenship.
   ``We all thought he was going to live forever, he was so
joyful,'' he added.
   As Horowitz's concerts became more infrequent, people flocked to
each one as if going on a pilgrimage.
   ``The biggest mistake that people made is that they classified
him as some sort of a super-technician. I think his greatest asset
was in his musicianship,'' said Sydorak. ``He was well beyond any
pianist, multidimensional as opposed to other greats such as
(Artur) Rubinstein.''
   The aura he generated was only enhanced by his absence from the
stage from 1953 to 1965 after he reportedly suffered a nervous
breakdown. But the high-strung, neurotic sensibility that brought
him to that edge also nourished his playing.
   Horowitz's pianistic electricity was indelibly marked by that
personality. His enormous, lightning-quick fingers drew the most
surprising pianissimos and powerful fortissimos from the keyboard.
   Long after he became a musical icon, an almost childlike
insecurity pushed him to prove himself again and again.
   ``He felt that his fingers were made out of glass and that they
would break,'' said Sydorak, who has heard every concert Horowitz
played in New York since his comeback in 1965. ``He was scared of
the stage. ... But he came back because he longed for the stage.''
   To reassure the pianist, Horowitz's psychiatrist reportedly
stood in the wings during the performances.
   And as his age grew, so did Horowitz's other eccentricities.
   He refused concerts in any place that could not produce filet of
sole for his meals, prepared by his travel-along cook.
   Also traveling with him was the only instrument on which he
would play _ the Steinway concert grand that was a gift from the
piano maker on the occasion of Horowitz's wedding in 1933. Horowitz
allowed it to be adjusted only by one technician, Franz Mohr, for
the unique bell-like resonance that filled the great concert halls
_ and later televisions _ of the world.
   What one saw towering above the keyboard were Horowitz's
sprightly, amused eyes, still animated by a curiosity that spilled
into his fresh, witty musical explorations.
   Horowitz pranced lightly on his personal keyboard, specially
made so he didn't have to push the keys down far and could play in
an unusual, almost flat position.
   ``He would play with flat hands. His technique was especially
elegant; he had inner power. The little passages made you
ticklish,'' said Viardo. ``He had extreme inner freedom and
musicality. He was just pure music, with a great release inside.''
   As he passed his 80s, Horowitz changed his repertoire, replacing
some of the flashiest, most difficult pieces with the elegant
simplicity of Mozart or the depth of Bach.
   ``But his technique did not deteriorate,'' said Sydorak.
   Neither did his need for approval.
   ``He was praising himself all the time. He needed it _ but he
got the praise,'' said Viardo. ``His art was profound; he was not.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told economists to
be cautious as they try to ease shortages and strengthen the ruble
because he said consumers will rebel against radical change,
according to a report published today.
   Gorbachev's comments were aimed at economists who argue that
imposition of a market economy could quickly solve the problem of
shortages and bolster the nearly worthless Soviet currency.
   ``I know only one thing, that after two weeks such a `market'
would bring the whole nation out on the streets and sweep out any
government, even one declaring devotion to the people,'' he said.
   Economists must not only take into account what the economy
needs, but what people are willing to accept politically, Gorbachev
said.
   ``We must look at how much this or that proposal takes reality
into account, and how it will be accepted and digested in the minds
of the people,'' the Soviet leader told a conference of economic
specialists.
   The comments were reported today in the Communist Party daily
Pravda. It did not say when the conference was held.
   Gorbachev reiterated that the country must not turn back to its
old administrative methods or embrace capitalism.
   He said the current economic woes stem from a reform program
that has not been completely worked out yet
   The changes are aimed at developing a still ill-defined
socialist market system.
   Economist Oleg T. Bogomolov, a prominent economist who sits on
the Congress of People's Deputies and directs the Institute of the
World Socialist System, complained of ``large social limitations''
in economic policy to steady the plunging value of the ruble.
   ``It's impossible to touch prices seriously. It's impossible to
freeze salaries,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said work was under way on a comprehensive program of
economic reforms that would be presented to the Congress,
presumably when it meets in December.
   He did not give details, but he said the changes would deal with
the country's finances and the consumer market as well. He also
said they would further refine the strategy of reform.

   The Soviet Union today eulogized native son
Vladimir Horowitz as a musical phenomenon whose brilliance belonged
to neither the United States nor the Soviet Union, but to the world.
   Horowitz, born in Kiev in imperial Russia in 1904, died Sunday
in New York, where he had lived more than 60 years. He was 85.
   He left this country in 1925 and returned only once, 61 years
later, enrapturing fans in concert halls in Moscow and Leningrad.
   ``This death is a tremendous loss not only for musicians, but
for the whole world since Horowitz was one of the greatest
phenomena of our time,'' said Boris Pokrovsky, the artistic
director of Moscow's Bolshoi Theater.
   ``He belonged to all peoples, all countries; not Russia or
America. Thank God that something, at least, was recorded for
posterity,'' Pokrovsky said.
   The death of Horowitz was reported too late in New York on
Sunday to make today's edition of the only national daily newspaper
that publishes on Monday, the Communist Party paper Pravda.
   But official Radio Moscow and the Tass news agency both issued
reports today, a holidary preceding Tuesday's celebration of the
72nd anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution.
   Radio Moscow recalled Horowitz's return to his native land in
April 1986 and said ``his performances in halls filled to capacity
are still alive in the memories of music lovers in this country.''
   Tass called him a ``remarkable improvisor'' who emphasized
emotion in his performances.
   Despite the suspicions of the Cold War years, Horowitz was
well-known in the Soviet Union.
   His return for concerts at Moscow's Tchaikovsky Hall and the
Leningrad Philharmonic was an outgrowth of improving relations
between the two superpowers that included growing cultural
exchanges.
   In Moscow, Horowitz's April 20, 1986, concert drew hundreds of
people who lined streets and alleys near the Tchaikovsky Hall,
asking every passer-by if they had an extra ticket. Only about 400
tickets for the 1,800-seat hall went on public sale, and the rest
were given to officials, well-known musicians, or handed out by the
U.S. Embassy to music students.
   ``You can't sense his age at all,'' Soviet composer Alfred
Schnitke said at the time. ``He plays with total freedom, but at
the same time with great control.''
   Vladimir Feltsman, a young Soviet pianist who has since won his
struggle to emigrate to the United States, said of Horowitz's
performance in Moscow: ``I have no words. I could just go home and
kill myself happily after hearing this.''

   It is still a crime to insult the
royal family in the Netherlands, as a 24-year-old Dutchman recently
learned when he was fined 500 guilders ($230) for displaying a
poster depicting Queen Beatrix as a pig.
   Most Dutch frown on insults to the House of Orange, whose fate
and fortunes have been entwined with the Low Countries for 400
years.
   Periodic polls indicate the public overwhelmingly favors
retaining its constitutional monarchy.
   ``The Orange family belongs to the antique furniture that we've
inherited, and it would be unwise to do away with it _ they might
be very valuable,'' said historian Coenraad Tamse of Groningen
University. ``They offer a simple icon of the continuity of Dutch
nationa identity.''
   Since 1898, the Dutch have been led by three queens _ the dour
Wilhelmina, a symbol of hope during the five-year Nazi occupation;
the motherly Juliana, and now the practical Beatrix, who has a
strong sense of her role in Dutch life.
   ``Beatrix has a very strong notion of historic continuity, even
though nothing could be further apart than the role of 16th-century
William and hers,'' said royalty writer Fred Lammers, referring to
Prince William of Orange, who led the Dutch fight for independence
from Spain in the 16th century.
   Although the 51-year-old Beatrix is far from a figurehead, her
official statements are closely tailored to fit the policy of the
elected government.
   An attractive woman with the characteristic ruddy cheeks of her
countrymen, Beatrix is unpretentious in public and dresses like a
prosperous middle-class matron.
   She and her husband, Claus, a former West German diplomat, mix
easily with the public and eschew extravagance.
   But Beatrix reportedly is concerned with maintaining respect for
the monarchy and insists on being called ``Majesty,'' rather than
``Ma'am,'' which her mother Juliana preferred.
   Over the centuries, the House of Orange has survived financial
and romantic scandal, as well as occupation by Napoleon's forces in
1795-1812 and by Hitler's in 1940-45. Both times its members fled
to England.
   Its current hallowed image dates from Wilhelmina, Beatrix's
grandmother, who was ``groomed to fit the mold formed by the
supposed Dutch national traits: virtuousness, diligence, charity,
religiosity, and aversion to violence,'' Professor Tamse said.
   Wilhelmina's bond with her people was irrevocably forged by her
frequent morale-boosting radio speeches from London during World
War II.
   Periodic scandals have failed to tarnish the Orange image.
   During the 1950s there was Queen Juliana's reported dependence
on a faith healer, which the media attributed to her depression
over the near-blindness of her daughter, Princess Christina, born
in 1947.
   In 1964, daughter Princess Irene enraged hard-line Protestant
factions by rejecting the royal family's Dutch Reformed Protestant
faith for Roman Catholicism to marry Prince Carlos Hugo de
Bourbon-Parma, a pretender to the Spanish throne.
   Juliana's husband, Prince Bernhard, was Dutch industry's
unofficial ambassador until his implication in the Lockheed bribery
scandal in 1975.
   He was stripped of his rank as inspector-general of the Dutch
armed forces but is still highly popular and active in conservation
issues.
   Even the royal family's wealth _ reported to range from $80
million to $4.4 billion _ has failed to incite popular resentment.
   Beatrix and her family live in Huis ten Bosch (House in the
Woods), an estate in The Hague visible from the public highway.
Except for state occasions, Beatrix is driven around in a Ford.
   Their three sons study in the state-run university system and
room with friends.
   The heaviest public insult to the monarchy came in 1980, when
Juliana abdicated in favor of Beatrix. During the inauguration _
Dutch monarchs are not crowned _ stone-throwing squatters rioted
outside.
   ``In hindsight, the inauguration riots had less to do with the
monarchy than with anything else _ the housing situation,
unemployment, and the like,'' writer Lammers said. ``But as
national symbols, the royals bore the brunt of the unrest.''
   Despite her circumscribed role, Beatrix's interest in government
is keen, according to sources close to the royal family.
   She meets every Monday morning with Premier Ruud Lubbers and has
at least one extensive policy discussion a week with other Cabinet
ministers.
   The royals draw a line at exploitation of their private life by
the popular press.
   Four years ago, Claus obtained a court-ordered retraction from a
Dutch magazine for an unsubstantiated story alleging that their
eldest son, Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, spent the night with a
``mysterious blonde'' in an Amsterdam hotel.

   Mannheim Steamroller, which cut America's No.
1-selling holiday album last year, teamed up with talk show host
Larry King to find the heartbeat of Christmas this year.
   King, who had bypass surgery after a heart attack two years ago,
and Mannheim Steamroller composer Chip Davis hope the Christmas
cassette of King's words and Davis' music will raise money for the
Larry King Cardiac Foundation.
   The foundation helps people who can't afford heart bypass
surgery. The $10 tape grew out of Davis' appearance on King's radio
show last December.
   ``I wanted to do something for people who couldn't afford''
heart surgery, Davis said in Omaha last week during a recording
break.
   ``I remember listening to one of his tapes in my car one week
before my (heart) surgery,'' King said in a telephone interview
from Arlington, Va.
   The 14-minute tape features King's essay on growing up in New
York's Brooklyn: celebrating Christmas, watching the Dodgers play
at Ebbetts Field and hanging out with friends on the streetcorner.
   Backing King's reminiscences is a take from Mannheim
Steamroller's album ``A Fresh Aire Christmas.'' In addition, the
tape includes other music from the album, which has sold more than
1 million copies since its release last year.

   East Germany's Communist government today
published the draft of a new law allowing citizens 30 days a year
of free travel in the West after 19,000 East Germans joined the
westward stampede over the weekend.
   A Cabinet minister urged the Communist Party's ruling Politburo
to resign, and activists planned to stage another pro-democracy
rally in Leipzig tonight to maintain pressure on the government for
reforms.
   An opposition leader reacted coolly to the new travel proposal
and said authorities will need to do more to gain public trust.
   ``Travel is not the primary problem in East Germany,'' said
Sebastian Pflugbeil, a co-founder of New Forum, the largest
opposition group. ``Too many have left the country already.''
   ``The leadership must make other steps to prove it is earnest in
its reform efforts and to win the trust of the people,'' Pflugbeil
said in an interview with West Berlin's RIAS radio station.
   ``The tension between the people and the party has never been so
great as today,'' he said.
   In an apparent bid to discourage further exodus to West Germany,
where East Germans are automatically granted citizenship, the
government promised to ease restrictions on foreign travel before
the year is out.
   Announcing the decision, Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel said
on national television Sunday night: ``We want to give the
possibility to all citizens to travel wherever they want without
any restrictions.''
   All East German citizens would be allowed to travel freely
abroad up to 30 days a year, he said. The draft law will be
discussed publicly until Nov. 30 and will then go to Parliament. It
should take effect by year's end, he said.
   In addition, passport applications will be handled within 30
days with urgent cases settled in three days or less, Dickel said.
He indicated that illegal stays in the West would be decriminalized.
   Only direct violations of the border will be punished, Dickel
said, indicating this referred to escapes over the border with West
Germany or the Berlin Wall.
   Freedom of travel has been a major demand of East Germans who
have taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands over the
past month to protest decades of authoritarian rule.
   The only country East Germans can currently visit without exit
visas is neighboring communist Czechoslovakia, through which
thousands have poured since it opened its western frontier.
   About 1 million people took to the streets of East Berlin on
Saturday in the largest protest in the nation's 40-year history,
demanding free elections, freedom of speech and an end to the
Communist Party's ``leading role.''
   The state-run news agency ADN on Sunday quoted Culture Minister
Hans-Joachim Hoffmann as saying the ruling Politburo should resign
``to give the new general secretary a real chance.''
   ``We need as quickly as possible a new government,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The country's new leader, Egon Krenz, has promised major
reforms, including freer travel, in an effort to staunch the flood
of refugees that is sapping East Germany's labor force of skilled
young workers.
   Since August, more than 70,000 East Germans have fled to West
Germany through Hungary and via West Germany's embassies in Prague
and Warsaw.
   At least 19,000 more fled West after authorities announced
Friday that East Germans could travel to West Germany from
Czechoslovakia without any restrictions. The emigres were, however,
considered to be giving up their East Germany citizenship.
   On Sunday, thousands of young East German refugees rolled into
West Germany at the rate of more than 100 an hour, causing a
traffic jam that stretched several miles back into Czechoslovakia.
Today, more were arriving but at a slower pace.
   In his appeal for personnel shake-ups, Hoffmann also told a
crowd in Leipzig on Sunday that he thinks the 42-member Cabinet
should be streamlined.
   Krenz said Friday that five elderly Politburo members would step
down. Two other members of the 21-member Politburo were dismissed
when Krenz on Oct. 18 replaced longtime leader Erich Honecker, his
mentor.
   All those removed were closely associated with Honecker's
18-year rule as party chief.
   In other protests Sunday, about 10,000 demonstrated in Dresden
for action on environmental problems, and 10,000 protested for
reforms in Wilhelm-Pieck-Stadt Guben, ADN said.

<HEAD>Investigators: Value of Seized Cocaine Could Reach $1 Billion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators searched today for five suspects
in the city's largest drug seizure and continued to extract cocaine
from drums of a caustic powder that were found in a warehouse.
   The suspects may have fled because of news stories about the
Friday raid, which reporters learned about from a radio channel
used by law enforcement officials.
   Authorities focused their search on a man from Peru who heads
the company that rented the warehouse, his Colombian wife and three
others, The New York Times reported today.
   Mary Cooper, an agent and spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said the street value of the cocaine could reach $1
billion. About 8,800 pounds, or nearly 4{ tons, of cocaine were
removed from drums by Saturday.
   The work was suspended Sunday because the path of the New York
Marathon brought runners past the warehouse and fumes could have
been dangerous, Cooper said. Agents resumed their work today.
   The 8,800 pounds already extracted was estimated to have a
street value of more than $700 million, Cooper said.
   ``At this time, the seizure appears to be in the top five
nationwide,'' she said.
   The cocaine was wrapped in plastic bundles and put in drums that
contained powdered sodium hydroxide, which is the active ingredient
in lye.
   The raid was the latest in a series of large drug seizures in
the United States.
   On Sept. 29, 21.4 tons of cocaine were found in an unguarded
warehouse near Los Angeles. On Oct. 5, authorities discovered 9
tons of cocaine in a house in Harlingen, Texas, and about 6 tons on
a Panamanian ship in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The raid in Queens occurred after an anonymous tip to the
Brooklyn district attorney's office. Smugglers apparently believed
the cocaine, packed in plastic-wrapped bundles, would go
undiscovered because it was surrounded by sodium hydroxide, which
can burn the skin and damage lungs.
   The drugs were believed to belong to the Cali cartel, one of
Colombia's largest cocaine distributors.

   As thousands more East Germans
cross into the country and strain temporary shelters, West
Germany's leaders are urging Communist leaders in East Berlin to
move rapidly on fundamental reform.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, on
Sunday appealed to East Germans to stay home and push for change in
their own country.
   In an article for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Vogel said he
respected the decision of East Germans to emigrate to West Germany.
   ``But we are appealing to all those who are thinking of
emigrating to carefully examine whether they should not stay in
East Germany to support the process of democratization and to
engage themselves in that process,'' he wrote.
   Ernst Breit, head of the national Trade Union Federation,
cautioned the refugees not to entertain mistaken notions about life
in West Germany: ``We have to make it clear to them that West
Germany is not paradise.''
   Karl Heinz Horndasch, a spokesman for the federal border police
in Munich, said late Sunday that the number of temporary shelters
for the refugees had jumped from four on Friday to 25 nationwide.
   ``We are considering now whether we will have to open more,''
Horndasch said by telephone.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leading politicians called on
East Germany's new leader, Egon Krenz, to adopt reforms quickly to
stop the exodus.
   ``We hope that things will change so that people will not have
to leave their homeland to find happiness,'' Kohl said.
   East Germany today published the draft of a new law allowing
citizens 30 days a year of free travel in the West and speeding the
processing of passport applications. The law also would
decriminalize illegal stays in the West, although direct violations
of the border _ such as escaping over the Berlin Wall _ would be
punished, Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel said.
   Alfred Dregger, a parliamentary leader in Kohl's coalition
government, urged the East German leadership to allow free
elections.
   ``The Communist Party's monopoly on power is eroding,'' Dregger
said. ``The protest movement is a wild fire that Egon Krenz and the
Communist Party can only put out by free elections.''
   Thousands more East Germans flooded into West Germany through
Czechoslovakia after their government permitted its citizens, for
the first time, to cross to the West through that country with
nothing more than East German identification papers.
   The pace of the weekend exodus slowed today, but the tally of
East German arrivals since Saturday was 19,000 and still rising.
   Some Germans said East Germany's leaders had, figuratively,
opened a hole in the Berlin Wall with the new Czechoslovak escape
route.
   Driving their sputtering Trabants and Wartburgs filled with
stereos, luggage and children, the refugees needed to travel only
15 miles from the East German border to reach Bavaria in West
Germany.
   Many of the latest refugees went to temporary shelters.
   Horndasch, the police spokesman, said 12,500 refugees were in
military barracks, police training centers, a gymnasium, and other
temporary shelters. He said many were staying three to four days
before heading off to find housing and jobs.
   Some local police and relief workers wondered when the crush
would end.
   ``How long will they keep coming? That you have to ask Mr.
Krenz,'' said Uwe Luethje, a border police officer at the
Schirnding border crossing in northeastern Bavaria.
   At times Sunday, the refugees coming over the border at
Schirnding caused traffic jams backed up several several miles into
Czechoslovakia.
   Horndasch, the border policeman in Munich, said about 1,400 more
refugees were expected later in the day on trains from Prague, the
Czechoslovak capital.
   ``The people will keep fleeing as long as they can,'' said
Christian Schreiber, a 23-year dental technician from Staaken
outside East Berlin.
   In addition to the East Germans arriving at Schirnding and
Waidhaus, 10 trains carrying refugees from Prague also crossed into
Marktredwitz.

   Supporters of Christian leader Gen.
Michel Aoun today roughed up Lebanon's Maronite Catholic partriarch
and forced him to kiss a picture of Aoun for supporting a peace
plan the general opposes, police said.
   About 100 young Aoun supporters stormed the compound of
patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir in Bkirki, north of Beirut, shortly after
midnight and ransacked it, police said. Aoun's supporters also
rallied in the streets of east Beirut and other Christian areas.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said other Aoun loyalists stormed at least six other
churches in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave early today,
firing automatic rifles in the air and burning tires.
   The assaults came a day after Parliament elected a Maronite
Catholic president as part of an Arab League-sponsored plan
designed to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Sfeir, the spiritual leader of the Maronites, Lebanon's main
Christian sect, supported the parliamentarians against Aoun.
   Sfeir's office alleged that a 40-man army unit of Aoun's troops
assigned to protect the patriarch did not try to stop the
protesters as they charged the compound in the hills above Beirut.
   ``The rioters broke into the patriarch's bedroom, dragged him
out of bed, forced him to kneel with two senior aides ... and
forced them all to kiss posters of Aoun,'' a police spokesman said.
   Sfeir, 68, fled after the one-hour assault to his summer
residence in Diman in Syrian-controlled north Lebanon, his office
said in a statement.
   The unrest flared hours after parliamentary deputies, forced out
of Beirut after Aoun threatened to shell them, convened at the
Kleiat airbase in north Lebanon and elected Maronite deputy Rene
Mouawad president to head a national reconciliation government.
   Mouawad, 64, is Lebanon's ninth president since independence
from France in 1943. Aoun has been living in the presidential
palace and refused to give it up to Mouawad.
   On Saturday, Aoun declared Parliament dissolved in a bid to stop
it from meeting to elect the president and ratify the peace plan.
He rejected the plan because it did not set a deadline for the
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   Legislators moved their session to the base, beyond the range of
Aoun's artillery.
   In a speech after his election, Mouawad, a 32-year
parliamentarian, called the peace plan, approved last month in
Saudi Arabia, an introduction to ``a new Lebanese republic.'' He
promised to quickly appoint a Cabinet that would ``patch up broken
ties and reunite what had been fractured.''
   The accord increased Parliament's seats from 99 to 108,
distributed equally between Christians and Moslems, and curtailed
presidential powers to give the prime minister and parliament
speaker, both traditionally Moslems, a larger share in the
decision-making process.
   The police spokesman said Sfeir urged rioters to leave his
compound, ``but they were hysterical.''
   Some protesters broke through into the small church in the
compound ``and desecrated it by smashing benches and throwing sand
and rocks on the carpets and paintings,'' the spokesman said.
   He said Aoun's loyalists tore pictures of the patriarch and Pope
John Paul II from the walls and replaced them with posters of Aoun,
who is also a Maronite.
   In east Beirut and other Christian areas, Aoun supporters
blocked key intersections with rocks and blazing tires and chanted,
``Mouawad will not be allowed into the liberated (Christian) area!''
   One group drove around Beirut's Christian sector in a convoy of
about 50 cars, firing automatic rifles in the air, honking horns
and shouting: ``There is no leader but Aoun! Mouawad is a Syrian
lackey!''
   Schools, shops, restaurants, banks, government offices and other
businesses closed throughout the Christian enclave in a general
strike to protest the election.
   In a statement broadcast by Radio Lebanon, which is controlled
by Aoun, the general told his supporters to ``limit your protests
to civilized and peaceful methods.''
   He remained in the bunker of the hilltop presidential palace in
suburban Baabda, east of Beirut, unwilling to surrender the
shell-wrecked building to Mouawad.
   Asked whether the general would turn over the palace to the new
president, an Aoun aide snapped: ``You must be kidding.''
   ``The general does not recognize the election. How would he turn
over the palace, the symbol of legitimacy, to someone whom he
doesn't recognize as the legitimate president?'' said the aide, who
refused to be named.
   Mouawad, who spent the night at his family mansion in the
northern mountain resort of Ehden, drove to nearby Diman around
noon to ``pay his respects'' to patriarch Sfeir, his press office
said.
   Men performed folk dances and women sprayed Mouawad with rose
water and rice in a traditional gesture of greeting.
   ``The presidency is yours! Mouawad is a hero!'' they chanted.
   Salim Hoss, who headed a Moslem Cabinet that has vyed for power
with Aoun's Christian government for 14 months, also drove to Diman
to meet Mouawad and Sfeir.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, announced his resignation a few minutes
after Mouawad was elected Sunday.
   Lebanon has not held parliamentary elections since 1972 and it
had been without a president since September 1988, when President
Amin Gemayel's six-year term expired and Parliament was unable to
decide on a successor.

   More than 300 former USS Lexington crew
members gathered on the aircraft carrier to mark the 45th
anniversary of a kamikaze strike that killed 47 sailors.
   They also remembered five people who died a week ago when a
training jet crashed into the ship.
   During shipboard services Sunday, Capt. C. Flack Logan told the
former crew members their presence was a good influence on training
carrier's young crew as it mourns the deaths from the Oct. 29 crash.
   ``You represented the best when you went to war and you won. You
started a tradition of excellence on the Lexington,'' Logan said.
``You've shown us the way to prepare, to train, to drill, and to be
ready for the unexpected.''
   The veterans had planned the reunion to coincide with Sunday's
anniversary of the Japanese suicide attack during World War II.
   A week before the anniversary, a T-2 Buckeye training jet
crashed into the Lexington, killing the student pilot and four
people on the deck.
   ``This has been a very trying week for all of us,'' said the
ship's chaplain, Jerry Seely.
   The Blue Ghost Association of Lexington veterans organized the
reunion. During the war, Japanese propagandist Tokyo Rose gave the
ship the nickname ``Blue Ghost'' because she reported it sunk
several times, only to have it reappear in its unusual,
uncamouflaged blue-gray paint.
   The ship now is used solely to train naval aviators.
   During a day cruise Saturday, sailors from two eras dropped a
pair of wreaths into the Gulf of Mexico about 10 miles from where
the trainer crash occurred.
   Pointing to a radar dome at the rear of the ship's
superstructure, Roland King of Westfield, Mass., president of the
veterans' association, said, ``We got a kamikaze strike just behind
that thing on the starboard side.
   ``That one (the trainer) hit on the port side, just the opposite
side,'' King said. ``It's just a narrow place. It's ironic that
they both struck at the same place.''
   A couple of bent railings and scuff marks on the deck were about
the only remaining signs of the crash.
   About 1,500 guests, including family members of the 1,400
current crew members, crowded onto the ship's flight deck to watch
demonstration flights by various Navy aircraft and a fly-over by
five T-2s.
   One of the training jets peeled off to leave the other four in a
missing-man formation. Logan and King then dropped the wreaths
overboard.

<HEAD>Yugoslav Freighter Seized on Order From Prosecutor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Yugoslav freighter that destroyed part of a coral
reef when it ran aground in the Florida Keys has been seized at the
order of a federal prosecutor, who plans to seek $3 million in
damages against its owner.
   The 475-foot Mavro Vetranick arrived Saturday at the Port of
Miami after 66 hours swinging back and forth on the reef about 65
miles west of Key West.
   The vessel, which carried a cargo of phosphate and 390 tons of
fuel, destroyed between two and three acres of living coral,
environmental officials said.
   The ship was seized Sunday by U.S. marshals.
   ``Marshals went out, put a sticker on the ship and moved it to a
U.S. Customs dock,'' said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   A federal lawsuit was to be filed asking about $3 million in
damages, Cossin said. The ship and its cargo have been valued at $9

   ``We've ordered the seizure of this asset because it assures us
that the claim we are alleging will be satisfied,'' Cossin said.
   Members of the ship's 26-man crew were subpoenaed to appear
Tuesday at the opening of a Coast Guard board of inquiry to
determine why the ship ran aground Oct. 31.
   Karl Mueller, an agent for the ship's owner, Atlantska Plovidba
in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, said company officials weren't happy to
hear the freighter had been seized.
   ``They were upset. Naturally, everybody's upset. The ship costs
money. Lying idle, the ship costs money,'' Mueller said.

   The Treasury Department postponed its
scheduled weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills today
because of Congress' failure to raise the debt limit.
   It was uncertain whether the Treasury would be able to go ahead
with its planned quarterly refunding later this week.
   It tentatively had scheduled to auction $10 billion in
three-year notes on Tuesday, $10 billion in 10-year notes on
Wednesday and $10 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday.
   In addition, Treasury planned to sell $10 billion in 36-day cash
management bills on Thursday.
   The government's borrowing authority dropped from $2.87 trillion
to $2.80 trillion last Tuesday.
   The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion
for the current fiscal year, but Senate legislation has been
blocked by a squabble over whether to cut the capital gains tax.

<HEAD>Vivian Mercier, Irish Academic and Literary Critic, Dies at 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vivian Mercier, an Irish literary critic and
academic whose published works included a major study on the work
of Samuel Beckett, has died at age 70.
   Mercier, who taught at New York University, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and the University of California at Santa
Barbara, died Saturday in London, The Irish Times reported today.
   The cause of death was not announced.
   Mercier's published works included ``The Irish Comic
Tradition,'' ``A Reader's Guide to the French New Novel'' and
``Samuel Beckett.'' The last book was done with the cooperation of
the reclusive author, an Irishman who has long lived in France.
   Mercier was also co-editor of an anthology, ``A Thousand Years
of Irish Prose,'' and was at work on a ``A New Critical History of
Anglo-Irish Literature.''
   Conor Cruise O'Brien, the writer and former politician who was
Mercier's roommate at Trinity College, wrote in The Irish Times of
meeting Mercier two weeks before his death.
   ``His conversation was as animated, his mind as penetrating and
as idiosyncratic as ever; even more remarkable, and more
characteristic, was how annoying he could be, there on his hospital
bed,'' O'Brien wrote.
   ``I never met Vivian, at any time, during our long years of
friendship without his saying something _ never more than one thing
_ which was calculated to annoy. And I mean calculated. This may
not seem an endearing characteristic, but in fact it was; it was a
sort of spice, preserving our friendship.''
   Mercier is survived by his wife, the novelist Eilis Dillon, and
three children from his first marriage. A funeral service was
scheduled Wednesday at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, followed
by burial in his native Clara in County Offaly.

   Burma's first multi-party elections in
nearly three decades will be held May 27, 1990, Election Commission
sources said today.
   The independent five-member commission met with the governing
State Law and Order Restoration Council today to discuss the
nationwide balloting.
   Polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.
   It will be the first general election involving more than one
party since 1960.
   The military seized power in 1962 and held general elections
under a one-party system in 1974, 1978, 1981 and 1985.
   The military, under armed forces chief Gen. Saw Maung, overthrew
the socialist regime on Sept. 18, 1988, following nationwide
demonstrations for democracy. The military then dissolved the
one-party system and promised general elections without military
participation.
   More than 200 parties have registered to take part in the
elections.

   Voters in Washington state and Michigan may increase education
taxes, quake-weary San Franciscans may finance a new stadium to
keep their pennant-winning baseball team from fleeing, and Texans
may spare politicians from having to swear they didn't bribe their
way into office.
   In all, voters in 10 states will face 56 statewide issues and
dozens of local ballot measures Tuesday.
   Texas voters tackle the heaviest load: 21 statewide
propositions, including a $500 million bond issue to extend running
water and sewers to disease-ridden border towns, another to finance
a record build-up of the state's prison system, and one to drop a
113-year-old provision requiring state officeholders to publicly
affirm that they gained their jobs honestly.
   Among other key contests, Maine voters will consider a
non-binding measure asking if they want to ban cruise missile
testing within their state and a second asking whether they approve
of an agreement to dispose of Maine's nuclear waste at a facility
in Beatty, Nev.
   Locally, San Franciscans will decide whether to build a new $115
million ballpark to replace aging, windswept Candlestick Park and
keep the baseball Giants from leaving town. The measure is strongly
backed by Mayor Art Agnos, but polls suggest the
multibillion-dollar expenses from the recent earthquake have eroded
support.
   A second San Francisco ballot measure would allow unmarried
couples, including homosexuals, to formally establish their
relationships as ``domestic partners.'' Registered partners working
for the city would be entitled to the same funeral leave benefits
as married people, if their partner dies.
   A large turnout is expected in nearby Concord, Calif., where an
ordinance banning discrimination in housing, employment and other
areas against AIDS victims was approved by the City Council but
placed on the ballot after protests by outraged residents who
collected 10,000 signatures.
   Seattle residents will decide a measure that would end forced
school busing and promote educational choice.
   In St. Louis, voters will consider a 4-cent property tax
increase to subsidize the St. Louis Symphony. Symphony officials
said the orchestra has gone as far as it can in raising money from
the wealthy and raising ticket prices. But critics in the Missouri
Legislature have called the symphony elitist.
   Voters in New York City, under U.S. Supreme Court order to
replace its legislative system with a more representative one, will
weigh a complicated charter revision that would strengthen the
mayor and the City Council, while scrapping the 89-year-old Board
of Estimate. The measure is expected to pass easily.
   In Texas, there has been little opposition to Proposition 2,
which would authorize $500 million in bonds for basic water and
sewer systems in the substandard border subdivisions called
colonias. An estimated 200,000 people live in colonias, where
sewage runs in irrigation ditches and dysentery, hepatitis and
tuberculosis are common.
   ``It's sometimes very easy for us who have running water to just
open the tap and get it, and we forget about others who don't,''
said Amalia Lerma of Valley Interfaith, one of the groups backing
the bond issue.
   The package also includes $400 million for water supply, water
quality and flood control projects around the state.
   Texans also will decide whether to approve $400 million in
tax-backed bonds for the biggest prison buildup in state history,
along with new mental health institutions, juvenile corrections
facilities and law enforcement.
   Texas Proposition 13 would enshrine a ``victims bill of rights''
in the state constitution, giving victims the ability to confer
with the prosecutor, receive restitution and get information about
an accused's conviction, sentence, imprisonment and release.
   Another Texas measure would eliminate the oath now taken by
elected officials and others who must swear _ often during public
ceremonies in front of family and friends _ that they didn't bribe
anyone to get their jobs.
   The provision was added to the Texas constitution in reaction to
corruption during the Reconstruction Era. But some now feel the
oath is outdated and undignified.
   In Washington state, Initiative 102, called the ``Children's
Initiative,'' would boost the state's 6.5-cent sales tax by nearly
a penny to provide at least $360 million for social and education
programs.
   Big business led by Boeing Co. recently created a stir by
contributing about $50,000 to opponents of the initiative, who
include Republican conservatives. Opponents brand the initiative a
disguised teacher raise.
   Backers, mainly teacher and public employee groups and social
service organizations, say the unmet needs of children are
staggering. They range from more child protective caseworkers to
handle a growing number of kids taken from crack-addicted parents,
to an overwhelmed system for the developmentally disabled, to
overcrowded classrooms as parts of Washington experiences a surge
in growth.
   In Michigan, voters will consider two ballot proposals, each of
which would raise the state sales tax to provide more money for
schools.
   Proposal A, backed by Gov. James Blanchard, teacher
organizations and major corporations, would increase the sales tax
to 4.5 percent from 4 percent to generate $400 million more for
schools.
   Proposal B, with no organized backing and a tiny budget, would
raise the sales tax to 6 percent, cut property taxes some $1.5
billion and put about $350 million more into schools.
   ``Proposal A has money and B doesn't,'' said state Sen. Dan
DeGrow, a Proposal B backer. ``But they both face an uphill fight.''
   Both, or neither, could pass. If both garner majorities, the one
with the larger one would prevail.
   The Michigan State Chamber of Commerce wants voters to reject
both.
   ``The further we get away from the Capitol, the better the
reception,'' said chamber vice president Richard Studley.
   David Rohde, a political science professor at Michigan State
University, said: ``There is indeed a lot of cynicism, at least
about anything that involves spending money and increasing taxes to
spend money. It's not impossible, but any tax increase has a tough
row to hoe.''

<HEAD>Dissidents' Trial Adjourned; Protesters Demand His Release</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRATISLAVA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 people rallied
outside the Palace of Justice today to demand freedom for one of
Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissidents, who faces up to 10
years in jail on sedition charges.
   The trial of Jan Carnogursky was adjourned today because his
defense attorney, Tibor Boehm, was ill. The rally began shortly
afterward, when Carnogursky's 18-year-old son read to his father's
supporters a letter the attorney wrote to the court.
   Boehm wrote that the only crime committed by Carnogursky and
four co-defendants was to speak the truth. He urged the court to
free all five in the name of democracy.
   ``The defendents only tried to make people think and speak
openly, to arouse them from indifference,'' Boehm wrote.
   ``Truth and justice can be deformed, but they cannot be
suppressed forever,'' he said.
   The trial of Carnogursky, a Roman Catholic activist and human
rights campaigner, epitomizes a crackdown on dissent that is out of
step with the reforms in most other Soviet bloc nations. It has
drawn widespread protest.
   Carnogursky is charged with sedition and subversion for writing
one article for an underground monthly in Bratislava, capital of
the republic of Slovakia, and for signing a statement with four
other activists in August.
   Those four who were detained with Carnogursky on Aug. 14 face up
to five years in jail. Their trial is to begin next week.
   Police have cracked down hard on mass demostrations for
democracy in Czechoslovakia over the past two years, but security
men watching today's gathering filmed it but did not interfere.
   In court, Carnogursky, a trained lawyer who was barred from
practice after signing the Charter 77 human rights document,
refused to allow a substitute defense lawyer to take Boehm's place.
   Judge Stefan Cakvari granted adjournment. Carnogursky then asked
to be freed pending trial.
   No date was set for a new trial and no ruling was reached on the
request, which drew cheers from the crowd outside.
   ``Long Live Carnogursky!'' the crowd chanted. They also broke
into chants of ``Freedom! Freedom!,'' and ``Long Live Charter 77!''
   Several church and Charter 77 activists were admitted to the
courtroom, as were Western correspondents and diplomats.
   Carnogursky asked that his case be considered together with that
of fellow activist Miroslav Kusy, one of the four to be tried next
week.
   All five people were detained after signing an appeal in August
urging people to mark the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Warsaw Pact
invasion by laying flowers in memory of people who died in the
invasion. The Soviet-led assault crushed a reform movement in
Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Jerome Robbins to Resign from City Ballet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerome Robbins, regarded as one of the century's
finest choreographers, said he will resign as co-director of the
New York City Ballet on Jan. 1.
   Robbins, 71, plans to continue writing his memoirs and to
develop an autobiographical theater piece. The ballet company
announced his resignation Sunday.
   ``It's important at my age to do other things,'' he said. ``I'm
resigning from the New York City Ballet; I'm not retiring from the
field.''
   Though he's stepping down as co-director, Robbins is due soon to
begin rehearsals at the City Ballet for a retrospective of his
ballets since 1944. The Robbins festival is scheduled to be
presented next spring.
   The choreographer, who has worked with the City Ballet since
1949, has spent most of the past year working on ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' a medley of excerpts from musicals he choreographed or
directed.
   His ballets include ``Fancy Free'' and ``The Guests,'' while his
Broadway work includes such shows as ``West Side Story,'' ``Fiddler
on the Roof'' and ``Peter Pan.''
   Peter Martins, the City Ballet's other co-director, will be
solely responsible for the company's artistic policy after Robbins'
resignation becomes effective.
   Robbins said he also is considering working in Europe on stage
ballets or operas, but ruled out the possibility of directing any
other company.

<HEAD>EDS: Leads with 8 grafs to UPDATE with miners saying they will continue

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet coal minister met with striking miners
in the Soviet Arctic today but failed to persuade them to end their
illegal walkout, which officials say threatens winter fuel supplies.
   Mikhail I. Shchadov met for three hours with strikers from 11
mines in the Pechora Basin but did not adequately assure them their
working, social and living conditions would improve, said Alexander
Petrovsky, who attended the session.
   Miners were promised improved living and working conditions in
July after a nationwide strike.
   Workers in the largest mine of the Pechora Basin struck Oct. 25
to protest government delays in fulfilling the promises.
   They were joined last week by miners at 10 other shafts, and now
only two mines in the region are working, with more than 15,000
miners reported on strike.
   Shchadov told miners that part of the July decree pledging the
improvements was being implemented on schedule and that the rest
was awaiting action by the Supreme Soviet legislature, according to
Petrovsky, who spoke in a telephone interview.
   Petrovsky and strike committee member Nikolai A. Teryokhin, who
was interviewed in Moscow, said miners were not satisfied with
Shchadov's report and would continue the walkout.
   On Sunday, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said the situation in the
coal industry ``creates an inadmissible situation in ensuring vital
supplies for our people, for the work of basic and other sectors of
the national economy.''
   Ryzhkov, in remarks distributed by the official Tass news
agency, asked the strikers to show ``reason and a sense of civic
duty.''
   The strike violates a law passed by the Soviet legislature last
month banning walkouts in such vital sectors as energy and defense.
A local court has ruled the strike illegal but has not moved to
halt it.
   Government officials are scheduled to meet with miners Nov. 17
to review how well the government has kept its promises.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee
today began preparing its program for an upcoming nationwide
congress that aims to revamp the party and revive its flagging
fortunes.
   During the course of a daylong plenum, the committee planned to
debate ideological changes, the preliminary program and the party's
position on the economic program of the new Solidarity-led
government.
   ``We are meeting in an atmosphere shaped by unfavorable social
moods. Thus, the bigger are party expectations for a bold
programmatic offer,'' the official news agency PAP quoted party
leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as telling the meeting.
   Continuing a practice started earlier this fall, the party
briefly allowed reporters in for the opening of the session before
closing the plenum for debate.
   The future course of the party became a key issue after the
Polish Communist Party became the first in the East bloc to lose
control of the government with the Aug. 24 election of Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   In an interview with the party daily Trybuna Ludu, Politburo
member Leszek Miller said the most important issues ``are the
questions not about what we want to achieve, but how we want to do
it.''
   An internal survey of the party conducted in September indicated
that 72 percent of the members favored a complete retooling of the
party, starting with its name.
   The Central Committee also planned to discuss procedures for the
election of delegates to the party congress that are supposed to be
held under new democratic rules.
   It was decided at a plenum Oct. 3 that the election of the
delegates should occur by Dec. 20.
   Top party members have said the party will transform itself into
a broad party of leftist and social democratic forces at the
congress in January.
   A party official who refused to be named said one of the most
important issues at the plenum would be discussion of the party's
position on the Mazowiecki government's economic reform program,
which aims to introduce a market-style economy.
   ``In the conditions of the market economy, the realization of
the principles of justice as well as other leftist values is
especially difficult ... There are no ready recipes,'' Miller said
in the newspaper interview.

<TEXT>
   A woman who says she is Hank Williams Sr.'s
daughter lost a Supreme Court bid today for a share of the late
country music legend's copyright royalties.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Cathy Yvonne
Stone waited too long before suing over the royalties.
   Ms. Stone, 36, was born in Alabama five days after Williams died
Jan. 1, 1953, at age 29.
   Her mother, Bobbie Jett, and Williams signed an agreement a few
months earlier in which he acknowledged he might be the father of
the then-unborn child.
   The girl first was adopted by Lillian Stone, Williams' mother.
After Mrs. Stone died, the child was adopted by George and Mary
Deupree. The Deuprees in 1967 refused to be included in court
proceedings to determine whether Williams had fathered any children
other than Hank Williams Jr., now a country music star.
   Mrs. Deupree first told her adopted daughter in 1973 that the
elder Williams may have been her natural father. But Ms. Stone did
not take any immediate legal action to establish her real parentage.
   Ms. Stone waited until 1985, soon after marrying attorney Keith
Adkinson, to file federal and state court lawsuits seeking a share
of Williams' songwriting royalties.
   State courts in Alabama ruled she was Williams' daughter but not
his legal heir.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit of Appeals, based in New York City, threw
out her claim for the royalties last April.
   The appeals court, which presumed that Williams was Ms. Stone's
father, said there may have been good reason for her not to sue
soon after learning the apparent truth.
   Her delay at least until 1980 may be explained by loyalty to the
Deuprees or out of fear of the notoriety a suit would generate, the
appeals court said. But it added, ``There is simply no plausible
explanation for delay in filing the complaint until September 1985.
Ms. Stone's procrastination and delay, which silently allowed time
to slip away, remain as the only reason for her failure to bring
suit earlier.''
   The appeals court said permitting a suit after so many years
would be unfair to the other copyright owners, including Hank
Williams Jr.
   The case is Stone vs. Williams, 89-295.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees To Decide Mormon Tax Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether money given directly to Mormon missionaries by church
members is a deductible donation under federal tax law.
   The justices voted to hear the appeal of a Mormon couple from
Idaho who were denied tax deductions for subsidizing their two
sons' missionary service.
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 6.7 million
members and about 35,000 fulltime missionaries through the world.
Nearly all are supported by relatives or other church members.
   The high court's decision, expected by July, will resolve
conflicting federal appeals court rulings that allow such
deductions in six states and ban them in nine states.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ruled that the
Internal Revenue Service correctly refused to treat the donations
made by Harold and Enid Davis of Idaho Falls as tax-deductible
charitable contributions.
   Such direct donations are not deductible because the Mormon
Church does not exercise sufficient control over how the money is
spent, the San Francisco-based appeals court said.
   Its ruling set a binding precedent for nine Western states:
Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, California, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, Oregon
and Washington.
   About 1.6 million Mormons live in the states encompassed by the
9th Circuit.
   The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals explicitly
rejected the ``control'' requirement adopted by the 9th Circuit
court.
   In a ruling that set a binding precedent for Colorado, Kansas,
New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, the 10th Circuit court said
such direct donations to missionaries are tax-deductible because
their primary purpose is to further the church's aims.
   The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that such donations by residents of Louisiana, Mississippi and
Texas may be tax-deductible if the amounts paid match a specific
request from the church for those amounts.
   At issue is that part of the federal tax code defining a
deductible contribution to charity as ``a contribution or gift to
or for the use of'' a qualifying organization.
   Bush administration lawyers, although contending that the 9th
Circuit's interpretation of federal tax law is the correct one,
asked the justices to grant review to the Davises' appeal.
   Noting the thousands of missionaries supported by individuals,
government lawyers said, ``The issue presented in this case will
govern the tax liability of many United States taxpayers.''
   They added, ``The general issue ... has ramifications beyond the
specific context of the church's missionary program.''
   The church asks a missionary's family to contribute the
necessary financing. If a family is unwilling or unable to
contribute the necessary funds, the church seeks direct donations
to the missionaries from other church members in the same community.
   The Davises spent about $7,600 subsidizing their son Benjamin's
missionary work in New York City in 1980-81, and about $1,500 for
their son Cecil's missionary work in New Zealand in 1981.
   The subsidies for neither son exceeded amounts set by the church.
   The Davises made the deduction claims belatedly, unsuccessfully
seeking refunds of $1,779.71 and $2,613.10, respectively, for the
two years.
   The case is Davis vs. U.S., 89-98.

described as one of Africa's richest men, lost a Supreme Court bid
today to shield himself from a potentially costly divorce lawsuit
in Connecticut.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling that
diplomatic immunity does not protect Ambassador Antonio Deinde
Fernandez from being sued by his estranged wife.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case,
but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Connecticut courts placed an $8 million lien on Fernandez's
property pending the outcome of the divorce case.
   The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled last September that Barbara
Fernandez should have her day in court to determine whether she is
entitled to the family home in Greenwich, Conn.
   The state court said the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations does not give the ambassador immunity in the divorce case
because the government of Mozambique issued a waiver permitting the
Connecticut courts to dissolve the marriage.
   The state court said it did not have to decide whether Mrs.
Fernandez would be entitled to sue for a property award even if
there were no waiver.
   The Vienna treaty allows Mrs. Fernandez's ``claim for ownership
of the family residence to be heard in this case,'' the state court
said. ``It is for the trial court to determine whether to grant
(her) title to the disputed real property.''
   But the state court said Connecticut courts lack authority to
award Mrs. Fernandez any support payments.
   Mrs. Fernandez said her husband has a net worth of more than $75
million and ``has admitted to being one of the richest men in
Africa.''
   The couple married in Arlington, Va., in 1961 and were separated
in early 1985.
   In his Supreme Court appeal, Fernandez said the divorce suit
also infringes on his diplomatic immunity by examining his private
life.
   The trial judge will hear evidence about his health, his
finances and the reasons for the divorce, Fernandez said.
   This will ``require the deepest intrusion into the ambassador's
most personal affairs _ factors that would directly challenge the
prestige and dignity of the diplomat,'' his lawyers said.
   Asked for their views, Justice Department lawyers said the court
should reject Fernandez's appeal.
   The case is Fernandez vs. Fernandez, 88-1042.

<HEAD>Neither Side Willing to Budge in Boeing Strike</HEAD>

   Neither side is willing to budge in the
Machinists strike against the Boeing Co., which vowed not to make
any new contract offers after union negotiators rejected its latest
proposal.
   ``They have our best proposal. This is our final offer,'' Larry
McKean, chief Boeing negotiator, said Sunday.
   ``Then they won't get any planes,'' countered Tom Baker,
president of Machinists District Lodge 751. ``Boeing will find that
our members are angry and determined not to be insulted and
degraded by takeaways and phony number games.''
   After six days of meetings with a federal mediator, talks
collapsed Saturday when union negotiators rejected the last company
offer. The strike began Oct. 4.
   Talks were not expected to resume anytime soon.
   ``Both sides need some time to make some pretty hard
decisions,'' mediator Doug Hammond said. ``If they came back in the
moods they're in now, they won't get anything done except to snipe
at each other.''
   McKean said the new contained improvements in lump sum payments,
overtime and retirement benefits, but it had no more money than a
proposed three-year pact rejected by the union Oct. 3.
   Baker said the union had no intention of putting the latest
offer before its members because it would be rejected and ``putting
it to a vote would only mean more anger.''
   The Machinists represent about 57,800 workers, including 43,300
in the local district lodge, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in
Portland, Ore., and a few hundred at scattered sites in other
states.
   McKean said an average 10 percent of those represented by the
Machinists are crossing picket lines nationally, ranging from 4
percent in the Puget Sound area, where union membership is
mandatory, to 34 percent in Wichita, where membership is voluntary
under state law.
   Union leaders have maintained the figures are far lower.

<HEAD>Court Declines to Hear Alabama, Nevada Cases on Punitive Damages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today passed up a chance to
decide whether huge punitive-damage awards in personal-injury
lawsuits may be unconstitutional.
   The court, with one dissenting vote, rejected appeals in two
cases from Alabama and one from Nevada that raised the issue.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in all three
cases, but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   The justices last June ruled, by a 7-2 vote, that such
multimillion-dollar awards do not violate the Constitution's ban on
excessive fines. But the decision left open the possibility that
the awards may so exceed actual damages that they violate
due-process rights.
   The clause says states may not deprive anyone of property
without due process of law. Those wishing to limit punitive-damage
awards say due process should prohibit unlimited jury discretion in
civil cases.
   Left undisturbed were a $6 million judgment an insurance company
was ordered to pay a Nevada stroke victim, a $2.75 million award to
an Alabama woman whose teen-age daughter was killed in a car crash
and a $500,000 award to an Alabama couple who bought a defective
mobile home.
   In the Nevada case, Combined Insurance Co. of America had been
ordered to pay $200,000 in compensatory benefits and $5.9 million
in punitive damages to Thomas Ainsworth of Sparks.
   Ainsworth suffered a stroke in 1982 while undergoing an
angiogram, in which dye is injected into the blood vessels to find
out if they are blocked. Ainsworth had suffered from occasional
dizzy spells.
   The insurance company was sued because it refused to pay a claim
for $9,600 on grounds the stroke was caused by a disease _ the
build-up of plaque in the arteries. Ainsworth's policy covered
accidents but not diseases.
   A jury decided the stroke was the result of an accident, and the
insurance company's refusal to pay caused Ainsworth and his wife
cruel and unjust hardship.
   One of the Alabama cases stemmed from an 80-mile-per-hour drag
race between Thomas Eugene Clardy and James K. Kervin in Montgomery
in the early-morning hours of Aug. 30, 1986.
   Clardy, attempting to pass Kervin, swung his truck into the
opposite lane and crashed head-on with Norma Hoffmann, 16. Clardy,
who was drunk, and Ms. Hoffmann were killed.
   The girl's mother, Martha Hoffmann Sanders, sued Kervin and the
estate of Clardy, who owned a real estate company. A jury awarded
her $2.75 million in punitive damages.
   Clardy's widow, Debby, appealed.
   In the other Alabama case, Wayne and Carolyn Jaye bought a
Vintage Enterprises mobile home in 1985 from a dealer in Opelika,
Ala. The vehicle was made at a Vintage plant in Georgia.
   The Jayes said there were various problems with the mobile home,
including a ceiling that needed to be replaced. The couple said
some defects were remedied but other attempted repairs were
inadequate.
   A jury in Alabama awarded the Jayes $20,000 in compensatory
damages and $500,000 to punish the manufacturer.
   Vintage Enterprises said the award forced it into bankruptcy and
to shut down a plant in Henderson, N.C., where 150 people were
employed.
   Business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and
consumer groups over the legitimacy of huge judgments in civil
cases.
   Those who oppose the big-money awards say they squelch American
competitiveness and development of new products, particularly new
forms of medical treatment.
   Consumer activists say punitive damages are a powerful deterrent
to corporate greed, which poses a threat to public safety and
well-being. They say smaller compensatory awards may be viewed by
larger corporations as an acceptable cost of doing business.
   Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates,
recently have put caps on how much money can be recovered in
personal-injury cases. No such law was at issue in the cases acted
on today.
   The cases are Combined Insurance Co. vs. Ainsworth, 89-282;
Clardy vs. Sanders, 89-440; and Vintage Enterprises vs. Jaye,
89-456.

<HEAD>Court Allows Officials to Put Price Ceilings on Texas Natural Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed federal
officials to place price ceilings on natural gas recovered from a
vast underground reservoir in the Texas Panhandle.
   The court, without comment, rejected appeals by Texas state
officials and gas producers who challenged orders of the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.
   At issue were gas reserves under a panhandle area 124 miles long
and 20 miles wide.
   The commission in 1984 identified 37 oil well operators it said
were interfering with the interstate sale of gas found under the
same land as the oil wells.
   Because of the underground formations in the Panhandle, oil well
operators often must drill through gas-bearing rock to reach the
lower-lying oil deposits.
   The commission said the oil well operators were taking gas
intended for interstate sales and selling it within Texas for
higher prices.
   The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 permits some hard-to-produce
gas to be sold at higher prices to encourage gas production. The
law requires gas previously committed to interstate commerce to be
sold at lower prices.
   The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates gas production in
the state, joined the oil well operators in claiming the federal
agency exceeded its authority and mistakenly classifed the
Panhandle gas.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in April upheld the
federal commission's orders, saying it found ``overwhelming support
for the reasonableness'' of the agency's decisions.
   Bush administration lawyers urged the justices to leave the
appeals court ruling undisturbed.
   The cases are Railroad Commission vs. FERC, 89-196, and Walker
Operating Corp. vs. FERC, 89-394.

   Afghan rebels today claimed they
killed 15 government soldiers and wounded 11 others, including the
son of a provincial governor, in an attack on the airport of the
southeastern city of Kandahar.
   The insurgents killed an Afghan Army general during a separate
attack on the airport.
   Official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said Gen. Ali
Akbar, the commander at Kandahar, was buried Sunday in Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
   ``He was killed during face-to-face fighting with extremists,''
the radio said, referring to the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   MIDIA, a news agency of Afghan rebels based in Pakistan,
reported that guerrillas began a series of rocket attacks on the
Kandahar airport on Oct. 29, wounding two Afghan generals. One of
the generals wounded was Akbar, who later died.
   It identified the other wounded general only as Gen. Halim,
military police chief of the province. It said the Kandahar chief
of military intelligence, identified as Gen. Shamshuddin, also was
wounded nearby by a mine planted by rebels.
   MIDIA today reported 15 more soldiers killed in another attack
on the airport Friday. It said the wounded included the son of the
provincial governor, Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi.
   On Sunday, the agency reported that 11 officers and 18 enlisted
men were killed when rebels attacked the large Shindand air base in
western Farah province.
   It did not say when the attack occurred or give details.
   The guerrillas, backed mainly by the United States and Pakistan,
are fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government in Kabul and
replace it with an Islamic government.
   Soviet forces ended nine years of involvement in the civil war
in February, but the guerrillas have yet to conquer a major Afghan
city.

nominated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republicans are bracing for a fierce fight
over the nomination of black conservative Clarence Thomas as an
appeals court judge, saying it could rekindle the so-called judges
war that raged in the Reagan era.
   ``If they try to do to Clarence Thomas what they did to Bill
Lucas and Bob Bork and you might as well throw in John Tower, then
it's going to be all-out, bloody war,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
said after the nomination arrived in the Senate last week.
   Democratic senators are treading warily.
   ``I am one of those who has spoken out for more minority
representation on the courts, but I don't want ideologues,'' says
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who, like Hatch, is on the Senate
Judiciary Committee that will consider Thomas' nomination. ``Will
he apply the law or will he apply his philosophy?''
   Civil rights forces thus far have been holding their fire, but
for months they have been building a thick dossier on Thomas and
clearly are weighing an intensive fight to block his confirmation
as a member of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia.
   That would guarantee a return to the brand of political drama
that flared last summer when the lawmakers killed the nomination of
black Republican William Lucas to become the Justice Department's
civil rights chief.
   Such fierce skirmishing between liberals and conservatives
accompanied the nominations of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court,
Daniel Manion to the appeals bench and other judicial candidates
during the Reagan administration.
   Behind the so-called judges war has been a fight for the
philosophical tone of the federal courts, which grew more
conservative in the eight years that Reagan appointees donned
judicial robes. And President Bush can carry the change further as
he fills 57 current vacancies on the federal bench.
   Actually, the administration's laggard pace in finding
candidates has brought on a lull for most of this year.
   Bush has sent just 18 judicial nominations to the Senate this
year, causing impatience even among Senate allies.
   Until the Thomas nomination, the only contested judicial nominee
has been Vaughn Walker, a San Francisco attorney who antagonized
gay rights groups and compounded his problems by waiting months to
resign from a private club with a history of bias against women and
blacks.
   Thomas offers fodder for a more dramatic conflict.
   He climbed out of childhood poverty in the rural South,
graduated from Yale Law School and became a protege of Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo.
   However, the outspoken 41-year-old conservative has been a storm
center since he became chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission more than seven years ago.
   A disciple of conservative economist Thomas Sowell, he says that
government should enforce fairness but, in contrast to many black
leaders, rejects any notion that government should compensate for
the wrongs of the past.
   ``I adhere to the principle that individuals should be judged on
the basis of individual merit and individual conduct,'' Thomas once
said. ``No one should be rewarded or punished because of group
characteristics.''
   Civil rights advocates say inaction by Thomas has caused
thousands of job discrimination cases to fall through the cracks.
   ``His actions as head of the EEOC ... suggest that he lacks the
commitment to equal justice, the qualifications and the judicial
temperament for a lifetime appointment to one of the nation's most
important courts,'' a group of civil rights groups and labor unions
told the Senate in a letter last week. Although the letter
criticized Thomas, it did not call on senators to reject him but
only to postpone their decisions until all the information is in.
   Republican senators are quick with reminders that Democrats and
civil rights groups blocked the confirmation of Lucas.
   Lucas, in Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, rejected chances
to criticize recent Supreme Court decisions limiting civil rights
laws. His answers led Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to drop his
endorsement and a number of black officials were among Lucas'
critics.
   After the nomination died, however, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
and other GOP lawmakers complained that a black candidate deserved
a better chance. The gesture amused civil rights leaders who
remember Thurmond as a leading advocate of states' rights in the
days of segregation.
   ``I've been listening to Sen. Thurmond for a long time,'' says
NAACP lobbyist Althea Simmons. ``It's interesting to see that he is
advocating for blacks when he has been just the opposite.''
   She said the NAACP could announce its decision on Thomas within
seven or eight days and that qualifications, not race, would be the
sole criteria.
   ``Race has nothing to do with this nomination,'' said Nan Aron
of the Alliance for Justice, a leading civil rights organization.
``Clarence Thomas has a record of being chair of the EEOC and he as
chair was engaged in the enforcement of civil rights in this
country, and it is that record that we must expect the committee
will scrutinize carefully.''
   The day after the White House sent the nomination to Capitol
Hill, Danforth told the Senate that Thomas ``has one thing going
against him and that is that he is a black lawyer of fairly
conservative political and judicial philosophy.
   ``The interest groups that did a job on William Lucas in the
Senate Judiciary Committee are mobilizing again to do a job on
Clarence Thomas.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Says She'll Step Down After Next Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has weakened her
position and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plans
to step down after winning another term, opposition leaders and
political observers said.
   A pro-Thatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated the
obvious and that her statements were no ``cause for astonishment.''
   Mrs. Thatcher told The Sunday Correspondent in an interview
published Sunday that she hoped to lead her Conservative Party to a
fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try
for a fifth.
   ``I think people would think it was time for someone else to
carry the torch,'' she told the newspaper.
   The Sunday Times of London said in a commentary: ``Mrs. Thatcher
has committed a colossal blunder.''
   ``She has given the riders for the Tory succession their
starting orders years in advance of the actual race,'' the
newspaper said.
   The next election must be held by the summer of 1992, but it is
expected Mrs. Thatcher will call it in 1991.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who turned 64 last month, has never previously
made it clear in public when she plans to retire as party leader.
She was elected in 1979, the first female prime minister in Europe,
and won re-election in 1983 and in 1987, when she said she planned
to ``go on and on.''
   Earlier this year, Mrs. Thatcher overtook Liberal Lord Asquith's
1908-1916 tenure as prime minister to become Britain's longest
continuously serving prime minister of the 20th century.
   Mrs. Thatcher's popularity is the lowest of any prime minister
since opinion polls began in Britain 50 years ago, and senior
colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership
style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief,
Nigel Lawson.
   Lord Callaghan, former Labor prime minister whom Mrs. Thatcher
defeated in 1979, said her comments had ``considerably weakened her
position.''
   If her party wins the next election, it is expected Mrs.
Thatcher would step down before her term ends to allow her
successor to choose a time to call a new election.
   ``My guess is that the Tory party will want someone as leader
who could take them through the next Parliament,'' Callaghan said.
   If Mrs. Thatcher resigns while in office, her successor elected
by the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval of
Queen Elizabeth II, but convention dictates that he or she seek a
mandate in a general election as soon as possible.
   The Sunday Times speculated she would step down by 1994. Mrs.
Thatcher would celebrate her 69th birthday that year and her
husband, Denis, will be 79 and ``his age may have been a factor in
her decision,'' the newspaper said.
   The newspaper predicted the opposition Labor Party will try to
promote leader Neil Kinnock as ``the occupant-in-waiting of 10
Downing St., who is ready, able and willing to complete a full
term.''
   Kinnock called Mrs. Thatcher's comments ``the interview of
someone preparing herself for quitting. Mentally, Margaret Thatcher
is preparing herself for packing her bags.''
   In an editorial today, the pro-Thatcher Daily Telegraph said
Mrs. Thatcher was merely stating the obvious by indicating she
would not seek a fifth term.
   ``Even were she not to fight a fifth election, Mrs. Thatcher
could yet enjoy seven more years in charge,'' it said.
   ``By then she would be in her 70s, and her devoted husband a
decade older ... Nonetheless, what other politician would be
expected to entertain an inquiry about his or her intentions in
seven years time? And can it really be a cause for astonishment
that Mrs. Thatcher is unwilling to commit herself to political
activity in her mid-70s and beyond?''

<HEAD>Court to Decide on Double Jeopardy in New York Car Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether a motorist who pleads guilty to drunken driving and related
traffic offenses in a fatal car crash later may be prosecuted for
homicide and assault.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by law enforcement
officials seeking to prosecute Thomas J. Corbin in connection with
an Oct. 3, 1987, accident on Route 55 in LaGrange, N.Y.
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, last
July barred Corbin's prosecution on homicide and assault charges.
The state court said such a prosecution would violate
double-jeopardy protections.
   Corbin was accused of crossing a double yellow line and striking
two other vehicles headed in the opposite direction. Brenda Dirago,
who was driving one of the other cars, was killed.
   Corbin pleaded guilty 24 days later to drunken driving and
driving on the wrong side of the road. He was fined and his
driver's license was suspended for six months.
   The local judge who sentenced Corbin apparently was unaware
someone had died in the crash. No one from the Dutchess County
district attorney's office appeared in court when Corbin pleaded
guilty or was sentenced for the traffic violations.
   Two days after the January 1988 sentencing, the district
attorney's office learned what happened and won an indictment on
various criminal charges, including negligent homicide and reckless
assault.
   The New York State Court of Appeals threw out the indictment on
grounds it violated Corbin's right against facing multiple
prosecutions for the same offense.
   The state court said that while Corbin and his lawyer ``may have
been less than forthcoming in their dealings with (the local judge)
... it certainly cannot be said the traffic infraction prosecution
was conducted, or the conviction obtained, with the knowledge of
the Dutchess County district attorney's office.''
   The state court barred use of a state law aimed at preventing
people from pleading guilty to minor offenses to escape prosecution
for more serious crimes.
   That law is designed to apply to cases in which prosecutors are
unaware or unable to inform judges of pending prosecutions for the
more serious offenses, the state court said.
   The state court also relied in part on wording in a 1980 Supreme
Court ruling that raised _ but did not answer definitively _ the
double-jeopardy question in similar circumstances.
   In Corbin's case, the state court said, the prosecution stated
in its charges that it intended to use the acts underlying the
traffic offenses to prove negligent homicide and reckless assault.
   The case is Grady vs. Corbin, 89-474.

   The talk in School District 27 was about hiring
white Christians, not blacks or Jews. And providing patronage jobs.
And cutting deals.
   Colman Genn, the school superintendent, taped all this talk with
a recorder fastened to his back and a microphone stuck to his
chest. The undercover educator's work, revealed at a hearing Oct.
23, led to the suspension of nine elected officials amid charges of
patronage, racism and anti-Semitism in their Queens district.
   ``We need a system with people responsible for dealing with
children instead of feeding off children,'' Genn said in explaining
why he did what he did. ``Our children should not be seen as cash
cows.''
   Genn's colleagues say his students have always come first, ever
since he came to the city's school system in 1958 as a gym teacher.
   As he moved up, Genn won raves for his work as principal of the
Manhattan Center for Math and Science, an East Harlem specialty
school that blossomed under his leadership.
   But things changed after he arrived in July 1987 at District 27,
an area that includes the predominantly white Howard Beach and
Breezy Point sections. Although more than half the district's
students are black, the nine-member school board included a single
black representative.
   Of the district's 1,690 teachers, 82.5 percent are white, above
the city average of 70.7 percent, and its 35 principals include
only a half-dozen blacks, below the city average.
   Under the city's decentralized system, 32 locally elected boards
run the city's elementary and junior high schools.
   Few New Yorkers vote in school board elections; there is little
media oversight of school board activities. Perhaps as a result,
some boards have been exposed in recent years as fonts of
corruption.
   Genn, 53, learned first-hand how district business was done
during a March 1988 trip to Los Angeles for a convention. He was
dining with local board members James Sullivan and Samuel Granirer
when they laid it all out, Genn testified before a school
commission last week.
   ``I was told that if I was a good boy and allowed them to handle
the hiring and appointments, I would have a long life and tenure as
superintendent,'' Genn recalled.
   An infuriated Genn approached the Joint Commission on Integrity
in the Public Schools about the conversation. They persuaded him to
surreptitiously tape his future talks with board members to expose
what was going on.
   Genn _ although sometimes visibly nervous and sweating _ did
just that, swapping PTA meetings for get-togethers with Sullivan,
Granirer, board member Sal Stazzone and 10th-grade teacher Richard
Lipkowitz. The contents of the tapes recorded between Feb. 6 and
Oct. 13 made clear exactly what was important to some district
officials.
   On one tape, Sullivan suggests creating a deputy superintendent
post specifically for a black to quell minority hiring concerns.
But he insisted the appointee be ``pliable ... I can't have a
(expletive) Mau Mau. I don't need anybody beating the war drums.''
   On another recording, Stazzone and Lipkowitz are heard
discussing District 27 when the latter is suddenly struck with an
absurd thought.
   ``I've never heard the word `children' or `education' enter into
our discussions in the last few years,'' said Lipkowitz.
   ``With anybody,'' responded a laughing Stazzone.
   And on a third, Sullivan explained how he expected business to
be done in the district: ``I'm a political leader, that's why I'm
here. And I make sure my people get jobs.''
   Genn's predecessor, Marvin Aaron, did his ``hiring out of a
synagogue,'' Sullivan said on one of the tapes.
   The Queens district attorney and U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney
have received copies of the tapes for possible criminal
prosecutions. Most of those involved have declined comment, but
Sullivan asserted his innocence.
   ``I've always acted in the best interests of the children and
the parents of School District 27,'' said Sullivan.
   The tapes were played when Genn testified before a commission
hearing; a day later, acting schools Chancellor Bernard Mecklowitz
suspended the board _ the fourth such move in the past three years
in the city's troubled system.
   Although Genn feared a backlash and requested police protection,
he has heard little but praise for his role.
   ```Colman Genn is a modern-day hero,'' said James Gill, head of
the commission. ``He acted out of conscience. He didn't act to
promote himself. That's what makes him a hero.''
   ``I've received calls from kids I taught 25, 30 years ago,''
said Genn. ``Everybody was concerned but everybody was very
positive.''

   The Thai navy today rescued two
crewmen from the Gulf of Thailand after their American oil drilling
ship capsized in a typhoon, but four other crewmen were found dead
in the wreckage and 85 were missing, the company said.
   Six crew members have been rescued from the 362-foot Seacrest
since it overturned early Saturday when Typhoon Gay swept through.
The company said the search for survivors would continue.
   The American company's Thai subsidiary said two Thai crewmen
were pulled from the water near the ship today after spending 50
hours equipped only with life jackets. They were undergoing medical
treatment.
   Divers found four bodies in the wheelhouse area of the 5,373-ton
vessel today.Two other bodies were found on the ship Sunday.
   Some oil workers and relatives of crewmen have said the vessel
was too top-heavy to withstand high winds and seas and complained
that the ship was not given enough warning of the typhoon.
   Graydon H. Laughbaum, president of Unocal Thailand, today told
reporters the 10-year-old Seacrest was safe and had been inspected
in March.
   ``For one thing, the eye of the typhoon passed directly over the
Seacrest. The typhoon came up very suddenly,'' he said.
   A press release from Unocal said a management team from its Los
Angeles headquarters had begun an investigation of the disaster.
   ``The group is looking into the accuracy and timeliness of the
weather reporting and the action taken by Unocal Thailand and the
Great Eastern Drilling and Services, Inc., the ship's operators,
before, during and after Typhoon Gay hit the area,'' the release
said.
   Unocal identified one of the dead recovered Sunday as Andrew
Chalmers, a 28-year-old British field engineer. One of the four
found today was identified as Kent Nolen, 27, an assistant driller
from the United States.
   Thai fishermen on Sunday rescued four crewmen, indentified as an
Indonesian and three Thais and reported in good condition. The fate
of the other 85 crewmen from 13 countries was unknown.
   Aboard were 64 Thais, seven Americans, five Britons, four
Australians, three Filipinos, three Singaporeans, two Malaysians,
two Indonesians, two Canadians, two Danes, one West German, one New
Zealander and one Norwegian.
   ``We will carry on with the search as long as we think there may
be some people alive,'' said Boonrich Chaiyean, deputy commander of
the Thai navy base at Sonkhla, the main base for the search and
rescue operation.
   A Unocal press release said air was being pumped into the hull
of the $15 million Seacrest, which might be towed once the
underwater probe is completed.
   ``Unocal's sea rescue operations continued throughout the
night,'' the press release said. ``Company helicopters and 10
aircraft and 12 vessels of the Thai navy joined the search at
daybreak this morning.''
   The Seacrest capsized in the gulf's Platong field, one of
several being exploited for natural gas by Unocal. It is 270 miles
south of Bangkok.
   After hitting the gulf, Typhoon Gay swept inland across the
peninsula of southern Thailand, where at least 30 people were
killed and extensive damage was reported in several provinces.
   About 30 fishing boats with an unknown number of crewmen aboard
have been reported missing by the Thai navy. Local press reports
said that the number of missing is in the hundreds.

<TEXT>
   Republican Lynn Martin, a five-term
congresswoman and close ally of President Bush, today launched her
bid to unseat one of the nation's best-known Democratic senators,
Paul Simon.
   Martin, 49, formally began her campaign for the U.S. Senate more
than four months after she announced her decision to take on Simon
in next year's election.
   ``Illinois deserves better'' is the theme of her campaign,
Martin said in an early morning speech at Greater Rockford Airport
in the northern Illinois district she represents in Congress. Her
departure began a six-city fly-around stint through Illinois.
   ``Illinois deserves better than a part-time senator who sees
America through a rear-view mirror and wants to go back to the
1930s,'' said Martin.
   During his first Senate term, Simon crisscrossed the country in
a failed bid for the 1988 Democratic nomination for president.
   The lawmaker said June 21 that she would challenge Simon, who
upset incumbent GOP Sen. Charles Percy in 1984. She's since
continued to jab at Simon on a number of issues, including defense
spending and federal funding.
   GOP strategists have made Simon a top target for defeat in next
year's Senate campaign, a decision that will bring extra money and
campaign assistance for Martin.
   President Bush, who encouraged Martin to enter the Senate race,
is scheduled to stump for her Nov. 20 in Chicago, and has promised
to return to Illinois during next year's campaign.
   Martin seconded Bush's nomination at the 1988 Republican
National Convention and served as national co-chairman of his
presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
   The former head of Transit Casualty Co.,
a high-risk insurer that left up to $4 billion in unpaid claims
when it crumbled in 1985, has pleaded innocent to a charge of
filing a false financial statement.
   George Pettengill Bowie, 64, Transit's former chairman and chief
executive officer, entered the plea Thursday in Circuit Court after
his indictment by a Cole County grand jury, county prosecutor
Richard Callahan said Sunday.
   Transit's court-appointed liquidator, Burleigh Arnold, said
Transit left $3 billion to $4 billion in unpaid claims in all 50
states from mainly corporate customers with high-risk insurance
policies, including policies on race horses and toxic waste dumps.
   That made Transit the biggest property and casualty insurance
failure ever in this country, said Michael Barrett Jr., staff
director for the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, which is probing the case.
   Callahan kept the indictment sealed until Sunday.
   The charge stems from the company's 1984 financial statement,
which indicated a $21.9 million surplus when in fact Transit's
records were ``incomplete, inaccurate, inauditable and in such a
state that it was impossible to construct an accurate financial
statement,'' the indictment said.
   The statement was filed with state regulators.
   ``Their records were so unreliable they shouldn't have filed
anything,'' Callahan said.
   Bowie's lawyer, Arthur Margulis, said the 1984 statement was
drawn up in compliance with Missouri law and industry practice. He
said there was no intent to defraud.
   Nevertheless, Bowie resigned Friday as a partner in the law firm
of Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman and Dicker because of the
charge, Margulis said.
   Filing a false annual statement is a felony punishable by up to
five years in prison. No trial date has been set for Bowie, who is
free on a $250,000 signature bond.
   Cole County Circuit Judge Byron Kinder ordered the state to
liquidate Transit in 1985.
   Transit obtained a Missouri charter in 1945 to sell liability
policies for the transportation industry. In the 1960s, Beneficial
Standard Corp. acquired Transit and moved its headquarters from St.
Louis to Los Angeles.
   Though based in Los Angeles, the company maintained its Missouri
charter, giving the state jurisdiction over its liquidation.
   Arnold and several regulators said Transit expanded rapidly in
the early 1980s by giving its 17 managing general agents freedom to
write high-risk policies.
   Agents wrote policies for satellites, horses and toxic waste
dumps, among others, Arnold said. Transit found itself with a $15
million claim from Union Carbide Corp. for part of Carbide's
liability in the 1984 gas leak in Bhopal, India, that killed more
than 2,500 people, Arnold said.
   Many of the managing general agents never kept adequate records
and the company did not have a central computer to keep track of
its policies.
   ``The way things were being done, there wasn't any way even
Transit Casualty could know what was going on,'' said Donald
Ainsworth, director of the Missouri Division of Insurance from 1981
to 1985. ``Policies were being written that were not being
reported.''

<TEXT>
   A small airplane hired by a political
party crash-landed today after being hit by gunfire, but
authorities reported mostly calm on the eve of an election leading
to the end of a century of foreign rule.
   The single-engine plane chartered by the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, favored to place second among 10 parties, was hit by
bullets over the northern region of Kavango, police said. The two
men aboard were unhurt, and police launched a hunt for the
attackers.
   Tuesday marks the start of a five-day, U.N.-supervised election
for 72 seats in an assembly that will draft a constitution for
Namibia when it becomes independent from South Africa next year.
   Fred Eckhard, chief spokesman for the U.N. monitoring force,
said officials were nervous because ``there is a deep-seated mutual
distrust on the part of the different parties.''
   Eckhard agreed with other officials in describing the territory
as generally tranquil, but added: ``The peace is a very fragile
peace.''
   Posters and television advertisements financed by U.N. and
territorial officials have stressed that ballots will be secret and
urged the 701,453 registered voters to ``vote without fear.''
   The overwhelming favorite to win the most votes among the 10
parties is the South-West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO,
which waged a 23-year war against South African rule. If SWAPO wins
win two-thirds of the votes, it will be allowed to draft a
constitution without compromising with other parties.
   SWAPO's leading rival is the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a
multiracial coalition that participated in a South
African-installed transitional government.
   The Organization of African Unity, which backs SWAPO, issued a
statement today urging Namibians ``to vote decisively ... to rid
this country and its people of the agony of colonialism,
degradation and servitude.''
   South Africa captured Namibia from the Germans in 1915 and
agreed last year to grant independence as part of a regional treaty
that also calls for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.
   Angola's official news agency today reported that U.N. officials
have confirmed the withdrawl of all Cuban troops from southern
Angola below the 13th parallel, in accordance with the treaty.
   Angola is to be free of Cuban soldiers by July 1, 1991.

   The president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops today issued a rallying cry to end abortion on
demand in a speech celebrating the bicentennial of the Catholic
hierarchy.
   In a speech opening the fall meeting of the bishops' conference,
Archbishop John May of St. Louis paid respect to the nation's
democratic traditions and said the Roman Catholic Church must
exercise its right to express its opinion on abortion.
   ``Don't forget the baby. That's all the Catholic Church is
saying to America,'' said May in what was also his farewell address
as conference president.
   Leaders of the nation's largest religious denomination are
scheduled to discuss statements on abortion, the Middle East and
AIDS and elect a new president during the four-day meeting.
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, conference vice
president, is expected to be elevated to the presidency, while nine
other archbishops vie for the vice presidency.
   The bishops on Sunday celebrated a special bicentennial Mass in
the Basilica of the Assumption, the nation's oldest cathedral,
marking the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the Diocese
of Baltimore and the appointment of the Rev. John Carroll, on Nov.
6, 1789, as the first U.S. Catholic bishop.
   In his speech, May said Americans need to hear the 53
million-member church's voice on issues ranging from the Middle
East to poverty, but the one issue where ``clear-cut moral
principle stands tall above all else'' is abortion.
   If someone were to propose dropping any 6-month-old baby who
seemed to be a burden to the family into the Baltimore Harbor, May
said, people would be aghast.
   ``What is the difference between a child a few months after
birth and a child a few months before?'' May said.
   The nation's approximately 300 Catholic bishops will take up the
abortion issue Tuesday, when debate is scheduled on a proposal
calling on Catholics to give ``urgent attention and priority'' to
the issue.
   In his talk, May also praised a proposed document on the Middle
East as an example of the ``American way'' of reaching agreement by
discussion and consensus.
   On Sunday, a bishops' committee announced some last-minute
revisions in its Mideast statement, which had been criticized by
Jewish groups.
   The criticism of the draft statement by the Ad Hoc Committee on
the Middle East said the proposal went too far for calling on
Israel to negotiate directly with Palestinians over ``territory and
sovereignty.''
   The revisions added a statement that there must be negotiated
limits to the exercise of Palestinian sovereignty to protect
Israel's security. It also noted that Israel has been the victim of
acts of terrorism by groups aligned with the Palestinian cause.
   ``It is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists
in the Middle East,'' said the committee made up of Archbishop
Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, Cardinal John O'Connor of New York and
Archbishop William Keeler of Baltimore.
   The revised document, ``Toward Peace in the Middle East:
Perspectives, Principles and Hopes,'' also adds a call for the
release of all hostages held in Lebanon.
   The statement on AIDS came after an earlier document approved by
the conference's administrative board came under attack. The
document was criticized for giving conditional approval to condom
education in public schools as long as sexual abstinence outside of
marriage was presented as the only ``medically correct and morally
sure way'' to prevent AIDS.
   The drafters of the first document _ ``The Many Faces of AIDS: A
Gospel Response'' _ said it showed a willingness to work with
people of other faiths and a recognition that condoms may save some
lives when used by individuals who could not be persuaded to change
their sexual habits.
   But some bishops said it would be misinterpreted as condoning
artificial birth control and sex outside marriage.
   The proposed statement _ ``Called to Compassion _ A Response to
the HIV-AIDS Crisis'' _ attacks condom education as a ``quick-fix''
approach, and urges that youngsters be taught chastity instead.
   Mahony, chairman of the commitee that drafted the second
statement, said bishops never have indicated a willingness to
compromise on Catholic teaching to become more influential in the
public policy debate.
   ``Even to start down that road is fraught with difficulties,''
he said.
   With church custom dictating Pilarczyk's succession of
Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis as president of the bishop's
conference, interest has turned toward the vice-presidential
election.
   The candidates who have agreed to be nominated are Archbishop
Anthony J. Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Keeler, Mahony, Archbishop
Eugene A. Marino of Atlanta, Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of
Newark, N.J., Archbishop J. Francis Stafford of Denver, Archbishop
Oscar H. Lipscomb of Mobile, Ala., Archbishop Daniel W. Kucera of
Dubuque, Iowa, and Archbishop Thomas C. Kelly of Louisville, Ky.

   The government today announced tough new
capital standards designed to reduce further failures of savings
and loan institutions.
   ``These new standards will require savings institutions to
become stronger and will thereby reduce the exposure of the federal
deposit insurance fund to losses,'' said M. Danny Wall, director of
the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   The OTS, created by the savings and loan bailout law passed by
Congress last summer, estimated that 800 thrift institutions with
assets totaling $600 billion would not be able to meet the capital
requirements immediately.
   Those failing to comply will have immediate grwoth restrictions
imposed on them by the OTS and will be required to develop capital
restoration plans detailing the steps they will take to meet the
new standards.
   The announcement was made as James Barth, OTS chief economist,
told an S&amp;L industry group in Chicago that thrift institutions lost
at least $2.5 billion in the July-September quarter, likely the
best performance in a year.
   Anticipating the new standards, many thrifts have been selling
assets and reducing their size recently and the OTS said many of
them will be able to meet the new requirements by the time they
take effect on Dec. 7.
   A key provision in the reform bill requires S&amp;L owners to risk
more of their own capital as a buffer between losses and government
deposit insurance funds.
   The standards require S&amp;Ls to keep in reserve at least 1.5
percent tangible capital, 3 percent core capital and meet a
risk-based capital requirement.
   Tangible capital consists of common stock plus retained earnings
but excluding most intangible assets such as goodwill.
   Core capital consists of tangible capital plus goodwill.
Goodwill is an accounting term referring to the amount above actual
cash value paid by an investor for a troubled thrift.
   Risk-based capital consists of 8 percent of the value of
risk-weighted assets when the new rule is fully phased in.
   ``The minimum capital for the credit risk component _ the risk
of a loan not being repaid _ is calculated by multiplying the value
of each asset (including off-balance-sheet commitments) by one of
five risk factors and holding 8 percent of the result as the
minimum required capital,'' the OTS said.
   It said the five risk categories range from zero percent for
cash to 200 percent for certain delinquent loans and repossessed
property.
   For example, it said, a typical home mortgage has a risk factor
of 50 percent. Thus, the minimum required capital on a $100,000
home mortgage loan would be calculated by multiplying $100,000 by
50 percent and the resulting $50,000 by 8 percent, resulting in
$4,000 risk capital.
   The risk-based capital requirement was described as the ``most
important'' of the three standards which will make S&amp;L standards
``no less stringent'' than those imposed on the commercial banking
industry.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether lawsuits charging employers with violating a key federal
anti-bias law must be filed in federal, rather than state, courts.
   The justices said they will review a $27,000 judgment won by a
Chicago Ridge, Ill., woman against the Yellow Freight System Co.,
the trucking company she works for.
   Lawyers for Yellow Freight are urging the justices to rule that
Coleen Donnelly waited too long before filing a lawsuit invoking a
federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that bars
on-the-job discrimination.
   Mrs. Donnelly's lawsuit invoked the federal law within a
required 90-day deadline but the case at that time was in an
Illinois state court. Lawyers for Yellow Freight said that does not
meet the deadline requirement because, its appeal contends, federal
courts have exclusive authority to hear Title VII cases.
   Some federal appeals courts have ruled that such suits must be
filed in federal court, but the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that state courts have co-existing authority
to hear Title VII cases.
   The 7th Circuit court noted that Congress, in passing Title VII,
did not say whether lawsuits invoking the law must be filed in
federal court.
   ``Unless Congress includes ... an explicit statement vesting
jurisdiction exclusively in federal court, state courts may presume
that they share jurisdiction concurrently with the federal courts
over a federal cause of action,'' the appeals court said.
   Mrs. Donnelly applied to Yellow Freight for a job as a
dockworker in October 1982. Although the company was not hiring at
the time, Mrs. Donnelly was told she would be the next dockworker
hired.
   Although Yellow Freight began hiring dockworkers again in
February 1983, Mrs. Donnelly was told repeatedly that the company
was not hiring.
   She was hired 18 months after the February 1983 start-up of
hiring.
   Mrs. Donnelly in early 1985 filed charges with the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging sexual bias in Yellow
Freight's delay in hiring her.
   The commission issued a right-to-sue notice on March 15, 1985 _
triggering a 90-day deadline.
   Mrs. Donnelly sued in state court within the deadline. But her
original lawsuit did not allege a Title VII violation, only a
violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act.
   The suit later was amended to include allegations of a Title VII
violation.
   After Yellow Freight had the case transferred to federal court,
Mrs. Donnelly was awarded $27,656.6l in back pay and prejudgment
interest.
   The case is Yellow Freight System vs. Donnelly, 89-431.

   The Coca-Cola Co. announced today it will give
$50 million over the next 10 years to improve education, shifting
its philanthropic priorities in order to concentrate on the
nation's schools.
   Improving the schools has become such a major issue that the
philanthropic foundation wanted to concentrate its efforts only in
that direction, officials at the Atlanta-based company said.
Programs for minority students will be emphasized.
   In the past, the Coca-Cola Foundation has donated money to other
causes, such as health and the arts, as well as education.
   The first specific grants under the program include:
   _$5 million to historically black colleges and universities in
Atlanta.
   _$2 million to the United Negro College Fund for schools outside
Atlanta.
   _$2 million to the University System of Georgia for projects to
improve public elementary and high schools in the state.
   _$2 million for Hispanic education including literacy programs
in Texas, California and Florida.
   _$1 million to the University of Notre Dame for minority faculty
development.
   _$300,000 to Georgetown University for international business
education.
   _$360,000 for a program in which high school seniors are
designated as ``mentors'' to help freshmen get along in school.

   The nation's savings and loans lost at least $2.5
billion in the July-September quarter, a large loss but still
likely the best performance in a year, a government economist said
today.
   James Barth, chief economist of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said preliminary figures indicate that S&amp;L red ink
will be at its lowest point since a $1.8 billion loss in the third
quarter of 1988.
   Thrifts last year lost a record $13.4 billion. Official figures
for the July-September period of this year will not be released
until next month, but if Barth's projection proves correct, losses
for the first nine months of this year will total $9.7 billion, on
track for a slight improvement for all of 1989.
   Barth, speaking at the annual convention of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, said losses in the latest quarter were
concentrated heavily in the approximately 260 institutions under
government control, although the rest of the industry also lost
money.
   He attributed the reduction to government steps to close or
rescue failed S&amp;Ls and said he expected the decline in losses to
continue.
   ``The fact that we've gotten rid of a lot of institutions ...
suggests that the numbers should get smaller over time,'' Barth
said.
   In Washington, meantime, the thrift supervision office announced
toughened capital standards designed to prevent further S&amp;L
failures. It estimated that 800 thrifts with assets totaling $600
billion would not be able to meet the new requirements when they
take effect Dec. 7 and would be subject to restrictions on growth.
   In September, the industry continued to shed assets for the
fourth consecutive month in an effort to meet new capital standards
going into effect next month, Barth said. Institutions reduced
their portfolios by about $15 billion, up from a record $13.4
billion shrinkage in August, he said.
   Deposit outflows totaled about $9 billion, up from $5.1 billion
in August and close to the record $10.8 billion in January, he said.
   Meanwhile, S&amp;L executives, looking back on their industry's most
turbulent year in five decades, are wondering if they fought a
little too hard to wrap themselves in the American dream of home
ownership.
   When leaders of the league mapped strategy last year for the
debate on a taxpayer bailout of the industry, they decided their
key argument would be that S&amp;Ls are needed to finance housing.
   Congress listened. Legislation enacted Aug. 9 authorized $50
billion to rescue or close an estimated 500 failed S&amp;Ls. However,
it also required the survivors to devote more of their assets to
home lending.
   Starting July 1991, 70 percent of thrift assets must be in
housing, up from 60 percent currently.
   As S&amp;L executives gathered today for the 97th annual convention
of the industry's oldest and largest trade group, the 70 percent
requirement was the top item on a list of changes they want
Congress to make in the three-month-old bailout bill.
   ``We think this may have gotten us into the overkill area,''
said league President Frederick L. Webber.
   ``It's a classic example of getting killed by a myth,'' said
Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.
``They bought their own propaganda and now they're choking on it.''
   The problem is that the new rules are taking effect as advancing
technology makes it easier for competitors to enter the mortgage
market and on the eve of a decade expected to see the housing
sector weaken in response to the aging of the Baby Boom generation.
   James W. Christian, chief economist of the league, estimated
that new households in the 1990s will require 12 million to 13
million new housing units, down from 15 million units in the 1980s
and 17.5 million units in the 1970s.
   ``However you varnish it ... weak aggregate demand for housing
... is going to be part of the picture of the 1990s,'' he wrote
recently.
   According to Ely, technology has split the home financing
business into three parts: mortgage funding, mortgage servicing and
mortgage origination.
   Insurance companies and pension funds are taking over the
funding part by purchasing securities from Freddie Mac and Fannie
Mae, large congressionally chartered companies that buy mortgages
to back the securities they sell.
   Since anyone can sell a mortgage to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
S&amp;Ls now must compete for origination business against commercial
banks and private mortgage companies.
   And, because most thrifts are too small to compete effectively
against large, computerized mortgage-servicing operations, which
collect homeowners' monthly payments, they are losing that part of
the business as well, Ely said.
   Webber, however, said, ``We are confident ... there will be a
successful thrift industry provided we can correct some of the more
onerous parts of'' the S&amp;L bill.
   Among the other changes the group wants:
   _A reduction in the industry's contribution to the bailout. The
12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which are industry owned and
provide low-cost loans to member S&amp;Ls, ar being tapped for $2.6
billion in retained earnings through 1991. And, they're supposed to
contribute $300 million a year to help pay the interest on
government borrowing for the bailout.
   _An increase in the limit on loans to one lender. The bill cuts
the limit from 100 percent of capital to 15 percent. Under the old
standard, one default could push an S&amp;L into insolvency. But Webber
said 15 percent may be too stringent and suggested something
between the two figures would be more appropriate.
   _Equal deposit insurance premiums for both thrifts and
commercial banks. Both types of institutions will have to pay more
for deposit insurance. But the thrift rate will be higher than the
bank rate until 1998 when both types of institutions will pay 15
cents for every $100 in deposits.

<HEAD>Conference on Reducing Greenhouse Effect Opens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental leaders from around
the world began meeting today with the goal of persuading
industrialized nations to commit themselves to measures to stop the
potentially catastrophic greenhouse effect.
   The Dutch, the hosts of the two-day 68-nation conference, hope
participating nations will commit themselves to stabilizing
emissions of greenhouse-related gases by the end of the century.
   The greenhouse effect is believed to be the cause of a gradual
warming of the atmposphere. The warming could eventually turn
fertile land into deserts and flood densely populated coastal
plains.
   Experts believe that to stop the effect, a major reduction is
needed of emissions of greenhouse-causing gases, particularly
carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs, methane, and
nitrous oxides.
   But a number of nations are unwilling to commit themselves to
such measures for now and say this conference is not the proper
forum for such commitments.
   They want to postpone formal discussions until a meeting of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in Washington next year.
   A draft communique calls for ``recognition of the need to
stabilize (emissions) by the year 2000 and to develop policy tools
to achieve that goal.''
   The United States, Britain and Japan had opposed the communique
but on Sunday agreed to reopen talks on the issue, according to
Marjan van der Giezen, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Environment
Ministry.
   ``It looks as if we might succeed in keeping those three
aboard,'' Ms. Van der Giezen told The Associated Press.
   Participation of major industrialized nations in the fight
against the greenhouse effect is ``essential,'' according to Pier
Vellinga, the Dutch Environment Ministry's key expert in climate
policy.
   In all, developed nations in the northern hemisphere _ including
the East bloc _ produce 65 percent of all greenhouse-related
emissions, Vellinga said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush had dinner with former
President Nixon at Sunday to hear a report on Nixon's
just-concluded trip to China, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said today.
   During his trip, Nixon had urged the United States and China to
put aside differences and resume normal relations despite lingering
tensions from the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy forces.
   ``The president (Bush) found those views quite interesting and
productive but our general policy has not changed,'' Fitzwater told
reporters. ``We do want to preserve the relationship and ... as
events proceed we will continue to consider possible actions that
would change our relationship.''
   The White House dinner had not been announced in advance. After
the meeting, Nixon returned to New York.
   Other dinner guests included Vice President Dan Quayle, Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft, deputy national security adviser Robert Gates, CIA
Director William Webster, White House chief of staff John Sununu
and Michel Oksenberg, a China scholar and a member of Nixon's
entourage.
   Fitzwater also disclosed that Bush met at Camp David, Md., on
Saturday with officials from the CIA, State Department and National
Security Council to receive the first in a series of briefings to
prepare for his Dec. 2-3 shipboard meeting in the Mediterranean
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev off the coast of Malta.
   He said Bush also would hold talks with experts outside of the
government.
   ``The president will be extremely well prepared as evidenced by
the first meeting ... and many to come. We know what we want out of
it,'' Fitzwater said. ``We know what we want to say. We want out of
it a good conversation that illumniates the policies on both
sides.''
   While the United States has been trying to keep expectations
low, the Soviets have taken a different tact. Soviet spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov suggested the talks would lead to the end of the
Cold War.
   Fitzwater deflected questions about that comment by jokingly
saying, ``Well you've got to be a little careful (about) old
Gennady. He's pretty smooth. Sometimes his unfamiliarity with the
language kind of overstates things. We're on the right track.''

<HEAD>EDS: Leads with 5 grafs to ADD U.S. response. Pickup 3rd pvs, `The

<TEXT>
   The decision-making inner Cabinet has accepted
an American plan for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks but
demanded written U.S. assurances on several points, including that
PLO members be excluded.
   ``Without these assurances, we will not enter into these
talks,'' said Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   The Bush administration welcomed the action and called on Egypt
and the Palestinians to respond promptly.
   ``We still think there's a lot of work to be done, but we think
it's a positive sign in terms of moving the process forward,'' said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Despite Israeli demands for U.S. assurances on various points,
Fitzwater said the Cabinet's decision ``provides further impetus
for an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.''
   The vote came 10 days before Shamir plans to visit the United
States to meet with Jewish groups and senators. He hopes to meet
with President Bush, but the two sides have not yet agreed upon a
meeting.
   The inner Cabinet voted Sunday 9-3 to accept the plan designed
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who leads the left-of-center
Labor party, welcomed the decision, saying it will keep the United
States involved in the search for peace.
   ``I think this has great significance because we prevented the
loss of America as part of the peace process,'' Peres said on
Israel Television.
   Israeli media reports had said the United States might put
Middle East peace efforts aside for other issues if Baker's peace
offer were rejected.
   Ahimeir said Israel will ask for six assurances.
   He said Israel wants guarantees there will be no talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organization and that talks be limited to
Israel's elections proposal, which offers limited autonomy in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Baker's offer calls for an Israeli-Palestinian meeting to break
a stalemate over the stalled Israeli plan, first announced six
months ago.
   Israel Television said another of the six assurances was that
Washington would support Israel if it left the talks because ground
rules were violated.
   Peres and a spokesmen for Shamir said Israel expects the U.S.
assurances in writing.
   Sunday's Cabinet vote was unanimously supported by Labor's six
ministers but created a split in its coalition partner, Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc. Those ministers voted 3-3.
   Likud hard-liners say the Baker plan will lead to indirect
negotiations with the PLO. ``The move will bring disaster,''
Industry and Trade Minister Ariel Sharon said on Israel radio.
   In Cairo, the PLO's executive committee announced it had
``crystalized a united position'' on the Baker plan, but members
would not say if the organization accepted or rejected the proposal.
   Should the PLO approve the plan, the next step would be for
Baker to meet with Egyptian and Israeli officials to work out the
composition of a Palestinian delegation acceptable to Israel.

   An apartment building housing three
families collapsed during earthquake aftershocks and injured six
people, the Algerian news agency reported Monday.
   The building was in the famed Casbah section of the Algerian
capital, where many older structures suffered heavy damage in a
severe earthquake Oct. 29.
   Six aftershocks struck the North African country Saturday and
Sunday, registering from 3.5 to 4.2 on the Richter scale. The
building fell Sunday, the agency said.
   Many residents of the Casbah fled their homes to camp in the
open air Saturday night, the agency said, fearful of the
aftershocks.
   A quake measuring 6 on the Richter scale struck Oct. 29 and was
followed 12 minutes later by one measuring 4.8 on the scale. The
quakes killed 26 people and injured at least 450, causing heavy
damage to towns and villages east of Algiers along the
Mediterranean coast.

<HEAD>Teachers Spurn Moslem Girls Wearing Scarves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CREIL, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 60 junior high school teachers took a
unanimous stand Monday against allowing three Moslem girls wearing
headscarves in class.
   The vote came as students returned to school after a holiday
weekend that featured a new attempt by the government to end a
debate pitting freedom of religious expression against laws
separating church and state.
   After the teachers shut them out of the classrooms, Leila and
Fatima Athaboun and Samira Saipali went to the school library to
sit out the day as they have done since the dispute began in
mid-October.
   The girls have refused pleas from Principal Ernest Chenieres to
remove the ``hijab'' covering head, neck and ears, which they say
Islamic law orders them to wear in public.
   Chenieres maintains the scarves are potent religious symbols
that amount to proselytizing, banned by French law from the public
school system.
   The issue of wearing religious symbols in school has been
emotionally charged since the 19th century, when advocates of a
secular school system free from the influence of the Roman Catholic
Church won a bitter fight.
   On Saturday, Education Minister Lionel Jospin said he would seek
an advisory opinion from the Council of State, which rules on
constitutional issues but can be asked for advice on any topic the
government chooses.
   Jospin has been criticized from within his governing Socialist
Party and elsewhere for a decision that authorities should discuss
the issue with students and parents to persuade them to remove the
scarves.
   If persuasion fails, Jospin said, students must attend classes,
scarves or not. His decision to ask the Council of State for a
judgment was supported Sunday by Premier Michel Rocard.
   Islam is the second-largest religion in France, with more than 3
million adherants in a population of 55 million.

   Workers clashed during an
anti-government strike called by opposition parties to demand free
elections, and 265 people were injured, news reports said Monday.
   Police arrested 115 people during the strike on Sunday.
   The strike, the 61st this year, also called for an end to
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's 7-year-old government.
   Police said worst violence occurred at state-run Adamjee Jute
Mills, near Dhaka, where pro- and anti-strike workers clashed. At
least 150 workers were injured and 30 of them were hospitalized.
The jute mill is the country's largest and employs 200,000 people.
   In Dhaka, a city of 6 million people, police used batons to
break up a street play, a satire on Ershad, who seized power in a
bloodless military coup in 1982. At least 15 people were injured,
witnesses said.
   Ershad has rejected opposition demand to step down and order new
elections.
   Police said at least 100 people were injured during clashes
among rival political groups in the cities of Chittagong and Khulna.

<HEAD>Beijing Ends Campaign Against Illegal Street Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have shut down dozens of black
markets in the capital, exposed thousands of illegal street traders
and confiscated thousands of pornographic books in a 100-day
campaign, a newspaper said Monday.
   The campaign unearthed 110,000 unlawful businesses and gained
the government $567,000 in taxes and fines, the newspaper said.
   It said 36 black markets were closed down and 500 ``unlawful
cliques,'' many dealing in fake or inferior goods, were disbanded.
   Among the main targets of the cleanup were privately owned hair
salons, bars, cigarette booths, street billiard operators, black
market money-changers and unlicensed street traders.
   The paper said the campaign, part of a nationwide drive against
pornography, netted 820,000 copies of books, magazines and albums.
   It also appeared linked to moves initiated by the government's
current conservative leadership to control private enterprise.
   Authorities stress that private enterprise will continue to play
a supplementary role in China's socialist economy, but since the
June crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and subsequent purge
of reformers, advocates of market-oriented private trade have been
on the defensive.
   Many private businesses or small collectives have halted
operations because of increased taxes or inability to get credit,
energy or raw materials because the government now gives priority
to state-run enterprises.
   Before the campaign, Beijing officials had expressed concern
over what they described as a rampant increase in unlicensed
business activities.
   The report also said officials had persuaded 80,000 rural
laborers, who operate many of the free market street stalls, to
return to their hometowns.
   It said similar campaigns will be repeated to provide a ``clean
and fresh atmosphere'' for the Asian Games in Beijing next
September and October.

<TEXT>
   United Nations officials say all Cuban
troops have withdrawn from southern Angola below the 13th parallel
in accordance with an agreement signed in December, Angolan media
reported Monday.
   Brazilian Gen. Pericles Ferreira Gomes said Saturday he was
satisfied with the withdrawal after inspecting former Cuban bases
in Namibe, Huila and Cuando-Cubando provinces south of the parallel
that runs along Angola's central highlands, said a report from
ANGOP, the official Angolan news agency.
   Ferreira Gomes, who heads the U.N. monitoring mission, said last
week that half the 50,000 Cuban troops helping the Angolan
government in a 14-year civil war against U.S.-backed UNITA rebels
had left Angola ahead of the deadline set by the December agreement
signed by Cuba, Angola and South Africa.
   All Cuban troops are due out by July 1, 1991, under the
agreement that also calls for a halt to South African aid to UNITA
and commits Pretoria to granting independence to Angola's southern
neighbor, Namibia.
   The Cuban pullout began in January when the first 3,000 Cubans
left Luanda.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
has been fighting to share power since a Marxist government took
power in Luanda after Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975.

   Space shuttle Discovery will be
launched in two weeks on a military mission if NASA officials turn
up no problems during a two-day flight review that began Monday.
   The space agency has been aiming for a Nov. 20 liftoff, but
shuttle managers admit the schedule is tight to complete all
necessary work. They will set a date Tuesday after assessing the
readiness of all flight hardware, ground support and worldwide
tracking operations.
   Because the military payload in Discovery's cargo bay is
classified, the Defense Department and NASA have revealed very
little about the mission. Officials plan to announce a four-hour
launch period on the selected day and will make the countdown
public with just nine minutes remaining.
   Sources close to the project report the announced launch period
will be between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., making this only the
third after-dark shuttle launch in 32 missions.
   The sources also report the payload is a $300 million 2{-ton
satellite called SigInt, for signal intelligence, which is to
monitor Soviet missile tests and eavesdrop on selected military and
diplomatic communications. A similar satellite was launched by
another Discovery astronaut crew in 1985.
   The flight is expected to last four days.
   The crew for the upcoming flight are Air Force Col. Frederick C.
Gregory, the commander; Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot; and
three mission specialists, Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F.
Story Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.

   Despite Japan's reputation as a wealthy country,
about one in three Japanese says making a living is getting harder,
according to a poll released Monday.
   The poll revealed that 32 percent said their lives had become
harder in the past year, while only 3.3 percent thought their lives
had become easier.
   This represented a nearly nine percentage point increase in the
number of people saying their lives had become harder this year.
About 65.5 percent of those who said their lives had become harder
said they felt they could no longer live comfortably.
   While 63.1 percent of those polled said they were satisfied with
their lives, 35.9 percent were not. The survey also showed that the
number who said they were satisfied has been decreasing since 1986.
   The poll revealed that many people still dislike the consumption
tax, a new value-added tax that was instituted in April. More than
60 percent said they thought opportunists were using the tax to
raise prices.
   In response to a question on what issue they most wanted the
government to handle during the coming year, however, most did not
choose the tax issue.
   The most popular response was social welfare programs at 38
percent. Only 34.7 percent chose the tax issue, a fall of 6.2
percent from last year.
   It was the 35th ``Opinion Poll on the Life of the Nation,''
which was conducted by the prime minister's office in May. A total
of 10,000 men and women across the country were polled, of whom
77.4 percent responded.

   Democrats L. Douglas Wilder and James Florio, striving to give
their party a gubernatorial election sweep on Tuesday, brushed
aside favorable polls today and appealed for a strong turnout as
the off-year campaign wound down on a lingering negative note.
   ``The only polls that count are the polls taken tomorrow,'' said
Wilder when asked about a survey that said he was nine points ahead
of Republican J. Marshall Coleman in the race for governor of
Virginia. ``Turnout is very important,'' said Wilder, bidding to
becomne the first black elected governor of any state.
   Coleman also sounded optimistic, saying, ``Republicans can taste
this victory. The force is with us.''
   In New Jersey, Rep. Florio greeted morning commuters in Newark
and vowed to campaign as if his race with Republican Rep. James
Courter for the governorship were considered a tossup.
   The Democratic candidate was fighting overconfidence after a
poll that said he was leading Courter by 24 points. A Florio
victory would give the Democrats a governorship held by Republican
Thomas Kean for eight years.
   The Virginia and New Jersey races as well as the contest for
mayor of New York City were marked by a succession of negative
commercials that had party leaders suggesting it was time to look
for a way to tone down the attacks.
   Republican Rudolph Giuliani said Sunday that if he is elected
mayor of New York he will order an investigation of Democrat David
Dinkins' finances. Dinkins, bidding to be the first black mayor of
the nation's largest city, responded that former U.S. attorney
Giuliani ``just can't get the prosecutor out of himself.''
   Today, Giuliani amended his statement by saying Dinkins should
be investigated. ``It is not the function of the mayor to
investigate. Of course, that will be up to federal and state
authorities,'' he said through a spokesman.
   The two races for governor and the New York mayoral contest are
getting the most attention in a light political year being watched
for political trends that might impact on the 1990 elections when
34 Senate seats, 36 governorships and 435 House seats are on the
ballot.
   In Houston, 11 candidates are vying to fill the House seat held
by the Rep. Mickey Leland who was killed in a plane crash in Africa.
   New York is only one of hundreds of cities holding elections
around the country. In Detroit, 71-year-old Mayor Coleman Young is
trying to fight off a spirited challenge from 40-year-old Tom
Barrow, the man he beat easily four years ago.
   Cleveland voters are choosing between Councilman George Forbes
and state Sen. Michael R. White in a contest marked by nasty
personal attacks from both sides.
   Two cities _ New Haven, Conn., and Seattle _ are considered
likely to elect their first black mayors. State Sen. John Daniels
upset the Democratic establishment choice in his party's primary in
New Haven, a city that is 30 percent black. Norm Rice is the
favorite in Seattle where blacks are only a small percentage of the
electorate.
   The customary list of ballot propositions includes proposals to
finance a new baseball park in San Francisco and to express
opposition to cruise missile testing in Maine.
   Faced with the possibility of losses in the three most visible
1989 races, Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater minimized the
significance of this year's contests. ``All politics is local,'' he
said during an appearance Sunday on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley.''
   His Democratic counterpart, Ronald H. Brown, was on the same
program and reflected his party's optimism when he said victories
Tuesday by Wilder, Florio and Dinkins would indicate that ``clearly
we're moving in a new direction.''
   The emotional question of legalized abortion showed the
strongest potential for a political turnaround at the gateway to
the 1990s. During the past decade opponents of legalization claimed
creit for helping elect supporters of their view, including
Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and defeat
several members of Congress who supported abortion rights.
   But last summer's Supreme Court decision opening the way for
states to restrict access to abortions appeared to energize
advocates of legalization.
   Wilder ran television ads proclaiming his support for abortion
rights while Coleman, Courter and Giuliani all found themselves
trying to temper their opposition.
   In an interview late last week, Brown said abortion has ``had
tremendous impact politically. I think the Democratic Party is on
the right side of the issue.''
   ``We're trying to be the majority party, and we're a big enough
party to have differing viewpoints on all issues, and specifically,
abortion,'' said Atwater, appearing to move his party away from a
hard-line position opposed to abortion.
   During their joint appearance on ABC, Brown and Atwater sparred
on the subject of what to do about the negative tone of campaigns.
   ``I think there's too much of it on both sides,'' said Brown,
urging Atwater to join an effort to curb the candidate attacks.
   When Atwater said he would enlist in that effort only if it
included discussion of new campaign laws proposed by Bush and
largely unacceptable to Democrats, Brown retorted, ``This is really
a case of changing the subject, isn't it? The subject is negative
politics, dirty campaigning.''
   With Giuliani battling to overtake Dinkins in heavily Democratic
New York City, his media adviser, Roger Ailes, said there would be
no letup in the attack strategy.
   ``The only question is can Dinkins get over the finish line with
the question of integrity dragging around his ankles,'' said Ailes,
a leading architect of President Bush's 1988 campaign.
   With Republicans holding a two-seat edge in the New Jersey
Assembly, Florio was concentrating on districts Democrats have
targeted as key to their effort to regain control.
   ``Our message seems to have gotten through,'' Florio told
supporters at a Sunday breakfast. ``But if I don't have people in
the Assembly that are philosophically in line with the message I've
been trying to get across, then I'm going to have a mission to
carry out with one hand tied behind my back.''
   A Richmond Times-Dispatch poll said Wilder was leading Coleman
by nine points with 19 percent still describing themselves as
undecided.
   Coleman was in the northwestern part of the state to conclude a
weekend in which he charged his rival with privately pledging to
coal miners he would ``sabotage'' the state's right-to-work law by
permitting unions to collect dues from nonunion workers covered by
union contracts. Wilder says he supports the right-to-work law.
   ``It's not in the bag,'' Coleman told supporters at a picnic in
Front Royal. ``...We're coming around the corner. ... The undecided
are going our way overwhelmingly.''
   Wilder was in the southwestern corner of the state where he told
voters of the region's crucial role in his upset victory in the
1985 race for lieutenant governor.

<HEAD>Millions of Chinese Taking Second Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Chinese battered by inflation and
bored by their work are taking on second jobs, an authoritative
weekly said Monday.
   The Beijing Review said many of the moonlighters are simply not
showing up at their regular work, where job security is guaranteed,
so they can devote all their energy to their other jobs.
   Around 30 percent of workers in the southern city of Canton have
second jobs, while the moonlighting rate in the northeast city of
Tianjin has gone from 2 percent in 1982 to 20 percent last year, it
said.
   Shanghai has more than 1 million workers with outside
employment, 16 percent of the workforce. In the coastal city of
Wenzhou, known for its booming private enterprise, 70 percent hold
down at least two jobs.
   The weekly said China's irrational wage system, where street
peddlers are likely to earn far more than university-trained
workers, is one reason for the increase in ``Sunday engineers.''
   The State Statistical Bureau estimates that 1.39 million
technical personnel, saddled with low wages in their overstaffed,
underfinanced work units, have found part-time work, many in
flourishing private or locally run enterprises.
   Rapid inflation, running at near 20 percent, has forced many to
seek outside sources of income, the weekly said.
   Half the moonlighters in Beijing did their second jobs during
normal work hours and continued to receive free medical treatment,
labor protection and welfare services, it said. Some took extended
sick leave while others offered no explanation for their absence.
   State-run enterprises almost never fire employees because of
poor performance, and many show little concern over absenteeism
because of their surplus worker problems.
   The weekly said there is some concern moonlighters are taking
advantage of lax management to engage in illegal activities that
damage the interests of the state.

<HEAD>Fundamentalists Make Strong Showing in Election Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the beating of drums and cries of ``God
is great,'' Jordan's Islamic fundamentalists are advancing toward a
strong showing in the kingdom's first general election in two
decades.
   No other faction rivals the size and organization of the Moslem
Brotherhood group's campaign. That strength has raised hopes among
its supporters and caused concern for King Hussein and secular
Jordanians.
   Many analysts believe the Brotherhood's 26 candidates and their
allies could win 12 to 20 of the 80 seats in the parliamentary
voting on Wednesday, enough to have a significant effect on
legislation.
   ``We will erase all laws which allow adultery and vices and
place hurdles in the way of Islamic jihad (spiritual struggle) and
the word of God,'' Sheik Hammam Saeed, a senior Brotherhood leader,
told hundreds of supporters gathered at a recent rally.
   ``We will work hand in hand, God willing, to make this country
an Islamic country in all means and to make Islam the source of all
its laws,'' he said.
   The election was called following April riots in southern Jordan
protesting price increases and austerity measures.
   It is the first nationwide parliamentary ballot since 1967 and
the most open since 1956.
   The Parliament elected in 1967 was suspended in 1974 and revived
a decade later with a few elections to fill gaps caused by death.
It was generally compliant to government will, despite a few vocal
critics. Politicians have expressed hope that the new Parliament
will take a stronger role.
   Political parties have been banned since a leftist coup attempt
in 1957. The government announced Oct. 17 it won't enforce that ban
for this election, opening the door to greater democracy and looser
government control.
   The fundamentalists' apparent strength has alarmed some secular
Jordanians. Even the king last month urged his countrymen ``not to
mix religion with politics and avoid extremism.''
   He denounced efforts by some religious figures to reduce the
role of women in the workplace, saying such interpretations are
counter to Islam.
   The strongest attack came this week when Sultan Hatab, editor of
the government-owned Sawt Al-Shaab daily, said some ``who veil
themselves in religion and trade in it'' want ``to burn our
tongues, brains, existence and our wish for freedom.''
   More than 500 people who gathered to hear Saeed and other
fundamentalists jammed a parking lot beneath green banners
proclaiming ``Islam is the solution.'' In between speakers,
drummers beat a fast rhythm common to Brotherhood rallies.
   Men were separated from a large group of veiled women. Many in
the crowd bowed to pray in unison, a scene reminiscent of a mosque
service.
   ``My God, I see that Ayatollah Khomeini has returned!''
exclaimed a secular bystander rattled by the scene in a middle
class neighborhood where women commonly wear western garb and large
public gatherings are rare.
   But the Brotherhood's creed probably has more in common with
Saudi Arabia's strict religious code than with the Iranian
revolution led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Iran's Moslems are mostly Shiites, while those in Jordan and
Saudi Arabia belong to the mainstream Sunni sect. The difference is
as profound as that between fundamentalist American Protestants and
Eastern Orthodox Christians.
   ``In Jordan, we want Islam to govern our judicial and social
life and we are not calling for an Islamic revolution like
Khomeini,'' said Ghaleb Abu-Abood, a Brotherhood candidate in Amman.
   ``Khomeini's movement was associated with violence,'' he said in
an interview. ``We reject violence except in Israel to liberate the
Moslems' land, including its capital, Jerusalem.''
   The party rejects compromises which would accept Israel's
existence as a state.
   Engineers Association President Laith Shubeilat, the most
persistent government critic in the previous parliament, said he
opposes the Brotherhood call for an Islamic government ``at this
time'' because other reforms should take place first.
   ``It's true that we call for Islam to be the source of our laws
and a guide to our daily life affairs, but the Islamic laws should
be applied in such a way to fit with the needs of modern times,''
Shubeilat said.

<HEAD>Soviets Planning Toned-Down Celebration of Bolshevik Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a long winter of discontent approaches, Soviets
are preparing for a more sober celebration of the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution that brought a troubled brand of socialism to their land.
   Lenin's portrait in red and white is hanging once again on KGB
headquarters at Dzerzhinsky Square. Shopworn decorations and giant
red banners adorn the major streets in preparation for Tuesday's
72nd anniversary, when military hardware will clank and rumble
through Red Square.
   But it is clear that few from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
down are interested in repeating the show of bravado that was
standard on Revolution Day just a couple of years ago.
   And there are signs that restive minorities and disgruntled
workers, in whose name Lenin seized power, can find little to
celebrate.
   _ A local chapter of the People's Front movement in the Baltic
republic Latvia has declared the Great October Socialist
Revolution, as it is called here, not a revolution at all, but ``a
government coup ... that cut short the process of democratization
that started after the February 1917 revolution.''
   Communist Party officials in the Latvian capital of Riga said
efforts to belittle the revolution could destabilize the republic,
which along with neighbors Lithuania and Estonia is pushing fast
and hard for autonomy.
   _ Workers building a new subway in the Ural Mountains industrial
center of Sverdlovsk rejected the city government's plans to
organize brigades of shock workers to finish the first tunnel by
the holiday. Such gargantuan efforts have been a part of Soviet
life for decades. But this time the newspaper Izvestia said ``the
workers did not want to become a part of another whitewash'' and
the city had to back down. The new completion date is in the third
quarter of 1990.
   _ The Kuznets Basin of Siberia has almost ground to a halt due
to a lack of gasoline. Shops in the coal-mining area that in July
erupted in strikes over poor living and working conditions are
nearly empty and there isn't enough gas for plows to remove the
first snow from the streets, Tass said. A shipment of fuel was
dispatched from Irkutsk 730 miles to the east, but on Siberia's
roads it will take five days to get there. It should arrive Tuesday.
   Cold rain and heavy clouds pressed down on Moscow in the days
preceding the holiday, and even the prospect of four days in a row
off from work didn't appear to help the mood. Soviets worked
Saturday instead of Monday, with Sunday through Wednesday off.
   This year, a crumbling distribution system and spasmodic coal
strikes are making supplies of food, consumer goods, and even heat
and electricity a worry.
   In Vorkuta in the Soviet Arctic, where coal miners walked off
their jobs again Oct. 25, a strike spokesman said police asked the
workers whether they planned any disruption of the celebration
there. ``We respect the holiday, but if we go to the parade we'll
go with our own slogans,'' said spokesman Vladimir Deneka in a
telephone interview.
   Soviet officials already have made clear the Revolution Day
celebration in Moscow will be toned down.
   Official slogans have been a part of the festivities for years,
but the number of them has fallen steadily under Gorbachev. In 1986
there were 50. This year there are 16.
   For the past two years, the Bolshevik slogan ``Workers of the
world unite!'' has been dropped, and there is scant mention of
Lenin. The slogans instead urge Soviets to get on with the business
of restructuring the economy and society.
   One senior Western diplomat who has watched many Revolution Day
celebrations said the 1989 slogans are far less militant than a few
years ago.
   This year's parade will be smaller than in previous years, said
Col. Gen. Nikolai Kalinin, head of the Moscow military district.
Kalinin, who until recently was the head of Soviet airborne forces,
told Tass that 220 military vehicles and 8,197 soldiers will file
past Lenin's mausoleum. Many of the soldiers in the parade will be
Afghanistan war veterans.
   Activists have appealed at meetings in the last week for people
to join an alternate parade column they say will be forming in
northwest Moscow.
   Gorbachev has reduced the adulation of party and government
leaders that stuck in official celebrations from Stalin's time
through the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev from 1964-82.
   But the Soviet leader still believes that his people have kept
their faith in Soviet socialism, are beginning to transform it, and
do have something to celebrate.
   In a meeting with officials of the state-run media in October,
Gorbachev said it was time for the press and for Soviets generally
to get over their preoccupation with finding fault.
   ``The English have a proverb: It is better to light one candle
than to curse the darkness all your life,'' Gorbachev said.
``People already are lighting the candles and we cannot ignore
this.''

   The first plane in a high-tech Customs Service
radar fleet has been plagued by electronic and mechanical problems
that seriously compromise its ability to find and track
drug-smuggling aircraft, according to agency documents.
   One Coast Guard officer who went along on an early mission
summed up: ``A lot of `Gee Whiz' gadgets and color displays _ but a
lot of the basic requirements for useful detection and tracking are
absent.''
   Deficiencies have included an unreliable computer system that
has trouble locating and tracking smugglers; faulty on-board
communications for the crew, and a problem with a spinning, metal
radar dome, according to the documents, most of them written by
crew members.
   Some initial reports critical of the performance of the first,
$27 million P-3 airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft were ordered
rewritten by an agency supervisor to stress success and not
failures, according to the documents and Customs sources.
   Some of the same problems have afflicted a second P-3 delivered
last April at a cost of $30.6 million, according to the documents
and sources. Congress has approved $35 million for a third P-3. All
the planes are based at Customs' Surveillance Support Center at
Corpus Christi, Texas.
   The P-3 has been used for years to detect enemy submarines, but
the new electronics have been custom designed for the drug war.
   Officials at the Customs Service and the manufacturer, Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Co., but both say the plane works well
overall, though they concede some problems exist.
   ``It works and it works great,'' said Peter Kendig, acting
director of the Surveillance Support Center. He said there are a
``few glitches'' in the system that tracks the speed and course of
potential targets and in a separate system for fixing the location
of other planes, but added they are being resolved.
   He said the P-3 AEWs were mainly responsible for detections
leading to 36 arrests from Jan. 1 to Aug. 10 this year, seizures of
37,000 pounds of marijuana and 8,300 pounds of cocaine as well as
vessels, aircraft and vehicles.
   John McGinnis, director of Lockheed's airborne early warning
program, said the firm is making improvements in the tracker and in
other areas because of ``anomalous behavior that we could not
prevent. The plane is functioning but there are problems with it
and we are correcting it. The airplane and the tracker are very
capable and doing their job,'' he said, adding the firm hopes to
have the difficulties fixed by the first of next year.
   The plane is not designed to intercept suspected smuggler
aircraft or ships. Instead, it monitors a wide expanse of airspace
and open seas, and when a suspicious craft is sighted, other
Customs Service planes are summoned for pursuit.
   The P-3 AEWs can be crucial to the nation's drug interdiction
effort because 51 percent of the 112,000 kilograms of cocaine
seized during 1988 came by air, including 45 percent in private
planes, according to the federal government's multi-agency El Paso
Intelligence Center.
   According to the Customs documents, problems with the
electronics cropped up almost immediately after Lockheed delivered
the first four-engine turboprop to the Corpus Christi center in
June 1988.
   One Customs source said the plane's course, altitude and speed
readings have been so unreliable that crewmen worry that
interceptors they send after a drug plane could end up colliding
with the target.
   ``You can't use the system for interception and that's what this
magic is all about,'' said a crew member who would speak only on
condition of anonymity.
   Both of the P-3 planes have kept flying while efforts continue
to fix the problems.
   According to documents and interviews with knowledgeable agency
sources, the problems on the first P-3 AEW include:
   _The multicolored, multigraphic computer screens had trouble
tracking target planes for speed, altitude, direction and distance.
Some single targets were displayed as multiple images. Targets were
lost when the P-3's computer system ``crashed.'' Ships registered
on the computer as planes moving at hundreds of knots, thousands of
feet in the air.
   _It was discovered in November 1988 that some bolts attaching
the heavy, metal radar dome to the plane were ``overtorqued and had
sheared off.'' Customs supervisors said the rotodome was not in
danger of separating from the aircraft, but one memo suggested the
dome would become ``a neat frisbee when it would come off from
25,000 feet.''
   _ Radar specialists on board were unable to monitor pilots'
transmissions, a handicap that would _ according to a memo _
``hinder safety of flight and impede crew coordination.'' A memo
warned of the potential for a total communications failure.
   One supervisor at Corpus Christi ordered two crewmen to alter
highly critical reports of the first P-3's performance during a
then top-secret mission, Operation Barrier, in late July and early
August 1988. This was the first operational test of the new P-3.
   ``To allow production `as is' will provide the Customs Service
with an undeveloped asset that requires additional personnel (to)
operate it, as well as producing a high stress environment to do so
from,'' concluded one memo that was later rewritten.
   A number of documents about the P-3s were colorful, semiofficial
in-house Customs memos called ``Eagle Droppings.'' ``Those stupid
ghost tracks. They're like Herpes, you can't get rid of them,'' one
such memo said on Nov. 18, 1988, referring to false readings on
suspected targets.
   Identification of the authors of most of the documents was
obscured by sources who made the material available.
   After Operation Barrier was completed in early August 1988, four
reports were written: two highly critical, then two more favorable
versions.
   One of the originals, dated Aug. 2, said ``deficiencies in the
tracking program'' required use of antiquated ``raw radar'' to
``verify the validity'' of the computer displays and to ``provide
accurate intercept data.''
   The same author rewrote his report _ after being told to,
according to sources _ and called the operation ``a complete
success.'' However, yet another memo, on May 2, 1989, said in
reference to the newly arrived second P-3 AEW: ``What has been done
to the tracker? Not a damn thing.''
   Despite the difficulties, Kendig at the Corpus Christi
surveillance center, called the aircraft ``a cost-effective piece
of equipment, giving taxpayers one of best bangs for the buck in
government today.''
   He said incorrect altitude readings, and displays of ships as
planes are ``characteristic of the radar system'' and ``the
military has the same problems.''

   Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz and the
International Committee of the Red Cross renewed calls Monday for
the release of two Red Cross relief workers kidnapped a month ago
in southern Lebanon.
   The families of Emilio Erriquez and Emanuel Christen, both Swiss
nationals, warned the greatest threat to the hostages was that they
might be forgotten.
   A Red Cross spokeswoman said the Oct. 6 kidnapping had deprived
81 civil war victims of rehabilitation treatment by forcing the
closure of its orthopedic center in Sidon, where the two men helped
fit artificial limbs.
   Delamuraz repeated his government's condemnation of ``this
inhuman act.'' He called on all parties in Lebanon to respect
international humanitarian law and allow the Red Cross to continue
its work helping Lebanese and Palestinian people in the country.
   ``We are all concerned by this act of violence ... and are all
affected by events in Lebanon,'' Delamuraz said on Swiss radio.
   Appealing for an ``end to this ordeal,'' the Red Cross said all
Lebanese parties, the PLO and other Palestinian organizations in
Lebanon had condemned ``this outrageous and unjustifiable act.''
   No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. The PLO
and Sidon police contend that Emanuel and Erriquez are held by
Fatah Revolutionary Council, a breakaway guerrilla group led by
Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal. The group has denied
the accusation.
   Another Red Cross delegate, Peter Winkler, was kidnapped a year
ago and released after one month in captivity. Death threats after
Winkler was freed prompted the Red Cross to pull out from Lebanon.
It returned several weeks later after Lebanese factions guaranteed
there would be no more attacks on the neutral humanitarian
organization.
   Eighteen Westerners are missing in Lebanon. The longest held is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Premier Ruud Lubbers completed his
third coalition government Monday, with the appointment of a
Christian Democrat as traffic and waterways minister, Dutch
Television reported.
   Hanja Maij-Weggen, a member of the European Parliament, is the
third woman in Lubbers' center-left cabinet, which has more female
ministers than any previous Dutch government.
   The other two are Ien Dales, the interior minister, and Hedy
d'Ancona, head of the Welfare, Culture and Public Health Ministry.
Both are Labor Party members.
   On Saturday, Dutch media announced the appointment of another
Christian Democrat, Ernst Hirsch Ballin, as justice minister.
Hirsch Ballin, 39, is a former Justice Ministry official and law
professor at Tilburg University.
   Both Lubbers' Christian Democrats and the Labor Party have seven
seats in the government, which is expected to be sworn in Tuesday.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DALKON SHIELD
   
   The court removed the last major hurdle to carrying out a $2.5
billion settlement for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth-control
device.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected a challenge by
some 650 of the thousands of women likely to share in a trust fund
established by A.H. Robins Co., manufacturer of the intrauterine
device.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case but
four votes are needed to grant such review.
   The justices also turned down an appeal challenging that portion
of the settlement barring individual lawsuits against A.H. Robins'
insurer, Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.
   The cases are Menard-Sanford vs. A.H. Robins, 89-441, and
Anderson vs. Aetna, 89-442.
   
   MORMONS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether money given directly to
Mormon missionaries by church members is a deductible donation
under federal tax law.
   The justices voted to hear the appeal of a Mormon couple from
Idaho who were denied tax deductions for subsidizing their two
sons' missionary service.
   The case is Davis vs. U.S., 89-98.
   
   MOTHER
   
   The court turned away an appeal by a woman threatened with jail
if she lets her boyfriend stay overnight while her children are in
the house.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the Rhode
Island woman's rights were not violated by a judge's order
restricting her having overnight male guests.
   The case is Parrillo vs. Parillo, 89-75.
   
   JOB BIAS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether lawsuits charging employers
with violating a key federal anti-bias law must be filed in
federal, rather than state, courts.
   The justices said they will review a $27,000 judgment won by a
Chicago Ridge, Ill., woman against the Yellow Freight System Co.,
the trucking company she works for.
   The case is Yellow Freight System vs. Donnelly, 89-431.
   
   HANK WILLIAMS
   
   The court turned down an appeal by a woman who says she is Hank
Williams Sr.'s daughter.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Cathy Yvonne
Stone waited too long before suing for a share of the late country
music legend's copyright royalties.
   The case is Stone vs. Williams, 89-295.
   
   PUNITIVE DAMAGES
   
   The court passed up a chance to decide whether huge
punitive-damage awards in personal injury lawsuits may be
unconstitutional.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected appeals in two
cases from Alabama and one from Nevada that raised the issue.
   The cases are Combined Insurance Co. vs. Ainsworth, 89-282;
Clardy vs. Sanders, 89-440; and Vintage Enterprises vs. Jaye,
89-456.
   
   DRUNKEN DRIVING
   
   The court agreed to decide whether a motorist who pleads guilty
to drunken driving and related traffic offenses in a fatal car
crash later may be prosecuted for homicide and assault.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by law enforcement
officials seeking to prosecute Thomas J. Corbin in connection with
an Oct. 3, 1987, accident on Route 55 in LaGrange, N.Y.
   The case is Grady vs. Corbin, 89-474.
   
   TAKEOVERS
   
   The court refused to block states from giving business managers
broad power to block takeovers by other corporations.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to a Wisconsin
anti-takeover law.
   The case is Amanda Acquisition Corp. vs. Universal Foods, 89-372.
   
   DIPLOMAT
   
   The court turned down a bid by Mozambique's ambassador to the
United Nations, described as one of Africa's richest men, to shield
himself from a potentially costly divorce lawsuit in Connecticut.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling that
diplomatic immunity does not protect Ambassador Antonio Deinde
Fernandez from being sued by his estranged wife.
   The case is Fernandez vs. Fernandez, 88-1042.

   Nicaraguan rebels said today they
will meet representatives of the Nicaraguan government in New York
this week for their first direct talks in more than a year.
   The meetings will take place Thursday and Friday at the United
Nations.
   Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, proposed a meeting when he
canceled a 19-month cease-fire with the U.S.-backed Contras on
Wednesday. He suggested the meeting be held this week. The Contras
proposed Thursday and Friday.
   Contra military leader Enrique Bermudez told The Associated
Press, ``We have accepted the new proposal for dialogue from
Ortega.''
   ``We will make another effort to end the war and bloodshed in
Nicaragua. We will make another effort to have the Nicaraguan
electoral process be fulfilled Feb. 25, 1990,'' he said.
   Bermudez said the rebel delegation, comprised of himself and
four rebel commanders, will travel Thursday from Tegucigalpa to New
York.
   In New York, a senior U.N. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said all issues will be on the agenda, including the
disbanding of the Contras, security guarantees for rebels returning
to Nicaragua, and political reform in Nicaragua.
   The last time the Contras and Sandinistas held direct talks was
in June 1988. Those talks broke down when Nicaragua refused to
agree to sweeping Contra demands for reform, including an end to
government control of the army and police.
   Under a Central American peace plan signed last year, the
Contras are to be disbanded by Dec. 5.
   So far, few have shown any inclination to lay down their weapons
and return home, although some have returned to Nicaragua with
their weapons.
   Ortega said infiltrating Contras have killed dozens of people in
the country and are trying to disrupt the campaign for national
elections, to be held Feb. 25. He cited that as the reason for
calling off the cease-fire.
   The Contras denied Ortega's allegations.
   The State Department has said about 2,000 Contras have
infiltrated Nicaragua in recent weeks from Honduras. About 10,000
Contras remain in Honduras and 4,000 are in Nicaragua.
   In Nicaragua, sources in the southern region of Chontales, Boaco
and Rio San Juan provinces told The Associated Press today there
had been intense military activity for several days in the area.

<HEAD>Some Think Quake Was Triggered by Tidal and Atmospheric Forces</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some researchers say changes in atmospheric
pressure and the tidal pull of the sun and moon may have triggered
California's disastrous earthquake, and many scientists call the
theory plausible but still unproven.
   A few studies have suggested quakes happen more often during
very high ocean tides _ when solar and lunar gravity also tug at
solid ground _ and when shifting masses of heavier air create
certain high-pressure systems and related winds that press down on
and rub against the ground.
   The government warned Oct. 12 of the highest Pacific tides in
years during the week of the Oct. 17 quake on the San Andreas
Fault. The jolt measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed at least
66 people in the San Francisco Bay area, and happened during
breezy, warm and dry conditions dubbed ``earthquake weather'' in
California folklore.
   Quakes aren't caused by such weather, but might be triggered by
the same atmospheric pressure conditions that create warm winds,
said meteorologist Jerome Namias, of the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography in La Jolla.
   ``Abnormal pressures and wind systems operating on the fault
could encourage slipping motion along the San Andreas, which if
other conditions were right, would then trigger this quake,'' said
Namias, who headed the National Weather Service's extended forecast
division for 30 years. ``It's conceivable the high tide added to
this condition.''
   ``I would say it is at least 90 percent likely there was some
(tidal) influence on the timing of this quake,'' said astronomer
Stephen Kilston, of Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory.
   But many seismologists remain skeptical.
   ``The idea of triggering earthquakes by tidal or atmospheric
forces is at least physically plausible,'' said seismologist Lucile
Jones, of the U.S. Geological Survey. ``The problem is that none of
the studies have been very convincing.''
   Jones and others said statistical analyses failed to convince
them correlations between quakes and tidal or atmospheric forces
are more than coincidence.
   ``Just like a poker player can think his royal flushes are
caused by his rabbit's foot, some people find what they think are
patterns in the random distribution of earthquakes,'' she said.
   Namias said his unfinished preliminary study shows that during
autumns since 1947, quakes were more frequent when high pressure
hovers above western Canada.
   The study covers only Southern California. But Namias said
``amazingly high'' pressure was centered over Canada during the
recent quake, when winds rotating clockwise brought warm southeast
winds to Northern California.
   A 1983 study found Southern California quakes of magnitude-6 and
larger were most likely when tidal forces are strongest: near full
or new moons, within a couple of hours of sunrise or sunset, and
within two years of when the moon is farthest north of Earth _ a
point reached every 18.6 years.
   Each of those conditions can pull faults apart to trigger
quakes, suggested the study published in Nature by Kilston and UCLA
geophysicist Leon Knopoff.
   Three days before the Oct. 17 quake, the moon was full and was
closer to Earth than it had been in three years, Kilston said. The
quake happened an hour before sunset. Two days later, the moon was
at its northernmost point in its monthly cycle.
   Tidal forces are stronger than atmospheric forces. But no one
has been able to show tidal gravity actually created stress on a
fault during an earthquake, said Bruce Bolt, a seismologist at the
University of California, Berkeley.
   Bolt said he doubts atmospheric forces extend deep enough
underground to trigger fault movement.
   Tidal and atmospheric stresses ``are not trivial. It's
reasonable they might be able to set off a fault that's ready to go
anyway,'' said Don Anderson, director of the California Institute
of Technology's seismological laboratory.
   ``I'm prepared to accept it if somebody makes a good case, but I
haven't seen a good case yet.''
   Advocates of the tidal and atmospheric theories don't claim such
forces cause quakes, only that they might be the last straws needed
to set off a quake on a section of fault already about to snap
under accumulated stress caused by movement of giant plates of rock
that make up Earth's crust.
   Namias published a study last year showing summertime quakes in
Southern California happened more often when low pressure covered
the West and high pressure hovered over the eastern Pacific. He
speculated winds flowing from high to low pressure might trigger
quakes by piling seawater against the coast.
   Kilston said killer quakes that rocked California in 1857, 1933,
1952 and 1987 all happened within two years of the peak of the
18.6-year lunar cycle and near full or new moons and sunrises or
sunsets.
   Jones said such timing is coincidental. A much more thorough
Geological Survey study found no link between tides and quakes, she
said.

<HEAD>Attorney: Insurance Company Paying Truitt in Ship Explosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An insurance company has agreed to pay former USS
Iowa sailor Kendall Truitt $100,000 in the death of a crewmate whom
the Navy blames for the shipboard explosion that killed 47,
Truitt's attorney said today.
   The policy, taken out a year ago by Clayton Hartwig with Truitt
as the beneficiary, played a part in the initial Navy investigation
of the April 19 disaster. Truitt was eventually cleared, but the
Navy continues to say that it is likely that Hartwig set off the
explosion on purpose to commit suicide.
   Today, Amex Assurance Co. of San Rafael, Calif., reached an
agreement with Truitt and the Hartwig family to pay the $100,000,
said Truitt's attorney, Ellis Rubin.
   ``We have settled the claim, and they are going to pay the full
policy,'' Rubin said. Some of the money _ Rubin refused to say how
much _ will be given to the Hartwig family.
   Rubin said the payment was one more piece of evidence showing
Hartwig did not blow up the gun turrett to kill himself, as the
Navy believes. ``If the insurance company thought he had committed
suicide, they would not have paid,'' he said.
   Hartwig named Truitt as the beneficiary of a $50,000 policy,
which had a clause doubling the benefit for accidental death.
   Initial leaks from the Navy investigation suggested that Truitt
and Hartwig had a homosexual relationship that had gone sour, and
said Truitt was a target of the probe because of the insurance
claim.
   Truitt, who is married, strongly denied any sexual relationship
with Hartwig, or any involvement in the fatal blast. The Navy's
official report cleared Truitt in the case.
   Rubin said Truitt, currently stationed at Mayport Naval Station
near Jacksonville, is to testify Wednesday in Washington before a
congressional committee investigating the explosion and would have
no comment before then.
   Hartwig's family had initially protested payment of Truitt's
claim. That prompted Truitt to sue Amex Assurance, a division of
American Express, in U.S. District Court in Miami.

   The fate of the baseball Giants, tax increases to boost
education, and a proposed anti-smoking ordinance in the heart of
tobacco country are among 56 statewide propositions and dozens of
local referendums voters decide on Tuesday.
   Michigan voters will choose between two tax proposals to provide
up to $400 million in additional state funds for education.
   Washington state voters consider a ``Children's Initiative,'' a
penny rise in the sales tax to increase by $360 million education
and social spending for children.
   Among the more interesting citywide contests, residents of
Greensboro, N.C., where popular cigarette brands are manufactured,
will decide whether to limit public smoking.
   In the Bay area, a proposal to raise $115 million for a new
stadium to keep the National League champion San Francisco Giants
from fleeing faces tough odds in the wake of huge costs from
earthquake damage. San Franciscans also will weigh a ``domestic
partners'' measure that would entitle unmarried couples working for
the city the same funeral and sick leave benefits as married
couples.
   In nearby Concord, Calif., a first-ever vote by a U.S. community
on ending discrimination against AIDS victims has attracted a
heated, last-minute advertising blitz.
   Foes trying to overturn a recently enacted Concord ordinance
that prohibits such discrimination sent voters a postcard showing a
man shooting a hypodermic needle into his arm.
   The postcard caption reads, ``Don't Protect High-Risk Behavior.
You could be sued for not renting to this man. You could be sued
for not hiring this man.''
   In affluent, conservative Irvine, Calif., residents weigh a
measure that would remove the words ``sexual orientation'' from the
city's human rights ordinance, thus ending its applicability to
homosexuals.
   ``There never has been gay discrimination in Irvine. If it's not
broke, don't fix it,'' said Christina Shea, 39, an Irvine homemaker
and member of the Irvine Values Coalition that favors the measure.
``This law has caused such divisiveness, a pitting of citizen
against citizen.''
   Seattle residents consider a measure ending forced school busing
and promoting educational choice.
   In St. Louis, voters will consider a four-cent property tax hike
for the St. Louis Symphony. Critics in the Missouri legislature
have called the symphony elitist.
   Voters in New York City, under U.S. Supreme Court order to
replace its legislative system with a more representative one, are
expected to pass a charter revision that would do away with the
Board of Estimate, which allows each borough one vote regardless of
population.
   Texas voters face 21 statewide propositions, including one that
would triple the salaries of state legislatures from $7,200 a year
to $23,358 next year.
   There is little opposition to a second measure that would
authorize a $500 million bond issue aimed at bringing running water
and sewers to disease-ridden Texas border towns. Another would
finance a record $400 million build-up of the state's prison system.
   Texans also will decide whether to drop a 113-year-old provision
requiring state office-holders to publicly swear that they didn't
bribe their way into their jobs. Some consider the oath demeaning,
but at least one officeholder who recently took it said he didn't
mind.
   ``I kind of like it,'' said Secretary of State George Bayoud.
``During my swearing in, there were people from around the state
here and they said they liked it.''
   Texas Proposition 13 would enshrine a ``victims bill of rights''
in the state constitution, allowing victims to confer with the
prosecutor and receive restitution and information about an
accused's conviction, sentence, imprisonment and release.
   In Maine, a non-binding referendum on whether voters want the
Navy to stop its Tomahawk cruise missile testing over their state
has turned into an extended debate over the arms race. The testing
over Maine airspace began last winter.
   Maine voters also will vote on a contract to dispose of nuclear
waste from their state at a facility in Nevada.

   You name it, Donald Sutherland has had it.
   Polio, rheumatic fever, hepatitis, an appendectomy, pneumonia,
scarlet fever.
   ``And spinal meningitis,'' the actor said. ``I died ...''
   A reporter chuckled. Sutherland looked perturbed.
   ``Yes. I died. For four or five seconds,'' he said.
   Sutherland overcame the bout of meningitis, and said his
experience with disease since childhood left him with a deep
appreciation of the medical profession.
   He is the 1989 honorary fund-raising chairman of the Montreal
Children's Hospital, which hopes to raise $1 million this year to
pay for renovations and new equipment.
   Sutherland said concern for his five children makes him
especially sympathetic to the hospital's appeal. He has a farm in
Georgeville in Quebec and homes in Los Angeles and Paris.

   Actress Michelle Greene said she was able to
get producer Steven Bochco to make her ``L.A. Law'' character
independent and more attractive because Bochco is a ``feminist at
heart.''
   Miss Greene plays lawyer Abby Perkins in the NBC hit series.
   The actress, in an interview for the Nov. 11 issue of TV Guide
magazine, said she decided to talk to the show's producers about
her character after the first season.
   Abby was ``never seen doing anything involving the law,'' Miss
Greene said. ``She was this mousy creature to whom all kinds of
dreadful things kept happening. She had an alcoholic husband, she
got beaten up, her child was kidnapped, she had a messy divorce.''
   Finally, Miss Greene said she confronted the producers, saying
``I guess every show has to have the obligatory female victim in
it, but I don't want to play the victim any more. I don't want to
spend all my time crying on camera.''
   During the show's current and third season, Abby is on the
partnership track at the firm.

   ``When I was in my 20s, I was obsessed with how I looked and
thought the idea of getting older was terrifying,'' he said in an

   ``Now I find it rather fascinating, except for the fact that I

   James Brady, crippled in the 1981
assassination attempt on his then-boss, Ronald Reagan, was honored
for his work ever since on behalf of the disabled.
   The former White House press secretary got an award Thursday
from the Will Rogers Commission, in part because of his recovery
from the head injury.
   ``God did it. I didn't do it,'' Brady said Sunday, when he was
guest of honor at a parade.
   ``I went up there and God told me `I'm not ready for you yet.
... When I am I will call you back up here, but there are some
things I want you to do on Earth.' He didn't tell me what they
were, but I have an idea what they are _ like doing things I am
doing now for the disabled.''
   Brady, 49, was shot in the head during the assassination attempt
in Washington, D.C. He is vice chairman the National Organization
on Disability, a private, non-profit group that promotes acceptance
and employment of the nation's 37 million disabled citizens.
   Rogers, the late cowbody humorist, was an Oklahoma native.

   Choreographer Jerome Robbins is stepping down as
co-director of the New York City Ballet at age 71, but he's not
disappearing into retirement.
   Robbins, considered one of the century's greats, plans to keep
busy finishing his memoirs and developing ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' a medley of pieces from musicals he choreographed or
directed.
   ``It's important at my age to do other things,'' he said. ``I'm
resigning from the New York City Ballet; I'm not retiring from the
field.''
   The ballet company announced Robbins' resignation Sunday.
   He's stepping down as co-director, but Robbins is to begin
rehearsals soon at the City Ballet for a retrospective of his
ballets since 1944, to be presented next spring.
   Robbins ballets include ``Fancy Free'' and ``The Guests,'' while
his Broadway work includes ``West Side Story,'' ``Fiddler on the
Roof'' and ``Peter Pan.''
   Peter Martins, the City Ballet's other co-director, will be
solely responsible for the company's artistic policy after Robbins'
resignation becomes effective.
   Robbins said he also is considering working in Europe on stage
ballets or operas, but ruled out the possibility of directing any
other company.

efforts only in that direction.
   The grants will be made during the 1990s to public and private
schools at all levels and to other programs that support innovative
education, with an emphasis on programs benefiting minorities.
   The first grants include a series of contributions totaling $5
million to historically black colleges and universities in Atlanta;
$2 million to the University System of Georgia; $2 million for
public and private Hispanic family literacy programs in Texas,
California and Florida, and other Hispanic education programs; $1
million to the University of Notre Dame to support minority faculty
development and exchange; and $2 million to the United Negro
College Fund for schools outside Atlanta.

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic nun missing more than
24 hours in Guatemala last week said she was kidnapped, tortured
and sexually abused by three men in a building where other people
were also apparently being abused.
   Diana Ortiz returned here Sunday and is resting quietly in a
convent in an undisclosed location, said the two nuns who brought
her back to this country, Sisters Darleen Chmielewski and Mary
Elizabeth Ballard.
   The kidnapping could have been an act of vengeance directed at
the church, or it might have been an act of personal vengeance for
some real or imagined slight, Ballard said.
   Chmielewski and Ballard said Ortiz, 31, wanted to make her story
public to draw attention to conditions in the Central American
country, where they said a repressive military regime backs a
puppet elected government and terrorism is a fact of daily life.
   Ortiz, a native of Grants, N.M., is a member of the Ursuline
Sisters of Mount St. Joseph, a religious community based near
Owensboro, Ky.
   After teaching kindergarten at two schools in Kentucky, she
moved to Guatemala to do the same kind of work in the village of
San Miguel Acatan.
   She was not involved in any kind of political activity, the
sisters said.
   But for some reason, around the first of this year, Ortiz
started receiving anonymous, threatening letters telling her to
leave the country. In July, a man she didn't know accosted her and
repeated the threat.
   Early Thursday morning, according to her written account, the
same man and another approached her, showed her a pistol and
threatened to harm her friends if she didn't come quietly with them
to answer some questions.
   She was taken by bus and car to a large building, under threat
of harm if she cried out, where they were met by a third man
dressed as a police officer. Ortiz said she could hear men moaning
and a woman screaming in pain.
   Ortiz said she was struck in the face and abused sexually. She
said the three men showed her photographs taken in San Miguel,
asked her to identify people pictured and burned her after each
answer she gave.
   Finally, another man came in and ordered the abuse to stop,
calling the other three ``idiots'' and saying, ``She is a North
American. Let her alone. It's already on the news on television.''
   She said this fourth man took her to Guatemala City, about an
hour's trip by car. He asked her to pardon them because they had
mistaken her for someone else, but also acknowledged that they had
sent her the anonymous letters.

   Rudolph Giuliani, trying to overcome a wide gap
in the polls with only one day to go, says David Dinkins' finances
should be investigated, no matter who wins the mayoral race.
   ``I think it is now quite clear that he does not have the
honesty and integrity that commends him to the voters,'' Giuliani
said Sunday in the second of two televised debates.
   The former U.S. attorney was asked if he, as mayor, would order
an investigation into Dinkins' finances. ``There's no question that
David Dinkins has to be investigated,'' he replied.
   Today, he added through a spokesman: ``It is not the function of
the mayor to investigate. Of course, that will be up to federal and
state authorities.''
   Dinkins bristled at what he called Giuliani's ``distortions and
complaints,'' reiterating that he has put to rest questions about
his failure to file income tax returns 20 years ago and about a
stock transfer to his son.
   Told of Giuliani's pledge to investigate him if elected, Dinkins
said: ``I suppose he just can't get the prosecutor out of himself.
He seems not to realize that he's running for mayor.''
   Dinkins would be the first black mayor of New York if elected
Tuesday. He beat the incumbent, Edward I. Koch, in the September
Democratic primary.
   The Giuliani campaign made fresh allegations Sunday that Dinkins
has concealed information about his finances.
   Dinkins, who is Manhattan's borough president, acknowledged that
he did not report on financial disclosure forms that a local
jewelry manufacturer paid for most of a trip to France he and his
wife took in 1988. But he said it was all a mistake and that the
man does not do business with the city.
   City officials are required to report all gifts valued at $500
or more. Dinkins promised to file amended forms today to include
the trip as a gift.
   The latest poll showed Dinkins leading Giuliani by 51 percent to
35 percent. The poll of 2,006 registered voters was conducted
Friday and Saturday for WNYW-TV. It had a margin of error of 2
percentage points.
   Giuliani opened Sunday's debate on WNBC-TV by hitting hard at
Dinkins' personal finances. He charged that Dinkins failed to make
good on a promise to reveal records showing he transferred stock in
a cable TV company to his son.
   Referring to Dinkins' charge from the first debate Saturday
night that New Yorkers need ``a mayor, not a prosecutor,'' Giuliani
said, ``I think the people of this town want a mayor who has
nothing to fear from a prosecutor.''

   An ex-army commander and three senior
officers pleaded innocent Monday to charges of plotting to
overthrow the government of President Kennth Kaunda.
   High Court Judge Weston Muzyamba ordered the four to be held
pending their next court date, which was not set.
   The state alleged Gen. Christon Tembo, 45, and the three
officers _ Lt. Col. Chongo Shulya, 37; Lt. Col. Bizwayo Nkunika,
40; and Maj. Knight Mulenga _plotted a coup before Zambia's October
parliamentary elections. At the time, Tembo was serving as Zambia's
ambassador to West Germany.

<HEAD>Arlington Cemetery Gets Military Stamp Collection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collection of 100 U.S. postage stamps
recalling the struggles and triumphs of the American military took
its place on display Monday at Arlington National Cemetery.
   ``Each stamp represents a chapter in the sacred and binding
agreement between America and its citizens which has necessitated
that men and women in uniform make sacrifices,'' said Postmaster
General Anthony M. Frank in presenting the collection.
   Entitled ``In Honor of Those Who Served,'' the stamps will
become a permanent display at the cemetery, with new
military-related stamps being added as they are issued.
   Frank said the Postal Service is currently planning a new series
of World War II stamps, including issues remembering Pearl Harbor,
the Lend Lease program and the Doolittle Raid over Tokyo, among
others.
   Opening of the display comes just a few days before Veterans
Day, and the stamps will be on view for the more than 4 million
annual visitors to Arlington Cemetery.
   The oldest stamp in the collection was issued in 1895 and
depicts Ulysses S. Grant, commander of Union Forces in the Civil
War.
   Stamps recalling the American Revolution include Washington
crossing the Delaware, foreign volunteers such as Lafayette, Von
Steuben and Pulaski.
   Other stamps include those honoring the Army, Navy, Air Force,
Marines and Coast Guard.
   Stamps on display also recall battles in the two woeld wars and
commemorate veterans of the wars in Korea and Vietnam.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Releases Three Guerrilla Prisoners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A delegation from the European
Parliament has secured the release of three guerrilla prisoners of
war in the first prisoner swap since the Soviet army withdrew in
February, the government said Monday.
   Also on Monday, an official report said a lieutenant general was
killed during clashes with U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. He was
the second general to be killed in a week.
   Lord Nicholas Bethell, a member of the British Parliament and
the vice chairman of the Committee on Human Rights, won the
prisoners' release Thursday after meeting with President Najib,
said government spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.
   Bethell will arrive in Peshawar, Pakistan, on Tuesday to
negotiate the release of Soviet and Afghan government prisoners of
war, Amani said. Bethell, translator of such Russian works as
Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ``Cancer Ward,'' came to Kabul via Moscow,
where he spoke with Soviet officials.
   Earlier reports said Bethell would negotiate for the exchange of
Soviet prisoners for 75 guerrillas. But Amani denied these reports
and said only three guerrillas were released. He said Bethell also
would try to secure the release of Afghan government soldiers.
   During the decade-long Soviet military intervention, there were
many prisoner exchanges between the guerrillas and the Soviets.
Since the Soviet pullout in February, no known exchanges have taken
place.
   The Soviets say about 310 of their soldiers are missing but the
guerrillas say they are holding no more than 75. The rebels say
35,000 of their men are in prisons either in Afghanistan or the
Soviet Union. Amani said Afghanistan is holding 2,500 guerrillas.
   Amani said the released guerrillass were soldiers who had been
sentenced to jail terms ranging from five to 10 years for
anti-government military actions.
   The released were members of the fundamentalist Moslem group
loyal to Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, the royalist and conservative
Mujadiddi family and the moderate Gaylani family. They had been
held in the infamous Pulcharki prison.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has offices
in both Kabul and Peshawar, will take the rebels to Pakistan, Amani
said.
   ``This is a step forward in the process of releasing
prisoners,'' he said. ``We hope a great number of prisoners will be
released.''
   The Daily Payam, the official organ of the ruling People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan, said guerrillas killed Lt. Gen.
Ali Akbar during fighting in Kandahar province in southeastern
Afghanistan. It said Akbar, a highly decorated officer, was buried
Sunday on Martyrs' Hill in Kabul.
   Last week, a general and several officers were killed in a plane
crash near Jalalabad. The government said the crash was an accident.

<HEAD>U.N. Envoy Hopeful of Peace Talks Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Nations envoy said Monday he is
hopeful a breakthrough is possible in the deadlocked peace talks
between Iran and Iraq.
   Jan Eliasson, Sweden's ambassador to the United Nations, arrived
in Baghdad Sunday night from Tehran on the third part of a new
diplomatic mission seeking to revive the stalled negotiations.
   He said he had ``fruitful discussions'' with Iranian leaders on
his three-day visit to Tehran.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, quoted the Tehran Times newspaper Monday as saying it was
doubtful Eliasson would be able to break the deadlock. It added,
however, that hopes for a ``lasting peace cannot be ruled out
altogether.''
   Eliasson, representing U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, spent four days in Baghdad last week at the start of his
mission, which is expected to last another two weeks.
   He said his talks in Baghdad and Tehran were ``productive and
interesting ... but as I'm in the middle of the process, I can't go
into details now.''
   Eliasson was to meet Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz, who
heads the Iraqi negotiating team at the peace talks that began Aug.
25, 1988 _ five days after a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the
eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
   Eliasson was expected to stay in Baghdad for two days before
returning to Tehran.
   Eliasson said he met Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and other officials, but he
declined to elaborate.
   U.N. officials have said Eliasson is not carrying any specific
proposals to break the impasse.
   Western diplomats said he was trying to convince Iranian and
Iraqi leaders to start an exchange of more than 100,000 prisoners
of war held by both sides and to convince the Iraqis to withdraw
from Iranian border territory they captured at the end of the war.
   Neither side has given any sign that their positions have
changed since the last round of talks collapsed in April.
   Iran claims Iraq holds 1,080 square miles. U.N. observers
estimate Iraq holds 386 square miles.
   The U.N. cease-fire resolution, accepted by both sides, calls on
them to withdraw all forces to pre-war borders and exchange
prisoners of war.
   Iran has said there can be no progress in the negotiations until
Iraq withdraws. Baghdad accuses Tehran of blocking the POW exchange
and refusing face-to-face talks.
   Iraq has insisted Iran allow the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, the
southern boundary between the two countries, to be dredged and
reopened after its enforced closure that began in September 1980.
   Iran refuses. The 120-mile waterway, formed by the confluence of
the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, was Iraq's main outlet to the
Persian Gulf before the war.
   Since the cease-fire, the Iraqis have been seeking to open other
waterways in the south to provide access to the gulf from the port
of Basra.

<HEAD>Long-Lost R.L. Stevenson Story Is Tale Of Odd Marriage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newly published long-lost short story by Robert
Louis Stevenson is a whimsical tale of an English gentleman, way
down on his luck, who marries a wealthy young woman and must obey
her every order.
   The story, ``The Enchantress,'' is published for the first time
in the fall edition of Georgia Review, the literary magazine of the
University of Georgia. David Mann, a professor of the Miami
University of Ohio, who found the manuscript among uncataloged
papers at Yale University, notes in the introduction he co-authored
that the story departs from Stevenson's tendency to focus on male
characters.
   The 27-page manuscript was hand-written in pencil, apparently in
1889 while Stevenson was on the schooner ``Equator'' from Hawaii to
Samoa, where he spent the last years of his life after leaving
Scotland because of his failing health. He died in Samoa in 1894.
   It is believed to be the last unaccounted-for complete Stevenson
story. It followed his best-known works, ``Treasure Island,''
``Kidnapped'' and ``A Child's Garden of Verses.''
   The newly discovered text, initially titled ``A Singular
Marriage,'' was suppressed for years by Stevenson's stepson, Lloyd
Osborne. He apparently felt the description of the female
character, Miss Croft, too closely resembled his mother, Fanny.
   It was sold for the first time in 1914, the year Fanny died, and
changed hands among collectors until it was bought at auction in
1923 and dropped from sight.
   In the first-person story the hero, a Mr. Hatfield, is lounging
outside a French casino, broke from gambling and wondering where
he'll find his next meal.
   He considers several options and decides on panhandling. His
first _ and last _ target is the lovely Miss Croft, a wealthy
orphan under the nominal control of a guardian who is himself
something of a gambler, and not a very good one.
   In cumbersome Victorian English, Hatfield puts the bite on Miss
Croft, who identifies him as a gentleman. She gives him 1,000
francs _ a bundle in those days _ turns up the charm and makes a
proposition.
   They are to meet as if by accident in Paris, take the same train
to Calais and the same boat back to England.
   ``You are a gentleman? Put your hand in mine and promise you
will obey me implicitly,'' she said.
   The Enchantress goes on to live up to her name.
   ``You have picked up a tool, Miss Croft,'' Hatfield says. ``What
do you propose to do with it. You have bought a slave. I hope you
like him.''
   Miss Croft proposes marriage on these terms: if Hatfield
refuses, she will set him up in a comfortable business and never
see him again; if he accepts he is to have a stipend of 300 pounds
sterling a year, paid quarterly _ less than he would get if he
refused _ and she gives the orders.
   She asks Hatfield ``whether you prefer to be my husband or my
pensioner.''
   They are married in a simple ceremony in Scotland only after
Hatfield, now love-struck, tries to forego the stipend. It is, her
lawyer assures him, a package deal _ no money, no Enchantress.
   After the ceremony she says goodbye on a street corner,
reminding him of his promise to obey and tells him to return to his
hotel room.
   Two days later a letter from her lawyer arrives saying it would
be better if he never saw Miss Croft again and that she had left
the country.
   It turns out that Miss Croft had just turned 21, but could not
get control of her inheritance from the guardian until she married.
Thinking her guardian not to be a sound businessman, she took the
obvious course and married.

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. George C. Wallace, whose
hearing has been failing for years, will undergo several hours of
tests to see whether doctors can help him without surgery.
   The tests, scheduled to end Tuesday at Veterans Administration
Hospital, also could lead to an operation known as a cochlear
implantation.
   Wallace, 70, has relied on the telephone in recent years to keep
in touch with people, but his increasing loss of hearing has
interfered with that, said his chief aide, Elvin Stanton.
   Wallace recently has had to write notes to converse. Hearing
aids haven't helped.
   ``Put a hearing aid on and all I hear is loud talking, but I
can't understand,'' Wallace told the Birmingham Post-Herald in an
interview earlier this year.
   ``We are hoping we can help him,'' said Dr. Jerry Alpiner, chief
of audiology at the VA hospital, ``and help him without resorting
to the implant. But we won't rule that out either.''
   Alpiner said patients should not expect too much from a cochlear
implantation, in which hearing is stimulated by tiny electrodes
hooked to a miniature microphone in the inner ear.
   Wallace has been in a wheelchair since an assassination attempt
in 1972.

<HEAD>West Germans Say Many East Germans Will Return if Reform Comes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SCHIRNDING, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germans crossed the border
by the carload in a cold, light rain Monday, including a young
couple who came directly from their wedding, still wearing formal
attire.
   West Germans who watched the stream of cars entering West
Germany from Czechoslovkia predicted many refugees would return
home if communist East Germany introduced enough reforms.
   The waiting line of vehicles was 400 yards long at the
Schirnding crossing in northeastern Bavaria.
   ``A lot of them will go back if there are true democratic
changes that create real trust in the government,'' said music
teacher Franz Meixner from Wuerzburg in central Bavaria. ``I
estimate it could be two-thirds.''
   Meixner, who is 60 and left East Berlin for the West in 1948,
said his sympathy went out to the newcomers.
   ``My neighbors say, `Why are they coming here?''' he said.
``Especially the young West Germans claim the refugees are taking
away jobs and apartments. I tell my neighbors they should go over
there and see how they like it.''
   Last month, East Germany announced an amnesty that appears to
allow the return of any of the tens of thousands who have fled
without exit visas.
   ADN, the official East German news agency, said late Monday more
than 23,000 citizens had left through Czechoslovakia in the
previous three days. They join more than 150,000 who have emigrated
legally, escaped or failed to return from approved trips abroad
this year.
   West German officials have had to requisition temporary shelter
and demands have arisen that the flow of refugees be ended.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said political and economic reform is needed
in East Germany to keep its people home.
   Gabi Engmann, standing in the rain at the Schirnding crossing,
said she also believed many refugees would return if reforms came
to pass.
   In West Germany, ``they will certainly find there is a real
housing shortage, said the 52-year-old hairdresser from Wunsiedel.
   Kohl's government has have promised a major building program to
ease the shortage, and is recommending the use of vacant offices as
apartments.
   Manfred Mueller, 59, of nearby Hof, believed the pull on
refugees would be strong if conditions improved in East Germany.
``Just consider how much they left behind _ friends, relatives and
almost all their belongings.''
   Government officials estimated late last month that about
one-third of East Germans who had arrived since September still
were unemployed.
   Ethnic Germans also arew arriving from elsewhere.
   Red Cross officials say they expect up to 400,000 from the
Soviet Union and other East European countries this year.
   ARD-TV said the East Germans were arriving with ``huge hopes.''
It showed the couple crossing the border in their wedding finery.
   Sylvio Lube, 21, rode his motorcycle through cold rain rain to
Schirnding from Koenigswusterhausen, just south of East Berlin.
   ``When you have a goal, you can get used to the cold,'' the
shivering factory worker said after the 180-mile ride.
   He said he left his 21-year-old wife, Janette, and their two
small children, but ``I'm hoping to get them out later. All I had
was this motorcycle to leave with. We don't even own a car.''

<HEAD>Largest Labor Federation Calls For Nationwide Beer Boycott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the main black
labor federation Monday called for a beer boycott by consumers and
tavern owners to support workers on a four-week strike against the
country's beer monopoly.
   ``The boycott will not end until the demands of the workers are
met,'' said a statement issued by Johannesburg-area officials of
the Congress of South African Trade Unions, which claims 1 million
members.
   About 6,000 employees of privately owned South African Breweries
went on strike to press for a wage increase of 38 percent. The
company has refused to revise its offer of a 16 percent raise, and
says it will agree to mediation on other contract matters only if
the wage dispute is left off the agenda.
   Throughout the strike, the company has accused the Food and
Allied Workers Union of sanctioning violence against employees who
continued to work. One workers's house was burned down, and armed
guards were placed aboard some delivery trucks after a driver was
killed in Durban.
   The trade union congress, in its boycott call, urged ``all our
people to conduct this campaign in a peaceful and disciplined
method.''
   Anticipating the possibility of a boycott, the company last week
expressed concern that it would be enforced through coercion.
   ``People are being asked to lose their jobs and their
livelihoods in solidarity with peple who are refusing one of the
highest wage packages in the country,'' the company said.
   The company's wage offer would raise monthly pay for its
lowest-paid workers to about $400. That is more than twice the
minimum wage for members of the National Union of Mineworkers, the
largest black union.
   Blacks consume about 80 percent of South Africa's beer, and the
national association of black tavern owners has agreed to support
the boycott. However, the main association of black liquor store
outlets has declined to do so, saying their customers would simply
turn to white-owned stores.
   South African Breweries produces all four leading beer brands in
South Africa, which imports relatively small quantities of beer
from abroad. The strike has affected seven of the company's 11
breweries, but production has continued and no reports of severe
shortages have surfaced yet as summer approaches.
   There have been no contract negotations since the strike began,
although the union last week suggested the two sides agree to
mediation.

   Vladimir Horowitz, the legendary pianist who
dazzled the world for 60 years, was mourned upon his death as the
20th century's titan of the keyboard whose passing created a void
that can never be filled.
   The Russian-born virtuoso, who brought ``controlled thunder'' to
the piano and was a last link to the 19th century masters, died
Sunday at 85 in his Upper East Side home. Funeral services were set
for Friday at the famous La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy.
   Horowitz left his native Russia in 1925 and came to the United
States in 1928, playing his first American concert seven days later.
   He was an instant success.
   ``When he played, he'd turn on the current and it would hit sort
of like a shockwave,'' said Morton Gould, president of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``His performance had
that unique electricity that was magical.''
   ``He touched every musician who ever heard him,'' said pianist
Murray Perahia, who was at the home when Horowitz died. ``He knew
all the repertory and could play pieces he hadn't done in 20
years.''
   Horowitz had been in good health and as recently as last week
was recording in his living room, said his manager, Peter Gelb.
Less than three weeks ago, hundreds of admirers filled a record
store for an album-signing session.
   His last performances were in 1987 in Berlin, Hamburg, West
Germany, and Amsterdam, Netherlands, Gelb said. The year before, he
had returned to Moscow for the first time in 61 years for an
emotional concert shown on American television.
   His final American performances were in the fall of 1986, Gelb
said, when he played at New York's Lincoln Center and the reopening
of the refurbished Carnegie Hall.
   His awards included the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest
civilian award in 1986, the Legion of Honor from France and Italy's
Order of Merit. He also was the recipient of more than 20 Grammy
awards.
   He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Wanda, daughter of the
late conductor, Arturo Toscanini. Visitation was set for Tuesday
afternoon in New York, and then the body would be flown to Italy
for the service at La Scala, a spokeswoman for Gelb said today. He
will be buried in the Toscanini family plot in Milan, Gelb said.
   In a letter of condolence to Mrs. Horowitz, composer-conductor
Leonard Bernstein called the temperamental pianist ``a super
musician with all the mortal fallibilities such geniuses have.''
   Referring to Horowitz's occasional long withdrawals from
performance, Bernstein wrote that Mrs. Horowitz cared for him and
``returned him to us time and again refreshed, renewed, and ever
greater.''
   ``The greatest legend of the piano in the 20th century is dead
and his death leaves a vacuum which probably can never be filled,''
lamented Sir Georg Solti, the Chicago Symphony's music director.
   Pianist Emanuel Ax said an audience could feel Horowitz' energy
when he performed.
   ``There was the sense of an unbelievable energy being harnessed,
and the feeling that if he ever let it go, it would burn up the
hall,'' Ax said.
   Pianist Andre Watts said, ``It would be hard to come up with an
equivalent. There isn't another Horowitz. Thank God for
recordings.''
   Watts also said that Horowitz during a performance was ``like a
demon barely under control out there on the stage.''
   President Carter in 1978 called Horowitz a ``national treasure.''
   Horowitz played the White House three times _ first at Herbert
Hoover's request, second at Carter's, and the third for
then-President Reagan.
   Roman Popadiuk, deputy White House press secretary, said in a
statement:
   ``We are saddened at the loss of this world-renowned musician.
We extend our sympathies to his family. His musical legacy will
continue to live on.''
   Horowitz, whose sartorial trademark was a bow tie, was known for
his intense, electric performances, his technique and skill, his
rich interpretations, speed and a power described as ``controlled
thunder.''
   In addition to his playing, audiences were charmed by
eccentricities _ his impish smiles and twinkling eyes. He traveled
with his Steinway grand piano.
   He called playing the piano as ``the coordination of mind, heart
and finger,'' with emotion the key.
   ``The brain is the control of emotion; there has to be something
to be controlled. The heart is the guide, the brain is the control;
what comes out had to have both,'' he once said.
   He often interrupted his career for long periods _ 1936 to 1938,
from 1953 to 1965, from 1968 to 1974 and from 1983 to 1985.
   He continued to make records during the second retirement and
served as mentor to five concert pianists who later would speak of
the complex relationship that grew between them and their volatile
teacher.
   The ``demon inside me'' that urged him to do better, and a
desire to perform in public again, brought him back to the stage
when he was 61 with what critics said was a new maturity and a
wider range.
   The pace of his concerts slowed as he grew older, but his
reputation was undiminished.
   ``No matter how difficult and complicated the piece, Horowitz
would make it sound easy,'' The New York Times' Harold C. Schonberg
once wrote.
   Horowitz was born Vladimir Gorowicz on Oct. 1, 1904, on Kiev's
Music Street. His father, Simeon, was a prosperous engineer
impoverished by the Russian revolution. His mother, Sophie Bodik,
was an amateur pianist who inspired such a love of music in her
three children that daughter Regina also became a concert pianist
and son Georg a violin teacher.
   Horowitz was given piano lessons at age 6. Within three years,
he shocked his parents by learning all the Rachmaninoff pieces in
the family library and all the piano scores of Wagner's operas. He
attended the Kiev Conservatory, where from age 12 to 16 he studied
piano and composition under Felix Blumenfeld.
   He made his concert debut at 19, seeking to earn money for his
family.
   Horowitz left the Soviet Union on a six-month visa to study in
the West. Instead of studying, he began a two-year European tour
that won him acclaim. It was during that tour, when he played in
Berlin, that he changed his name to Horowitz.
   In 1933, he was chosen as solo for Toscanini's last in a series
of Beethoven concerts. Toscanini also introduced Horowitz to his
daughter, and they were soon married.
   Horowitz, who became a U.S. citizen that year, was a longtime
critic of the Soviet system _ ``I don't like the Russian approach
to music, to art, to anything'' _ and repeatedly said he would
never return.
   But he did return in 1986.
   The Soviets obviously had not forgotten him; determined fans
rushed police and stormed his Moscow concert and open rehearsal. It
was the most talked-about musical event in the Soviet Union in
years.
   Horowitz' only rival for acclaim and popularity was Artur
Rubinstein, who died in 1982. Rubinstein conceded that Horowitz was
the better pianist, but not the better musician.
   ``I am a 19th-century Romantic,'' Horowitz once said. ``I am the
last.''

<HEAD>Communist Party Plenum Meets to Set Economic Course</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee, holding
its first plenary session since it purged reform leader Zhao Ziyang
in June, convenes this week to tighten the lock on the nation's
economic and political policies.
   The plenum is expected to endorse a three-year program,
advocated by hard-line Premier Li Peng, reasserting central
controls over the economy. It may also fill vacancies in the
party's decision-making Politburo with supporters of the
conservative line.
   As is usually the case, there has been no official announcement
on the plenum, but East European sources said it would begin Monday
and run for two or three days.
   Party leaders were reported to have met in a secret last week to
map out the decisions to be made at the 5th Plenary Session of the
13th Central Committee.
   The plenum, consisting of 175 Central Committee members and 108
alternates, will focus on the economic prospectus that many fear
could be a setback for China's 10-year course of market-oriented
reforms.
   Premier Li and planning chief Yao Yilin are believed to be
pushing for retrenchment policies that will revive the primacy of
central planning, restore the leadership of party functionaries in
factories and economic planning departments, and limit the growth
of collective and private enterprise.
   The plan is expected to cast aside price reforms and other
structural changes while the government strives to slow down
economic growth, control inflation and bring centralized order into
the economy in the next three years.
   There have been indications, though, of resistance to the
conservative line from pro-reform economists and officials from
coastal provinces whose regions have flourished under
decentralization and introduction of market-style economies.
   The plenum was originally expected to convene in October but
apparently was delayed because of differences over how far to push
economic retrenchment.
   Differences may also remain over two other key issues: the
handling of disgraced former party chief Zhao Ziyang and the
retirement of senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   At the June 23-24 plenum, Zhao was purged from all his party
posts and accused of abetting the pro-democracy demonstrations that
were crushed in Beijing by military force on June 3-4.
   He has been under virtual house arrest since then, and Chinese
leaders have suggested he could be put on trial for crimes against
the state.
   Recent statements, however, indicate the plenum won't bring
criminal charges against the former protege of Deng. It is also not
clear whether the plenum will single out other Zhao supporters for
censure or punishment.
   The plenum may also put off a decision on Deng's retirement from
his last official post, as chairman of the Central Military
Commission. Deng is 85.
   The post is one of the most powerful in China's political
hierarchy, and the likely candidate is Zhao's successor, new party
General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Deng has anointed the 63-year-old
ex-Shanghai party boss as his heir-apparent, and Jiang needs the
military ties to bolster his weak credentials as a national leader.
   However, President Yang Shangkun, one of the masterminds of the
June military crackdown, also is bidding to head the military
commission. Yang, 82, is permanent vice chairman of the military
commission.
   But there is reported concern that Yang is moving to establish a
family dynasty within the military. Yang's younger brother, Yang
Baibing, heads the army General Political Department, his
son-in-law Chi Haotian is chief of staff, and his nephew, Yang
Jianhua, is commander of the 27th Army that spearheaded the bloody
attack on Beijing in June.
   Deng remains China's strongest man despite his retirement from
most of his official duties. His departure from the military
commission would not change that, although the choice of his
successor could influence the outcome of the power struggle
expected to occur after Deng's death.
   The plenum may name new members of the party Politburo, which is
down to 14 members after the loss of three reformists.
   Former party chief Hu Yaobang, who was fired from his job but
remained on the Politburo after 1986-87 student demonstrations,
died in April, sparking the the seven-week pro-democracy movement.
Zhao was removed from the Politburo in June along with Hu Qili,
another leading advocated of reform.

<HEAD>Nixon Dines at White House to Report on China Trip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush held an unannounced dinner at
the White House with former President Nixon, who is urging the
United States and China to restore good relations despite Beijing's
military crackdown on pro-democracy forces.
   Despite Nixon's appeal, the White House indicated it was not
ready to change its approach, which includes suspension of all
high-level official contacts.
   Nixon spent two hours at the White House on Sunday evening,
reporting on his trip to China and meetings with senior leaders,
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.
   Fitzwater also revealed Bush had summoned officials from the
CIA, State Department and National Security Council to Camp David
on Saturday for the first in a series of briefings for his summit
in December with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It was a staff session primarily to assess the situation in
the Soviet Union and to consider many of the political and economic
issues that are now facing President Gorbachev,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the meeting was not designed to produce new initiatives
toward the Soviet Union and was the first of many pre-summit
sessions.
   ``They're simply to give him a full explanation and opinion
package from all sides of all issues before he goes, so he's
thoroughly acquainted with Soviet actions, Soviet history, issues
of interest to the United States. ..., Fitzwater said.
   Bush also discussed policy toward the Soviet Union over lunch
Monday with Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was the national security
adviser to President Carter.
   Fitzwater said other meetings will include experts from outside
government.
   Nixon's trip to China put a fresh spotlight on the tensions
between Washington and Beijing since June's bloody repression of
the pro-democracy movement in China.
   Despite Nixon's call for restoration of relations, Fitzwater
indicated the United States was taking a more cautious approach.
   ``We do see some changes in China in terms of them reaching out
to other parts of the world, but at this point, we have not
determined that the time is right to make very dramatic changes,''
he said.
   Fitzwater added, ``The issue that would change our position are
changes and actions in China.''
   Asked if Bush and Nixon disagreed over strategy toward China,
Fitzwater said, ``I wouldn't want to suggest agreement or
disagreement or suggest anything of the kind. Simply, we just
aren't willing to describe the former president's remarks. He can
do that fine.''
   The press spokesman said, ``Our general policy has not changed
... We do want to preserve the relationship, and that as events
proceed, we will continue to consider possible actions that would
change our relationship.''
   Nixon, traveling as a private citizen at the invitation of the
government, was the most prominent American to visit China since
the crackdown.
   In Beijing, Nixon had said the two powers should return to the
formula of 1972, the year of Nixon's historic door-opening visit to
China, ``acknowledging our profound differences while realistically
identifying and pursuing our common interests.''
   After Sunday night's dinner at the White House, Nixon returned
to New York.
   Other dinner guests included Vice President Dan Quayle, Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft, Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates, CIA
Director William Webster, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
and Michel Oksenberg, a China scholar and a member of Nixon's
entourage.
   Bush's China policy won support Monday from another former
president, Jimmy Carter, who told a group of reporters in
Washington that he believes the sanctions imposed on China are just
about right.
   Noting China's extreme sensitivity to interference by
foreigners, Carter said: ``I think all of us should help
reintegrate China in the world community without relinquishing our
commitment to basic human rights.''

<HEAD>Tribal Use of Peyote Argued Before Supreme Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was told Monday that
establishing a constitutional right to take peyote in religious
ceremonies would allow use of a dangerous hallucinogenic drug and
could lead to broader drug use.
   ``It can cause psychotic reactions in a small number of users,''
Oregon Attorney General David Frohnmayer said about peyote. ``It is
very risky.''
   However, Craig J. Dorsay argued that the survival of the Native
American Church would be threatened if Oregon officials are allowed
to deny unemployment compensation to two men fired for using peyote
at religious ceremonies.
   Dorsay, who represents the two fired workers, said small amounts
of peyote had been used in religious ceremonies for hundreds of
years with practically no evidence of harm. Alcohol generally is
more dangerous to Indians, he said.
   Frohnmayer said that if the drug is permitted in church
ceremonies, ``it will be a wedge'' for drug use by other religious
groups, citing a pending state case involving the use of marijuana.
   When asked by Justice Antonin Scalia if states may ban snake
handling as a religious practice, Dorsay said, ``I don't think
there's a dispute that rattlesnakes can cause harm. Peyote misuse
is dangerous,'' not its controlled use in religious ceremonies.
   The justices heard 60 minutes of arguments and are expected to
announce a ruling by July. After Monday's court session, members of
the Native American Church conducted a religious ceremony on the
grounds of the Capitol across the street from the court.
   Peyote was not part of the ceremony. Leaders burned leaves and
bits of cedar and prayed for the future of the church.
   The case is before the nation's highest court for the second
time. The justices last year sent it back to the Oregon Supreme
Court to determine whether the religious use of peyote was a crime
in that state.
   The state court declined to answer that question and once again
ruled that Oregon may not deny unemployment benefits for use of
peyote in a religious ceremony.
   The fired workers, Galen W. Black and Alfred L. Smith, were
counselors with the Douglas County, Ore., Council on Alcohol and
Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment.
   After each took small amounts of peyote as part of a church
sacrament, they were fired for violating company policy.
   Peyote, a cactus ``button'' containing the hallucinogen
mescaline, is an illegal drug under Oregon law.
   But high court members said Monday that state officials
apparently don't try to ban peyote use on Indian reservations.
   ``Isn't it likely there will continue to be exemptions (from
criminal laws) for peyote use'' regardless of how the court rules,
Justice John Paul Stevens suggested.
   The opposing lawyers disputed whether the amounts taken by Black
and Smith at the church services could cause dangerous
hallucinations.
   Smith, a Klamath Indian, is an alcoholic who has not used
alcohol since 1957. He counseled alcoholics for the county agency.
   Black is not an Indian. He worked for the agency counseling drug
users while he was recovering from drug and alcohol abuse.
   The rehabilitation program has changed its policy, agreeing not
to fire employees for the sacramental use of peyote.
   The case is Employment Division vs. Smith, 88-1213.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leaders Appeal For Reconciliation on Eve of Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of a 23-year guerrilla war
against South African rule appealed for reconciliation Monday on
the eve of the election that will bring independence to Namibia
after more than a century of foreign rule.
   ``I call on all Namibians ... to forget the past and unite
together to overthrow the yoke of colonialism,'' said Andimba Toivo
ja Toivo, secretary general of the South-West Africa People's
Organization.
   SWAPO is favored to outpoll nine other parties in a five-day,
United Nations-supervised election starting Tuesday for 72 seats in
an assembly that will draft a constitution for independent Namibia.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk urged Namibians to ``cast
your vote in the interest of peace and prosperity.''
   ``The strife and bitterness, the mistrust and misunderstandings
of the past must be put behind us,'' he said.
   An airplane chartered by SWAPO's main rival, the Democratic
Turnhalle Alliance, to broadcast political messages was forced down
by gunfire Monday, but otherwise authorities reported calm
throughout the arid, sparsely populated territory.
   Police said the single-engine plane crash-landed and caught fire
after being hit by bullets over the northern region of Kavango. The
two men aboard the plane were not seriously hurt, and a hunt for
the attackers was launched, police said.
   Fred Eckhard, chief spokesman for the U.N. monitoring force,
said officials were nervous because ``there is a deep-seated mutual
distrust on the part of supporters of different parties.''
   ``The peace is a fragile peace,'' Eckhard said.
   Posters and TV advertisements financed by U.N. and territorial
officials have been stressing that ballots will be secret and
urging the 701,453 registered voters to ``vote without fear.''
   SWAPO is the overwhelming front-runner, and the key question is
whether it will win two-thirds of the votes, which would allow it
to draft a constitution without compromising with other parties.
   ``The day has finally arrived when Nambians will vote for
freedom,'' said SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, who spent 30 years in
exile.
   Both Nujoma and de Klerk said they were prepared to accept the
results of the election, regardless of the outcome, as long as the
U.N.'s chief representative, Martti Ahtisaari, certified that the
voting was free and fair.
   Nujoma said ``Namibian patriots'' of other parties would be
invited to join a SWAPO-led government. But he ruled out a role for
Dirk Mudge, a white moderate who is the best-known leader of the
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.
   The alliance is a multiracial coalition which participated in a
South African-installed transitional government.
   Nambia was colonized by Germany in 1884, and captured by South
Africa in 1915. South Africa agreed last year to grant independence
as part of a regional treaty that also calls for the phased
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.
   Last week, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha raised the
possibility of delaying the elections when he alleged that SWAPO
guerrillas had mobilized along the Angola-Namibian border for a
treaty-breaking incursion into the territory. Botha later admitted
his charge was based on false radio messages and said prospects for
free and fair elections were good.
   Some opposition politicians and newspapers in South Africa have
demanded Botha's resignation, and there have been calls for an
investigation of the possibility that he was duped by right-wing
elements in the military who sought to undermine the Namibian
elections.
   U.N. election officials said votes will be cast at 358 polling
stations, including 143 mobile booths sent to remote areas. Final
results are expected by the end of next week.
   The voting will be monitored by 1,695 U.N. supervisers, along
with observers from at least 25 foreign countries and
representatives of the Namibian political parties.
   The U.N. force will remain in Namibia until independence,
expected early next year. But Eckhard said other U.N. agencies
would take over trying to track down more than 300 missing
Namibians who allegedly were detained by SWAPO at prison camps in
Angola and Zambia.
   At the United Nations on Monday, Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar noted that there have been 120,000 gun permits issued
and said he was concerned about a possible outbreak of violence
after the election.
   ``While, at this time, there have been marked improvements in
the security situation on the eve of the election, I remain
vigilant to the possibility of a deterioration in the field of law
and order,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian today signed a
12-bill earthquake relief package, including a temporary sales tax
hike to raise $800 million.
   ``We're going to do whatever is necessary to restore the lives
and the homes of the people who were victims of this quake,''
Deukmejian said as he began signing the bills.
   As Mayor Art Agnos and a dozen legislators looked on, Deukmejian
signed the relief package at 11:45 a.m. after riding a ferry boat
across the San Francisco Bay from Oakland.
   Although state lawmakers approved the temporary sales tax
increase for earthquake relief, the package was nearly derailed by
partisan bickering.
   Legislators completed a hectic three-day special session over
the weekend, but only after rejecting claims that the sales tax
hike was insufficient or premature.
   The Oct. 17 quake killed at least 66, injured 3,000 and did an
estimated $7 billion damage in Northern California. The levy,
intended to raise $800 million, would take effect Dec. 1.
   ``I congratulate the Legislature on its quick action on the
earthquake relief package to assist the earthquake victims in
rebuilding their lives, businesses and communities,'' Deukmejian
said.
   State and federal aid, the Republican governor said, ``should
provide the necessary resources in order to restore some semblance
of normalcy in the Bay area.''
   Some legislators of both parties criticized the plan, which
raises the sales tax to as much as 7 cents on the dollar, depending
on local rates. Deukmejian also plans to tap the state reserve for
$200 million.
   Some lawmakers insisted the cost of the earthquake repairs will
be much higher than the total $4.25 billion in approved federal aid
and state funds.
   ``It's going to be closer to $10 billion, believe me,'' said
Sen. Nicholas Petris, a Democrat who urged a half-cent sales tax
increase. ``This is no time to be pandering to the pockets of the
people.''
   The tax hike, opposed by most Republicans in the Assembly,
passed the lower house Saturday with two votes to spare. It passed
the Senate by 34-2.
   ``Why would anyone want to take advantage of this disaster to
raise taxes?'' asked Assemblyman Pat Nolan, a conservative
Republican who tried to block the measure.
   In other quake developments:
   _Engineers plan to create earthquake conditions on a section of
Oakland's Interstate 880 with hydraulic jacks and a massive
spinning device in an experiment to help freeway designers learn to
protect highways from quakes.
   A section near the stretch of double-decked freeway that
collapsed in the quake will be deliberately felled in the test
sometime before Christmas, said James E. Roberts, chief of the
structural division of the state Department of Transportation. Most
of the quake's victims were crushed between the freeway's decks.
   _A mild aftershock struck the San Francisco Bay area Sunday
morning, but authorities said there were no reports of damage or
injuries. The aftershock, on the San Andreas Fault and centered 8
miles east of Santa Cruz, some 60 miles south of San Francisco,
registered 4.0 on the Richter scale, said Pat Jorgenson, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey.
   _Hispanic leaders and Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., complained
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has responded
inadequately to the needs of Spanish-speaking residents left
homeless by the quake. At the public meeting Saturday in Santa
Cruz, FEMA official Bob Stevens responded that the agency ran out
of Spanish-language applications while helping Puerto Rico
residents after Hurricane Hugo.
   _The National Football League on Sunday announced a $1 million
donation to the earthquake relief effort on behalf of the 28 teams'
owners. San Francisco 49ers owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. will add
a $250,000 contribution on behalf of his family, the NFL said.

<TEXT>
   L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and David Dinkins of New York
campaigned to the finish line Monday in drives to shatter race
barriers, one aiming to become America's first black elected
governor and the other the first black mayor of the nation's
largest city.
   Democratic Rep. James Florio and underdog GOP Rep. James Courter
sought last-minute support in New Jersey's gubernatorial contest,
the other high-profile race in Tuesday's off-year elections that
will be closely watched for signs of changing voter sentiment on
abortion.
   Ballots were also studded with hundreds of mayoral races,
contests for other city and county offices and referendums.
   J. Marshall Coleman, discounting polls that showed him trailing
Wilder in Virginia, told a rally ``the undecideds are breaking our
way. ... We're absolutely on the eve of a great victory.''
   But Wilder, the lieutenant governor and grandson of freed
slaves, countered that chances were ``exceedingly good'' he would
win and lead a statewide Democratic sweep of three top offices.
   There was no letup in Republican Rudolph Giuliani's attacks on
Manhattan Borough President Dinkins, who has admitted failing to
file income tax returns for four years two decades ago and has
faced questions about a stock transfer to his son.
   ``David Dinkins has a history of getting away with things that
others don't get away with. I don't know why,'' said Giuliani, a
former U.S. attorney and underdog in the New York mayoral race.
``He is less than candid. He hides, he evades.''
   Dinkins replied that his Republican rival entered the race like
a ``knight in shining armor on a white charger. I suggest that the
armor is a bit tarnished and that charger is no longer white.''
   Elsewhere on the ballot, 11 Democrats went through their final
campaign paces in Houston, where they were vying to fill the
unexpired term of the late Democratic Rep. Mickey Leland.
   New York aside, big city election campaigns were winding up in
Detroit, Houston and Miami, where incumbents Coleman Young, Kathy
Whitmire and Xavier Suarez sought new terms.
   Cleveland's unusually nasty mayoral campaign neared an end,
pitting City Council President George Forbes against state Sen.
Michael R. White.
   Voters in 10 states will decide 56 referendums on Tuesday.
   Among them was Michigan, deciding the fate of two competing
plans to raise the state sales tax for education. One called for a
halfpenny increase and the other a two-cent rise.
   In others, a proposal to raise $115 million for a new stadium
for the San Francisco Giants faced a tough fight in light of huge
costs from earthquake damage, while residents of Greensboro, N.C.,
where cigarette manufacturing is big business, were deciding
whether to limit public smoking.
   Democrats were hoping for a three-race sweep in Virginia, New
Jersey and New York City to buoy the party in advance of 1990
elections that will fill 34 Senate seats, 36 governorships and 435
House seats.
   President Bush campaigned for Republican candidates in all three
races.
   Republicans said the results would prove of little use in
handicapping next year's campaign. But all three races,
particularly Virginia, were being watched closely for signs of
shifting views on abortion.
   Wilder has made Coleman's opposition to abortion a cornerstone
of his campaign, challenging a decade of political wisdom that said
pro-choice candidates should avoid the issue.
   Pro-choice and right-to-life groups also poured thousands of
dollars into television commercials for Wilder and Coleman.
   Giuliani and Courter both modified their opposition to abortion
during the campaign, the first since the Supreme Court ruling last
summer permitting states to impose greater restrictions.
   Ironically, perhaps, abortion largely overshadowed race in the
campaign in Virginia, once the capital of the Confederacy. Coleman
broached the subject indirectly late last week when he said Wilder
was benefiting from a ``double standard'' in press coverage.
   Florio, loser in two previous gubernatorial campaigns, spent the
final hours saying he was guarding against overconfidence, but also
appealing for election of enough Democrats to give his party a
majority in the State Assembly. The GOP holds a two-seat majority.
   Courter scheduled several stops during the final day of his
campaign, culminating with a ``Favorite Son'' rally at home in
Warren County.
   Wilder and Coleman both spent their final day of campaigning in
the company of popular Virginians.
   Coleman made his rounds with Sen. John Warner at his side and
stressed his law enforcement experience as the state's former
attorney general and his opposition to higher taxes.
   Wilder was accompanied by Gov. Gerald Baliles and Sen. Charles
Robb, a former governor, to accentuate his claim to being the heir
to eight successive years of Democratic government.

<TEXT>
   Voters Monday faced the possibility of
going to the polls for the third time this year after elections
failed to give any party a clear governing mandate.
   According to the constitution, President Christos Sartzetakis
must call elections within 30 days if political leaders fail to
form a viable government that can win a parliamentary vote of
confidence.
   Constantine Mitsotakis' conservative New Democracy party won
Sunday's election but fell three seats short of an absolute
majority of the 300-member unicameral Parliament.
   The Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, led by former
Premier Andreas Papandreou, came in second with 128 places and the
Coaliton of the Left and Progress led by Communist leader Harilaos
Florakis took 21 seats.
   The remaining three seats went to independents, including a
leftist, a Greek Moslem and an environmentalist, for the first time
in the nation's political history.
   In the previous Parliament elected in June, New Democracy
controlled 145 seats, PASOK 125 places and the Coalition 28, with
two seats going to independents. New Democracy and the Coalition
governed together for three months following those elections with
the sole intention of investigating scandals involving the
Papandreou government.
   The political impasse froze decisions on how to solve the
country's economic crisis and negotiations on the continued
presence of U.S. bases in Greece.
   A Greek-U.S. defense accord expired last year and negotiations
on renewing it were suspended in June. If no agreement is reached
with a new government, the United States has until May 1990 to
close the four major military installations.
   New Democracy party officials said Mitsotakis, 71, would confer
with Sartzetakis at the presidential palace on Tuesday where he
would seek a mandate to form a government. If he failed to do so,
then Papandreou, 70, would be given his chance followed by Florakis.
   The chances for the conservatives to succeed appeared slim since
PASOK and the Coalition said that differences with New Democracy in
ideology and foreign and domestic policy issues could not be
bridged.
   Leaders of the Coalition rejected Papandreou's bid to form a
government after the June 18 elections ended in a hung Parliament.
   The Athens Stock Exchange reacted sharply to the election
results. Its General Index, which gives an overall picture of the
daily value of the shares traded, was down 8.9 percent for the day.
   The sharp drop in share values reflected the anxiety felt by
many business leaders because of Greece's worsening economy which
cannot be revived without unpopular measures.
   When the socialists lost the June vote, ending eight years in
office, they had built up a $58 billion public debt, which included
$20 billion owed abroad.
   Mitsotakis campaigned on a program of less government
interference in the economy and closer ties to the United States.
Papandreou pledged to double farmers' pensions and defend the
welfare state if elected.

   Most senior citizens would see their total
health insurance costs rise if Congress repealed Medicare's
catastrophic care program, because private ``medigap'' premiums
would go up, a congressman said Monday.
   Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., released a government
survey of 20 private insurers that estimated the average medigap
premium would rise an extra 15.4 percent next year if the
catastrophic package were repealed. Medigap policies are the
supplemental private insurance that people buy to fill gaps in
their Medicare coverage.
   Stark, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on
health, said that for at least 20 million people, the increases in
medigap premiums would exceed the amount they would save in reduced
Medicare fees if the catastrophic package were scrapped.
   The survey by the General Accounting Office predicted the
average monthly medigap premium would rise from $58.71 this year to
$60.10 in 1990 because of rising health care costs. If the
catastrophic package were repealed, the average monthly premium
would rise to $69.35, according to the survey.
   ``These Medigap increases will hit those least able to afford it
_ those who are the poor and have modest income,'' Stark said.
``The evidence continues to mount that repeal has a price, a big
price to those 24 million seniors who have medigap policies.''
   Stark has been a big defender of the catastrophic program, which
offers expanded Medicare coverage against the high costs of serious
illness. He acknowledged that Congress is on the verge of rolling
back all or most of the program.
   The catastrophic package has drawn complaints from senior
citizens who argue its costs exceed its benefits. The program is
financed by higher Medicare premiums on all but the poorest
beneficiaries and a surtax that affects the 40 percent of elderly
Americans who pay more than $150 a year in income tax. The surtax
has been the main focus of the opposition.
   The Health Insurance Association of America last week estimated
medigap prices are likely to rise 7 percent to 12 percent in 1990
due to rising health costs. But it said the increases can be
expected to total 15 percent to 20 percent under a Senate-passed
plan to cut back part of the catastrophic package or 20 percent to
25 percent if Congress repeals the whole program.

   A 32-year-old man convicted in the
strangling of four prostitutes and sent to death row has died in
prison of natural causes, a prison spokesman said Monday.
   Louis Craine died Friday, said Lt. Cal White, a spokesman for
the San Quentin prison who provided no further information on the
cause of death.
   Craine arrived at the prison July 5 and was hospitalized later
that month, White said.
   Craine, a construction worker with a sixth-grade education and
an IQ of 69, was sentenced to death June 27, one day after the U.S.
Supreme Court cleared the way for executions of mentally retarded
killers.
   Superior Court Judge Janice Claire Croft rejected a defense plea
that would have allowed a life term for Craine, saying his victims
``fought frantically for their lives'' and he ``strangled each of
them to death and discarded their bodies in abandoned houses,
vacant lots and an alley like so much trash.''
   Craine was convicted April 26 of first-degree murder in the
stranglings of Loretta Perry, Gail M. Ficklin, Vivian Louise
Collins and Carolyn Barney. They were killed between August 1985
and May 1987.
   He was among four men arrested in the ``Southside Slayer''
attacks on 18 women. At one time, the murders were thought to be
the work of a single killer.
   Craine had admitted to three slayings after his arrest in 1987
but recanted on the witness stand.

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Monday passed a bill to
legalize abortions in this overhwelmingly Roman Catholic nation
after members of the governing party sided with the opposition to
support the measure.
   The bill, approved 102-73 by the Senate, still must be approved
by the parliament's 212-seat Chamber of Representatives before it
can become law. No date was set for debate to begin, and it could
be months before the bill makes it through the various committees
to the full chamber.
   Under current Belgian law, women who have abortions and doctors
who perform them face prison terms of up to 10 years in jail. The
law has not been strongly enforced in recent years, and public
opinion polls show most Belgians favor the right to abortion.
   Efforts to legalize the operation began in earnest in 1973.
Since then, 15 abortion bills have failed to win parliamentary
approval.
   The bill approved Monday would allow abortions to be performed
during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if a pregnant women was
judged by her doctor to be in a ``state of distress.''
   The vote capped a two-week debate in the 183-member Senate and
ignored an Oct. 31 ruling by the Council of State, a legal panel
that acts as a constitutional court, that the abortion bill
violates the penal code.
   The Council of State said ``state of distress'' was a subjective
notion without legal meaning. Its views are not binding, but they
rarely are ignored.
   The issue has split the center-left government of Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens, whose Christian Democrats oppose abortion.
Socialist members of the party favor the right to abortion.
   The government's theoretical majority in the Senate is 133, but
socialist senators, who can muster 65 votes, were joined by most
opposition members in favor of the bill. Their Christian Democratic
partners could only get the support of a few opposition members.
   Seven senators abstained.
   In the Chamber of Representatives, those in favor of the right
to abortion control about 62 percent of the seats.
   It is estimated that 15,000 illegal abortions take place in
Belgium each year. Hospitals and clinics list the operations as
``womb surgery'' to enable women to get reimbursed through social
security.

   Come Tuesday, look for Ralph Cox on the
second floor of the Spencer County Courthouse, screaming out a
window to an excitable election-day crowd.
   For 25 years, Cox has carried on a tradition dating to the early
years of the century by shouting election results from a courthouse
landing _ precinct by precinct.
   ``Sometimes I use a bullhorn when I can borrow one from the
elementary school,'' said the modern-day crier.
   Cox, 69, a retired school bus driver, farmer and funeral home
worker, said it was his ``roaring voice'' that got him the no-pay
job 25 years ago.
   The practice apparently stems from a provision in state law that
calls for election results to be ``announced distinctly and
audibly.''
   During elections, Cox waits in the county clerk's office until
several precincts are in, then grabs a handful of tally sheets and
heads for the second-floor of the courthouse.
   There, with a crowd often in the hundreds on the courthouse lawn
and beyond, he shouts the names of the leaders.
   People cheer and boo, depending on how things are going for
their favorite candidates in this county about 40 miles south of
Louisville.
   Several hundred people are expected Tuesday, mainly to hear the
results of a heated judge-executive's race.

   A planned Miss Russian American pageant may be
held somewhere else if Chicago officials don't decide soon on
sister cities.
   The Ukrainian capital of Kiev feels snubbed because Chicago has
yet to act on its 2-year-old request for such a partnership.
   Avis LaVelle, a spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Daley, said
Chicago's new cultural affairs commissioner is organizing a group
to implement pending sister city programs, but it soon will be too
late.
   Paul Wisniewski, a representative of Slavic American Cultural
Association Inc., said the people of Kiev ``have been given
excuses; the only thing they haven't seen are results.''
   Wisniewski's New York-based group is sponsoring the Miss Russian
American pageant, hoping to hold it next year in Chicago.
   A parallel pageant is to be held in Moscow and the Soviets
wanted the American counterpart to be in Chicago because they
believe that's where ``East meets West, the center of the U.S.A.,''
Wisniewski said.
   But as far as Kiev officials are concerned, if Chicago doesn't
make up its mind soon, the pageant could go to another U.S. city,
Wisniewski said.
   ``Naming a sister city is not a Herculean task. I don't know
what is taking them so long,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A top aide to Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile
Mariam pledged Monday to let his country's 16,000 Jews emigrate
freely but refused to say whether Israel promised to provide
military assistance in return.
   Kassa Kebede also said he had no knowledge of Israeli military
advisers reportedly working at an Ethiopian air force base.
   Kebede, Mengistu's political aide, said Ethiopia's renewal of
diplomatic relations with Israel, announced Friday, had ``nothing
to do with the emigration rights of Ethiopian Jews.''
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the agreement on the resumption of ties
included ``no linkage'' to the emigration question.
   Kebede said his government was willing to let the Jews go.
   ``There are Ethiopian Jews who would want to come and join their
families in Israel. They are most welcome. It is a basic human
right that has to be respected,'' he said.
   There are about 16,500 Ethiopian Jews in Israel. About 8,000 of
them were brought to Israel in a dramatic U.S.-assisted ``Operation
Moses'' airlift from November 1984 through January 1985 to join
earlier emigres. The airlift was halted after news of it leaked out
to the embarrassment of Addis Ababa's Marxist government.
   ``The government of Ethiopia was disappointed with the Operation
Moses, not because Ethiopian Jews came to Israel but because of the
publicity which was associated with that operation,'' Kebede said.
   Some 16,000 Jews remain in Ethiopia, and immigrant groups here
say as many as 18,000 people want to flee the African nation, which
has suffered from drought and civil war.
   Large numbers of Ethiopian Jews have continued to emigrate to
Israel in the past two years, Kebede said, declining to provide a
figure.
   Foreign reports said Ethiopian Jews are receiving exit visas at
the Swedish embassy in Addis Ababa.
   Kebede dismissed Israeli hopes of a renewed airlift and said
emigration would continue in its present form.
   Speaking at a news conference with Israel's Deputy Foreign
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Kebede said Ethiopia's decision to
renew relations followed informal contacts since 1973.
   Ethiopia and Israel exchanged consulates in 1956, raising these
to embassy level in 1962. After the 1973 Middle East war, Ethiopia
and 27 other African nations broke ties with Israel in response to
a call from the Organization of African Unity.
   Israel now has relations with 11 African nations, Netanyahu said.
   The New York Times on Sunday quoted foreign diplomats in Addis
Ababa as saying Mengistu was seeking Israeli military assistance in
his struggle against Erithrean Moslem and Tigrean rebels after the
Soviet Union, his main weapons supplier so far, demanded a national
reconciliation.
   It also quoted the diplomats as saying Israeli military advisers
have been present for some time now at an Ethiopian air force base.
   ``I am not a military man and I do not know of any Israeli
military advisers in Ethiopia,'' Kebede said.
   Kebede, who has studied sociology and economy at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University in 1960-65 and speaks fluent Hebrew, declined to
say whether Israel has promised military aid.
   ``First come the relations, then we will discuss the products of
these relations,'' he said. ``We are not resuming relations because
we want something from Israel. The resumption of relations means
resumption of interdependence.''

<TEXT>
   The famed La Scala opera company called its
recent tour of the Soviet Union a ``bureaucratic inferno'' of
bribery and corruption and urged the Italian government Monday to
lodge an official protest.
   Alberto Rispoli, secretary-general of La Scala, said it was ``a
miracle'' the company was able to stage all its performances during
the Oct. 2-Nov. 4 tour in Moscow and Leningrad.
   La Scala officials said they had to pay bribes and offer gifts
to ensure the shows could go on.
   ``Every day we had to deliver something under the table for
being allowed to work,'' Rispoli said.
   Theater superintendent Carlo Maria Badini said he has asked the
Italian government to file a protest with the Soviets.
   He emphasized, however, that the incidents would not hamper
relations with the Soviets and that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will be welcome to visit La Scala during his Nov. 29-Dec. 1 trip to
Italy.
   Gorbachev, who is scheduled to travel to Milan to meet business
leaders, had expressed a desire to attend the opera. The regular
season opens Dec. 7, but there have been reports that Gorbachev
could attend a rehearsal of Verdi's ``Vespri Siciliani.''
   Gorbachev, an avid opera fan, attended a performance of La Scala
company at Moscow's Bolshoi theater last month.
   Sergio Escobar, Badini's assistant, said the performances went
on ``only through daily payoffs and gifts to corrupt officials.
This was the only way for getting what had been provided by the
original contract.''
   ``We were in the hands of a criminal organization,'' Escobar
added. ``It was a bureaucratic inferno.''
   ``Trucks disappeared during unloading or loading operations,''
said Rispoli. ``Every day we had to deliver something under the
table for being allowed to work. We even considered the possibility
of giving up and returning home. We succeeded in going on stage
every time. It was a miracle.''
   The La Scala officials did not go into details of the alleged
payments.
   Badini said the Italian company probably was the victim of an
ongoing dispute between Gosconcert, the state company that controls
and manages cultural performances in the Soviet Union, and the
Bolshoi, where La Scala performed most of its works.
   ``We were caught in the middle of a chaotic situation because
the forces opposing changes pursued by Gorbachev still are very
powerful in the world of art as well at the highest political
levels,'' Badini was quoted as saying by Milan's daily Corriere
della Sera.

   An explosion that killed at least 19 workers
at Phillips Petroleum Co.'s petrochemical complex near Houston was
``a disaster waiting to happen,'' a union official told a House
committee Monday.
   Officials of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International
Union blamed the Oct. 23 explosion in part on Phillips' practice of
using sub-contractor maintenance crews in the huge complex on the
Houston Ship Channel in Pasadena.
   ``We believe the evidence will show that this catastrophe was a
disaster waiting to happen,'' said union vice president Robert E.
Wages.
   Wages said that subcontract workers earn about 65 percent of
union wages.
   Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, questioned
Phillips officials repeatedly about the wisdom of using contract
labor.
   ``We are dealing with complexes of enormous potential danger ...
and instead of trying to build a stable workforce under one
management, providing them with uniform procedures of training,
evacuation, safety, etc., you're sort of pulling in people through
contracting outfits at a dollar savings, but potentially at a very
high cost in human lives,'' Lantos said.
   ``You're not dealing here with a catering operation. We are
dealing with life-threatening materials in enormous quantities.''
   Glenn A. Cox, president and chief operating officer of the
Bartlesville, Okla.-based company, said the facts of the accident
``speak very clearly'' to the question of how Phillips staffs its
plants.
   ``One of the key questions we have to address is how, in fact,
work is assigned _ who does work _ to make certain there is not a
compromise in safety in these facilities,'' Cox said.
   In addition to 19 confirmed dead, four people are missing and
six remain hospitalized. More than 100 others were injured in the
explosion that hurtled debris up to six miles.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen works of art worth about $17
million were stolen from the Riviera home of Pablo Picasso's
granddaughter in what police called one of the biggest art thefts
ever.
   Police declined to reveal the titles of the works, which were
stolen Sunday morning from Marina Picasso's villa in Cannes.
   Ms. Picasso was on vacation in Megeve at the time of the
break-in, which police said took place while a guard was out
shopping.
   Police estimated the value of the stolen artwork at $17 million,
and said it included two paintings by Henri Matisse, a bust by
Auguste Rodin and seven paintings by Picasso.
   Maurice Rheims, a Picasso expert who was appointed by the
government to help divide up the multibillion-dollar Picasso estate
after the painter's death in 1973, knew the collection and said he
thought the value estimate was low.
   ``I don't know what the thieves will do with the paintings,''
Rheims said. ``They all have been inventoried, catalogued and
photographed many times over. No serious art dealer or collector
would touch them.''
   An official at the Picasso Museum in Paris said the collection
was shown in 1980 in West Germany and Italy and described it as
``impressive.''
   ``If anyone tries to sell them, they're crazy,'' the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They would all be
known.''
   Ms. Picasso, who inherited the works from her grandfather,
returned to Cannes on Monday but declined to speak to reporters who
had gathered at the three-story villa.
   Police said they believed a single thief who was familiar with
the house entered it without using force. Investigators said a
sophisticated burglar alarm did not function and none of the five
guard dogs was disturbed.
   Ms. Picasso is the daughter of Paul Picasso and his first wife,
Emilienne. Paul, who was estranged from his father at the time of
his death, was Picasso's only child by his first wife, the
Russian-born dancer Olga Kokhlova.

<HEAD>Policeman Fabricated Story on Stabbing; Palestinian Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A paramilitary border policeman who claimed he
had been beaten and stabbed by Palestinians confessed Monday to
slashing himself with his own knife, a police spokeswoman said.
   Also Monday, soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian activist as
he tried to flee to Jordan, the army said.
   Yihye Amar, 18, a new recruit in the paramilitary border police,
slashed his arms in a lavatory in Tel Aviv's central bus station
Sunday after he realized he would be late returning to his military
base, said Billi Dahlberg, a spokeswoman for the border police.
   Amar, a member of the Druse sect, was returning from leave in
his village in northern Israel, Dahlberg said.
   She said Amar, covered with blood, cried out for help, saying he
had been attacked by Palestinians.
   He told police as he was being taken to a hospital that he had
been attacked by a bearded Arab wearing a keffiyah and an
accomplice. The keffiyah is widely regarded as a symbol of the
Palestinian uprising.
   He claimed he was rescued by an army officer who chased away the
Arabs before they stole his gun, Dahlberg said.
   She said police investigators became suspicious when they were
unable to find the officer or any other witnesses who saw the
attackers flee from the bathroom into the crowded bus station.
   When confronted by police, Amar confessed he had slashed himself
and fabricated the story.
   Dahlberg said the border police plans to take ``the necessary
steps against the policeman.''
   The border police are a paramilitary police force that is
primarily responsible for patrolling the occupied territories. The
force contains a disproportionate number of recruits from the Druse
sect and other minorities.
   In the continuing violence in the occupied territories, soldiers
shot and killed a Palestinian as he tried to fle with another Arab
across the Israeli border into Jordan, the army said.
   An army spokesman said soldiers on patrol spotted two Arabs
moving towards the border north of the settlement of Mehola, 40
miles northeast of Jerusalem, and opened fire, fatally wounding one
of the Palestinians.
   The army identified the dead Arab as Wail Mahmad Daoud Haj
Hassan, 20, of the West Bank town of Qalqilya. He had been wanted
for two years by security forces on suspicion of firebombing
Israeli cars and violently interrogating Arabs he suspected of
cooperating with Israel, according to the army.
   At least 141 Arabs accused of collaborating with Israeli
authorities have been killed by their fellow Palestinians since the
uprising began almost 23 months ago.
   An army spokesman said it is possible that his accomplice
succeeded in crossing the border.
   His death raises to 611 the number of Palestinians shot and
killed by Israeli troops or civilians in the uprising against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forty Israelis
also have died in the violence.

   Two teen-agers who stole a keg of beer from
a restaurant were nabbed when they returned a few hours later for a
tap to open the keg, police said.
   ``These guys broke into the restaurant ... and might have gotten
away with it,'' said Lt. Tom Brooks of the Pasco County Sheriff's
Office. ``But they went back because they decided they needed a
beer tap.''
   The boys, 15 and 16, were arrested early Sunday by sheriff's
deputies after they returned to Mario's Italian Restaurant &amp;
Pizzeria, officials said. The restaurant had closed about a
half-hour before the first break-in occurred.
   The juveniles, who were charged with burglary and possession of
burglary tools, were taken to the Juvenile Detention Center.

   A Solidarity candidate was elected mayor in
Poland's second-largest city Monday, the first time the independent
movement has taken control of a municipal government away from the
Communist Party.
   Waldemar Bohdanowicz defeated four other non-Communist
candidates in a secret ballot by the municipal People's Council,
ending a five-month impasse.
   With Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity journalist,
leading the first non-communist government in the East bloc and the
Communist Party's influence waning in factories, provincial and
municipal governments have remained the last bastion of communist
control.
   But that too will be challenged next year when fully democratic
elections for local councils are planned. Partially free voting in
June parliamentary elections led to defeat for Communist candidates
and overwhelming victories for those backed by Solidarity.
   Lodz, a textile manufacturing city of 850,000 people about 80
miles southwest of Warsaw, has been without a mayor since May 29,
when the previous Communist city president was ousted in a
no-confidence vote following complaints of poor management.
   An Oct. 11 bid to elect a replacement failed when the
Communist-dominated council refused to elect either of the two
Solidarity-aligned candidates put forth by Mazowiecki. The prime
minister earlier had declined to nominate either of two candidates
proposed by the communists.
   But after an Oct. 23 meeting among representatives of the
communists, Solidarity and other political groups, it was decided
to entrust the choice to Mazowiecki, who approved five nominees,
none from the party.
   Bohdanowicz, one of the two rejected Oct. 11, got through
Monday, receiving 110 out of 168 valid votes, according to the PAP
news agency.
   The prime minister must approve candidates for mayors before
they can be elected by the municipal councils.
   The Mazowiecki government, which assumed power in August, is
preparing to reform the system, allowing communities to select
their own representatives without interference from Warsaw.
   Bohdanowicz, 48, has been a Solidarity activist since the
independent movement was founded in 1980.
   He said he is ``proposing cooperation to everyone who desires
the good of Lodz.''

<TEXT>
   Four inmates filed a lawsuit Monday over
the use of handcuffs and shackles at the riot-torn Camp Hill state
prison, contending that inmates there are being inhumanely treated.
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court by the American
Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the inmates whose families had
asked the ACLU for for help. Named as defendant was David S. Owens
Jr., commissioner of the state Corrections Department.
   Judge Sylvia Rambo scheduled a hearing for Tuesday and ordered
the state to bring the four inmates to the federal building in the
morning so they can meet with their lawyer and be called as
witnesses in the hearing.
   ACLU legal director Stefan Presser asked the court for a
restraining order that would force the department to remove
handcuffs and shackles from inmates and would allow the prisoners
to meet with their lawyers.
   In his petition, Presser said more than 1,000 inmates, some clad
only in underwear, remained shackled in pairs inside cells. Many of
the inmates have been held that way since two nights of rioting at
the prison ended Oct. 27.
   ``I think it's torture. We do not treat animals this way,''
Presser said.
   The fiery rioting left more than a dozen buildings destroyed at
the prison five miles west of Harrisburg. Thirteen prison staffersls repeatedly
about the wisdom of using contract
labor.
   ``We are dealing with complexes of enormous potential danger ...
and instead of trying to build a stable workforce under one
management, providing them with uniform procedures of training,
evacuation, safety, etc., you're sort of pulling in people through
contracting outfits at a dollar savings, but potentially at a very
high cost in human lives,'' Lantos said.
   ``You're not dealing here with a catering operation. We are
dealing with life-threatening materials in enormous quantities.''
   Glenn A. Cox, president and chief operating officer of the
Bartlesville, Okla.-based company, said the facts of the accident
``speak very clearly'' to the question of how Phillips staffs its
plants.
   ``One of the key questions we have to address is how, in fact,
work is assigned _ who does work _ to make certain there is not a
compromise in safety in these facilities,'' Cox said.
   In addition to 19 confirmed dead, four people are missing and
six remain hospitalized. More than 100 others were injured in the
explosion that hurtled debris up to six miles.

   A man picked up his wife in a romantic
gesture in a hotel, but stumbled and dropped her over a railing and
she fell eight floors onto a restaurant table, police said.
   Deborah A. Schneider, 34, was in critical condition Monday with
two broken legs, a broken pelvis and internal injuries after the
fall Saturday night.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Greg Mills said no charges are being
contemplated.
   U.S. Army Maj. David P. Schneider, stationed at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., had picked up his wife to carry her to their
room Saturday night, said Kansas City police Officer Al Sauer.
   His wife began to fidget, and Schneider tripped and lost his
grip near a wooden railing 3-foot, 7 inches high overlooking the
hotel's lobby. Mrs. Schneider went over the railing backward and
fell 75 feet, landing on a table.
   ``I think that's what saved her life,'' Sauer said.
   Mills said the woman was wearing a fur coat, making it hard for
her husband to keep hold of her.
   No one was in the restaurant at the time of the accident.

   Troops moved into eastern Ampara
district Monday where rival Tamil factions fought a bloody battle
that left at least 47 people dead, the Defense Ministry reported.
   It said hundreds of soldiers, backed by armored vehicles, left
their barracks to impose order after the fighting Sunday in
Tampiluvil and Tamputte villages, 20 miles southeast of Ampara
city. Ampara is 125 miles east of Colombo.
   Military officials said about 250 guerrillas of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest and most militant group of Tamil
separatists, raided two military camps run by other Tamil
organizations and killed 41 men. The officials said at least six
Tamil Tigers were killed in the hourlong battle.
   The camps were set up by the Tamil National Army, a militia
organized by former rebels to try to maintain order.
   The military officials said 140 members of the Tamil National
Army and Civilian Volunteer Force were captured by the Tamil Tigers
and taken away. They said the Tamil Tigers also seized an arms
cache, including 100 rifles.
   Enraged by the raids, members of the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front grabbed two Tamil Tiger supporters
Sunday and shot them to death in Akkaraipattu, 10 miles southeast
of Ampara city.
   It was the first time government troops had been sent to Ampara
district in 27 months, according to the Defense Ministry. And
Sunday's fighting was the first major clash between Tamil groups
after Indian peacekeeping forces were removed from the district
last week.
   Government military units had been withdrawn from predominantly
Tamil areas in the north and east of this island nation when Indian
peacekeeping troops moved in under an agreement reached in July
1987. Under the accord the Tamils were to gain greater political
control in their areas and were to stop their war for a separate
homeland.
   The Tamil Tigers at first accepted the pact but then reneged and
began attacking the Indian troops. About 1,100 Indian soldiers have
been killed in the fighting. Under pressure from the Sri Lankan
government and Tamil rebels India agreed earlier this year to
withdraw its forces.
   An Indian diplomat, speaking with the condition of anonymity,
said the Ampara fighting will not delay the scheduled departure of
the remaining 36,000 Indian soldiers by Dec. 31.
   ``The renewed violence is a wholly internal affair now and can
be contained by the local administration supported by the federal
government,'' the diplomat said.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne issued a statement
saying, ``I have ordered the Sri Lankan army and police to move
into the Ampara district and maintain law and order and this is
being done right now.'' He toured the Ampara district Monday and
said, ``The situation is completely under control.''
   The Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front, formerly a
militant separatist group, accepted the Indian-brokered 1987 peace
pact and controls the government in Ampara.
   At least 10,000 Sri Lankas have been killed in the Tamil
separatist war that began in 1983.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, claim the Buddhist Sinhalese
majority discriminates againt them. Sinhalese form 75 percent of
Sri Lanka's population of 16 million and control the central
government and army. Tamils comprise 18 percent of the population.

   James Bellows, former managing editor of ``USA
Today on TV,'' has settled his $1.8 million lawsuit against the
company that makes the syndicated series, spokesmen said Monday.
   Neither Bellows' attorney, Michael Zweig, nor M.S. ``Bud''
Rukeyser, spokesman for GTG East, would disclose terms of the
settlement, but each described it as amicable.
   The company is a branch of GTG Entertainment, a co-venture of
former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker and the Gannett Co.
   The series, which premiered in September 1988 and initially was
carried on 156 stations, has suffered in the ratings. It now
appears on about 100 stations, Rukeyser said.
   Bellows, 66, hired under a two-year contract paying him $275,000
a year, took over in October 1988 and left in March to help develop
a new program for GTG. His lawsuit, filed Oct. 2 in U.S. District
Court, alleged he was fired Sept. 26 without cause, justification
or warning.
   Bellows said Monday he hasn't decided what he'll do next, but
plans to move back to Los Angeles next summer. He has lived in New
York since 1983.

   A half-million East Germans thronged the streets
of Leipzig in a hard, cold rain Monday night to demand free
elections and unlimited freedom to travel abroad.
   More than 135,000 people rallied in other cities, including
Schwerin, Halle, Cottbus, Dresden and Karl-Marx-Stadt, the news
agency reported.
   While East Germans at home protested, mass flight continued. The
official news agency ADN said 23,200 citizens had gone to West
Germany since the suspension of exit rules Saturday.
   Lutheran Church sources said some marchers in Leipzig shouted
``The Wall must go!'' _ demanding demolition of the Berlin Wall,
symbol of East German repression for three decades.
   ADN said banners demanding ``Free elections'' and ``Travel law
without restrictions'' waved above the crowd, and others challenged
Communist Party supremacy.
   It said ``several hundred thousand'' people took part in the
biggest rally so far in Leipzig, where some of the largest protests
of the pro-democracy campaign have been held.
   Michael Turek, a Lutheran pastor in the southern industrial city
of 650,000, said by telephone about 500,000 people marched. A rally
Saturday in East Berlin, where the crowd was estimated at 1
million, was the largest protest in the communist nation's 40-year
history.
   Members of New Forum, the largest pro-reform group, addressed
the crowd in Leipzig, ADN said.
   Protests have become Monday night events in Leipzig. Crowds at
the last two were estimated at 300,000.
   Dresden's march was authorized by authorities and led by Mayor
Wolfgang Berghofer and the reform-minded local party chief, Hans
Modrow. ADN said it was the first officially approved demonstration
in the city.
   Earlier Monday, the government published a new draft law that is
expected to take effect before Christmas and will permit travel
abroad for up to 30 days a year.
   Flight through Czechoslovakia continued and people who stayed
behind said they were unimpressed by reforms introduced by Egon
Krenz, the president and Communist Party chief who last month
replaced his hard-line mentor, Erich Honecker.
   Church sources said some marchers in Leipzig shouted, ``Egon,
who elected you?''
   This year about 175,000 East Germans _ more than 1 percent of
the population _ have moved to West Germany by emigrating legally,
escaping or failing to return from approved trips abroad. West
Germany gives them automatic citizenship and help in starting over.
   Although the new law would allow travel abroad, East Germans
pointed out it retains old provisions giving authorities the right
to refuse passports for vague reasons.
   It also does not address the problem of financing such travel.
The East German mark is not convertible and lack of foreign
currency could make a legal trip impossible.
   ``Who is going to pay for all this? Who has that much money?''
said a cook in a restaurant on the Unter den Linden boulevard of
East Berlin.
   East Germans poured into Czechoslovakia after their government
lifted a month-old ban on travel to the neighboring Warsaw Pact
ally, still the only nation East Germans can visit without official
permission.
   By the time the ban was removed, 5,000 East Germans had gathered
at the West German Embassy in Prague. Special trains took the East
Germans from the embassy to the West German border and thousands of
others drove through Czechoslovakia in personal cars.
   A line of cars 400 yards long waited at the Schirnding crossing
into northeastern Bavaria. To leave Czechoslovakia, refugees were
required only to show their East German identity cards.
   The unexpected decision to let the refugees out through
Czechoslovakia created the first direct route to the West since the
Berlin Wall was built in August 1961. Authorities have said the
route will remain open until the travel law takes effect.
   Many East Germans, including opposition leaders, reacted coolly
to the draft law.
   Sebastian Pflugbeil, a founder of New Forum, said, ``Travel is
not the primary problem in East Germany. Too many have left the
country already.''
   He said on the West Berlin radio station RIAS: ``The leadership
must make other steps to prove it is earnest in its reform efforts
and to win the trust of the people. The tension between the people
and the party has never been so great as today.''
   Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel said Sunday the law would be
discussed publicly until Nov. 30, then go to Parliament.
   Freedom of travel has been a major demand at pro-democracy
rallies. Krenz, who became Communist Party leader Oct. 18, has
promised sweeping political and economic reforms in addition to
freer travel.
   Passport applications would be handled in 30 days under the new
law, with urgent cases settled in three days or less.
   ``Fleeing the republic'' no longer would be criminal. Dickel
indicated only those caught trying to cross the Berlin Wall or
fortified borders with West Germany would be punished.
   No mention is made in the law of how much hard currency an East
German could take abroad. The limit is 15 marks ($8 at the official
rate) and officials have said shortages could be an obstacle.

   Legislation awaiting final congressional
approval will complete a near doubling in the number of federal
prosecutors since last year to help fight such major crimes as drug
trafficking and fraud.
   Appropriation legislation for the 1990 fiscal year will add 918
new federal prosecutors to the Justice Department payroll.
   Barring unexpected developments, the appropriation bills are
expected to be approved by Congress and sent to President Bush for
his signature. Both bill have cleared conference committee and are
awaiting final approval.
   Last year, Congress appropriated money to hire 440 new federal
prosecutors as part of sweeping anti-drug legislation.
   The two-year expansion increases the number of federal
prosecutors from 1,400 to 2,758.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel cautioned that the
increase may be pared by the automatic sequestration cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   That could result in a 7 percent cut in the number of new
assistant U.S. attorney positions actually financed by Congress,
said a Justice Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Of the new positions, 118 will be assigned to help reduce the
backlog of savings and loan fraud cases piling up in the wake of
the scandals in the nation's thrift institutions.
   The extra positions were requested earlier this year by Bush as
part of the S&amp;L bailout legislation. Congress also appropriated $25
million to hire an additional 100 FBI agents to investigate the
cases.
   Runkel said the Justice Department is considering a proposal to
open up more S&amp;L task forces modeled after the one in Dallas that
has obtained 55 criminal indictments and netted 40 convictions.
   No final decisions have been made, but additional prosecutors
will be assigned to states where there are a large number of fraud
cases. Runkel identified the states as Arizona, California,
Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Minnesota.

   Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. won
a two-week delay Monday on having to testify before the House
Banking Committee about the collapse of his Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   At Keating's request, the panel agreed to delay until Nov. 21
his appearance to answer questions about why regulators allowed
Lincoln to keep operating _ losing billions of dollars in federally
insured deposits in the process _ for two years after federal
examiners recommended closing it.
   Keating originally was scheduled to testify Tuesday before the
panel, along with Edwin Gray, who until June 1987 was chairman of
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in charge of regulating thrifts.
   Gray, who is still scheduled to testify Tuesday, has said in the
past that top regulators were reluctant to move against Lincoln
because of Keating's political influence with several key senators
and House members.
   Although the Banking Committee authorized a subpoena of Keating
on Oct. 12, it was not formally served until Monday, said Leonard
Bickwit, an attorney representing one of Keating's companies.
   ``There was never any attempt to avoid service,'' Bickwit said,
``and Mr. Keating was available for service for a number of days
after the subpoenaes were authorized.''
   Bickwit, however, said Keating had only recently hired an
attorney to represent him personally and that the new attorney
wanted two more weeks to become more familiar with the issues.
   Bank board officials in California formally recommended on May
1, 1987, that the government seize Lincoln because of its mounting
losses. Some of those same officials had been summoned to
Washington twice in the previous month to meet with five senators
whom Keating and his associates had given a total of more than $1.3
million in campaign contributions.
   Lincoln, a 29-branch S&amp;L subsidiary of American Continental
Corp. that is chaired by Keating, was seized by the bank board last
April, nearly two years after federal examiners first recommended
taking it over.
   Officials expect Lincoln's collapse eventually will cost
taxpayers up to $2 billion. That would make it the single most
expensive failure of more than 300 S&amp;Ls taken over by the
government in the past two years.
   In three previous hearings, the Banking Committee has attempted
to focus blame for the magnitude of Lincoln's losses on M. Danny
Wall, formerly the bank board's chairman and now director of is
successor agency, the Office of Thrift Supervison in the Treasury
Department.

   Former President Jimmy Carter challenged
President Bush on Monday to respond decisively to the rise of
democratic movements in Eastern Europe. ``We have got to get our
act together,'' Carter said.
   Carter told an audience here that there is ``substantial proof''
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is producing irreversible change
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and said the response of the
Bush administration ``doesn't match what Gorbachev is doing.''
   In a strongly worded criticism of a kind he has rarely made
since leaving office in 1981, Carter said that only the United
States can provide a response worthy of the changes Gorbachev has
wrought.
   ``The spokesman for the Western world has got to be the
president of the United States,'' Carter said. ``I think we need to
be able to respond to Gorbachev because he is winning a tremendous
propaganda victory in all of the many countries I have visited. ...
We have got to get our act together.''
   Carter, who is in Washington for a reunion of the people who
staffed his presidential campaigns and administration, was joined
at a seminar by former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who said
the slowness of the Bush administration to respond to events is
being felt among those in Eastern Europe struggling for democracy.
   ``Now is the time to strike,'' Mondale said. ``I think the
circumstances are such that we need a much more rapid U.S. policy
responsse.
   ``The people of Poland speak to us of the joy of democracy and
freedom. We come back with the language of bookkeeppers and
bureaucrats.''
   Carter and Mondale commented as they took part in a seminar
dedicated to the ways and means of ``waging peace.''
   The former president also challenged Bush to more closely engage
the United States in the pursuit of peace in the Middle East,
saying the president must make it clear he intends to pursue a
peace agreement with all of its will and vigor and will not
withdraw until it is achieved.
   Using the resources of the Carter Presidential Center in
Atlanta, Carter has been engaged in monitoring the electoral
process in Nicaragua. He said his purpose is ``to make it extremely
difficult _ impossible _ for either party to withdraw from the
election when one side or the other discoveres it is likely to
lose.''
   Carter also he said he believes recent attacks by Contra rebels
across the Honduran border into Nicaragua have been aimed at
disrupting the process of registering voters.
   Carter said he believes Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's Marxist
president, ``made a tragic and deplorable mistake'' last week when
he announced he was cancelling an 18-month cease-fire with the
rebels.
   But he said he does not believe Ortega's action ``is going to
interfere with the holding of an election.''
   Although he criticized Bush's policies, Carter had earlier
voiced nothing but praise for the cooperation given the Carter
Center since the Bush administration took office.
   The former president, speaking at Georgetown University, said
the center's activities had little support from the White House
while Ronald Reagan was president.
   ``Since George Bush has been in office, we have had an almost
perfect relationship,'' he said.
   At that event, attended by friends and political associates as
well as Georgetown students, Carter appeared loose, relaxed and by
turns serious and funny as he described his work at the Carter
Center to promote global health, housing, human rights and peace.
   Carter said that under his direction the Carter Center has
dedicated itself to ``filling vacuums'' untouched by other
international efforts.
   His wife, Rosalynn, said that the center in Atlanta now has a
budget of $17 million a year and that an endowment of $50 million
is sought for a permanent fund to pay for maintenance, upkeep and
repairs.
   On Sunday, some 2,000 people who worked in Carter's presidential
campaigns, staffed the White House and worked for his
administration gathered in a hotel ballroom to cheer him once again.
   On Monday, at Georgetown, Carter and his wife gave a smaller
audience a reunion report on what they have been doing lately.
   They have been doing a lot at the Carter Center, they said, from
fighting a vicious African parasite called the Guinea Worm to
organizing a drive to inoculate the world's children against polio
to finding textbooks for the war-ravaged schools of Uganda to
organizing peace talks in Ethiopia's 28-year civil war.
   Mrs. Carter said she and her husband discovered after they left
the White House in defeat that they had not walked away empty
handed.
   ``What we've learned is that we still have resources,'' she
said. ``Because Jimmy was president, we can call on anybody in the
world and ask for their influence _ and they help.''

<HEAD>Bush Meets With Vessey on POW-MIA Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush received a report Monday from
retired Gen. John W. Vessey Jr. on talks in Vietnam about American
servicemen unaccounted for in Indochina.
   ``Our policy remains that we will continue to follow every lead
on the assumption that Americans are alive,'' White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``We have no evidence that there are alive Americans but we will
continue to pursue every bit of information until it's proven there
are none,'' he said.
   Vessey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is Bush's
special presidential emissary for POW-MIA affairs. He met in
Vietnam on Oct. 29 and 30 with Vice Premier Nguyen Co Thach and
later said they had agreed to increase cooperation to clear up
discrepancies and increase research in POW-MIA matters.
   ``The president said he was very pleased to hear of the
agreements to expand efforts to resolve the POW-MIA issue, and
looks forward to continued progress on this and other humanitarian
concerns,'' Fitzwater said.
   The United States says there are 2,331 Americans still missing
or unaccounted for in Indochina.

<HEAD>New Monthly Record of 8,300 Soviet Jews Emigrate Through Vienna</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 8,300 Soviet Jewish emigres were
registered at the Vienna transit center in October, the fifth
straight monthly record, officials said Monday.
   Regina Boucault of the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration
said 45,970 Jews had left the Soviet Union via Austria this year.
She said only 115 of the 8,360 registering in October chose to live
in Israel.
   October's total, up from 7,469 in September, was the largest
since the agency began keeping monthly figures in 1979, Ms.
Boucault said. The 10-month total for 1989 is more than the 20,082
in all of 1988.
   So far this year, 1,065 emigres have gone to Israel. Most seek
resettlement in the United States.
   About 350,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement
program began in 1971. The largest annual number, 51,328, was in
1979.

   The Security Council debated on Monday
whether to send a fact-finding mission to observe Israel's
crackdown on the Palestinian uprising.
   A resolution before the council also demands that Israel return
confiscated property or compensate Beit Sahour, a Palestinian
village of about 10,000 in the occupied West Bank that refused to
pay taxes to Israeli authorities.
   The town, just southeast of Bethlehem, is predominantly
Christian.
   Israel began tax raids on Beit Sahour on Sept. 20. Troops
confiscated at least $1.5 million worth of machinery, cars,
refrigerators, household goods and personal effects to be sold at
auction.
   Kuwaiti Ambassador Mohammed Abdulhasan said in introducing the
resolution, ``The people in Beit Sahour ... raise the same banner
... raised by the young revolutionaries in Boston during the fight
for independence _ `No taxation without representation.'''
   A vote was expected later this week.
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein dwelt on Palestinian violence in
his address, describing in detail the ax murders or stabbings of
five Palestinians in October. The victims were mutilated, some in
front of family members or while praying in a mosque.
   ``These are only five gruesome examples of the violent murders
perpetrated by PLO hit squads, five out of 23 similar murders
committed in October, in one month only, for failing to toe the
line,'' said Bein.
   ``Indeed, the rate of PLO attacks against Palestinians increased
sharply following the promulgation of Israel's peace initiative in
April 1989,'' he said, reporting that it increased seven-fold.
   Stung by international criticism, Israel last week lifted its
roadblocks around Beit Sahour.
   ``Taxation without liberation is tyranny,'' declared Zudhi Labib
Terzi, the Palestine Liberation Organization's permanent observer.
   Terzi asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
dispatch U.N. observers to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
home to about 1.7 million Palestinians.
   Israeli gunfire has killed about 611 Palestinians during the
22-month-old uprising. Forty Israelis have died in the violence. At
least 141 Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel.

<HEAD>Reports of Fraud Prompt Cut-Off of Route Used By Tens Of Thousands</HEAD>

   Reports of fraudulent Soviet exit permits have
prompted the State Department to restrict access to a European
route used by tens of thousands of Soviet Jews to come to the
United States, officials said Monday.
   A pattern of fraud emerged last month, apparently involving some
individuals in the Soviet agency that issues the permits, officials
said, adding that the going rate was 5,000 rubles _ or about $3,200
_ apiece.
   Officials didn't say how many exit permits were illegal, but
that a pattern had been established that would increase unless the
United States acted.
   Permits had to be dated before Oct. 1 for Soviet Jews to obtain
U.S. visas in Rome or Vienna, and the applicants had to also have
Israeli visas. Otherwise, prospective emigrants are processed
through the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   Soviet Jews who reach Vienna or Rome are considered to be ``in
the pipeline'' and are virtually certain to be accepted unless
there are security or other problems. Those who apply at the U.S.
Embassy, however, are up against U.S. quotas.
   The new restriction, announced by spokesman Richard Boucher,
required emigrants to obtain their Israeli visas by Monday. A
notice of the change was posted Wednesday at the U.S. Embassy and
at the Dutch Embassy, where Israeli visas are obtained.
   As a result of the change, Soviet Jews may remain at home rather
than waiting in Rome or Vienna until their entry to the United
States is approved. However, getting to America could be more
difficult.
   Jews who leave the Soviet Union after Monday on Israeli visas
will be presumed to have chosen to emigrate to Israel, U.S.
officials said.
   Israeli visas long have been the best device for Jews to leave
the Soviet Union whether they intended to go the Israel, the United
States or elsewhere. However, under President Mikhail Gorbachev's
reforms, applying directly for admission to the United States may
offer an equal opportunity to leave.

<HEAD>Dutch Authors Say Swedish Bank Cooperated with the Nazis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLINA EHRNROOTH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Wallenberg brothers who headed
Sweden's largest commercial bank during World War II helped Nazi
Germany dispose of gold and jewels stripped from murdered Jews,
according to a book published Monday.
   Dutch authors Gerard Aalders and Cees Wiebes, in their book
``The Art of Cloaking,'' said the Wallenberg brothers also acted as
front men to disguise foreign subsidiaries of German companies
associated with Adolf Hitler's regime.
   Editorials in Swedish newspapers marking the 40th anniversary of
the war's outbreak have renewed the debate over the role neutral
Sweden played in the war.
   Marcus and Jacob Wallenberg, as heads of Stockholm's Enskilda
Bank, were one of Sweden's richest and most influential dynasties.
The bank, founded by the family in 1856, played a central role in
Sweden's industrialization and development before and after World
War II.
   Aalders and Wiebes claim the Enskilda was among Swedish and
Swiss banks that bought gold, stocks, jewelry and art collections
stolen from Jews and other victims imprisoned and killed in Nazi
concentration camps.
   Their book says Marcus Wallenberg told a British diplomat in
1946 that his bank bought confiscated property from the Nazis, and
the diplomat reported that information in a confidential cable to
Washington. Some of the stolen items were found after the war in
Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Latin America and other countries.
   The authors said they traced accounts that the Wallenbergs
helped establish covers for subsidiaries of Bosch, IG Farben, Krupp
and other German corporations to avoid having their assets
confiscated by Allied governments.
   They wrote that under a secret agreement the German corporations
would have the right to repurchase the companies once the war was
over.
   The authors said one such company was the American Bosch Corp.,
which they said conducted research for the U.S. Defense Deparatment
and sent information back to Berlin.
   ``Swedish neutrality made all this possible,'' Aalders wrote.
   Peder Bonde, a nephew of the brothers, told Swedish radio the
family had no reason to be ashamed of the Wallenbergs' wartime
business dealings.
   ``They did business with businessmen who wanted to protect their
own property. They were not Nazis,'' said Bonde.
   He said he found it hard to believe that their transactions
could have taken place without the government's knowledge.
   Aalders said the practices used to help German firms during
World War II are being employed today to circumvent embargos
against South Africa.
   The authors speculated that the links the Wallenberg brothers
had with the Nazis might help explain why their relative, Swedish
diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, was seized by Soviet forces when they
captured Budapest, Hungary, in 1945.
   Raoul Wallenberg, whose father was the bankers' cousin, was
credited with providing documents that saved tens of thousands of
Hungarian Jews from being sent to Nazi death camps. He was taken to
the Soviet Union and the Soviets have said he died in prison in
1947. Former prison inmates have said they saw Raoul Wallenberg
after 1947.
   Per Anger, who served with Raoul Wallenberg at the Budapest
legation, called the authors' theory ``fantastic speculation.''
   ``Raoul didn't belong to the inner circle of the bank,'' Anger
said in a newspaper interview.

<HEAD>Senator Says Pentagon Planninh to Boost Off-Shelf Purchases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is planning to buy more
off-the-shelf commercial products at a potential savings in the
save hundreds of millions of dollars, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
said Monday.
   The plan offers the hope the Defense Department will wean itself
from excessive use of custom-made merchandise, Levin said as he
released a Senate subcommittee report on the subject.
   ``We expect there will be a significant reduction in taxpayer
money that is spent on these products that should be bought
commercially (but are) being designed from scratch,'' Levin told a
news conference.
   The Pengaton has a shopping list of about 50,000 items it
regularly purchases, only 3 percent of which are commercially
available, he said.
   ``That is a terrible track record,'' Levin said, vowing to push
the armed services to double or triple the percentage annually
until roughly half of its purchases are off-the-shelf.
   Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said he had not seen the report
and could not comment on it. The 31-point plan is still being put
together, he said.
   ``We've been looking at this area for a long time now,'' Flood
said. ``It's a slow process. It can't be done overnight.''
   The Pentagon has increased the number of specialists looking for
ways to boost use of commercial products from two to six in the
wake of hearings by the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government
Management, Levin said.
   Levin, chairman of the panel, said the hearings produced
embarrassing evidence of over-reliance on products developed
specifically for military use _ including foods such as
chocolate-chip cookies and applesauce.
   Additionally, he said, the hearings showed that military
specifications for products it buys are so complex that many
contractors are discouraged from submitting bids. That reduces
competition and inflates costs, he said.
   Pentagon tests ``are much too rigid. They are arcane, ancient,''
he said, pounding his fist on a foot-high stack of papers on his
desk. The stack of documents were those through which a contractor
must wade to submit a bid for selling the Pentagon an oscilloscope
_ a device that measures variations in electrical currents.
   The 1990 defense spending bill approved by a House-Senate
conference committee last week directs the Pentagon to increase
off-the-shelf purchases.

<HEAD>Senate Opens Debate on Minimum Wage Compromise but Schedule Unclear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate opened debate Monday on the
compromise plan to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25, with a
leading Republican conceding the measure would pass easily but
warning it would cost jobs and fuel inflation.
   ``Every good and material that is sold in America is going to go
up in cost,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``I think that means
we're going to have some very difficult economic times in the
future. I hope I'm wrong.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., criticized Hatch's arguments
and called the planned increase from $3.35 to $4.25 by April 1991
``a very small adjustment'' that will leave minimum-wage earners
well behind inflation since the last increase in 1981.
   ``We have really, I think, failed in our compact with those
Americans who are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder,''
Kennedy said.
   ``Never in the half century of the minimum wage has this long a
period elapsed without an increase and may we do everything in our
power to make sure that the working poor never have to wait that
long again.''
   The House-passed proposal, which also would create a subminimum
``training wage'' for teen-agers, is the product of a deal struck a
week ago between President Bush and Congress' majority Democrats.
   Kennedy and Hatch were the only senators to speak on the issue
Monday, and whether a final vote will come Tuesday appeared to
hinge on whether Republicans and Democrats reached agreement on a
plan to raise the government's debt ceiling.
   Several Republicans are mulling amendments that could delay a
final vote on the minimum-wage bill indefinitely but an agreement
on the debt limit likely would lead to an agreement on a timetable
for debate on the wage bill as well.
   House and Senate leaders were meeting Monday night to discuss
the debt limit.
   The minimum-wage bill provides two 45-cent increases, one April
1 and the other a year later. It also allows employers to pay a
lower wage to workers ages 16 to 19 with fewer than three months
total job experience.
   The subminimum could be paid for three additional months if the
workers were in certified training programs. The subminimum would
be $3.35 beginning April 1 and rise to $3.61 April 1, 1991.
   The provision allowing the lower wage expires in 1993.

   Gov. George Deukmejian crossed San
Francisco Bay by ferry Monday, joining scores of commuters forced
from their cars by the earthquake, then signed a 12-bill relief
package officials hope will raise $800 million.
   ``I give the people of this area my pledge: I will make sure we
will do what we have to do,'' Deukmejian said as he signed
emergency legislation to help restore businesses, highways and
homes damaged in the Oct. 17 quake. The 7.1-magnitude earthquake
ravaged Northern California, killing 66 people and injuring more
than 3,000.
   ``We're going to do whatever's necessary to restore the lives
and the homes of the people who were victims of this earthquake,''
said Deukmejian. He said the legislative package, which includes a
temporary sales tax hike, was absolutely necesssary.
   The bill-signing ceremony took place at the Ferry Building, at
the foot of the damaged San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and across
the street from a section of the Embarcadero Freeway that has been
closed and reinforced with beams.
   State lawmakers approved the package over the weekend during a
three-day special session, although the deal was nearly derailed by
partisan squabbling.
   The governor said he sailed on the Catalina Empress from
Oakland's Jack London Square to the World Trade Club in San
Francisco to publicize a mass-transit system that commuters unable
to cross the damaged Bay Bridge have increasingly relied on.
   The quake collapsed sections of Interstate 880 near Oakland and
the Bay Bridge, forcing thousands of commuters who normally drive
to use ferries, Bay Area Rapid Transit trains, and other bridges
and freeways to get to work.
   State authorities have estimated total damage at more than $7
billion, including about $1.7 billion to state and county roads.
   The 13-month, quarter-cent sales tax increase will raise an
estimated $800 million, with another $200 million coming from state
reserves. Also included in the package was $150 million in tax
relief.
   Several Northern California legislators complained the
legislation isn't enough, and insisted quake repairs will cost
substantially more than the $4.25 billion in approved federal aid
and state funds.
   ``It's going to be closer to $10 billion, believe me,'' said
Sen. Nick Petris, an Alameda County Democrat who pushed for a
half-cent sales tax increase. ``This is no time to be pandering to
the pockets of the people.''
   The tax hike, opposed by most Republicans in the Assembly,
passed the lower house Saturday with only two votes to spare. It
passed the Senate on a 34-2 vote.
   Lawmakers recessed their special earthquake session Saturday
evening, postponing action until January on other
earthquake-related measures.
   California's statewide sales tax is currently 6 percent,
although the tax is as high as 7 percent in parts of the state
where local voters have approved higher levies. The extra
quarter-cent tax will be in effect from Dec. 1 of this year through
Dec. 31, 1990.

   The Soviet coal minister met Monday with striking
miners in the Arctic but failed to persuade them to end their
walkout, which officials say threatens winter fuel supplies.
   Mikhail I. Shchadov met for three hours with strikers from 11
mines in the Pechora Basin, but did not adequately assure them
their working, social and living conditions would improve, said
Alexander Petrovsky, who attended the session.
   Miners were promised improved living and working conditions in
July after a nationwide strike.
   Workers in the largest mine of the Pechora Basin went on strike
Oct. 25 to protest government delays in fulfilling the promises.
   They were joined last week by miners at 10 other shafts, and
only two mines in the region continued working, with more than
15,000 miners on strike. The official news agency Tass reported
Monday that four mines were operating.
   Shchadov told miners part of the July decree pledging
improvements was being implemented on schedule and that the rest
was awaiting action by the Soviet legislature, according to
Petrovsky, who spoke by telephone and described himself as a worker
from Vorkuta.
   Petrovsky and strike committee member Nikolai A. Teryokhin, who
was interviewed in Moscow, said miners were not satisfied with
Shchadov's report and would continue the walkout.
   On Sunday, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said the situation in the
coal industry ``creates an inadmissible situation in ensuring vital
supplies for our people, for the work of basic and other sectors of
the national economy.''
   Ryzhkov, in remarks distributed by Tass, asked the strikers to
show ``reason and a sense of civic duty.''
   But the miners remain unsatisfied.
   ``We share the concern of the chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council
of Ministers N.I. Ryzhkov over the current situation in the coal
industry,'' strike committee leader V. Kopasov told Tass. ``But the
miners don't believe that their demands will be met. They need
clear guarantees.''
   Kopasov said Shchadov did not have the authority to make such
guarantees and that the miners want to speak only to a government
commission.
   The Vorkuta miners, meanwhile, appealed to the AFL-CIO trade
union group in the United States to send a delegation to meet with
them and offer ``material and technical support,'' according to a
statement released by Teryokhin. A similar appeal was made to
British miners.
   The strike violates a law passed by the Soviet legislature last
month banning walkouts in such vital sectors as energy and defense.
A local court has ruled the strike illegal but has not moved to
halt it.
   Government officials are scheduled to meet with miners Nov. 17
to review how well the government has kept its promises.

representative to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament.
   The post carries the rank of ambassador. The conference oversees
various East-West negotiations.
   Ledogar, 60, since 1987 has been in the top U.S. official in
negotiations under way in Vienna between NATO and Warsaw on
reducing conventional forces.
   He is being succeeded in that post by James Woolsey, a former
Pentagon official in the Carter administration and a conservative

   In other announcements, Bush said he will nominate Barry Lambert
Harris, president of the Alliance Corp. of Portland, Maine, as
deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Adminstation.
   Harris, 50, is former assistant city manager of Gloucester,
Mass., and was a documentary writer-producer for WBZ-TV in Boston.
   If confirmed by the Senate, he would replace Barbara McConnell
Barrett.
   Bush also announced his selection of businessman William Houk of
Shelby, Ohio, to be public printer. Houk, 62, would succeed Ralph

   An Ohio congressman on Monday made public part
of what he said was an insurance investigator's report alleging
West German intelligence tipped the CIA to a possible bomb aboard
Pan Am Flight 103.
   The plane blew up last December over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing 259 people. U.S. officials have denied having any such
advance information.
   Rep. James Traficant was accompanied at a news conference by
former CIA officer Victor Marchetti, from whom he said he got the
report. Marchetti left the agency in 1969 and later wrote a
critical book, ``The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence.''
   The excerpts released by Traficant describe a West German
intelligence agent watching baggage handlers an hour before the
flight left Frankfurt, singling out one suspicious suitcase and
deciding ``something was very wrong.''
   West German intelligence passed on the concern to a CIA unit in
Frankfurt, which relayed it to an unidentified ``control,'' says
the excerpt from the insurance investigator's report. ``Control
replied: `Don't worry about it, don't stop it, let it go,''' the
excerpt says.
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield, who last week called the report
``nonsense,'' said Monday ``It's still nonsense.''
   Pan Am, which has been sued for more than $300 million, said in
court documents filed last week that it is trying to show the
United States got warnings from West German and Israeli
intelligence.
   Administration officials on Monday denied that they were tipped
off by any foreign intelligence agency about the bombing of the Pan
Am flight.
   Rosemary Wolfe of Alexandria, Va., whose stepdaughter Miriam was
among the victims on Flight 103, said she didn't know whether to
believe the allegations but ``I think we're getting closer to the
answers.''
   At his news conference, Traficant handed out five of 27 pages of
a report which he said shows connections between the bombing and a
trans-Atlantic heroin shipment, hostage rescue efforts, terrorists
and spies.
   The other 22 pages were withheld pending a meeting with Pan Am's
lawyers, Traficant said.
   The Ohio Democrat first made his allegations Friday, saying then
that the report concluded the CIA was ``covering up a drug run,''
protecting the terrorists' Frankfurt-to-New York heroin route in
exchange for contacts that might lead to the release of American
hostages.

   The Catholic Church is mounting an offensive
against legalized abortion in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling
allowing states more freedom in setting limits on the practice.
   ``Don't forget the baby. That's all the Catholic Church is
saying to America,'' Archbishop John May, president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said Monday in a speech opening the
conference's fall meeting.
   Leaders of the 53 million-member church are scheduled to vote
Tuesday on a policy statement on abortion calling on Catholics to
``give urgent attention and priority to this issue'' to counteract
efforts by abortion rights advocates galvanized by the court ruling
in the Missouri case.
   Abortion rights advocates said the bishops' new activism was
expected in light of the court ruling and the recent
``backstepping'' by some politicians challenged by pro-choice
groups.
   ``I think this meeting marks their re-emergence as a political
force on this issue,'' said Frances Kissling, president of
Catholics for a Free Choice. ``They're ready to go.''
   At the opening session of the four-day meeting, representatives
of the U.S. church and the Vatican celebrated the bicentennial of
the U.S. hierarchy by noting how the church was shaped by the
American principles of religious liberty and democracy. The Rev.
John Carroll was appointed the first U.S. bishop on Nov. 6, 1789
   Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, who is Vatican secretary of state
and papal legate to the bicentennial, warned the bishops not to be
discouraged from entering into public policy debates.
   ``The religious freedom so forcibly affirmed by your founding
fathers was not intended to exclude religion from society, from
public life and public morality. That would truly be freedom in
reverse,'' Casaroli said.
   In his speech, May said Americans need to hear the church's
voice on issues ranging from the Middle East to poverty, but
abortion is the issue ``where clear-cut moral principle stands tall
above all else.''
   In a letter to the bishops, Pope John Paul II said Catholics
have played a ``significant role in upholding the moral principles
of justice, freedom, and respect for human dignity.''
   The Pope, however, never directly addressed the abortion issue,
but instead asked the bishops to uphold ``the dignity and rights of
the human person from conception to natural death.''
   Comparing abortion to dropping a child in the Baltimore Harbor,
May said there is no difference between a child a few months after
birth and a child in the womb.
   ``The church, therefore, has no option: It must speak out to
protect that child,'' said May, adding that the Catholic Church
promises to care for any pregnant woman.
   Kissling said May's remarks a ``are really simply cruel and
unusual punishment to the Catholic and non-Catholic women who
decide to have abortions.''
   The resolution on abortion from the bishops' Committee for
Pro-Life Activities said the Supreme Court decision in Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services was encouraging. The decision upheld
Missouri's law banning abortions in public hospitals and stopped
public employees from counseling women about abortions. The law
also required doctors performing abortions to first test any fetus
over 20 weeks old to determine if it could live outside the womb.
   But the Supreme Court's ruling also has caused abortion rights
advocates to threaten ``retaliation against politicians who do not
support permisive abortion.''
   In calling upon Catholics to redouble their efforts, the
committee said, ``At this particular time, abortion has become the
fundamental human rights issue for all men and women of good will.''
   In other business Monday, the bishops decided to develop a
pastoral letter on stewardship in order to find ways to reach
deeper into the pockets of Catholics in the pews to meet the
church's financial needs.
   Bishop Warren L. Boudreaux of the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux in
Lousiana said red is fine liturgical color, but is not good news at
the end of a financial statement.
   ``We are called to bring the good news. Let's do it,'' he told
the bishops.
   The conference president was asked to appoint a committee to
develop the pastoral letter by the June 1991 meeting of the
bishops' conference.
   In addition to the abortion issue, the bishops on Tuesday are
scheduled to elect a new conference president and vote on a
proposal _ prompted by the severe clergy shortage _ from the
bishops Committee on the Liturgy on an ``Order for Sunday
celebrations in the Absence of a Priest.''
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, conference vice
president, is expected to be elevated to the presidency, while nine
other archbishops vie for the vice presidency.

<HEAD>Contras Will Meet Sandinistas at UN This Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with amnestied Contras speaking in Managua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of Nicaraguan rebels have agreed
to meet Sandinista government representatives this week for the
first direct peace talks in more than a year, U.N. officials said
Monday.
   When President Daniel Ortega canceled a 19-month-old truce last
week, he also proposed a meeting at U.N. headquarters. Nadia
Younes, a U.N. spokeswoman, said the two sides had agreed to meet
Thursday and Friday.
   Nicaragua's U.N. mission said Victor Hugo Tinoco, deputy foreign
minister, probably would lead the government delegation.
   A senior U.N. official said privately all issues will be on the
table, including the voluntary disbanding of the rebels, known as
Contras; security guarantees for those repatriated from rebel bases
in neighboring Honduras and political reform in Nicaragua.
   In Honduras, Contra military leader Enrique Bermudez told The
Associated Press, ``We have accepted the new proposal for dialogue
from Ortega,'' and said he would lead a five-man rebel delegation.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Roman Catholic primate of
Nicaragua, has agreed to attend as an observer. He has been a
go-between for the Sandinistas and Contras in the past.
   Also present will be the International Commission for
Verification and Support consisting of one official each from the
United Nations and Organization of American States. The commission
was established under the Central American peace plan of Aug. 7 to
help the Contras disarm and resettle in Nicaragua with their
families.
   The Contras are expected to insist on resuming the cease-fire.
They also want a general amnesty and guarantees that they can visit
Nicaragua to verify that reforms have been made and it is safe for
them to return.
   The peace plan says the Contras must be disbanded by Dec. 5, but
also that their repatriation be voluntary.
   So far, the rebels have shown no inclination to lay down their
weapons and return home, although some have gone back to Nicaragua
with their weapons.
   Ortega said the infiltrating Contras had killed dozens of people
and were trying to disrupt the campaign for national elections to
be held Feb. 25.
   According to the State Department, about 2,000 Contras have
returned to Nicaragua from Honduras, making a total of 4,000 in
Nicaragua and about 10,000 remaining in Honduras.
   Carlos Lopez Contreras, the Honduran foreign minister, said
Friday the rebels are ``a Nicaraguan problem'' and his government
will not participate in the meetings at U.N. headquarters.
   The last direct talks between the Contras and Sandinistas, in
June 1988, failed when the government rejected Contra demands for
reform that included an end to Sandinista control of the army and
police.
   In Managua on Monday, the Defense Ministry presented two men
identified as Contra commanders and 13 other rebels to journalists
and said they had accepted amnesty.
   Orlando Barrera and Carlos Martinez, the commanders, said they
were ordered to tell people to vote for the United Nicaraguan
Opposition, the main opposition to the Sandinistas, in the February
elections.
   ``We told people that if they didn't vote for UNO they would
have problems, and that meant we were going to kidnap them
afterward,'' Barrera said. The opposition party denies links to the
Contras.
   Santos Guzman, a 15-year-old rebel, said: ``We put down our
weapons because we had no ammunition, no food. We just walked, and
when we encountered the army, we ran.''

<HEAD>Former President Juan Bosch Ahead in Polls for 1990 Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll published Monday
indicated former President Juan Bosch, whose leftist policies led
to a coup and a U.S. invasion in 1965, is favored to win the 1990
presidential election.
   President Joaquin Balaguer, 83 and nearly blind from glaucoma,
has not said he will run again. Bosch, now 80, has led in polls for
a year.
   A Gallup survey published Monday in the daily El Siglo said
Bosch was the favorite of 29 percent of 1,279 people questioned.
Balaguer had 27 percent support; Jacobo Majluta, a former
president, got 14; and Mayor Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of Santo
Domingo had 11. No margin of error was given.
   The May 16 presidential election will be the eighth since
military dictator Rafael L. Trujillo was assassinated in 1961.
   Bosch, a historian, poet and novelist, won the presidency in
1963 in the first free election after Trujillo.
   He was ousted from office after seven months by a military coup.
Bosch supporters tried to put him back in power, factional fighting
broke out and President Lyndon B. Johnson sent 23,000 Marines in
1965.
   As leader of the Dominican Liberation Party, Bosch campaigns as
a moderate. He denies being a Communist, but he told The Associated
Press in December he follows Marxist economic doctrine.
   Balaguer has been elected president five times, most recently in
1986, but pursuing an expensive public works program at a time of
economic crisis has cost him support.

   Rain showers stretched along the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf
Coast on Monday as snow fell on parts of Colorado.
   The showers reached from New England to Virginia, Tennessee, the
Carolinas and northern Georgia. Showers and thunderstorms extended
from Alabama to Mississippi, southeast Arkansas, Louisiana and the
upper two-thirds of the Texas coast. Thunderstorms produced hail at
Port O'Connor, Texas.
   Scattered rain showers also fell over northwest Minnesota, upper
Michigan, southeast Iowa and the Idaho Panhandle. Rain reached from
the Oregon coast to western Washington state.
   Snow showers in the mountains of northern Colorado tapered off
but continued in the central part of the state. At least 2 inches
of snow fell in Leadville, 3 inches in Winter Park and 8 inches on
the Eisenhower Tunnel.
   Snow was forecast for the Cascades of Oregon, where up to 5
inches fell in the passes Monday morning.
   A high wind watch was posted through Tuesday along the northwest
mountains of Wyoming and the southeast mountains of Wyoming.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 1.4 inches at the Air Force base near Columbus, Miss.,
1.22 inches at Birmingham, Ala., and 1.01 inches at Tupelo, Miss.
   High temperature records for the date were set in Pensacola,
Fla., where it was 81 degrees, 1 degree higher than the mark set in

Shreveport, La. (86 degrees, 85 in 1980).
   The low temperature in the Lower 48 states was 12 degrees at
Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 25
degrees in Yellowstone to 90 degrees in Fort Myers, Fla.

<HEAD>Students March After Racial Slurs Hit College</HEAD>

   Students at MacMurray College marched
across campus Monday to show unity against racism after a campaign
of anonymous threats and racial slurs against blacks hit the small,
private school.
   ``We must come together,'' sophomore Ricky Bragg, told about 350
students, faculty and residents who marched to the college chapel.
   ``There is no way this can be a white problem or a black problem
or a Jewish problem. This is MacMurray's problem,'' said Bragg, who
is black.
   The student-organized march came four days after hand-written
letters containing racial slurs and threats were found in campus
mailboxes of the 35 to 40 black students at the 620-student
liberal-arts school, and in the box of the college's only black
staff member.
   The letters were addressed to students by name and campus
mailbox number, and contained slurs directed at the person,
according to students who saw the letters.
   Investigators were trying to develop leads from fingerprints on
the letters, but hadn't identified any suspects, said Tom Weeks,
police chief in Jacksonville in west-central Illinois, 30 miles
west of Springfield.
   ``Right now, it looks like it's at a dead end,'' he said.
   Since the letters were discovered, the school's administration
has sponsored a series of meetings to talk about racial tensions on
campus.
   ``This is a marvelous educational opportunity for our
students,'' said college President Edward Mitchell. ``They're
dealing with a real-life problem. In that way, it differs from all
the other problems we have in college where you have a right
answer. Here there is no right answer.''
   Junior Michelle Sharp, who is white, told her fellow students
that by attending the rally, ``You're saying that there is a
problem, that something's broken and it needs to be fixed.''
   Before the rally, Cathleen Hopkins, a senior who is black, said
the administration had put too much stress on blacks and whites
talking to each other in the wake of the incident.
   ``It's past the communication stage,'' she said. ```What are you
going to do?' is what we want to know.''
   But Mitchell said way to deal with racial problems will evolve
from the meetings. ``One of the things I tried not to do was to
define the problem and the solution because then it would be my
problem and my solution,'' he said.

   A bomb tossed from a passing car
exploded early Monday outside the circulation office of the local
newspaper El Tiempo, causing minor damage to the building but no
injuries, the daily said.
   In Cartagena, another Caribbean port, a bomb exploded outside a
bank but injured no one, police said.
   The pre-dawn attack was the first against El Tiempo, Colombia's
largest circulation daily, since violence escalated in August in
response to the government's war against drug barons. The cartels
have promised to retaliate for the five suspects extradited to the
United States on drug charges.
   The media in particular have been under constant attack by the
drug traffickers. In the last two months, four journalists have
been killed, several other news people have been wounded and the
building of the El Espectador has been bombed by terrorists hired
by the drug lords.
   At least 39 people have been killed and 226 injured since
President Virgilio Barco on Aug. 19 announced a tough set of
measures to fight drug traffickers, including extradition, perhaps
the penalty feared most by Colombian drug lords.
   Barco's decision to actively pursue traffickers came a day after
the slaying of opposition presidential candidate Sen. Luis Galan at
a political rally. Barco by law cannot run for re-election.

   The $50 billion that Congress appropriated
this summer to rescue the savings and loan industry will be
depleted in the next 14 months, officials in charge of the bailout
said Monday.
   Daniel P. Kearney, president of the federal Resolution Trust
Corp. oversight board, told a House task force on the bailout that
the $50 billion will be exhausted by the end of December 1990.
   Officials had warned earlier the government might have to borrow
another $50 billion to $100 billion of short-term ``working
capital'' beyond the $50 billion approved by Congress in August to
cover the deposit losses of failed thrift institutions as they are
closed or sold to new investors.
   But Kearney's assessment on how fast money is being spent on
some 290 failed thrifts passing through the government's hands
shocked lawmakers who were repeatedly told by the Bush
administration that $50 billion was all that would be needed.
   ``It's mind-boggling to think that we're going to have another
blank check here,'' said Rep. Tom McMillan, D-Md.
   Kearney said the oversight board _ composed of Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp _
should have a plan ready within the next two weeks on how to raise
the additional cash.
   Administration officials maintain that the $50 billion
authorized through the bailout legislation may cover the net loss
to taxpayers once all the loans, properties and other assets of the
seized thrifts are sold. But they acknowledge that could be several
years away.
   Meanwhile, Kearney and other officials said, the administration
wants to shore up the working capital needed to cover despositors'
insured losses through short-term borrowings. As the assets are
sold, the working capital that was borrowed would be repaid.
   But to prevent the short-term borrowings from ballooning annual
federal deficits, the administration has proposed setting up an
off-budget Resolution Funding Bank to issue the new debt.
   Democrats insist that any additional borrowing above the initial
$50 billion come directly through the Treasury, a move that would
swell the fiscal 1991 and 1992 deficits and force either spending
cuts elsewhere or a tax increase.
   Assistant Comptroller General Richard L. Fogel said both
Congress and the administration need ``to engage in a much more
honest dialogue this time about what it's going to take.''
   As a watchdog in Congress' General Accounting Office, Fogel said
the administration ``should come back to Congress, even though it
might not be what you want to here, and say they need more money.''
   That's not likely, said Bert Ely, a private S&amp;L analyst in
Alexandria, Va., who has persistently criticized Congress and the
Reagan and Bush administrations' handling of the thrift crisis.
   Ely said no one in Congress or the administration wants to have
to write another S&amp;L bailout law that includes billions of dollars
in more government spending before the 1992 election.
   The administration is effectively telling Congress: ```Don't
push us too hard on this working capital thing, or we will be back
up here,''' he said.

<HEAD>Candidate Accuses President of Manipulating Election Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential candidate on Monday
accused President Jose Sarney of trying to manipulate next week's
election, the first free presidential balloting since 1960.
   Front-runner Fernando Collor de Mello claimed Sarney has ``a
sinister plan'' to manipulate the Nov. 15 election by backing the
last-minute candidacy of Silvio Santos, head of Brazil's
second-largest television network.
   ``I'm talking to you, Jose Sarney. I'm talking to an
irresponsible, dishonest and weak man,'' Collor de Mello said in
his spot on a 70-minute television campaign program, which all five
networks are required to run twice a day.
   Collor de Mello, leader of the center-right National
Reconstruction Party, called Sarney ``incapable, incompetent and
corrupt.''
   Sarney declared he would respond to Collor de Mello's
accusations with an address on national television.
   Santos' candidacy also was denounced by other leaders among the
22 presidential candidates.
   In a televised debate Sunday night, Leonel Brizola of the
center-left Democratic Labor Party called Santos ``a test-tube
candidate'' of the Sarney administration.
   Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftist Workers Party compared
the Santos candidacy to a ``coup d'etat'' against the electoral
process.
   Both Sarney and Santos, conservative candidate of the new
Brazilian Municipalist Party, deny allegations that they are
engaged in a joint political effort.
   Sarney, who by law cannot run for re-election, opposes Collor de
Mello and polls have shown that Santos' late entry in the race
caused a sharp reduction in Collor de Mello's lead.
   Santos presented his candidacy officially to the Superior
Electoral Court on Saturday, and it is being challenged.
   A law decreed in 1970, when Brazil was under a military
dictatorship, that directors of government-licensed businesses,
such as television stations and networks, must resign from such
positions at least three months before elections if they are
candidates.
   Santos' lawyers say although he is the main stockholder in the
SBT network he is not an active director and the law should not
apply to him.
   Jose Francsco Rezek, president of the seven-member electoral
court, said the tribunal would rule on the legality of Santos'
candidacy by Friday.
   Rezek noted the 1970 law was adopted during military rule and
said the main issue for the electoral court will be to determine
which points of that law ``have survived'' under Brazil's new
constitution written in 1988.
   Santos is not among the 22 candidates listed on the ballots,
which have gone out to Brazil's 250,000 polling stations. To vote
for Santos, Brazilians will have to draw an `X' through the box
next to the name of Armando Correa, the Municipalist Party
candidate who withdrew to be replaced by Santos.
   If no candidate gets a majority a runoff will be held between
the two top vote-getters.

   Amnesty International appealed Monday to El
Salvador to investigate the bombing of a trade union office in San
Salvador.
   Ten people were killed and 29 were injured Oct. 31 when a bomb
exploded at the headquarters of the National Federation of
Salvadoran Workers.
   The attack came a day after leftist guerrillas bombarded the
Defense Ministry compound with mortar shells, killing one person
and wounding 15, most of them civilians.
   Amnesty International said human rights sources claimed that
Defense Minister Gen. Rafael Humberto Larios made a statement that
the labor movement would suffer the consequences of the attack on
the ministry.
   The London-based rights group said the attacks in San Salvador
``were not isolated incidents but took place in the context of
escalating human rights violations against members of trade unions
and grassroots organizations perceived by the government as
sympathetic to the guerrillas.''
   Amnesty said it was appealing to President Alfredo Cristiani
``to guarantee the physical security of trade unionists following
persistent reports of violent attacks on trade union premises, and
arbitrary arrests, torture and `disappearances' of trade unionists
in recent months.''
   Left-wing guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front have been battling the government for 10 years.

   A Navy A-6E jet bomber crashed into the
Strait of Juan de Fuca on Monday after its two crew members
parachuted to safety, the Navy said.
   In Nevada, an F-15 fighter jet from Nellis Air Force Base
crashed about 60 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The pilot ejected
safely, a base spokesman said.
   The Navy A-6E plane, built by Grumman as a carrier-borne bomber,
went into the water west of the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station,
the Navy said.
   The jet experienced mechanical problems before the crew ejected,
Navy spokeswoman Mariana Graham said.
   Base spokesman Howard Thompson identified the crew as pilot
Cmdr. Harold Starling, 36, and bombardier-navigator Lt. Chris
Eagle, 26. Starling is from Virginia Beach, Va., while Eagle's
hometown is Wheaton, Md.
   Thompson said the two crew members were picked up and taken to
the base hospital on the Whidbey Island base just north of Oak
Harbor, 50 miles north of Seattle. They suffered only minor
injuries and were listed in satisfactory condition with minor cuts
and bruises, said Thompson.
   The A-6E class of jets are known as Intruders for their ability
to fly low and for flying in inclement weather.
   The Strait of Juan de Fuca separates Washington state from
British Columbia's Vancouver Island.
   Two crewmen were killed in early August while practicing for an
air show at the Whidbey Island base. Since 1980, 13 of the Whidbey
Island A-6 class of jets have crashed, killing 14.
   The pilot in the Nevada crash was identified as Lt. Col. Richard
Banholzer. He was treated for a minor scrape. The cause of the
crash was unknown, said Sgt. J.C. Marcom, a Nellis spokesman.

   L. Douglas Wilder, campaigning for the job
that would make him the nation's first elected black governor,
rallied supporters Monday with a warning against overconfidence
because of his lead in polls.
   Wilder's opponent, former Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman,
dismissed the polls putting him behind, saying his organization
showed enough support to win on Tuesday and that undecided voters
were moving his way.
   As the candidates made flying tours to hit Virginia's major TV
markets on the eve of the election, campaign workers staffed
telephone banks to urge supporters to vote. Weather could be a
factor, with forecasters predicting clouds and possibly rain but
temperatures in the 60s.
   Wilder, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, went on the
stump with Gov. Gerald L. Baliles and former Gov. Charles S. Robb,
now a U.S. senator. Also along were his two running mates,
businessman Donald S. Beyer Jr. for lieutenant governor, and
incumbent Attorney General Mary Sue Terry.
   Baliles cannot seek a second consecutive term under the state
constitution.
   At a morning stop in Roanoke, Wilder said he felt ``exceedingly
good'' about the chances for a Democratic sweep of the state's top
three offices.
   But he also played down a Richmond Times-Dispatch poll Sunday
showing him 9 percent ahead of Coleman, his Republican opponent,
with 19 percent undecided.
   ``The only polls that count are the polls taken tomorrow when
all the polls are closed,'' Wilder said.
   ``Turnout is very important,'' he said. ``Every Democratic
election here has to depend on turnout and hopefully it will be
there tomorrow.''
   He urged his followers not only to cast their ballots but to ask
others to vote and drive people to the polls.
   ``Let's be certain that we get out and, as Chuck would say, haul
and call,'' Wilder told the enthusiastic crowd.
   Later, at a rally at the state Capitol during a steady drizzle,
Wilder pointed to the sky and said everything was sunny. ``It's
only in perception,'' he said.
   Coleman, flanked by his son Sean and U.S. Sen. John W. Warner,
told about two dozen supporters at a Richmond airport rally that he
has the most effective grassroots organization in state history and
that his workers were out to ``energize the precinct organization.''
   He said his campaign has identified 650,000 Republican or
Republican-leaning voters, and those people will be called and
urged to vote.
   ``We're absolutely on the eve of a great victory,'' said
Coleman, who also was joined in Richmond by the GOP candidate for
attorney general, state Sen. Joseph B. Benedetti. The GOP candidate
for lieutenant governor is state Sen. Edwina P. Dalton.
   Coleman stressed his law enforcement experience as the state's
former attorney general, his opposition to higher taxes and his
ties to the Bush administration in saying he believes Virginians
want a change.
   ``Our tracking shows the undecideds are breaking our way,''
Coleman said. ``All we have to do is get the vote out.''

   A strike called by Gen. Michel Aoun, the
Christian army commander, virtually closed down east Beirut on
Monday and his followers filled the streets to protest the election
of a Syrian-backed president.
   Rioting Aoun loyalists stormed the residence of Nasrallah Sfeir,
the Maronite Catholic patriarch, who supported Rene Mouawad's
election as president Sunday, and forced him to kiss a portrait of
the general. Mouawad, 64, and Aoun, 54, are Maronites, the main
Christian sect in Lebanon.
   Aoun declared a ``war of liberation'' this year on the 40,000
Syrian soldiers stationed in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League. He issued a statement Monday urging
supporters to ``limit your protests to civilized and peaceful
methods.''
   Schools, shops, restaurants, banks and government offices closed
in Christian east Beirut and many parts of the Christian enclave
north and east of the city.
   Patriarch Sfeir, 68, fled to his summer home in an area of north
Lebanon under Syrian control and said he would not return to his
official residence on the wooded slopes of Bkirki ``until peace
prevails.''
   Lebanese police issued a statement saying they ``ensured the
patriarch's safe drive'' early Monday to Diman, 52 miles north of
Bkirki.
   ``We plead with God to forgive'' the attackers, Sfeir said at
Diman, where he was greeted by Mouawad, Parliament speaker Hussein
Husseini, Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria and many
legislators.
   A police spokesman said 100 supporters of Aoun drove to Bkirki
in 30 cars shortly after midnight Sunday and stormed the walled
compound. A 40-man unit of Aoun's command assigned to protect Sfeir
did not try to stop them, said the spokesman, whose name was
withheld under standing regulations.
   ``The rioters broke into the patriarch's bedroom, dragged him
out of bed, forced him to kneel with two senior aides who rushed to
help him and forced them all to kiss posters of Aoun,'' the
spokesman said.
   Other Aoun loyalists broke into at least six churches in the
Christian enclave to protest Mouawad's election. The spokesman said
they fired automatic weapons into the air, ``burned rubber tires at
several churches and rang bells.''
   Pro-Aoun rioters went into the streets hours after legislators,
forced out of Beirut by the general's threat to shell the Pariament
building, convened in the Syrian-controlled north Sunday and
elected Mouawad.
   On Saturday, Aoun said he was dissolving the legislature. He and
acting Prime Minster Salim Hoss have led rival Christian and Moslem
governments for 14 months, since President Amin Gemayel's six-year
term ended without agreement by Parliament on a successor.
   The new president, a moderate lawyer, met Monday with spiritual
leaders and politicians to try to form a national reconciliation
government capable of ending the 14-year-old civil war.
   Arab states and several Western nations welcomed his election,
including the Gulf Cooperation Council of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Foreign
ministers of the 12-nation European Community congratulated Mouawad
and urged that foreign armies withdraw from Lebanon.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Canberra, Australia,
for a 12-nation meeting on Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, told
reporters, ``We support the election for president and we support
the Taif agreements _ and the enforcement of the Taif agreements.''
   Lebanese legislators drafted a peace plan at meetings last month
in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   A statement from the Soviet Foreign Ministry said Lebanon had
made ``an important move toward restoring constitutional
institutions.'' U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
expessed hope ``the Lebanese people can at long last look forward
to the return of peace, tranquility and normalcy.''
   When rioters arrived at the Maronite patriarch's residence, the
police spokesman said, Sfeir tried to talk them into leaving ``but
they were hysterical.''
   He said some entered the small church in the compound ``and
desecrated it by smashing benches and throwing sand and rocks on
the carpets and paintings.''
   They tore down pictures of the patriarch and Pope John Paul II
and put up Aoun posters, ``placed a poster of Aoun on the
patriarch's chair and used dirty words against the patriarch,'' the
spokesman said.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
expressed shock at the raid. ``We strongly deplore the
mistreatments that were suffered by the Patriarch Sfeir,'' he said.
   Aoun also rejected the peace plan Parliament adopted Sunday,
which was worked out in weeks of negotiations in Taif, because it
lacks a timetable for Syrian withdrawal.
   He has refused to surrender the presidential palace at Baabda, a
Christian suburb of Beirut, to the new president. Aoun lives in a
bunker beneath the palace, which was heavily damaged during a
six-month artillery war that began in March between Aoun's troops
and a Moslem alliance led by the Syrians.
   Asked whether the general would vacate the bunker, an aide said
privately Monday: ``You must be kidding. The general does not
recognize the election. How would he turn over the palace, the
symbol of legitimacy, to someone whom he doesn't recognize as the
legitimate president?''

   The candidates vying to succeed Edward I. Koch
as mayor made a final pitch Monday, with Rudolph Giuliani calling
the election ``a referendum on integrity'' because of questions
about front-runner David Dinkins' finances.
   Tuesday's election will give the city either its first
Republican mayor since John Lindsay in 1965, Giuliani, or its first
black mayor ever, Dinkins, who defeated Koch in the Democratic
primary.
   Dinkins leads by about 15 percentage points in polls despite
revelations about the Democrat's personal and campaign finances
that Giuliani said cast doubt on Dinkins' honesty and character.
   ``So many serious questions have been raised about my opponent
that this election has become a referendum on integrity,'' Giuliani
said during a busy day of campaigning.
   ``David Dinkins has a history of getting away with things that
others don't get away with,'' Giuliani added.
   Dinkins made several appearances, shrugging off Giuliani's
charges as signs of desperation. Dinkins repeated his themes of
unity and vowed not to allow the city to become ``a Republican
beachhead,'' a term used by President Bush.
   ``Of course, I'm pleased at the progress we're making,'' he told
reporters, adding, ``I won't be happy until the last ballot is
counted tomorrow _ assuming, of course, it results in a victory for
our side.''
   Dinkins accused Giuliani, the former federal prosecutor in
Manhattan, of making ``loose allegations'' and running a negative
campaign.
   He said Giuliani entered the mayoral race ``like a knight in
shining armor on a white charger. I suggest that the armor is a bit
tarnished and that charger is no longer white.''
   Dinkins' campaign has been dogged in recent weeks by accusations
of financial transgressions, including the sale of cable-television
stock he once valued at $1 million to his son for $58,000, his
failure to file tax returns for four years 20 years ago and the
payment of $9,500 to an ex-convict to get out the vote in the
primary.
   The latest allegation was that Dinkins failed to list on
financial disclosure or tax forms that a friend paid in part for a
trip to France last year. Dinkins said Monday that he was trying to
determine if the gift exceeded a $500 minimum that would require
its listing.
   Later, Dinkins said part of the air fare was paid by the friend
through a hotel bonus program, similar to a frequent-flier program,
and had no cash value. Dinkins said it is not clear whether such a
gift must be listed on financial disclosure forms, but said he
would amend his statement.
   ``He is less than candid, he hides, he evades,'' Giuliani
charged. ``You finally confront him with it, he hides, he evades.
... This had to be dragged out of David Dinkins.''
   Giuliani also has accused Dinkins of accepting cruises from
unions, but Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, said they
were related to city business.
   ``Trust is a very important word in government,'' Giuliani said.
``It's at the heart of American democracy. It's at the core of this
election. ... We must be able to trust our mayor.''
   The candidates met in two televised debates over the weekend,
with Dinkins saying voters ``don't want a prosecutor, they want a
mayor.'' Giuliani said they ``want a mayor who has nothing to fear
from a prosecutor.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Aquino Says Military Action Not Solution to Insurgency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines said
on Monday she does not believe military action is the answer to the
communist insurgency in her homeland.
   She is on an eight-day visit to Canada and the United States and
made the remark at a meeting with about 70 Filipinos in a Toronto
hotel before coming to Ottawa.
   Mrs. Aquino is to meet Tuesday with Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney and sign several Canadian-Philippine agreements before
leaving for the United States.
   At the meeting with Philippine expatriates in Toronto's Royal
York Hotel, she was handed a letter asking her government to
negotiate a settlement with communist rebels and suspend
counterinsurgency operations.
   She said her government is committed to protecting human rights
and that she believes a military solution to the revolt, now in its
21st year, is not the answer.
   ``We have to address the socio-economic needs of our country,
which we are doing,'' she said.
   Outside the hotel about 25 demonstrators demanded that Mrs.
Aquino allow the body of former President Ferdinand Marcos to be
returned to the Philippines for burial.
   ``Bring home Marcos!,'' a few demonstrators shouted as Mrs.
Aquino left the hotel. She did not respond.
   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28. Mrs. Aquino became
president after a popular civilian-military uprising ousted Marcos
in February 1986.
   It was the first time since Mrs. Aquino began her visit in
Vancouver Saturday that Marcos loyalists had confronted her.
   In Toronto, Mrs. Aquino encouraged investments in the
Philippines, first at a meeting with bankers at the Bank of Nova
Scotia and later in a speech to the Empire and Canadian clubs.
   She said Canadian investment in oil exploration to help the
Philippines secure its energy needs would especially be welcome.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses $50 Million Humperdinck Libel Suit Against Enquirer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed a $50 million lawsuit
brought by Engelbert Humperdinck against The National Enquirer,
which reported that the mother of the singer's daughter feared he
had the AIDS virus.
   U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall dismissed the libel
lawsuit last week, said Humperdinck attorney Robert Rotstein.
Rotstein said Humperdinck would appeal.
   Humperdinck, 53, has tested negative for the virus that causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Rotstein said.
   Mike Walker, a National Enquirer editor, said Monday that the
Lantana, Fla.-based newspaper stood behind the article, which he
said was based on a court filing and was therefore not libelous.
   ``In our Dec. 27, 1988, issue, we published a story describing
how the mother of Engelbert's illegitimate child charged in a legal
proceeding that the singer had the AIDS virus,'' Walker said. ``We
reported the allegation in an accurate and truthful manner and now
we feel vindicated by the judge's verdict.''
   The headline, ``Mother of His Child Claims in Court ...
Engelbert Has AIDS Virus,'' was totally accurate, the Enquirer
maintained, published only after being closely reviewed by legal
counsel.
   Kathy Jetter filed papers in New York City's Family Court
demanding that Humperdinck provide for the financial future of her
12-year-old daughter, already ruled by a court to be his daughter.
   Humperdinck's lawsuit said the woman's claims about him were
false and unsubstantiated and that they were ultimately dismissed
by the New York court.
   Humperdinck claimed the Enguirer's story was false and malicious.
   The National Enquirer is a weekly supermarket tabloid that
boasts the largest circulation of any paper in America.

   The U.S. Supreme Court's decision Monday
that a Rhode Island woman cannot let her boyfriend stay overnight
while her children are in the house has sexist overtones, the
American Civil Liberties Union said.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Carla
Parrillo's rights were not violated by a judge's order forbidding
her from having overnight male guests while her children are home.
   ``I would be surprised if judges were as willing to serve as
moral guardians of a family where a man is involved,'' said Steven
Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island ACLU chapter.
   Ms. Parrillo and her husband, Justin Jr., were divorced in May
1986 after seven years of marriage. The Johnston woman was given
custody of her children and her husband was given visitation rights.
   Ms. Parrillo said her ex-husband began to harass her when he
learned she was dating Joseph DiPippo. She asked for a court order
limiting Parrillo's visitation rights, requiring him to see the
children, then aged 8, 10 and 13, at specific times away from the
home.
   Parrillo countered by asking the court to bar Ms. Parrillo from
having overnight male guests, and Family Court Judge William
Goldberg in November 1986 barred Ms. Parrillo from allowing any
unrelated males to stay overnight when the children are home.
   Permitting DiPippo to stay overnight with Ms. Parrillo is not
``a suitable arrangement for the children to be put into,'' said
Goldberg, who has since retired.
   Attorneys for Ms. Parrillo said Goldberg's order was based on a
presumption, without any evidence, that allowing DiPippo to stay
overnight would cause the children psychological harm.
   Neither side called experts to testify about the psychological
effect of the visits on the children. The children told Goldberg in
a private meeting that they all got along well with DiPippo,
although the eldest child, a boy, said there were times he did not
like the man.
   Goldberg also noted that if Ms. Parrillo married DiPippo, the
issue would become moot, although Ms. Parrillo, 33, had told the
court she did not plan to marry in the near future.
   Ms. Parrillo could not be reached for comment Monday. Her
telephone number is not listed and her ACLU attorney, Patricia
Hurst, said she had not spoken with her client.
   Earlier this year, when the state Supreme Court upheld
Goldberg's order, Ms. Parrill said she was no longer dating DiPippo
but had a new boyfriend whom she intended to invite for overnight
visits, even if it meant risking jail.
   Thomas DeSimone, an attorney for Parrillo, said Monday that he
was not surprised by the ruling.
   ``I didn't think that there was a federal question involved,''
he said.
   Brown said he felt the high court chose not to review the case
because there are not similar cases elsewhere and it was ``simply a
strange little case from Rhode Island that didn't deserve the full
court's attention.''
   The case is Parrillo vs. Parrillo, 89-75.

<HEAD>Government Says Nothing In Report Suggests Hess Was Murdered</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Rhodri is cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government solicitor-general said Monday there
is nothing to suggest in a British policeman's report on the prison
death of Rudolf Hess in 1987 that Adolf Hitler's World War II
deputy was murdered.
   Detective Chief Superintendent Howard Jones, the policeman
heading an official inquiry into Hess' death in Berlin's Spandau
Prison, sad earlier this year that discrepancies in evidence
merited a full criminal investigation.
   But Sir Nicholas Lyell told the House of Commons on Monday,
``Inquiries carried out by (Jones) have produced no cogent evidence
to suggest that Rudolf Hess was murdered, nor, in the view of the
director of public prosecutions, is there any basis for further
investigation.''
   Hess died on Aug. 17, 1987 at age 93. The governments of the
United States and America's three wartime allies, Britain, France
and the Soviet Union, ruled formally that Hess committed suicide by
hanging himself from a window latch.
   His body was found in a garden hut in the grounds of the prison,
where he had been the sole inmate since 1966. Family members, among
others, expressed doubts that Hess killed himself.
   Legislator Rhodri Morgan of the opposition Labor Party, who
prompted the solicitor-general's statement by asking what action
was to be taken on Jones' report, told the Commons the government
ruling was ``deeply disappointing for anybody interested in the
truth.''
   Hess was captured after flying to Scotland in 1941 in a
self-proclaimed bid to end the war. He was convicted in 1945 as a
war criminal and sentenced to life imprisonment.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Monday that
immigration court proceedings must be translated in full for
non-English speakers facing deportation and exclusion hearings.
   U.S. District Judge William Gray ruled that the current policy,
which provides only for translation of questions to non-English
speakers and their responses, violates statutory and constitutional
rights.
   Sandra Pettit of the Legal Aid Foundation said the ruling will
give those facing such hearings the ability to understand and
participate.
   ``The proceeding won't be something that is just done to them,''
she said.
   Gray rejected a request by government lawyers that the ruling be
put on hold while they appealed, Ms. Pettit said.
   Ms. Pettit represents two refugee rights groups, El Rescate and
the Central American Refugee Center and five individuals, three of
whom speak Spanish and two Farsi, the main language in Iran.
   All five were involved in immigration proceedings, and in March
1988 filed suit claiming that immigration court proceedings were
incompletely and poorly translated.
   The suit was filed against the Executive Office of Immigration
Review, the branch of the Justice Department that oversees
immigration courts, as well as others including U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.
   Gray granted a summary judgment on their claim that the
translations were incomplete. A second claim, that court
interpreters are poorly trained and unqualified, likely will go to
trial early next year, Ms. Pettit said.

   Richard Maltby Jr. and David Shire spin highly
personal stories through song.
   They did it in the off-Broadway revue ``Starting Here, Starting
Now'' in 1977 and in the musical ``Baby,'' a modest Broadway
success nearly six years ago.
   Now another collection of their musical tales is on display in
``Closer Than Ever,'' a pint-sized but emotionally potent revue
that opened Monday at off-Broadway's Cherry Lane Theatre.
   Their terrific songs come from a grab bag of sources. Some were
dropped from ``Baby'' before it opened in New York. Others appeared
in a topical revue, ``Urban Blight,'' done at the Manhattan Theatre
Club. And several were created specifically for this new show.
   What Maltby and Shire chronicle in their nearly two dozen
numbers is choice and change _ people coming to terms with their
choices and changes involving husbands, wives, lovers, children,
parents and, most importantly, themselves.
   If that makes the show sound gloomy and a bit pompous, it isn't.
``Closer Than Ever'' is an exhilarating musical revue that
reaffirms one's belief that the American musical theater isn't dead
yet.
   Shire's music sounds contemporary, but it is more than a
collection of pop melodies. Maltby's lyrics are intelligent and
often witty, yet never intricate for the sake of being tricky.
Together, they turn what could be just songs into one of the finest
scores of the year.
   Three numbers anchor the show. In ``One of the Good Guys,'' a
married man wonders what it would have been like if he had cheated
on his wife and not done ``the right thing.'' In the devastating
``Life Story,'' a woman looks back on the choices she made about
marriage and career. And in the highly emotional ``If I Sing,'' a
son thanks his father for introducing him to music.
   Several very funny songs spice up the production. In ``The Bear,
the Tiger, the Hamster and the Mole,'' the mating habits of man are
compared _ unfavorably _ to the mating habits of animals. And
``Another Wedding Song'' may be the first wedding salute to second
marriages.
   The performers _ Brent Barrett, Sally Mayes, Richard Muenz and
particularly Lynne Wintersteller _ are enormously appealing. They
are the kind of singers who should be in Broadway shows every
season if Broadway were still producing musicals like this.
   The quartet gets yeoman support from pianist and musical
director Patrick Scott Brady. Maltby, who directed the show with
Steven Scott Smith, moves the cast briskly through their numbers,
and the pace rarely falters.
   The setting, a takeoff of a painting by Belgian surrealist Rene
Magritte, features a blue sky, clouds and an open door, framed by
musical notation. It's a tantalizing bit of imagery that suggests
life's possibilities. ``Closer Than Ever'' doesn't make those
choices seem unlimited, but it suggests that most of the fun _ and
some of the pain _ is in the trying.

<HEAD>U.S. Denounces Drift Net Fishing as Devastating</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States joined South Pacific
nations on Monday in denouncing drift net fishing as a
``potentially devastating technology'' that kills marine mammals,
sea birds and fish.
   Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have made extensive use of the
nets in the Pacific Ocean to catch squid.
   Drift nets can be 30 miles wide and a U.S. delegate, Ambassador
Jonathan Moore, said they ``catch every living thing with which
they come in contact, with the exception of fish small enough to
pass through the mesh size.''
   Moore told a General Assembly committee the United States will
join 11 other nations in sponsoring a resolution that would ban
large drift nets.
   The measure would abolish drift net fishing immediately in the
South Pacific and phase it out worldwide by June 30, 1992.
   Moore said the United States does not object to developing
nations using small drift nets that allow fish to multiply and
renew the stock.
   But he said the use of vast drift nets is ``an inherently
indiscriminate and potentially devastating technology.''
   He told the committee such nets violate the principle of
sustainable development by harvesting and killing fish and marine
life faster than they can reproduce.
   Sponsoring the resolution on drift net fishing along with the
United States are New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Fiji, Mauritania,
Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Zaire, Colombia and
Sweden.
   It does not single out any nation for criticism, but expresses
concern about the indiscriminate nature of drift net fishing and
sets out proposals for international management and the eventual
ban of the nets.
   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer of New Zealand told the General
Assembly last month that drift nets are ``walls of death'' and that
their use has depleted salmon stocks in the North Pacific.
   In Seattle, six Western states and the province of British
Columbia issued a proclamation at a news conference urging their
federal governments to act to reduce drift net fishing in the North
Pacific.
   The proclamation was issued by the states of Alaska, Washington,
Oregon, Idaho, California and Hawaii and by British Columbia and
was announced during the meeting in Seattle of the International

<HEAD>Anthony Quinn Experiences Chest Pains, Withdraws From Play</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chest pains forced actor Anthony Quinn to
withdraw from a production of ``A Walk in the Woods'' less than a
week before the play's opening night, organizers said.
   Quinn's withdrawal Saturday forced cancellation of previews
scheduled for Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday at Syracuse Stage.
   ``It became clear he could not handle the show,'' said Barry
Weisler, the play's co-producer. ``He ... won't be permitted to
travel until he is out of pain and the doctor gives his approval.
It is clear that he must undergo a full and careful examination.''
   Syracuse Stage officials said there was no diagnosis, but the
74-year-old actor had been experiencing chest pains and last week
asked for the name of a cardiologist.
   Susan Chicoine, a New York City spokeswoman for Weisler, said
Monday that Quinn would be ``going in for complete checkup. He does
have a heart condition.''
   She said the actor was under the care of his personal physician
in New York City. The spokeswoman declined to elaborate.
   Director Arthur Storch said Saturday that he learned Quinn was
ill when the actor's wife, Yolanda, called him that morning. Storch
was later told that Quinn had gone to a hospital for a checkup,
then returned to his Syracuse hotel.
   Storch said he realized early last week Quinn was in pain.
   ``We were rehearsing the scene in which the Soviet diplomat has
an angina attack and Tony said, `I know what that is. I have it.'
And we talked about it,'' the director said.
   Quinn was to portray a Soviet diplomat in the play, which is
about the friendship developing between two Soviet and U.S. arms
negotiators.
   ``A Walk in the Woods'' had been scheduled for three weeks in
Syracuse before going on tour through April, but Storch said he was
skeptical the tour would go on.
   Ben Hammer, who played the Soviet diplomat last season, will
replace Quinn in the cast.
   The first preview was set for Thursday, and the play was to open
as scheduled on Friday.

<HEAD>Economic Retrenchment Closes 1 Million Chinese Rural Factories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1 million rural factories, one of the great
success stories of China's past decade of reforms, have shut down
this year because of government austerity policies.
   Hundreds of thousands of other rural enterprises either stopped
production or shifted to making other goods since the year began,
the official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday, quoting Agriculture
Ministry officials.
   The China Daily said in a related report that the number of
private business people in China fell from 14.5 million at the end
of 1988 to 12.3 million now as a result of the economic slowdown
and Beijing's determination to tighten controls over the private
sector.
   Xinhua did not say how many people lost their jobs as a result,
and the government has not addressed the issue of rising rural
unemployment.
   Government officials have said unemployment will double from 2
percent on Jan. 1, 1989, to 4 percent on Dec. 31, but those figures
refer only to urban workers. Laid-off rural workers can return to
farming, the government says.
   Fast-growing rural enterprises and private business have made
major contributions in the past decade, by providing services and
goods the inefficient state-run economy can't handle and by
providing millions of jobs for surplus farm workers.
   At the end of 1988, China had 18.8 million rural enterprises
employing nearly 100 million people. Total output value last year
was $175 billion, up about 40 percent from 1987, exceeding the
nation's agricultural output value and accounting for a quarter of
that of the entire country.
   Rural enterprises, however, have been a loser in the year-old
austerity program under which the government has cut credit and
given priority to state-run enterprises in alloting scarce energy
and raw material resources.
   The government has called for large-scale readjustment of rural
factories, citing widespread problems in poor management,
duplication of production, waste of energy and materials, severe
pollution and poor quality products.
   The Agriculture Ministry said no new rural enterprises will be
allowed to open over the next two or three years except those
producing goods for exports; those supplying energy or materials
industries or big industries; those producing daily goods in short
supply, or those making agricultural equipment.
   The China Daily said that despite the sharp drop in private
entrepreneurs, the government stands by its policy of encouraging
supervised growth of the private sector and allowing some people to
``become prosperous first through honest labor and lawful
dealings.''
   It quoted a government official as saying the state wants the
private sector involved in food and drink, repair work, handicraft
and service industries that are not profitable for state and
collective enterprises.
   Most private business people now are involved in commerce. Only
15.5 percent are in service and food industries.
   The official said tax collection on individual incomes must be
improved to ``readjust the staggering profits some private
entrepreneurs make and to hold back upstarts.''
   Tax evasion is pandemic, with 90 percent of Shanghai's private
entrepreneurs not paying taxes.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting City Council President Ben Woods was
convicted Monday of an array of racketeering and extortion charges,
just hours after the veteran politician resigned from the council.
   A U.S. District Court jury found Woods guilty of 17 of 22
counts, including two counts of conspiracy, seven counts of
extortion, one count of racketeering, five counts of income tax
evasion and two counts of filing false tax returns.
   Woods was accused of taking $19,600 in payments from businesman
Michael Hartman to help the contractor get city housing contracts
and expedite payments on a project Hartman had before the city
Housing Authority.
   Prosecutors also alleged that Woods accepted $36,727 from Joseph
Wozniak, a former Westmoreland County businessman. In return, they
said, Woods used his influence to help Wozniak sell concrete
sealants to several city agencies.
   During testimony in his own defense, Woods said he received
commissions of 5 percent or 10 percent, depending on how much
sealer Wozniak sold.
   Hartman, 38, of Pleasant Hills was convicted of one count each
of conspiracy, racketeering and filing false corporate tax returns.
Hartman's Ablebuilt Construction Co. was convicted of a single
count of racketeering.
   Judge Alan N. Bloch dismissed four counts of extortion against
Woods and one count of filing a false 1984 corporate tax return
against Hartman because the jury could not reach a unanimous
verdict on those counts.
   The jury also found Woods innocent of one count of extortion.
   The panel will reconvene Tuesday to hear additional testimony in
order to decide how much of the profits the three defendants must
forfeit. Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, they could be required to forfeit up to three
times what they received as a result of their illegal activity.
   The defendants face a maximum of three years in jail on each of
the counts of filing false tax returns, five years for each of the
conspiracy and tax evasion counts and a maximum of 20 years for
each of the racketeering and extortion counts.
   Wozniak, a government witness, was granted immunity from
prosecution.
   Woods, 47, was elected acting council president when Sophie
Masloff left the post. She became mayor in May 1988 when Mayor
Richard Caliguiri died.
   Woods opened Monday's council meeting and led a silent prayer,
then announced his resignation, effective immediately.
   ``For the past eight years, I have always attempted to represent
this great and proud city in a manner in which I felt to be
consistent with its best interests,'' Woods said. ``Now, however,
with the serious and important business of budget deliberations
about to begin, the nagging and persistent controversy still being
played out threatens to interfere with and diminish the attention
that the budget process deserves.''

   As a new round of high-level economic talks
opened Monday, Japan criticized Wall Street's flurry of corporate
takeovers as an example of U.S. short-term business strategy
harmful to the economy and to America's own competitive interests.
   The U.S. side replied that certain takeovers ``perhaps have gone
too far,'' but maintained that leveraged buyouts play an important
role in recycling assets, a U.S. official said.
   Japan took the offensive at the opening of the two-day round of
structural talks the two countries have agreed to hold every two
months in a new search for solutions to their multibillion-dollar
trade imbalance.
   As host of the meeting, the United States takes its turn as
critic on Tuesday, planning to highlight Japanese infrastructure
defects, anticompetitive pricing and distribution practices that
discriminate against imports and penalize Japanese consumers, said
senior U.S. administration officials who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   The session will end with release of a joint study by the two
governments showing that consumers in Tokyo and Osaka must pay
substantially more for the same goods than those in New York and
Chicago, the officials said. Prices of 140 items made in Japan, the
United States and third countries were checked.
   President Bush announced the SII, or Structural Impediment
Initiative, talks in May, saying they should be a two-way street.
   They started in Tokyo in September and aim to produce by early
1990 a preliminary report and by July a final report on structural
and lifestyle problems contributing to the $50 billion annual U.S.
trade deficit with Japan.
   The ideal result, a U.S. official said, would be the emergence
of ``some new patterns of behavior in both our countries so that
... the U.S. is much more competitive and so that on the Japanese
side their economy is much more open.''
   The Japanese side has been criticizing U.S. emphasis on
short-term profits as an example of corporate behavior that hurts
U.S. competitiveness and staying power in the complicated Japanese
market.
   According to a U.S. official, the Japanese voiced concern Monday
that ``leveraged buyout activity in the United States in a way
reflects the short timeframe with which business managers view
their ongoing businesses and the decision-making process ... they
see it in many ways as being counterproductive to the long-term
health of the economy and to business.''
   The U.S. reply, he added, was that ``we view the issue with a
tinge of concern because ... certain (cases) have perhaps gone too
far (but) ... not overly concerned because we see a very important
and viable place in the economy for leveraged buyouts, in the sense
that they recycle mature assets, they represent a recapitalization
of mature industries.
   ``I think they understood the arguments'' of the U.S. side, and
the issue will be discussed further, the official said.
   The U.S. officials said specific issues to be raised Tuesday
include an inadequate Japanese ``infrastructure for importing and
distributing foreign-manufactured products'' such as airports, air
and sea cargo facilities and superhighways, and the lack of
investment in medical facilities, sewer systems and parks.
   Most of the U.S. recommendations already have been made by
forward-looking Japanese organizations, so the talks are really ``a
win-win game'' rather than a ``zero-sum game,'' the officials said.

   Lech Walesa will not lay a wreath in Ottawa on
Armistice Day as he had requested, but the argument raged Monday
about who was to blame.
   The Canadian Labor Congress said Walesa, who founded Poland's
independent trade union Solidarity in 1980 and won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1983, was shut out by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Mulroney's office denied the charge, and the Foreign office said
the union federation decided Friday that Walesa would skip the
ceremonies at the cenotaph, or national monument to the dead, in
Ottawa.
   Walesa is to arrive Friday in Montreal for a four-day private
visit to Canada arranged by the labor federation. Walesa asked the
congress some time ago to arrange for him to lay a wreath Saturday
in the federal capital of Ottawa because Nov. 11 is Poland's
independence day.
   He had been tentatively scheduled to be in Ottawa Saturday for
the televised national observance of Remembrance Day, as Nov. 11 is
known in Canada, and return to Ottawa two days later for meetings
with Mulroney and other dignitaries.
   Now his schedule is to go to Toronto late Friday and on Saturday
place a wreath at the cenotaph in Toronto.
   Derik Hodgson, a labor congress spokesman, said Monday the
Foreign Office vetoed plans for Walesa to lay a wreath in Ottawa on
behalf of the federation's 2 million members and ``we were told
(the order) came from the prime minister's office.
   ``They said it would be a breach of protocol, that it would be
embarrassing to the prime minister if Walesa participated before he
officially meets with Mulroney.''
   Hodgson said meetings with Foreign Office officials were held
over a period of weeks and labor congress officials were told
repeatedly it was the prime minister's office that did not want
Walesa included in the national observances in Ottawa.
   ``I would hate to think it was because our prime minister was
vain and didn't want to share the stage with someone so well
known,'' Hodgson added.
   Mulroney will lay a wreath at the ceremonies on behalf of the
government of Canada.
   A different version was given by Gilbert Lavoie, the prime
minister's press secretary. He said Walesa was scheduled to meet
with Mulroney on Monday.
   Then last week the labor group asked if Walesa could instead
meet Mulroney on Saturday to accommodate a planned visit by Walesa
to Niagara Falls, Ont., on Monday, Lavoie said.
   ``We said no,'' said Lavoie. ``You don't change the prime
minister's schedule at the last minute because you're planning a
meeting in Niagara Falls.''
   Rejane Dodd of the Foreign Office said of the conflicting
accounts: ``I'm telling you what I've been told. I find it strange.
It's totally different. I doubt very much our people would give me
wrong information.''
   Hodgson claimed Murray Fairweather, director of the U.S.S.R. and
Eastern Europe division at the Foreign Office, threatened to cancel
Walesa's trip if the labor congress pressed the matter.
   Ms. Dodd said: ``Anybody is free to come to Canada. ... I don't
think you can cancel a visit like this.''

   Art Fletcher, President Bush's choice to
head the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, said Monday that he suffered
a mild heart attack last week and he expects to remain hospitalized
until Thursday.
   Fletcher, 64, said he still wants the Civil Rights Commission
job. He would succeed William B. Allen, whose resignation was
accepted by Bush last month.
   Fletcher was in Yakima to participate in a conference. He was
hospitalized Friday complaining of chest pains, and test results
over the weekend confirmed he suffered a mild heart attack, he said
in a statement.
   Jennifer Woodkey, a spokeswoman for St. Elizabeth Medical
Center, said Fletcher remained in satisfactory condition and was
resting.
   Flether also suffered a heart attack six years ago.

   Vladimir Horowitz, the legendary pianist who
dazzled the world for 60 years, was mourned upon his death as the
20th century's titan of the keyboard whose passing created a void
that can never be filled.
   The Russian-born virtuoso, who brought ``controlled thunder'' to
the piano and was a last link to the 19th century masters, died
Sunday at his Upper East Side home. He was 85.
   Horowitz left his native Russia in 1925 and came to the United
States in 1928, playing his first American concert seven days
later. He was an instant success.
   ``When he played, he'd turn on the current and it would hit sort
of like a shockwave,'' said Morton Gould, president of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``His performance had
that unique electricity that was magical.''

   The power of states to set stiff liability for
oil spills is the focus this week as the House votes on a measure
that became a top priority after the massive Exxon spill in
Alaska's Prince William Sound last spring.
   Months of wrangling have produced a bill praised widely for
moving the federal government forward on oil spill prevention and
reaction to spills, but criticized for banning the states from
enacting liability laws that go further than the proposed federal
limit.
   That issue, plus the question of when unlimited liability should
be imposed for negligence, is expected to be addressed during final
action on the bill, scheduled for Wednesday.
   In other business this week, party leaders will continue seeking
agreement on a crucial debt-limit extension, a deficit-reduction
bill and other measures. The government has reached its borrowing
limit of $2.8 trillion, and default will occur unless the ceiling
is extended early in the week.

   Candidates are sticking to negative themes entering today's
final day of the campaign for governor of Virginia and New Jersey
and mayor of New York, with Democrats sounding confident the
results will give them off-year political bragging rights.
   The campaigns of Democrats L. Douglas Wilder and David Dinkins
to score racial breakthroughs in Tuesday's elections are sharing
attention with the changing impact of abortion as a political issue.
   Bidding to become the first black elected governor of any state,
Wilder is battling Republican J. Marshall Coleman in a Virginia
contest in which race was rarely mentioned until the closing days.
   Republican Rudolph Giuliani said Sunday that if he is elected
mayor of New York he will order an investigation of Dinkins'
finances. Dinkins, bidding to be the first black mayor of the
nation's largest city, responded that former U.S. attorney Giuliani
``just can't get the prosecutor out of himself.''

   Mementos of white bigotry from
yesteryear _ Little Black Sambo dolls, ``Colored Only'' signs,
figurines of grinning, watermelon-eating urchins _ are becoming hot
collectors' items among American blacks who once scorned them as
hated symbols of humiliation.
   The booming market for ``black collectibles'' has attracted such
celebrities as Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg and
heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, who reportedly collects
African slave chains and shackles.
   ``Black people buy these items for the very same reason that
Jewish people research the Holocaust,'' says Jeanette B. Carson, a
prominent figure in the black memorabilia business. ``The black
experience, during and after slavery, was a Holocaust we must never
forget.''
   Ms. Carson, 56, a retired State Department specialist in African
affairs, began collecting black artifacts about seven years ago.
The 600 items that fill her home near Washington, D.C., range from
quilted dolls hand-sewn by former slaves to a mirrored mahogany hat
rack, valued at $800 to $900, which prize fighter Joe Louis once
kept in his dressing room.

   Republicans are bracing for a fierce fight

war that raged in the Reagan era.

it's going to be all-out, bloody war,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,

   Democratic senators are treading warily.
   ``I am one of those who has spoken out for more minority
representation on the courts, but I don't want ideologues,'' says
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who, like Hatch, is on the Senate
Judiciary Committee that will consider Thomas' nomination. ``Will
he apply the law or will he apply his philosophy?''

<TEXT>
   Twenty years ago, when Abdulla Salman was
a boy learning the sea, as many as 1,500 dhows plied the waters
around Bahrain. Today, only about 300 of the traditional craft
remain.
   ``Not too many Bahrainis like the sea so much anymore,'' said
Salman, whose fleet of five dhows makes him, at age 30, one of
Bahrain's hardiest survivors in a vanishing breed.
   The 8-year Iran-Iraq war in the Persian Gulf cut off Bahrain's
sea trade with Iran. That and the opening of a causeway linking
Bahrain, an island, with Saudi Arabia in 1986, dealt severe blows
to dhow operators already affected by modernization of shipping and
the virtual end of the pearling that once flourished here.
   However, nobody expects that the dhow, still built to a
centuries-old design, will become extinct _ Bahrain's government is
working to keep them afloat. But records at the port authority show
an 80 percent decline over the past 20 years.
   Abdulla Salman learned seamanship from his father, who once
worked on big cargo dhows, called booms, sailing to India and
Africa, and later ran ferries between Bahrain's islands.
   Salman the younger uses three of his dhows for commercial
fishing and hires out the others for picnics, dinner cruises and
excursions.
   The charter trade has picked up since the end of Iran-Iraq war
15 months ago.
   Among Salman's best customers now are U.S. sailors who, even
after weeks at sea, are eager to go fishing and teach Salman what
he calls ``interesting American expressions.''
   The circumstances are less bright for Abdul Ameer Al-Qaisi, one
of Bahrain's last remaining master dhow builders.
   After 30 years working at the craft handed down through six
generations of his family, Al-Qaisi struggles to make ends meet by
doing repairs and maintenance. He built his last dhow four years
ago, and sold it at a loss, he said.
   Only one of his six sons has shown even passing interest in
continuing the family tradition.
   ``This generation goes to school, then finds other jobs,'' he
said. ``Our people have been shipbuilders for generations. Now,
once a father dies, the children don't take over.''
   As far back as 2,500 B.C., Bahrain, then called Dilmun, was a
center for trade with Mesopotamia, the ancient name for what is now
Iraq, at the head of the Persian Gulf.
   Sumerian tablets tell of ships arriving from Dilmun with wood,
copper, and precious stones.
   A traditional dhow is distinguishable by its lateen sails or
raised deck at the stern.
   The big cargo dhows called booms are thought to be the original
design, but the most common type of dhow in the Persian Gulf today
is the banoosh, a smaller vessel used for fishing, cargo,
passengers and pleasure trips.
   Another is the jalibut, a sturdy but less graceful craft whose
name may be derived from the British ``jolly boat.''
   The sailing dhows have all but disappeared, as engine power
replaced the lateen sails used since the 4th century. Many modern
dhows have no masts.
   Dhows, however, do have some things in common. The keel is
almost always a single, squared-off log of teak.
   Another common feature is the absence of shelter or cabin space.
Fishermen and cargo handlers work, eat, sleep and pray on the
decks, regardless of weather.
   The only comforts may be the captain's wood-slat bed on the
quarterdeck and a toilet, a large box slung over the stern.
   Bahraini dhow builders are noted for their workmanship, and
some, shunning modern methods, still work ``from memory,'' with a
yardstick to measure and hand-made tools to drill, gouge, saw,
pound and plane. As a result, no two dhows are ever identical.
   Al-Qaisi is among the traditionalists, drilling holes with his
bow-drill, or mijdah, and sewing the planks together with hemp
rather than using nails or bolts.
   Bahrain's government, which compensated some dhow owners for
lost business after the causeway to Saudi Arabia opened, has
recently acquired a dhow for tourist excursions and is studying
ideas for reviving the pearling industry.
   Al-Qaisi hopes the government will find a way to encourage young
people to stay in the trade.
   Dhow builders, he said, ``don't really want to sit around and be
photographed by tourists. We want to do the work as before _ father
to son.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sitting on his favorite multicolored
rug in the shaded courtyard of his carpet factory, Aji Badghisi
remembers the good times _ when business was brisk and traders came
from afar seeking his rare designs and wools.
   Now, after more than a decade of war, Badghisi's carpet factory
is crumbling around him.
   His male employees have gone to war or fled Afghanistan. Young
boys and girls, no more than 13 years old, work in their place.
   Costs have skyrocketed with the current inflation. Cash that
took him through two months before the war began in 1979 lasts only
two weeks now. His weaving machines have shrunk from 200 to 20.
   Still, Ewaz Badghisi Ltd. survives. It is the last carpet
factory in Kabul, a city that once had scores.
   ``What can we do?'' said Badghisi, a small man with two gold
teeth and the hands of a craftsman. ``This is the life of my family
of generations. We know no other business.''
   Switching jobs wouldn't do.
   The war between the government and the Moslem guerrillas has
made Afghanistan's poor economy even poorer. Exports have dwindled
to almost nothing, and the civilian economy is completely dependent
on the Soviet Union.
   Carpets used to provided millions of dollars in revenue, about
40 percent of Afghanistan's export earnings. Now the industry is
losing out to carpet weavers in Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and China.
   Carpet weaving in Southwest Asia began thousands of years ago by
nomadic tribes that inhabited the valley on both sides of the Amu
Darya River dividing what is now the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.
   Rugs were traditionally knotted by women. Young girls acquired
the skill at home as they prepared their dowry of carpets, quilts,
cushions and wall hangings.
   The flourishing Silk Route, connecting Europe to India and
China, turned carpet weaving into a major industry and had a strong
influence on the rugs made in Afghanistan. Buddhist and Christian
motifs still show up in the patterns even though Islam was adopted
as the main religion of the Afghan tribes in the 9th and 10th
centuries.
   Various parts of Afghanistan became famous for their carpets.
   The Mauri style, said to be one of the world's finest, hails
from the northwestern province of Badghis, the home province of the
Badghisi family. Made from lustrous wool of the Kandahari sheep, a
Mauri carpet can have up to 60,000 knots in a square yard.
   The Baluch style from western Afghanistan is used in Moslem
prayer rugs, with its restrained tree-of-life and mosque motifs.
   Even after the communist takeover of Afghanistan in 1978, carpet
weaving remained primarily a village industry. Government attempts
to organize state-run concerns resulted in low-quality goods.
   Badghisi Ltd. survives because the family's native village is
under government control and is near the Soviet border. The company
organizes several journeys to the village each year to bring
carpets to Herat where they can be shipped to Kabul and then
exported to Western Europe, Japan and the United States.
   Lately the trip from the village to Kabul has become more
expensive. Gasoline is rare and becoming even rarer because the
rebels are shutting the roads in the north.
   In addition, wool from the Kandahari sheep has almost quadrupled
in cost.
   ``No one is herding sheep anymore,'' Badghisi said. ``They are
all either dead, fighting or refugees.''
   Production at the factory has also fallen sharply.
   ``Twelve years ago we had 1,000 workers here,'' he said. ``Now
we've got 100, and they are just children.''
   In one workshop, a group of boys were bent over a loom, slowly
knotting wool strands into a pattern of elephants and horses.
   ``I want to go to school, but there's no school,'' said
12-year-old Mohammad Amin. ``I want to fly my kite too, but my
family needs money.''
   Mohammad earns about 2,000 afghanis ($5) a month, enough to buy
about 15 pounds of flour when it's available in the markets.
   Badghisi sighs and runs his hands over the wildly colored
carpet, his favorite perch, in the factory's courtyard.
   ``We are all waiting for the war to end,'' he said. ``The young
need to play, and we need to make business.''

<HEAD>Bush's Summit Surprise: He Knew What He Was Doing All Along</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First by land, now by sea, President Bush has
delivered a pair of summit surprises that countered critics of a
foreign policy they term timid and he calls prudent. Each time, he
said the complaints didn't bother him because he knew exactly what
he was doing all along.
   It's happened twice within six months, in May with his proposal
to slash conventional arms in Europe, and now with his shipboard
conference planned for December with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Each time, Bush said that prolonged public criticism didn't faze
him because he knew what he wanted to do and how to do it. At one
point, the president even claimed he was immune to political
criticism.
   If so, he's the first.
   The two summit maneuvers, one West, one East, display the powers
a president wields in matters diplomatic _ although events can
overrule him. Jimmy Carter, in town for a weekend reunion of his
administration, can attest to that, 10 years after the Iranian
embassy hostage seizure that dominated his final year and
undermined his 1980 campaign.
   Indeed, Bush has his own experience with presidential limits, in
his attempt to force Manuel Noriega out of power in Panama.
   But in East-West diplomacy, he's succeeded in writing the agenda
so far, and Democratic critics are relatively quiet, if not
satisfied.
   In the first months of the Bush administration, there were
widespread complaints at home and among U.S. allies abroad at
administration silence while Gorbachev was scoring public opinion
points in western Europe with a series of arms control promises and
offers. Bush had ordered a review of U.S. foreign and defense
policies, and he waited it out without countering the Soviet
leader's peace offensive.
   Then, at the NATO summit in Brussels, he proposed swift and
drastic cuts in Soviet and U.S. conventional weapons in Europe.
Gorbachev had proposed reductions, too, over five or six years.
Bush wanted a deal negotiated in six months or a year, with the
actual reductions to follow in 1992 or 1993.
   His time frame is slipping, although Bush said last week that
the conventional arms negotiations are going ``reasonably well...
   ``We have to keep driving ... to be sure that we can keep moving
forward to meet a rather ambitious time frame,'' he said.
   Back when he announced the conventional arms proposals, there
was a told-you-so air to his comments about the critics. ``I know
that some voices were raised in Congress that we were going too
slow,'' he said on May 29. ``but we knew exactly what we were doing
all along ...'' That's almost exactly what he said on Oct. 31,
announcing the meeting with Gorbachev.
   In May and again in October, Bush said he had come under fire
for being reluctant to move, that people kept saying do something,
but that he insisted on taking his time and acting prudently.
   After Brussels and his midsummer trip to Poland and Hungary,
criticism of the Bush pace picked up again. Senate Democratic
Leader George Mitchell said the administration seemed more
comfortable with the certainties of the Cold War than with the
challenges of change in the governments and economies of the
once-solid communist bloc.
   Bush had said his goal was to overcome the division of Europe
and forge a new unity based on western values. The goal was
applauded, but as events moved that way, some Democrats said Bush
wasn't doing enough to support change.
   They were dissatisfied with the economic aid package he
recommended for Poland and Hungary, and Congress doubled it. They
thought he should be more assertive in dealing with Gorbachev, and
there were suggestions all summer that he ought to meet with the
Soviet leader. In September, the two governments agreed to a summit
meeting on strategic arms control in the United States next spring
or summer.
   The critics still deemed the president too passive. Then he
sprang his second surprise, an informal, preview meeting with
Gorbachev Dec. 2 and 3, aboard ships off Malta. Bush said he'd
planned it since the middle of the summer, but kept it secret from
all but the top echelons of the administration until the
simultaneous Halloween announcements at the White House and the
Kremlin.
   ``We've known what we were doing,'' Bush said. ``We've been on
this track for some time. I've elected to remain very quiet in the
face of a good deal of sentiment that we were missing an
opportunity and that hasn't perturbed me...
   ``Some have suggested that I am _ they use a different word for
it, but a little too much on the cautious side. I think there is
reason to be cautious, and I've said that over and over again.
Substitute the word `prudent' if you want.''
   Bush said he hadn't needed a lot of advice, even from inside his
own administration, in planning the meeting. ``I knew exactly what
I wanted to do and I knew how I wanted to go about doing it,'' he
said.
   Twice.

   Hassan Humayed and his 10 children were
sleeping on his rooftop one hot night when a Katyusha rocket hissed
over and ricocheted off the concrete roof through a stone wall
without exploding.
   ``The people who launch the rockets don't hurt the enemy,''
Humayed fumed. ``They hurt us.''
   The people who fired the rocket were Palestinian guerrillas in a
mountain above town. It was aimed at Israel, 1{ miles west of
Humayed's house on the northern end of the border. A second missile
exploded harmlessly in an Israeli field.
   A few days later, Humayed said, Israeli troops fired a flare
onto the Jordanian side of the Yarmouk River, apparently to burn
brush guerrillas could use for cover. But instead the resulting
fire burned 60 of his family's orange trees.
   The missiles and several recent guerrilla attacks on Israel have
interrupted years of relative calm along Jordan's 300-mile border,
prompting veiled Israeli threats of retaliation if they continue.
   The Palestinian attacks pose a security problem for Israel. But
for Jordanians the issue has wider, strategic implications _
survival against a more powerful foe.
   A senior military official, who cannot be identified because of
Jordanian army regulations, said the Jordanians are doing their
best to stop the Palestinian attacks.
   Twelve members of the Syrian-based Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine were arrested after the rocket attack.
   Military officials said the guerrillas who fired the Katyushas
crossed from Syria, which takes a militant stand against Israel and
sponsors hardline guerrilla factions.
   At the same time, the guerrillas are hostile to efforts by
Jordan and Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation
Organization to reach a diplomatic settlement with Israel.
   ``We don't believe this sort of action will solve the
Palestinian problem,'' the Jordanian military official said. ``If
the Israelis retaliate, it might hurt our citizens.''
   He suggested Syrian-backed radical Palestinians were trying to
undermine Arafat's peace initiative.
   Jordanians are alarmed by right-wing Israeli calls to establish
a Palestinian state in Jordan or for Israel to take control of
Jordanian territory under what they consider to be biblical
precedent.
   ``We take every word said by the Israeli leaders seriously ...
because we've learned they mean it,'' the senior officer said.
   Aqaba, Jordan's only port, along with its most important
farmlands, water systems and potash industry are within Israeli
artillery range.
   All of Jordan's urban centers are only a few minutes' flying
time from Israeli air bases.
   Israeli jets regularly fly into Jordanian airspace, diplomats
said. But the military official noted: ``Nobody has reported to me
that the Israelis are trying to be aggressive against Jordanian
soldiers.''
   Jordanian and Israeli policemen still meet on the King
Hussein-Allenby Bridge on the Jordan River to coordinate the flow
of tour buses that cross under the scrutiny of machinegunners in
blockhouses.
   Along much of the border, Israeli and Jordanian outposts are
only a few hundred yards apart.
   Soldiers at a northern post overlooking the Golan Heights
village of Hammah can hear laughter and music from an Israeli
amusement park nearby.
   But the thunder of artillery from Israeli gunnery ranges, the
supersonic booms of Israeli warplanes and occasional explosions in
border minefields, sometimes triggered by wild pigs, bear witness
that this is still a war zone.

   Farmers growing cotton,
avocados and dates in this commune carry rifles and two-way radios
when they go down to the Jordan River to tend their crops.
   After 20 years of calm alng the 300-mile Israeli-Jordanian
border, recent attacks from inside Jordan have raised tensions.
   ``We're not retreating or panicking,'' said Zvi Zexer, 65, a
high school teacher on the commune of 650 people 75 miles north of
Jerusalem. ``The events of today are nothing compared to the past.''
   Eight members of the kibbutz, one of 73 such communal
settlements along the frontier, were killed by shells, mines and
cross-border raids by Palestinian guerrillas in the 1967-70 war of
attrition.
   According to army figures, 165 soldiers and 32 civilians died in
5,270 terrorist incidents in that period.
   In the latest attacks, the heaviest since the 1960s, three
Israeli soldiers have been killed, a half-dozen wounded and one
kidnapped and held briefly in seven cross-border attacks this year,
the Israelis say. In one incident, rockets were fired into Israel.
   Sgt. Maj. Tomer, patrolling the dusty border in a jeep armed
with a machine gun, recalled that in one attack two Israeli
soldiers were wounded near this kibbutz Sept. 16, by someone who
appeared to them to be a Jordanian soldier, although Jordan says
its soldiers are not involved in attacks on Israel.
   ``It was daylight, about 6 a.m., on the sabbath,'' Tomer said.
``He was hiding in the date palms. He jumped up and fired _ 15
rounds, semi-automatic.'' The attacker got away.
   Israeli officials see the attacks as a sign that the
22-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and the Gaza Strip is spilling over into Jordan.
   Many of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories
have relatives in Jordan.
   Col. Gidi, commander of a unit stationed along the border, said
the Palestine Liberation Organization appeared to be behind some of
the attacks.
   Several attacks have been claimed by radical Syrian-based
Palestinian factions; the PLO says it now wants a peaceful
settlement with Israel.
   ``There are many Palestinians in the Jordanian army,'' Gidi
said. ``They have connections with Palestinians here. Maybe they're
trying to show their families they want to help and identify with
the uprising.''
   Some Israelis view the attacks as a sign that Jordan's
74,000-man army, which has prevented most such attacks in the past,
has become less disciplined in the wake of April's anti-government
riots in Jordan.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy spokesman for the Israeli army, noted
that if the guerrillas feel ``there's some laxity in the discipline
in the Jordanian army, or some weakening in Jordanian resolve, of
course they'll try to infiltrate from this area.''

   Even as the Communist Party celebrates 40 years
in power, a day of reckoning between it and China's 1.1 billion
people seems inevitable. Across the vast country, the political
tensions that produced the student-led pro-democracy movement last
spring are still simmering despite the government's brutal
crackdown and propaganda campaign. Tiananmen Square will not soon
be forgotten.

   The anonymous poster that went up at
Lanzhou University in the first month of classes was defiant. The
spring student-led democracy movement, it said, was not over.
   Across China in Canton, a college student was caught stuffing
leaflets in mailboxes and bicycle baskets, pledging a ``struggle to
the end.''
   Pamphlets written by extreme leftists, criticizing senior leader
Deng Xiaoping as a capitalist, and by reformists, calling him
senile, have appeared mysteriously in the mail of Chinese and
foreigners in several cities.
   Students in southwestern Sichuan province were stopped by
soldiers from marching to Deng's home village and desecrating his
ancestors' graves. Soldiers remain camped there to protect the
graves.
   In the northwestern city of Xian, local residents have taken to
spitting when they see a woman who turned in her younger brother, a
student activist on the government's most-wanted list. Sources said
she has received anonymous threats.
   Taken individually, small events. But together, they signal that
the political tensions that produced the huge student-led marches
of April and May and climaxed in June's bloody crackdown have not
spent themselves.
   Even as the Communist Party celebrates 40 years in power, a
moment of eventual reckoning between it and China's 1.1 billion
people seems inevitable.
   ``People are waiting for Deng to die, just as they waited for
the emperors to die,'' said a Western scholar, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Although the 85-year-old leader has
appeared several times in public lately, he is believed to suffer
from cancer.
   ``When Deng dies, we'll celebrate,'' said a college senior in
Zhengzhou.

   The Chinese have a saying: ``Three men can create a tiger.''
   ``One man can say he saw a tiger, and no one will believe him.
But if three men say they saw it, people will believe,'' explained
Wei Yang, a college student in this arid capital of Gansu province,
two day's journey by train from Beijing.
   Wei, like others, spoke on condition he be given a pseudonym.
   He worries that with time and repetition, people will begin to
believe the government's version of a tiger _ its charge that
counter-revolutionaries were behind the popular student-led
democracy movement and that they and hoodlums caused more damage
with rocks and bottles than soldiers did with tanks and guns.
   In Beijing, the center of the storm, where more than one out of
every 10 residents joined in the movement in some form, few people
believe in the tiger despite months of intense education by the
government.
   To them, the students remain heroes who dared to say what no one
else did: that the people's democratic dictatorship was only a
dictatorship.
   Generally, Beijing residents no more represent China than New
Yorkers speak for all Americans. But two weeks of travel through
provincial capitals found the same cynicism and anger in
conversations with dozens of students, teachers and urban workers.
   Only in the villages, about the only places where students and
sympathizers did not march for reform, do ordinary people say with
apparent sincerity that the government was right to set the army on
protesters in Beijing. But they are ignorant of many details, even
the government's admission that hundreds died.
   Asked how the army ended the protests, Zhou Zhenchuan, a factory
manager in Peaceful Village near Lanzhou, replied, ``They used tear
gas.'' Told that soldiers also fired guns, he said in disbelief,
``I never heard that.''
   If ignorance has ensured peace in the countryside, fear serves
the same purpose in the cities.
   Although the government stopped announcing arrests of suspected
dissidents in July, after more than 2,000 were publicized, Chinese
and Western sources in Lanzhou and three other provincial capitals
_ Zhengzhou, Xian and Chengdu _ said a new wave of interrogations
and arrests began in September, when colleges reopened. No reliable
figures were available.
   Special investigation teams have been formed on each campus.
   ``They're going through the libraries on campus and taking books
off the shelves and locking them up,'' said a foreign teacher who
insisted on not being identified, even by the city where she lives.
   Old files are being reopened, she said, and past writings and
comments are being examined for signs of capitalist or Western
sympathies as authorities seek not only to round up those connected
with the protests but to stamp out liberal thought.
   Police patrols of campuses have been increased. At one school,
police stop at night at the room of a former student leader to ask,
``Are you there?''
   Some professors who sympathized with or advised the students
have been banned from teaching and remain in limbo in their campus
housing, not daring to meet with friends for fear of harming them
by association.
   Wei said that after the lone ``big character poster'' went up at
Lanzhou University, signed ``the China Democratic League _ Lanzhou
Branch,'' officials brought in handwriting experts to examine it.
Within days, seven students were arrested.
   ``We don't know if our dorms are bugged,'' he said. ``One night
a group of students debated among themselves. One group argued for
putting down the turmoil, another opposed it. The next day, a
teacher said, `You students should talk less about it.'
   ``How did he know?''

   Lanzhou clings to the banks of the Yellow River 840 miles west
of Beijing. For centuries it was the westernmost outpost of Chinese
civilization before plunging into the thinly charted wilds of
Mongolia and Xinjiang.
   News from Beijing often arrives days late. By the time the
impact of a government policy trickles down, a new policy often has
taken its place, a government worker said.
   But when Beijing students began a hunger strike in May to press
their cause, more than 10,000 Lanzhou students and older
intellectuals marched to show support.

   When the army attacked the Beijing students on June 3-4, Lanzhou
students flocked to the railway station and tore up the tracks to
keep local soldiers from being sent to the capital. They blocked
city roads and bridges, too, shutting down the city for nearly a
week in hopes that the chaos would topple Premier Li Peng and
others who ordered the army attack.
   Gansu Gov. Jia Zhijie mobilized thousands of police to remove
the blockades and round up protesters. ``When a rat runs across the
street, everybody cries, `Kill it,''' he said grimly.
   Lanzhou is far from the most remote place where people
protested. The government says 80 cities were affected, but the
number seems much larger.
   Domestic radio in May reported marches in a dozen cities and
towns in the southwestern province of Sichuan alone, including some
places so small they could not be found in an atlas. A recent
traveler to a dozen semi-rural county towns was told in each that
protests were held there in the spring.
   During the height of the movement, hundreds of thousands of
students traveled between Beijing and other cities, sharing
information and funds. Although their illegal unions have been
disbanded, ties of sympathy remain.
   Asked if he believed the protests were counter-revolutionary,
one student in Xian declared: ``We have brains, we also are
students. Students all over the country are in unison.''
   Several months into the new school year, this unison seems
unlikely to translate into action anytime soon.
   Under the most intense and wide-reaching government attack in
years on dissent and anything else that offends the leaders, most
people _ students included _ have subsided into silent
introspection.
   There are reports that gambling and drinking are on the increase
among students. At one technical school, students were found
gambling at mah-jongg, an ancient tile game, and were given
demerits, a fellow student said.
   ``The students are depressed. They don't cooperate. They don't
`biaotai' (make the ritual declaration of their political loyalty)
or if they do it's just perfunctory,'' said Wang Shuying, a
provincial government employee, privately confirming what teachers
and students have said.
   ``The political education has no impact. People are trying to
leave. Those who before were willing to wait for their work units
to send them abroad are trying now to pay their own way.''
   Wang, who does not speak a foreign language, has no hope of
leaving. He wavers between bitter envy of the students' arrogance
and a shared hatred for the party.
   ``Wang Dan and the others, their lives were easy,'' she said,
referring to a top Beijing student leader now under arrest.
``That's why they dared speak _they had no political experience.''
   She has spent most of her more than 30 years under the inherited
stigma of her parents' 1957 label as ``rightists.''
   ``Speaking out does no good,'' she said, anger in her voice.
``You can't change anything. You can only make it harder for
yourself later on. The arm cannot be stronger than the leg.'' The
leg in China is the Communist Party.
   ``Chinese intellectuals are weak,'' she adds. ``Yes, I count
myself among them. There's something lacking in our character. Why
have all modern Chinese leaders been peasants? Look at Mao
Tse-tung, Deng Xiaoping.''
   Wei shares some of Wang's doubts.
   ``We talked about democracy, but no one really knew what it
is,'' he said. ``I only know what it is not. How does it work? We
need to find out more about it.''
   When, like thousands of students, he traveled to Beijing in May
to join the sit-in in Tiananmen Square, he found the movement
presided over by a few students who were inaccessible behind
cordons of pickets, just like party leaders.
   ``Some people say that in 30 years when this generation comes to
power, we will overthrow the system,'' he said. ``But others say we
will only change the name of the party from Communist and nothing
will really change, just like the Communists replaced the emperors
but became new emperors.
   ``Deng Xiaoping was suppressed once, and now he suppresses
others. Some say Wu'er Kaixi (a student leader who fled to the
United States) will be the next Deng Xiaoping.''
   In the end, Wang said, it may not matter whether the
intellectuals choose socialism or capitalism, democracy or
authoritarianism. Rising unemployment and the gap in living
standards between cities and villages may trigger mass anger that
will put China's future, once again, in the hands of peasants
motivated not by democracy but by their pocketbooks.
   Chengdu's experience may be telling. Many of those who clashed
with police there in early June, setting buses on fire and throwing
bricks and stones, were peasants come from the countryside to look
for work. Both of the two men executed in Chengdu were peasants _
one was 61, the other was 19.

   The penalty was heavy, but some still look back with nostalgia
on the heady days of spring.
   ``Students from the Communications University went around
collecting money to give the students in Beijing,'' a Xian factory
worker recalled, waiting wearily at midnight for a late train.
``People didn't think, I have 10 bucks, I'll give the students 5.
They gave whatever money they had.''
   As in Beijing, most of the scars of Xian's protests have been
scrubbed or painted over. A young office worker stood in the rain
in Xincheng Square, where Xian students held a month-long sit-in in
the spring, and looked about as if searching for the vanished
banners and tents.
   ``It looked just like Tiananmen Square,'' he said. ``They had a
broadcast station over here and another at the bell tower. The
students closed off the street, but I got in and took some
photographs.''
   He keeps the negatives hidden, unprinted, waiting for a more
tolerant time.
   Wei, too, has hidden photographs and memories.
   ``Everyone thinks Beijing people are great. I had no place to
stay and a man offered to take me in. My friend was walking down
the street in Beijing and a man stopped him and said, `Are you a
student?' The man took him to a restaurant and gave him a big
dinner.
   ``I am proud I went. I don't know what will happen in the
future, but it was history and I saw it.''

   Years later, Albert Einstein would say it was
``the great mistake of my life.'' Fifty years ago, Einstein signed
a letter urging President Franklin D. Roosevelt to get the United
States government involved in nuclear research. But there was good
reason. Nazi Germany already had begun its hunt for the atomic
bomb. The second of two articles.

   In 1939, much of the U.S. Army, such as it was, trained with
make-believe cannon made of two-by-fours, trucks labeled ``Tank,''
rifles that were actually broomsticks.
   On Jan. 4 of that year President Franklin D. Roosevelt
astonished Congress by asking to increase the military budget by an
unheard of $2 billion. War loomed in Europe. A new Oldsmobile cost
$777. Who of the survivors of the Great Depression could afford
one, much less tanks and bombers?
   Into this nail-biting world on Jan. 16, 1939, sailed the
Swedish-American liner Drottingholm. On board this unheralded
arrival in New York was Danish physicist Niels Bohr. He bore
momentous news _ to the esoteric world of physics. The atom had
been split. In Nazi Germany.
   By nightfall the word reached the weekly meeting of the
Princeton University physics faculty. It became galvanized ``like a
stirred-up ant heap.''
   Eugene Wigner hadn't been there. He was in the university
infirmary with jaundice. But he had heard. He told his friend Leo
Szilard who was making a bedside visit. That was like telling the
town gossip your juiciest tidbit.
   Szilard and Wigner were Jewish physicists. Along with their
Hungarian countryman, Edward Teller, they had decided to put an
ocean between themselves and Adolf Hitler. In time they would
become known as ``the Hungarian conspiracy'' for their
lapel-tugging insistence that their new homeland heed the atom.
   Szilard, a stubby fountain of overflowing ideas, had once tried
to patent atomic energy after reading a futuristic novel by H.G.
Wells prophesying nuclear war. At the Princeton infirmary ``all the
things which H.G. Wells predicted appeared suddenly real to me,''
Szilard remembered.
   He rushed back to Columbia University and asked Dr. Isidor Rabi
to query the quiet, methodical Italian Enrico Fermi, recent winner
of a Nobel Prize, whether a split uranium atom could produce a
chain reaction, key to a bomb.
   ``Nuts,'' Fermi replied. There was only a ``remote
possibility,'' perhaps 10 percent.
   ``Ten percent is not a remote possibility if it means we may die
of it,'' said Rabi.
   The news spread rapidly far beyond the Princeton-New York axis.
In Paris, Pierre Curie confirmed the German experiment. French
scientists took out a patent on atomic energy, including one for a
bomb. The Dutch bought 50 tons of uranium from the Belgian Congo,
the world's richest source. ``Clever, these physicists,'' said the
Dutch finance minister. The German army ordnance department began
investigating ``the uranium problem.''
   On March 16, Fermi and George Pegram, a physicist and dean of
graduate faculties at Columbia, visited the Navy Department in
Washington. They explained how uranium could possibly ``liberate a
million times as much energy per pound as any known explosive.''
The Navy, interested in the phenomenon for submarine propulsion,
asked them to stay in touch. It advanced them $2,000 _ not quite
three Oldsmobiles _ for further research.
   William Arnold, an American biologist, was studying under Bohr
in Copenhagen where the splitting of a uranium atom by Germans Otto
Hahn and Fritz Strassmani in December had been duplicated two weeks
later. He recalled the name for division of bacteria. Binary
fission. He named atom-splitting nuclear fission.
   By whatever name, the Hungarian conspiracy and Szilard in
particular were chilled at the thought of Nazism unlocking the atom
first. Fission was no longer just a scientific Holy Grail. Mankind
could be at stake. The U.S. government must do something. But the
immodest Szilard had the modesty to appreciate that an unknown
Hungarian lacked the megatonnage to press urgency on Washington.
Who did?
   Albert Einstein.
   The German emigre with the hurricane-blown hairstyle was
probably the world's best-known scientist. And Szilard knew he was
an acquaintance of Queen Elizabeth of Belgium and its Congo
uranium. Szilard phoned Princeton where Einstein was with the
Institute for Advanced Study. Einstein was summering at a Dr.
Moore's cottage in Peconic, Long Island. On July 16 Szilard, who
didn't drive, set off with Wigner, who did, to find the reclusive
Einstein.
   ``We asked a number of people, but no one knew where Dr. Moore's
cabin was,'' Szilard recalled. ``We were on the point of giving up
when I saw a boy of about 7 or 8 years of age standing on the curb.
I leaned out the window and asked: `Say, do you by any chance know
where professor Einstein lives?' The boy knew and offered to take
us there.''
   An atomic bomb? ``I never thought of that,'' said Einstein who
had just come in from sailing and was clad only in shorts in the
heat. ``I did not, in fact, foresee that (atomic energy) would be
released in my lifetime. I only believed that it was theoretically
possible.'' The deviser of the core formula of the atomic bomb, the
fateful e equals mc2, had had his mind on other cosmic matters.
   Einstein preferred contacting a Belgian Cabinet member he knew
rather than the queen. As a courtesy, Szilard said, they should
mark in the State Department. If State didn't respond in two weeks,
Einstein would send his letter to Belgium. Over sandwiches
sporadically produced by the household, the scientists agreed they
probably knew more about atoms than statecraft.
   Szilard said he would ``consult with friends more experienced in
practical things'' back in New York. On July 19 he contacted one
such, Dr. Gustav Stolper, a refugee and former member of the German
Reichstag. Stolper advised Szilard to meet with Dr. Alexander
Sachs, a financier, biologist and economist who had worked for
three years in Roosevelt's New Deal and was a friend.
   Sachs was 46, Russian-born, American-educated in a variety of
areas, a bystander fascinated with current atomic research, a dead
ringer for comedian Ed Wynn and a man who prided himself on a
talent for ``prehistory,'' being in on the birth pangs of things in
their infancy. ``The best thing to do,'' he counseled Szilard, was
contact his friend FDR. If Szilard preferred someone other than
himself as a middleman, Sachs suggested Karl Compton, president of
MIT; Bernard Baruch, the financier; or Charles Lindbergh, the hero
pilot and vocal anti-war isolationist.
   Szilard drove back to Peconic to discuss a draft letter to
Roosevelt. This time Teller drove. ``I entered history as Szilard's
chauffeur,'' said the man who would become known as the father of
the H-bomb. The A-bomb was to have no designated father. Szilard
was certainly the matchmaker.

   In early August, Einstein sent back to Szilard the signed two
versions of the letter Szilard had drafted, one short, one long.
   ``I wondered how many words we could expect the president to
read,'' the matchmaker recalled. ``How many words did the fission
of uranium rate?''
   Einstein warned the impetuous Szilard against being ``too
clever.'' Szilard replied: ``We're surely not trying to be too
clever and will be quite satisfied if only we don't look stupid.''
   Einstein was to say that the letter was ``the great mistake of
my life. But there was some justification _ the danger that the
Germans would make (bombs).'' Einstein was aware that C.F.
Weizsacker, son of the German undersecretary of state, was working
at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute where Hahn Strassmann had split
their atom. He did not know that the month after signing the
letters Hitler's War Office officially took over the KWI and began
its hunt for an atomic bomb.
   ``The show was going before that letter was even written,'' said
Dr. Vannevar Bush, the U.S. wartime science leader.
   On Aug. 14, Szilard wrote Lindbergh enclosing Einstein's letter
and suggesting he contact Roosevelt. That now famous letter was
pure Szilard in its assurance that the impossible was possible:
   ``Now it appears almost certain that (vast amounts of energy)
could be achieved in the immediate future ...'' Restraint elsewhere
sounds more like Einstein: ``This new phenomenon (a chain reaction)
would also lead to the construction of bombs and it is conceivable
_ though much less certain _ that extremely powerful bombs of a new
type may thus be constructed.''
   Lindy never answered Einstein's ``Dear Herr Lindbergh'' letter.
On Sept. 27, less than a month after Germany began World War II by
invading Poland, Szilard wrote Einstein, ``Lindbergh is not our
man.''
   Sachs seemed no better. On Oct. 3 Szilard wrote Einstein that
Sachs was ``still sitting on the letter ... (and possibly) Sachs
was useless.''
   Not so. Sachs understood atoms. And he understood Washington.
``Our system is such that national public figures ... are,
so-to-speak, punch-drunk with printer's ink ... There was no point
in transmitting material which would be passed on to someone lower
down. I could only do it if I could see (Roosevelt) for a long
stretch of time and read the material so it came in by way of the
ear and not as soft mascara on the eye.''
   On Oct. 11, 1939, Sachs finally got his appointment.
   ``Alex, what are you up to?'' the president askeds. Sachs had
discussed nuclear energy with Roosevelt earlier in the year.
Nothing came of it. The Navy had relayed its doubts to the White
House based on Pegram's and Fermi's uncertainty that a chain
reaction was possible.
   This time Sachs played the president in accord with the old
recipe for boar's head soup: ``First, catch your boar ...''
   He opened with a parable from history, a lure to catch a
classicist president. Napoleon had once scoffed at an offer from
Robert Fulton to use steamboats to invade Britain. Moral: Leaders
reject technology at their own peril.
   Determining that ``no scientist could sell (atomic energy) to
him,'' Sachs instead paraphrased Einstein's letter in his own 800
words. He concluded by quoting a lecture in 1938 by British
scientist Francis Aston comparing the cave man's probable rejection
of fire as dangerous to his descendant's reaction to nuclear energy
for the same reason:
   ``Personally,'' Aston had said, ``I think there is no doubt .. .
that one day man will release and control (the atom's) almost
infinite power. We cannot prevent him from doing so and can only
hope that he will not use it exclusively in blowing up his
next-door neighbor.''
   ``Alex,'' said Roosevelt, ``what you are after is to see that
the Nazis don't blow us up.''
   ``Precisely.''
   Roosevelt turned to his secretary, Brig. Gen. Edwin M. ``Pa''
Watson. ``Pa, this requires action.'' Then Sachs and FDR had a
snifter of brandy. Napoleon brandy.
   While the National Academy of Sciences had existed since 1863,
relations between government and science had never been easy, even
in wartime. Government was a collective enterprise. Science was the
lonely figure in a lab with a few assistants. After Oct. 11, 1939,
however, science and government became inextricably wedded _
particularly by the shotgun wedding exigencies of World War II.
   Following his meeting with Sachs, Roosevelt directed Dr. Lyman
J. Briggs, head of the National Bureau of Standards, to form a
committee to investigate the potential of fission. Szilard, Teller
and Wigner were at the first meeting in Washington on Oct. 21. Lt.
Col. Keith F. Adamson, an army ordnance expert, said it took two
years to develop new weapons. Morale, not weapons, won wars, he
said.
   The Army had a standing prize for anyone who could kill with a
death ray a goat tethered at the Army's proving ground in Aberdeen,
Md., he added. ``Nobody has claimed the prize yet.''
   Wigner, the most tactful of the Hugarian conspiracy, interjected
that this was very interesting. If morale, not weapons, won wars,
``perhaps one should take a second look at the budget of the Army,
and maybe the budget should be cut.''
   ``All right, all right, you'll get the money,'' Adamson shot
back.
   It was only $6,000 and slow in coming. At Columbia, Fermi began
using the money to start building a pile of sooty, slippery
graphite blocks, hopefully the first reactor. He enlisted the
muscle of the Columbia football team for heavy lifting.
   Off in the future were Pearl Harbor, Fermi's historic chain
reaction in Chicago in December 1942, the Manhattan Project that
culminated man's long curiosity about atoms. And Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, which raised questions beyond science's abililty to
answer in a lab as to where the quest into the invisible world of
matter had led.
   Fermi, as he had so often in this long pursuit of the atom's
secret, foreshadowed what was to come while the doings of Szilard
and Einstein and Sachs in the year 1939 were still only question
marks. And little ones at that. Not long after Einstein's letter
had been delivered, the Italian scientist was standing high up in
Columbia's Pupin Hall contemplating Manhattan's skyline.
   ``A little bomb like that, and it would all disappear,'' he said
to himself.

   Had any good pig snouts lately? For food writers
Jane and Michael Stern, life is a never-ending search along the
front lines of American gastronomy. Their reports from the diners,
clam shacks and barbecue pits of the nation celebrate regional fare
and capture the flavor of a vanishing America.

<TEXT>
   To get on Jane and Michael Stern's
wavelength, think macaroni and cheese instead of squid ink pasta,
Jell-O, not aspic, and s'mores instead of sorbets. Forget haute
cuisine. Think home cookin'.
   Imagine crisscrossing the country, from clam shack to catfish
parlor to barbecue pit. Picture a never-ending search for the
perfect pig snout sandwich (C&amp;K BBQ, St. Louis) or the ideal sugar
cream pie (Groves Restaurant, Bloomington, Ind.).
   The Sterns do this for a living, filing dispatches from places
like Mary Bobo's Boardinghouse (Lynchburg, Tenn.) and Maurice's
Piggy Park (West Columbia, S.C.).
   The view from the front lines of American gastronomy is pretty
much unobstructed. ``I can't think of a single food writer who
travels, except to places like San Francisco or New York, or on
junkets with other food writers to other major cities,'' says Jane.
   ``Nobody else just gets in their car and goes to these stinkpot
little towns and asks, `What's for dinner?'''
   It could be tripe soup in Philadelphia, country ham and red-eye
gravy in Nashville, Rocky Mountain oysters in Denver, cioppino in
Eureka, Calif.
   And save room for dessert: Indian pudding in New England, banana
pudding in Virginia, bread pudding in Louisiana, persimmon pudding
in Illinois. The ``pie pan of beans'' at Lambert's in Sikeston,
Mo., comes with dessert _ a King Edward cigar and a stick of Big
Red chewing gum.
   Unlike most food critics, anonymous eaters who slip in and out
of restaurants incognito, the Sterns aren't at all shy. There they
are, about to dig into breakfast, on their latest book, ``A Taste
of America,'' a compilation of their weekly column published in 200
newspapers.
   ``In most of the restaurants we go to, when people see us taking
notes, they just assume we're from the health department,'' Jane
says.
   Besides which, there's little danger of being recognized at,
say, Ruth &amp; Jimmie's Sporting Goods and Cafe in Abbeville, Miss.,
where diners can stock up on live bait before chowing down on fried
okra.
   Likewise in the green cinder-block house in Sevierville, Tenn.,
where customers pay $5 to troop into Gladys Breeden's kitchen, grab
plates from her cupboard and pile them high with whatever she felt
like cooking that day.
   Make no mistake, though, Jane says. ``We wouldn't hang out in
any old greasy spoon. The central charm of a place like Gladys' is
that the food is really good.''
   Let other critics fill up on salsa, seviche and chocolate mousse
cake. Michael Stern prefers ``a really great tuna casserole,'' the
kind with crumbled potato chips on top. Jane is partial to that old
blue-plate special: the hot turkey sandwich a la Wonder Bread.
   Should crushed potato chips seem a trifle passe in this era of
sun-dried tomatoes and balsamic vinegar, that doesn't bother the
Sterns. ``We're very obstinate people,'' says Michael. ``We like
going against the grain.''
   Consider ``Square Meals,'' their 1984 cookbook. At the height of
nouvelle cuisine, it celebrated ``The Miracle of Dry Onion Soup,''
``Casseroles _ Glamour With a Can Opener,'' and ``Jell-O, the
Chef's Magic Powder.''
   ``We got annoyed reading articles claiming that the day of the
meatloaf had passed,'' Jane says. ``We realized that food was
getting ridiculous. Food writers were so out of touch.''
   Not to mention that nouvelle got on her nerves. ``Those tiny
little portions, the rare fish, the baby vegetables. The
preciousness of it all.''
   Ironically, ``Square Meals,'' an affectionate look at America's
culinary past, proved to be ahead of its time. It ushered in the
``comfort food'' era, just as ``Roadfood,'' their 1978 guide to
roadside cuisine, presaged a new interest in regional American
cuisine.
   Not just food, but ``food in its cultural context'' is what
interests the Sterns, whose accounts whet appetites for the flavor
of a disappearing America.
   They're stories about people and places, department store lunch
rooms and Southern boardinghouses, of outmoded ways of fixing
outdated dishes, of the joy of finding blue-ribbon pies lurking
behind the rusted-shut door to a combination gas station-restaurant
that appears to be closed but isn't.
   Places like the Tick-Tock Room or This Is It Cafe ``really give
you a real taste of the region, of the people, of the heritage, of
the place,'' Jane says. ``If you ate at Lutece or Le Cirque, you'd
get a taste of France in New York City.
   ``That may be interesting to many other writers, but it doesn't
have the cultural evocativeness and richness that the Gladys
Breedens of the world have.''
   Evocative is the word. In ``A Taste of America,'' a Seattle
cinnamon roll is ``a vast spiral of pastry with clods of raisins
and veins of dark sugar gunk packed into its warm furrows''; the
crust of a New Haven white clam pizza is ``a sumptuous mottled ring
of pliant bready pillowettes.''
   ``The problem with being a food writer is, it's an oxymoron,''
says Jane. ``Food is so interesting, the writing gets eclipsed.
People love our books because we can tell them where to go for a
good, inexpensive meal. But we're also good writers.''
   The Sterns also cover non-food topics for The New Yorker, and
their literary credits include such varied works as ``Elvis
World,'' a 1987 New York Times best seller; ``Trucker: A Portrait
of the Last American Cowboy''; and ``Amazing America,'' a guide to
such little-known tourist attractions as The World's Largest (Or
Second Largest) Ball of Twine.
   ``The common thread that runs through our work is that we write
about things other critics and writers ignore,'' Jane says. ``We
don't write about what life should be, we write about what is.
   ``We're two East Coast, Ivy League, upper-middle-class
intellectuals in love with the wrong side of culture,'' she says,
her pensive expression giving way to a devilish grin. ``It gives
priggish people the shivers.''

   Jane, the only child of a former concert pianist and a Hungarian
leather salesman, grew up in Manhattan where ``I didn't see one
shred of normal family life.'' When she was 10, her parents hired a
housekeeper from Alabama, ``one of the great Southern cooks. She'd
make things like Coca-Cola-basted ham and I thought this was great
New York Jewish food. It wasn't until I moved away that I realized
I'd been wrong.''
   Michael cut his teeth on elaborate Jell-O creations from his
mother's kitchen in an affluent Chicago suburb, which accounts for
his love affair with The Chef's Magic Powder. His good grades were
marred by what passed for a rebellious streak in 1950s Winnetka: He
was thrown off the crossing guard squad for beaning a kid with an
eclair. Later, as a teen-ager he joined a gang of marauding
suburban youth. ``We raised heck.''
   They met at that mecca of radicalism and counterculture, Yale.
   Jane still buries her face in a pillow when Michael gleefully
describes her opening line 21 years ago: ``Are you a Scorpio?''
   Their courtship consisted largely of movies _ so many that
Michael dropped out of graduate school to fit them all in. He later
got a master's in film at Columbia University. Jane's, in fine
arts, is from Yale.
   When the time came to launch their careers, ``I couldn't figure
out how to do galleries, and Michael couldn't figure out how to go
to Hollywood and make movies.'' They opted to stay in Connecticut
and play volleyball.
   While Michael taught at a community college, Jane drove back and
forth from their rented house in Guilford to New Haven to read the
bulletin board at Yale's job placement office. En route, she
stopped for coffee at a truck stop, where ``I got more and more
intrigued by the truckers, to the point where I'd take Michael with
me.''
   For most people, the turning point in life is a meaningful job
offer, a relationship with an influential mentor, or a decision to
pursue a long-held dream. For the Sterns, it was a routine browse
in the 39-cent record bin at Mammoth Mart, where they came upon Red
Simpson's album, ``Hello, I'm a Truck.''
   ``We realized there was a whole subculture, the last cowboys,''
says Jane. ``But we still didn't know what to do about it.''
   Eventually, a friend suggested they write a book. Eureka! With a
$2,500 advance from McGraw-Hill, the Sterns headed off on the trail
of the trucker. Their photo essay book came out three years later.
As luck would have it, ``Trucker'' ushered in the CB radio craze.
   They moved right on to ``Roadfood,'' book No. 2.
   ``We'd always been eaters,'' says Michael. ``While researching
the trucker book, we found all this regional American food. We
realized it was all word- of-mouth, that there was no catalog or
listing of great road food places.''
   They set off in June 1976 with a game plan nothing short of
brilliant: Eat in every diner in America, then write about the good
ones.
   Eight months later, they got to New Jersey.
   Time for a new plan.
   They began honing their road food radar, the ability to separate
the memorable from the mundane. ``We began looking for sheriff's
cars, or pictures of pigs or cows on roofs. That shows
personality,'' Michael says.
   ``We said no to big mondo plastic places with mansard roofs, to
corporate chains with huge laminated menus. What intrigued us were
places that gave evidence of one person's genius, old places, wacky
places, places with hand-written menus or big round tables where
everyone knew each other.''
   They scanned Yellow Pages, eschewing big ads for tiny ones. They
studied billboards, shunning any place that said, ``Bus Tours
Welcome.'' They learned to taste rather than gorge, so they could
check out 10 restaurants in a day.
   The more they traveled, the more they took note of regional
specialties: the sour cream raisin pie of East Iowa, ``a dairyland
dense pack topped with swirling meringue''; the Indian pudding of
New England, ``a dark duff with centuries of character in every
rough-grained spoonful''; the red beans and rice of New Orleans,
``each bean a small pillow of creamy silk ....''
   Such local dishes have become the Sterns' bread-and-butter,
prompting Country Journal to dub them ``the heroes of real American
food.'' The late James Beard called ``Goodfood'' a book ``of the
people and for the people.''
   After 14 books and countless articles, all written jointly and
with a compatibility rare among collaborators, ``it's hard to tell
who did what anymore,'' Jane says. ``We both take credit for the
good parts.''
   Their biggest difference may be their taste in food. ``We rarely
eat the same thing for dinner,'' Jane says. Lately, all her dinners
have consisted of the same low-cal dish: turkey burgers on pita
bread, penance for past research. Michael, an exercise addict,
diets constantly.
   After 15 years on the road, they still love to travel, though
their trips tend to be shorter, their tolerance for cheap motels
lower. They're also more selective about where and what they will
eat.
   They concede that the climate surrounding American cuisine is
becoming more hospitable, but still, ``Nobody is writing about
pretzel salad,'' Michael says. ``It's amazing how much attention
and care is paid to subtleties in regions of Italy and China, but
not here.''
   Jane blames the traditional purpose of food writers: ``To help
people climb out of the lower middle class and into the upper
middle class, to help people impress others. The same thing is true
of decorator books; no one says, `Go out and buy a Barcalounger.' ''
   There are no Barcaloungers at the Sterns', no velvet paintings,
pink flamingos or any of the other artifacts chronicled in their
forthcoming epic, ``The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste.'' Given their
passion for cultural oddities, their home seems incongruous, like
finding a cache of Velveeta in Julia Child's cupboard.
   But wait. What have we here?
   Inside that grand mahogany bookcase are ``Mask and Flippers,''
the autobiography of Lloyd Bridges, and ``Come In, Gasman,'' the
history of the American gas industry. The Autobiography and
American Industry sections flank the Constipation Collection (``The
Culture of the Abdomen''), just to the left of Neuroses (``Are Your
Glands on Friendly Terms?'') and Poultry (``The Squab Register'').
   ``Just like a social register,'' Jane says helpfully, ``except
it's for squabs.''

   They're trying to clean up Fort Lauderdale,
``Fort Liquor-dale'' as it's known to many, the springtime trysting
place of hordes of beer-soaked college students, the place where
the wet T-shirt contest may well have been invented. Well, they're
trying. It's like a stripper working in reverse and there are a lot

   Business remains brisk at a topless
check-cashing outlet. There's talk of resuming semi-nude car
washes. And for a $2 cover charge, bare-breasted women will serve
you coffee and doughnuts at a shop near the airport.
   Off the interstate, brothels thinly disguised as ``gentlemen's
retreats'' boast in neon of all-girl staffs and round-the-clock
hours. Male and female prostitutes patrol the palm-dotted beach.
   But the permissive atmosphere has dissipated a bit recently in
this South Florida city, which got a reputation as a freewheeling
party town nearly 30 years ago with Connie Francis' beach-blanket
anthem, ``Where the Boys Are.''
   With Ms. Francis well into middle age and her version of
Lauderdale little more than a memory, reform-minded officials and
outspoken citizens have taken aim at the remaining risque
diversions, saying it's time Fort Lauderdale grew up, too.
   ``It's not a morality issue, it's an image issue,'' said City
Commissioner Sheila Harrigan on Oct. 3 before the five-member board
unanimously passed an ordinance banning liquor from clubs with nude
entertainment.
   The controversial effort to restrict the city's seven adult
nightclubs is but the latest crusade to tame Fort Lauderdale into a
more family-oriented environment and reduce crime.
   One reason is that the winter trek of northern tourists more and
more ends at the wholesome Walt Disney World in Orlando.
   ``It's true that Disney and the other theme parks are
competition, but we're trying to tie into that market,'' says
Francine Mason of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and
Visitors Bureau. ``Disney, after all, doesn't have a beach.''
   The long stretch of sand was the scene of the first skirmishes
between those partying college students and police. Beginning in
the mid-1980s, an intense police crackdown ran out Spring Break, an
annual bacchanal that drew up to 350,000 college students to the
sub-tropical sun of Fort Lauderdale.
   With spring breakers exiled to Daytona Beach, South Padre Island
in Texas and other spots, Fort Lauderdale officials have turned
their attention to the city's seamier side.
   Gone are the adult bookstores and peep shows, pushed across the
city limits. Ordinances have been passed to curb radio noise and
cruising in cars along the beach strip, where police vehicles with
pulsing blue lights are stationed like beacons warning lawbreakers
to steer clear.
   ``You cannot, by legislation, make people morally pure and
holy,'' says the Rev. James Kennedy, pastor of Fort Lauderdale's
Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church. ``But government can control the
baser instincts of man. Rape and murder are immoral so we have laws
against them.''
   ``We're slowly cleansing the city of its not-clean elements,''
says Mayor Robert Cox.
   But critics of the crusade are easy to find.
   Many merchants along the beach strip _ a tawdry collection of
T-shirt shops, hotels and hard-drinking bars _ have vowed to battle
a proposal to raze their property for redevelopment as an upscale
complex of boutiques and cafes, similar to the gentrification of
Miami Beach about 20 miles south.
   The city also has hired consultants and launched an
international public-relations campaign, boasting plans to upgrade
its downtown with projects such as a $52.6 million performing arts
center and a $29 million science complex. Officials are considering
a proposal to add a 64-story skyscraper to its growing skyline.
   Signs are everywhere proclaiming Fort Lauderdale's goal of being
the best city of its size by 1994.
   ``Image. That's all I hear is image,'' says Dante Scola, owner
of the Playmate Lounge, a nude dance club. ``The image I have is of
a city that's trying to change itself by making a lot of rules.''
   ``All of a sudden Lauderdale got religion,'' says Eric Murray,
sitting on a stool at R Donuts, a coffee shop with topless
waitresses. ``This town built itself on being a party place. You
take the fun out of Lauderdale and you're left with nothing.''
   Even tourism experts have been slow to tout the new Fort
Lauderdale.
   ``I wouldn't see Fort Lauderdale as your typical family
destination,'' says Bill Carlson, marketing research director for
Holiday Corp., which owns the Holiday Inn and Embassy Suites hotel
chains. ``When I think of Fort Lauderdale, I think college students
and spring break.''
   ``It seems like the place to go for a good time,'' says Julie
Northcutt, spokeswoman for the Atlanta Convention and Visitors
Bureau. ``All I know is my father always called it `Fort
Liquor-dale.'''
   Television cameras also have put the city's serious crime and
drug problems on display. Earlier this year, the syndicated police
show ``Cops'' followed Broward County sheriff's deputies though the
mean streets rarely seen by tourists.
   In April, city officials withdrew permits for a film documentary
about a young runaway in Fort Lauderdale after reviewing the script.
   Ms. Mason, however, notes that a record 3.5 million vistors came
to Broward County last year, with a substantial increase in the
number of foreign tourists.
   ``They don't have a negative image about Fort Lauderdale because
they have never heard of spring break,'' she says.
   The contentious nude bar issue could be the turning point in the
evolution of Fort Lauderdale.
   Opponents say the ordinance may set the tone for further
restrictions on establishments offering late-night hours or
spectacles such as wet T-shirt contests.
   M.J. Peter Club Management, which operates two Fort Lauderdale
clubs and others from the East Coast to Honolulu, is challenging
the ordinance as a violation of the club's First Amendment rights.
   City officials note the ordinance is fashioned after a Daytona
Beach measure, which was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court.
   ``There's a lot of case law involving this issue and it seems
we're on solid legal ground,'' says Commissioner Doug Danziger, an
insurance agent and Coral Ridge church member who introduced the
anti-nude bar ordinance. He was one of two commissioners to report
receiving threats during the four-month controversy.
   Even if the court challenge fails, the nude bars have threatened
to counterattack with sleaze. Peter told commissioners he has
leases to 18 sites, including one next to Danziger's office, and
would open steamy alcohol-free sex clubs to make up for lost liquor
revenue.
   ``It's a matter of economics,'' Peter said. ``You are creating a
nightmare for Fort Lauderdale ... I will do what I have to to stay
alive.''

   The news from Kansas City, it would seem, is
that all is bliss. Every morning, Lili Bliss wakes up watching her
sister Katherine Bliss on Channel 4, anchoring the news. Then Lili
goes to work at Channel 5 to do the same thing. A hot TV rivalry?
No, say the sisters. ``We pick each other up,'' said one.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the news anchor of one midday Kansas
City television news show wraps up her broadcast, her sister faces
the cameras on a rival station.
   But Lili Bliss, who anchors the noon news on KCTV, says she
doesn't consider her sister a rival _ even though Katherine Bliss
anchors the 11:30 a.m. news show on WDAF-TV.
   ``We want us both to be rated number one,'' she says.
   The Blisses are believed to be the only sisters in the nation
who come within 30 minutes of being head-to-head rivals on local
network affiliates.
   Katherine Bliss, 28, is finishing her first year at Channel 4
and Lili Bliss, 30, has spent six years with Channel 5.
   The sisters say they talk almost every day and share ideas about
their work, but both understand their job is to get the most
interesting guests for their midday interviews.
   Instead of feeling competitive, Lili says, ``It's a wonderful
support to have. If you have a bad show or a bad day, there's
always someone in the business who understands. We pick each other
up.''
   ``It's really nice to be able to call up and say `Boy, you'll
never guess what happened today,''' says Katherine, who is known to
family and friends as Kitty.
   The sisters like working in their hometown together. Outside of
an occasional mistaken identity, they say, there are no drawbacks
to the competition.
   While both women have anchor and interview duties, Lili books
her own guests. Because of her 6:30 a.m. anchor duties, Katherine
works closely with producers to arrange her interviews. Lili wakes
up watching her sister each morning.
   While their lives have taken similar professional paths, their
personal lives are different. Lili and her lawyer husband have a
2-year-old son, Curtis, and another child due in November.
   Lili had co-anchored the noon and 5 p.m. newscasts on KCTV until
March. But she cut her hours to spend more time with her growing
family.
   Katherine is single, and jokes that her social life suffers
because her only free time is in the afternoon.
   ``When the 4 a.m. alarm goes off, I groan,'' Katherine says.
``But then I think, `Well, Jane Pauley has already been up for a
couple of hours.'''
   Dominating 60 minutes of airtime has changed the family's
viewing habits. The sisters say their family watches a lot of
television. Their father takes some ribbing, but he won't leave his
office TV for lunch until both midday shows are over.
   After growing up together, with two older sisters, Lili and
Katherine can size each other up easily.
   ``Lili is very motivated. If one dream doesn't work out, she
always has another,'' Katherine says. ``And she's very much in
control of every situtation. She has a much calmer response to this
business.''
   Lili describes her younger sister as ``very outgoing, very
friendly, very relaxed meeting people, with a great sense of humor.
I'm really proud of Kitty, and what she's done in TV.''
   Lili earned an economics degree from Stanford and completed the
10-week summer program at Stanford's Mass Media Institute. Her
first job was at KOLR-TV in Springfield, Mo. She joined KCTV in
1983.
   Katherine got a communications degree from Tulane, then returned
to Kansas City and worked in advertising. With Lili's
encouragement, in 1983 she also attended the Stanford institute.
   While there, she drove to Reno, Nev., to submit her audition
tape. The first two stations turned her down _ but the news
director at KCRL offered her a $4-an-hour job _ if she'd change her
first name. The station was worried that in Nevada, ``Kitty Bliss''
might sound like the wrong kind of working girl.
   Katherine called Lili for advice. She was emphatic: ``Use your
real name and take the job.''
   After nine months in Reno, Katherine spent two years in Tulsa,
Okla., as reporter and weekend anchor at KTUL, and another two
years as weekend anchor at KTVI in St. Louis before she joined WDAF
a year ago.
   She might have sought work in Kansas City earlier but feared
that no station would be interested, knowing she was Lili Bliss'
sister.
   WDAF news director Joyce Reed says she looked at Katherine as an
individual first. ``She is such an energetic, enthusiastic
journalist,'' she says. ``There was no question that she would fit
well into our organization.''
   The family ties don't bother Reed.
   ``It hasn't made any difference,'' she says. ``Katherine has a
different style. Viewers accept her as an individual.'' Moreover,
Reed says, ratings have doubled since Katherine joined forces with
weatherman Dave Dusik on the morning show.
   Stan Carmack, Lili's Channel 5 co-host, is equally enthusiastic
about his partner of six years.
   ``In a business where what we call `twinkies' are running
rampant, here is a lady who has a professional attitude _ and is a
fine journalist.
   ``We have different ideas about how the show should be put
together, and sometimes the discussions get intense. But 90 percent
of the time we're pretty much in accord about what goes on and how
it should go,'' he says. And he sees no drawback to the filial
competition.
   ``It's a competitive situation, but they are family and they are
very close. We have never encountered any problems with the
situation.''
   And there is no end in sight to the Blissful competition, with
both sisters saying they are where they want to work.
   ``With satellite hookups, I can go anywhere or get an interview
from anywhere,'' Lili said.
   ``I've done my moving,'' agrees Katherine.

   They usually begin confronting the law on their
own behalf. But they often end up taking care of other cases for
fellow prisoners overwhelmed by the legal apparatus. Joyce Dixson
is a dramatic case in point. She's one of the jailhouse lawyers.

   Inmates follow Joyce Dixson everywhere,
to the bathroom, to the dining hall, to her cell.
   Her legal knowledge has her in such demand that she feels there
are too few hours in the day to get everything done _ even as she
serves life in prison without chance of parole. She's paying for
her education dearly.
   An attractive 38-year-old mother of two, she has spent the last
14 years behind bars for shooting her pimp. Her own case seems
hopeless, so she works for her fellow inmates.
   But it was the sense of having been wrongly used that drove her
to study law.
   She has appealed several times, winning three times in the
Michigan Court of Appeals on different issues. But the appeals were
overturned in state and federal courts, and the U.S. Supreme Court,
she says, refused to rule on it.
   As a child in Saginaw, Mich., she would watch her future pass.
   ``I used to sit on my porch when I was a little girl and watch
him go by with a Cadillac full of girls _ that was the exciting,
glamorous life. The heroes of the neighborhood were those people
with money and big cars.
   ``I graduated from high school and I had good jobs. I worked at
GMAC, at the bank, at Kroger's. But as long as I was home in the
neighborhood, whatever I got was never enough. My mother was on
welfare. I got caught up in his sweet talk, `I can show you a
better way.'
   ``I was off and running and I didn't even know where I was
going. It's so easy to be manipulated when you want to believe what
you hear.''
   She worked for the pimp as a prostitute for three or four years.
She didn't work the streets; he hooked her up directly with men he
knew ``wanted a pretty woman to waste their money on.''
   ``I could not take it anymore. It got to the point where I said,
`Joyce, are you going to be a burned out whore and a dope fiend the
rest of your life or are you going to get out?' You have to make a
decision. At the time that seemed like the only one to make.
   ``I had been in his house for three days and I wanted to go
home. I was full of cocaine and he just kept feeding me more
cocaine. I was paranoid and he wouldn't let me out. He had another
woman there. The cocaine told me I had to get out. He was talking
to a friend on the phone and I just shot him and left.''
   Looking back, Dixson says, ``I knew somebody was going to shoot
him some day. I'm just sorry it was me. People try to make it sound
like he was a poor, helpless man, and what I did was such a
horrendous thing. But I know I'm not that kind of person. For that
20 to 30 seconds, they have completely judged me as a cold-blooded
murderer and I'm not that.''
   Dixson is much like other ``jailhouse lawyers.'' Their interest
in law is sparked by hope of their own vindication, but they derive
hope and meaning, and often a few bucks, from helping their
colleagues get released or have their sentences reduced.
   By the time indigent inmates realize they've lost their right to
court-appointed attorneys, they have nobody to turn to on appeal
besides the people who have taken it upon themselves to learn law.
   Many women inmates are involved in custody and divorce battles,
and male prisoners more and more are seeking visitation rights with
children on the outside.
   ``A simple letter from the courts is so hard for some of them to
read. A lot of them are embarrassed,'' says Anita Alcorta, another
jailhouse lawyer in the Florence-Crane Women's Facility in
Coldwater. She learned English as a second language, as well as the
intricacies of law.
   Dixson says, ``I'm one of only three prisoners in the state to
be accepted at the University of Michigan. All that wouldn't have
happened if I had stayed out there.''
   Yet trust in jailhouse lawyers can lead to disappointment and
retaliation, says James Jourdan, 43, who is serving eight years in
the State Prison of Southern Michigan for shoplifting.
   ``Ninety-five percent of the jailhouse lawyers are not by any
stretch of the imagination competent to represent someone. A lot of
people are pretending to know the law to take from the less
fortunate,'' says Jourdan, who claims to have about 40 cases
pending before courts.
   ``Some have been stabbed for not representing other prisoners
too well. Here, the remedy is quick justice.''
   About 59 percent of the 2,666 cases filed in the Michigan
Supreme Court last year were criminal cases, and about half of
those were filed without an attorney, says Corbin Davis, clerk of
the high court.

   It can get expensive for the state. ``I win 97 percent of all of
them,'' says state Attorney General Frank Kelley, who spends 7.2
percent of his $23 million budget defending the state against
prisoner claims.
   The 18 lawyers in his corrections division are more than those
assigned to the criminal or environmental divisions.
   Some of the suits are just plain nuisances.
   Take the case of the crushed Twinkies. When an inmate purchased
the cream-filled cakes, the worker who packed his purchase put them
at the bottom of the bag. The inmate sued the state for refusing to
give him replacement Twinkies. The litigation cost the state a few
thousand dollars.
   Others that fall in the frivolous category involve a refused
demand for a haircut, an orange that an inmate was prohibited from
taking from the cafeteria (he claimed he was refused medical
attention for want of the vitamin C) and a sex offender who wanted
to see the personnel files of female prison guards under the
Freedom of Information Act.
   More notorious was a man undergoing a sex change at the time of
his imprisonment who is suing the state for refusing him the sex
hormones to continue his transformation.
   Paralegal classes are offered periodically at all community
colleges that offer prison courses. Many inmates teach themselves
or absorb legal knowledge from other inmates who frequent prison
libraries.
   Yet, Dixson says, a prisoner in court without attorney
representation often is looked down upon.
   In prison, inmate paralegals can write briefs and file appeals,
but they can't leave prison to represent someone other than
themselves in court. They must put up with slow mail to research
materials to appeal a case.
   Regardless of the barriers, some jailhouse lawyers are excellent
attorneys, says George Krause, a retired attorney who teaches
inmates at two Ionia facilities through Montcalm County Community
College.
   ``Some of them are better than the lawyers they had before they
got put in there,'' he says.
   Dixson claims her attorney was a longtime friend of the man she
shot and a customer as well. She says she didn't know that until
she was in the county jail, but courts ruled it did not prejudice
her case.
   ``That's one of the reasons I learned so much about the law when
I got in here.''
   Some knowledgeable inmates work for Prison Legal Services Inc.
of Michigan, a non-profit corporation required by court order and
housed at the Jackson prison. The staff is comprised of 14 prison
paralegals and two civilian attorneys, including director Sandra
Girard.
   The unit assists prisoners in preparing pleadings, except for
cases filed against the department.
   William G. Ramsey, regarded by his cohorts as among the best
jailhouse lawyers, specializes in murder cases because it helps him
to prepare for his own appeal to be filed this month. He has
written arguments in numerous cases that have been reversed.
   One involved a motorcycle gang member convicted of killing two
women who wandered into its club. Another involved a man accused of
beheading another person.
   He's opposed to most civil suits filed in prison _ ``Prison is a
cancer and you can't cure it by suing it.''
   Most inmate lawyers deny taking money for their services because
it's forbidden. But it does happen, everything from cigarettes to
cash and marijuana passing hands.
   Despite frustration in their own cases, the jailhouse lawyers
plow forward to help those who need it. There is some altruism.
   ``It was meant for me to help certain people that can't help
themselves,'' says Victoria Hollis, a 40-year-old Illinois native
who lived in Benton Harbor, Mich., a year before killing her
husband. ``I have a gift where I can understand and I can do the
legal work. I have to share it and help whoever I can get out of
here.''
   For Joyce Dixson, there is a kind of vindication in her work.
Yet she remains haunted by what happened and by the man she killed.
``He was a big fish in a little pond. He was the biggest drug
dealer, he was the biggest pimp. He was very careful about how he
did things. Let's just say he was not a nice man.
   ``I was out there on those streets and I never should have been.
I got caught up out there.
   ``I'm sorry he's dead because I'm here and I've missed so much
of my children's lives. (Her sons, 21 and 19, were raised by her
mother.) But I'm whole, I'm not a dope fiend, I'm not used up. And
I'm getting an education.''

   Daniel Manville's distinction in the legal
community stems from something he did long before he was admitted
to the State Bar of Michigan. He served time for manslaughter.
   Over the years, Manville's reputation has grown in a way state
officials would just as soon forget _ his devotion to suing the
state on behalf of inmates and prison guards.
   And the Detroit lawyer would like to start a law firm comprised
solely of ex-offenders.
   ``When I left prison I really had a jump. Hey, I was white and
by then I had two bachelor's degrees,'' says Manville, who hires
ex-cons as paralegals in his office.
   ``It wasn't easy for me, but compared with other people I guess
it was. I felt that something had to be done. I've always been
someone who got involved in causes.''
   Isn't there a rule against allowing felons to become lawyers?
   ``As a constitutional matter, there's no offense a person can
commit that would forever preclude them from practicing law,'' says
Dennis Path, chief investigator of the Michigan Bar.
   ``The question we have to ask is are they rehabilitated? We're
concerned about present good moral character. Manville demonstrated
he was likely to serve the public in a fair, open, honest manner.
He's made all the right moves.''
   Manville's conviction arose from a December 1972 drug-related
slaying. Then a student at the Flint branch of the University of
Michigan, Manville, his brother and another student traveled to
Mount Pleasant to settle a score with a rival they believed had
stolen money and drugs from them. Manville used chloroform to knock
out two men, and one of them died.
   Manville, a natty dresser of 42 with a neatly trimmed beard, was
allowed to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter instead of the
murder charges on which he was indicted.
   During his more than three years and four months in the State
Prison of Southern Michigan at Jackson, Manville completed his
college degree and earned a second. A fascination with the legal
profession led him to become a prolific jailhouse lawyer.
   He obtained books that explained legal research and criminal law
in a nutshell. He experimented with other inmates' cases. His own
was futile because he pleaded guilty.
   ``There's a lot of demand,'' he says. ``But prisoners have a
very short attention span. One day they're screaming to sue and the
next they forget all about it.''
   After his 1976 parole, Manville's activities included working
for the Head Start program for the disadvantaged in Lansing,
interning at a Chicago program to combat racial bias, writing a
couple of books, and then earning a master's degree in criminal
justice. In 1979, he enrolled in the now-defunct Antioch Law School
in Washington, D.C.
   Manville's attorneys, stating his case for the admissions review
boards for the bars in Michigan and in Washington, D.C., were
unable to cite another case in which someone became a lawyer after
killing someone.
   Manville waited several years before the panels approved him. In
the interim, he worked for the American Civil Liberties Union's
National Prison Project.
   ``It's not easy. I'm not encouraging every ex-offender to do
it,'' says Manville, who lives in downtown Detroit because he likes
to be in the thick of city activity. He carries a load of about 70
cases and is chairman of the bar's Prisons and Corrections
Committee. He recently was asked to make a presentation to a
legislative committee.
   State officials can name only four ex-felons who are practicing
law in Michigan, two of whom prefer to keep their past in the past.
The fourth, Georgia Manzie, was admitted to the Michigan Bar this
year and said she wants to save her story for a book.

   Gerald McRaney thought it was time to get
into uniform after seven years as laid-back detective Rick Simon on
``Simon &amp; Simon.''
   ``I'd wanted to do a show about somebody in the service to show
the human side,'' says McRaney, who stars in the new CBS comedy
``Major Dad.''
   ``I'd gotten fed up with people in the service being portrayed
as bumbling fools or Rambos. I have a lot of friends and relatives
in the service. They're just ordinary people. I wanted to do a
sitcom. I couldn't face the rigorous schedule of doing another hour
show.''
   McRaney plays Marine Maj. John D. MacGillis in ``Major Dad,''
which opens CBS' Monday night comedy block. His new bride, Delta
Burke,is one of the stars of ``Designing Women,'' which follows
later in the evening.
   Unlike Rick Simon, MacGillis is ramrod straight, neat from his
pressed uniform to his polished boots and has his receding hair cut
so short he almost looks bald.
   MacGillis, a conservative career officer, marries a liberal
newspaper reporter who is a widow with three daughters. The
longtime bachelor, a man long used to an environment of men,
suddenly finds himself surrounded by women. The major's wife,
Polly, is played by Shanna Reed.
   ``Polly may be liberal, but she's steeped in a lot of
old-fashioned ideals,'' McRaney says. ``Rearing her children has
top priority with her. But the show's about more than just a
nuclear family. Most of the stories take place in the home.
   ``You knew that Ozzie Nelson was a band leader from the radio
show but on television you never knew what he did for a living.
Here, you see Mac at work. Some of it takes place at his office,
and the Marine Corps is a family, too.''
   MacGillis is a hardnose, which is the nature of the business,
but he's also very good at what he does. McRaney portrays him as a
man who's dedicated and cares about his job and the people he works
with. He sees the major as a man whose skills would allow him to
take a much higher-paying civilian job. He remains in the Marine
corps out of patriotism and a sense of duty.
   On ``Simon &amp; Simon,'' televised by CBS from 1981-88, McRaney
played the offbeat, casually dressed half of the brother-detective
team. In fact, Rick Simon almost reached the point of being lazy.
He rode around in an old pickup truck and lived on a houseboat.
A.J. Simon, played by Jameson Parker, was conservative, clean-cut
and aggressive.
   ``I have mixed emotions about `Simon &amp; Simon' ending,'' he says.
``Its time was due, but I miss working with the people. Well, most
of the crew's on `Major Dad.' I miss working with Jameson. I'm
thinking of having him come in the show as my liberal
brother-in-law. Maybe an attorney for the ACLU.''
   McRaney says if he had to define himself he would say he's a
conservative. ``I'm a registered Democrat,'' he says, ``but I'm a
conservative in that I believe in conserving ideals and values that
have proven correct. Some people say that's rigid, but there's a
big difference.''
   McRaney was born in Mississippi and began working as an actor in
New Orleans before moving to Los Angeles. His first job here was on
an episode of ``Night Gallery.'' After that came roles on ``The
Rockford Files'' and ``Gunsmoke'' before landing a starring role on
``Simon &amp; Simon.''
   He met Delta Burke when he did a guest role on an episode of
``Designing Women.'' He played Dash Goff, one of the former
husbands of her character, Suzanne Sugarbaker.
   ``I don't see how I could go back (on `Designing Women') again
with both of us working,'' he says. ``I told them the only way I
could go back as Dash with this Marine haircut was that I could
explain he's taking chemotherapy.
   ``Besides, Delta and I have been busy getting married and
honeymooning. We bought a place in Pasadena. We're still thinking
about buying a house in the South since we're both from the South.''
   They are developing a television movie called ``Love and
Curses,'' in which they would play a couple in the manner of ``The
Thin Man.''
   The idea for ``Major Dad'' came up when McRaney was still on
``Simon &amp; Simon.''
   ``We went through a lot of proposals,'' McRaney says. ``He was
going to be the widowed father of three. We decided that was a
bummer. Then we decided he should marry a widow of three. That's
less depressing. He was always in the Marine Corps. We thought of
making him a drill instructor. I thought he should be an officer
because a D.I. is too much of a stereotype. You know, the image of
barking at the children. We picked the rank of major because of my
age, which is 42.''

   Julius Rudel, a conductor of classical music who
is making his Broadway debut, jumped at the chance to conduct ``3
Penny Opera.''
   Rudel, who headed the New York City Opera for 22 years and this
fall divides his time between Broadway and the Metropolitan Opera,
wasn't looking for new worlds to conquer when he accepted the job.
   He did it, he says, because ``I think Kurt Weill is one of the
most important 20th century composers. I felt it was very important
to make the right approach to this German theater music of the
1920s _ the style which is not as well known here. When I was asked
whether I would do it, I really jumped at it.
   ``The style is elusive and prone to abuses. You can't perform it
like you do American jazz. Weill was such a careful composer. He
wrote things down exactly. You can't do it with the freedom you can
use in his later American music. This is slightly squarish German
jazz of the '20s.
   ``It doesn't have the rubato (tempo fluctuations) feeling. When
you hear Sinatra, he goes around bending a phrase and comes out
right at the end. That's not quite the style that applies to the
German compositions of Weill.''
   The current production of ``3 Penny Opera,'' starring Sting, is
playing at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.
   Weill, who wrote ``3 Penny'' in 1928, left Germany in 1933 for
Paris and moved to New York two years later, when he was 35. His
composing took on a French style in Paris and an American style in
New York. ``3 Penny Opera'' remains his most-played work.
   ``It has done an incredible victory march through the world,''
Rudel says.
   Rudel began his studies at the Vienna Academy of Music, moved
from his native city to New York when he was 19 and finished at the
Mannes College of Music.
   The conductor has had in his Manhattan livingroom a Jan de Ruth
painting from ``3 Penny Opera'' since the early days of the 1950s
off-Broadway production, which starred Lotte Lenya.
   In ``3 Penny,'' nine musicians are onstage, above and behind the
actors, with six more in the wings. The composer's orchestrations
are used. Actors get their musical cues from Rudel via
closed-circuit television.
   Rudel says that this production tries to go back to the
creators' original intent. ``We're doing all the music. Some of it
was not even done at the premiere. One person refused to sing one
of the songs, thought it was too dirty. There's a takeoff of an
aria that's funny and wonderful that Weill never orchestrated.
Lotte Lenya, as Lucy, couldn't handle it.''
   And there's some additional music, during scene changes, which
Rudel is proud of providing. ``Weill had indicated that he wanted
certain continuity music, almost thematic,'' he says. ``That was
his answer to Wagner, without the pomposity. I've done all the
continuity, all taken from his own music. I didn't compose anything.
   ``There were some marginal notes on the page proof of the first
libretto about using the `Mack the Knife' song as a waltz. But the
music doesn't exist for that. I went through the parts of the
original. Either they improvised or they didn't play it.
   ``I have written it out. A `Mack the Knife' waltz happens
whenever he escapes. Then, when he is brought to jail for the final
time, it is heard as a dirge. There is indication for that, too.''
   In 1928, the opening musical notes were played by an
organ-grinder on a hurdy-gurdy. Rudel has recreated that by having
a synthesizer in the wings send the music into an on-stage
hurdy-gurdy. ``Those are the creative things that give me special
pleasure and make it interesting,'' he says.
   Rudel brought four Weill operas to the New York City Opera, ``3
Penny'' in German, ``Lost in the Stars,'' ``Street Scene'' and
``Silverlake.''
   At the Met, Rudel is conducting ``The Barber of Seville'' nine
times this fall. Then he'll conduct ``Hamlet'' and ``Die
Fledermaus'' at the Chicago Lyric Opera, followed by orchestra
concerts. ``I conduct a lot, other countries and other cities. I
get around,'' he says.
   Widowed in 1984, Rudel remarried in August. He has three
children and six grandchildren.
   ``I have great respect for Broadway people,'' Rudel says.
``There is a certain mind-set you have, to perform the same thing
night after night. It is different with the opera. You have two or
three days between and you conduct other things. To do the same
thing night after night and give a first-rate performance, I find
that's very difficult.''

<TEXT>
   As in other parts of the world, the years
of Cold War confrontation between the United States and the Soviet
Union appear to be ending in Africa.
   No more do the superpowers contest vigorously and openly for
supremacy in the strategic Horn of Africa, which controls eastern
access to the Red Sea.
   Less and less can client states and insurgencies count on an
abundant flow of money, arms and other support from the world's two
mightiest nations.
   Washington and Moscow have worked in tandem to try to end a
civil war in Angola and bring independence to Namibia, and their
official utterances on apartheid in South Africa sound remarkably
alike.
   But while the growing rapprochement between the old adversaries
bodes well for some African countries, it does not signal automatic
peace and prosperity for the vast continent as a whole.
   ``Africans are perfectly capable of spilling each other's blood
without help,'' said a Western diplomat based in relatively
tranquil Kenya.
   ``Even if one could stamp out the effects of war, mismanagement
and corruption overnight, the economies of most African countries
would still take years and years to recover.''
   The vast majority of those economies have slipped backward
throughout the 1980s, a decade of healthy growth in much of the
rest of the world.
   Because they were never highly advanced in the first place, even
the unlikely prospect of full, fast economic recovery would leave
most African countries far behind the developed nations.
   And even as the United States and the Soviet Union appear to be
rethinking the cost and need for strategic advantage in Africa, the
potential for conflict remains high between and within many of the
continent's nations.
   Just a few months ago, peace seemed to be blooming like a desert
rose in Africa, nourished by a gentle rain of good works from
Moscow and Washington.
   A cease-fire was negotiated between warring factions in Angola;
a bitter, costly conflict in Mozambique appeared headed for the
conference table; a new military regime seized power in Sudan with
a promise to end that country's civil war; and the Ethiopian
government sat down with Eritrean rebels in a bid to end what at 28
years is the continent's oldest armed dispute.
   In recent weeks, however, those visions of peace have faded like
a Saharan mirage:
   _Despite admonishments from Moscow and Washington, fierce new
fighting erupted in Angola between the Soviet-backed government and
rebels supported by the United States.
   _Preliminary peace talks between church leaders representing
Mozambique's Marxist government and right-wing Renamo guerrillas
came to naught.
   _Ethiopia's Marxist government, publicly urged to seek peace and
threatened with an arms cutoff by Moscow, came under new,
threatening attack by Tigrean rebels even as it sought terms with
the secessionist Eritreans.
   _Civil war in Sudan is flaring anew with little hope of quick
resolution.
   New conflicts unrelated to the superpowers also have erupted.
   Intercommunal violence between Arabs in Mauritania and blacks in
Senegal took hundreds of lives in those neighboring West African
countries, which continue to hurl insults and threats at each other.
   Rival clans seeking power in Somalia, which forms the very tip
of East Africa's strategic horn, are killing each other in disputes
that date back to ancient clashes over water holes and grazing
territories.
   Still, there are a few bright spots and some hopeful signs.
   Namibia appears well on the path to independence in a
U.S.-brokered scheme that also brought the short-lived cease-fire
in Angola.
   Most diplomats feel the renewed fighting in Angola will end
soon, with Washington pressuring Jonas Savimbi, who leads the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, to return to
the bargaining table with President Eduardo Dos Santos.
   Lasting peace in Angola could bring a real measure of prosperity
to the former Portuguese colony, an abundantly fertile land rich in
oil, gas, diamonds, iron ore and other minerals.
   Few African countries are as potentially wealthy as Angola. Poor
to begin with and suffering variously or collectively from years of
colonial neglect, inter-tribal conflicts, falling world prices for
their basic exports, wars and famines, many have compounded their
problems through mismanagement.
   In the years after World War II, when most of Africa began
shaking off the colonial yoke, country after country turned to
Marxist-Leninist theory for economic guidance. In almost every
case, that guidance led to ruin.
   Today, even such avowedly Marxist states as Angola, Mozambique,
Tanzania and Zimbabwe are turning toward free-market policies,
adopting stringent economic controls and lining up for loans from
those twin bastions of capitalism, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
   Investors, however, are not exactly stumbling over each other in
a chase for African profits. That's especially true in the majority
of countries without proven deposits of oil or minerals.
   Even stable countries like Kenya, which rejected the socialist
path when it gained independence from Britain 26 years ago, are
having trouble attracting major foreign investments.
   ``In general terms, the continent lacks infrastructure and a
well-educated work force,'' said the Nairobi-based Western
diplomat. ``African countries find themselves competing for
investment dollars with the likes of Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and
the other emerging nations of Asia, and they are woefully behind in
what they can offer in return.''
   Nor can Africa's nations look to much increased aid in trying to
build the schools, highways and reliable power and communications
systems they need to successfully compete in an increasingly
complex world.
   Faced with budget constraints, the United States gave all of the
nations of sub-Sahara Africa $743 million last year, or an average
of about $20 million each. That's less than Congress approved for
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The Soviet Union, having serious economic troubles of its own,
gave virtually nothing beyond military supplies to a few client
states.
   The 12 nations of the European Economic Community, Japan and
other donors provided about $13 billion, much of which went for
such bare essentials as food and improved water supplies. Most
economists do not believe the overall aid figures will increase
significantly through the 1990s.
   John Barratt, director of the independent South African
Institute of International Affairs in Johannesburg, sums up the
effect of superpower rapprochement on Africa in these words:
   ``In spite of the new and hopeful international mood, including
in our region of Africa, one has to recognize that not one of the
regional conflicts in different parts of the world has yet been
resolved. Euphoria is therefore premature.''

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Here at a glance are the countries in Africa where rivalies
between the United States and the Soviet Union came into play
during the Cold War years and now are fading:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ETHIOPIA _ A staunch U.S. ally during the 44-year reign of
Emperor Haile Selassie, Ethiopia broke away after a military coup
in 1974 brought about a Marxist-led state and eventually opened the
door to the Soviet Union. However, Soviet support has waned
recently as Ethiopia wages a costly war against rebels in the
impoverished country's northern zone. At the same time,
U.S.-Ethiopian relations appear to be warming as evidenced by the
visit this year by U.S. Undersecretary for Africa Herman Cohen, the
first senior government official to visit Ethiopia since the coup.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANGOLA _ U.S.- and South African-backed rebels of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, have been
fighting the southwest African nation's Soviet-supported Marxist
government since losing out in a civil war after independence from
Portugal in 1975. However, sporadic peace talks with U.S. and
African mediation have been under way since June. The talks follow
a U.S.-brokered regional peace accord signed in December by Angola,
Cuba and South Africa under which Cuba agreed to withdraw 50,000
soldiers in Angola by 1991. Angola, in return, is seeking more U.S.
recognition, which Washington is withholding until the government
agrees to free elections. The Angolan government now looks less
toward Moscow for aid and more toward the West.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NAMIBIA _ The peace accords in neighboring Angola brought
immediate results to Namibia, which has been under South African
rule since World War I and also is known as South-West Africa.
Under the plan, South Africa agreed to grant Namibia independence
in a year-long process that included the Cuban withdrawal from
Angola and South African withdrawal from Namibia. A United Nations
peacekeeping force now is in Namibia to oversee the nation's first
free elections this month.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MOZAMBIQUE _ This southeastern African country has been in a
state of constant war since 1963. It began with an independence
struggle from Portugal in 1963-75 and continued on after that in
civil war between Soviet-backed government forces and the South
African-backed Mozambique National Resistance. Tentative, sporadic
peace talks have been under way in the past year between church
leaders representing Mozambique's Marxist government and the
rebels, known by their Portuguese acronym Renamo. But they have
been highly secretive and so far appear to have come to naught.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOUTH AFRICA _ The Soviet Union broke relations with South
Africa in 1956 and says they cannot be restored until South Africa
ends its legal system of racial separation known as apartheid. But
relations between the two countries have warmed markedly in the
past year and Moscow now espouses a negotiated political solution
between South Africa's blacks and whites free of outside
interference. That is the same position taken by Washington.

   An elderly monk slips out of earshot of the
Chinese soldiers nearby and whispers to a Western tour group:
``Chinese soldiers killed many people and arrested many. Always
remember Tibet.''
   As the group proceeds on its sightseeing, an 88-year-old Tibetan
approaches and says many people are in prison.
   ``Please help us,'' he says. ``Tell the people of your countries
to help us bring the Dalai Lama back.''
   The Dalai Lama, the Tibetans' spiritual leader, fled into exile
with tens of thousands of others after an anti-Chinese uprising was
crushed in 1959.
   Last March, the Chinese authorities declared martial law after
another anti-Chinese outburst and Lhasa today is a city controlled
by Chinese arms and divided by suspicion and hatred.
   The antagonisms are clearly evident, even to the tourists who
come to see the exquisite Buddhist monasteries and temples and the
rugged mountains set against the cobalt-blue Himalayan sky.
   A driver, told by a soldier that the Chinese had banned
unauthorized vehicles from entering a monastery compound, shouts
back, ``What do you mean Chinese? This is Tibet.''
   A 72-year-old farmwoman, her white hair braided down her back,
says that before the Chinese came in 1950 ``we were free and happy.
Now we are not happy. We hear bad things about the government.''
   Asked about the Dalai Lama, the woman cries and says, ``I pray
each day for his return.''
   Western and Tibetan sources said people gathered in the central
square in mid-October after word reached them that the Dalai Lam
had won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. They celebrated with the ritual
throwing of ``tsampa,'' a Tibetan food made of flour and roasted
barley.
   The next day police, apparently fearing trouble, banned foreign
tourists from the square. But they made no arrests as they did in
September, when several nuns were detained for calling for Tibetan
independence during a religious festival.
   Lhasa, a city of 160,000 at an altitude of 11,772 feet, has been
under martial law since March 8, when troops were called in to
quell the fourth major pro-independence, anti-Chinese uprising
since autumn 1987.
   An estimated 20 to 30 people were killed in the March rioting,
and hundreds are believed to have been arrested.
   The military has a far more dominant presence in Lhasa than in
Beijing, China's capital, which has been under martial law since
May 20 because of the pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Tourists coming to Lhasa see the effects of martial law as soon
as they arrive.
   At the airport, armed guards check the travel permits of all
foreigners. This tour group saw soldiers all along the airport
road, including one taking shots at birds with his AK-47 rifle.
   Silver metal sentry boxes with armed soldiers have been set up
on streets leading to Lhasa's central square, the Barkhor, the
flashpoint of previous demonstrations. Soldiers were on guard at
all lanes leading off the Barkhor bazaar, which circles the Jokhang
Temple, Tibet's holiest place of worship.
   One group of a dozen soldiers drilled in the square outside the
Jokhang Temple, on several instances crouching in formation and
aiming their rifles in the direction of the shrine, where
worshippers prostrate themselves and hawkers sell photographs of
the Dalai Lama.
   Buddhist monks, the leaders of the pro-independence uprisings,
are kept under close surveillance. Military checkpoints stop all
people coming in and out of the main monasteries. A monk at the
Sera monastery said its monks couldn't leave the compound for three
months after the March demonstrations.
   At the Drepung monastery, a monk said the monks there celebrated
the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama by reading
scriptures because they couldn't go to the city.
   ``We're surrounded by military,'' he said. ``We've been fighting
the Chinese for two years now but we are afraid. They have weapons,
we don't.''
   Monks who had been imprisoned for rioting said they had been
kicked, beaten and hit with electric prods.
   A monk at the Jokhang Temple said its monks also had to undergo
long hours of political sessions in which officials read documents
and warned them against further demonstrating.
   ``It's terrible. It's not interesting,'' he said.
   The numbers of Tibetan religious pilgrims and foreign tourists
are both down because of restrictions on entering Lhasa. Foreign
tourists, who can now visit Lhasa in organized groups of three or
more, are not allowed to enter residential neighborhoods or go out
on the streets without a guide.
   Tourists arriving at the airport are handed a notice in
ungrammatical English warning that they ``shall not spread the
words which is harmful to our national dignity, sovereignty,
territorial integrity or interference in our internal affairs,
shall not distribute the books, periodicals, pictures, audio and
video products and other propaganda articles which is harmful'' to
the country.
   The Holiday Inn Lhasa Hotel is only about 10 percent occupied
these days, and many small hotels catering to young backpackers,
who have disappeared with the ban on individual travel, have shut
down.
   Tourism, which brought 43,000 people to the remote mountain
region in 1987, had been seen by the Chinese as one way to lift
Tibet out of poverty and thus reduce anti-Chinese sentiments.
   The Chinese Communists in Beijing, which claims Tibet has been
an inalienable part of China for 700 years, sent the army into
Tibet in 1950 and made it part of China.
   Tibetan resentment against rule by the Chinese Han majority
heightened during Mao Tse-tung's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when
radical Red Guards rampaged through Buddhist temples, destroying
scriptures and religious statues and throwing monks into prison.
   Religious believers were persecuted and the Tibetan language and
customs suppressed.
   In the past decade, Chinese authorities have tried to make
amends by restoring temples and encouraging the keeping of local
traditions. Compared to Tibet's former feudal society, real strides
have been made in transportation, health and literacy.
   Almost all countries of the world recognize Chinese sovereignty
over Tibet. Even the Dalai Lama, in a proposal made last year but
rejected by Beijing, said China could station troops in Tibet and
oversee its foreign affairs in exchange for autonomy.
   But it is evident that almost all Tibetans oppose the Chinese,
regardless of improvements in their living conditions.
   Tibetans resent what they perceive as Chinese corruption, as
well as the lack of good jobs for Tibetans and the encroachment of
Han, or Chinese, residents in Lhasa, foreign residents of Lhasa
say. Up to 70 percent of Lhasa's population is now Han, according
to foreign and Tibetan sources.
   ``Getting ahead all depends on how you can speak Chinese,'' said
a Tibetan intellectual. ``We are angry, but there's nothing we can
do about it.''

<TEXT>
   Out here in the provinces, living is a
bit easier as Moammar Gadhafi's Libya drifts slowly toward
liberalism.
   Controls are looser in business, human rights, even television.
   ``Dallas'' is shown nightly on the non-propaganda station.
   The government is backing away from some of Gadhafi's more
radical positions, such as his burning of books in English and
French to underscore his call for sole use of Arabic.
   The governnment also allows some public dissent, although
security men still monitor meetings.
   But there are contradictions.
   For instance, private business and industry, discouraged until
mid-1987, now are allowed, provided ``capitalist exploitation'' is
avoided and nobody works for anybody else.
   ``Partners, not wage-earners'' is a slogan taken from the
philosophy Gadhafi enunciated in his Third Universal Theory, known
as the Green Book. The theory, which is promoted as an alternative
to capitalism and socialism, holds that people should rule
themselves without formal government.
   But the partners rule is ``easily worked around,'' said one
Benghazi shopkeeper named Ahmed. ``People write that their
employees are partners, and they get the permit for production or
industry.''
   While private enterprise no longer is taboo, stores still must
buy their supplies from the government in order to restrict the use
of foreign currency.
   However, that has brought about a flourishing black market, much
of it centered in this Mediterranean port of 600,000 people 360
miles east of the capital, Tripoli.
   Typically, the deals involve Libyan and Egyptian
black-marketeers and start 135 miles farther east, at Mersa Matruh
in Egypt. A brisk exchange has developed there: Egyptians seeking
work in Libya buy Libyan dinars with otherwise non-convertible
Egyptian pounds, and Libyan sellers use the pounds for Egyptian
goods to smuggle home.
   Benghazi's small stores and grocery markets sell a lot of
foreign goods _ from British chocolates to Turkish and Egyptian
clothing _ smuggled from ships or across the Egyptian border 310
miles to the east.
   Some Benghazi stores remain closed, although fewer than in the
early 1980s when Gadhafi tried to close down small enterprises. In
their place, he built multistory government supermarkets that
became notorious for their lack of merchandise.
   Shelves are less-often bare now, but goods are mostly mediocre.
   ``These shoes won't do,'' complained one customer, Mohammed,
looking at a row of footwear from Eastern Europe. ``They won't last
my son a day.''
   Mohammed, as did other people interviewed, did not want to be
fully identified.
   Like all Libyan children, Mohammed's son attends an
Arabic-language public school. He will learn English only in the
last two years of high school, but if he goes on to a university to
become an engineer or a doctor, he will find his classes will be
taught in English.
   Baqer, a second-year engineering student, said: ``This makes it
very difficult for us. We're suddenly faced with words and terms
we've never heard of.''
   Arabicization has virtually obliterated public evidence of
foreign culture in Benghazi. Only a few airline offices and a
single art gallery have names in English on the front.
   Crime and punishment also are looked at in a different light in
today's Libya.
   Gadhafi _ the ``Leader of the Revolution'' _ made a big show in
March 1988 of driving a bulldozer into the walls of a Tripoli
prison to free 400 convicts.
   ``I am not a jailer,'' he proclaimed.
   Everybody would go free, he said, except prisoners accused of
conspiring with foreign governments.
   At the same time, Gadhafi reined in his enforcers, the
Revolutionary Committees, telling them to stop making people
disappear and that only police with warrants can make arrests.
   ``Things are loosening up,'' said grocer Youssef in his
side-street store. ``As long as we keep away from discussing
politics, we're OK.''
   The London-based human rights agency Amnesty International noted
improvements after Gadhafi's 1988 moves. But it said early this
year that about 90 Moslem fundamentalists, whom Gadhafi has accused
of working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, were rounded
up and have been held incommunicado since.
   Libyan opposition figures say that the number is much higher and
that Gadhafi held more than 100 political prisoners even after his
bulldozer episode.
   Aly Abdel-Salam, a Revolutionary Committee member who works in
Benghazi's Green Book Center, insists there has been no change in
the committees' duties.
   ``I'm happy to devote my life and soul to the ideals of Moammar
Gadhafi,'' he said.
   Such are the sentiments Libyans hear on the government's
television channel, which competes with the station that runs
``Dallas.'' The government's TV menu features news in Arabic,
national songs, educational material and frequent reminders of
Gadhafi's revolutionary achievements.
   One, which touched Benghazians closely, is a tape extolling the
``7,000 Units Project'' _ huge apartment buildings scattered about
the city.
   The completed apartments remained empty for months, enmeshed in
red tape, until this past September, when potential tenants crashed
down the doors and occupied them. Residents say police began
roughing up the squatters and shooting at their cars until Gadhafi
ordered them left alone.
   While the government's TV fare wins the hearts and minds of
bureaucrats, it doesn't seem likely to win over many Libyans.
   Shopkeeper Yasser said he hopes ``Dallas'' and the British
nature films and grade B detective series shown on the channel
aren't taken off.
   ``They're the only things worth watching,'' he said.
   An Information Ministry official maintained that ``Dallas'' is
screened for the tens of thousands of foreigners in Libya.
   Most are East European businessmen or South Koreans and Thais
working on construction projects like Ghadafi's Great Man-Made
River.
   At a time of greatly reduced income from oil, basically Libya's
only source of hard currency, Gadhafi has had to cut back on many
projects.
   Not so on the river, his $24 billion pet, proclaimed as ``The
Eighth Wonder'' and ``Miracle of the 20th Century.''
   As designed, the artificial river will spring from a huge lake,
or aquifer, beneath the desert in southern Libya.
   Entering pipes from 270 wells, the water will flow into an
enormous reservoir at an oasis, Ajdabiya, 100 miles south of
Benghazi. From there, pipelines will distribute the water to the
water-short coast far to the north, where most of Libya's 4 million
people live.
   ``The aquifer is so big, we believe it's sufficient for more
than a thousand years at the present rate of consumption,'' said
the project chief, Mohammed el-Mangoush.
   On Sept. 11, the first gush of water into the pipes leading to
Ajdabiya's reservoir was celebrated with folk dancing and patriotic
songs on nationwide television.
   Libyans rejoiced as the water reached Ajdabiya.
   ``This shows that the project is a success,'' remarked a
Benghazi shopkeeper who said he dislikes most of Gadhafi's
policies. ``The water actually came in all the way from the
aquifer.''
   But what he and other television viewers were not told is that,
according to engineers at the oasis, the water was not from the new
system but from old wells, presumably to coincide with the
celebrations of the 20th anniversary of Gadhafi's revolution.

<HEAD>At the Movies: `The Little Mermaid,' `The Bear'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``The Little Mermaid'' opens Nov. 15 in New York and Los Angeles
and wide on Nov. 17. ``The Bear'' opened Oct. 27.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``The Little Mermaid''
   
   Every once in a while a movie so special, so lovely, so
exciting, funny, charming, entertaining and heartwarming spins out
from Hollywood's celluloid web. It's a moment to cherish, a moment
to embrace.
   ``The Little Mermaid'' is worth embracing dozens of times. It's
a rhapsody of animated excellence, a symphony that never loses its
polish or grace.
   Based on the Hans Christian Andersen story, the musical is the
first animated feature based on a fairy tale from Walt Disney
Pictures since ``Sleeping Beauty'' reached theaters on Jan. 29,
1959.
   Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman, who combined on
``Little Shop of Horrors,'' provide versatile, enjoyable tunes from
ballads to calypsos.
   No one does it like Disney, and Disney truly does it best. The
drawings and backgrounds are richly textured and brilliantly
colored and tinted. Animation techniques incorporate the smallest
and most insignificant nuance and detail, breathing life to both
the sea world creatures and the humans above.
   The Disney characters move not with the plodding awkwardness of
cartoon creatures, but with all the alacrity of live actors. When
the mermaid, Ariel, moves through the sea there is an actual sense
of water motion, of flotation. Her ruby hair fans out as she bobs
in place; her tail eases through currents and actually propels.
   Sebastian the crab skitters sideways on tiny claws and shoots
through the water with tiny legs moving like crazy.
   A storm at sea moves with the slashing ferocity of a real-life
squall. Evening is misty and gray; the amber glow of lanterns
illuminates the deck and crew at night; diamond-like fireworks
sparkle in the midnight blue sky.
   The Disney animators, led by Mark Henn, Glen Keane, Duncan
Marjoribanks, Ruben Aquino, Andreas Deja and Matthew O'Callaghan,
really did their homework and understand the physics of swimming,
floating, flying.
   The team of more than 400 artists and technicians spent more
than three years on the project, with 150,000 painted cels and
1,100 backgrounds utilizing more than 1,000 colors. In the end,
they produced 7,000 feet of hand-drawn film.
   ``The Little Mermaid'' tackles the tough balance between parents
and children and a teen-ager's coming of age. Ariel is a headstrong
16-year-old who loves adventure and longs to be a part of the human
world. She spends her days combing the bottom of the sea with her
chubby fish pal, Flounder, searching for small treasures from
shipwrecks. A fork or a pipe mean more to her than costly baubles.
   One evening she goes to the surface (despite her father's
repeated warnings), climbs the hull of a schooner, sees the
handsome Prince Eric and immediately falls in love.
   But what's a poor mermaid to do? He can't live underwater with
her, and she can't live in his world without legs.
   After a severe reprimand from her father, King Triton, Ariel
strikes a bargain with the evil sea witch Ursula agreeing to give
up her beautiful voice so she can have legs for three days. But if
the prince doesn't kiss her within that time, she'll become a
mermaid once again and be Ursula's lackey forever.
   The Andersen story has a grim ending. But the Disney world is a
happy one, and lessons can be learned with a little sugar just as
well as with vinegar.
   The movie is peppered with humor and sea world asides: ``Don't
be such a guppy,'' Ariel admonishes Flounder when he tells her he's
afraid of sharks.
   The voice talent includes stage actress Jodi Benson (``Smile,''
``Welcome to the Club'') as Ariel; Rene Auberjonois (``Coco,''
``Big River'') as Louis the temperamental cook; Pat Carroll as
Ursula; Buddy Hackett as the scatterbrained seagull Scuttle; and
Samuel E. Wright (``The Tap Dance Kid,'' ``Pippin'') as Ariel's
West Indian crab companion, Sebastian.
   If there's a scene stealer in ``The Little Mermaid,'' it's
Sebastian, the kingdom's musical leader, who conducts two of the
movie's most energetic and imaginative production numbers: ``Kiss
the Girl'' and ``Under the Sea.''
   ``The Little Mermaid'' is magic and joy for everyone, and
teaches us all to never lose sight of dreams and hope.
   Written and directed John Musker and Ron Clements, and produced
by lyricist Ashman and Musker, ``The Little Mermaid'' is rated G
and runs 82 minutes.

   ``The Bear''
   
   Jean-Jacques Annaud is one of those rare filmmakers who refuse
to accept any limitations of the storytelling potential of the
screen. In ``Quest for Fire,'' he created a convincing picture of
prehistoric man, employing no understandable dialogue. In ``The
Name of the Rose,'' he converted Umbert Eco's novel into a darkly
colored murder mystery of the medieval church.
   Annaud's ``The Bear'' stars a 9-foot, one-ton kodiak bear and an
irresistible fluff-bundle of a cub. Their grunts, whimpers and
bellows occupy 90 percent of the soundtrack; the rest is the spare
dialogue of the bear hunters. The film is a magnificent achievement
that will have delighted moviegoers wondering, ``How on earth did
they do that?''
   How Annaud and his inspired crew did it seems to have been a
combination of eternal patience and blind luck, with a dash of Jim
Henson's Animatronics (for scenes in which the animals are
injured). Whatever the film magicians did, the performances by Bart
and Douce, the two stars, should be studied at the Actors Studio.
   Based on ``The Grizzly King,'' James Oliver Curwood's 1916
novel, ``The Bear'' is set in British Columbia (it was shot in the
Austrian and Italian Dolomites). A mother and her cub ignore bee
stings to paw for honeycomb at the base of a mountainside tree. The
mother causes a rock slide and is crushed to death.
   The cub does not mourn for long. There are too many delights and
challenges to be found in the mountain meadows.
   Bear hunters invade the sylvan paradise. One of them wounds a
giant grizzly that manages to elude the hunters' chase. Crippled
and in agony, the grizzly at first repels the friendly advances of
the cub. They become companions, an unlikely occurrence in nature.
   The hunters return with tracking dogs, and another chase begins.
The bears seem doomed. But Curwood was not a writer to sadden his
readers.
   Annaud lets the animals tell the story, along with Philippe
Sarde's splendid music. In the first 20 minutes, only one sentence
is uttered. The bears' expressive faces and their elegant movement
tell you everything you need to know.
   ``The Bear'' is a thrilling movie, one that seems suitable for
the entire family, though the rating is PG probably because of the
relentless intensity. Tri-Star is releasing the film, which was
written by Gerard Brach. Running time: 93 minutes.

   ``Getting It Right'' (MCEG Home Entertainment. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated R)
   
   In ``Getting It Right,'' a young man has a pretty easy time
learning some of life's hard lessons. But the characters and the
dialogue are charming and fun enough to keep the movie going.
   Gavin (Jesse Birdsall) is a talented hairdresser to the moneyed
of London. At 31, he's a virgin, practically afraid of his own
shadow and still living with his parents. He does have friends to
whom he is loyal, though, and they refuse to let him sit and rot at
home. And he does have the knowledge that he's not, at the moment,
getting it right.
   So in a very short time, Gavin gets mixed up with Lady Minerva
Munday (Helena Bonham Carter), neurotic, quirky and unloved; Joan
(Lynn Redgrave), married, wiser and unloved; and Jenny (Jane
Horrocks), unassuming, single mother.
   Through these relationships, Gavin's life is transformed. He
learns life can't be lived by the book. His path to wisdom is funny
and occasionally touching, and the cast very good.

   ``Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills'' (Virgin
Vision. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   Paul Bartel of ``Eating Raoul'' fame has carved into the
pampered underbelly of Beverly Hills with a lusty satire about the
nouveau riche morons who live there.
   Clare (Jacqueline Bisset) is an aging has-been TV queen who's
trying to make a comeback about the time her husband dies. Her
next-door neighbor (Mary Woronov) is busy having her house
fumigated against termites and so must move in for the weekend with
her visiting writer brother and his new wife, a former porn queen.
   Meanwhile, their house servants make a bet with each other as to
which one of them can bed the other's boss first. But there's a
surprising twist of morals in the end, and another surprise with
the two men, as well.
   The movie ends with an almost Shakespearean musical bed scene.
   Ray Sharkey and Robert Beltran are great as the servants and
play their parts as low-key as the rest of the cast. Bartel appears
in the role of a ``thinologist'' _ Beverly Hills-speak for diet
doctor.
   Ed Begley Jr. and Arnetia Walker are great as the soon-to-be
separated newlyweds. Walker also provides the soundtrack with husky
soul voice.
   ``Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills'' will provide
a grin or three and few hearty laughs.

   ``The Bridge _ A Tribute to Neil Young'' (Caroline)
   
   ``The Bridge,'' a tribute record with 11 largely obscure artists
covering Neil Young songs is nearly as eclectic as, well, Young
himself.
   The project is dedicated to ``physically challenged children
everywhere'' and proceeds go to the Bridge School in California.
That's been a cause for Young, the father of two handicapped
children, for a number of years.
   Don't mistake this for ``We Are the World.'' The music is
challenging and, at times, amateurish. But it's true to the spirit
of Neil Young, a man who follows his muse even if it takes him the
wrong way down a one-way street.
   Actually, for a compilation album, the music isn't as diverse as
even Young's last decade of work. Young has traveled through
electronic music, rockabilly, blues, rock and country on a tour
that gave his former record company fits.
   Nicolette Larson, who covered Young's gentle ``Lotta Love'' for
a hit in the late 1970s, might faint if she heard Dinosaur Jr.'s
hardcore punk version. This is the most drastic reworking on ``The
Bridge.''
   The Pixies and Sonic Youth, an atonal twosome who are heroes at
college radio, give intriguing readings of ``Winterlong'' and
``Computer Age,'' respectively. The Pixies, like Young, have a
knack for sounding pretty just when you think they're losing
control.
   Victoria Williams and the Williams Brothers record a sweet,
homey version of ``Don't Let It Bring You Down'' in their basement.
Williams' voice sounds eerily like Young's. Nick Cave's
``Helpless'' has an expansive air similar to Talking Heads' ``The
Big Country.''
   Probably the only dud here is Psychic TV's deadening six-minute
version of ``Only Love Can Break Your Heart.''
   What's most heartening about this project, aside from the
obvious benefit to handicapped children, is that each artist put a
lot of thought into their work and managed to retain their
originality in covering someone else's songs.

   More than 750 objects never intended for a museum gallery are
being displayed at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis as part of
the ``Graphic Design in America'' show that opened Nov. 5 and will
travel to New York, Phoenix and London after its debut.
   The magazines, newspapers and maps; banners, buttons and flags;
film and television clips; posters, signs and symbols; and trinkets
from Andrew Jackson's presidential campaign, the 1939 World's Fair
and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics were designed to make a quick
impact before being discarded.
   ``Graphic design deals with information that's not meant to be
preserved forever, except if it's in books,'' said Walker design
curator Mildred Friedman, who organized the show.
   ``There hadn't been a big museum show of graphic design before
this, and now that I've done it, I understand why. So much is gone.
It disappears like the winds.''
   Once traffic signs, billboards, advertisements, posters, postage
stamps, record jackets, film and television titles have served
their purpose, they are dumped in the trash. Nevertheless, graphic
design is the world's most pervasive art form, shaping the visual
environment of the world.
   ``Graphic Design in America'' is divided into three thematic
sections _ design in the urban environment, including everything
from maps and trademarks to the World's Fair and Olympics;
mass-media design, ranging from newspapers and magazines to books
and film graphics; and design for government and commerce.
   The show, which includes design developments since 1829 in items
on loan from nearly 100 individuals and institutions, will remain
on view in Minneapolis through Jan. 21.
   Here is a list of other shows at some museums and galleries in

   A pajama-clad Paul Newman stood silently
in the doorway of a living room with a pistol in his right hand,
glaring at a young couple making love on the floor.
   The young man, his clothing askew, hurriedly disentangled
himself from the woman and fled. The woman fumbled with her skirt
and blouse and stood up. Newman, showing fury on his face, slapped
her.
   ``Cut,'' said director James Ivory. He ordered the scene shot
again, telling the Academy Award-winning actor that he had
telegraphed the slap and that it should appear more spontaneous.
   Newman and Kyra Sedgwick (``Kansas,'' ``Tai Pan'') got ready to
shoot another take, as they continued filming ``Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge,'' based on two novels by Evan S. Connell. The movie
chronicles the lives of a middle-class American family from 1919 to
1944, detailing ordinary, everyday events.
   The movie is being shot by Merchant Ivory Productions (``A Room
With a View,'' ``The Bostonians'') this fall in Kansas City.
   ``Mr. Bridge is an upper-middle class attorney, and his first
concern is that his family be well taken care of. He was familiar
with the Depression and doesn't want his family deprived,'' said
Connell, who wrote ``Mrs. Bridge'' in 1959 and ``Mr. Bridge'' 10
years later.
   Even though the movie is a period piece, it will be relevant to
today's audiences, he said. ``Details of life change, but
everybody's looking for the essence of life rather than the
superficialities of it.''
   Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward, star as Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge. Sedgwick is one of their daughters. Bridge is a rigid man
who is driven to provide a good life for his family.
   ``For people going to see `Nightmare on Elm Street' and
`Batman,' this film ain't for them,'' producer Ismail Merchant
said. ``This is going to be a sophisticated film.''
   The $8 million movie is the highest yet for a Merchant Ivory
production, partly because extensive set renovations are needed for
a film that spans 25 years. The house being used for much of the
filming has been refurnished and repainted, and new wallpaper has
been put up so it will look like a home in the late 1930s. The
decor of the house, in a wealthy neighborhood with expansive lawns
and ivy-covered walls, will be changed again as the story moves
into another decade.
   Scenes also will be shot in the Aztec Room, a lounge in the
shuttered President Hotel that is being made to look like it was
decades ago; in the Plaza, a trendy shopping district; and
elsewhere.
   Don Kling, a spokesman for the Missouri Film Commission, said
the Bridge production was expected to spend $4.5 million in Kansas
City for hotel rooms, food and other goods and services.
   Movies are rarely shot in Kansas City, and the arrival of the
cast and crew has given the city a touch of Hollywood fever.
   While Newman and Sedgwick prepared for the sixth or seventh take
of their scene one recent day, about 50 office workers stood in the
street outside the house during their lunch breaks, gazing at the
spacious two-story home. Some peered through binoculars. Others had
cameras cocked and ready.
   Four women stood near a mobile home used by Newman and Woodward
as a dressing room, poised to unfurl a computer-generated banner
that said: ``Stop. Paul _ Come Say Hello Please!''
   But locals have not been dogging the stars, who would not give
interviews while filming. Newman brushed off a reporter's request
for an interview saying he needed time to thoughtfully answer
questions.
   When the shoot inside the house ended, fans were rewarded as
Newman, still dressed in stripped blue and white pajamas, strolled
across the front lawn of the house. The crowd burst into
spontaneous applause and flashbulbs popped. Newman looked over,
stopped, and made a sweeping bow.
   Thom Marshall, who gave up his job as a bartender at a nearby
restaurant to work as a production assistant intern, hustled
forward to keep the crowd back.
   ``I wanted to break into the motion picture business somehow,
and in Kansas City this seemed like the only way to start,'' he
said. ``So here I am, getting paid nothing, doing a lot, and loving
it.''
   Helen Ostenberg, a Kansas City attorney, also got a job on the
set and is now working nights at her practice. During the day she
drives for Newman and Woodward. ``Who could resist a chance like
this?''
   Those who were not lucky enough to have snared a job on the set
can listen to the ``Newman Watches'' on local radio stations in
which listeners who have sighted the star phone in his whereabouts.
   Merchant said shooting should be completed in Kansas City this
month, and some scenes will be shot in New York. The film is
tentatively scheduled for release next August.

<HEAD>The Artists: Pop Art on the Farm</HEAD>

   Paul Warhola swats at bees and plays with pet
chickens at his 38-acre farm as he paints pictures of bean cans and
ketchup bottles.
   It's a long way from the New York art world of his late brother
Andy Warhol, and Warhola insists he's not trying to capitalize on
the success of his late brother, the American master of pop art.
   ``I'm painting for my own self-satisfaction because I like it,''
Warhola said. ``I'm not trying to profit or ride on Andy's
coattails. I don't want to copy.''
   Yet Warhola's Heinz vegetarian baked beans and Heinz ketchup
bottles, painted on stark white canvas, easily bring to mind the
Campbell's soup can image Warhol made into a pricey museum piece.
   More than two years after he died at age 58 following gall
bladder surgery, Warhol's works are hotter than ever, and the ghost
of the Pop icon seems to be everywhere. His ``Shot Red Marilyn''
fetched $4 million at Christie's earlier this year, and the
publication of his infamous, dishy diaries have tongues wagging
around the world.
   Last year, Sotheby's sold $25.3 million of items from the Warhol
estate, including cookie jars in the shape of pigs and puppies and
early 19th century Baltimore furniture. Warhol was on the cover of
Newsweek, ABC's ``20-20'' did a feature on him and Business Week
and Forbes wrote about the 10-day auction of the media superstar
who wedded fine art to popular culture. After all, silk-screened
Brillo boxes and Campbell's soup cans weren't exactly considered
art before Warhol.
   Warhola's paintings may never hang in museums, but that doesn't
bother him.
   ``I didn't want to do anything like the Campbell's soup can.
That was Andy's trademark,'' Warhola said. ``It's a lot of fun. If
I can sell a few, fine. If I can't, so what?''
   Warhola already has a collector, a friend in the metals
recycling business who paid $350 apiece for three paintings, one of
them signed, ``Andy Warhol's brother.'' Several other people have
agreed to pay $1,000 for ketchup paintings, Warhola said.
   ``They didn't get any of Andy's so they figure the closest they
can get would be getting one of mine,'' Warhola said.
   Warhola said he never understood why Warhol, born Andrew
Warhola, tried to shroud his past in mystery, rarely referring to
his years growing up in Pittsburgh's Soho district and other parts
of town.
   Warhola, 67, was the oldest of the three sons of Czech
immigrants. Warhola said that when they were growing up, he gave
his brother tips on art and bought him paint-by-number sets and
movie magazines.
   On cold winter nights with no radio and little to do, he recalls
sitting in the kitchen near the coal stove, tracing the Sunday
comics and drawing.
   ``Andy wasn't much involved in sports. What do you do in the
winter time? You sit at the table. You draw pictures,'' he said.
   Later, Warhola said he paid his brother $2 a day to help him
sell fruit in the city's warehouse Strip District. Warhol was a
student at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, and art clashed
with enterprise.
   ``What did Andy do?'' Warhola said. ``He brings his sketch pad
along. I'd be shouting, `Cantaloupes, peaches, apple, corn.' And
meanwhile, Andy's sketching.''
   After graduating, Warhol left Pittsburgh for New York City,
changed his name and rarely returned to Pittsburgh.
   Warhola always wanted to dabble in art, but raising seven
children and running a scrap metal yard in Pittsburgh left little
time for hobbies.
   Now he has retired and tends his farm, doting on 100 pet
chickens, 75 ducks, geese and 14 cats kept in the barn. Max the
rooster, a favorite, roams around the overgrown vegetable and
flower garden.
   ``I like this old country life up here. I lead a simple life. I
don't want nothing fancy,'' he said. ``Andy always liked glamorous
things.''
   Wearing paint-splattered white-overalls and a baseball cap, he
paints at a picnic table in his backyard, which is strewn with
benches, statues and a set of faded carousel horses.
   He has pressed his beloved chickens into service, putting
watercolor paint on their feet and letting them walk on canvas. He
calls the experimental works ``Chicken Scratch.''
   ``It's fun,'' he said. ``I tried one with some smaller ducks,
but they just make a mess of it.''
   He hopes to paint landscapes and sculpt brass fixtures, door
knobs and other treasures culled from his junkyard over the years.
   ``I can play around with junk,'' he said. ``Art is just
creativity. There's a million and one things you can do.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Kate Bush Myths and Realities</HEAD>

   Some myths about Kate Bush:
   _The four-year wait for her new album, ``Sensual World,'' was by
choice.
   Bush, a perfectionist in the studio, says no. She did take a
brief rest after issuing the popular greatest hits package, ``The
Whole Story,'' but said creating suitable material caused the
delay. She also changed labels, from EMI to CBS.
   _She doesn't like to perform live.
   Not so, the singer insists. This most visual of artists loves
the stage, but worries about maintaining the intensity night after
night of material such as ``Get Out of my House'' and ``Sat in Your
Lap.'' That's why she hasn't toured in 10 years.
   _Her favorite author is Emily Bronte.
   Wrong again. Yes, the title and story of ``Wuthering Heights,''
a No. 1 single in England in 1978, were taken straight from the
novel. But no, Bush didn't like the book and, in fact, hadn't even
seen the movie.
   It is true, however, that the British star has a few things to
say about love, and a few more about the, well, ``Sensual World.''
All that is no surprise to anyone whose ears have rung from her
operatic passion on ``Wuthering Heights'' or has gazed at those
penetrating brown eyes which glow from her album covers.
   So Bush fans won't be surprised that the title song of her new
record more than lives up to its name.
   A better story is how it came to be recorded. Originally, having
composed an appropriately seductive track, Bush thought of James
Joyce's erotic classic, ``Ulysses,'' and thought she had found the
ideal lyrics.
   ``The lyrics were taken straight from Molly Bloom's soliloquy,''
the 31-year-old singer-songwriter said in a telephone interview
from London. ``The words were so rich, so intimate. It was like
magic the way they fitted.''
   Unfortunately, the Joyce estate had no interest in hearing the
author's words set to music. If Bush wanted to invoke ``Ulysses,''
she'd have to start from scratch. She did, cooing ``Mmh, yes,'' and
murmering images of ``seedcakes'' and ``arrows of love'' while
uilleann pipes and an Irish bagpipe moaned in the background.
   ``I was disappointed,'' Bush admitted, ``and it was very
difficult. I wanted to keep the original sense, but obviously I am
not Joyce. But with the rhythms I had, it began to turn into what
the Molly Bloom character is about. I was stepping out of the song
into the beauty nature.''
   She calls her dreamlike songs ``short stories,'' and brings to
them a fiction writer's fascination with legend and reality. That
means imagining heists with Bogart and Cagney, summoning the spirit
of Houdini and springing from the head of Zeus.
   On ``Heads We're Dancing,'' a young girl meets a charming
stranger at a dance in 1939 and discovers she is conversing with
Hitler.
   ``I was thinking of the devil incarnate, the ultimate evil,''
she said. ``It was inspired by a friend of mine who had been to
this dinner and sat next to this guy and found him absolutely
fascinating, intelligent and well-educated.
   ``He asked the next day, `Who was that?', and was told it was
(atomic bomb developer) J. Robert Oppenheimer. My friend went back
in horror. He said he would have behaved completely differently if
he had realized who it was.''
   Obsession, like Cathy for Heathcliff, drove Bush to make music.
She played piano for hours as a child and was 15 when a friend
introduced her to Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour.
   ``He was looking for different acts and my friend said to him,
`Come and have a listen.' They came down and worked on a few songs
with me. I couldn't afford anything like paying for a studio so
Dave put up the money. We put three tracks down, two of those
tracks went on the first album (`The Kick Inside').''
   Go to a record store and you'll find her albums in the ``pop''
or ``rock'' section, between Buffalo Springfield and the Byrds. But
neither of those 1960s groups had a singer with a four-octave
soprano, or called a song ``Suspended in Gaffa,'' or ever used the
Digeridu or Bouzouki.
   Bush was inspired by British art rockers Peter Gabriel and Bryan
Ferry rather than country and rhythm 'n' blues. Instead of getting
her kicks from electric guitar, Bush fell in love with the
Fairlight synthesizer, which she began using on her third album,
``Never for Ever.''
   ``I took one look at it and said, `This is what I've been
looking for all my life.' I couldn't believe the Fairlight. It's
called a synthesizer, but many of its sounds are of natural source.
To be able to play with strings, waterfalls, anything you want,
it's wonderful.
   ``It was just like opening this great door for me, a complete
revolution. It meant I no longer felt a need to write on the piano
and fill it out with synthesizers.''
   Bush talks of colors, moods. There's the anger of ``Between a
Man and a Woman,'' the loss of innocence of ``The Fog,'' the dry
wit of ``Running Up That Hill (a Deal With God).''
   She also writes of lying awake at night, worrying about love, in
``The Man With the Child in His Eyes,'' and being brought to tears
by a bad dream in ``Cloudbusting.''
   ``All of us tend to live in our heads. In `Cloudbusting,' the
idea was of starting this song with a person waking up from this
dream, `I wake up crying.' It's like setting a scene that
immediately suggests to you that this person is no longer with
someone they dearly love,'' she said.
   ``It puts a pungent note on the song. Life is loss, isn't it?
It's learning to cope with loss. I think in a lot of ways, that's
what all of us have to cope with.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Jakes Strikes It Rich With `California Gold'</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author John Jakes had a good feeling
while working on his newest book, and he's not at all surprised
that he's struck it rich with ``California Gold.''
   The 658-page historical novel, which tells the story of a young
man who goes to California to make his fortune in the post-Gold
Rush era, has been on best seller lists for weeks.
   ``I've got very loyal readers out there,'' Jakes said while
relaxing at his home in Greenwich.
   Since 1974, those readers have helped Jakes rack up 12
consecutive best sellers. Eight of those volumes were part of his
``Kent Family Chronicles.'' Those were followed by ``The North and
South Trilogy,'' all three of which were No. 1 best sellers.
   ``I thought this book went together well. I had a good time
writing it,'' Jakes said.
   Ten years ago he decided to write something about California,
but he had to wait until his others books were completed. When he
finally found the time to write the book, it took him about two
years to research California history, and one year to write and
edit the novel.
   ``When I started making notes back then ... I was concentrating
on the early period of the ranchos, the Spanish-Mexican landowners
and the Americans who came over the mountains and by ship. The
whole focus eventually changed,'' Jakes recalled.
   ``It's always an evolutionary process,'' the 57-year-old author
added.
   Five days a week, sometimes six, from 8 a.m. until late
afternoon, Jakes labored over the novel. Working from a general
outline, he wrote about 10 pages a day, gradually weaving his
fictional characters into the historical events that occurred in
California between 1886 and 1921.
   The hero of the book is Mack Chance, who leaves behind the
Pennsylvania coal mines and walks to California. Mack struggles
with women, a devious partner, Mother Nature and corrupt tycoons in
making his own fortune. The ``gold'' that he finds in California is
oil, oranges and land.
   ``I decided I wanted the proverbial rags to riches story. First
of all, who likes a riches to rags story? But also I thought
someone who was well off would be able to get involved in a lot of
things much more so than if they were just a shop keeper,'' Jakes
said. ``With that in mind I began reading in specific areas in
California history, like the oil business.''
   Mack's character is not based on a single historical figure.
Rather, he evolved partly out of reading and partly out of
imagination, Jakes said.
   ``I like him,'' Jakes said. ``I can't stick with a leading
character without having some affection for him.''
   The book also seems to have struck a positive chord among book
critics. It's been praised for being historically accurate and
entertaining, although there's been some criticism of the book for
being light reading.
   Jakes is well aware of the critics who say that his book's
aren't great literature. But he doesn't see that as a problem and
accepts the criticism as a price of fame.
   ``I've had a great deal of success the last 15 years, and when
you get extremely successful it's tough to get good marks. You
really are a target sitting out there. I find that it takes an
awfully generous reviewer to look at successful writers
subjectively.
   ``I'm the first to admit that I'm not what you would call a
literary writer,'' he said. ``I take my work very seriously, but I
don't take myself seriously. I do the best I can as professional
craftsman. I try to be very accessible because I don't like obscure
work. So, I don't try to build in any literary values other than
the good solid values of telling an interesting story with
characters that people care about,'' he said.
   With the book doing well and a series of promotional appearances
done, Jakes plans to take some time off from writing. He spends his
winters in Hilton Head, S.C., and this year he will also be working
on a play he wrote based on Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol.''
The play will be staged in Alabama.
   Eventually, though, Jakes will get back to his writing. He's
been writing full or part time since he was a graduate student,
including the 17 years in which he worked in advertising. In
addition to his recent historical novels, he's written about 200
short stories and science fiction pieces.
   Jakes said some of his long-time fans want him to try his hand
again at science fiction. But Jakes said his next novel will
definitely be another historical one, although it may be different
from his current books. He'd like to have part of his next book set
in Europe as well as in the United States.
   ``I always have an interesting time with one of my books,
because I learn a lot,'' Jakes said. ``It's like going to graduate
school and having someone giving you money to do it. I guess I'm
just a frustrated graduate school nerd.''

   Way down south, where the Mississippi mud
would mire reindeer, Papa Noel paddles his own pirogue down a river
made bright by blazing bonfires.
   At least that's one of the stories told to explain why, for more
than a century, Cajuns in towns between New Orleans and Baton Rouge
have lined the levee with tall fires on Christmas Eve.
   The pyres, mostly 25-foot towers made from driftwood and stuffed
with bamboo, stretch for miles along the levee, attracting tourists
and townfolk, who gather around for music, food, fireworks and a
unique party.
   Some say the tradition goes back 240 years, but no one knows for
sure when it started _ or why.
   ``It's been a hundred different reasons. Which one is the truth,
we don't know,'' said Nolan J. Oubre Jr., fire chief in Gramercy
who has become a sort of de facto chairman for the celebration.
   ``They claim it was to light the way by Santa Claus when he came
in by boat years ago, before they had roads or railroads.
   ``Another reason was to light the way to go to midnight Mass.
That's why they were on the levee. Years ago, the only part of
towns we had was on the river.
   ``Another reason was to be noisy at midnight. They used to light
them at midnight years ago, and put the bamboo cane reed in it so
it would pop like firecrackers.''
   Some reasons sound more likely than others, Oubre said. One
which he acknowledged probably was spurious is that they were
``bone fires,'' lit by Indians at midnight on Christmas Eve to burn
the remains of their dead.
   Whatever the reason, about 100 bonfires up to 25 feet high will
line the river this Christmas, as they have for longer than anyone
can remember. Some people say the tradition goes back 240 years.
   ``All I can tell you is that it's over a hundred years,'' said
Oubre. ``It's just an old tradition that we kept up, our parents
and our grandparents.''
   Recent years have seen restrictions put on the fires because of
worry that competition to build the biggest bonfires was putting
too big a strain on the long mound built to protect the river
parishes from flooding.
   Until the 1980s, the bonfires were all teepee-shaped. Oubre said
Gramercy's bonfires tended to top out at about 45 to 50 feet, but
he remembered one in the St. John the Baptist Parish town of
Reserve that towered 100 feet from the battue behind the levee.
   In the early 1980s, towns in St. James and St. John parishes
decided that bonfires should be no taller than 20 or 25 feet, with
bases 12 feet square. The fire department _ and sometimes one other
government body _ is allowed a base up to 12 by 24 feet.
   ``We have been, in the past few years, building them as much as
42 feet,'' said Oubre. ``Nobody objected, so we just kept on.''
   Under the rules, only the fire department is allowed to build
something other than a teepee-shaped fire, but Oubre said he
doesn't enforce that rule, either. He only cares about two things:
is the base within the required limits, and _ should the logs
tumble _ will they fall toward the river rather than the road.
   ``Last year I think one of them built a chimney with Santa Claus
going down it,'' he said. ``They stayed within the 12 by 12.
Another group built a log cabin.... As long as it burns safely and
is constructed properly.''

   American Indian tribes in Michigan
celebrate what they call the first Thanksgiving this year.
   Indian leaders say elementary school children may not be getting
the truth when they're taught that the first Thanksgiving took
place amicably between colonial settlers and brightly feathered
Indians.
   ``We as a native people waste good energy trying to tell the
real story. We have trouble getting past the mythology,'' said Bill
Church, executive director of the Nokomis Learning Center, an
Indian cultural center near Lansing.
   ``Children are taught a lot of imagery,'' Church says. ``Our
Indian groups see that the non-native colonist had little knowledge
about using the land and had to depend on Indian agricultural
knowledge to survive.''
   The imagery and hard feelings were to be set aside during the
Thanksgiving feast, scheduled Nov. 8 at the Nokomis center. Chiefs
and other tribal leaders, mainly from mid-Michigan, comprised most
of the 100 people at the dinner, said Church, an Ottawa Indian.
   A few non-Indians, most of them with the state Indian Affairs
Commission _ which Church headed for four years before becoming
executive director of the Nokomis center _ also were invited, he
said.
   The Indians supplied the food, Church says, to begin a true
Thanksgiving tradition.
   ``We're not saying the original Thanksgiving didn't happen, but
it didn't happen in the way it was put in books,'' he said.
   Church said Thanksgiving should be celebrated at the end of the
harvest, which is earlier in the fall. When Thanksgiving was made
into a holiday, a slow-moving Congress didn't officially pass it
until November, he said.
   And there won't be a turkey.
   ``We wish we could have a wild turkey, but it's not
turkey-hunting season,'' Church said.
   Venison and possibly other wild game, fish, wild rice, baked
bread and Indian corn will be served. Indian corn usually hangs in
doorways during Halloween but, prepared properly, it is a delicious
meal, Church said.
   The Thanksgiving feast is meant to introduce tribal leaders to
the Nokomis center, which will provide educational programs about
Indian cultural contributions, Church said. Gov. James Blanchard
and other officials probably won't see the center until
construction is completed next spring, he said.
   ``At this point we're keeping it in-house,'' he said. ``You
probably won't see high government officials ... The center has
taken so long to come together (that) I want people of that caliber
to see it when it's done.''

   Thanksgiving is a typically American holiday, but how do
newcomers from countries that don't celebrate the event deal with
it?
   An anthropology professor says that even though present-day
refugees and immigrants don't commemorate Thanksgiving, they
readily assimilate the occasion into their own culture.
   ``I can see a real continuation of the spirit of thankfulness
because many of them also had rough voyages and are very thankful
they are here,'' says Patricia Maloof, adjunct anthropology
professor at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.
   Vietnamese families, for example, may observe the day by having
turkey along with more traditional pork or duck dishes, she says.
   ``They recognize it as part of the American lifestyle and adjust
and adapt it to suit their situation here,'' she says. ``It's more
of a quiet, low-key celebration with families getting together to
reminisce and be thankful for the blessings of being here.''

   To most New Yorkers and many Americans, the
Christmas tree in New York's Rockefeller Center is The Tree.
   As this year's giant evergreen from Rockland County, New York,
lights up (with 18,000 colored bulbs) in midtown Manhattan, it
joins a long line of memorable trees that began with a simple tree
put up by construction workmen grateful for work during the
Depression.
   A 1931 photo shows several dozen men grouped near the tree,
festooned with droopy streamers, set up in the rubble of the
demolished brownstones which stood on the site of today's
Rockefeller Center. Under the tree an earthly version of Santa
Claus is pictured handing out the best thing to come in time for
Christmas during the early 1930s: paychecks.
   Two years later the tree returned more formally, set up in front
of the newly completed RCA Building, the flagship skyscraper of the
new center. Since then, the tree tradition at the Rockefeller
Center has continued unbroken _if occasionally altered _ and is now
a prime tourist magnet during the holiday season.
   Its arrival, hoisting, decoration and official lighting at the
Center's skating rink is something of a ritual in itself, heralded
by press releases, news reports, and televised entertainment. Then,
right after New Year's, the whole show comes down and disappears
overnight.
   Like so many New Yorkers themselves, the trees originally came
from out of town. The tallest, in 1948, was a 90-foot Norway spruce
from Mt. Kisco, N.Y. Other New York trees have come from Yaphank,
Lake Ronkonkoma, Smithtown, Hurley, Saranac Lake, Suffern, Spring
Valley, Rockland County, Valley Cottage, and Nanuet. New Jersey has
contributed trees from Allamuchy, Morristown, Belvidere, Tenafly,
Montclair, Far Hills, and Raritan Township. Trees have come from
Island Pond, Coventry, Holland, East Montpelier and Danville,
Vermont; Greenville and Dixfield, Maine; Lehighton, Harveyville and
Harford, Pa; Whitefield, N.H.; Podunk, Mass.; and the Petawawa
Forest of Canada.
   Decorations have reflected the times. During World War II, the
tree was decked with red and white plastic globes and stars instead
of lights because of wartime restrictions on electricity. The
lights returned in 1945. Similarly, the number of lights was
reduced in response to the energy crisis in 1973, with colored
reflective disks added to compensate.

   The annual Chorus Tree celebration at the South Street Seaport
in New York City has become a holiday fixture in the Wall Street
area since its start five years ago.
   Twice a day during long holiday weekends, an a cappella chorus
of 25 to 50 singers ascends a graded steel platform in the center
of Market Square to form a living tree, singing Christmas carols,
Hannukah songs and sing-along favorites. The ``tree'' is outlined
in fir trees with twinkling lights, and additional color is
supplied by the red and green robes worn by the choristers.
   The choruses perform two 30-minute shows beginning the Friday
after Thanksgiving and continuing every Thursday through Sunday,
with additional shows Christmas week. The free concerts are at 6:45
p.m. and 7:45 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays and 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.
on Saturdays and Sundays.

   Christmas trees are beautiful, traditional, and
heart-warming. They also can make you sick.
   So says Dr. Timothy Sullivan, who heads the allergy and
immunology division at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center at Dallas.
   ``People with pre-existing allergic conditions or respiratory
difficulty should be aware that if their symptoms worsen during the
holiday season, their tree might be the cause.''
   Sullivan cautions those allergic to mold to be especially wary
of trees from commercial tree lots, which he says are breeding
grounds for mold. He adds that some trees grown for commercial sale
are chemically treated and can trigger allergic reactions.
   On the other hand, cutting down a live tree has its problems,
too, according to Sullivan. One of the most common and attractive
trees in the United States is the mountain cedar, which he says
causes more respiratory allergy among more people than any other
source except ragweed.
   And in winter, male mountain cedars pollinate, so that if one is
used for Christmas it can release pollen in the house. To identify
female trees, look for those that produce small blue berries. The
male trees have a characteristic brownish or golden color during
pollination.
   Sullivan currently is conducting research about the mountain
cedar to determine the genetic makeup of people predisposed to the
allergy to develop a vaccine.

   But Parker Brothers, which has sold over 100 million sets since
the game was introduced in l935, says the Soviet Union, which also
banned it, is now letting Russians mortgage little red hotels to

   Silly Putty was invented accidentally in a General Electric
Company lab during World War II, when its scientists were trying to
develop synthetic rubber for the war effort.
   Besides providing an instant medium for fledgling sculptors,
this substance has been used to pick lint, clean typewriter keys,
level wobbly furniture, help the Apollo 8 astronauts fasten down
tools during weightless flight, and to take hand and foot prints of
the gorilla population at the Columbus, Ohio, Zoo. Its
manufacturer, Binney &amp; Smith, also says that New England Patriots
football team members squeeze Silly Putty to strengthen their hands
for catching passes.

   One of the oldest toys is the yo-yo, with origins in a primitive
weapon used by prehistoric Filipino hunters. The original version
had a sharp piece of flint attached to a long thong. If the
hunter's aim was poor, he could retrieve the weapon and try again.
   The yo-yo evolved as a court toy in 17th and 18th century France
and Spain; a painting of a nobleman holding a yo-yo hangs in the
Louvre in Paris.
   Playing with the yo-yo is a national sport in the Philippines
and is practiced around the world. Over a half a billion yo-yos
have been sold in the United States alone since they were
introduced commercially in the late 1920s, according to the
Flambeau Corporation-Duncan Toys.

   The Teddy Bear is a namesake of President Theodore Roosevelt and
originated in 1902, when the president refused to kill a bear that
his hunting party had captured and tied up for him to shoot.
Roosevelt said it would be unsportsmanlike to take advantage of the
defenseless animal.
   Publicity about the incident inspired a merchant, Morris
Michtom, to name two toy bears after the president and display them
in his shop window in Brooklyn, N.Y. According to authors Peggy and
Alan Bialosky in ``The Teddy Bear Catalog,'' Michtom received
presidential permission to market the stuffed toys under the name
``Teddy's Bears.'' The resulting success led Michtom to found the
Ideal Toy &amp; Novelty Co.

   Like a true waif, the original Raggedy Ann was a castoff found
in an attic and adopted by 8-year-old Marcella Gruelle in 1914.
   Her father, John Gruelle, a political cartoonist for the
Indianapolis News, drew a face for the stuffed, faceless doll, and
her mother, Myrtle, added a candy heart inscribed,``I love you.''
   To entertain his terminally-ill daughter, Gruelle made up
stories about Raggedy Ann. After Marcella died, he began writing
the stories as a memorial, with the first Raggedy Ann book
appearing in 1918. It later inspired the manufactured dolls, books,
TV shows, comics, movies and a Broadway musical.

   The game of tossing disks around in the air may go back before
history, but the legend of Frisbees is traceable to a story of some
Connecticut college students who made a sport of tossing empty pie
tins from Mother Frisbie's Pie Factory and yelling ``frisbie'' as
an alert to the flight of the plates.
   An entrepreneur named Fred Morrison took up the idea, selling
disks at state fairs. In the late 1940s, he sold the idea to
Wham-O, a toy company.

Elliot Handler, Barbie is the best-selling and possibly best-known

   According to market research by Binney &amp; Smith, the smell of
Crayola Crayons is among the scents most recognized by American
adults, along with coffee and peanut butter.
   Their research also indicates that 65 percent of children in the
United States ages 2 to 7 color or draw at least once a day, for an
average of 27 minutes.
   Alice Stead Binney coined the Crayola tradename for her husband
Edwin's crayons in 1903. It derives from the French word ``craie,''
for colored chalk, and ``oleaginous,'' or oily.

   Take toys seriously as you shop for the holidays.
   To make safe and appropriate selections, keep in mind this
checklist offered by the Toy Manufacturers of America, an industry
trade association:
   _ Use the age group label as a guide and look for other safety
messages printed on the packaging.
   _ Think about other children who may have access to the toy in
your home. A toy intended for an older child may be dangerous in
the hands of a younger sibling, so consider supervision and storage.
   _ When buying toys for children under three, avoid those with
small parts that can be swallowed or with sharp points or edges
that could be hazardous.
   _ Stuffed animals and dolls should have sturdy, well-sewn seams,
and attached items like eyes and noses should be securely fastened
so they cannot be bitten or pulled off.
   _ Rubber toys such as rattles, squeakers or teething rings
should be too large to fit in an infant's mouth, even when
compressed.
   _ Electric toys with heating elements should be chosen only for
children over 8, and then only when there will be adult supervision.
   _ Toy arrows and darts should have blunt tips made of rubber,
flexible plastic or cork. Make sure the tips are securely attached
to their shafts.
   _ If the toy is painted, look for the words ``non-toxic'' on the
package or label. Fabrics should be labeled ``flame retardant'' or
``flame resistant,'' and stuffed and cloth toys should be marked
``machine-surface washable.'' Electrical toys should have the
Underwriters Laboratories ``UL Approved'' tag.
   _ Choose a toy chest that has a removable lid or a lid with
spring-loaded support that will hold it securely open. The chest
should have smooth, finished edges, holes for ventilation and
hinge-line clearance to prevent pinched fingers.
   The TMA also notes that plastic wrappings from toys and other
products should be discarded immediately. Adults should check toys
periodically and encourage safe play habits, such as following
recommended instructions and secure storage. Toys appropriate to an
older child but potentially hazardous to a younger sibling in the
house should be stored out of reach of the younger child. Games or
toys with small pieces are especially hazardous to small children,
who tend to put things into their mouths.
   Establish a toy storage habit with your children and explain to
them how accidents can happen with unattended toys. Large toys like
wagons or bikes should be protected from the elements and not left
where they can become fire or safety hazards. Encourage children to
inspect toys for needed repairs or replacements.
   To maintain crib safety, the crib gym meant to be a grasping
exerciser for your baby should be removed once he reaches 5 months
or begins to push up on his hands and knees. Crib toys should never
be hung or attached with anything that might entangle the infant.
Replace the plastic side railing on the crib if it becomes worn and
brittle from the baby's teething.

   Americans spend some $12.75 billion for toys each year, with
about 60 percent of the total rung up during the Christmas and
Hanukkah holiday seasons, according to the Toy Manufacturers of
America.
   Shopping early in the season _ and early in the day _ is one way
to avoid crowded stores and determine product availability,
suggests Stephen Schwartz, president of Playskool toys.
   Schwartz advises going to the store with a list of toys to buy
and checking the age coding on all toys prior to purchase.
   Other suggestions include:
   _ Check for small or sharp parts that may harm a child.
   _ Compare all similar products to determine the best quality
product and compare points of difference between them.
   _ Try to buy toys that will last over time.
   _ If you have any questions about the toy or where to buy it,
call the manufacturer directly.
   _ Wrap the toys as you buy them to make sure curious children
don't peek at the presents.
   _ When buying infant toys, keep in mind research has indicated
babies respond more to bright, contrasting colors, rather than soft
pastels.

   Have a one-size-fits-all stocking hung up to hold some of these:
   _Bow Biters. Cartoon beasts that appear to be chewing shoelaces
on your kid's sneakers are practical as well as trendy. Plastic
faces of Garfield, the Muppets and Snoopy ``bite'' the shoelace
knots and keep them from coming loose on the go. Bow Biters also
include original characters such as ``The Masher,'' ``Cat Zooks,''
and ``Puppy Hearts.'' The maker, Brookside Enterprises, aims this
product at the youth market but says adults have been using them on
their sneakers, too. They cost about $4 to $5 a pair at toy and
discount stores.
   _Toy Racers. These battery-operated racing cars from Japan
travel at speeds equivalent in scale to 300 mph. Lightning Racers
are about 5 inches long and are modeled after four-wheel-drive
racing cars. They come with snap-together parts which the maker,
MRC-Tamiya, says can be assembled in about an hour. The cars also
can be customized, with 40 optional parts including special motors,
wheels, gears, and ball bearings, all mimicking the real thing.
Tamiya, Inc., a leading toy manufacturer in Japan, is offering four
models to American customers _ the Avante Jr., Rising Bird,
Vanquish Jr. and Grasshopper II Jr. Cost is about $10 in toy,
discount and department stores.
   _Art Frames. That color marker portrait done by the young artist
in your household will get proper attention with ``My Frame,'' a
kit which will enable him to have one-kid shows. Each kit contains
a backing tray, clear plastic lens and snap-on moldings for a
frame, six sheets of drawing paper, and a set of non-toxic color
markers. The creator, Berdie Stein, says she wanted a way to
display her young son's pictures, and when she couldn't find
anything appropriate, came up with the idea for the kit. ``I wanted
to create something children could put together themselves,'' she
says. ``With this toy, they can frame their own artwork, then take
it apart when they create a new masterpiece the next day.'' The
kits are about $15 at art, toy and department stores.
   _Sweet Pets. Sweetie Pups and Sweetie Kitties are soft toy
puppies and kittens that resemble real breeds. These toys from
Hasbro have long silky hair to be groomed and petted, and each
comes with brush and comb, award ribbon barrette and fabric ribbon.
Small pups are available as bearded collie, bichon frise, cocker
spaniel, Maltese, schnauzer, Shih Tzu, toy poodle, and Yorkshire
terrier breeds, and larger ones as Afghan, collie and old English
sheepdog breeds. Breeds for kittens are Angora, Persian, Birman and
long-hair tabby. Kittens are about $9, small pups about $10, and
larger pups about $16.
   _Holidays with Foreign Accents. Videos of holiday tales in
foreign languages from Gessler include ``Babar et le Pere Noel,''
the tale of de Brunhoff's famous elephant looking for Father
Christmas, ```Noel a Paris,'' sights of the French capital at
Christmastime, or ``Christmas in Spain,'' chronicling the
celebrations in Madrid, which include ceremonies at La Puerta del
Sol and the Three Kings Cavalcade. Prices range from about $40 to
$50.
   _Clear Motives. ``Go-Go Gears'' from Playskool shows kids how
gears mesh and turn in a collection of toy cars, trucks, planes or
trains with transparent plastic casings and brightly colored moving
parts. And each vehicle comes with its own driver or pilot. When
the child presses the driver down into his seat, the vehicle moves
forward. The ``Go-Go'' sets come in a small (about $6), medium
($10) and large ($15) assortments.
   _From Lewis Galoob Toys: Micro Machines, a series of small cars,
boats, planes, trains and trucks; there are 195 new ones in the
1989 collection. Galoob goes small with dolls, too: So Small Babies.
   _Tuppertoys from Tupperware adds four new toys: Link-a-Lot,
linkable toys in different rainbow-colored shapes; What's Inside,
puzzle pieces of numbers or colors; Li'l Tuppers characters fit in
various settings, including a merry-go-round and a school bus;
Tote-em-Pails, a stacking toy.
   _New from Playskool are Busy Beads, with the largest version
featuring Sesame Street characters, and Dressing Pretty, with six
different dress-up play outfits. Bead sets range from about $20 to
$37, and costumes begin at about $15, available in one size that
fits 3-6X.
   _Trusty is a shaggy-haired doll which comes with a backpack
holding a story book, ``Trusty Found,'' a pillow and a note pad.
Created by Duane Benton, it has pocket ears to ``hear'' a child's
secrets and is designed to help teach children problem-solving and
self-reliance, according to the Trusty Doll Co., Kansas City, Mo.
   _Mattel adds an electronic Powersword to its He-Man character
line. The battery-operated sword, which also lights up, produces
varying sounds depending on the hand motion.
   _Hasbro's holiday product line includes Record Breakers,
to-be-assembled miniature, battery-operated race cars; action
planes called Flying Fighters, and two playsets, a sink and mirror
vanity and hairstyles boutique for Maxie, the teen fashion doll.
About $10 and $25 for the cars and planes and about $11 and $21 for
the playsets.

   There are some gifts you can buy for the whole family, including
yourself:
   _Indoor Birdwatching. ``Gone Birding'' is a combination
board-video game that will help develop bird identification skills
for family members of all ages. Actress Jane Alexander narrates the
video, which features British comedian-birdwatcher Bill Oddie and
author Peter Alden, shown taking nature expeditions across North
America. Uncaptioned shots of birds in their natural settings
challenge players' bird knowledge, with a handicapping system for
older, more experienced members of the family. The game is from
Rupicola in a two-hour VHS tape (or Beta by special order) and
costs about $80.
   _U.S.A. Trivia. What are Abraham Lincoln's hands doing in the
famous statue of him in the Lincoln Memorial? And what mineral is
mined 1,000 feet below the city of Detroit? These are sample posers
from the ``U.S.A. Trivia'' game from the Games Gang, the makers of
the top-selling ``Pictionary'' game. The company also is putting
out a second edition of ``Pictionary,'' along with a number of
spinoffs, including an edition for kids and a portable version for
parties. Prices range from about $19 to $35. (Answers to trivia
questions: Lincoln is spelling his initials, ``A''and ``L'' in sign
language, and Detroit deep-mines salt.)
   _Sharp Colors. Festive colors have come to, of all things, the
disposable razor. Wilkinson Sword's ``Colours'' packages contain
razors in white, yellow, blue, red, and green. Each comes with a
reusable snap-on blade guard. The practical side of the bright
colors is that family members can identify their own in the
bathroom cabinet, or the individual user can keep track of which
ones he's used before. Retail prices are 79 cents for five-packs
and $1.19 for ten-packs.
   _Little Big Horn. Tiny speakers from Memorex can transform any
personal radio-cassette player into a mini-stereo system. Called
Color Mates, they come in bright colors and plug into the earphone
jack for external sound. Or, if you still prefer earphones, you can
get Colorphones, also in bright colors. The speakers are about $10
a pair, and the earphones are about $6.
   _Ethel M Chocolates' holiday gift guide includes chocolate
goodies packaged in everything from teddy bears to mugs, dishes,
trays and tins. To get a catalog or place an order, call 1-800
6-ETHEL-M.
   _From Random House, the ``Octopus'' game, in which players join
Velcro-wrapped wrists, ankles and heads and twist and turn as they
entangle; ``Luminations,'' an electronic pyramid of lights that can
be illuminated in seven ways; ``Backwords,'' in which players
compete to guess a word that has been read backward, and
``Quizzard,'' an electronic question-and-answer game.
   _``One Tough Puzzle,'' by the Great American Puzzle Factory, is
an all-red jigsaw without a picture and without a straight edge.
   _The Milton Bradley Co. introduces ``Trump: the Game,'' a board
game in which players bid for real estate; ``Scattergories,'' in
which players come up with topic words that begin with the same
letter, and ``I.D. _ The Identity Game,'' in which players have to
guess your personality card.
   _The ``World of Golf'' is the 1990 special limited edition
calendar being offered by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society
for holiday giving. Created by Mercedes-Benz of North America, the
calendar features vivid photos, paintings and imaginative graphics
relating to the 500-year-old game. Proceeds from calendar sales go
to services and research for multiple sclerosis. It can be ordered
with credit card by calling 1-800-666-PUTT or by sending a $35
check to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at 205 East 42nd
St., New York, N.Y. 10017.
   _The Kodak Stretch 35 is a disposable panoramic camera that
produces 3{-by-10-inch color prints. The camera, which sells for
about $13, comes already loaded with a 12-exposure roll of 35mm
Kodacolor Gold 200 film. The Stretch 35 features a 25mm wide-angle
lens, an f12 aperture and a 1-110th of a second shutter.

   Gift-giving, for better or worse, has come a long way since the
choice was frankincense and myrrh.
   If incense isn't on your list this year, or if frankincense and
myrrh are too tough to find, consider some of these unusual ideas:
   _Is your car on your gift list? From the people who gave you
automotive sunshades comes Sno-Off, to protect a car's windshield
from snow, ice and frost.
   The cover, with a ski-goggle design, fits across the outside of
the windshield and secures inside with two suction cups. Auto-Shade
manufacturers say it will sell for about $5.
   _Elegant Lasso. A new variation on a classic is the Lariat, a
strand of pearls with chandelier crystals at both ends that tie
instead of clasp. From the Swarovski Signature Collection, the
Lariat was inspired by western neckwear and comes with a
tag-booklet to show different ways to wear it _ over the shoulder
for low-backed evening wear, the traditional front knot, around the
waist, or in a double strand. The necklace retails for about $500,
and matching drop earrings are about $135 at department and
specialty stores.
   _You won't have to go far to enjoy holiday lights and music: you
can wear them.
   Bonnie Boerer's holiday fashions include a decorated blouse that
plays ``Santa Claus Is Coming to Town'' for Christmas and a similar
sweater that plays ``Auld Lang Syne'' for New Year's.
   The battery-powered show is operated by a switch hidden
underneath the sweater. About $160.
   _When asked ``what's your sign,'' you won't have to know the
zodiac to answer.
   A company called What's Your Sign, in Northfield, Ill., will
custom imprint a metal street sign with anything you want, up to 11
characters, plus any abbreviation such as St., Dr. or Rd.
   _If you suspect a Merlin on your list, he'll probably like
``White Lightning,'' a grownups' toy that makes real lightning,
enclosed under a glass dome. Controls let the mover and shaker form
one or two streaks of lightning or a mini-storm with hundreds of
separate bolts. Created by neon artist Larry Albright and made by
Rabbit Systems, Inc., this conversation-stopper costs about $150 at
department and specialty stores.
   _A novel solution to the toilet seat battle of the sexes:
LidAlert. It plays ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' if the seat is
left up after flushing. Its manufacturer, Kaleidoscope, Huntington
Beach, Calif., says it will be priced at about $20.
   _For the person in your life who has everything, what's left but
the world? You can have the world in your hands _ if you have
Atlas' hands and can afford to spend at least $36,250.
   Rand McNally Map and Travel Stores offer a custom-made globe
that weighs more than 500 pounds, with a 325-motor and axis that
turns it one full revolution every three minutes. Hand-laminated in
fiberglass and epoxy, it's 6 feet in diameter.
   _``Class in a Glass,'' for those who have run dry on unusual
gift ideas, is a water-of-the-month club offering subscribers mail
order gift packs of bottled waters from around the world. From the
Water Centre, Edison, N.J.
   _For those who like their books read to them: Random House Audio
books on tape, including ``My Turn,'' read by author Nancy Reagan,
and ``It Was On Fire When I Lay Down On It,'' read by its author,
Robert Fulghum.
   _For hair on the go: Jetsetter hair rollers from Helen of Troy
Corp., a five-roller set, with cord and clip storage in a zippered
travel bag. About $25.
   _Diamonds, of course, still fit nicely into holiday stockings.
   A new ``garden'' variety is popular this season, according to
Lloyd Jaffe, chairman of the American Diamond Industry Association.
He says the ``fire rose,'' ``sunflower,'' ``dahlia'' and
``marigold'' are new cuts that may be seen on engagement rings.
   The ``flower'' cuts maximize some rough diamond's brilliance,
color or yield, he says.
   The average price for a piece of diamond jewelry in 1988 was
$673, Jaffe says.
   _A pocket-sized diary from Per Annum Inc. is also a city guide,
calendar and reference booklet. Guides to Denver, Miami, Chicago,
New York (Manhattan), Los Angeles and Boston are in separate
diaries and there is a 14-city Metropolitan City Diary.
   Each of the datebooks includes maps and listings for
restaurants, stores and hotels, along with weekly and yearly
calendars and a forward planner.

   Gifts you design and make yourself are often the most welcome at
holiday time. They can be done with inexpensive materials available
at neighborhood shops. Some examples:
   _Hair ornaments. Buy plain combs, barrettes, or hairbands at
discount, drug or dimestores, and decorate them either by gluing or
simple sewing.
   Beads, faux gems, ribbons or fabrics can be found at notions
shops or, sometimes, stowed away in dresser drawers. Costume
jewelry you no longer wear can be taken apart and recycled for new
ornaments. Many notions shops stock ribbons with metallic threads
or embroidery for dressy versions. You usually can find plaid,
stripe, print or moire taffetas, or satins. You also may find
ready-made satin rosettes or embroidery patches (some with adhesive
backings). These shops also may have plastic or metal beads.
   If you prefer the glue technique, pick a heavy type like Elmer's
Tacky Glue, which sets quickly, will hold fairly heavy objects, and
dries to an invisible finish. Fabrics can be attached with Elmer's
Craft Bond II, which doesn't bleed through. Gluing is the only
medium that will attach glitter particles satisfactorily.
   Sewing fabrics, beads or other decorations to hair ornaments can
be managed with rudimentary needle skills.
   You need to fit ribbon or fabric to a barrette or hairband to
serve as a base. If you're using beads or sequins, sew them on
first, then secure the decorated base to the ornament, sewing
securely at both ends for a barrette or covering completely for a
headband. For a bow ornament, fake the knot by lapping a layer of
ribbon or fabric over the base, tacking it into place, and covering
the ``knot'' with a separate strip of fabric or ribbon. Combs are
the simplest, since all you need to do is tie a bow about the right
size and sew it to the head of the comb at both ends and at the
center.
   _Painted Sweatshirts and Sneakers. You or your child can make
one-of-a-kind message sweatshirts or decorated sneakers by painting
on designs yourself.
   A line of fabric paints from Tulip are non-toxic and water
soluble before drying, so they're safe and easy for youngsters to
handle.
   Tulip advises a cardboard lining under a sweatshirt to provide a
firm surface to trace on and provide support for the fabric during
painting.Chalk on the design first; bold simple designs are most
effective.
   Large areas should be brushed on, but details like dots or
details can be added with Tulip's Slick Paint Pen. The company's
White Puffy Paint adds texture and Tulip Glitter makes the design
sparkle. Other textures available _ in craft, discount and toy
stores _ include Pearl Paint, Tulip Dye and Designer Metallics.
   The painted articles should dry overnight, then will be ready
for wear. They're colorfast and machine washable in the delicate
cycle.

   Books are good gifts even for newborns, according to Peggy
Kohlepp, associate manager of Tulane University's bookstore.
   By reading aloud to babies, parents give them a ``variety and
richness of language,'' says Kohlepp.
   And Pat Schindler, director of Tulane's Newcomb Children's
Center in New Orleans, says blocks, dolls, trains and paints
usually make better children's gifts than gimmick toys and video
games.
   ``Television toys soon lose their luster,'' she says, suggesting
that instead parents should buy toys that stress imagination and
creativity. ``The more I work with children, the more I realize
that parents transmit their values even through the toys they buy.''
   At the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Jack Lochhead
agrees that some of the worst toys for children are the expensive,
gimmicky, spectator type, such as talking dolls and bears.
   Because they do things as the child watches passively, such toys
squelch the child's imagination and limit play, explains Lochhead,
a cognitive-learning expert and director of the university's
Scientific Reasoning Research Institute.
   He says the best toys are low-cost, low-tech toys that offer
imaginative play, such as unpainted wooden blocks that help teach
geometric patterns and mathematical concepts.

   Frankly, many may not care very much. But it is
the 50th anniversary of some of Hollywood's greatest movies,
beginning with ``Gone With the Wind.''
   Those who do care, however, are in for a nostalgic treat.
Publishers, never shy about commemorating an anniversary of any
sort, have gone all out for this admittedly special year.
   A simple listing of the films made in 1939 that have become
classics would make a book in itself, which is about what Ted
Sennett has done in ``Hollywood's Golden Year'' (St. Martin's
Press, $29.95). There's ``Gone With the Wind,'' of course, but also
``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,''
``Stagecoach,'' ``Wuthering Heights,'' ``Gunga Din,'' ``Ninotchka''
and many others. All at the theaters when movie admission prices
were about a quarter.
   ``Gone With the Wind'' still is the most popular, and in keeping
with the epic proportions of the film, most of the books are
cinemascope-sized and priced.
   In addition to Sennett's book, there is ``The Art of Gone With
the Wind: The Making of a Legend,'' by Judy Cameron and Paul J.
Christian (Prentice Hall Press, $39.95); ``Scarlett's Women: Gone
With the Wind and Its Female Fans,'' by Helen Taylor (Rutgers
University Press, $35); ``Gone With the Wind'' by Herb Bridges and
Terryl C. Boodman (Fireside-Simon and Schuster, $24.95), described
as the ``definitive illustrated history of the book, the movie and
the legend.''
   Not to be outdone, fans of ``The Wizard of Oz'' can choose from
a Kansas-size field of books, topped by ``The Wizard of Oz: The
Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History,'' by John Fricke, Jay
Scarfone, and William Stillman (Warner Books, $29.95).It contains
400 illustrations, half in color, including some previously
undiscovered stills _ and an advertisement for an anniversary
videocassette of the movie.
   For film fans whose library is saturated with 1939 memorabilia,
there are others to put atop the coffee table, including ``Jean
Howard's Hollywood: A Photo Memoir'' (Harry N. Abrams, $39.95);
``David Lean,'' by Stephen M. Silverman (Harry N. Abrams, $39.95),
and ``Bad Girls of the Silver Screen,'' by Lottie Da and Jan
Alexander (Carroll and Graf, $25.95).

   Last-minute holiday shopper? Dreading the ordeal? Want to
choose, buy and get out?
   Chances are you're a male.
   By observing and surveying patrons at two Midwestern gift stores
over three holiday seasons, a marketing professor has found that
men generally greet holiday shopping with desperation, abruptness,
lateness and discomfort.
   Mary Ann McGrath, assistant professor of marketing at Loyola
University of Chicago, found that the closer it gets to Christmas,
the more male customers there are. And, she says, they tended
toward ``large, rapid, spontaneous and often random purchase.''
   ``He came into the store 15 minutes before closing time,'' she
says of one customer, ``and quickly chose a bracelet and a necklace
for his wife. Then, as they were being wrapped, he also purchased
an African beaded necklace that one of the saleswomen was wearing.''
   One male shopper in the survey said, ``In my youth, I used to
try to be creative and buy things I liked. It was a disaster. Now,
I just ask for a list, and she's happy.''
   Women responding to the survey said they saw men's buying habits
as ``quick,'' ``overgenerous but inappropriate'' and ``not as
intuitive or thoughtful as women.''
   But one woman said, ``Men make a lot of mistakes, but when they
hit it right, they do so with panache.''
   The most treasured gifts that respondents listed, McGrath says,
were those that were of sentimental value, and personal gifts that
were associated with the giver.
   Although one woman said that her most treasured gifts were ``the
most expensive ones,'' most women indicated that a gift is most
valued if they know that someone has really thought of them when
choosing it.
   McGrath's research was done with John Sherry of Northwestern
University.

   Fat doesn't have to be part of the fun during the holidays, says
Weight Watchers magazine.
   There are ways to resist temptations to over-indulge, the
magazine says, and offers this advice:
   _ Plan ahead. Have a snack before going to a get-together so you
won't be ``starving'' when you get there.
   _ Practice moderation. Make room in your day's menu for a
reasonable helping of your favorite foods, but don't abandon your
diet guidelines completely.
   _ Just say no, thanks. Think about ways to turn down food
without sounding hostile, sanctimonious or rude.
   _ Avoid high-risk situations. Stay away from the all-you-can eat
buffet. Let your guests take home the leftovers.
   _ Don't drink too much. Alcohol has a high-calorie content _ and
can destroy your resolve to resist other temptations.
   The holidays are often most difficult for people with eating
disorders and their families, says Dr. Charles A. Murkofsy,
director of the Eating Disorders Program at Gracie Square Hospital
in New York.
   ``A person with an eating disorder will often bully the family
into having turkey without all the trimmings, or refuse to
participate in the holiday meal at all,'' he says.
   Families, he suggests, should give recognition to the eating
disorder instead of denying its existence, and make mutually
agreeable compromises on food choices.
   He says the most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, a
self-induced starvation, and bulimia, a cycle of binging and
purging.

   The war on drugs has reached the preschool battleground.
   A videotape called ``Just Say No,'' designed for
3-to-6-year-olds, is being offered by Connor Toy to go along with
its Video Smarts interactive computer.
   The 30-minute video warns children against the dangers of drugs,
alcohol and cigarettes, fire, water and strangers, says Connor Toy
president Dennis Perry.
   ``Parents shouldn't wait until the child has received negative
exposure before beginning preventative education,'' says Dr. Harry
Haroutunian, family practitioner and clinical instructor for Boston
University and Albany Medical College. ``Few parents wait until
their child is burned by fire to warn that it is dangerous.''
   The video is free with the purchase of Video Smarts, a
four-button computer.

   Camcorder users filming holiday festivities should vary their
shots _ using pan, tilt, zoom or different camera angles _ to keep
the interest level high.
   But don't overdo it, or audiences may get dizzy, cautions the
8mm Video Council, a New York-based industry trade group.
   Know when to stop shooting when filming children's parties, the
organization also says. ``Though it doesn't seem long, one to two
minutes per activity is plenty, and will make for better viewing
later.''
   Other suggestions:
   _ Keep the camera stationary and let the people create the
action in your video..
   _ Don't backlight your subject. ``Backlighting will make your
subjects' features completely unrecognizable.''
   _ When videotaping indoors, consider supplementary lights to
accentuate color.
   _ Never aim the camcorder directly at the sun or a bright light
or you risk causing permanent damage.
   _ Press the ``white balance'' button before shooting in a new
setting. ``This will automatically compensate for any discrepancies
in lighting.
   _ Make use of your camcorder's high fidelity sound capabilities.
But unless you're narrating, let your subjects to do the talking.

   Yes, Virginia, there was an editorial about the credibility of
Santa Claus, appearing more than 100 years ago in The New York Sun.
It was written by Francis Pharcellus Church, an assistant to the
paper's editor.
   A true Christmas classic, it has outlived its writer, the
recipient, and the newspaper that gave it life. Its most famous
phrases are often recalled and sometimes parodied:
   ``We take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the
communication below, expressing at the same time our great
gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the
friends of The Sun:
   ```Dear Editor:
   ```I am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say there is no
Santa Claus. Papa says, ``If you see it in The Sun it's so.''
Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?
   ```Virginia Hanlon
   ```115 West 95th Street'''
   ``Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been
affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe
except what they see. They think that nothing can be which is not
comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether
they be men's or children's, are little. In this great universe of
ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared
with the boundless world around him, as measured by the
intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.
   ``Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly
as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they
abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how
dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be
as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would no childlike
faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence.
We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal
light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.
   ``Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in
fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the
chimneys on Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they
did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody
sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus.
The most real things in the world are those that neither children
nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of
course not, but that's no proof that they are not there. Nobody can
conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable
in the world.
   ``You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise
inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the
strongest man, not even the united strength of all the strongest
men that ever lived could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry,
love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the
supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in
all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.
   ``No Santa Claus! Thank God he lives, and he lives forever. A
thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand
years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of
childhood.''

   Speculation about an imminent drop in interest
rates faded as the government reported the economy added 233,000
jobs even as the unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent last
month.
   The surprising economic strength to begin the fourth quarter _
which came despite the seventh consecutive monthly decline in
manufacturing _ was largely attributed to continued local
government hiring for the school year.
   Analysts interpreted Friday's data as proof no recession would
come this year although some said the economy would flirt with one
early next year.

<HEAD>No-Recession Forecasts Abound</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a decade of warnings and threats that
Americans were sitting atop a powder keg _ because of overspending
and debts and trade deficits and waste _ the forecasts have turned
remarkably benign.
   Alan Greenspan thinks a recession can be avoided and inflation
reduced to zero in a few years, and Michael Boskin sees growth of
at least 2 percent well into 1990, along with falling inflation and
low unemployment.
   These are people with top credentials and responsibilities,
Greenspan being chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Boskin
chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. But if
they set the pace, they have plenty of followers.
   In fact, it is rather unusual to hear economists not mention the
word recession except to say it isn't likely in 1990. There are
exceptions of course, but not nearly in such numbers as in other
years.
   It is typical, for example, for forecasters of the next year to
employ caveats _ just in case _ and the most common of these is to
warn that chances of inflation or recession will grow as the year
wears on.
   It is a wise practice, because nobody really can see that far
ahead, given the economy's propensity to be rattled by wars,
financial debacles, politics, trade restraints and cartels, to say
nothing about erratic weather.
   Those warnings are not nearly as prominent this year. The
forecast by the Conference Board's panel of senior financial
executives, released today, is an example of the new genre. It
contains no recession or inflation warning.
   Instead, the panel says the U.S. economy will avoid recession,
worsening interest rates and rising inflation not just next year
but in the year 1991 as well. Only one member of the panel
expressed fear of a recession in that time.
   ``The good news from the panel is that we will not suffer a
recession during the next two years,'' said Vincent Massaro, an
economist with the board, which describes itself as a private,
nonprofit, nonpartisan researcher.
   Such a forecast, coming after seven years of economic expansion,
one of the longest ever, is remarkable. It is especially so to any
American who has listened to an entire decade of warnings about
economic disasters to come.
   The feeling of conviction is even reinforced by Massaro's
observation that, while the panel's forecast was made prior to the
latest stock market plunge, ``it is doubtful panelists would alter
their views if they were polled today.''
   The American public seems to share the confidence, since
so-called consumer confidence surveys indicate a continuation of
intentions to shop, boosted in part by a low level of unemployment
and a high sense of job security.
   Another report from the Conference Board, this one on consumer
confidence, is particularly interesting because of its timing.
Returns from consumers were obtained before, during and after the
latest stock market plunge.
   Certainly, you might think, a sharp break in the stock market _
one of those awful omens that Americans lived with every year of
the 1980s _ would have undermined confidence. Not at all!
   ``The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have
had little or no effect on consumers,'' said Fabian Linden,
director of the Board's consumer research center.
   Are Americans really that confident? Have they really adapted
that well to crises? Can an economy that already has grown for
seven straight years continue to do so over the next two?
   The no-recession feeling seems to pervade the thinking of a very
wide range of Americans, including academics, consumers, business
people, and political and monetary leaders.
   And, after a decade of economic warnings and threats, it is
difficult to assimilate and almost impossible to evaluate.

<HEAD>Boeing Strike: Neither Side Willing to Budge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREA BLANDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 34th day of a strike by Boeing Co.
production workers, neither side is willing to budge following a
second collapse in contract talks.
   ``They have our best proposal,'' said chief Boeing negotiator
Larry McKean Sunday. ``This is our final offer.''
   ``Then they won't get any planes,'' countered Tom Baker,
president of District Lodge 751, International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers. ``Boeing will find that our
members are angry and determined not to be insulted and degraded by
takeaways and phony number games.''
   After six days of meetings in the office of federal mediator
Doug Hammond, talks on a new three-year contract collapsed when
union negotiators rejected the last company offer Saturday.
   McKean and Baker said at separate news conferences Sunday that
they didn't expect any new talks this week. Hammond agreed, saying
he would remain in daily contact with both sides to determine when
to try to resume the talks.
   A previous attempt by Hammond to get negotiations going during
the strike failed after three hours on Oct. 18.
   The last Boeing strike lasted 45 days in 1977.
   McKean said the new offer addressed employees' concerns by
boosting lump-sum bonuses, cutting mandatory overtime and
increasing retirement benefits, although the total money was the
same as in a three-year offer rejected by union members in an 85
percent strike vote Oct. 3, a day before the walkout.
   ``We're waiting for the union to bring their members to the
Kingdome and vote on this proposal,'' McKean said. Company
officials were ``totally confident it would be approved,'' he said.
   The union has monitored membership sentiment throughout the
strike by weekly surveys, Baker said, rejecting any chance of a
vote on the offer.
   ``Putting it to a vote would only mean more anger,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Boeing has been negotiating under a news blackout
since Tuesday with its second-largest union, the Seattle
Professional Engineering Employees Association, which represents
about 28,000 engineers and technical workers. That contract expires
Dec. 1, with both sides saying a strike is unlikely.
   Baker said reductions in the cost-of-living provisions of the
latest offer to the Machinists amounted to 17 cents to 27 cents an
hour, depending on overtime and pay level.
   ``Really, it's a takeaway,'' Baker said. ``It's actually less
than the offer we rejected Oct. 3.''
   McKean said about 10 percent of those represented by the
Machinists are crossing picket lines, ranging from 4 percent in the
Puget Sound area, where union membership is mandatory, to 34
percent in Wichita, Kan., where membership is voluntary under state
law.
   Union leaders have maintained the figures are far lower.
   ``This is the strongest strike I've ever seen,'' Baker said.
   The Machinists represent about 57,800 workers, including 43,300
in the local district lodge, 12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 in Portland,
Ore., and a few hundred at scattered sites in California, Hawaii,
Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and other states.
   The offer would have cut mandatory overtime from 200 to 144
hours per quarter and assured workers at least every third weekend
off. The previous offer called for 160 hours of mandatory overtime
and a maximum of three weekends in a row.
   The Oct. 3 offer included annual pay raises of 4 percent, 3
percent and 3 percent, with bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in
the first year and 3 percent in the second.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the new offer contained the
same wage increases with bonuses of 10 percent, 4 percent and 4
percent. The additional bonus money was offset by lower
cost-of-living provisions and company contributions to some
insurance payments.
   Retirement benefits would have been increased across the board,
while other benefits would remain the same as in the previous
offer, Binder said. Boeing also would have paid health premiums for
November, which striking workers now must pay or go without
coverage.

<HEAD>Tapes From Probe of Poor Quality, Reports Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the tape recordings made by undercover
FBI agents investigating the futures industry are of such poor
quality they could be of little use to prosecutors, a newspaper
says.
   The Chicago Sun-Times also reported Sunday that one recording
could support defense allegations that federal agents were guilty
of entrapment in their investigation of trading practices at the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Federal grand juries have indicted 46 traders and one clerk, of
which 14 have entered guilty pleas. Trials for some of the others
could begin next month.
   The Sun-Times said it reviewed FBI tape recordings from one of
four trading pits involved in the investigation and found some
audio tapes difficult to understand. It said some voices were hard
to identify and the nature of some transactions were unclear.
   Bob Long, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation
office in Chicago, declined to comment on the quality of the tapes.
   Despite the poor quality, one 20-minute cassette reveals
apparent rule violations, when trading continued after the closing
bell, the newspaper said.
   The tapes contain the voice of a man identified as one of four
undercover FBI agents in the trading pits, apparently discussing a
scheme to prearrange trades.
   At one point, the voice tells a trader to make certain
transactions, saying if he wants to make money, he should do what
the voice instructs.
   Defense attorneys say such instructions amount to entrapment,
but federal authorities contend honest traders would have resisted
such overtures.
   A federal judge has ruled that the recordings, made by FBI
agents wearing hidden microphones in the trading pits, can be
admitted as evidence, despite allegations of entrapment and defense
attorneys' efforts to block the use of the tapes.
   Prosecutors are expected to call on the FBI agents to identify
voices and transactions recorded on the tapes, but defense
attorneys likely will challenge the agents' memories.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today removed the last major
hurdle to carrying out a $2.5 billion settlement for victims of the
Dalkon Shield birth-control device.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected a challenge by
some 650 of the thousands of women likely to share in a trust fund
established by A.H. Robins Co., manufacturer of the intrauterine
device.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case but
four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Marketed in the early 1970s, the device allegedly caused
infertility, spontaneous abortions, pelvic inflammation or, in some
cases, death.
   Dalkon Shield sales ended in 1974 but the product was not
actually recalled until 1984. A.H. Robins, based in Richmond, Va.,
created the trust fund as part of its 1985 reorganization under
federal bankruptcy law.
   The reorganization was sparked by thousands of lawsuits by women
who had used the device.
   The challenge acted on today contended that the settlement
wrongly bars future lawsuits against A.H. Robins officials and
others, and that $2.5 billion may not be enough money to compensate
all victims.
   Lawyers representing about 18,000 women who are to share in the
settlement urged the justices to reject the challenge.
   ``Greater than the risk of a shortfall is the immediate risk _ a
near certainty _ that if the plan of reorganization is disapproved
or even delayed ... the plan will collapse,'' those lawyers said.
   The justices today also turned down an appeal challenging that
portion of the settlement barring individual lawsuits against A.H.
Robins' insurer, Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.
   Sharon Lutz, a Detroit lawyer representing some women who sued
over alleged Dalkon Shield injuries, said compensation checks
probably will not be received by anyone ``for at least several
months.''
   ``It likely will be the end of February or the first of March
before individual women start getting paid,'' Ms. Lutz said.
   She said a committee appointed by U.S. District Judge Robert
Merhige may already have attached dollar figures to individual
claims but those assessments have not been released to lawyers for
the women. ``We hope those figures will be made available to us
soon,'' Ms. Lutz said.
   Under the bankruptcy reorganization plan, American Home Products
Corp., a New York-based business, has agreed to buy A.H. Robins and
fund the trust.
   A.H. Robins stockholders will receive $700 million worth of
American Home stock _ making the acquisition price $3.2 billion.
   But American Home Products' conditional commitment to purchase
A.H. Robins extends only to Dec. 31.
   ``It seems unlikely that the purchaser will tolerate the further
delays and uncertainties of (Supreme Court review),'' lawyers for
the 18,000 women said. ``The Robins plan likely wil be mooted
before this court has opportunity to consider its merits.''
   Lawyers for the women challenging the settlement say an
injunction against future lawsuits against such Robins officials as
E. Claiborne Robins Sr. and E. Claiborne Robins Jr., whose families
own 42 percent of the company's stock, is not warranted.
   The appeal also contended that ``the fund may well be inadequate
to pay the Dalkon Shield victims in full.''
   Compensation to individual women would be based on the extent of
their injuries allegedly caused by using the device.
   Rodney Klein, a Sacramento, Calif., lawyer who represents some
of the victims, said in a recent interview that women who alleged
they were made sterile by using the device collected up to $150,000
each in settlements reached before A.H. Robins declared bankruptcy.
   ``This Supreme Court case is the last hurdle for women who have
waited so long to collect,'' Klein said last week. ``If the court
denies (review), the full process of compensation can begin.''
   Lawyers for the 18,000 women who urged rejection of the
settlement challenge said that of the 195,000 women with claims,
some 81,000 voluntarily have accepted settlement payments of up to
$725 each. Others have been dropped from the case.
   ``Less than 95,000 claims will remain for analysis of medical
records to determine what smaller portion will merit significant
compensation,'' the justices were told.
   More than 94 percent of the women who sued A.H. Robins voted in
favor of the reorganization plan and settlement, confirmed by U.S.
District Judge Robert Merhige Jr. and upheld by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last June.
   The cases are Menard-Sanford vs. A.H. Robins, 89-441, and
Anderson vs. Aetna, 89-442.

<TEXT>
   The lead lawyer in an appeal of a proposed
settlement for victims of the Dalkon Shield said today that he
won't ask for a rehearing after the Supreme Court rejected a
challenge of a trust fund established by the manufacturer of the
birth-control device.
   ``It always was an uphill battle,'' said Alan B. Morrison, of
the Public Citizen Litigation Group in Washington, D.C., and head
lawyer for the 650 claimants challenging the $2.5 billion
settlement.
   ``We fought. We did what our clients wanted us to do and we have
no regrets,'' said Morrison.
   The group had the option of asking the high court for a
rehearing in the case.
   The challenge acted on today contended that the settlement
wrongly bars future lawsuits against A.H. Robins Co. officials and
others, and that $2.5 billion may not be enough money to compensate
all victims.
   Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., spokesman for the Richmond-based company,
said if the group does not seek a rehearing, the matter could be
resolved soon.
   ``The company is very pleased that the way finally has been
cleared for consummation of its reorganization plan,'' Puckett said
today. ``The road has been much longer and more difficult than we
envisioned, but it has led to a fair and efficient procedure for
resolving Dalkon Shield claims, which has been our objective.
   ``Now the company looks forward to continuing its growth as a
subsidiary of American Home Products Corp.''
   If, as Morrison said, the claimants do not request a rehearing,
the plan is scheduled to become final Dec. 2, Puckett said.
   Linda Hightower, director of the Dalkon Shield Victims
Association in Atlanta, welcomed the decision.
   ``I am so happy,'' Ms. Hightower said.
   She said she did not want to take a chance on losing the money
the group already had.
   ``If we had lost that money, it would have taken us anywhere
from one to five years to get back to the point (where we are),''
she said.

<TEXT>
   They get lost from time to time, but there are
enduring marketplace verities beneath all the new theories,
concepts, forecasts, interpretations, innovations and fads people
are exposed to.
   Sometimes you have to dig very deep for them, arduously
stripping away layer upon layer of trash, but if you persist you
will find them. And sometimes you need not dig at all, because the
truth erupts through the pile.
   It is true, for instance, that long hours, hard work, high
quality and good service are among the primary requirements of a
successful new business. Could anything so simple and obvious be
overlooked?
   Apparently it could. Scores of books are published each year
with intricate theories on how to succeed. Researchers constantly
study the subject. And consultants earn money peddling intricate,
esoteric theories.
   Seeking to find what makes for success in a new business, a
national business organization spent three years studying nearly
3,000 companies. It concluded: Long hours, hard work and good
service.
   Why are such truths forgotten? Perhaps because simple as they
are, they are difficult to live up to. Would-be business people
search for short cuts; others, spotting a demand for short cuts
move in to satisfy the demand.
   The stock market has more theories than stocks, but few of the
theories persist.
   What does endure is value. Real value _ a history of earnings
increases, the likelihood of more to come, good products, good
management and fair price _ might be forgotten from time to time,
but in the long run it wins out.
   One study after another, year after year, show that those who
stick with value in good times and bad are more likely to come out
ahead than those who fall for the popular notions and latest rages.
   It is true that free economies are cyclical; it has been
demonstrated since statistics were first kept and it will likely
continue to be so.
   It is true that a very strong economy is one that could destroy
itself, the simple explanation being that no economy can run very
long at full capacity without risking inflation.
   It is true that no economic forecaster is able to accurately
foresee the economy more than a few months in advance, and that
those who claim to be able to do so tend to make subtle adjustments
to adapt to reality.
   It is true that a little inflation is a dangerous thing, because
even three percent inflation will cut the dollar in half in 24
years. And it often true that a zero-inflation economy is an
economy that could pitch into recession.
   It is true that there are exceptions to the risk-reward ratio _
that big rewards are possible with little risk, and that great
risks might produce small rewards _ but in time the ratio holds
true, whatever they say about junk onds.
   It is often forgotten but not for long that education, brains,
persistence, thrift and many of the other old virtues pay off in
the long run, no matter how often that lesson is forgotten or
scorned or buried under the latest notions.
   Amid the clutter there is truth.

<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with postponement of Keating appearance.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee today postponed
for two weeks compelling thrift executive Charles H. Keating Jr. to
testify on the collapse of his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association
of Irvine, Calif.
   Attorneys for the Phoenix millionaire were served with a
subpoena today ordering Keating to appearing before the Banking
Committee on Nov. 21, said Julie Black, a spokeswoman for the panel.
   Keating originally was scheduled to testify before the committee
on Tuesday, but his attorneys over the weekend requested and
received more time for him to prepare, Ms. Black said. The
committee voted four weeks ago to subpoena Keating.
   The panel still plans to hear testimony Tuesday from Edwin Gray,
former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Lincoln, a 29-branch S&amp;L subsidiary of American Continental
Corp. that is chaired by Keating, was seized by the bank board last
April, two years after federal examiners discovered that it was
insolvent and recommended its closure.
   Officials expect the collapse of Lincoln eventually will cost
taxpayers up to $2 billion to cover its losses of federally insured
deposits through unsound lending practices.
   The Banking Committee is investigating why M. Danny Wall,
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision _ formerly known as
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board _ rejected a 1987 recommendation
from his agency's San Francisco office that Lincoln be shut down.
   Gray, in letters and interviews, has said top bank board
officials did not act earlier to cut Lincoln's losses because of
political intervention from several senators and House members who
had accepted more than $1 million in campaign contributions from
Keating.

   The U.S. dollar rose Monday against most major
foreign currencies in what was described as featureless trading.
   Gold prices were mixed, moving up in London but slipping in
Zurich.
   While the dollar finished higher against most currencies, it
lost ground against the Japanese yen, British pound and the
Canadian dollar.
   A trader at a large Frankfurt bank said: ``It was very, very
quiet; there's no particular trend at the moment.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 143.45 Japanese yen from 143.75 yen
at Thursday's close. Japanese markets were closed Friday for a
national holiday. Later Monday, the dollar rose to 143.55 yen in
London.
   Also in London, the British pound rose to $1.5795 from $1.5705
late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.8517 West German marks, up from 1.8470; 1.6240
Swiss francs, up from 1.6210; 6.2805 French francs, up from 6.2620;
2.0910 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0825; 1,357.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,356.25, and 1.1712 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1723.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $380.25 a troy ounce, up
from $378.85 late Friday. But in Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid
of $380.25 an ounce, down from $380.75 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.32 an ounce to close at
$378.55.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.25 a troy
ounce, down from $5.28 bid late Friday.

<HEAD>U.S. Postal Service To Provide Fax Services In Northeast Post Offices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service said Monday it has
awarded a contract to a Miami company to install credit
card-operated fax machines at selected post offices in the
Northeast.
   Under a one-year pilot project, Hotelecopy Inc. will install
facsimile machines in 54 post offices in New York City, Boston and
Providence, R.I. It also will pay the U.S. Postal Service $150 a
month rent per location plus a percentage of revenue.
   If successful, fax machines eventually will be expanded to some
8,000 post offices nationwide, said Assistant Postmaster General
Gordon C. Morison, head of the postal service's Philatelic and
Retail Services Department.
   ``We are now looking at our lobbies to help provide one-stop
shopping,'' Morison said. He said the service should appeal to
medium and small businesses, which do not have facsimile machines,
as well as to the general public.
   MCI Communications Corp. will provide the telephone connections,
said Edd Helms, president of Hotelecopy, which has fax machines
installed in more than 2,000 locations around the country,
including hotels and other public places.
   Hotelecopy also is vying for U.S. Postal Service contracts in
four other regions of the United States where the self-service
machines will be tested in an additional 209 post offices starting
early next year. Hotelecopy declined to specify the percentage of
revenue that would be paid to the postal service because of its
competitive bidding.
   Most of the machines will be located in post office lobbies that
are accessible 24 hours a day, Morison said.
   Customers will be charged $12.75 for approximately three minutes
of use or the equivalent of about seven pages of copy, Helms said.
The machines will accept most major credit cards, he said.
   Morison said a year would provide time to determine the market
and the demand for facsimile services. He said postal officials are
not worried that the new fax machines will cut into overnight or
other services currently provided by the U.S. Postal Service.
   ``Yes, there probably will be some diversion,'' Morison said,
``but we expect that eventually it will generate even more mail.''
   Morison said the U.S. Postal Service handles approximately 500
million pieces of mail daily.
   ``With that kind of volume, any kind of impact would be very
minute,'' he said.
   Morison said the fax machines would be similar to photocopy
machines, which have adorned many post office lobbies for years,
and as simple to use. However, unlike photocopy machines that are
monitored by postal employees, the fax machines will be operated
and maintained exclusively by the contractor, he said.
   The first machine will be installed in the main post office in
Manhattan on Tuesday.

   Corn and soybean future prices were lower and
wheat prices higher in light trading Monday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   The decline in corn and soybean prices generally reflected the
selloff on the New York Stock Exchange, with the Dow Jones
industrial average off more than 40 points at the time trading
ended on the Board of Trade, said Rich Feltes, an analyst with
Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn and soybean prices were also affected by reports that the
upcoming Agriculture Department crop report _ due out Thursday _
will show an increase in the size of the corn and soybean crop.
   Wheat prices were up marginally at the close, largely on
expectations that the Soviet Union will enter the market soon.
   ``How much they buy and how soon will determine the fate of the
wheat market,'' Feltes said. ``Until they step into the market ...
wheat will have difficult time to sustain a rally.''
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.05} a bushel; corn was 2
cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.38 a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with December at $1.43} a bushel;

   The Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm
of the Coca-Cola Co., on Monday announced $50 million in
educational grants to be made over the next decade and said it will
focus its work on improving schools.
   The foundation has donated to various causes, primarily in
health, the arts and education, but Coca-Cola officials said
education has become a major issue and the foundation wanted to put
its efforts only in that direction.
   The grants will be made during the 1990s to public and private
schools at all levels and to other programs that support innovative
education. Emphasis will be given to programs benefiting minorities.
   The first specific grants under the program include:
   _A series of contributions totaling $5 million to historically
black colleges and universities in Atlanta.
   _A $2 million grant to the University System of Georgia to help
establish improvements in public secondary and elementary education
in the state.
   _A $2 million grant for public and private Hispanic family
literacy programs in Texas, California and Florida, and other
Hispanic education programs.
   _A $1 million grant to the University of Notre Dame to support
minority faculty development and exchange.
   _A $2 million grant to the United Negro College Fund for schools
outside Atlanta.
   _$300,000 to Georgetown University to underwrite international
business education programs.
   _$360,000 for a pilot program currently in 11 Atlanta high
schools in which seniors are designated as ``mentors'' to help
freshmen cope with the pressures of the high school environment.

<HEAD>Coniston Tries to Ruffle UAL's Feathers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners wants to ruffle the feathers of
UAL Corp. and force a payday for investors, but it's unclear
whether its efforts to shake up United Airlines' parent will fly
with shareholders and fractious unions, analysts said Monday.
   Coniston, a New York investment group, has made money from
United before, when it helped force the airline's former parent,
Allegis Corp., to restructure in 1987.
   This time, Coniston has formed a group named Condor Partners,
comprised of the Coniston investors who are interested in
Chicago-based UAL.
   Things may be more complicated the second time around, in the
wake of a failed $6.75 billion buyout attempt by a pilot-management
group and with United's three largest unions seeking new contracts.
   ``At this point all they (Coniston) are is a 10 percent
shareholder that's got a wish list,'' said Stephen Dexter, an
airline analyst with Kemper Financial Services Inc. ``Part of the
wish list is some sort of transaction that would involve probably
an immediate payout to shareholders.''
   On Friday, Coniston said it had accumulated a 9.7 percent stake
in UAL and wanted to trim UAL's board of directors from 16 to five
members, three of whom would be Coniston principals.
   If the group wins over shareholders to the plan, it would be
able to steer the company townd payoff,'' Dexter said. ``But it does weaken
the
airline.''
   To raise the money for such a transaction, UAL would likely have
to sell its planes and lease them back, or borrow the money.
   Either option would handicap United, the nation's second-largest
airline, in a fiercely competitive industry.
   Stock speculators who may have suffered big losses when the
pilot-management proposal fell through on Oct. 13 would jump for
any deal, Dexter predicted.
   ``The arbitrageurs would immediately support any effort by
Coniston or anyone else to get the value of this stock back up, no
matter what it is,'' he said.
   Long-term UAL shareholders may be more cautious, said Louis A.
Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia.
   ``I think they're going to want to see more definite signs of
what's behind the strategy of Coniston Partners,'' he said. ``They
(Coniston) haven't defined what they want to do specifically enough
to make people just jump on the bandwagon.''

   Stock prices dropped sharply today amid
persistent concern over the outlook for interest rates and
corporate profits.
   Wall Street's view of prospects for corporate earnings has
worsened steadily over the past few weeks as reports for the third
quarter of the year came in below expectations.
   Analysts noted that the first few indications for the fourth
quarter have also been negative.
   That concern had been at least partly counterbalanced by hopes
that the Federal Reserve might soon relax its credit policy
further, in order to cushion the impact of slowing economic growth.
   But last Friday's stronger-than-expected employment figures for
October dampened that speculation.

   Shares in Euro Disneyland SCA rose sharply Monday,
the first day of official trading on London and Paris stock
exchanges.
   Euro Disneyland, which is half-owned by Walt Disney Co., has
sold about $1 billion worth of stock to investors throughout Europe
to help pay for a new Disney theme park to be opened in France in
1992.
   Euro Disneyland shares closed at 879 pence, or $13.80, a share
in London, up from the offer price of 707 pence, or $11.10, a share
but below the mnday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.89
percent last week.
   That was up from 7.81 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Continental's Profit More Than Doubles in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines more than doubled its
earnings for the third quarter, partly because of the sale of some
assets, the airline announced Monday.
   For the three months ending Sept. 30, Continental had net income
of $43.5 million on revenue of $1.34 billion, compared with net
income of $15.2 million on revenue of $1.26 billion in the same
quarter in 1988.
   Continental does not report earnings on a per-share basis
because it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texas Air Corp. In late
August, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said he was considering a
sale of all or part of Continental because its business was being
hurt by the long-running strike against Eastern Airlines, the other
big Texas Air subsidiary.
   Continental's income for the quarter includes a one-time gain of
$11.3 million, mainly from ``sales of unspecified assets, including
some slots at airports,'' said Continental spokesman Art Kent, who
declined to be more specific.
   Mickey Foret, who was named president of Houston-based
Continental last week, said in a statement: ``The third-quarter
performance continues the pattern of strong financial improvement
at Continental, from the difficult merger environment of the last
two years.''
   ``Our customers tell us they are pleased by what they see, and
that reaction to our service is being increasingly reflected
directly on the bottom line,'' he said.
   Texas Air usually announces its financial statements to include
both Continental and sister carrier Eastern, but Kent said Texas
Air decided to release Continental's earnings separately because it
was ``so pleased'' with the results.
   Earnings statements from Texas Air and Eastern, which is in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, are expected in several days,
he said.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Continental posted net income
of $59.1 million on revenue of $3.9 billion, compared with a net
loss of $216.3 million on revenue of $3.6 billion for the same
period in 1988.
   Foret was named president when Joseph Corr resigned after less
than 10 months on the job. While remaining as Texas Air chairman,
Lorenzo was named Continental's chairman and chief executive
officer, positions which Corr also held.
   Foret is the seventh Continental president in as many years.

   The dollar ended higher Monday against most key
currencies in quiet, uninspired trading.
   Gold prices also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery closed at $381.50 a troy ounce,
up $3 from Friday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late
bid for gold at $380.25 an ounce, up $2.55.
   Currency traders said technical factors within the market,
fueled by continued firmness in U.S. interest rates, were largely
responsible for the dollar's rise in New York.
   Overseas, trading was also described as featureless.
   ``It was very, very quiet; there's no particular trend at the
moment,'' said a trader at a large Frankfurt bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 143.45 yen, down 0.30 yen from
Thursday. Japanese markets were closed Friday for a national
holiday. The dollar rose to 143.55 yen in London, and to 143.85 yen
in New York, up from 143.25 yen Friday.
   The dollar fell against the pound. Sterling rose in London to
$1.5795 from $1.5705 late Friday, and in New York to $1.5767 from
$1.5685.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's

1.6245 Swiss francs, up from 1.6205; 6.2820 French francs, up from
6.2630; 1,356.50 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.17075 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.17235.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday: 1.8517 West
German marks, up from 1.8470; 1.6240 Swiss francs, up from 1.6210;
6.2805 French francs, up from 6.2620; 2.0910 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.0825; 1,357.25 Italian lire, up from 1,356.25, and 1.1712
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1723.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $380.25 an ounce from
$378.85 late Friday. But in Zurich, gold fell to $380.25 an ounce
from $380.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.32 an ounce to close at
$378.55.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.238 a troy ounce from $5.227 late
Friday. Silver slipped in London to $5.25 an ounce from $5.28.

   Worries about corporate profits and
interest-rate uncertainties combined to drive stock prices sharply
lower in a ``blue Monday'' atmosphere on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 47.34 points to
2,582.17, the lowest close since its 190-point dive to 2,569.26 on
Friday, Oct. 13.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
355 up, 1,180 down and 441 unchanged.
   Wall Street's view of prospects for corporate earnings has
worsened steadily over the past few weeks as reports for the third

   Analysts noted that the first few indications for the fourth

   That concern had been at least partly counterbalanced by hopes

further, in order to cushion the impact of slowing economic growth.
   But last Friday's stronger-than-expected employment figures for
October dampened that speculation.
   Interest rates rose a bit in the credit markets, putting yields
of long-term government bonds in the 7.95 percent-8 percent range.
   Auto stocks were especially hard hit by worries about the profit
outlook. Ford Motor dropped 1} to 43~; General Motors 1] to 43, and
Chrysler 1[ to 19~.
   Computer and technology issues were also weak with many analysts
scaling back their estimates of business spending in the months
ahead. International Business Machines fell 1~ to 96|;
Hewlett-Packard 1{ to 42\; Honeywell 1[ to 80{, and Digital
Equipment 1] to 88[.
   Other losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down

   Ryder System gained 1\ to 22} in active trading. Itel Corp.
served notice of its intentions to buy at least $15 million of
Ryder's stock.
   Some precious-metals issues moved up in tandem with world gold
prices. Placer Dome rose { to 18; ASA Ltd. } to 52]; Newmont Gold
1~ to 43~, and American Barrick Resources \ to 29[.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 135.48 million
shares, against 131.50 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 169.44 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices ended mixed Monday in
sluggish trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
closed down 11 cents at $20.10 a 42-gallon barrel. The January
contract ended at $19.79 a barrel, 8 cents lower.
   Analysts said crude prices came under light trading pressure
mainly from profit-taking after last week's gains.
   Refined products traded on the exchange finished mixed. No. 2
heating oil for December delivery lost 0.46 cent to 59.66 cents a
gallon, while wholesale unleaded gasoline for December gained 0.33
cent to 52.46 cents a gallon. Contracts for later delivery also
ended mixed.
   ``People were buying gasoline and selling heating oil on a
spread basis,'' said Peter Beutel, energy analyst for Elders
Futures Inc.
   Traders said the weakness in crude prices did not reflect
concern about escalating production by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Recent estimates have put OPEC
output at 22.5 million barrels a day or more in October and some
analysts predict that prices could begin to suffer as supply
outstrips demand on world markets.
   The cartel's quota is 20.5 million barrels a day.
   OPEC is scheduled to meet on Nov. 25 in Vienna, Austria, to
discuss strategy for 1990, including re-allocation of quotas among
its 13 member nations.
   ``The OPEC meeting is still in the back of people's minds,''
said Brendan Dolan, trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``But
it's not playing a major role yet. Maybe a week beforehand, people
will start to take positions.''

   Lawyers for Dalkon Shield victims said
Monday that there would be no further challenge to a $2.5 billion
trust fund established by the manufacturer of the birth-control
device after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected their appeals.
   The group, which represented about 650 of the more than 300,000
women likely to share in the trust, has 25 days to ask the high
court for a rehearing. But Alan B. Morrison, lead lawyer for the
claimants, said ``it would be futile.''
   ``It always was an uphill battle. We fought. We did what our
clients wanted us to do and we have no regrets,'' said Morrison, of
the Public Citizen Litigation Group in Washington, D.C.
   The group had contended that the trust settlement wrongly barred
future lawsuits against officials of A.H. Robins Co., maker of the
Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, and that the $2.5 billion may
not be enough money to compensate all victims.
   But the Supreme Court rejected that challenge Monday, with one
dissenting vote.
   Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., a spokesman for Richmond-based Robins,
said if the group does not seek a rehearing, ``It will be over.''
   Puckett said the company could soon complete its federal
bankruptcy reorganization and planned merger with American Home
Products Corp., a New York-based consumer products company. The
merger is scheduled to become finalized by next month.
   Some of the Dalkon Shield victims also expressed relief with the
Supreme Court's decision.
   ``I never saw the possibility of getting any more money than we
already had, and I really hated to take a chance on losing that
money,'' said Linda Hightower, director of the Dalkon Shield
Victims Association in Atlanta.
   ``If we had lost that money, it would have taken us anywhere
from one to five years to get back to the point (to where we are).''
   Michael Sheppard, director of the trust's claims resolution
facility, said the trust will receive the money by mid-December. He
said the trust has set the end of February as a target date to send
a packet of information and a questionnaire to people with
outstanding claims.
   ``We'll start paying as soon as those packets come back with the
full questionaire filled out and the necessary medical records,''
Sheppard said. ``We'll probably be paying some claims in March.''
   Marketed in the early 1970s, the Dalkon Shield allegedly caused
infertility, spontaneous abortions, pelvic inflammation or, in some
cases, death.
   Sheppard said 42 percent of the claims already have been paid
through the first of four options available to claimants. Under
that option, women who suffered minor injuries from the Dalkon
Shield receive $725; a husband or child injured as a result of the
birth control device can receive $300; and those whose claims
involve conflicting information can receive $125.
   No claims have been paid under the other options.
   Option two is for people whose injuries require a limited review
of medical records; option three is for more seriously injured
claimants whose injuries will require a full review of medical
records, Sheppard said.
   Under option four, claimants who believe their injuries will get
worse or who believe an injury has not manifested itself can defer
a review of medical records, he said.
   ``Many of these women have been waiting for years for resolution
of their claims,'' Sheppard said. ``This is a major step forward.''

   Precious metal futures prices rose Monday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as traders reacted to the decline in prices on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mixed, sugar
was lower, energy futures were mixed, copper prices fell and
livestock and pork futures were higher.
   Gold futures settled $2.80 to $3.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in November at $381.50 a troy ounce; silver was 0.8 cent
to 1.2 cents higher with November at $5.238 a troy ounce.
   There was some profit taking early in gold trading on signs the
strength the metal showed last week was weakening, said Don
Tierney, an analyst with Stanley Bell &amp; Co. in New York.
   But he said gold prices improved as stock prices declined during
the day. The Dow Jones industrial average wound up with a loss of
47.34 points to close at 2,582.17, the lowest close since its
190-point dive to 2,569.26 on Friday, Oct. 13.
   He said nervousness over the weakening stock market has sparked
investor interest in gold and silver as a ``safe haven.''
   Tierney also noted that the volume of trades in gold and silver
has shown an increase, an indication that new buyers are entering
the market.
   Corn and soybean future prices were lower and wheat prices
higher in light trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn and soybea prices were affected by reports that the
upcoming Agriculture Department crop report _ due out Thursday _
will show an increase in the size of the corn and soybean crop.
   Wheat prices were up marginally at the close, largely on
expectations that the Soviet Union will enter the market soon.
   Wheat settled { cent to 1} cents higher with December at $4.06 a
bushel; corn was 1} cents lower to \ cent higher with December at
$2.38\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with December
at $1.43} a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents to 5\ cents lower with
November at $5.64{ a bushel.
   Sugar prices drifted slightly lower on New York's Coffee, Sugar
&amp; Cocoa Exchange as the market reacted indifferently to Brazil's
announcement it was not considering diverting sugar marked for
export to the domestic market.
   Sugar prices surged to 15-month highs last week on reports that
demand was outstripping supply and news that Brazil would cut
exports.
   ``The news that we have so far is reflected in the price,'' said
Harry Schwartz, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. in
New York. ``Unless there is a surprise later ... sugar is fairly
valued.''
   Sugar was .07 cent to .13 cent lower with January at 14.02 cents
a pound.
   Despite the absence of fundamental news, energy prices were
mostly lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 11 cents lower
with December at $20.10 a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent to .46
cents lower with December at 59.66 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent lower to .33 cent higher with December at
52.46 a gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were mostly higher in moderate
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cash prices helped lift live cattle prices, which helped support
feeder cattle futures.
   Hog futures were helped by spread liquidation, the selling of
frozen pork bellies to buy live hogs, said Paul Georgy, an analyst
with Allendale, Inc. in Chicago.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .30 cent higher with December at
74.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with November at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to
.77 cent higher with December at 47.72 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .15 cent lower to .47 cent higher with February at
59.55 cents a pound.
   Copper prices were lower on the Comex on reports copper stocks
in London Metals Exchange-approved warehouses increased by 14,000
tons.
   Falling copper prices also reflect the reduction of labor strife
in several copper producing nations, analysts say.
   Copper was 2.90 cents to 2.95 cents lower with November at
$1.0925 a pound.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese companies are building plants in this
country to ride U.S. coattails into European markets in the next
decade, Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens said Monday.
   Pickens also told a news conference at the National Press Club
that legislation may be needed to restrict Japanese investment in
this country until the Japanese open up their financial markets.
   ``I think you're going to have to do something about closing
these markets until you can get some adjustment from the
Japanese,'' said Pickens, who later testified before a Senate
subcommittee on U.S.-Japanese trade relations.
   At the news conference, Pickens said the Japanese want their
American-made products to be considered American after
inter-European trade barriers come down after 1992.
   It is expected that non-European countries will have a tougher
time selling their goods there, however.
   ``The Japanese are very astute,'' Pickens told a news conference
``The Japanese are building plants in the United States to coattail
the United States into European markets in 1992.''
   He added that the Japanese will have a hard time selling in
European markets and ``this way they can move into those markets as
American-made.''
   Pickens also said his problems with Koito Manufacturing Co., a
Japanese auto headlight maker, ``is symbolic of the current trade
relations between the United States and Japan.''
   Pickens, known for his often hostile raids on U.S. companies,
has been battling with the management of Koito for representation
on its board.
   He complained that despite a 26 percent stake in the company, he
has been denied a seat on the board, even though Toyota, the
Japanese carmaker, has three seats with only a 19 percent share of
the company.
   Pickens maintained that Koito is really a subsidiary of Toyota.
   He repeated his assertion that his purchase of Koito stock was
purely for investment.
   ``We would never do anything to damage the company,'' said
Pickens, denying that he planned a ``green mail'' campaign, in
which a corporate raider buys a company's stock in hopes the
company will buy the shares back at a higher price than is
generally available to other shareholders.

   Mexico has recieved replies from 42 percent
of its foreign creditor banks on a debt renegotiation plan, and 90
percent of them are opting to reduce principal and interest rather
than grant new loans, the official news agency Notimex said Monday.
   Notimex, quoting unidentified banking sources in New York, said
the banks hold $21.8 billion of the $52.7 billion in private debt
covered by the renegotiation agreement.
   The agreement, reached in July with a committee of 15 of the
creditor banks, gives banks three options. They can cut principal,
cut interest or grant new loans.
   Notimex said 53 percent of the banks who have informed the
creditor committee, which is headed by Citibank in New York, of
their decisions are opting to cut principal, 37 percent are cutting
interest and 10 percent will make new loans.
   The committee represents nearly 500 banks.
   The renegotiation agreement has been hailed by Mexican officials
as a major step toward resolving Mexico's foreign debt crisis.
Mexico owes a total of more than $107 billion to private and
government creditors. It is the second-largest foreign debt in the
developing world.

   The Holiday Corp. announced the formation

its casinos and hotels.
   In August, Holiday Corp. announced the sale of its Holiday Inns
motel chain in the United States to brewing giant Bass PLC of Great
Britian.
   Holiday Corp., which is based in Memphis, held on to its casino
operations, Harrah's, and its Embassy Suits, Hampton Inn and
Homewood Suites hotel brands and said a new subsidiary would be
established to manage them.
   ``The name Promus has its roots in the Latin word meaning `to
serve' or `to give,' which is in keeping with our intended
corporate culture,'' Michael D. Rose, chief executive officer of
Holiday Corp., said in a statement.
   Holiday's $2.2 billion deal with Bass PLC is expected to close
in January.
   The company's new subsidiary will be run by the parent
corporation's senior management, Holiday said.

   LTV, which is operating under bankruptcy court protection from
creditors, said its net income was $85.7 million, or 68 cents per
share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $1.24
billion, or $12.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.
   Revenue declined from $1.71 billion in last year's third quarter
to $1.51 billion, primarily due to the exclusion of revenue from
the company's steel bar division, which is being sold.
   Last year's results included a $1.34 billion charge to cover
future pension obligations. The charge is related to the company's
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Operating income dropped from $77.6 million last year to $37.4
million, as aircraft products posted a $27.1 million loss and steel
profits fell from $80.9 million to $60.6 million.
   ``LTV's steel business was stable, but produced results that
were lower than in 1988,'' said Chairman Raymond A. Hay. ``Our
aerospace and defense units continued to incur increased costs
associated with fixed-price contracts, but we have taken steps
during the past few months to control costs and improve long-term
performance.''
   For the first nine months of the year, net income totaled $192.6
million, or $1.50 per share, compared with a loss of $3.25 billion,
or $31.97 per share, last year, including the special pension
charge.
   Revenue declined from $5.65 billion last year to $4.78 billion.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Pacific Corp. said Monday that its
chairman, T. Marshall Hahn, delivered a letter to Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp. Chairman William R. Laidig urging the paper
corporations' leaders meet to discuss Georgia-Pacific's merger
proposal.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific submitted a $3.1 billion merger
bid Oct. 31, offering $58 a share for Great Northern Nekoosa stock.
   Hahn later invited top officers of Great Northern Nekoosa, based
in Norwalk, Conn., to meet with top Georgia-Pacific officials.
   ``I think it would be a constructive step and would assist you
in evaluating our proposal,'' his letter said. ``We believe our
proposal is an attractive one and that a negotiated, friendly
transaction between our companies would be in the best interests of
your shareholders, employees and other constituencies.''
   In Portland, Maine, on Monday, the $58-a-share tender offer by
Georgia-Pacific for Great Northern Nekoosa spawned another lawsuit
in U.S. District Court, alleging that Great Northern officers are
trying to preserve their jobs by planning to fight the takeover.
   The complaint by BTZ Inc., identified in the lawsuit only as an
Illinois corporation that owns Great Northern stock, alleges that
Great Northern's directors sought to entrench their positions by
adoption of a ``poison pill'' plan designed to thwart a takeover.
   The 26-page complaint makes allegations similar to those
contained in separate lawsuits filed last week by Georgia-Pacific
and a group of five Great Northern shareholders.
   The lawsuit, filed as a class action on behalf of other
shareholders, asks that anti-takeover provisions be stricken from
Great Northern's bylaws and that Maine's year-old anti-takeover law
be declared unconstitutional. Great Northern is incorporated in
Maine.
   Great Northern has declined to comment on the issues raised in
the lawsuits. The company has yet to respond to the tender offer.

   Congressional inaction on a bill raising the
federal debt ceiling forced the Treasury to postpone its weekly
bill auction Monday and threatened the government with its first
default in history.
   The Treasury had planned to offer $16 billion in three- and
six-month bills Monday, but postponed the sale ``because Congress
has not completed action on legislation to increase the statutory
debt limit.''
   The Treasury lost further borrowing authority Oct. 31 when the
debt limit reverted from $2.87 trillion to $2 trillion. Because it
already has reached the lower limit, the government faces default
on some of its debt as early as Thursday.
   Congressional leaders spent much of Monday behind closed doors,
looking to break the stalemate that has blocked passage of the
higher debt ceiling and a big deficit-reduction bill.
   ``We have decided to concentrate on extension of the debt
ceiling while we are looking at other issues,'' House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters. He said leaders are
hoping to pass a new debt ceiling in time for President Bush to
sign it on Wednesday.
   Foley indicated that one major issue to be resolved is whether
legislation repealing or scaling back catatstrophic health coverage
for retirees should be attached to the debt-ceiling bill or
considered as part of the deficit-reduction package.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said last week that if
Congress fails to increase the limit by Tuesday, ``the government
will run out of cash and default on Nov. 9'' when about $13.8
billion in Treasury bills mature.
   ``Each day that Congress fails to act, however, will cause
additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting
in higher interest costs to the taxpayer,'' Brady said in a speech
to Maryland bankers.
   ``To avoid these potential costs and the prospect of default,
immediate congressional action is imperative.''
   The House has passed a $3.1 trillion debt ceiling, but action
has been stalled in the Senate by Republican demands that it be
accompanied by enactment of a capital gains tax cut, a top priority
for President Bush.
   The White House abandoned that effort Thursday, and Democratic
and GOP Senate leaders were discussing legislation Monday to
increase the limit. However, any bill approved by the Senate likely
would differ from the House version and efforts to reach a
compromise would require additional time.
   Michael Basham, deputy assistant Treasury secretary, told
reporters last week that plans for $40 billion in additional
borrowing this week probably would have to be postponed if Congress
doesn't complete action on a new debt limit by Tuesday.
   These auctions include $10 billion in three-year notes Tuesday,
$10 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday and $10 billion in 30-year
bonds Thursday. In addition, the Treasury plans to sell $10 billion
in 36-day cash management bills Thursday.
   Lack of congressional action forced the Treasury last Wednesday
to suspend new sales of U.S. savings bonds and of special
securities for state and local governments.
   The special securities are temporary investment vehicles for
money those governments raise in the bond market. If the securities
are not available, state and local governments could be forced to
cancel planned bond sales, leading to disruption of the municipal
bond market.

   The Supreme Court on Monday removed the last
legal obstacle to carrying out a $2.5 billion settlement for
victims of the Dalkon Shield birth-control device.
   But compensatory payments may not begin until next spring, and
no one could say definitively how many of the nearly 100,000 women
with active claims will receive substantial payments.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, rejected a challenge by
some 650 women to the settlement reached out with A.H. Robins Co.,
manufacturer of the intrauterine device.
   Marketed in the early 1970s, the Dalkon Shield allegedly caused
infertility, spontaneous abortions, pelvic inflammation or, in some
cases, death.
   Sharon Lutz, a Detroit lawyer representing 18,000 of the women
who had sued Robins and who had urged the court to uphold the
settlement, said payments might start by late February or early
March.
   ``It's been a long, long struggle for a terrible, terrible
tragedy,'' she said, ``but today's great news marks the beginning
of the end.''
   Baltimore lawyer Michael Pretl, who also represented women who
alleged injuries, said payments may be delayed for several months
beyond the February target date.
   ``I don't think it's realistic to expect we'll have money
flowing before next spring,'' Pretl said, predicting that
individual women with serious injuries will receive payments
ranging from $25,000 to $250,000.
   Pretl said that many thousands of women with active claims may
get relatively little money for varying reasons. For example, they
may have used more than one brand of device, he said.
   And most women who will receive substantial awards likely will
have to pay one-third to their lawyers.
   Sales of the Dalkon Shield ended in 1974 but the product was not
actually recalled until 1984. A.H. Robins, based in Richmond, Va.,
created the $2.5 billion trust fund as part of its 1985
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law.
   The bankruptcy was sparked by thousands of lawsuits by women who
had used the device.
   Some 9,000 cases were settled before the bankruptcy declaration.
The range of payments made under those settlements are serving as a
model for a four-member committee that will decide the size of
individual awards.
   Appointed by U.S. District Judge Robert Merhige of Richmond, the
committee is chaired by Georgine Vairo of the Fordham University
law school in New York.
   The challenge acted on Monday contended that the settlement
wrongly bars future lawsuits against A.H. Robins officials and
others, and that $2.5 billion may not be enough money to compensate
all victims.
   Only Justice Byron R. White voted to grant full review to those
arguments.
   Under the bankruptcy reorganization plan, American Home Products
Corp., a New York-based business, has agreed to buy A.H. Robins and
fund the trust. That takeover is expected to become final Dec. 2.
   A.H. Robins stockholders will receive $700 million worth of
American Home stock _ making the acquisition price $3.2 billion.
   A.H. Robins spokesman Roscoe E. Puckett Jr. said, ``The company
is very pleased that the way finally has been cleared for
consummation of its reorganization plan.''
   In all, more than 300,000 women filed claims against A.H.
Robins, about 15,000 in lawsuits. About a dozen women saw their
cases go to trial and won multi-million-dollar awards, the highest
being $9.2 mllion. Such trials were barred after the bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Bradley Post, who won the record $9.2 million judgment in
Wichita, Kan., said about 100,000 claims were eliminated without
payment for one reason or another and as many as 80,000 settled
with payments of $300 to $750.
   But Pretl said women who believe they suffered injury by using a
Dalkon Shield who have not yet sued or been included in the case
may still have legal recourse.
   ``I would encourage people to continue to come forward if they
still have serious claims,'' he said, adding that such women may
share in a supplemental trust fund established by A.H. Robins'
insurer, Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.
   In other action Monday, the court:
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Illinois whether lawsuits
charging employers with violating a key federal anti-bias law must
be filed in federal _ not state _ courts.
   _Said it will decide in an Idaho case whether money given
directly to Mormon missionaries by church members is a deductible
donation under federal tax law.
   _Turned down the appeal of a Rhode Island woman threatened with
jail if she lets her boyfriend stay overnight while her children
are in the house.
   _Agreed to decide in a New York case whether a motorist who
pleads guilty to drunken driving and related traffic offenses in a
fatal car crash later may be prosecuted for homicide and assault.
   _Rejected the appeal of a woman who says she is Hank Williams
Sr.'s daughter and should share in the late country music legend's
copyright royalties.

<HEAD>Itel To Buy $15 Million in Ryder Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ryder System Inc. common stock rose more than 5
percent in a down market Monday amid speculation that the
transportation services company might be the target of a takeover
by Itel Corp., a Chicago-based transportation concern.
   Takeover rumors came after Itel filed notice that it plans to
acquire at least $15 million in Ryder common stock. The stock rose
$1.25 to close at $22.75.
   Analysts said the stock's rise was fueled by Itel's planned
purchase and occurred in a market in which the Dow Jones industrial
average closed down 47 points.
   ``It's not extraordinary but it's a pretty big jump in one day
given that the market is down significantly,'' said Bob Bernstein,
an analyst with Edward D. Jones in St. Louis.
   Ryder's board believes it is in the Miami-based company's best
long-term interest to continue as an independent company, said M.
Anthony Burns, Ryder's chairman, president and chief executive
officer.
   Itel spokeswoman Gloria Waber said she had no comment on the
filing, and Ryder had nothing to add to a short news release issued
Monday containing Burns' statement.
   But analysts said Itel's intended purchase of about 700,000 of
Ryder's 76 million outstanding shares could boost the stock price
and renew takeover talk.
   ``It's not buying the whole company by any means, but their
investment indicates interest and at a reasonable price,''
Bernstein said.
   The move by Itel, which has rail and shipping interests, could
be a precursor to additional Itel purchases of Ryder stock and make
other investors take notice, he said.
   Itel's stock closed down 37{ cents a share at $21.25 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Ryder's relatively low stock price may be driving Itel's
interest, said analyst Andrew Geller of Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia.
   ``Whenever it gets down to this level, this talk comes up
more,'' he said. ``But it's been talked about as a takeover
candidate for the last couple of years.''
   Ryder rents and leases trucks and vans to the commercial and
consumer markets, and provides aircraft maintenance and insurance
management services. It earned $79 million in the year ended Sept.
30 on revenue of $5.1 billion.
   Itel's divisions include rail-car leasing, container leasing and
warehousing. It also owns minority interests in Santa Fe Pacific
Corp., the parent of the Santa Fe railroad, and American President
Cos., a shipping and container operation based in Oakland, Calif.

   Colgate-Palmolive Co. will acquire
Vipont Pharmaceutical Inc. for about $94 million, enabling Colgate
to strengthen its oral hygiene product line, the companies
announced Monday.
   The merger agreement calls for the Fort Collins-based Vipont to
sell Colgate all of its outstanding common shares, for $14 per
share.
   Vipont also will spin off to its shareholders on Dec. 1 a total
of 65 percent of the outstanding shares of Vipont Research Labs
Inc., Vipont's research subsidiary. Part of the agreement calls for
Colgate to have exclusive rights to distribute Vipont Research's
periodontal treatment products. Colgate also will acquire a 10
percent equity interest in Vipont Research under the agreement,
according to the announcement by Vipont.
   ``Through Vipont's patented technology, Colgate can further
build its global leadership in oral care in a number of strategic
ways,'' said Reuben Mark, Colgate chairman and chief executive
officer. ``Specifically, Colgate has positioned itself as a leader
in anti-cavity, anti-tartar, and now with Vipont, anti-plaque
technology.''
   Colgate makes one of the world's top-selling toothpastes and
also sells a full line of toothbrushes, mouth rinses and
professional dental products. Vipont's anti-plaque toothpaste and
mouth rinse products are sold under the Viadent brand name.
   ``The Vipont technology is in the forefront of perio products,''
said Lawrence L. Frederick, president and chief executive officer
of Vipont Pharmaceutical. ``By becoming part of Colgate, this
technology will now receive the marketing and financial resources
to become truly global.''
   Closing of the tender offer hinges on Colgate receiving tenders
of at least 65 percent of the outstanding stock of Vipont
Pharmaceutical.
   Following the close of the tender offer, a Colgate subsidiary
will merge, subject to Vipont shareholder approval, into Vipont
Pharmaceutical, and Vipont Pharmaceutical will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Colgate.
   Vipont Pharmaceuticals reported $33.5 million in revenue and
$4.5 million in net income for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988.

<TEXT>
   After six days of negotiations raised hope for an
end to the Machinists union strike against Boeing Co., contract
talks collapsed over the weekend and no movement was evident Monday.
   ``To my knowledge there's nothing new, our thought still being
that the most responsible thing for the (union) to do is allow the
workers to vote on the contract offer,'' Boeing spokesman Harold
Carr said. ``We had an offer on the table and the union walked away
from it.''
   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond said no new talks were
scheduled, and he didn't anticipate any this week. Union spokesman
could not be reached for comment Monday.
   The strike, which began Oct. 4, moves into its 35th day Tuesday.
   The company's offer rejected by union members Oct. 3 included
annual pay raises of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, with
bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent
in the second.
   The revised offer on the table Saturday contained the same wage
increases with bonuses of 10 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent. The
additional bonus money was offset by lower cost-of-living
provisions and lower company contributions to some insurance
payments.
   Retirement benefits would have been increased across the board
in the revised offer, while other benefits would remain the same as
in the previous offer. Boeing also would have paid health premiums
for November, which striking workers now must pay or go without
coverage.
   The latest offer also would cut mandatory overtime from 200 to
144 hours per quarter and assured workers at least every third
weekend off. The previous offer called for 160 hours of mandatory
overtime and a maximum of three weekends in a row.
   The Machinists represent about 57,800 workers, including 43,300
in the local district lodge, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in
Portland, Ore., and a few hundred at scattered sites in California,
Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and other states.

   Kroger Co. said Monday that the grocery chain
is canceling plans to sell eight food processing plants because
potential buyers have failed to obtain the needed financing.
   Kroger said, however, that it might continue to pursue the sale
of one of the plants, the North Coast Bakery in Solon, Ohio.
   ``The general economic markets these days are such that it's
hard for companies to obtain financing to do potential deals,''
Kroger spokesman Paul Bernish said. ``We wanted to complete the
sales in this time of the year and since our buyers were not able
to arrange financing, we mutually agreed to call it quits.''
   Kroger, which owns supermarkets, convenience stores and food
processing plants in 32 states, announced plans last fall to sell
some assets as part of a $4.6 billion restructuring begun after two
unsuccessful takeover attempts against the company last year.
   The company said the eight plants, located in seven states, have
annual earnings of $50 million before taxes and interest.
   ``They're contributing to our cash flow, which is very important
to us in our highly leveraged situation,'' Bernish said.
   Kroger reported a $5.3 million loss for the third quarter of
1989, but said it was able to prepay $66 million in debt from the
company's restructuring plan.
   The eight plants Kroger took off the market are Delight Products
in Springfield, Tenn., Kenlake Foods in Murray, Ky., Pontiac Foods
of Pontiac, S.C., State Avenue in Cincinnati, Tara Foods in Albany,
Ga., K.B. Specialty Foods in Greensburg, Ind., Pace Dairy in
Rochester, Minn. and the North Coast Bakery in Solon.

   GTE Corp. said Monday it will close two
lighting plants in Massachusetts and close 17 warehouses nationwide
as part of a restructuring of its distribution system, resulting in
more than 800 layoffs.
   GTE said it will move its light bulb plant in Salem to a sister
plant in Pennsylvania and close its lighting fixture assembly plant
in Fall River.
   The closure of the 17 warehouses will result in the layoff of
about 260 employees over the next 18 months.
   Employees at the Loring Avenue plant in Salem, which makes
incandescent light bulbs, were told a consolidation plan will
result in the closure of the plant by mid 1991. The plant's
operations will be moved to a plant in St. Marys, Pa. The move will
result in layoffs of 555 people, the company said.
   The Fall River operation will be consolidated with the company's
North American fixtures plant in Toronto, company officials said,
resulting in the layoff of 73 workers.
   Peter Caleshu, vice president and director of manufacturing for
the company's U.S. Lighting division, said cheaper products from
foreign competition had forced the plant closures.
   The move of the Salem operation to Pennsylvania would allow GTE
to lower overhead costs and stay competitive, Caleshu said. Also,
shipping and utility costs are cheaper at the Pennsylvania plant,
and more operating space is available, he said.
   James Czifirik, the union business agent representing workers at
Salem, said the company put earnings before the interest of workers.
   ``We're making money here, so why close? The answer is they want
more profit margin for stockholders,'' he said.
   GTE said it will close warehouses in Buffalo, N.Y.; Charlotte,
N.C.; Cincinnati and Cleveland; Dearborn, Mich.; Denver; Pittsburgh
and Devon, Pa.; Fridley, Minn.; Hayward, Calif.; Hazelwood, Mo.;
Houston; New Orleans; Orlando, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; Springfield,
