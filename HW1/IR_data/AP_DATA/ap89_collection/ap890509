   Six sailors were killed and five injured
Tuesday when an intense fire erupted in the engine room of a Navy
supply ship heading home from a deployment supporting Persian Gulf
operations, the Pentagon said.
   Crewmen aboard the USS White Plains, a food stores ship, battled
the blaze for over an hour before bringing it under control,
officials said. The ship was in the South China Sea about 100 miles
east of Hong Kong at the time.
   The Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, said that the fire occurred
``in the main engine spaces.'' A Navy source said it apparently
involved a fuel leak in and around the ship's No. 3 boiler.
   The 581-foot White Plains is based at the Pacific island of Guam
and is crewed by a normal complement of 403 enlisted men and 25
officers.
   Anxious relatives of crew members gathered at the military
chapel on Guam Tuesday, awaiting word on the accident. Some wives
had just returned to Guam after visiting their husbands during a
port call in Hong Kong.
   The accident occurred three weeks after an explosion inside a
gun turret on the battleship Iowa left 47 sailors dead.
   Questions have been raised about whether the Iowa explosion was
due to faulty powder or human error, but officials have not yet
said what caused the accident. Howard, with a curt, one-word reply
of ``None,'' dismissed the idea the fire aboard the White Plains
might suggest problems with Navy training or equipment maintenance.
   In addition to the six dead, five other crewmen were injured. By
late Tuesday, the Navy had identified three of those killed and
four of the injured.
   The first four fatalities were identified as Boiler Technician
3rd Class Muoi Cao, 22, of Ventura, Calif.; Fireman Apprentice Todd
Allan Follis, 22, of Zuni, N.M.; Machinist Mate-Fireman Apprentice
Paul Dennis Novotny, 22, of Howells, Neb.; and Fireman Apprentice
Darryl D. Edwards, 20, Flossmor, Ill.
   Cao joined the Navy in September 1985 and had been aboard the
White Plains since August 1986. Follis joined the Navy in October
1987 and had been aboard the ship since July 1988. Novotny joined
the Navy in November 1987 and had been on the ship since November
1988.
   The Navy identified four of the injured as Damage Controlman 2nd
Class James Henry Britt, 24, of Nashville, Tenn.; Machinist Mate
3rd Class Keith Gerald Landry, 22, of Greenwell Springs, La.;
Boatswain's Mate 2nd Class Darryl Jerome Williams, 24, of
Birmingham, Ala., and Chief Boiler Technician Walter Rufus Greggs
Jr., 41, of Mobile, Ala.
   Howard and Navy spokesmen said the five injured suffered
primarily second-and third-degree burns and were airlifted to the
military hospital at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. A
spokeswoman there, Air Force Capt. Donna Eggleston, said they were
listed in stable condition.
   After the fire was extinguished, the Whte Plains was taken under
tow to Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines for repairs. A Navy
source said the ship wasn't expected to arrive at Subic until
Sunday.
   The Pentagon said it took 75 minutes to control and extinguish
the blaze. Military sources who demanded anonymity said the fire
grew so hot that sailors were limited to five-minute stints in
fighting the blaze.
   Howard said the fire erupted around 2 a.m. EDT, or 2 p.m. local
time. The White Plains and four other Navy ships were steaming
almost due east of Hong Kong after completing their port call
Monday and were about 100 miles from land at the time of the fire.
   According to one source, the fire occurred while the ship was
steaming at about 21 degrees, 58 minutes north latitude and 115
degrees, 37 minutes east longitude.
   The four other ships included the aircraft carrier
Constellation; the cruiser Fox; the frigate Ouellet, and the oiler
Sacramento. The Constellation battle group was steaming for home
after duty in the northern Arabian Sea supporting the naval task
force in the Persian Gulf.
   The bodies of the sailors killed in the fire were transferred to
the Constellation Tuesday, the Pentagon said, adding ``a
determination has not been made at this time as to the transfer of
the remains.''
   A Navy official who asked not to be identified said preliminary
information suggested the fire involved ``a fuel leak in the boiler
manifold intake on the No. 3 boiler.''
   The source said it was unclear at this point whether the failure
involved human error or an equipment failure. Although 20 years
old, Navy records do not indicate any past serious problems aboard
the White Plains.
   According to the Navy, the White Plains is 581 feet long, 79
feet wide and displaces about 16,000 tons when fully loaded.
   The ship is said to be capable of steaming at 20 knots and is
powered by three boilers which drive steam turbines. The power
plant, which turns a single propeller, is said to be capable of
developing 22,000 shaft horsepower.
   The ship was constructed by the National Steel and Shipbuilding
Co. of San Diego, Calif., and commissioned into active service on
Nov. 23, 1968.

<BYLINE>What Did Charles Bronson Do Before Acting? ^By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What was Hollywood's longest screen kiss? Where
did Bette Davis get her first name? What movie's star was dead
before shooting began?
   The truly knowledgeable will know the answers:
   _Three minutes, 5 seconds between Regis Toomey and Jane Wyman,
Ronald Reagan's first wife, in the 1940 film, ``You're In the Army
Now.''
   _``La Cousine Bette'' by Honore de Balzac.
   _``The Trail of the Pink Panther,'' which included unused takes
from the late Peter Sellers' appearances in previous Pink Panther
movies.
   The less informed can turn to ``Movie Clips,'' a compilation of
trivia published last month by Guinness Books and due out in New
York in November from Sterling Publishing.
   Its author, Patrick Robertson, says he has been a fan of the
silver screen since 1943 when, at age 3, he saw his first film,
``For Me and My Gal'' with Judy Garland.
   He can't remember phone numbers or his car registration, but his
memory for movies is ``pretty encyclopedic,'' he says. A civil
servant in the government bonds division of the Department for
National Savings, he has been writing about movies since 1974.
   His latest work revises his 1985 ``Guinness Book of Almost
Everything You Never Needed To Know About the Movies.''
   Robertson's entries include the likes of ``What They Did
Before,'' a compilation of stars' erstwhile careers (Charles
Bronson was a Pennsylvania coal miner) and ``Who Married Whom,'' a
rundown of interstellar marriages, with 74 percent ending in
divorce.
   He relies on two major sources: the information department of
the British Film Institute in London and the 24-volume compendium
of reviews from 1907-1984 published by Variety, the entertainment
industry newspaper.
   Thus, he informs readers that Rex Harrison has a glass eye;
Sophia Loren wrote a cookbook titled ``In the Kitchen With Love'';
Texas' name has appeared in 104 movie titles; and Dustin Hoffman
aged the most in a single film, from 17 to 121 in ``Little Big
Man.''
   The book lists actors who have written books, served prison
sentences, never married, married famous non-actors, played
themselves, played God. It lists those who faked their birthdates,
played the same role twice, and played in films shot entirely
aboard trains.
   Under the heading ``The only film seen by less people than
appeared in it,'' Robertson lists ``Kohlberg,'' a Nazi epic
released in January 1945 when few Berlin cinemas were operating.
The cast of 187,000 included whole army divisions diverted from
battle to be extras.
   Robertson said he was particularly proud of his entry, ``Unusual
Casts,'' which enumerates those feature films with a difference _
two, for example, with a cast made up entirely of Maoris, a people
native to New Zealand.
   Under ``Blunders,'' he lists TV antennas in ``The Wrong Box,''
set in Victorian London; an electricity pole in ``Gone With the
Wind''; a 50-star American flag in a scene from ``The Godfather''
set in 1945. Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959.
   Robertson says he already has a candidate for that section of
his next edition: In ``The Accused,'' he said, Jodie Foster is
shown in white shoes as she flees rapists, but when the scene is
shown in flashback, her shoes are black.

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One day last month, Dr.
Habis Wahadi and other emergency room staff at the Ahli Arab
Hospital said they treated 35 Palestinians for gunshot wounds from
confrontations with Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip.
   But when Wahadi turned on his TV that night, Israeli news
reports quoted the army as saying only 20 people were wounded in
clashes both in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
   ``It obviously doesn't compute,'' Wahadi said, looking at the
hospital's log book. ``And the difference seems to be getting
bigger every day.''
   The army blames some of the discrepancy on difficulties in
gathering data, especially on days when casualties occur in
far-flung rural villages.
   But military officials also allege that Arab-run hospitals and
human rights groups have begun exaggerating figures to try to
retain world interest as the uprising begins its 18th month.
   ``The reason you now see a greater number of wounded is because
of a deliberate attempt by Palestinians to overload the list,''
said Col. Raanan Gissin, the army's deputy spokesman.
   He denied there has been a major increase in casualties and
added: ``They have found it is easier to keep their issue alive by
providing large numbers of wounded ... especially in light of
political moves in the United States regarding the PLO.''
   The latest example of a wide discrepancy in figures came
Saturday, when U.N. officials reported 158 people wounded by army
gunfire in widespread clashes in the Gaza Strip, as well as three
deaths. The army said 77 were wounded and two killed.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which supervises aid for
Palestinian refugees, said casualties reached a record 405 Gaza
residents wounded by Israeli gunfire in April, 11 of whom died. The
previous monthly high was 248 in January.
   In contrast, the army's statistics for April, available only for
the first 27 days, show just 198 Gazans wounded.
   ``I won't deny that there is some misreporting,'' said a U.N.
medical officer who asked not to be identified.
   He recounted the case of a Palestinian woman who first told
doctors she was beaten by army soldiers, then tearfully confessed
her husband had battered her.
   ``Such cases are rare,'' the U.N. doctor said. ``In cases of
gunshot wounds, we're almost 100 percent sure about cause and
effect because we know what kind of ammunition the army has _
rubber bullets, plastic bullets, M-16 rounds.''
   On one issue there is no disagreement: many of the wounded
Palestinians are giving false names to the hospitals.
   One Gaza youth, who admitted falsifying his name when he sought
treatment for a bullet in the leg, said he feared arrest. ``Look,
if I give my real name, they'll report it to the army,'' he said on
condition of anonymity. ``The army will come looking for me because
they figure if I've been shot, I was throwing stones. I don't
intend to go to jail.''
   The false reporting of names prompted the army's regional
commander, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, to suggest Arab doctors
were padding hospital records with names drawn at random from
telephone books.
   ``It just isn't true,'' Wahadi said. ``A gunshot wound is a
gunshot wound, whether the boy gives his name as Mohammed or
Khaled.''
   A colleague, who asked not to be identified, said fear of arrest
actually led to under-reporting of Palestinian casualties. ``We
know of some shebab (youths) who go quietly to local doctors rather
than risk registering at hospitals,'' he said.
   One incentive for Palestinians to say they are wounded is that
the PLO pays compensation for uprising victims.
   Arab sources said that payments of up to $500 were deposited in
Jordan bank accounts for those who could prove uprising injuries.
The families of people killed by army gunfire collect about double
that amount, the sources said.
   Still, the biggest statistical problems stem from disagreement
over whom to count in fatality tolls and what constitutes a wounded
person.
   The army counts only deaths it can confirm were caused by
military gunfire, beatings or other actions. Its total through
April 27 was 352 Palestinians killed.
   But the Jerusalem-based Israeli Information Center for Human
Rights in the Occupied Territories counts 423 Palestinians dead
through April.
   The group, set up by liberal Israelis to monitor the uprising,
includes death reports from hospitals the army says it cannot
confirm because bodies were taken for burial before autopsy. It
also includes 18 killings blamed on Israeli civilians but, like the
army, excludes Arab assassinations of Palestinians suspected of
collaborating with Israel.
   The Associated Press count was 456 at the end of April,
including 42 collaborators and the deaths caused by Israeli
settlers.
   The disparity in injury tallies is even greater.
   The army counts those Palestinians who require hospitalization
as a result of army action.
   According to the army's latest statistics, 5,667 Palestinians
were wounded in the past 17 months.
   The U.N. agency uses a broader definition that includes all
people who seek medical treatment, including out-patient care for
tear-gas inhalation or first aid for bruises from beatings or
rubber bullets.
   According to U.N. figures, nearly 25,000 Palestinians were
injured through April 15. The total includes 4,582 wounded by
gunfire.

<TEXT>
   At midnight, the priest lighted a sacred
fire and called for the bride and groom.
   The bride was nursing at her mother's breast. The bleary-eyed
groom, burdened with a huge turban, a sword and marigold garlands,
was yawning.
   Sonu, the 2-year-old bride, and Arjun, the 8-year-old groom,
were among an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 children who were married
across India's Rajasthan state during the weekend in violation of a
law banning child marriage.
   The marriages are held on the first and second days of the full
moon cycle in the month of May when village elders, in keeping with
a centuries-old tradition, study the stars and predict rain _ the
source of life in a state where 80 percent of the land is desert.
   These auspicious days also are celebrated as a weekend harvest
festival for the year's first maize and lentil crops.
   Such weddings normally are kept secret from outsiders, lest the
parents be prosecuted for marrying their children so young. If
convicted, an offender can be jailed for three months, fined about
$330 or both.
   But there is no record of a single conviction in Rajasthan,
which lies between New Delhi and Bombay. Local journalists and
Naryan Lal Tak, a tourist guide who is writing a book on Rajasthan
weddings, said they knew of only two cases in which complaints were
filed, but no one was charged.
   ``I have nothing to fear. I am just following what my
forefathers did,'' said Sonu's father, Narayan Prajapati. His four
other children, none older than 14, also are married.
   ``I was married when I was just six years old and my wife only
one year old,'' said Prajapati.
   ``For me, it is but natural that my children should get married
according to our tradition,'' said Prajapati, who earns $4 a day
working as a carpenter in Vorawas, 19 miles east of the ancient
city of Jodhpur where India's famed Rajput, or warrior, clan
thwarted the might of 16th century Mogul invaders.
   A 1978 Indian law set the legal marriage age at 18 for women and
21 for men, but enforcement has been limited _ especially in
Rajasthan, where Hindu traditions are deeply rooted. Many of the
child marriages take place in areas where there are few law
enforcement officers and where disruption of custom could trigger
violence.
   In and around Vorawas, 17 other marriages were conducted in
recent days. None of the brides was older than 14.
   ``I am getting four of my daughters married,'' said Udham Singh,
the head of the neighboring village of Gujrabas.
   The youngest of his four daughters was 3-year-old Jamuna, who
was playing hopscotch with older children in the courtyard of the
family's mud-plastered house.
   ``If you travel through Rajasthan today you will find (child)
marriages being held everywhere,'' said Tak, the tourist guide.
   ``By conservative estimate at least 40,000 to 50,000 marriages
are solemnized in the state during these days,'' he added.
   ``The parents of the bride think that they are doing what they
should do,'' Tak said. ``They do not understand, or do not care to
understand, all the nice legal things.''
   ``They believe that they are doing the right thing and a
marriage should be a grand marriage,'' he said.
   That was apparent at Vorawas.
   As Sonu and Arjun fought sleep amid heat from the sacred fire
and loud songs of the village women, the elders held their own
rite: the opium ceremony.
   The oldest man made a watery paste of opium, which he offered to
all.
   ``You are required to drink it from his hand and then bless the
newly wedded couple,'' said a member of the group. ``When he offers
you the opium, he is the giver. In return you can give your
blessings.''
   But the blessings must accompany some money, another man
advised. ``Just 51 rupees (about $3.30),'' he whispered.
   The groom is required to take an oath in front of a fire that
personifies the fire god, Agni Devta. Then the bride and the groom
walk seven times around the flames.
   Hindus believe the fire god is the most powerful after the holy
trinity of Shiva the destroyer, Vishnu the protector and Brahma the
creator.
   ``If either of them budge from the vow of being man and wife he
or she will face the anger of the fire god,'' said Ratan Lal, a
wedding guest.
   ``For you this may appear terrible, but for us it is natural,''
Tak said. ``In villages we wonder why you marry at old age in the
cities.''

<HEAD>Two Young Whites Convicted Of Fatal Stoning Of Black Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two young white men have been
convicted of murdering an 8-year-old black boy who was struck in
the skull by a paving stone hurled from the back of a
four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   According to testimony, the young men were part of a group of
high school students who skipped classes on Oct. 12, 1987 and who
decided to throw stones at pedestrians while on their way back from
a picnic grounds where they had been drinking.
   Ronnie Pitso, 8, died of brain injuries after he was struck by a
paving stone hurled by Shane Mitchell, now 18, according to
Monday's judgment in Johannesburg Supreme Court.
   Timothy Beddingfield, now 20, also was convicted of murder on
the grounds that he knew the stone was about to be thrown and did
nothing to stop Mitchell.
   Sentencing was scheduled for May 22.
   A murder conviction can carry the death penalty in South Africa,
but that will not happen in this case because the court ruled that
there were extenuating circumstances, including the defendants' age.

   ABC shows won two of 20 citations from
Action for Children's Television, an advocacy group that honored
children's shows for creative excellence.
   ACT, in keeping with its theme of using television to encourage
children to read, gave its ``Stop, Look &amp; Listen'' award to ``Daddy
Can't Read,'' an ABC Afterschool special that confronted adult
illiteracy ``in a solution-oriented story for children and
families,'' the 10,000-member organization said.
   ``Creative excellence in children's TV is still the exception to
the rule of mediocrity,'' said Peggy Charren, who founded the
organization in 1968. ``But these ACT award-winners demonstrate
that a concern for the TV needs of young audiences can result in
programs that help families learn, laugh, think and care.''
   ABC on Monday also won a commercial broadcast award for ``The
New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,'' which Charren said was ``an
imaginative extension of the Pooh stories ... preserving the
essence of the original characters.''
   Boston's WNEV also received a commercial broadcast award for
``Ready to Go!,'' a morning program that combines news, weather and
games for children.
   Other winning programs that were based on children's literature
include ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,'' produced by Sony Video
Software, and Lancit Media's ``Ramona.''

<HEAD>At Beirut Restaurants, It's B.Y.O.B. _ Bring Your Own Bread</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dining out in Beirut during lulls in the
artillery battles between Christians and Moslems is pretty much a
do-it-yourself affair these days.
   Some restaurants that open for a few hours between bombardments
now ask customers to bring their own bread.
   And if they've got anything else to vary the diet of canned
food, which most people live on for days on end while huddled in
their bunkers, they can bring that along as well.
   The menus at restaurants like Socrates and Sofar, which always
were packed in the days when Beirut was the playground of the
Middle East, are pretty plain, mainly ``homemade dishes'' of stew
and rice.
   Only a few restaurants open during the lulls. The seaside fish
restraurants along the corniche, which in quieter times are usually
packed, remain closed.
   The Syrians have positioned artillery and rocket launchers on
the corniche to fire across the bay into the Christian enclave,
which makes the area a target for retaliatory shellfire.
   Flour, like sugar, water and electricity, is in short supply. No
one is starving, but the belt-tightening has affected everyone.
   The flour shortage has spawned ``bread mafias'' _ people who buy
up as much flour as they can when it's available, then sell bread
at high prices.
   A crowd of about 50 people, yelling and pushing, were seen
around a car in the street recently in the Hamra district of Moslem
west Beirut.
   It looked like an accident, but it was actually a man selling
the flat loaves of pita bread. The carload sold out in minutes,
despite the fact that it was four times the price before the latest
round of fighting erupted March 8.
   Moslem militiamen in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in east
Lebanon last week hijacked three truckloads of flour, totalling
about 75 tons, heading for Beirut.

   The electricity shortages also have worsened the plight of the
Lebanese.
   A European woman said she needed a whole week to watch the Peter
Sellers movie, ``Being There'' because of the electricity rationing.
   The woman, who has lived in Beirut for a year, began watching
the two-hour videocassette one night last week. But the power,
rationed to a random two hours a day, went off after only a few
minutes.
   ``I thought I'd finish it the next day,'' said the woman, who
asked that her name not be used. ``I had no idea what time our turn
for electricity was.
   ``But at 5:55 a.m. the lights suddenly came on in my apartment.
I wasn't wildly excited about getting up that early, but I was
anxious to finish the film even though I could hardly open my eyes.
   ``I got up, made a strong cup of coffee and was really getting
into the movie when, just like that, the electricity went off 10
minutes later. It didn't come back all that day.
   ``Over the next days, the electricity came on when I was out so
I couldn't watch the film. A friend who has a generator at home
said I could finish it at his place but the videocassette got stuck
in the player.''
   It took her three days to get it it out. But she finally did get
to see the movie all the way to the end.

   Among the nearly 300 people killed since March 8 were four
members of the Itani family, who are Sunni Moslem. They died when a
Christian 155mm shell hit their home in west Beirut.
   Ten other members of the family were wounded, dragged from the
rubble by civil defense rescue teams. The rescuers frequently had
to run for cover as more shells exploded around them in the
indiscriminate barrage.
   That's probably why they didn't notice the family's baby _
7-month-old Zeina _ buried under the debris. Her mother, Rana, was
among the dead.
   Several hours later, the baby's wounded relatives being treated
at the American University Hospital realized she was not accounted
for and went back to their wrecked home to find her.
   They clawed through the jagged concrete slabs until they found
Zeina, who was not injured.

   Not everyone curses the bombardments.
   Christian shells blew down an outside wall of one of the
cellblocks in the gendarmerie prison in Moslem west Beirut's Verdun
district on one recent night.
   The guards were in underground bunkers, and 53 of the prisoners,
serving sentences for theft and drug trafficking, escaped.
   Later, 33 were rounded up; the other 20 are still at large.

<HEAD>Earth's Thin Rhizosphere Layer as Mysterious to Scientists as Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earth's thin layer where plant roots seek
water and nourishment is a world as mysterious as the distant
planets, says Agriculture Department scientist Richard W. Zobel.
   It is this layer, or rhizosphere, that determines what kind of
crops can be grown, if any, and where so many of the Earth's people
can live well.
   Zobel, a plant geneticist, said Monday that the rhizosphere is a
teeming world of minerals, gases, water and life forms _ insects,
earthworms, microscopic nematode worms, a host of microorganisms,
living and dead plant roots, and the chemicals they exude.
   ``We don't even begin to thoroughly understand it, although
we're slowly pulling it together,'' he said. ``I'd say our
knowledge of the area six inches to two feet below the soil's
surface is comparable to our knowledge of outer space right now.''
   Zobel works for the department's Agricultural Research Service
at its Ithaca, N.Y., laboratory.
   One reason for lack of knowledge about the world at our feet is
that ``only recently have we had the tools to study it, and they're
still not up to the job,'' he said. ``Soil physics and chemistry,
plant biology and physiology, entomology and microbiology all
provide tools, but none of them is designed to work with more than
a single microorganism or a single plant at a time.''
   And when a scientist has to ``put all these elements together
and try to study them, it's tough,'' Zobel said. ``We need to learn
how microorganisms interact with the plant, and with each other.
Plant roots aren't all the same; they're functionally different and
have different growth patterns. Some die back every two weeks,
continually feeding the microorganisms in the soil.''
   Zobel spoke Monday at an annual symposium held by the agency at
Beltsville, Md. His remarks were included in reports issued by the
department.
   Topics in the four-day conference include genetic engineering
and some of the new technologies for investigating the Earth's root
zone.
   One of scientists' goals is to find ways to grow crops where
they won't grow now because the soil is too wet, dry or salty, or
has trace elements such as aluminum that can inhibit growth.
   ``But we don't have the genetic information to manipulate the
plants the way we need to do,'' Zobel said. ``A lot of that
information is below the surface of the soil. I think we're on the
edge of a major revolution here, and can begin to get handles on
these things.''
   Zobel said when scientists gain understanding of the
rhizosphere, ``a whole multitude of things'' will fall into place.
   ``For example, we could reduce chemical use on crops by knowing
what biological elements in the soil will do the same thing,'' he
said. ``That affects groundwater quality since you reduce the
chances of chemicals moving into the water.''
   And if scientists could increase the ability of microorganisms
to take nitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into forms that
plants can use, it could mean a major reduction in fertilizer use.
   ``We're only beginning to understand that a plant has genes that
control nitrogen fixation as well as the bacteria do, so we can
manipulate the plant end, too,'' Zobel said. ``That's an awful lot
of information still to be discovered.''

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has
named on-campus representatives to represent the Agriculture
Department at 17 historically black universities.
   The plan first announced in December will create a USDA liaison
office at each of the schools, which are collectively known as 1890
institutions because of new land-grant college legislation that
year.
   Yeutter said Monday the top priority for the USDA
representatives, all currently employed by the department in other
capacities, will be to work with state and local department
officials in an outreach effort to recruit minorities into
agricultural and forestry studies at the schools.
   The campus officials also will provide guidance and teaching
assistance, help develop curriculums, and recruit and counsel
students on USDA job opportunities and other agricultural careers,
he said. They also will provide some assistance to small farmers.
   More than 400 USDA employees applied for the 17 positions,
Yeutter said. All of the new representatives are scheduled to be on
the job by mid-June.

<HEAD>Monsanto Receives Permission to Field Test Genetically Altered Soybean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monsanto Agricultural Co. of St. Louis, Mo.,
has been given permission by the Agriculture Department to conduct
the first field testing of a genetically altered soybean variety.
   The new variety, which contains a petunia gene, is expected to
be unaffected by glyphosate, a weedkiller sold by Monsanto under
the trade name Roundup. Testing begins this month and will continue
through the summer at sites in Jerseyville, Ill.; Whiteville,
Tenn.; and Stuttgart, Ark.
   ``Glyphosate tolerance in soybeans would offer new production
possibilities to American farmers,'' James W. Glosser,
administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, said Monday. ``A single herbicide could be used
without fear of damaging the crop, rather than the mixtures and
multiple applications now necessary.''
   Glosser said the agency has evaluated the scientific data and
methods to be used in the field tests and found them to be ``well
designed and environmentally safe.''
   Monsanto scientists engineered the new variety by transferring a
petunia gene to soybeans. Greenhouse studies showed the new soybean
to be tolerant of glyphosate, and now scientists want to test it
under field conditions.
   The USDA also has issued permits to a number of companies for
field testing of some other genetically altered crops, including
cotton and tomatoes, to see if they are resistant to weedkilling
chemicals.

<HEAD>ABC Pulls the Plug on `Moonlighting' After Four Seasons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sizzle in ``Moonlighting'' has fizzled,
forcing ABC to cancel its once popular hit after the
tongue-in-cheek detective series landed in the ratings basement.
   ``Moonlighting,'' an instant hit for ABC when it debuted four
years ago with the zany antics of detectives David Addison and
Maddie Hayes, will have its last original episode broadcast this
Sunday, the network said Monday.
   The show made a star of Bruce Willis, who played the
free-spirited David, and was the comeback vehicle for Cybill
Shepherd as the straight-laced Maddie. The bickering romance
between the mismatched couple sparked sexual electricity.
   ``TV, by its very nature, is cyclical and it would be foolish to
expect `Moonlighting' to continue indefinitely,'' Willis said
Monday.
   ``When the show was at its height, it was very much like playing
a brand new song that had never been played before,'' he said.
``Some people might not have liked the song, we may not have always
played it exactly to fit people's taste, but when we were `on,' we
hit some notes that will never be played again.''
   Producer-creator Glenn Caron's witty dialogue and sometimes
daring stories also were credited with wooing the audience. He left
the show after a creative dispute with Miss Shepherd.
   In recent years, the show also suffered production problems. It
began as one of the brightest spots on Tuesday night, but this
season was pulled from the schedule and returned on Sunday nights.
It was the seventh lowest-rated show in last week's A.C. Nielsen
Co. ratings.
   ``We feel the show has reached a creative conclusion and that
this is the appropriate time to end the series,'' ABC's statement
said. ``We are quite proud of the innovation which `Moonlighting'
brought to television during the past four years.''
   Caron spofed the film noir of the 1940s with a black and white
episode called ``The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice.'' Another
episode was a sendup of Shakespeare's ``Taming of the Shrew.''
   The production schedule of ``Moonlighting'' was at best chaotic.
Caron often didn't complete a script before filming started. The
show fell behind schedule and frequently went into reruns.
   The turning point came when Miss Shepherd became pregnant. When
the producers also chose to have Maddie become pregnant, the show
went into a creative decline. An old flame showed up for a
whirlwind romance. She also finally went to bed with David, and
David, as well as the audience, was left to guess who the father
was.
   The series also was forced to rely heavily on its secondary
stars, Allyce Beasley and Curtis Armstrong, during Miss Shepherd's
absence. When she returned, the audience was further alienated by
Maddie's quickie marriage to a man she met on a train. The marriage
was later annulled and in this season's first episode, Maddie had a
miscarriage.
   ``It's a sad time for all of us,'' said executive producer Jay
Daniel, who succeeded Caron. ``We've all loved doing the show. On
the wrap shot I told the crew, when they write the book on
`Moonlighting' it will begin: `It was the best of times, the worst
of times.'''

<HEAD>Decontrol Push Slows in Senate; Approval Still Seen Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional drive to end 35 years of
federal controls on natural gas prices has hit a rough patch in the
Senate, but supporters and even some opponents predict the measure
will win final approval.
   A nearly identical decontrol bill gained easy approval by the
House last month.
   At a Senate Energy Committee hearing Monday, some members raised
questions about the effects of decontrol on natural gas prices and
supplies, but a majority hailed the legislation as a key to
improving national energy supplies.
   ``Passage of this legislation will help ensure ... that natural
gas can live up to its potential as a clean-burning, abundant and
domestically available fuel for America's future,'' said Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston, D.-La., the bill's sponsor.
   The legislation would complete a price decontrol process that
began in 1978 with the Natural Gas Policy Act, which removed price
limits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen
categories of gas, each with a ceiling price.
   About one-third of U.S. natural gas currently is subject to
federal price controls. Because most of the controlled gas is
selling at prices below the federal ceilings, the lifting of
controls is not expected to have much short-term effect.
   Looming over the decontrol debate is a growing consensus among
experts that the industry's failure over the past two decades to
fully replace its production with new discoveries will lead to a
supply squeeze and price jump in the 1990s.
   The natural gas trade organizations' main argument in favor of
decontrol is that it would help stimulate more drilling, thus
averting a crisis. But critics say that argument is weakened by
uncertainty about decontrol's effects on prices. If prices don't
rise, exploration generally would not be expected to increase.
   J. Allen Wampler, an assistant energy secretary, told Monday's
hearing that for at least the next year natural gas prices are more
likely to fall than rise, even if controls were ended.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, a critic of past efforts to deregulate
natural gas, said the proposal would give the major gas producers
freedom to raise prices without improving the nation's long-term
supply outlook.
   ``We know that big oil ripped us off on the gasoline price
hikes, and now we are opening up yet another avenue for them to
line their pockets at consumers' expense,'' the Ohio Democrat said.
He noted that Amoco Oil Co. is now the nation's largest natural gas
producer, and that other oil giants are close behind.
   A committee vote on the bill is not expected before mid-month.
Despite the issues raised at the hearing, eventual passage by the
full Senate is expected.
   ``It's likely it'll go through,'' Edwin Rothschild, a vocal
opponent, said after the hearing. He is assistant director of the
Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition, which has joined with other
consumer organizations in trying to kill the bill.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said that while he was not opposed in
principle to ending the price controls, he would not support
Johnston's bill until the committee agreed to an amendment to
redress what he called a ``serious injustice'' in his state.
   Bumpers said many Arkansas landowners who signed royalty
contracts with natural gas producers years ago were shortchanged by
fine print in the contracts that paid them far less than the going
rate. He said he would try to stop the bill from leaving the
committee until the contract problem was corrected.
   Also, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said he would try to stall the
bill until he received explicit assurances that decontrol would not
hurt the federally subsidized Great Plains project near Beulah,
N.D., that makes natural gas from coal.
   The ending of federal controls on natural gas prices is one of
the Bush adminstration's top energy priorities.

   Adult cocaine abusers told interviewers
they averaged nearly seven years of use without drug-related
problems, a ``honeymoon period'' that might undercut warnings to
adolescents about the drug, a researcher says.
   ``For some, it may not be helpful to say, `coke is going to get
you,' when they see adults day after day who've been using cocaine
for years who aren't in trouble yet,'' said psychiatrist Anne Kolar.
   But her study also found evidence that young people reach their
first negative experience with cocaine sooner. If further research
bears that out, publicizing it may make warnings to adolescents
seem more credible, she said.
   The study by Kolar and colleagues at the Addiction Research
Center in Baltimore was presented Monday at the American
Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.
   The information came from confidential interviews with 20
adolescents, ages 14 to 21, and 90 adults, ages 26 to 53, who were
being treated for cocaine abuse. Kolar cautioned the ``honeymoon
perod'' data was based on a small sample.
   The adults reported their first cocaine use at about age 22.
Eighty-eight percent said they had experienced at least one
negative consequence of their cocaine use, other than addiction,
before entering treatment. On average the first problem appeared
after 6.6 years of use.
   The most common problem was a disturbing loss of touch with what
was going on around them, reported by 43 percent, and first
occurring an average of about five years after first use.
   Overdosing was reported by 28 percent at an average of about
nine years; and depression or paranoid thinking by 18 percent with
averages of 10 years and 13 years, respectively.
   Doing violence to others was reported by 18 percent with an
average of five years, and hurting oneself by 10 percent after
seven years. Other problems were reported by 18 percent with an
eight-year average.
   Overall, the adults averaged 6.6 years before the first negative
consequence of cocaine use, researchers said.
   In contrast, the youths averaged far shorter intervals before
the first negative consequence, with only about a year before first
overdose, violence to others or disturbing loss of touch with what
was going on around them, for example.
   Perhaps the difference stems from an increased vulnerability of
their developing brains, Kolar said.
   But the concern is they may see adult users who appear not to
have drug-related problems, she said.
   Kolar said she suspects that the recent popularity of a powerful
form of cocaine called crack may shorten the ``honeymoon period''
for adults.
   Apart from that, efforts to dissuade cocaine use might do well
to copy anti-smoking campaigns that made tobacco socially
unacceptable, rather than simply warning about dangers, she said.
   Frederick Goodwin, administrator of the federal Alcohol, Drug
and Mental Health Administration, said Monday he believes warnings
can remain part of a credible anti-cocaine campaign.
   The idea is that using cocaine is like playing Russian roulette,
so that one person's experience does not mean another person's will
be the same, he said.
   He also said the ``honeymoon period'' with inhaled cocaine is
quite variable, and tends to be shorter in people with a family
history of alcoholism.
   Goodwin said he was not familiar with Kolar's study, but drug
users may not give an accurate picture of how drug use affected
their lives. Using other indicators such as interviews with spouses
would be helpful, he said.

   A federal judge threw out the Department of
Veterans Affairs' rules on Agent Orange health benefits, and
ordered the government to reconsider claims by more than 31,000
veterans.
   In a decision made public Monday, U.S. District Judge Thelton
Henderson said the agency wrongly required proof that Agent Orange
causes various diseases in denying most claims for benefits related
to the herbicide.
   Henderson, ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of
Agent Orange claimants, said the agency formerly known as the
Veterans Administration failed to give veterans the benefit of the
doubt.
   ``These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another,
sharply tipped the scales against veteran claimants,'' Henderson
said.
   Henderson struck down regulations denying Agent Orange
service-connected benefits for cancers and all other diseases
except chloracne, a non-fatal skin condtion. He also ordered the
agency to reopen all claims denied under those rules.
   ``This is a major victory with far-reaching implications,'' Mary
Stout, president of the 35,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America,
said in a statement.
   ``The ruling validates what Vietnam veterans have been saying
for years, that the VA has failed to give Agent Orange victims a
fair hearing,'' she said. ``I am optimistic that Congress will now
act quickly to resolve this most painful legacy of the Vietnam
War.''
   The government is expected to appeal the decision. The VA was
represented by the Justice Department.
   Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown declined to comment on Henderson's
ruling, saying department lawyers had not yet seen it. She said the
department would review the ruling before deciding its next step.
   Agent Orange, whose toxic ingredient is dioxin, was used as a
defoliant by the United States in Vietnam. Its health effects are
sharply disputed.
   The VA, relying on a review by an 11-member scientific
committee, ruled in 1985 that only chloracne could be considered a
service-connected effect of exposure to Agent Orange.
   Henderson rejected a challenge by the veterans' group to the
scientific committee's review of studies on Agent Orange's effects.
But the judge said the standards the VA used in making its rules
violated a 1984 federal law that was supposed to help Vietnam
veterans get health benefits due them.
   Henderson said the VA improperly required proof of a
cause-and-effect relationship between the herbicide and a disease
for which benefits would be granted. Instead, he said, the agency
should have required only that statistics show a significant
correlation between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an
``increased risk of incidence.''
   The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but
comments by members of Congress involved in passing the law showed
they opposed an overly stringent standard and felt cause-and-effect
proof was unnecessary, Henderson said.
   The judge noted that the VA had relied on statistical
relationships, without requiring proof of the cause, in granting
benefits to veterans who were amputees and developed heart disease.
Congress did the same thing in granting benefits to former
prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, Henderson said.
   The judge found a second error in the VA's refusal to apply to
its Agent Orange regulations the same ``benefit-of-the-doubt''
policy it uses for review of individual benefit cases, which favors
the veteran in close questions.
   Although the law's language is unclear, its ``remedial purpose''
favors a lenient standard, Henderson said. Noting that veterans
would be entitled to a favorable standard if they made individual
claims, he said Congress would not have intended to put them in a
worse position through collective regulation.
   Vietnam Veterans of America spokesman Barry Kasinitz said the
group will again sponsor Agent Orange legislation.
   The measure would require Agent Orange benefits for two kinds of
cancer _ soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma _ and to
establish a new scientific panel independent of the VA to study the
herbicide's health effects. The Senate passed a similar bill last
year, but it died in the House, Kasinitz said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
will ask Mikhail S. Gorbachev for help in forging peace in the
Middle East if the Soviet leader proves to be sincere about global
cooperation, a senior official says.
   En route Monday to Moscow to meet with the general secretary,
Baker said his goal is ``to make it clear to the Soviets that we
are seeking an active, constructive, positive and expanding
relationship.''
   ``If we find that the Soviet Union is serious about new global
behavior, then we will seek diplomatic engagement in an effort to
reach mutually beneficial results,'' Baker said.
   A senior official expanded on those remarks, telling reporters
on Baker's flight from Washington that the Bush administration
would welcome Moscow's help promoting Arab-Israeli negotiations and
was not trying to exclude the Soviets from those peace efforts.
   ``We ought not to somehow be worried about the Soviet Union
being a participant in trying to enhance the prospects for peace in
the Middle East,'' the official said. ``The problems there are
extraordinarily intractable. We welcome all the help we can get.''
   But the official, who responded to questions only on condition
of anonymity, ruled out U.S. concessions in Afghanistan or
negotiations to remove short-range nuclear missiles from Europe.
   He insisted the Soviets should suspend their military aid to the
Marxist government of Nicaragua, estimated at $500 million a year,
and show interest in a peaceful solution in the Middle East by
resuming diplomatic relations with Israel and exerting influence on
Syria.
   The official said the United States would not stop aiding the
Afghan rebels in their war with the Kabul government, which was
supplied with Soviet arms and equipment before the Red Army left
the country in February.
   Baker, who has never been to the Soviet Union before, is due in
Moscow on Wednesday morning for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze. They plan to meet again Thursday morning,
and Baker will see Gorbachev for two hours in the afternoon.
   The U.S. entourage, including State Department, Pentagon and
National Security Council officials, stopped first in Helsinki to
rest, confer and meet with Finnish officials.
   Baker met with Shevardnadze in Vienna in March before the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact opened
negotiations to reduce non-nuclear armor and artillery in Europe.
   Since then, a U.S. dispute with West Germany over NATO's
short-range nuclear missiles has rattled the Western Alliance's
unity.
   The Germans are resisting U.S. efforts to more than triple the
missiles' range to 250 miles, and are demanding U.S. negotiations
with the Soviets to reduce tactical nuclear weapons on both sides.
   The Bush administration has refused, arguing that would hurt
NATO's defenses.
   If Gorbachev tries to capitalize on the disagreement, Baker
simply will refuse to discuss the missiles, the official said.
   He predicted the alliance will resolve the problem before or at
the NATO summit meeting President Bush will attend with the leaders
of the 15 other allied countries May 29-30 in Brussels.
   Baker intends to give priority during his Moscow meetings to the
proliferation of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons, which has
alarmed the Bush administration.
   Baker will press the Soviets to reconsider joining a
seven-nation Western control group seeking to end the sale of
ballistic missile technology to Third World nations, the official
said.
   The group, known formerly as the Missile Technology Control
Regime, was formed in April 1987 by six NATO allies _ France, West
Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and the U.S. _ and Japan to ban the
export of missiles and related technology to be used to build
missiles capable of carrying a payload 168 miles or more.

   Two Navy jet fighters collided in
flight Monday over the Sierra Nevada, killing one pilot who went
down with his aircraft and injuring the other, officials said.
   The FA-18 Hornets, based at Point Mugu Naval Air Station,
collided around 11 a.m.
   The single-seat jets went down about 45 miles apart _ one into
the remote foothills of the Inyo National Forest, the other into
sand dunes to the south.
   Witnesses reported seeing one parachute and a Navy spokesman
said the dead pilot did not eject from his aircraft.
   ``We have one confirmed fatality and one injured,'' Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Gene Okamoto said from Point Mugu. ``The pilot who was found
dead was found in his aircraft.''
   The pilots' names were withheld until relatives could be
notified, Okamoto said. The surviving aviator's condition wasn't
immediately available, but a Navy spokeswoman said his injuries
weren't serious.
   Vicki Wood, owner of a gas station, heard an explosion and
looked up to see the aftermath of one jet's plunge onto the desert
floor.
   ``It was like a big sonic boom,'' Ms. Wood said. ``It went down
in the sand dunes and this big mushroom cloud came up. There was
one big orange parachute.''
   The injured pilot was taken to Lone Pine Hospital for treatment.
``He felt good enough (that) he felt he didn't need to go,'' said
Loretta King, spokeswoman for nearby China Lake Naval Weapons
Center.
   One of the planes went down in the foothills of the Inyo
Mountains, 10 miles northeast of Independence, about 175 miles
north of Los Angeles. The other crashed in sand dunes 4{ miles east
of Olancha, said Cynthia Krell, spokeswoman for the Inyo National
Forest.
   Smoke was seen pouring from the aircraft that crashed in the
forest and there was no sign of the pilot, Ms. Krell said.
   The $23 million FA-18 Hornet is a single-seat, twin-engine jet
fighter that can be used for either air-to-air combat or
air-to-ground attack.
   The plane, the Navy's most modern jet fighter, is built by
McDonnell Douglas Corp. The aircraft flies more than 1.7 times the
speed of sound and can be fitted with a variety of air-to-air and
air-to-ground missiles and bombs.

<TEXT>
   Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel
Prize in literature, is as unruffled by death threats from Moslem
fundamentalists as he is by his new wealth and international
acclaim.
   ``At my age, there's no fear about being killed,'' said the
frail 77-year-old writer as he sat at his usual table by the
picture window of Ali Baba, a cafe overlooking downtown Cairo's
busy Tahrir Square. ``I refused police protection because this
would tie down my freedom of movement.''
   As he spoke, he slowly sipped Turkish coffee, without sugar
because he's diabetic.
   Mahfouz, the first author who writes in Arabic to receive the
Nobel literary prize, is a man of routine, and his routine has not
changed in the month since an Egyptian fundamentalist sheik
declared him an apostate, a rebel against his religion.
   Islam decrees that he must repent or die, said Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, who had been acquitted of charges he instigated the
1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat with a similar
proclamation.
   ``Security authorities say there are some young extremists who
might act on Abdel-Rahman's words,'' Mahfouz said. ``They advised
me to accept protection.''
   Abdel-Rahman's declaration did not arouse the reaction among
many Moslems abroad as did condemnation of Moslem-born British
writer Salman Rushdie.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said his novel ``The Satanic Verses''
blasphemes Islam and ordered the author's death. The book has been
banned in predominantly Moslem countries, including Egypt.
   On this day, as always, Mahfouz walked alone to the Ali Baba
cafe, about a half-hour from his home, where he lives with his
wife, Atyatallah, and two grown daughters. He travels the same
route every day and said he has no intention of changing it,
despite the anxiety of family and security authorities.
   The author of works including 40 novels still goes to his Friday
literary meetings at a Nile riverside restaurant and to Thursday
get-togethers with a poet, an actor and three other close friends.
   ``Nothing has changed for me,'' Mahfouz said about the impact of
the Nobel Prize money, a $390,000 award that his daughters traveled
to Sweden in December to receive. Mahfouz's delicate health,
including impaired eyesight and hearing, kept him at home.
   He said he divided the money equally among himself, his wife and
his two daughters. Mahfouz donated his quarter to a charity
organization at Al-Ahram, a state-run newspaper and Mahfouz's
long-time employer.
   Al-Ahram was at the center of a controversy 30 years ago that
led to Mahfouz's current friction with fundamentalists. In 1959,
the newspaper's serialization of Mahfouz's ``Children of Gebelawi''
drew the attention of the sheiks at Al-Azhar, the Cairo institution
that is Islam's center of theology.
   They immediately banned it as blasphemous and spoke of trying
Mahfouz for apostasy because the book wrongly depicted biblical
figures.
   The ban never was lifted, but Mahfouz was left in peace. After
his Nobel triumph, Al-Azhar leaders received Mahfouz warmly at the
venerated institute.
   A new threat arose in early April with Sheik Abdel-Rahman's
``fatwa'' or religious opinion that the book proved Mahfouz had
abandoned Islam and unless he repented must be killed under Islamic
law.
   Nobody outside Fayoum, Abdel-Rahman's hometown southwest of
Cairo, knew of the proclamation until the blind cleric repeated the
opinion in an interview published on April 13 with the Kuwaiti
newspaper Al-Anbaa.
   Abdel-Rahman had been arrested a week earlier for leading an
anti-government demonstration in Fayoum.
   The interview was not published in Egypt and had no noticeable
effect.
   Mahfouz was among Moslems who condemned Khomeini's call for
Rushdie's death, saying it amounted to ``terrorism ... against
humanity because it is against thought and against human rights.''
   Nevertheless, he said Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' was
repugnant and that he supported a boycott of its publishers.
   Mahfouz said Abdel-Rahman's condemnations followed a campaign
against Mahfouz's writings by fundamentalist publications that
began soon after he won the Nobel Prize in October.
   The campaign ``was a sort of provocation, and the security
authorities became more worried after Abdel-Rahman's comments,''
Mahfouz said. ``My wife and daughters also asked me to change my
lifestyle.
   ``But I can't.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Women Take More Sick Days Than Men</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sickness keeps women away from their jobs
slightly more often than men, according to a study by the National
Center for Health Statistics.
   A study between 1983 and 1985 of the health of workers found
that women averaged 5.5 sick days annually, compared with 4.3
missed days of work for men.
   Reasons were not included, however. ``There could be many
possibilities,'' said John Gary Collins, one of the authors.
   The Labor Department, however, did suggest reasons in a 1985
survey that found 3.7 percent of men and 6.3 percent of women
missed a day of work in a given week.
   ``Understandably, women have higher incidences of absenteeism
during their child-bearing years, especially women with children
under age 6,'' the department's analysis said. ``For most women the
period of lost time increases with the presence of children.''
   Time taken off to give birth does not count in the absenteeism
statistics, Collins said.
   The health figures for men and women issued Monday are the first
published portion of a more extensive analysis that will eventually
include comparisons of health and sick time by income, education
and other variables.
   Collins said that comparative figures for men and women, which
the center has not collected before, were included in this study
because women now comprise such a large portion of the work force:
44 percent at the time of the study.
   The study found that 11.2 percent of women took eight or more
sick days a year, while 7 percent of men had eight or more days of
lost work.
   The most sick days, on average, were taken by women in the
transportation and materials moving industries at 9.3. Women
machine operators, assemblers and inspectors averaged 8.7 lost work
days. Female handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers and operators
lost 7.9 days and 7.5 days were lost by women precision production,
craft and repair workers.
   For men, machine operators, assemblers and inspectors was the
category with the most lost days at 6.3. Men in transportation
missed 5.7 days, followed by 5.2 for farming, fishing and forestry
workers and 5.1 for male handlers, equipment cleaners and helpers.
   The fewest lost work days were 3.0 for men in the professions
and 3.3 for women working in farming, forestry and fishing.
   Asked to assess their own health, the largest groups saying they
were in poor health were women doing household work _ 19 percent _
and men working in farming, fishing and forestry, 10.8 percent.
   Those same categories were the ones in which people tended to
report being hindered by chronic conditions of one sort or another.
   Farming and household workers tend to be older, and thus are
more likely to have chronic conditions and poor health, Collins
said.
   The study also compared the rates of six chronic conditions
among working men and women.
   Men led in high blood pressure, 118.0 per 1,000 compared with
102.6 per 1,000 women. Men were also more likely to be hearing
impaired, 102.2 per 1,000 compared with 55.6 for women.
   Women had more hay fever, 118.3 compared with 98.3 men per
1,000. Other rates were for chronic sinusitis, 181.3 for women and
144.8 for men; arthritis, 124.0 for women and 88.3 for men, and
impairment or deformity of the back, 82.2 for women and 65.1 for
men.
   The analysis was based on a survey of 117,000 households
containing 303,000 people. The margin of error was not reported in
the study.

   Police have been investigating
allegations that some singers had to pay bribes of up to $85,000 to
perform in the San Remo festival, Italy's most popular annual
pop-song contest.
   Court sources said Monday that the results of the two-month
investigation have been given to Ugo Giudiceandrea, the chief
prosecutor in Rome, who will decide whether to file charges.
   Police said the charges under consideration include extortion
and fraud.
   Police sources in this gambling resort along the Italian Riviera
indicated that little-known singers and their recording companies
paid bribes ranging from $42,500 to $85,000 to appear in the
contest.
   The show can boost a singer's popularity and royalties because
it is telecast nationally on the state-controlled network for three
straight nights.
   The Italian media has identified a few singers and some
companies that have contended they paid bribes, but police have not
confirmed the reports.
   The news reports said several singers began irate protests and
filed suits after they said they paid bribes and were entered in
the contest but never appeared on television.
   A jury named by the private organization that runs the contest
selected songs and singers for the 39th edition of the festival in
February.
   Adriano Aragozzini, who headed the organization, was quoted by
Milan's daily Corriere della Sera as saying ``I'm not involved in
the scandal. If someone got the money for entering singers in the
competition he's was not part of my party.''
   Teddy Reno, the manager-husband of Italian singer Rita Pavone,
said ``it has long been a practice in San Remo to select singers on
the basis of many reasons but artistic quality.''
   He added, however, that he was not asked for any money to have
his wife selected for this year's contest. Pavone's song was
eliminated by the jury.
   The most popular Italian pop singers such as Jovanotti, Anna
Oxa, Fausto Leali, Albano and his American wife Romina Power,
competed in the contest, which also had separate sections for
emerging and new artists.

<HEAD>Two Former Reagan Cabinet Members Summoned to Testify on Possible
HUD Abuses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel is calling on two Reagan Cabinet
members to address an official's claim that he was unfairly singled
out in a probe of favoritism in a $225 million federal housing
program.
   A House Government Operations subcommittee Monday said it would
seek the testimony of former Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Samuel Pierce and former Interior Secretary James Watt to
help evaluate former federal housing commissioner Thomas Demery's
claims.
   Demery was targeted in a HUD inspector general's report two
weeks ago that alleged ``a perception of favoritism'' in awarding
money to renovate housing for the poor. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp
temporarily halted the program and blocked some $100 million
pending contracts.
   An angry Demery, who complained about being ``singled out for
top billing,'' told the subcommittee on employment and housing
Monday that the report by Inspector General Paul A. Adams was
motivated by ``malice, negligence and a coverup, or a combination
of the three.''
   Demery testified that problems existed in the ``moderate
rehabilitation program'' before he assumed his post in October
1986. He served until last November.
   Demery said one of his HUD predecessors, Silvio Debartolomeis,
was reluctant to sign funding requests for the program in 1986. He
also questioned why Deborah Gore Dean, former executive assistant
to Pierce, was mentioned only briefly in the 700-page report.
   Demery ``made a lot of statements on the record that need to be
verified'' by future witnesses, said subcommittee member Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   Adams told the committee poor documentation contributed to the
problem, and said highly paid consultants _ including former HUD or
other government officials _ used their clout to win contracts for
developers.
   The subcommittee wants Watt, President Reagan's first interior
secretary, to testify about his work as consultant on behalf of a
312-unit project in Essex, Md. Watt earned a $300,000 fee despite
indicating that he had little knowledge of the program, Adams said.
   ``Mr. Watt's only known experience in the field of housing was
making Bambi homeless,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.
   Other consultants included the late John Mitchell, attorney
general under President Nixon; former Republican Sen. Ed Brooke of
Massachusetts; former Kentucky Gov. Louis Nunn, also a Republican;
and other top HUD officials under Pierce.

   Two scientists who say they achieved nuclear
fusion at room temperature appeared before nearly 2,000 fellow
chemists Monday night to counter critics who doubt their claim.
   Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons disputed critics who
accused them of sloppy measurements, saying scientists who have
been unable to duplicate their experiments failed to use large
enough electrodes made of the metal palladium.
   In their latest experiment, they said they produced up to 50
times more energy with their device than what they had put it. The
energy was emitted as a burst of heat that lasted two days, they
said.
   In their initial announcement, in March, they said they had
produced four times the amount of energy than was used.
   Pons, of the University of Utah, and Fleischmann, of the
University of Southampton in England, announced March 23 that they
achieved nuclear fusion in a jar at room temperature.
   Such an accomplishment, if confirmed, could lead to a cheap and
virtually inexhaustible source of energy.
   The two scientists said they did it by sending a current through
an apparatus in which a palladium electrode was wrapped in platinum
and soaked in a container of heavy water. Heavy water is made from
an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium and oxygen.
   Last week, delegates at the American Physical Society meeting in
Baltimore accused the Utah-based Pons and Fleischmann of
experimental errors.
   Some critics said Pons and Fleischmann were deluded into
thinking that their device produced excess heat through fusion
because they measured temperatures in the jar improperly and were
actually measuring hot spots.
   However, Fleischmann, appearing before 1,800 scientists at a
meeting of the Electrochemical Society Inc. at the Bonaventure
Hotel here, said there were no hot spots in his fusion device and
that the excess heat measurements were accurate.
   He even showed a short movie of gas bubbling through the fusion
device to support his claim that heat was distributed evenly
throughout the apparatus.
   ``This argument of ineffective (heat) mixing really doesn't hold
water,'' Fleischmann said.
   Pons said scientists who have been unable to reproduce the
Pons-Fleischmann team's findings failed to use adequately large
palladium electrodes.
   Using technical language, he lashed out at critics who contend
that neutrons allegedly generated by fusion in the experiment may
really have come from naturally occurring radon gas and radiation
in the Utah laboratory.
   He said that he and Fleischmann measured gamma rays _ an
indication of neutrons and thus fusion _ that came from their
experimental device but were not present elsewhere in the lab.
   But chemist Nathan Lewis of the California Institute of
Technology, who said at the American Physical Society meeting that
the experiment was done sloppily, reiterated his criticism Monday
night.
   ``There is no gamma radiation,'' Lewis said. ``There is no
fusion.''
   Stan Luckhardt of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also
strongly questioned the gamma-ray aspects of the Utah findings.
   Fleischmann acknowledged that the gamma-ray evidence was the
``least satisfactory'' part of their research. ``We are doing a
complete new set of measurements with improved techniques,'' he
said.
   The meeting was the first appearance by Pons and Fleischmann
before their fellow electrochemists, although they previously
discussed their findings at a meeting of the American Chemical
Society.
   Before the session started, scientists eager for more
information on the scientific controversy were forced to crowd like
sardines into a hotel hallway while Electrochemical Society
officials prepared the meeting room.
   Security guards repeatedly had to ask people to stand back and
not rush into the meeting room once the doors were opened.
   Also present Monday night was Steven Jones of Brigham Young
University, who showed a series of slides of 3-year-old notebook
pages to refute accusations that he borrowed heavily from Pons and
Fleischmann's work.
   Jones said his experiment and a more recent one conducted by
scientists at the University of Bologna in Italy found unambiguous
signs of fusion: neutrons released by such a reaction.
   He also said that he conducted his experiments with proper
scientific controls, finding neutrons when deuterium was used but
not when regular water was used.
   He said that an editorial in the British journal Nature
suggesting he did not use proper controls was ``just a mistake by
the editor _ a diatribe.''
   Since the March announcement, Pons and Fleischmann have been
called ``incompetent'' and ``deluded'' and a number of researchers
have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate the experiment.
   Physicists _ who have spent billions in pursuit of
high-temperature fusion _ have been the most vocal critics of Pons'
and Fleischmann's experiment.
   The two said their experiment yielded more than four times the
energy that produced it.
   Their claim to room-temperature fusion could undercut the
long-held belief that the process, which powers the sun and
hydrogen bombs, occurs only at extremely high temperatures.

   A robot probe was flying right on
target to Venus and Atlantis' astronauts landed here after a
successful four-day space shuttle mission that put U.S. planetary
exploration back on track.
   At Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., initial inspections of the
shuttle showed little damage to the thermal tiles, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration said.
   ``The vehicle looks as clean as any one that I've ever seen,''
said Navy Rear Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's acting associate
administrator for space flight.
   Commander David Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe, and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard were greeted
at Ellington Field late Monday by 200 relatives, friends,
co-workers and even a few of the family dogs.
   ``It's really nice to have the mission finished and we couldn't
have done it without you,'' said Ms. Cleave, who helped deploy the
Magellan probe.
   She said the astronauts had a great time and it was good to be
back knowing that there's a spacecraft en route to Venus and ``we
were all a part of it.''
   After returning to work today, the crew planned to view
photographs taken during their 1.68-million-mile journey, Johnson
Space Center officials said.
   On Wednesday, the astronauts will begin briefing officials.
   The 97-ton Atlantis glided to a smooth landing as scheduled at
3:43 p.m. EDT Monday afternoon.
   Twelve minutes before touchdown, the crew was ordered to land on
a concrete runway rather than a hard-packed clay runway because
crosswinds on the runway were too high.
   ``Obviously this mission was an outstanding success,'' NASA
science chief Lennard Fisk told reporters at Edwards Air Force Base.
   ``Magellan is on its way to Venus. The deployment was very
successful. The trajectory is about as accurate as you can get. The
spacecraft is working without any difficulties whatsoever.''
   Truly praised the performances of the crew, the shuttle and the
Magellan.
   ``With all these things coming together, it's really hard not to
have a big grin on your face and be proud of what we're doing,''
Truly said.
   About 27,500 spectators, the smallest crowd ever to attend a
shuttle landing, withstood the 90-degree heat to watch. The
smallest previous crowd was 35,000, in 1985. An estimated 460,000
were here for Discovery's landing March 18.
   Thursday's deployment of Magellan was the mission's primary goal.
   The $550-million Magellan mission is the first U.S. planetary
probe launched in 11 years and the first ever from a shuttle. In
October, another Atlantis crew is to start the Galileo on its way
to Jupiter.
   Early today, Magellan was more than 676,000 miles from Earth and
was zipping along at a rate of nearly 6,000 mph. It will travel 806
million miles and loop 1{ times around the sun before reaching
Venus in August 1990.
   Once in orbit above the cloud-shrouded planet, the probe will
use its high resolution radar to map up to 90 percent of the
Venusian surface.
   The radar images to be collected by Magellan are expected to
show features as small as a football field and be 10 times clearer
than pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft. The pictures should
provide an avalanche of data that could help scientists discover
how Venus evolved so differently from Earth.
   The weight of the probe and its rocket booster _ 45,000 pounds _
restricted the number of experiments the shuttle could carry.
   The crew did work on an experiment involving crystallizing a
metal sample in a furnace and photographed lightning and pollution
on Earth.
   The only glitch reported occurred Sunday when one of the
shuttle's four main computers failed and the crew replaced it with
the on-board spare.
   The problem posed no threat to the flight, but ground
controllers decided to take no chances and had the spare installed.
NASA said the shuttle could land with only one computer.

   The secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
has signed a pact to open a National Museum for the American Indian
here, but legislation is needed to provide the funds to pay for it.
   Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams on Monday signed an
agreement to take title to New York City's Heye Foundation
collection, the world's premier collection of American Indian
artifacts.
   ``I don't think there ever will have been a museum quite like
the one we foresee, with great confidence, going up on the site
behind me,'' Adams said at the signing ceremony.
   Roland Force, director of the New York-based Museum of the
American Indian that currently houses the collection, presented
Adams with a peace pipe-tomahawk given to Tecumseh, the Shawnee
chief, by Col. Henry A. Proctor of the British Army in 1812.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, pledged to introduce a bill this week
to begin efforts to secure the money.
   The Smithsonian would build the museum in the last available
space on the Mall, between the Air and Space Museum and the
Capitol. It also agreed to construct additional storage space for
the collection in Suitland, Md.
   In addition to transferring the bulk of the Heye Foundation
collection to Washington, the accord calls for moving the Museum of
the American Indian from its cramped location in New York City to a
larger federally owned building there. The facility would be
renamed the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the
American Indian and display a small portion of the 1 million-piece
collection.
   Adams estimated it would take six years before the Washington
museum's doors open. In addition to securing financing, the plan
must be approved by New York state courts.
   Earlier this year, Adams estimated the project would cost more
than $150 million.

   Town Chairman Myron Lotto says Wisconsin's
not big enough for two De Peres. He wants to change this rural
town's name to avoid confusion with the adjacent city of De Pere.
   ``We've never been able to refer to the town of De Pere as De
Pere because there's the city of De Pere,'' Lotto said.
   ``You can refer to the town of Bellevue as Bellevue,'' he said
of that nearby community. ``But we don't have our own identity.''
   Lotto said he placed the matter on the agenda for Wednesday's
Town Board meeting. A contest would be held to select a new town
name, he said.
   Lotto said he also planned to ask officials of the city of De
Pere if they would consider changing its name. But city
Administrator Jerome Smits said Lotto would be wasting his time.
   Smits said many towns in the state carry the same names as the
cities they abut and don't suffer from an identity crisis.
   ``You have the town of Green Bay and the city of Green Bay,''
Smits said of his city's next-door neighbor, ``and that sort of
thing is existent in many, many other areas.''

   The final exam was scheduled well in

concerned, it still was from out of the blue.
   Caron, who teaches human sexuality to 500 students at the
University of Maine, hired a sky diver to deliver her exam to
students waiting on the mall in front of the library.
   ``We wanted to be creative,'' Caron said. ``Here is it, finals

to relax before the exam.''
   Caron said students were told only to gather on the mall shortly
after 6 p.m. to pick up their exams before taking them into Hauck
Auditorium.
   Skydiver Scott Delong, a member of the university's parachute
club, descended under a green and white chute carrying the exams.
   ``He was amazingly accurate. He landed right where we wanted,''
said Caron.

   Bluesman B.B. King, who has traveled the
world with his guitar ``Lucille,'' is looking for a home in Memphis
and plans to open a club in the Beale Street entertainment district
next year, his manager says.
   King got his professional start and his stage name in Memphis in
the late 1940s.
   ``After all, he is named B.B. King, which is `Beale Street Blues
Boy,' and that goes back to the basic roots,'' manager Sid
Sidenberg said Monday by telephone from New York.
   From the late 1800s through the 1950s, Beale Street was a
bustling entertainment and commercial district for blacks. Recent
efforts to develop it into a major tourist center have been
disappointing.
   Sidenberg said the district is coming along, however, and the
time is right for the blues guitarist and singer to give it a try.
   ``We decided to open up a club so we can use it as sort of a
sounding board for new talent as well as B.B. himself coming down
and having fun playing in his hometown,'' Sidenberg said.
   King will move his primary residence from Las Vegas to Memphis
but will still be on the road most of the time, Sidenberg said.

   ``New Hampshire Vice'' doesn't have quite
the same alluring ring as ``Miami Vice.'' But no matter, Gov. Judd
Gregg is trying to entice its star, Don Johnson, to New Hampshire.
   Gregg sent a letter to the television celebrity Monday, inviting
Johnson to film his next movie in New Hampshire. The invitation was
prompted by the star's income tax problems in neighboring Vermont,
where he owes $50,000.
   ``We regret the impasse you have reached with our sister state.
Still, a good Yankee never passes up an opportunity, so I want to
point out that New Hampshire has no state income tax and no sales
tax,'' Gregg wrote.
   Johnson has appealed the tax bill, and Vermont officials say
he's threatened to blackball the state in the film industry if he
is forced to pay.
   Residents of Hyde Park, Vt., where Johnson filmed ``Sweetheart's
Dance'' in 1987, were outraged when the Senate Finance Committee
last week approved legislation to exempt movie stars from the
Vermont state income tax. The committee reversed its decision a few
days later.

   Actor Mickey Rourke wants to make a new

   Rourke made the comment during a weekend news conference in
Salvador, on Brazil's northeast Atlantic coast, where he and

Orchid,'' directed by Zalman King.
   Rourke said he's willing to direct a new ``9{ Weeks'' himself,
to make his character John ``more mature, more intimate.''
   The original film, co-starring Kim Basinger, produced only so-so
box office revenues in the United States, but has become a widely
seen cult film in Brazil and much of Western Europe.

   Country music singer Hank Williams Jr.
thinks someone slipped him some drugs before a weekend concert in
which he cursed, failed to finish a song and stumbled offstage, his
publicist said.
   Williams, who was back at his farm in the Tennessee town of
Paris, told his Nashville publicist he had several alcoholic
beverages before Saturday night's performance in Baton Rouge, La.
   Williams recalled feeling fine when he went to the Centroplex
arena several hours before the show for a sound check, spokesman
Kent Arwood said.
   ``What Hank told me is that, `Really, after that, I don't
remember much of anything until I woke up Sunday morning,' '' said
Arwood. ``He said, `I wasn't drunk on stage. I know what it's like
to be drunk, and I wasn't drunk.'
   ``Hank said, `I know for a fact someone slipped me some drugs or
something. I had a problem with drugs years ago and I know that
feeling. That's obviously what happened,' '' Arwood said, who spoke
to Williams on Monday for the first time since the concert.
   Angry fans in the audience of about 7,000 threw beer bottles and
burned souvenir T-shirts, but there were no arrests or injuries,
police said.
   Williams, 39, who is known for his songs about hard drinking and
rowdy living, agreed to pay $65,000 to Centroplex to cover the
arena's losses, said Michael M. Pierce, director of the arena.
   Arwood said Williams has offered to do another concert at his
own expense on May 23 at the arena.
   Williams, voted entertainer of the year three times by the
Academy of Country Music, stormed offstage 40 minutes into a
concert April 2 in Bristol. A spokesman for the singer cited the
flu, but the city's Viking Hall has banned Williams because of his
behavior.
   Williams' father, the country singer-songwriter Hank Williams
Sr., died in 1953 at age 29 from the effects of alcohol abuse.

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest round of Cambodian peace
talks ended in a rosy glow of optimism but the hard bargaining has
yet to begin.
   The encouraging results in Jakarta, the unprecedented dialogue
in recent months and the general warming of ties among the United
States, China and the Soviet Union have created a momentum toward
peace. Differences still divide the warring factions in Cambodia,
however.
   In the jargon of negotiators, the quest for an end to Cambodia's
10-year jungle war is divided into ``external'' and ``internal''
factors.
   The external include the withdrawal of Vietnam's troops and the
halt of outside aid to the warring guerrilla factions. The big
internal factor is how the factions will share power.
   Vietnam has promised to withdraw the last of its estimated
50,000 to 70,000 soldiers by the end of September, regardless of
whether a political settlement is reached.
   The warring factions have agreed to allow international
observers to monitor the withdrawal. Details are to be worked out
at an international conference in Paris July 24-25.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev confers with Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping in Beijing May 15-18 in the first China-Soviet
summit in 30 years. The Cambodian question, a major obstacle in
normalizing relations between the two nations, is expected to be
high on the agenda.
   The Vietnamese Communists and Cambodian Khmer Rouge guerrillas
came to power in the spring of 1975, defeating U.S.-backed
governments in South Vietnam and Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge forcibly tried to turn Cambodia into an agrarian
commune and hundreds of thousands of people died in purges or of
starvation.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the Khmer
Rouge and set up another communist government.
   Moscow has supported Vietnam and its regime in Phnom Penh.
Beijing has backed the Khmer Rouge, still widely feared by many
Cambodians and now the strongest of three factions in a guerrilla
resistance coalition.
   Some officials fear the Soviet Union and China could reach
agreement swiftly and, as in Afghanistan, give up their supporting
roles in the conflict before the Cambodian rivals have made peace.
   They fear the civil war would only drag on in such a situation.
   Persistent but unconfirmed reports say the Soviets, seeking
better relations with China and non-communist Southeast Asian
nations and an end to costly foreign military involvements, have
been pressuring Vietnam for a speedy withdrawal.
   Peace negotiations began in July after years of deadlock when
Indonesia played host for informal talks involving most of those
involved.
   The most important development came last week when guerrilla
coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, 67, said he would return
to Cambodia as head of state if the Vietnamese pullout is
independently confirmed and the constitution rewritten to his
satisfaction.
   Sihanouk's supporters and the non-communist Khmer People's
National Liberation Front are the other groups in the guerrilla
coalition.
   Diplomatic observers say Sihanouk seems ready to return with or
without the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who are said to be worried they
might be left out of a peace settlement.
   The Khmer Rouge was not directly represented at the Jakarta
talks. Sihanouk dismissed them as only interested in continuing the
war and he quoted Cambodian Premier Hun Sen as saying let them
``stay in the jungle.''
   Hun Sen and Sihanouk insist that Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge
founders be barred from any future government and the resistance
wants to reach a political settlement with Hun Sen before Vietnam
withdraws its forces.
   Without such an agreement, there is concern the Khmer Rouge
might regain power in Phnom Penh because of their superior military
capability.
   However, in a joint declaration last month, Vietnam and Cambodia
said that if any of the guerrilla factions continued to receive
outside aid, the Cambodian government reserves the right to call
for outside help.
   The United States, which provides the guerrillas of Sihanouk and
former Premier Son Sann with diplomatic support and non-lethal aid,
stepped up its campaign against the Khmer Rouge as the Jakarta
meeting began.
   ``The United States is totally opposed to a return to dominance
in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge,'' said state department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler in Washington.
   China's once unequivocal backing of the Khmer Rouge stymied
peace efforts for years. But now even Beijing has said the
guerrillas should not be allowed to return to power.

   Tests will begin soon in England on the safety
of a proposed vaccine for AIDS, an American researcher says.
   Allan Goldstein, an AIDS researcher at the George Washington
University School of Medicine, said 24 volunteers are being sought
in London to test the safety of a vaccine known as HGP-30.
   The volunteers, he said, must be free of any AIDS infection. A
second 24, to be used as a control group, also will be selected.
   Goldstein said the purpose of the year-long trial is to
determine if the candidate vaccine is safe to use on humans.
Earlier tests on laboratory animals did not reveal any problems of
toxicity or other adverse effects, he said.
   Control trials in the United States have not started, Goldstein
said, because the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for human experimentation.
   In laboratory tests, Goldstein said HGP-30 has been shown to
stimulate the production of antibodies which attack and kill both
the AIDS virus and cells in the body that are infected with the
AIDS virus.
   Two other vaccines, developed by other researchers, are also in
early safety trials, according to an FDA spokesman.

<NOTE>Bentsen Seeks Continuation Of Hurricane Flights</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Military weather reconnaissance flights should
not be halted because they provide necessary ``last-minute
warning'' to coastal areas when a hurricane is approaching, says
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney contends the flights, which
help forecasters predict the intensity and position of an
approaching hurricane, are not an Air Force mission.
   As a budget-cutting move, Cheney wants to deactivate the weather
reconnaissance units at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi at a
savings of $14 million. Bentsen contends the total annual cost is
closer to $25 million.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, is asking Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, chairman of
the Senate defense appropriations subcommittee, to continue funding
the Air Force's flights into the eye of an approaching hurricane.
   Bentsen said the cost is a mere fraction of the destruction that
could occur if coastal residents don't have the flights'
``last-minute warning needed to protect lives and property.''
   Unless the money is provided in next year's budget, Bentsen said
the flights could be halted Sept. 30. In this decade alone, eight
major hurricanes have hit the United States after Oct. 1.

   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. won almost $2.9
billion in defense research contracts last year, easily retaining
its top position in the field, the Defense Department says.
   The Martin Marietta Corp. ranked second for the second year in a
row with contracts totaling $2.03 billion, the Pentagon added.
   Among educational and non-profit entities, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology continued to hold the top ranking, winning
research contracts during the year worth $403.7 million. The
Aerospace Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., was close behind with
contracts worth $367 million, followed by Johns Hopkins University
with $353.9 million.
   Overall, the Pentagon increased its spending on research by just
over 3 percent in fiscal 1988, with awards worth a total of $22.5
billion. By contrast, the department spent $21.8 billion on
research in fiscal 1987.
   A great deal of last year's spending appeared to be related to
work on the ``Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system. The amount
of money invested in research on ``missile and space systems''
totaled $7.8 billion in fiscal 1988, or 34.6 percent of the total,
the Pentagon said.
   Those numbers were little changed from fiscal 1987, when missile
and space systems research consumed $7.9 billion.

   Insurance industry groups are accusing
consumer organizations of using distorted statistics to support
their arguments that industry inefficiency costs motorists up to
$20 billion a year in increased premiums.
   Five consumer groups, outlining a program they said could save
the average household as much as $277 a year on car insurance, said
Monday the most important proposed changes were aimed at reducing
insurer waste and inefficiency.
   In particular, the consumer groups said they want measures taken
to increase competition in auto insurance markets and to correct
``the industry's cost pass-through methods of rate-making, under
which profits rise with costs.''
   ``The enactment of such measures has the potential to reduce the
up to $20 billion in insurer waste and inefficiency by $8 billion
to $12 billon a year,'' the organizations said.
   Lowell R. Beck, president of the National Association of
Independent Insurers, responded, ``The $20 billion figure of
industry waste is drawn out of the air and is totally without proof
or foundation.''
   The American Insurance Association, in a separate statement,
said, ``The allegations of insurer inefficiency are based on
distorted statistics. In fact, insurers are efficient when compared
to many other industries, such as banking. The alleged inefficiency
is a smokescreen to prevent control of runaway lawsuit costs which
neither insurers nor consumers can afford.''
   The Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, National
Insurance Consumer Organization, U.S. Public Interest Research
Group and Public Citizen announced their proposal at a news
conference.
   ``This program is demanding but feasible,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, a group associated with consumer
advocate Ralph Nader. ``It should be embraced by the auto insurance
industry.''
   The proposal calls for repeal of antitrust exemptions for the
insurance industry that are contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act,
passed in 1945. It also calls for the repeal of state laws
prohibiting group sales and discounts by agents.
   It proposes measures to make more price information available to
consumers and the establishment of independent advocates to
represent the consumer point of view in government rate proceedings.
   The proposal also calls for requiring safety features in light
trucks and vans, widespread installation of airbags, increased use
of safety belts, and motorcycle-helmet laws.
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of Consumer Federation of
America, said the report ``explains how to lower auto insurance
rates by $15 billion to $23 billion.''
   ``This would save the average household $181 to $277,'' Brobeck
said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Says Services for Retarded Aren't Guaranteed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Constitution doesn't guarantee programs
for the mentally retarded living at home, a U.S. appeals court
ruled in reversing a judge's decision.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments that
cuts in services to the mentally retarded in Philadelphia violated
rights to equal protection and due process.
   ``It is impossible to find an affirmative state duty to protect
the mentally retarded living at home,'' the three appeals judges
said Monday.
   A group of 32 mentally retarded people and the Phildelphia
Police and Fire Association for Handicapped Children Inc. filed
suit in July after the city cut off services to 9,000 in a
cost-cutting measure.
   Attorney David Ferleger, who represented the plaintiffs, said he
was ``very disheartened'' by the ruling. He said it would be
appealed.
   In November, U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Broderick ordered
the city and state to continue providing the programs. Three months
later, Broderick ruled the state in contempt of his decision and
forced it to pay the city $4.93 million for the programs.
   The appeals court said the city could classify retarded
residents living with relatives and those at group homes
differently for a legitimate purpose.
   ``Jurisprudence on the equal protection clause recognizes that
the act of governing often requires a state to bestow a benefit on
some, but not all, of its citizens,'' wrote Chief Judge John J.
Gibbons.
   The panel rejected the lower court's ruling that the decision to
single out those living at home was arbitrary and irrational,
saying the action followed the city's desire to reduce spending
with a minimal disruption to the system.
   The court said even if retarded patients living at home
regressed because of the cutback, relatives might be willing to
continue providing care.
   But if cutbacks at community homes caused regression, the staffs
might be unable to handle the increased demands, forcing the
patients to enter institutions, the court said.
   To minimize the cuts, city officials opted to curtail services
they considered less critical, such as case-management and
family-support services, and maintain services they considered
vital, such as vocational training.
   Philadelphia Solicitor Seymour Kurland and a spokeswoman for the
Department of Public Welfare, which administers the state's
programs for the retarded, could not be reached for comment Monday
night.

<HEAD>Seabrook Foes Ask For NRC Stay Of Low-Power License</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts officials and other opponents of
the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear plant are urging federal regulators to
delay approval of a license that would permit low-power testing at
the plant.
   Seabrook foes filed a 10-page stay request Monday with the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the last regulatory maneuver in a
prolonged campaign to block a low-power license.
   ``It would be arbitrary and capricious to issue (the license)
... in light of the great uncertainty that Seabrook will ever
receive an operating license,'' wrote lawyers for Massachusetts,
the town of Hampton, N.H., and the New England Coalition on Nuclear
Pollution.
   The opponents cited Seabrook's financial condition _ the lead
owner has filed for bankruptcy protection _ coupled with geographic
and demographic conditions around the plant that they say make it
``virtually impossible to provide adequate sheltering or reasonably
prompt evacuations.'' Seabrook must have evacuation plans approved
to receive a full-power commercial license.
   Opponents argue that conducting low-power tests could endanger
workers and residents, make decommissioning much more expensive and
eliminate the chances of converting the $6 billion plant to another
form of energy production.
   ``Even temporary operation at low power will result in
irreversible plant contamination caused by radiation of the reactor
and its component parts, and the creation of high-level radioactive
waste,'' the opponents said in the petition. ``Should a
radiological accident occur at the Seabrook plant, it could cause
irreversible health damage to the population around the plant.''
   If the NRC refuses the stay request, the license will be issued
immediately, according to a March commission order. That decision
can come any time after Friday, the deadline for the plant owners
to respond to Monday's stay request.
   But the opponents also asked the NRC to grant a ``one-week
housekeeping stay'' if the commission rules against the initial
petition. That would give the opposition enough time to seek a
court-ordered stay pending a court appeal, attorneys argued.
   The opponents asked for a decision within two days on whether
they would receive the week-long postponement if the initial stay
is rejected.
   ``If not told that by Wednesday, we intend to go to federal
court by the end of the week,'' Massachusetts Attorney General
James Shannon said in a telephone interview from Boston. Shannon
said the appeal would be filed in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here.
   NRC spokesman John Kopeck declined comment on the stay requests,
noting only that the commissioners' schedule calls for a decision
after the plant's owners file their counter-arguments.
   Seabrook officials say they are ready to begin preparations for
low-power testing within 24 hours of receiving the license.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down VA Rules, Orders Vets' Claims Reopened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered the U.S. government to
reconsider the Agent Orange health claims of more than 31,000
veterans because existing rules ``sharply tipped the scales''
against those exposed to the toxic defoliant.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson struck down the Department
of Veterans Affairs' regulations that denied Agent Orange
service-related benefits for cancers and all other diseases except
one non-fatal skin condition.
   In a ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of Agent
Orange claimants, Henderson said the department was wrong to
require direct proof that the dioxin-containing herbicide caused
various diseases.
   The department, formerly known as the Veterans Administration,
should give claimants the benefit of the doubt, he said.
   Veterans' advocates praised the decision, which was made public
Monday.
   ``This is a major victory with far-reaching implications,'' said
Mary Sout, president of Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``The ruling validates what Vietnam veterans have been saying
for years, that the VA has failed to give Agent Orange victims a
fair hearing. ... I am optimistic that Congress will now act
quickly to resolve this most painful legacy of the Vietnam War.''
   Vietnam Veterans of America again will sponsor legislation to
require Agent Orange benefits for two types of cancer _ soft-tissue
sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma _ and establish a new,
independent scientific panel to study the herbicide's health
effects, said Barry Kasinitz, spokesman for the 35,000-member group.
   A similar bill was passed by the Senate last year but died in
the House, Kasinitz said.
   The veterans department was represented by the Justice
Department. Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown declined to comment on
the ruling, saying department lawyers had not seen it.
   The United States used Agent Orange to defoliate forests in
Vietnam. Its health effects are sharply disputed.
   In 1985, the VA ruled that only a non-fatal skin malady,
chloracne, could be considered an effect of exposure to the
herbicide. The agency based its ruling on a review of studies of
Agent Orange's effects by an 11-member scientific committee.
   Henderson rejected an attempt by the veterans' group to
challenge the scientific panel's review. But he said the standards
the VA used in making its rules violated a 1984 federal law
designed to help Vietnam veterans get health benefits.
   The VA improperly required proof of a cause-and-effect
relationship between the herbicide and a disease for which benefits
were sought, the judge said. Instead, the agency should have
required only that statistics show a significant correlation
between dioxin exposure and a disease, or an ``increased risk of
incidence,'' he said.
   The federal law does not spell out the proper standard, but
members of Congress who helped pass the law indicated they opposed
an overly stringent standard and felt that cause-and-effect proof
was unnecessary, Henderson said. The law's ``remedial purpose''
also favors a lenient standard, he said.
   The judge noted that the VA had relied on statistical
relationships, without requiring proof of causation, in granting
benefits to veterans who were amputees and developed heart disease.
Congress did the same thing in granting benefits to former
prisoners of war who suffered various diseases, Henderson said.
   He also said the VA erred by refusing to apply to its Agent
Orange regulations the same ``benefit of the doubt'' policy it used
to review individual benefit cases, which favors the veteran in
close questions.
   ``These errors, especially sharply compounded with one another,
sharply tipped the scales against veteran claimants,'' Henderson
said.
   Henderson's ruling does not require the government to add any
diseases to the service-connected list for Agent Orange. But
Kasinitz said he was encouraged by the performance of Veterans
Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski.
   ``We think that we probably stand a better chance of getting a
fair review under the current administration than we did under the
past one,'' Kasinitz said.

   Legend has it that Thomas Jefferson
used to look down by telescope from his hilltop Monticello home and
watch the construction of the university he designed.
   Officials of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation,
proprietors of Monticello, are afraid the third president would not
look so lovingly on the development the University of Virginia has
planned for the foot of his ``Little Mountain.''
   The proposal, an $11 million office complex for four state
agencies, has sparked what Daniel P. Jordan, executive director of
the foundation, calls ``a family squabble'' between the group and
Jefferson's university.
   The complex would not be visible from Monticello, where
Jefferson lived from his retirement in 1809 to his death in 1826,
only from the highway that winds its way up the heavily wooded
mountain to the red-brick mansion and its perfectly manicured
grounds.
   But Jordan said the ambiance of the roadway is terribly
important to seeing Monticello as it was when Jefferson lived
there. More than a half-million visitors each year begin their trip
to the home on that road, he said Monday.
   ``We are trying to preserve the integrity of the Monticello
entranceway,'' he said. ``You can't understand Jefferson unless you
understand the setting.''
   The foundation owns about 2,000 of the 5,000 acres that once
comprised Jefferson's estate. The university owns land to about
halfway up the mountain, including the 20-acre site of the proposed
development. Jordan said the foundation always assumed that land
was safe from encroachment.
   ``We never thought they'd want to do this,'' Jordan said. ``It
was a surprise and a shock.''
   The university plans to deed the land to the state Forestry
Department, which would then return to the school its current,
smaller quarters, located in the middle of campus.
   The foundation has objected to the plan, and is awaiting a
written proposal of possible alternatives from the university.
Those alternatives include flipping the blueprint of the
development so that it faces away from the access to Monticello
onto a different road.
   But Jordan said the foundation would prefer no development. He
would like to see the road become a protected parkway, like the
Mount Vernon parkway that leads eight miles from Alexandria to
George Washington's home. The road to Monticello is only 1{ miles
long, and the foundation already owns much of it, Jordan said.
   William Fishback, associate vice president for university
relations, would not speculate on whether the school might be
willing to give up the site, saying negotiations with the
foundation are still in ``the working-out stage.''
   ``Some other site may or may not be acceptable,'' he said. ``The
site that we're discussing is a preferable site to us.''
   Jordan and Fishback said they are optimistic the situation will
be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, who have always
been close.
   ``We hope that it will be resolved within the family. Nobody
wants a public furor,'' Jordan said.
   But Jordan said the proposal has made the foundation aware of
the threat of development on other, privately owned land near
Monticello.
   ``This issue has opened our eyes to the larger need of
protecting the setting,'' he said. ``We are the stewards of a
finite resource.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
apparently allowed international observers to monitor Panama's
presidential elections because he was sure his man would win,
former President Jimmy Carter said.
   ``He didn't have a clue that his man might lose,'' Carter told a
news conference Monday night.
   Carter, who said he met with Noriega on Saturday, was made to
feel unwelcome after he accused Panama's de facto leader of
stealing Sunday's election from opposition candidate Guillermo
Endara.
   Government candidate Carlos Duque denounced what he called
``obvious American intervention in affairs that only concern Panama
and the abuse by observers of Panamanian hospitality.''
   Duque also was referring to a delegation of observers sent by
President Bush that concluded Noriega's soldiers intimidated voters
and carried out widespread fraud.
   ``The delegation cannot certify that the election was a free and
fair election,'' said delegation chairman Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.
   Carter said he discovered proof of fraud when he examined vote
tallies being tabulated at the election center. He confronted
election officials, and his relationship with the government
quickly deteriorated, he said.
   The Georgian was forced to hold his news conference in a narrow
lobby of the Marriott Hotel because he was denied use of the nearby
government press center. A crowd of Noriega supporters stood
outside and jeered.
   Carter said the military had seized thousands of vote tally
sheets in a nighttime sweep.
   ``During the day those records have been discarded and
counterfeit documents have been substituted,'' he said.
   ``It's a military dictatorship rejecting the election it
condoned and set up,'' Carter said.
   Both Murtha and Carter cited a Roman Catholic Church exit poll
that gave Endara a 3-1 margin over Duque as evidence of a sweeping
opposition win.
   The Panamanian Committee for Human Rights, which invited 279
observers from 21 nations, also condemned the election as
fraudulent.
   The Bush delegation steered away from policy questions, saying
it would have to consult Congress and the White House first.
   However, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., an observer who left early
Monday, said the United States ``should now consider the use of
force in Panama.''
   ``We've tried economic sanctions, which have had almost no
effect on Noriega,'' Graham said.
   Carter disagreed, saying he didn't think the ``international
community ought to isolate Panama.''
   He said the treaties that bind the United States to turn over
the Panama Canal should on no account be violated.
   The question, he said, was, ``How do we exert proper influence
without punishing innocent people?''
   ``I hope there will be a worldwide outcry against this dictator
stealing this election from his own people,'' Carter said.
   At the White House delegation's news conference, former U.S.
Ambassador to Panama Jack Hood Vaughn said Washington should soon
be united on a plan to oust Noriega.
   ``If I was to talk with Manuel, I'd say `Watch yourself,'''
Vaughn said.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged
Tuesday while the U.S. dollar ended higher against the Japanese yen
despite reported dollar-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues finished at
34,031.87, losing 103.37 points, or 0.30 percent. The index had
gained 180.25 points for a 34,135.24-point record closing on Monday.
   The dollar ended at 135.00 yen, up 0.48 yen from the previous
day's 134.52-yen finish. The currency opened at 134.95 yen and
ranged between 134.90 yen and 135.05 yen.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market at about
the 134.90-yen level and sold about $200 million.
   ``Right now the dollar is not rising further. However, that's
not because of the central bank intervention, but because of
dollar-selling by speculative investors near the 135-yen level,''
said Takamasa Yamasaki, a dealer with Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   ``The Bank of Japan intervention this morning was successful in
smoothing trading, but it wouldn't help lower the current level of
the dollar,'' he added.
   Although the central bank intervention would not reverse the
dollar's trend, participants were unlikely to continue buying the
dollar to raise it beyond the 135-yen level, he said.
   Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a news
conference early Tuesday the current yen-dollar exchange rate level
was not much to worry about.
   ``We should wait to see what happens,'' he said.
   On the stock exchange, the market's main index erased its
marginal gain in early trading and plunged ``mainly due to the
dollar's hike against the yen,'' said an analyst with Nomura
Securities in Tokyo, speaking anonymously.
   The index started to fall as electric power issues plunged due
to the yen's weak performance, the analyst added.
   Other dealers said profit-taking selling after gains on seven
consecutive trading days also caused the Nikkei's decline.

<HEAD>African Pygmies Get First Glance at America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BEZDEK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pygmy singing troupe that had never been but a
few miles from their village in northern Zaire is entertaining
American audiences in their first performances before anyone but
their own people.
   They came at the risk of being exploited as spectacle, of not
being able to communicate their simplest wants if they got lost,
and of not being able to deal with a first airplane trip that
lasted for eight hours.
   The Batwa-Ekonda Pygmies are dancing and singing their
polyphonic music as part of ``Africa Oye!,'' a 10-week U.S. tour by
52 African performers. The tour opened at the Boston Opera House on
Thursday. It is now playing in New York and will travel to
Baltimore, Washington, D.C., San Antonio, Texas, and Los Angeles.
   The Pygmies give good early reviews to the venture.
   Mpata Lopoma and Botika Ekalaka, among five Pygmies in the
troupe, said so far they have liked the big-city buildings and all
the bustle. They didn't care much for some of the food, especially
American sandwiches, but they liked the rice from Chinese
restaurants, Danish pastry, fried chicken, and the breads.
   But mostly what they have liked so far are the people.
   ``We like that they like our music,'' said Lopoma.
   The Africans' performances in Boston often prompted hoots of
delight, rhythmic clapping and standing ovations.
   The Pygmies and other performers _ such as the magnificent
drummers of Guinea and the Kanouri of Niger, who through circular
breathing can play a horn for as long as they like without
noticeably drawing a breath _ often responded with smiles and waves
of mutual appreciation.
   Other acts include Papa Wemba, one of Africa's most popular pop
artists, and singer Kandia Kouyate, who is famous throughout Africa
for her lyric voice in which she tells the centuries-old history of
her Mandingue people in song.
   The show, two years in the making, got off to a shaky start. The
troupe's trip to Boston was delayed in Dakar, Senegal, because of
bloody ethnic riots. And the Pende mask dancers of northwest Zaire
created a little stir there when, feeling uncomfortably cool, they
built a fire outside their hotel.
   And Ekalaka said the Pygmies were a bit unsettled by the long
flight.
   ``We thought it would fall in the water,'' he said through a
translator.
   But once here, they were happy to be making music.
   Mel Howard, producer of the show, said he had counted on that
feeling to make the Africans feel comfortable. He said
modernization and the influence of missionaries in Africa have
stirred feelings there over the years that much of the indigenous
music and dance of Africa have become outmoded.
   Ekalaka and Lopoma said they were aware of those feelings.
   ``But we love music. We sing every day there is a reason to
sing, a marriage, funeral, any ceremony,'' Ekalaka said.
   The Pygmies were the least spectacular of the acts. But there
was a primeval elegance in their gentle swayings and polyphonic
singing.
   They live in northern Zaire, and for many years have been
assimilated into the Ekonda people. And their music reflects the
change.
   The Batwa-Ekonda Pygmies differ from more isolated Pygmies in
that they are taller _ pure Pygmies average several inches under 5
feet in height _ they draw as much sustenance from farming as
hunting, and they are not nomadic.
   Whatever happens on the tour, Ekalaka said, ``Africa Oye!''
already has bolstered their belief that their music and the music
of other tribes is worth preserving.

<HEAD>Lucille Ball Memorials: Fans Shed Tears for Woman Who Made Them Laugh</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Lucille Ball's fans shed tears
for the woman who made them laugh, as three cities held memorial
services in which the redheaded comedian was remembered with
prayers and applause.
   ``She was a whole package. There never will be another one like
her. I love her,'' said a tearful Carol Burnett following a
memorial Mass in suburban Santa Monica.
   More than a thousand people who packed the St. Monica's Catholic
Church rose to their feet and clapped for several minutes after
television minister the Rev. Robert Schuller asked them to
``applaud the Lord for Lucille Ball.''
   About 1,000 people also crowded a church in New York and 200
gathered in a Chicago church. All three memorial Masses began at 8
p.m. Monday, the time Miss Ball's three most popular programs were
often broadcast.
   The 77-year-old comedian who starred in one of television's
biggest all-time hits, ``I Love Lucy,'' died here April 26 of a
ruptured aorta, a major blood vessel, eight days after emergency
open-heart surgery.
   Miss Ball, known for her honed comedic timing, wide-mouthed
expressions and wacky antics, was popular among generations of fans
who watched ``I Love Lucy'' as a first-run show in the '50s and in
three decades of reruns.
   ``She showed her love in the only way she knew how, by making
you laugh,'' the Rev. James Fox told those gathered for the Roman
Catholic Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola in New York.
   Broadcaster Diane Sawyer told the crowd that the death of Miss
Ball may have settled a longstanding theological debate over
whether there is laughter in heaven.
   ``A God who would have created her would never let her laughter
be far from Him,'' said Ms. Sawyer.
   In Chicago, the Rev. Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick
Church that God gave the world talents like Miss Ball ``to show us
life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending.''
   ``She taught us that if we could love Lucy, we could love
ourselves,'' Wall said.
   In announcing the services, Miss Ball's family said: ``Monday
night was the time when most of the nation was used to being with
Lucy.''
   Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball
starred, ``The Lucy Show'' and ``Here's Lucy,'' aired Monday
nights. ``I Love Lucy'' had starting times on Mondays and other
days.
   ``Lucille Ball gave the gift of humor which produced
happiness,'' said Schuller at the Santa Monica service. ``Only God
knows how many husbands and wives weren't speaking _ and then
Monday night rolled around.''
   Fans lined up to get in the Santa Monica church as much as four
hours early. Florists delivered arrangements including a 3-foot
heart of red carnations with the words ``I Love Lucy'' written
across.
   Hundreds of people came forward during Holy Communion to receive
blessings from three priests, including a woman wearing an ``I Love
Lucy'' T-shirt.
   ``I think she would have loved it very much, and she lived her
life for the people who were in that room tonight,'' said Lucie
Arnaz, daughter of Miss Ball and the late Desi Arnaz.
   Gary Morton, Miss Ball's husband for more than two decades,
attended a private service for his wife last month. The actress'
remains were buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.

about abortion was unconstitutional, an appeals court said in
upholding an injunction.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday upheld a 1988
nationwide injunction blocking the regulations from taking effect.
   ``This is a resounding victory for a woman's right to make a
most personal decision without government interference,'' said
state Attorney General James Shannon, who sought the injunction
along with 14 national family planning associations.
   ``These regulations would have prevented health care
professionals from advising their patients on the basis of sound
medical judgment,'' he said.
   The regulations, passed under the Reagan administration, sought
to eliminate federal funding to family planning groups that
counseled women about abortions. The rules also sought to force the
groups to close or relocate if they shared space with anyone
offering abortion counseling or referrals.
   Nabers Cabaniss, director of the Title X program at the
Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency would have
no comment until it had studied the ruling. Title X authorized
federal financing of private and public family planning services.
   In affirming the injunction ordered by U.S. District Judge
Walter Skinner, the appeals court said a prohibition on abortion
counseling or referral ``imposes constraints upon a woman's freedom
to make reproductive decisions.''
   Relying on the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision, the
appeals court said that by imposing the regulations, then-Health
and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen ``has gone beyond a mere
refusal to fund and has interfered with the decisional process by
dictating what information a woman may receive and by intruding
into her relationship with her physician.''
   The court also held that prohibiting clinics or doctors form
advocating or promoting abortion violated First Amendment rights to
free speech.
   Scott Swirling, executive director for the Washington-based
National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association,
called the decision ``a major victory for patients and health
professionals and family planning clinics.''
   Challenges to the regulations are also pending in appeals courts
in Colorado and New York.
   However, Swirling and Shannon said the Boston court's decision
will have a more sweeping impact because Swirling's group, which
represents more than 85 percent of the nation's federally funded
family planning clinics, was a party to the Massachusetts appeal.
   Doug Johnson, legislative director with National Right to Life,
said he was surprised the appeals court acted before the Supreme
Court ruled on a recent Missouri challenge to the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion.
   The two cases raise similar constitutional questions surrounding
the abortion issue, he said, adding, ``It is quite possible that
the (Supreme Court's) ruling will require the circuit to revisit
the issue.''

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell today
after climbing for six trading days, while the dollar hit an
eight-month high against the yen despite central bank intervention,
market sources said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 103.37 points, or 0.30
percent, closing at 34,031.87. The index had gained 180.25 points
for a 34,135.24-point record closing on Monday.
   A Nomura Securities dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the index's fall resulted mainly from profit-taking selling
following continuous gains since April 26.
   ``Uncertainties over the foreign exchange rate also discouraged
Japanese investors' buying interest,'' he said.
   He said the dollar's rise to the 140-yen level might lead to an
interest rate hike, which would further discourage stock buying.
   ``An interest rate hike is unlikely if you consider only the
recent rate of growth in the Japanese economy, but it is very
likely if the dollar rises further, reaching the 140-yen level, for
instance,'' the dealer added.
   Trading was rather active, dominated by sell orders, with first
section volume estimated at 1.1 billion shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 135.00 yen, up 0.48
yen from Monday's 134.52-yen close and its highest close since
135.60 yen last Sept. 6.
   The dollar now has gained 3.83 yen since April 25.
   It opened today at 134.95 yen. When it reached its high for the
day of 135.05 yen in early trading, the Bank of Japan sold dollars
to check the rise, said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer at Chemical Bank.
   The central bank, which does not comment on its market
intervention, also was reported to have sold dollars on Monday.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the bank sold about $100 million today. The
dollar, however, went no lower than 134.90 yen during the day.
   Daiwa Bank dealer Takamasa Yamasaki said speculative investors
also sold dollars near the 135-yen level.
   Ms. Takeuchi said trading was thin, especially in the afternoon,
following the central bank intervention.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a news conference the
current yen-dollar exchange rate ``isn't that much of a concern. We
should wait to see what happens.''

<HEAD>Kinnock Presses For End To Unilateral Disarmament Platform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Neil Kinnock has called for
scrapping his Labor Party's vote-losing policy of unilateral
nuclear disarmament as well as the ``naive, shopping-list
socialism'' of party left-wingers.
   At the start of a two-day meeting of Labor's national executive
committee, Kinnock on Monday accused left-wingers of trying to
dissociate the party completely from the capitalist, market economy
system.
   ``It's the system we live in, and we have got to make it work
more efficiently, more fairly and more successfully in the world
market place,'' Kinnock told a news conference.
   ``That's what the policy review report is about, and we shall
reject any sort of naive, shopping-list socialism,'' he said.
   Labor, which has lost three elections in a row since 1979 and
has lurched further left in opposition, is midway through a
two-year review of its policies. The next general election will
probably be held in 1991.
   Kinnock and other party leaders want to water down the
unequivocal policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament, which has
undermined the party's chances of regaining support. The committee
was expected to vote on that policy today.
   The policy would commit a Labor government to scrap Britain's
nuclear weapons unilaterally and shut down U.S. nuclear bases in
this country within five years.
   On Monday, the committee voted by 23-4 in favor of a
Kinnock-backed policy to jettison commitments to renationalize all
state-owned industries sold by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
The policy favors renationalizing only the telephone and
telecommunications giant British Telecom, and the English and Welsh
water supply system, which is due to be sold within a year.
   The committee also voted in favor of raising income tax for
high-earners to 50 percent from the current 40 percent limit. A
Labor government also would build no more new nuclear power
stations, the committee agreed.
   On the economy, Kinnock has already succeeded in edging his
party to the right and denied that a Labor government would be
profligate.
   Labor, he said, would not ``promise to spend that which we have
not got. We will make stark decisions about priorities.''
   Left-wingers, such as former Cabinet minister Tony Benn, have
accused Kinnock of trying to dilute Labor's left-wing doctrines and
simply copy Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives.
   ``These policies are asking the electorate to disregard our
campaigns in the last two general elections,'' Benn said.

   A parade of chemists presented evidence
suggesting they created a nuclear fusion reaction in a jar at room
temperature, but they failed to convince critics who contend the
findings are delusion.
   ``There is no fusion'' in University of Utah experiments by
chemists B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann, said their most
vocal critic, California Institute of Technology chemist Nathan
Lewis.
   ``I don't think anything has been proved. It's going to take
time to sort it out,'' Ralph Brodd, former president of The
Electrochemical Society Inc., said after Fleischmann and Pons spoke
to 1,800 scientists attending the group's Monday night meeting.
   Last week, University of Utah Vice President James Brophy had
promised that Pons and Fleischmann would present new evidence at
the meeting. However, the only significantly new information they
offered was a report that their latest experiments produced even
more excess heat than their earlier one.
   Fleischmann and Pons acknowledged some problems in their
research, but said they still believed they achieved fusion in a
jar.
   ``I have always been ready to acknowledge the fact our
experiments could be faulty,'' Fleischmann, of England's University
of Southampton, told reporters. ``If we turn out to be wrong, I'll
be the first to admit it.''
   Fleischmann and Pons, of the University of Utah, disputed Lewis
and others who accused them of sloppy measurements. Pons said
scientists who have been unable to duplicate their experiments
failed to use large enough electrodes made of the metal palladium.
   The two chemists shocked the world March 23 when they announced
they created fusion by sending electrical current through a device
in which an electrode of palladium metal was wrapped in platinum
and soaked in heavy water. Heavy water is made from oxygen and a
form of hydrogen called deuterium.
   Such an accomplishment, if confirmed, could lead to a cheap and
virtually inexhaustible source of energy. Previous fusion research
focused on multimillion-dollar efforts to create fusion under
extreme pressures and high temperatures.
   Pons and Fleischmann said Monday their latest experiment
produced 10 to 50 times more energy with their device than the
amount they put into it. The energy was emitted as a burst of heat
that lasted two days, they said. In their initial announcement,
they said they had produced four times more energy than was used.
   Several other scientists also said they successfully produced
excess heat or other signs of fusion, such as neutrons, but stopped
short of saying their studies proved fusion had happened.
   ``Something real is happening here,'' said Stanford University's
Robert Huggins, noting that he got 40 percent more heat from his
experiment than he put into it.
   ``We do see neutrons clearly _ this is a clear signature for
fusion _ but at a very low level,'' said physicist Steven Jones, of
Brigham Young University.
   Jones said that he conducted his experiments with proper
scientific controls. He said an editorial in the British journal
Nature suggesting otherwise was ``just a mistake by the editor _ a
diatribe.''
   Lewis repeated the attack he launched against Pons and
Fleischmann during last week's meeting of the American Physical
Society in Baltimore.
   He disputed their claims that their device produced excess heat,
or that it yielded byproducts of fusion, including helium, tritium,
neutrons and gamma rays.
   Lewis said his own experiments showed the helium comes from
laboratory air, the tritium evolved from water in the experiment,
and the nature of the gamma rays was such that they couldn't
possibly have come from fusion.
   Fleischmann acknowledged the gamma-ray evidence was the ``least
satisfactory'' part of their research. ``We are doing a complete
new set of measurements with improved techniques,'' he said.
   However, he said his excess heat measurements were accurate, not
the result of measuring only hot spots in the fusion device. He
showed a short movie of gas bubbling through the fusion device to
support his claim heat was distributed evenly inside the apparatus.
   John Bockris, of Texas A&amp;M University, said 14 laboratories in
six nations have done cold fusion experiments that produced excess
heat as well as some form of radioactive emission indicating fusion.
   But he said the failure of many other labs to replicate the Utah
experiment may occur because of variations in the amount of
hydrogen in palladium electrodes. Hydrogen may act as a ``poison''
to prevent fusion of deuterium, Bockris said.

<TEXT>
   Six rodeo bulls and two cows escaped from
an overturned truck and charged a California Highway Patrolman and
several cars during a nearly 10-hour rampage before authorities
shot them.
   ``They charged anything that moved,'' Highway Patrol spokesman
Jim Gregg said.
   The animals ran loose after a trailer tipped over early Monday
near this central California town. One other bull was killed in the
crash.
   Owner Frank Pires of Strathmore asked authorities to kill them
instead of trying to round them up, Gregg said. The bulls, which
were being driven home from the Riverdale rodeo grounds, were
valued at $1,500 to $2,000 each.
   ``We were advised by the owner that they definitely were not
friendly, they were very aggressive stock,'' Gregg said. ``The
owner said `don't try to take them alive because somebody is going
to get hurt. Just eliminate them.'''
   Authorities closed the highway and diverted traffic while animal
control officers stalked the animals in the darkness with
high-powered rifles.
   One bull chased a patrolman onto the hood of his car, Gregg
said. Others charged cars. No injuries were reported, though, and
the last of the animals was destroyed 9{ hours after the accident.
   ``There was some real hazard if we didn't get them eliminated,''
Gregg said. ``It's very unfortunate, but it's one of those things.''

   A 15-year-old boy accidentally killed his
father when a wounded 300-pound black bear attacked the father and
the son tried to shoot the animal, authorities said.
   Darrell Holman, 37, and his son, Ben, of nearby Model, were bear
hunting Saturday when the accident occurred. The son shot his
father as the black bear began mauling his father, Las Animas
County Sheriff Lou Girodo said Monday.
   The father was dead of a gunshot wound to the chest when
deputies reached him on a mountainside near Aguilar, about 200
miles south of Denver.
   The bear was found dead by state Division of Wildlife officials
about a mile from where Holman was killed. Holman's death was the
first hunting fatality in Colorado since November 1987.
   ``That was a big bear for this country,'' said Girodo, adding
that Las Animas County has a large black bear population and is a
popular bear-hunting area. ``You consider that a bear that size has
the strength of 10 men.''
   The sheriff said Darrell Holman shot the bear with rifle when
the bear went for a bait of garbage, but the bear fled.
   Girodo said the Holmans tracked the animal and spotted the bear
near the crest of the mountain. When they saw the bear fall to the
ground, the Holmans approached it. The bear got up and ran straight
for them, Girodo said.
   ``The bear approached the father, and he shot it two more times,
but it did not stop the bear,'' the sheriff said. ``The bear pushed
the father against a rock and went at him as though he were going
to maul and chew him.''
   Ben Holman then fired at the bear at close range, but hit his
father, said Girodo.
   The shot scared off the bear, and the son ran down the mountain
to a car where his mother and sister were waiting for them, and he
drove the car to a ranch to notify authorities, the sheriff said.

<DATELINE>CHESTERTOWN, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Special advertising campaigns will be
directed toward blacks, Hispanics and Asians in an effort to ensure
minorities are not underrepresented in the 1990 census.
   C. Louis Kincannon, deputy director of the Census Bureau, said
Monday that undercounting is a problem today as it was 200 years
ago during the first census.
   He and other federal officials joined Gov. William Donald
Schaefer in kicking off a national publicity campaign for the
census next year and urged Americans to stand up and be counted.
   This town of about 3,100 people on Maryland's Eastern Shore was
picked for the celebration because in 1790, it was the young
American nation's population hub. About the same number of people
lived north, south, east and west of Chestertown.
   The day's main event was a parade down Chestertown's tree-lined
streets commemorating American history from 1790.
   The parade featured old trains and cars, a covered wagon and a
rocket, a make-believe George Washington _ state Comptroller Louis
L. Goldstein in a burgundy period costume _ and an astronaut, Air
Force Col. Loren J. Shriver, who served as grand marshal.
   In 1790, Thomas Jefferson and Washington were hoping the census
would show there were more than 4 million people. They were
disappointed when the count came in at 3.9 million, according to
the Census Bureau's Raymond Bancroft.
   Undercounting was a problem 200 years ago that persists today,
he said.
   The two American leaders wanted a larger population ``to show
England we were a big country,'' Bancroft said. But there are more
practical reasons today for making sure everyone is counted, he
said.
   Kincannon said a great deal is at stake in the census, including
about $35 billion a year in federal aid distributed to state and
local governments according to population.
   Census statistics also determine the makeup of elected
legislative bodies from the U.S. House of Representatives to city
councils.
   Kincannon estimated that about 99 percent of the people who live
in the United States were counted in the 1980 census.
   Regional Census Director Laverne Collins said she hopes people
realize census information is confidential. Illegal aliens are not
reported to immigration officials, and income levels are not turned
over to the Internal Revenue Service, she said.
   The 1990 census will cost about $2.6 billion during a 10-year
period, and about 500,000 people will be employed at the peak
counting, Ms. Collins said.

<HEAD>Government Preparing for Guerrilla Attack on Kandahar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Afghan armed forces are digging in
in the southern city of Kandahar, where they expect a major attack
by Moslem guerrillas this week, government sources said today.
   The city is considered more vulnerable than the eastern city of
Jalalabad, where a nine-week siege by the insurgents has failed to
dislodge government fighters.
   The guerrillas have been trying to capture an Afghan city for a
base for the so-called government-in-exile they set up in Pakistan
in February.
   The attack on Kandahar is expected at the end of Eid al-Fitr,
the three-day feast marking the end of the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Eid ended Monday night in Afghanistan but concludes today in
neighboring Pakistan because of different interpretations of the
lunar calendar. Pakistan is the base of the guerrillas, who have
been trying for 11 years to oust the pro-Soviet Afghan government
of President Najib.
   Najib has accused Pakistan of deploying about 15,000 soldiers
across the border near Quetta to help in an attack on Kandahar,
which is about 200 miles from Kabul, the capital.
   On Monday, the Afghan U.N. mission in New York accused Pakistan
of supplying soldiers for a new assault on Jalalabad.
   Pakistan supplies the rebels along with countries including the
United States. But it has repeatedly denied Afghan government
claims that it trains the guerrillas or has dispatched troops to
Afghanistan.
   Soviet ground forces commander Gen. Valentine Varennikov toured
Kandahar last week to inspect the city's defenses. His four-day
visit was primarily for consultations with Najib and senior Afghan
army commanders, a senior Soviet official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``It was an important visit, an inspection tour to see how well
the army is prepared for fighting,'' the official said.
   He said Varennikov was ``satisfied'' with the government's
planning.
   The Soviet Union ended nine years of intervention in Afghanistan
when it withdrew the last of its troops on Feb. 15. It continues to
supply weapons and ammunition to Najib's forces, who have
successfully held Jalalabad during a guerrilla siege now in its
ninth week.
   Kandahar, located on a plain about 60 miles from the Pakistani
border and 120 miles from Quetta, is considered more vulnerable to
attack than Jalalabad. The guerrillas have intermittently besieged
Kandahar for more than a year.
   Before the civil war began a decade ago, Kandahar was
Afghanistan's second-largest city after Kabul. Tens of thousands of
people have fled Kandahar, however, and government officials say
they don't know how many remain.
   Kandahar and the surrounding province is the home of the Durrani
tribe from which the nation's royal family came. Many people in the
area remain staunchly loyal to former King Zahir Shah, who was
overthrown in 1973.
   Najib also has blood ties to the Durrani, whose independence and
fighting skills are legendary in Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas control much of the countryside in Kandahar
province and elsewhere in Afghanistan but have never captured a
major city. A victory could give them the psychological momentum
for an attack on Kabul.

   Donald J. Trump says he got rival developer
Leona Helmsley to part with a pet piece of Boardwalk property in
Atlantic City, N.J.
   Mrs. Helmsley ``totally conceded defeat'' in her ``attempt to
deprive me of something to which I am entitled,'' Trump said Monday.
   According to Trump, Mrs. Helmsley agreed to sell the property to
Penthouse International, which in turn agreed to sell it to Trump.
He said the deal was sealed Monday.
   Trump said the property is now worth considerably more than the
$21 million option price he's paying, which was a reason Mrs.
Helmsley had tried to prevent the sale.
   A spokesman for Mrs. Helmsley did not return a call for comment.
   The property, between Trump Plaza and Caesars casinos, was owned
by Broadway and Missouri Corp., a company controlled by Harry and
Leona Helmsley.
   The dispute over the parcel prompted Trump to write bluntly to
Mrs. Helmsley last month that she has ``virtually destroyed'' her
husband through her mismanagement of his affairs.

   Among programs affected was BBC radio's flagship news and
current affairs program ``Today.'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
says she listens to it every morning.
   ``Today'' normally runs from 6:30 a.m. to 8:35 a.m. Today, it
was cut to news bulletins of two to five minutes every half hour.
   One bulletin reported details of the strike and said the unions
are demanding a 16 percent pay increase while the BBC is offering 7
percent.
   The BBC broadcast recorded current affairs features to fill the
time between news bulletins.
   Ten-minute news bulletins broadcast each hour on the BBC's
English language World Service were cut to two minutes. The 24-hour
service claims a worldwide audience of 120 million.
   The strike followed a 24-hour walkout on April 24, the first at
the BBC since 1985.
   The strikers are demanding that their pay be brought in line
with commercial broadcasting salaries. The unions say the national
average pay for a BBC journalist is about $28,400 a year compared
with $40,000 in commercial radio and television.
   The BBC's domestic TV and radio services are funded by a licence
fee paid by people who own TV sets. The government sets the fee
each year and the BBC says it cannot afford pay increases of more
than 7 percent.
   The annual fee for a black-and-white set is about $42 and for a
color set $110. The BBC says the fee has not risen in line with
inflation, currently running at 7.9 percent and expected to
increase, and has left the corporation short of money.
   The BBC World Service is funded by a government grant.

<HEAD>Bakker's Ministry Finds New Home in Orlando Shopping Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Jim Bakker's efforts
to rebuild his ministry will be centered in a nearly deserted
shopping center where he has moved his headquarters.
   Bakker and his wife, Tammy, broadcast their show live Monday
from their new studio in a boarded-up department store. During the
show, Bakker stepped over shards of glass and wire hung loose
overhead.
   Outside, a protester carried a sign that read ``Just Say No.
Keep Our City Clean'' and said he didn't want the Bakkers in
Orlando.
   ``I think it's so wrong,'' said Frankie Skinner, 23, of Orlando.
``They shouldn't get another chance.''
   Local officials raised another possible objection Monday,
announcing that the Bakkers had not applied for an occupational
license to operate their headquarters from the shopping center, and
ordering building inspectors to visit the shopping center today.
   Yet Bakker said before the program that he was satisfied with
the move to the Shoppers World mall, which is located outside
Orlando.
   ``Orlando seems like it's the crossroads of the world,'' Bakker
told reporters. ``The thing I like about it is, it's a place where
it seems like everyone is welcome.''
   The only other tenants at the 90,000-square-foot strip mall are
a Far East import store and two bars, including Nasty Ed's Pub,
where the clientele squinted through windows to see their new
neighbors.
   The Bakkers came to Florida after running into zoning problems
while taping their program at a rented home near Charlotte, N.C.
   Bakker, 49, is awaiting a federal trial on 24 counts of fraud
and conspiracy. The former head of the PTL television ministry is
charged with stealing millions of dollars from the organization he
founded.
   Bakker was ousted in 1987 following revelations that he had a
sexual tryst with church secretary Jessica Hahn and paid her with
ministry money to keep quiet.

<TEXT>
   ``Night Stalker'' defendant Richard Ramirez
snarled at reporters covering his serial murder trial, calling them
``sensation-seeking parasites.''
   Monday's outburst came after he emerged from a conference in the
chambers of Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan about whether
defense lawyers would present evidence in his behalf. The
prosecution already has rested its case.
   Tynan gave Ramirez' lawyers an extra day to decide whether to
call witnesses, or rest their case without presenting evidence.
   The tall, shaggy-haired Ramirez had made no public statements
since he said ``Hail Satan!'' and flashed a pentagram drawn on his
palm at his arraignment nearly four years ago.
   As Ramirez was being led back to his holding cell with shackles
rattling around his ankles, he turned toward the courtroom
spectator section where reporters were taking notes.
   ``Media!'' he growled in a loud, gravelly voice,
``Sensation-seeking parasites!''
   The 29-year-old drifter from El Paso, Texas, is charged with 13
murders and 30 related felonies in Los Angeles County during a
series of nighttime attacks that terrified the state in the summer
of 1985.
   Authorities said pentagrams _ upside-down five-pointed stars in
circles used to symbolize Satan _ were found at some murder scenes.
One victim's eyes were gouged out; a woman testified that her
attacker raped and sodomized her and made her ``swear to Satan'' as
she lay beside her slain husband.
   Ramirez was arrested on Labor Day weekend 1985 after a mob
recognized him, ran him down and beat him as he tried to steal a
car, authorities said.
   Since testimony began in his trial Jan. 30, six survivors of
``Night Stalker'' attacks have identified Ramirez as their
assailant. A total of 138 witnesses have testified against him.
   Ramirez's lawyers had said he was emotionally distraught last
week and wanted no defense because he felt it would do no good.
   ``We're still talking to our client. There are many things we
have to consider overnight,'' defense attorney Daniel Hernandez
told reporters as he left the courthouse Monday.

<HEAD>Main Opposition Parties Each Get A New Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of Australia's two main
opposition parties were simultaneously dumped today in party room
coups that could reshape the country's conservative political camp.
   The backroom maneuvering changed the leadership of the Liberal
and National parties, which in coalition dominated Australia's
postwar government until Prime Minister Bob Hawke's Labor Party won
parliamentary elections in 1983.
   The Liberal Party restored its old leader Andrew Peacock in
place of John Howard and the Nationals, the junior opposition
partner, deposing Ian Sinclair for Charles Blunt.
   ``The people who mounted the coups smell the scent of
government,'' said Michelle Gratton, respected political
commentator for The Age newspaper in Melbourne. ``They are
embarking on a ruthless exercise to try to ensure that the
opportunity of the next election is not lost.''
   The change had been brewing since the last federal election in
July 1987 that gave Hawke's government a record third straight
victory, with 86 seats in the 148 seat House of Representatives.
   Howard, as opposition coalition leader, had been widely viewed
as bungling the coalition's chances of victory after miscalculating
in a tax reform proposal.
   Ballots for the new positions were called unexpectedly Monday
night, and Howard was clearly surprised by the challenge.
   As he entered the federal Parliament today, Howard declared that
his political career was not in jeopardy: ``I have the numbers. I
will not resign.''
   Peacock, a former foreign minister, led the Liberals when they
lost the 1983 election. Howard ousted Peacock as party leader in
1985 and on Tuesday Peacock got his old job back, winning the
ballot by 44 votes to 27.
   Perhaps more significant was Sinclair's ousting as National
Party leader. The position had never before been challenged.
   Unlike Peacock's well-orchestrated effort, Blunt's run for the
National crown was sudden. Several others entered the fray but he
received the numbers. Blunt had been the party's aviation and
transport minister. The National Party vote was kept secret.
   In coalition, the Liberals and Nationals have governed Australia
for most of the past 40 years, barring the last six under Hawke's
centrist labor government. Hawke is regarded as the country's most
popular leader ever but his party _ which has embarked on radical
economic reform _ is not.
   Peacock and Howard are both 50, but Howard has often been
ridiculed by Labor politicians as ``tired old John''. Peacock is
known as the father of the Liberal Party, having entered the
political arena in 1966.
   Sinclair, the ousted National leader, is 59. His successor,
Blunt, is 38.
   But Hawke, in his only comment on today's opposition
maneuvering, told Labor stalwarts that he does not intend to call
early elections. The next federal balloting is scheduled for May
1990.
   Under Howard, the Liberal Party had undergone a marked shift to
the right and public opinion polls had consistently shown the
Liberal-National coalition under Howard as being unlikely to
successfully contest a federal election.

<TEXT>
   An unending assault by vandals has put a
statue of Myrna Loy behind bars.
   The statue depicting the goddess Venus rising from the sea has
been struck by vandals at least a dozen times during the past
decade. Artist William Van Orden is in the process of restoring it
_ again.
   A protective iron cage with three heavy locks has been built
around the statue at Venice High School to prevent another attack.
The most recent damage was discovered in February.
   ``It's the imprisonment of Myrna,'' said the 66-year-old artist,
who lives in Venice and has restored the statue after each attack.
``Something is wrong with society when we find ourselves locking up
our art to preserve it.
   ``We used to put only criminals behind bars, now we live behind
bars. The statue is a symbol of the school and, you know, the bars
are a symbol to what we have become.''
   Principal Andrea Natker said the cage was the only way to
protect the 7-foot-tall statue, originally sculpted in the 1920s by
former Venice High art teacher Harry Winebrenner.
   The $1,500 for the iron cage was donated by New York producers
of a planned musical based on the lighthearted mystery film ``The
Thin Man,'' starring Miss Loy and William Powell.

<HEAD>Book on Hiding People Found in Parents' Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A book explaining how to hide a person has
been found in the home of a couple suspected in the deaths of their
baby daughters in similar circumstances three years apart,
authorities say.
   ``The Stash Book'' was among the items taken by police from the
Alton home of Robert and Paula Sims, according to documents filed
Monday in Madison County Circuit Court.
   The Simses' 6-week-old daughter, Heather Lee, was found dead of
suffocation Wednesday night in a trash can on the Missouri side of
the Mississippi River _ four days after the couple reported her
abducted.
   The couple also had reported their first daughter, 13-day-old
Loralei, was abducted on June 17, 1986. Authorities said the
remains of a baby believed to be Loralei were found a week later
near the couple's home, then in nearby Brighton, just to the
northeast of St. Louis.
   In both cases, Mrs. Sims said her daughter was kidnapped by an
armed, masked gunman while her husband was at work, authorities
said. The case of Loralei Sims was never solved, although the
Simses remain suspects, Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom said.
   Sgt. Rick McCain, chief of detectives in Alton, said the seized
book dealt with hiding different kinds of items and included ``one
section on hiding a person.'' He said the section explained how to
build a false wall that someone could live behind in a home.
   Asked how the book might relate to the case, McCain said,
``Because the body might have been hidden.''
   Police have said tests showed Heather's body had been frozen
before it was dumped. Investigators said they found hairs in the
bottom of the freezer at the home of Mrs. Sims' parents, Orville
and Nylene Blew of Cottage Hills.
   Police in Alton asked the Simses again Monday for more
information about the deaths, but the Simses declined, police said.
   ``If they have a story to tell, we're here to listen,'' McCain
said. ``I think I've made it fairly clear that we want to talk to
them. If not, we'll go on with our case as it is.''
   On Monday, the couple's attorney told police the Simses would
not submit to polygraph tests, McCain said. But he said he believed
Heather's killing would be solved even if the Simses don't provide
more information.
   McCain said Robert Sims told police last week he doubted his
wife's stories about the abductions. The 37-year-old Sims told
police he believed his wife might have killed their daughters
accidentally, McCain said.
   Mrs. Sims had been upset at not having had boys after she gave
birth to both her daughters, the officer said.
   Paula Sims, 29, has declined to talk with police.
   The state took custody of the couple's 15-month-old son, Randy,
on Friday.
   The Simses met for about an hour Monday with their attorney,
Donald E. Groshong. The couple declined to comment afterward and
Groshong said much of what police have said ``isn't even worth
commenting on.''

   Japan has formally asked the United States to
explain a 1965 accident in which a U.S. carrier lost a hydrogen
bomb in the Pacific near a Japanese island while bound for a
Japanese port, officials said Tuesday.
   ``This happened in international waters so we have no right to
make a loud demand,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official who
declined to be named. ``We are just asking the United States to
give us an explanation.''
   Japanese opposition politicians and citizens' groups claim the
U.S. government covered up the accident. Japan is the only country
ever attacked with nuclear weapons, and popular sentiment is
strongly against nuclear arms.
   The bomb was aboard an A-4 Skyhawk jet that fell off the carrier
Ticonderoga about 80 miles from a small island in Japan's Ryukyu
chain and 200 miles east of the heavily populated island of
Okinawa, a U.S. military spokesman in Japan said.
   The carrier was on its way from Vietnam to the Japanese port of
Yokosuka and the plane's pilot was killed in the accident.
   After a report in the current issue of Newsweek magazine raised
the issue, Japan asked Monday for a U.S. explanation.
   ``We are interested and concerned (about the details),'' the
Foreign Ministry official said.
   Other officials said Japan's government does not know the
location and condition of the B-43 bomb, and there had been no
discussions with the United States about how to deal with it.
   The magazine report, quoting nuclear expert William Arkin of the
Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies, said the U.S. Navy
kept the incident secret until a 1981 Pentagon report that listed
accidents involving nuclear weapons.
   But at the time of the 1981 report, the United States ``did not
bring it to our attention,'' said the Foreign Ministry official.
The report said only that the accident occurred 500 miles from the
Asian mainland.
   Arkin said there was scant danger the bomb would detonate,
although the 33 pounds of plutonium in the bomb could threaten the
environment as it deteriorates.
   The Ticonderoga was on a mission that included readiness to
launch a nuclear strike, a declassified U.S. Navy document released
by Arkin and the environmental group Greenpeace said.
   The disclosure raised the possibility that the carrier entered
Yokosuka with nuclear arms, despite Japan's ban on nuclear weapons.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that U.S. ships still transit
Japan with nuclear weapons aboard,'' Arkin said in Washington on
Monday.
   The Navy declined comment on Arkin's findings.
   Opposition parties and citizens have charged that Navy ships
routinely visit Japanese ports carrying nuclear bombs with the
tacit agreement of the Japanese government.
   Japan has said the United States is not permitted to bring in
nuclear weapons without prior consultations, and there have been no
such consulations.
   The United States refuses to confirm or deny the presence of
nuclear weapons in specific locations.
   The lost one-megaton hydrogen bomb was about 70 times as
powerful as the bomb that fell on the port city of Hiroshima in
August 1945 in the closing days of World War II, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   Disclosure of the 1965 accident has stirred the ire of citizens
on Okinawa, the site of one of the bloodiest battles in World War
II, and the continued presence of some 35,000 U.S. troops has led
to tensions and frequent protests over such problems as target
range accidents.
   Leaders of Okinawan citizens groups protesting nuclear arms
denounced the way the incident has been handled, news reports said.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who dominated
Louisiana politics for nearly two decades but was dogged by
racketeering charges in his last term, said he will run for an
unprecedented fourth term in 1991.
   His announcement Monday came little more than one week after
voters defeated Gov. Buddy Roemer's tax revision package, which
some political analysts called a referendum on the governor's
political strength.
   ``I can tell you that Buddy Roemer will not be the next
governor, so I decided to make the run,'' said Edwards, 61, looking
fit and tanned during a brief visit to the Capitol.
   Jeff Cowart, a spokesman for Roemer, said, ``We normally don't
respond to Edwin's fantasies.''
   Edwards ran second to Roemer in the 1987 primary and then
dropped out of a runoff.
   Edwards served two four-year terms in the 1970s and was barred
by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term.
   In 1983, he became the first governor elected three times by
defeating Dave Treen, the state's first Republican governor since
Reconstruction.
   That term was marked by Edwards' trial and acquittal on federal
racketeering charges and the collapse of oil prices that threw the
state into a deep recession.
   Edwards said he would establish a campaign office ``in about a
year.'' He promised to revive his 1987 campaign theme _ creation of
a state lottery and casino gambling for New Orleans.
   Roemer opposed the lottery and new taxes and vowed to reduce the
budget.
   Nearly two dozen lottery bills have been filed in the
Legislature as lawmakers look for new revenue to meet a projected
$700 million deficit for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
   ``A lottery and casino gambling are the only answers in these
economic times. There are some long-range things that can be done
but the state needs something sooner, and not taxes on the backs of
the people,'' Edwards said.
   He said Roemer doomed himself by making ``irresponsible campaign
promises inconsistent with reality and now he must retreat. He
admits he can't solve all of the problems by scrubbing the budget.''
   In his first year in office, Roemer pushed through sales tax
increases and borrowed $1 billion to retire an accumulated deficit.
   His tax package, which was rejected by 55 percent to 45 percent,
would have reduced business taxes and sales taxes and increased
individual income taxes. Roemer said the package was necessary to
create jobs and reduce the state's dependence on the oil industry.

   U.S. naval vessels are transporting nuclear
weapons across Japanese territorial waters even though Japan
forbids ``introduction'' of such loads, a researcher says.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that U.S. ships still transit
Japan with nuclear weapons aboard,'' researcher William Arkin of
the liberal Institute for Policy Studies said Monday in an
interview.
   Arkin made the comment after releasing evidence about a 1965
accident in which the Navy lost a bomb-bearing aircraft and its
pilot 80 miles off Japan's Okinawa island chain.
   Japan on Monday formally requested an explanation from
Washington about the 1965 accident.
   ``This happened in international waters so we have no right to
make a loud demand,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official who
declined to be named. ``We are just asking the United States to
give us an explanation.''
   The research Arkin did with the environmentalist Greenpeace
group concluded that the United States and Soviet Union have
littered the ocean floor with at least 48 nuclear weapons and 11
nuclear reactors.
   Two days after the airplane fell off the elevator of the USS
Ticonderoga, the aircraft carrier docked at the Japanese port of
Yokosuka, Arkin said.
   Arkin asserted Monday the United States sidesteps the Japanese
ban by arguing a temporary transit or port call by a ship does not
amount to the ``introduction'' of nuclear weapons.
   A Japanese Embassy official in Washington said Monday on
condition of anonymity: ``It is our understanding that we would
receive prior consultation with the United States before U.S.
forces bring nuclear weapons to Japan. So if there has been no
consultation, we assume there has been no introduction of nuclear
weapons.''
   The Navy declined comment on the findings, saying it refuses to
confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons in specific
locations.
   Arkin and Joshua Handler, a Greenpeace member who helped prepare
the report, said their research showed a different version of
events from the one given by the Navy in 1981 when it disclosed the
incident.
   The Navy said in a statement then that the incident took place
``more than 500 miles from land ... at sea in the Pacific.''
   Arkin and Handler said log books kept by deck officers showed
that the accident occurred in international waters about 80 miles
from the closest point of the Okinawa island chain and only about
200 miles east of the heavily populated island of Okinawa.
   The accident is considered by the Navy to be one of its two most
severe mishaps involving nuclear devices. The second such ``Broken
Arrow,'' as the incidents are called, was the 1968 loss of the
submarine Scorpion in the Atlantic.
   At the time of the Ticonderoga accident, Okinawa was under U.S.
control. It was returned to Japan in 1972, 27 years after Japan's
defeat in World War II in which atomic bombs were dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   The ship had been returning from bombing missions off the coast
of Vietnam. Although only conventional bombs were used in Vietnam,
a newly declassified memo obtained by Arkin said the Ticonderoga at
the time was to have ``the capability to launch a nuclear strike
when and where directed by the president.''
   Arkin said there was little danger of detonation from the
one-megaton bomb, which has a force of one million tons of TNT,
although he said the 15 kilograms of plutonium in the bomb could
threaten the environment as it deteriorates over time.
   ``Over time, the pressure, water circulation and corrosion are
likely to lead to the release of radioactivity,'' he said.
   The Japanese government does not know the present location and
condition of the bomb and there have been no discussions with the
United States about how to deal with it, sai a Japanese Foreign
Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Most of the warheads and reactors lost at sea belonged to the
Soviet Union, according to Greenpeace data.
   The most recent Soviet loss was a Mike class submarine with two
nuclear reactors aboard off the coast of Norway that sank April 7,
said Handler.
   The most serious loss was a Soviet Yankee class submarine that
sank Oct. 6, 1986, off the coast of Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean.
Yankee-class subs are believed to carry 16 SS-N-6 ballistic
missiles, with two warheads apiece, and to be powered by two
nuclear reactors, according to Western defense analysts.
   The report, which first came out over the weekend, was
prominently featured in Japanese newspapers and on television.
Leaders of anti-war and anti-nuclear groups and opponents of the
U.S. military presence on Okinawa immediately issued denunciations.

   The dollar strengthened in early European trading
today. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar, which weathered
reported Bank of Japan intervention earlier in the day, had a
clearly bullish undertone.
   Many expected European central banks to step into the market to
halt the dollar's rise, but were divided on whether it would work.
   ``If the central banks intervene massively, it might have an
impact,'' said one trader at a large West German bank in Frankfurt.
   But another said, ``Intervention hasn't been successful, and I
doubt it will be today.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.48 yen to a closing 135.00. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 134.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _2.0000 West German marks, up from 1.8975
   _1.7010 Swiss francs, up from 1.6945
   _6.4408 French francs, up from 6.4025
   _2.1528 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1400
   _1,392.75 Italian lire, up from 1,385.00
   _1.1865 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1850
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6658, cheaper for buyers
than $1.6710 Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $376.20 a troy ounce,
down from $377.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $376.00.

   A man who claimed to be an astronaut pleaded
guilty to using his wife's company-issued credit card to charter a
jet. He was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation as part of
his sentence.
   Robert Hunt, 27, also was sentenced Monday to three months and
12 days in the Suffolk County House of Correction, the time he has
already served in the jail since his arrest Jan. 28.
   Municipal Court Judge Herbert Hershfang also ordered Hunt to pay
the air charter company $5,994. He chartered a jet last summer to
fly with his wife to Montreal, charging it on her credit card while
telling her the flight cost nothing because he was a space shuttle
pilot, authorities said.
   Hunt's plea was part of an agreement with the district
attorney's office. Hunt was placed on probation for one year and
ordered to complete any program ordered by a court psychiatrist.
   Authorities said Hunt has posed as an astronaut, Marine captain,
jet pilot and building contractor.
   He reportedly posed as an astronaut in a brief meeting with
Benjamin Briscoe, Dublin's lord mayor, while in Ireland. He also is
reported to have lectured aviation buffs in Bedford and to have
given friends and relatives burned kitchen tiles, saying they came
from the wreck of the space shuttle Challenger.
   Hunt was released Monday but faces a charge in Lynn District
Court of swindling a family out of $4,000 on the promise he could
get their 18-year-old son out of the Navy.

<HEAD>Party Leadership Strips Kadar of His Last Posts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders have stripped
former longtime party boss Janos Kadar of his last posts, saying
the man who took over when the Soviets crushed a 1956 popular
revolt is too ill to carry on.
   The 76-year-old Kadar, replaced as Hungary's leader last year,
was stripped by the party's governing Central Committee Monday of
the post of honorary party president and his seat on the committee.
   The state news agency MTI said Kadar was retired ``on the basis
of information received'' about his state of health.
   But the action followed disclosure of Kadar's role in past
political repressions and increasing public criticism of his
failure to keep pushing reforms during his 32 years in power.
   MTI said the Central Committee ``addressed a written message''
to Kadar, indicating he did not attend Monday's meeting, and that
its contents would be published later.
   Kadar had been replaced as party chief by Karoly Grosz, who is
leading a slow transition to the politics of competing parties and
who criticized the role Kadar played after Soviet forces crushed
the 1956 popular revolt.
   Kadar, who last month was said by officials to be so ill that he
could not carry out his duties, has been seen rarely in public
since losing the party to Grosz last May.
   That shift ushered in a time of fast-paced reforms, with
Communists who advocate greater democracy gradually gaining
strength.
   Such party members have made it clear that they viewed Kadar's
removal from all party posts as a step to gaining trust and
confidence with the public before elections next year, the first
multiparty balloting in four decades.
   Politburo member Mihaly Jasso gave the first public hint that
Kadar would be relieved of his last posts when he told a Budapest
newspaper Sunday that Kadar was ``very ill'' but refused to leave
for treatment at a Soviet health spa in the Crimea.
   Kadar's role in repressions while interior minister after the
Communist takeover in 1948 and in the bloody end of the anti-Soviet
revolt in 1956 have come under increasing public criticism recently.
   The government daily Magyar Hirlap on Saturday published a
full-page document from July 1956 authored by Mihaly Farkas, the
No. 3 figure in the Communist leadership before the revolt that
year.
   The document disclosed that Kadar, then head of the Interior
Ministry, approved of the beating of Laszlo Rajk, a leading
Communist accused of treason and executed in a 1949 purge.
   At a meeting of top historians last week, academician Maria
Ormos called for the leadership to make public other documents she
claims may show Kadar had a part in the capture, imprisonment and
execution of Imre Nagy, leader of the short-lived 1956 revolt.
   Kadar's role at the end of the revolt has never been fully
explained.
   As Kadar's political star waned, Nagy's rose. Executed in 1958
and buried with other leaders of the revolt in an anonymous, remote
corner of a Budapest cemetery, Nagy is to be reburied next month in
a marked grave in the same spot.
   Tens of thousands of Hungarians are expected to attend the
funeral. A new book about Nagy and lapel pins with his portrait are
selling fast at Budapest kiosks.
   Once shunned by the West for taking over after the revolt, Kadar
had slowly gained respect abroad and at home by ushering in
economic reforms in the 1960s.
   But reform was halted in the 1970s. Unwise borrowing eventually
led to economic stagnation and the highest per capita debt in the
East bloc.

   A car bomb explosion believed
triggered by Basque separatists killed two policemen and injured
three after a shooting incident apparently aimed at luring police,
authorities said today.
   In a statement, the ministry said the blast occurred Monday
night outside a maximum security prison in this city just east of
Madrid about 10 minutes after gunmen shot a prison employee as he
drove away from the facility.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but police said
it appeared to have been carried out by the Basque separatist
organization ETA.
   At least 40 ETA members convicted of terrorist-related crimes
are serving sentences at the prison, known as Alcala-Meco.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region. During its 21-year campaign of violence,
the group has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600
people, mainly police and paramilitary Civil Guard officers.
   The Interior Ministry said the attack outside the prison began
when gunmen shot at the employee's car, causing the man to lose
control of the vehicle in a field and flee on foot while still
under fire.
   Minutes later, a police van carrying 12 officers left the prison
for Madrid accompanied by other police officers in private cars.
   They spotted the employee waving for them to stop and his
abandoned car with its lights on and doors open, the ministry said.
   Several policemen rescued the prison employee, while five
officers proceeded to inspect the man's abandoned car, the ministry
said.
   During the inspection, a bomb placed in the car's rear seats
exploded, killing two police officers and slightly injuring three
others, the ministry said.
   The prison employee received two bullet wounds in the back and
was listed in serious condition following surgery, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   The deaths come a little more than a month after ETA called off
its moratorium on attacks against government targets when peace
talks between exiled ETA leaders and Spanish officials collapsed.
   Early today, two bombs exploded at separate car dealerships of
the French company Renault in the Basque city of Bilbao and a third
bomb ripped through a Renault dealership in the Basque town of
Zarauz, police said.
   The blasts damaged several cars on display and shattered windows
in parked cars and adjacent buildings, but caused no serious
injuries, police said. No group claimed the bombings, police said.
   Also today, officials of the state-owned RENFE railroad
suspended services between the northern cities of Miranda de Ebro
and Castejon after a phone caller identifying himself as an ETA
member told Red Cross officials the group had planted a bomb on
tracks there.

<HEAD>Shamir: Rejection of Palestinian State Before Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in an
interview published today that Palestinians who run in his proposed
elections must agree that the occupied lands will not become an
independent Palestinian nation.
   Shamir told the Jerusalem Post the agreement would apply to an
interim period of autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to
negotiations on the final status of the territories, seized by
Israel in 1967.
   ``Agreement has to be for the whole process,'' he said.
   Shamir has suggested previously that he might ask for such an
agreement before elections can be held. But his interview with the
Post is his most wide-ranging statement on his plan.
   Leading Palestinians in the occupied lands and the Palestine
Liberation Organization have said any elections must be part of a
plan leading to Palestinian independence.
   They have turned down Shamir's proposal, but he has said he does
not consider the rejection final.
   Under his proposal, Palestinians in the occupied lands would
elect people to negotiate with Israel on a five-year autonomy plan.
Talks on the final status of the territories would begin in the
third year.
   Shamir said he wanted agreement with a ``Palestinian body''
before the balloting to ensure that those elected would not
``proclaim themselves the government of Palestine, or something
like that.''
   He did not make clear what ``body'' he had in mind but repeated
his government's refusal to negotiate with the PLO, which Israel
considers a terrorist organization.
   ``It will have to be a Palestinian body. Perhaps if Egypt and
Jordan will want to join, we will welcome them,'' Shamir said. The
West Bank was captured from Jordan, the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
   Today is Memorial Day in honor of Israel's war dead. In a speech
in observance of the day, Shamir said the creation of a Palestinian
state was out of the question because it would bring a
``Beirut-like situation in the very midst of our country.''
   ``The reality of the Middle East is that we must be a strong
nation,'' he told the United Israel Appeal, a group of Jews from
around the world.
   ``First strength, then peace,'' Shamir said.
   He told the Post that for elections to take place, Israel also
must convince Palestinians that it can crush the 17-month uprising
against Israeli occupation.
   The uprising, in which 465 Palestinians and 21 Israelis have
been killed, is seen in the occupied lands as the reason why
sympathy with the Palestinian cause has grown around the world.
   Shamir also said he would oppose having international observers
for the elections, as suggested by some Palestinians.
   ``We are sure if we proclaim general, free and democratic
elections, then that's the way it will be,'' he said.

   The little girl who survived a killing
spree that claimed her mother and two sisters is behaving like any
3-year-old, pouting and playing with lots of donated toys, her
doctor says.
   Dr. Ralph Keill said Carmina Salcido is recovering very well
from the slash in her throat, allegedly inflicted by her own
father. She should be discharged from Petaluma Valley Hospital
within two weeks, he said.
   ``She plays. She pouts. She has temper tantrums,'' Keill said
Monday at a news conference outside the hospital about 30 miles
north of San Francisco.
   Ramon Salcido, 28, entered innocent pleas to seven counts of
murder and three charges of attempted murder last Friday. He is
accused of killing his wife, two daughters, his mother-in-law and
her two daughters and a co-worker at the winery where he worked.
   Salcido allegedly slit Carmina's throat and left her for dead
alongside the bodies of her two sisters, Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1,
at a trash dump in Sonoma County last month.
   Carmina, now listed in good condition, has been talking in a
whisper.
   ``It sounds pretty good to us,'' said hospital spokeswoman Mary
Frost.
   Carmina has been allowed outside the hospital for walks and
rides on her new tricycle and went on an outing with her
grandfather, Robert Richards.
   Richards has petitioned the court for custody of Carmina.
   ``Carmina loves stickers,'' Frost said. ``She puts them up on
the walls of her hospital room, on her nurse's lapels, wherever she
wants to stick one.''
   Salcido was captured in Mexico on April 19, five days after the
rampage, and deported to California. He remains in solitary
confinement in the Sonoma County Jail.

<HEAD>Borden Dairy Products Recalled for Fear of Contamination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. removed milk and other dairy
products from stores in Louisiana and Mississippi for fear they
might be contaminated, but officials in both states said they
believed there was no health threat.
   Borden, the world's largest dairy company, pulled the products
off store shelves Monday in north Louisiana and throughout
Mississippi after learning that milk from 32 northwest Louisiana
and east Texas dairies might contain traces of a barium substance
used in rat poison.
   However, Gwen Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana
Department of Health and Hospitals, said officials believed no milk
containing dangerous amounts of barium carbonate got as far as
store shelves.
   ``The bottom line is, there is not and has not been any
contaminated milk on the market,'' she said.
   Dr. Ed Thompson of the Mississippi Department of Health said the
traces of barium carbonate found in Mississippi were too small to
be dangerous.
   ``There's just not a significant health risk involved,''
Thompson said in Jackson, Miss.
   Ms. Stewart said some milk with traces of barium was allowed on
the market, but it was considered an acceptable level _ less than
half that allowed in drinking water.
   There were no reports of illness stemming from contaminated milk.
   Deaths of cattle at an east Texas dairy farm on April 22 and a
Louisiana dairy farm on April 24 led officials in those states to
withhold milk produced at those farms, Ms. Stewart said.
   A check with a Purina feed mill in Shreveport revealed that feed
used by the two farms had been carried in a rail car that had been
used to carry barium carbonate.
   Barium carbonate is a white powder used in rat poison and in a
variety of processes, including manufacture of some kinds of glass
and ceramics, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management
Agency. It is toxic if swallowed.
   Ms. Stewart said frozen milk samples revealed the presence of
barium _ from two parts per million to five parts per million.
   She said there are no standards set for barium in milk. However,
she and Borden spokeswoman Chris Tilton said government standards
for water limit barium to one part per million.
   Ms. Tilton, contacted at Borden's headquarters in Columbus,
Ohio, said the company did not know whether any of the milk, ice
cream and other products it distributed to stores was contaminated,
but decided to withdraw them after learning Louisiana tests
detected barium.

   The Bush administration faces ``the
congressional equivalent of World War III'' if it retaliates
against a top NASA scientist who said the Office of Management and
Budget doctored his testimony on global warming, a Senate panel
chairman says.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, meantime, called the
practice of alterations routine and said changes were made by a
budget official ``four or five levels down from the top.''
   Dr. James Hansen on Monday told senators that OMB forced him to
contradict within his own prepared statement his finding that a
buildup of ``greenhouse effect'' gases would increase the
likelihood of drought.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. praised Hansen for speaking out at the
Senate hearing and warned that if administration officials
``attempt any kind of retribution in return for candor, they will
have on their hands the congressional equivalent of World War III.''
   Gore said this morning on NBC's ``Today'' program that he
questioned President Bush's commitment to the environment, saying
pro-environmentalists in his administration were outnumbered by
others who were pushing a ``do-nothing policy'' on global warming.
   ``We should be leading instead of just dragging our feet, and
that's the fault of the president of the United States,'' Gore said.
   He said the change in Hansen's testimony ``was an exercise in
science fraud in the sense that they tried to mislead the Congress
into believing that the scientific evidence was not yet good enough
to justify conclusions about the need for action on the greenhouse
effect.''
   But Fitzwater said the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration scientist was free to express his own views in
answering committee questions.
   ``He's never been muzzled,'' the spokesman insisted. ``He's free
to say whatever he wants.''
   In testimony before Gore's science subcommittee of the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Hansen said he
wouldn't object to a policy review by OMB. But he added: ``I don't
believe the scientific aspects in testimony should be altered. I
did try to get them to compromise. ... I was not successful.''
   Fitzwater said scientists inside and outside the government
disagree on the global warming issue. He complained that Hansen's
original testimony gave the appearance that ``there was unanimity
within the government on this matter. We simply wanted to point out
that there wasn't.
   ``We thought we were commenting on policy, not scientific
evidence,'' Fitzwater said.
   Hansen complained about the alterations during his response to
Gore's questions about the changes following submission of the
toned-down written statement.
   In the document, Hansen said it was unlikely scientists would
alter the conclusions of computer models that greenhouse gases
would increase drought in low and middle latitudes. But the
statement also contradicted the conclusion by saying _ in language
inserted by OMB _ that the computer models were not reliable.
   Hansen said officials also added a sentence that said it was
unknown whether the buildup of greenhouse gases was from natural
forces or from human activities. Hansen and others at the hearing
said humans were primarily responsible by burning fossil fuel,
cutting down tropical rain forests and other actions.
   ``Every scientist that testified here today ... and every
reputable scientist in the field supports your conclusion this is
primarily a human cause. It's not an act of God. OMB forced you to
say it may ... be just the forces of nature,'' Gore said.
   ``They're acting as if they're scared of the truth,'' the
senator added. ``It's a form of scientific fraud by them. ... The
administration does not want to act. It wants to sit still and do
nothing.''
   The development came two days after it became known that the
White House had rebuffed the suggestions of William Reilly, head of
the Environmental Protection Agency, and other officials that the
U.S. government call for an international convention on global
warming.
   Another government scientist, Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he had a
similar experience with the budget office in congressional
testimony he prepared in February.
   Mahlman said he successfully fought changes that would have been
``embarrassing to me'' in facing his fellow scientists, and told
senators, ``If we do not have the right to be wrong, we have
squelched the right to be creative.''
   The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earth's
atmosphere trap radiant heat near the planet's surface. In addition
to natural buildup, the gases have increased dramatically because
of burning coal, oil, and gas, as well as the destruction of
tropical rain forests.

   The woman police call the ``godmother'' of a
drug smuggling cult that killed 15 people said she was held hostage
by group members after the ritual slayings were discovered.
   Sara Aldrete Villarreal said on Monday she belonged to the cult
and described its leader as ``enigmatic and mysterious.'' But she
again denied any role in the mutilation slayings at a ranch in
Matamoros near the U.S. border.
   ``I have never in my life participated in a human sacrifice,''
the 24-year-old woman said at a news conference. ``I am sorry
because of all the things that happened, I'm sorry because of all
the killing.''
   ``I don't know how I got into this without knowing what it
was,'' she said.
   Mexican authorities said Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and Ms.
Aldrete, a former honor student at Texas Southmost College in
Brownsville, directed the human sacrifices and other rituals,
including mutilations and boiling of brains and organs. Authorities
said the rituals were meant to bring occult protection to the drug
ring, which allegedly trafficked in marijuana to the United States.
   Ms. Aldrete and four other people were arrested at a Mexico City
apartment Saturday after a gunfight with police.
   Constanzo, 26, and his right-hand man, Martin Quintana
Rodriguez, were killed. Alvaro de Leon Valdez, 22, one of those
arrested, said he shot the two to death on Constanzo's orders.
   Ms. Aldrete said on Monday that she was watching television with
Constanzo, known as the cult's ``godfather,'' at a Mexico City
apartment on April 12 when she learned of the killings.
   ``He said, `They've found the bodies, we have to leave,''' Ms.
Aldrete said. ``I said, `What are you talking about?' And he said,
`OK, you want to know, I'll tell you.' And he told me how he did it
and why.''
   De Leon Valdez told reporters on Monday that Ms. Aldrete was not
involved in the killings, discovered April 11.
   At a news conference on Sunday he discussed the slayings and
said he watched earlier this year as Mark Kilroy, 21, a University
of Texas premedical student, was killed with a machete chop to the
head and his spinal column removed for a necklace.
   Ms. Aldrete said she, Constanzo and other cult members fled
briefly to Brownsville, just north of Matamoros, after police began
digging up the bodies of victims. ``Living in Brownsville, it was
like hell,'' she said. ``They treated me like a prisoner. I was
scared.''
   Ms. Aldrete said the group returned to Mexico City a few days
later and stayed in small towns near the capital.
   She said that several weeks ago the group moved into the
apartment in a quiet, middle-class Mexico City neighborhood where
police closed in Saturday.
   She did not describe how group members kept her from escaping or
from contacting authorities.
   Ms. Aldrete said she was fascinated with Constanzo ever since
she met him in June 1987. ``He would order you to do something and
you would do it, but I don't know why. He was like a leader or
something. We were like followers.''
   Aldrete said Constanzo initiated her into the Christian Santeria
cult last year. Santeria, an offshoot of voodoo, is a blend of
Catholicism and old African beliefs that include animal sacrifices.
   Ms. Aldrete and the others arrested on Saturday were booked on
charges including homicide and criminal association.

   Earthquakes that shook Yunnan province in
southwest China over the weekend left at least one person dead,
injured as many as 91 people and destroyed about 5,000 homes,
official media reported today.
   The earthquakes, the strongest measuring 6.3 on the Richter
scale Sunday in the mountainous areas of Gengma county, also
damaged 17 reservoirs, five power stations and 110 miles of roads,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. About 575 acres of farmland
were ``severely affected'' by the quake.
   The quakes caused more than $54 million in damage, the report
said.
   Xinhua reported only 11 people injured, but the official
English-language China Daily, quoting the Yunnan Provincial
Ministry of Civil Affairs, said 91 were hurt in the quake,
including 20 who received serious injuries.
   A provincial ministry official reached by telephone from Beijing
refused to say how many people were injured.
   The quake-prone region near the Burmese border, which is largely
inhabated by members of the farming Va and Dai minorities, was
devasted in November by a temblor measuring 7.6 on the Richter
scale that killed 730 people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, and each increase of one number means the ground motion
is 10 times greater. A magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage in
populated areas while a magnitude 7 temblor is capable of
widespread, heavy damage.

   Two revues _ ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' and
``Black and Blue'' _ dominated the 1989 Tony nominations after a
theater season so weak that the musical categories for best book
and score were eliminated.
   Each show received 10 nominations Monday, including best
musical. They will compete against ``Starmites,'' a campy space-age
musical that got six nominations.
   The 1988-89 Broadway season was the poorest in quantity and
quality for musicals in several years. Only seven new musicals
opened, compared with 14 a year ago. Several shows, particularly
``Carrie'' and ``Legs Diamond,'' were spectacular flops.
   The decision by the nominating committee to eliminate the two
categories was unusual but not unprecedented. In 1985, nominations
for actor and actress in a musical and for choreography were
dropped. ``Black and Blue'' and ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' use
old songs and have no book.
   ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' a farce by Ken Ludwig about an indisposed
opera star and the nebbish who replaces him, garnered seven
nominations, including best play. Its best-play competition
includes Wendy Wasserstein's ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' winner of
the 1989 Pulitzer Prize; ``Shirley Valentine,'' Willy Russell's
comedy about an unfulfilled English housewife, and ``Largely New
York,'' Bill Irwin's play without dialogue that picked up four
other nominations.
   Irwin also was nominated for best acting in the play, for
direction and for choreography, which he did with Kimi Okada.
   Other best actor nominations went to dance superstar Mikhail
Baryshnikov for his portrayal of man who turns into a dung beetle
in ``Metamorphosis,'' and to Philip Bosco and Victor Garber for
``Lend Me a Tenor.''
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' picked up multiple nominations in
two categories. Jason Alexander and Robert La Fosse were nominated
for best actor in a musical and Jane Lanier, Faith Prince and
Debbie Shapiro were chosen in the featured actress in a musical
category.
   Besides Robbins' nod for best director of a musical, the show,
which features numbers from some of his greatest works, also got
nominations for Charlotte d'Amboise (actress in a musical), Scott
Wise (featured actor in a musical), Jennifer Tipton (lighting
design).
   ``Black and Blue,'' a tap dancing and blues revue, received
nominations for its stars, Ruth Brown and Linda Hopkins (actress in
a musical), for two of its featured performers, Bunny Briggs and
Savion Glover; its lighting design, Neil Peter Jampolis and Jane
Reisman, and its choreography, by Cholly Atkins, Henry LeTang,
Frankie Manning and Fayard Nicholas. The producers of ``Black and
Blue'' _ Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzoli _ were nominated for
two other awards _ lighting and direction of a musical.
   The nominees for best actress in a play were Joan Allen, ``The
Heidi Chronicles''; Pauline Collins, ``Shirley Valentine'';
Madeline Kahn, ``Born Yesterday''; and Kate Nelligan, ``Spoils of
War.''
   Irwin's competition for best director of a play includes Gregory
Mosher, ``Our Town''; Daniel Sullivan, ``The Heidi Chronicles,''
and Jerry Zaks, ``Lend Me a Tenor.''
   Best revival nominations went to ``Ah, Wilderness!'',``Ain't
Misbehavin','' ``Cafe Crown'' and ``Our Town.''
   A special Tony Award will be given to the Hartford Stage
Company, which was picked by the American Theater Critics
Association for the Tony for outstanding regional theater.
   Winners will be announced June 4 during a ceremony broadcast on
CBS-TV from the Gershwin Theater.

   The crew of a fishing boat apparently turned off
the refrigeration to thaw up to 16 tons of tuna, but the rotting
fish created a lethal gas that killed two of the men, a Coast Guard
investigator said.
   A cloud of hydrogen sulfide overcame the captain and the
engineer when they entered the hold, Lt. Cmdr. Phil Dyer said
Monday. A third crewman, Lawrence Moon of Micronesia, abandoned
ship in a life raft 300 hundred miles off Hawaii.
   The boat had left Samoa April 23 after failing to sell its catch
and sailed for Hawaii 2,300 miles away, Dyer said. After turning
off the refrigeration, crew members threw as much of the fish
overboard as they could, he said.
   When the odor forced the crew out of the hold, Dyer said, they
tried to wash the fish out, but the screens clogged. On April 30,
the captain went below to try to clear the screens, followed by the
engineer. Both died in the hold.
   The bodies of the captain, David James Dowie, and the engineer,
Martin Ferguson, both of Alaska, were removed from the vessel
Sunday after it was towed to Honolulu. Moon was picked up by a
Japanese vessel.
   Chemicals were pumped into the hold to neutralize the gas before
the vessel was allowed to enter port.

<HEAD>November 17 Claims Attack On Former Greek Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The November 17 terrorist group today
claimed responsibility for a bomb that wounded a former Socialist
Cabinet minister.
   The Marxist group said in a typewritten letter to the
Eleftherotypia newspaper that it sought to punish George Petsos for
his alleged involvement in a multimillion dollar financial scandal
rocking the Socialist government.
   November 17 said that Petsos ``insults and mocks the Greek
people under the protection of parliamentary immunity, since
neither justice nor Parliament can or wants to touch him.''
   The 42-year-old Socialist Party member was injured when a
booby-trapped car exploded next to his automobile on Monday as he
was being driven to his central Athens office. He was taken to a
hospital where doctors removed glass shards from his face and upper
body. His injuries were not serious. Two police officers escorting
Petsos were also slightly injured in the blast.
   Petsos was dropped from the Cabinet during a reshuffle in March
when Premier Andreas Papandreou tried to rid his government of
ministers accused of involvement in a $200 million swindle at the
Bank of Crete.
   The bank's former chairman, George Koskotas, fled the country in
November after being charged with fraud, forgery and embezzlement
and is being held in a Salem, Mass., jail pending a hearing for his
extradition to Greece.
   In interviews he has accused Papandreou and other senior
Socialist officials of taking kickbacks and being directly involved
in the scandal.
   The premier has denied the allegations, but eight Cabinet
members have either resigned or been fired because of the scandal,
including Papandreou's No. 2 two man, Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas.
Under Greek law parliamentarians have immunity from prosecution
while they remain deputies.
   ``We decided to execute the second in line after
Koutsogiorgas,'' the November 17 letter said. ``Unfortunately the
people's swindler and thief George Petsos was very lucky.''
   The elusive urban terrorist group has claimed 13 killings and
numerous bombings in the past 13 years. Its victims have included
three senior U.S. officials, several Greek businessmen, publishers
and police officers.
   The group first surfaced with the assassination of Athens CIA
station chief Richard Welch in 1975. It also claimed the killing in
June 1988 of U.S. Defense Attache William E. Nordeen in an attack
police descibed as ``practically identical'' to the one against
Petsos.
   November 17 is named after the day in 1973 when tanks and troops
crushed a student uprising against the 1967-74 military
dictatorship at the Athens Polytechnic University. None of its
members has ever been arrested. It aims to overthrow the state
through armed revolution and establish a Marxist regime.

   A 69-year-old former Army captain has been
placed on three years' probation and fined $10,000 for conspiring
to ship weapons to forces loyal to former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. on Monday also ordered
Leon Dicker to perform 600 hours of community service.
   Dicker pleaded guilty Monday, admitting he tried to make the
shipments in 1987, months before two coup attempts failed to return
Marcos to power.
   Dicker was convicted in 1987 and sentenced to four years in
prison, but a federal appeals court ruled that testimony was
improperly introduced and overturned the verdict.
   Gemmo Trinidad, Marcos' spokesman in Hawaii, said he had not
heard of the case and could not comment on it.
   Known as ``The General'' to his associates, Dicker was an Army
captain in World War II and is a disbarred Hewlett, N.Y., attorney.
He said he believed it would be in the United States' interest to
ship the arms to the Philippines.
   Marcos fled the Philippines Feb. 26, 1986, amid an uprising that
carried Corazon Aquino to power.
   Dicker was arrested in 1987 in a sting operation as he drove to
what he believed was a warehouse containing the weapons.
   The indictment said he conspired to ship M-60 machine guns and
Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns to Thailand. Dicker told the court
that Thailand was identified as a destination only to obtain an
export license.
   Federal law requires that arms exports be licensed by the State
Department.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Claudia J. Flynn said an investigation
was continuing in the case. She supported the judge's request for
no prison time, citing Dicker's cooperation with the investigation
and his age.

   Six sailors were killed and five were injured
today when fire broke out aboard a U.S. Navy combat supply ship in
the South China Sea, a Navy spokeswoman said.
   ``It appeared to be a fuel leak,'' the spokeswoman said,
declining to be further identified. The ship was identified as the
USS White Plains, which normally carries a crew of about 428
officers and enlisted men.
   The spokeswoman said the fire broke out at 2 a.m. EDT in the
main engine spaces ``while conducting operations'' at an
undetermined location in the South China Sea. She said the five
injured were evacuated by helicopter to the U.S.S. Sacramento.
   According to the authoritative reference work Jane's Fighting
Ships, the White Plains is 581 feet long and displaces 9.400 tons.
It was commissioned Nov. 23, 1968.

<HEAD>Swiss Drug Deaths Reach Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deaths from drug abuse rose to a record
high of 205 last year, authorities said today.
   Rudolf Wyss, chief of the Federal Narcotics Police, said the
death rate per capita in Switzerland was far higher than in
neighboring European states. He said there was no explanation for
this.
   In West Germany, which has 10 times the population of
Switzerland, there were 674 drug-related deaths last year, he said.
   Over the past 10 years more than 1,500 people in Switzerland
have died from drug abuse. After a drop in the number of fatalities
in the middle of the decade, the death rate has risen sharply since
1986.
   Although most deaths are due to heroin addiction, Wyss said the
most significant feature in 1988 was a glut of cocaine. South
American suppliers have turned to Europe because of plummeting
prices on the drug-saturated U.S. market, he said.
   Wyss said there was little sign of crack cocaine, the highly
addictive drug used widely in the United States. He said only two
grams were seized in Switzerland last year.

<TEXT>
   First-year students at the Northeastern
Ohio Universities College of Medicine sang hymns at a memorial
service for 30 cadavers donated to the school.
   ``It brought me back and made me realize that this was someone's
loved one,'' said student Jenniver Uvena, 20, of Boardman.
   Monday's service helped the students accept the idea of death,
said Lisa Windish, an assistant in the anatomy department. ``People
are so afraid of death,'' she said. ``But it's not something to be
afraid of.''
   The day a student enters the dissecting room is the day he or
she becomes a physician, anatomy department chairman Dr. Norman
Taslitz told the 130 students and relatives of those remembered at
the ceremony.
   ``Working with the body and the brain ... is the first
experience of the medical student,'' he said.
   The bodies will be cremated and buried at a nearby cemetery,
where there is a headstone honoring all of those whose bodies have
been donated. The school has held memorial services for 12 years.
   ``It was a very nice service,'' said Frank Raab of Richfield. He
came to remember his mother, who like her husband left her body to
the school.
   ``They felt they could help the young doctors,'' said Raab,
whose brother and sister-in-law drove from Pittsburgh for the
service.
   The Raab brothers said they also planned to donate their bodies.
``I think it's just a waste'' simply to bury a body, Paul Raab said.
   The service serves as a kind of closing ceremony for the
students' year, Taslitz said. ``They can say, `Yes, this was good
and warm and caring,''' he said. ``It's the end of a remarkable
experience.''

   A homeless shelter is honoring the moms of
Skid Row by opening a temporary beauty salon where professional
makeup artists, hair stylists and manicurists are giving homeless
women complete makeovers.
   About 200 women came to the Fred Jordan Mission on Monday for
the makeovers, which will be offered through Thursday along with
new clothes and hot lunches at tables with tablecloths.
   ``Sometimes you got to take the makeup off and just look like
one of the fellas to make it down here,'' said Katheryn Burroughs,
a 27-year-old mother getting her hair styled for the first time in
nearly two years. ``But I'm still a woman, and I like to remember
that.''
   Mission staffer Pansy Newbill said the makeovers, done just
before Mothers Day, were an effort to brighten the lives of the
women on Skid Row.
   ``We've seen so much need among the women that we decided to do
something special for them,'' she said.
   But looking good on Skid Row can be dangerous, some of the women
said.
   ``Most of the guys, when you're pretty, they think you're
working the streets. And if you're not working, they get pretty
rough with you,'' said Sherry Wright, 38, who is pregnant.
   ``I've got a guy living with me now that poses as my boyfriend
just so guys will leave me alone. Daytime's not so bad. Only when
the sun goes down.''

   LaVon Davis says she's still
answering the phone, but apprehensively, since the toll-free number
for her craft shop was advertised as a suicide prevention hotline.
   Davis said Monday she and an employee at her House of France
have received 15 to 20 calls from despondent people in the two
weeks since the number appeared on television. One call came Friday
from someone ``who just wanted to talk.''
   ``It just seemed like these calls would always come in when we
were in the back,'' Davis said. ``We'd run like 60 to get up here
... and it'd be one of these people.''
   Mental health officials have given Davis their numbers to pass
along to callers, she said. She has no plans to change her number.
   ``We've had this number for eight or 10 years,'' she said. ``I'd
have to print all new stationery, and my customers might not
remember the new number. ... I'm just taking a wait-and-see
attitude.''
   The source of the ad remained a mystery. There is no statewide
toll-free suicide hotline. Thomas DeLoach, a Department of Mental
Health spokesman, said he was checking into national organizations
that might have produced the ad.

<TEXT>
   A mother whose infant daughter died after
being born with cocaine in her system has been charged with
involuntary manslaughter and delivery of a controlled substance to
a minor, authorities said.
   Melanie Green, 24, was arrested Monday at her home and freed
from jail on $3,500 bail.
   Her daughter, Bianca, died Feb. 4, two days after birth. An
autopsy showed she died of being deprived of oxygen before birth
because of cocaine use by her mother, authorities said. The drug
was in the child's urine, police said.
   It may be the first manslaughter case of its kind in Illinois,
said Winnebago County State's Attorney Paul Logli. ``I think we're
cutting new ground here,'' he said.
   ``What we're saying is this was an unintentional act, but an
unintentional act without lawful justification,'' Logli said. ``We
believe the medical cause of death of the child is related to the
mom's use of cocaine.''
   ``Whether a judge or jury will fill in the blanks is what this
case is all about.''
   Last week, Winnebago County Juvenile Court Judge Frederick J.
Kapala found a mother who used cocaine during her pregnancy guilty
of child abuse and neglect. The child was temporarily removed from
the mother's custody.
   That child, now 3 months old, has so far shown no serious health
problems associated with cocaine.
   Use of cocaine during pregnancy, Logli said, is ``a brand new
social problem that is growing by alarming proportions. We have to
aspire to protect those people who cannot protect themselves.''
   In December, a Florida woman was charged with child abuse and
delivery of drug after her child was born addicted to cocaine. The
child survived. Prosecutors said it was the first felony drug case
of its kind in that state.
   In 1987, a judge in California dismissed a charge of failure to
provide medical care to a child, lodged against a woman whose son
was born brain damaged and later died.
   Prosecutors had accused her of ignoring a doctor's advice not to
abuse drugs and said the child had amphetamines in his system that
contributed to his death.

   A landlord ejected from a City Council
meeting fired a shotgun blast through a City Hall window, barely
missing the mayor and other officials, police said.
   ``I didn't realize that being the mayor of Saginaw would involve
this much danger,'' Mayor Delbert Schrems said after Monday
evening's shooting.
   The slug passed about a foot over his head before lodging in the
ceiling. The gunman was arrested in a bar about 45 minutes later,
said Lt. Robert Rosenberg. He said formal charges would probably be
filed today.
   Mike Thompson, a Saginaw News reporter at the meeting, said the
landlord had been ordered to close an unlicensed apartment. The man
spoke to the council for about five minutes, using profanity.
Schrems finally ordered police to remove him.
   Rosenberg said the man went to his car, pulled out a shotgun and
fired from about 200 feet away through a second-story window.
   Two City Council members, both former law officers, shouted for
others in the room to lie down, then ran to the window and got a
description of the car in which the man fled. The meeting was
immediately adjourned.
   Schrems was elected in 1987, three months after a neighbor was
charged with making bomb threats to Schrems' home. ``This is the
second time my life has been threatened, and I really don't know
how to deal with it right now,'' he said.

   Thunderstorms rumbled over the south-central part of the nation
early today, dropping heavy rain and spawning tornadoes in Oklahoma
and Mississippi that destroyed homes and knocked out power.
   Storms extended from Oklahoma and northeastern Texas across
Arkansas and Louisiana to Mississippi.
   A tornado in eastern Oklahoma near the Arkansas border destroyed
at least a dozen homes, knocked down power lines and blew trees
onto roads Monday evening, authorities said. No serious injuries
were reported.
   A tornado touched down near the front gate of the Mississippi
State Penitentiary at Parchman, injuring a guard and destroying
three mobile homes, prison officials said. A prison spokesman said
the guard was in stable conditon. The National Weather Service said
it hadn't confirmed if it was a tornado or high wind.
   A twister was sighted six miles from the prison, but no damage
was reported. Marble-size hail, 60 mph wind and uprooted trees were
reported elsewhere in the state.
   As much as 5 inches of rain fell overnight around Clarksdale,
Miss., causing minor flooding that blocked some streets and
highways and extensive damage to newly planted cotton fields.
   Stuttgart, Ark., got 5 inches of rain this morning, including 3
inches in just two hours, the weather service said. Severe
thunderstorms late Monday dropped dime-size hail in Iowa and golf
ball-size hail at Goodland, Kan.
   Rain extended eastward into much of the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys and over much of Alabama and Georgia.
   Elsewhere, showers dampened Wyoming and Colorado. Showers and a
few thunderstorms extended over California and Oregon.
   In Arizona, Phoenix hit 110 degrees Monday, breaking a
104-degree record set in 1934 and marking the earliest date in the
year that temperature has been reached.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
eastern Texas across the Gulf Coast, the Tennessee and Ohio
valleys, the Appalachians and much of the East Coast; possible
severe thunderstorms over central Mississippi, northern and central
Alabama and northern Georgia; and widely scattered thunderstorms
across parts of the West Coast, eastern Colorado and western Kansas.
   Highs were expected to be in the 50s and 60s in the middle and
northern Atlantic Coast, the Appalachians, the Ohio Valley, the
Great Lakes, the middle and upper Mississippi Valley and the
Pacific Coast; in the 90s from southern Texas across southern New
Mexico; near 100 in the Desert Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 30 degrees at Traverse
City, Mich., and Duluth, Minn., to 89 degrees at Phoenix and
Glendale, Ariz.

   A handyman has been convicted of murder
in the death of an elderly amputee who suffered a fatal heart
attack while being raped.
   Jeffrey Washington, 32, could receive life in prison without
parole because the jury ruled Monday the case involved aggravated
battery. No sentencing date was set.
   Relatives discovered Alice Carcieri, 73, dead in her bed the day
after the attack on Christmas night 1987.
   Washington, who sometimes did chores for Carcieri, told police
that the woman had told him she was depressed and hated the
holidays because she didn't have anybody, and he interpreted that

   Neighbors and relatives testified Carcieri, whose legs were
amputated several years ago, was a very religious woman who never
dated and never married. They said Carcieri did not seem depressed
as the holidays approached.

<HEAD>Communist Party Chief To Resign On May 17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberal reformer Stipe Suvar will
step down as Communist Party chief next week to take a seat in the
collective presidency, and retain an influential role in national
affairs.
   News reports said today Suvar will resign as head of the party
on May 17.
   Because the party leadership rotates annually, Suvar would have
had to give up that post next month in any case. Beginning in June,
the leadership transfers to a party official from the republic of
Macedonia.
   Suvar recently was elected to represent the republic of Croatia
in the nine-man presidency, and a party regulation adopted last
year forbids officials from holding state and party jobs
simultaneously.
   Suvar is to be formally inaugurated as a member of the federal
presidency on May 15. This assures Suvar a continued role on the
national political stage, where he is battling his Serbian
political rival, Slobodan Milosevic.
   Milosevic is a more authoritarian, orthodox Communist than
Suvar, although both men have backed market-oriented reforms to try
and ease Yugoslavia's economic crisis.
   Milosevic on Monday was proclaimed president of the republic of
Serbia, which allows him to play a figurehead role in Yugoslavia's
largest republic, where he is already a hero for strengthening
Serbian influence in the nation.
   But Milosevic's new post does not give him a seat in the federal
presidency, and he will have to give up his position as a member of
the party's national Politburo now that he has become head of state
in Serbia.
   Suvar and Milosevic have battled over political issues, but
their disputes also reflect ethnic divides between the Serbs, the
dominant ethnic group in Yugoslavia's patchwork of nationalities,
and the rival Croats and other northern people.
   Yugoslavia's late leader, Josip Broz Tito, bequeathed the
current political maze with the 1974 Constitution that attempted to
prevent any one of the country's republics or nationalities from
dominating national affairs.
   But Milosevic has strengthened Serbian authority in the province
of Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian majority rioted against
Milosevic's policies in March clashes that left at least 24 dead.
   Media reports today quoted Suvar as saying that ``because of the
political quarrels within the party, tomorrow we could have brutal
clashes'' because of the mounting economic and political strife.
Yugoslavia suffers an annual inflation rate of about 500 percent,
which has helped to fuel ethnic tensions.
   Suvar also complained that during his term as the party leader,
the Serbian daily newspaper Politika, believed to be controlled by
Milosevic's supporters, has bitterly criticized him in 700 articles.

<HEAD>Folk Singer Still Sings the Same Tune</HEAD>

   Tall and thin, Pete Seeger stood in front of
the microphone in his blue jeans and flowered shirt, hat pushed
back on his head, and picked out the cords on his banjo.
   He's still singing the same tunes, and has changed little since
the glory days of folk music two decades ago.
   Thousands of those jammed into and around the big tent at the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival knew the words. They stood
and sang without prompting:
   ``Deep in my heart. I do believe. We shall overcome, someday.''
   Abbie Hoffman is dead, Jerry Rubin is part of the establishment,
Jane Fonda is selling exercise tapes, and other activists of the
1960s have either copped out, burned out or dropped out. But the
70-year-old folk singer from Beacon, N.Y., is still at it.
   Seeger's songs are the songs he sang for civil rights, to ban
the bomb, to cry out against the war in Vietnam and poverty and to
fight for human rights throughout the world: ``We Shall Overcome,''
``This Land Is Your Land.''
   The audience was made up of those who marched to his tunes
during the turbulent '60s and who think of that era as history.
   ``My records have never sold very well. A thousand copies here,
1,000 copies there. But, probably every elementary school system in
the country has at least one teacher who has at least one of them
and so kids grow up knowing my work,'' Seeger said of his continued
popularity.
   He continues to perform once or twice a week.
   ``I usually sing to small groups _ 100, 200 people. I still have
things to tell them. Nobody in this world knows all the answers.
All we can do is encourage people to hope. I try to do that,'' he
said.
   His values, once the trendy slogans of a generation, have held
up for him. He lists his heroes as those who suffered on the front
lines to bring civil rights to the South and peace to Southeast
Asia.
   Seeger said he's thoroughly respectable now, disgracefully so.
That wasn't always true. At the height of the McCarthy era he was
held in contempt of Congress and banned from television. In 1949,
while marching with the actor, author and singer Paul Robeson,
Seeger was attacked by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Would he rather be remembered for his music or his politics?
Seeger said it doesn't matter. What matters, he said, is what he
can do now:
   ``I've always said that my epitaph will be `He done his
damnedest.'''
   Seeger's second book, ``Everybody Say Freedom,'' written with
Robert Reser, is due out this year. He and Arlo Guthrie may do a
concert together later this year. He is devoted to the Clearwater
project, an effort he organized years ago to help clean up the
polluted Hudson River in New York and New Jersey. He also is
working for world disarmament.
   ``It's one of the most important issues there is,'' he said
   The '60s may not get a curtain call, but Seeger's not the only
one carrying on that tradition.
   ``There are still people who care,'' he said, ``still people who
think they can make things better. As long as that is true in this
country, we're OK. There's an old saying, `Hope is the opiate of
the masses.' I guess I'm still singing about hope. Who knows, if
people listen long enough, it may make them think about more than
the music. Who knows?''

<HEAD>Iranian President Calls for Closer Ties with China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran, the first
fundamentalist leader of his country to visit communist China,
called today for closer trade and cultural ties with Beijing.
   ``Our great revolution has led to the emergence of new points of
agreement between us and you,'' Khamenei said at a banquet given in
his honor by Chinese President Yang Shangkun. Khamenei also met
with Premier Li Peng, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
   China sold Tehran about $1 billion worth of arms during Iran's
war with Iraq, including missiles and jet fighters, according to
Western officials. Iran and China, which also has good ties to
Iraq, both deny the arms traffic.
   Now that the war has ended, Iran is looking for Chinese help to
rebuild its economy. Since a cease-fire began in August, China and
Iran have signed agreements to build a dam and two major power
plants in Iran and to share communication technology.
   In his banquet speech, Khamenei recalled the early development
of sea and overland trade between China and Iran, then called
Persia.
   ``We believe there is a need to further develop and deepen our
economic, trade, technical and cultural relations,'' he said.
   Xinhua quoted Li as expressing similar hopes.
   Khamenei was to meet Wednesday with Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang. He will visit North Korea after six days in
China.

<HEAD>Dole Calls for Renewed Military Aid for Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole today called
for resumption of ``significant military aid'' to Contra rebels if
the leftist government in Nicaragua fails to hold a free election
and abide by its results.
   Testifying before the privately financed Commission on Free and
Fair Elections in Nicaragua, the Kansas senator said he is not
optimistic about the outlook for next year's balloting.
   The panel of three Democrats and three Republicans was
established by the World Freedom Foundation, a self-styled research
and educational organization based in Alexandria, Va.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega signed an agreement with El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica in February in which
he promised electoral and other legal reforms to ensure fair
general elections, which are to be held in February. Last week,
however, the Sandinista government rejected an opposition demand to
negotiate further reforms.
   ``In my view,'' Dole said, ``by far the best way to keep
pressure on the Sandinistas would have been to continue effective
aid to the freedom fighters,'' the term given to the Contras by
their supporters in the United States. ``But realistically, that is
not an option for the immediate future.''
   Congress ended military aid to the Contra rebels at the end of
February 1988.
   ``And I am not optimistic that there are enough remaining points
of leverage to put real heat on Managua to live up to its own
commitments, and its responsibility to the citizens of Nicaragua. I
hope I am wrong.''
   ``I hope so. But, candidly, I am not very optimistic,'' Dole
said. ``The record so far _ as manifest, for example, in the sham
of a new elelction law recnetly promulgated by the comandantes _ is
hardly encouraging.''
   ``What if next February comes and goes, and there is no free
elelction, perhaps not even any election?'' Dole asked. ``What if
the Sandinistas `win' the election through fraud, or lose the
elelction but refuse to yield power ...?
   In that event, he said, ``I hope that we will articulate and
implement a policy that will apply direct and effective pressure on
the Sandinistas, including through the resumption of significant
military aid to a revitalized Democratic resistance.''
   The Bush administration has abandoned plans to seek immediate
military aid, which was the consistent policy of the Reagan
administration, and recently reached a bipartisan agreement with
Congress providing for non-military assistance.
   The World Freedom Foundation is headed by L. Brent Bozell III, a
prominent conservative. The co-chairmen of the commission are
Curtin Winsor Jr., former U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica in the
Reagan administration; Gaylord Nelson, former Democratic senator
from Wisconsin; Sergio Bendixen, a Democratic political consultant;
Alan Keyes, former assistant secretary of state for international
organization affairs in the Reagan administration; Elaine Kamarck,
a Democratic political consultant; and Victor Gold, who served as
an advisor to President Bush in 1980 and 1984.

   The government vowed today to prosecute
law-breaking African National Congress guerrillas but said it will
not disarm them.
   Alex Shapi, defense and security secretary, said his government
expects guerrillas taking refuge in Zambia to abide by the laws of
this southern African nation.
   Shapi's statement came after a guerrilla of the South African
nationalist movement on Sunday shot and killed his Zambian
girlfriend, then turned his AK47 assault rifle on himself.
   ``Where they contravene the law, we will take action,'' Shapi
said.
   He said authorities will not seize guerrillas' weapons because
``not all of them lack discipline.''
   The ANC, the main guerrilla organization fighting the South
African government, has its external headquarters in Lusaka.
   In the past four years, the guerrillas have lost many southern
African bases as Pretoria has negotiated rapprochement with nearby
black governments, or bombed countries like Botswana and Zimbabwe,
where it charges the ANC have bases used to plan attacks on South
Africa. Botswana and Zimbabwe say they give sanctuary only to
unarmed ANC officials and South African exiles.
   ANC bases in Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, and most recently
this year in Angola, have been shut down as the black-ruled nations
signed non-aggression pacts with Pretoria. About 6,000 ANC fighters
were transferred from Angola to Tanzania in East Africa.

<TEXT>
   The civilian government of President
Vinicio Cerezo said it thwarted a coup attempt today by air force
officers and soldiers.
   Government spokesman Carlos Anleu said troops loyal to Cerezo
arrested an undetermined number of air force personnel who
participated in the coup attempt, which lasted about two hours.
   ``Everything is under control,'' Anleu said. He said the coup
was put down with no shots fired.
   The attempt was staged by a tactical unit of the air force based
south of Guatemala City in a military section of the international
airport, Anleu said, and was led by retired military officers. He
did not identify them.
   The coup attempt was stopped when soldiers loyal to the
government entered the city in tanks and helicopters, the spokesman
said.
   About 6:30 a.m. troops and soldiers, many wearing the blue
handerkerchiefs that are a sign of loyalists, surrounded the home
of the defense minister, Gen. Alejandro Gramajo. Military planes
and helicopters flew overhead and tanks were parked strategically
nearby.
   In May 1988, a military coup attempt failed when Gramajo refused
to join it and backed the civilian government.
   By 8:30 a.m., most of the troops had returned to their barracks
and the aircraft returned to their bases. Morning rush-hour
activity had returned to normal in the capital. Radio stations
played military music during the attempt, then returned to normal
programming.
   In Washington, a State Department official said reports from the
U.S. Embassy and from Guatemalans also indicated the coup attempt
was unsuccessful. The official said the coup attempt may have been
aimed not at Cerezo, whose whereabouts were unknown, but at Granajo
or other cabinet ministers.
   Cerezo took office in January 1986, heading the first elected
civilian administration in 16 years. He had been under attack from
the right wing for opening talks with the leftist insurgency, the
Revolutionary Union, which has been conducting a guerrilla war for
30 years.
   During the attempted coup by army officers on May 11, 1988, two
columns of troops marched on the capital to seize power. But their
attempt was quashed without a shot being fired. Six officers were
arrested.
   On April 16, Cerezo blamed rightist paramilitary groups for a
growing wave of violence and said they threatened the nation's
democracy. ``Democracy is being put in danger by the recklessness
of some groups and people who constantly violate the law,'' he said
in a nationally broadcast address.
   The president blamed the right-wing groups for the death of Irma
Esquivel de Lara, 37, a criminal court judge who was gunned down on
a street in the capital earlier in April.
   ``There exist some groups traditionally of the extreme right
that aren't happy with democracy. They don't like it that we are
satisfied with a democratic government,'' Cerezo said at the time.
   Cerezo, 46, a Christian Democrat, is due to leave office in 1991.
   The Central American nation of 8.5 million people, about the
size of Tennessee, is bounded on the north and west by Mexico, the
south by the Pacific Ocean and the east by El Salvador, Honduras
and Belize.
   Guatemala never has sustained a modern democratic govenment. It
is widely agreed that civilian authority exists because of military
consent and supervision.
   Guatemala was widely shunned by the international community
while the country was under the military rulers of the early 1980s.
The armed forces and death squads linked to the military were
blamed for killing tens of thousands of people. The army denied the
charges.
   Thousands of Indians were killed or driven into the hills. More
than half the population is made up of Indians who speak two dozen
Mayan dialects.
   Former President Carter cut off U.S. aid to the country, but
non-military aid was restored under the Reagan administration.

   Journalists for China's official media gave the
government a petition Tuesday with more than 1,000 signatures
calling for a dialogue on censorship, while hundreds of students
chanted their support.
   ``Restrictions of every kind have prevented full, objective and
fair reporting'' on recent student protests for democratic reform,
said the petition. It was a rare expression of discontent by
China's reporters, many of whom are members of the ruling Communist
Party.
   The petition said there was a need for party propaganda
officials to meet with reporters on censorship and the recent
firing of the editor of China's most liberal paper after he
rejected censors' demands.
   Li Datong, an editor at the China Youth News and organizer of
the petition, later said he heard reports that Hu Qili, a top party
official responsible for media affairs, already had agreed to a
dialogue.
   ``We don't hope for this dialogue to have direct results,'' he
said. ``Such things are achieved by a process. But we think this
dialogue will be a good beginning.''
   Hundreds of journalists jammed the offices of the All-China
Journalists Association, a government-sponsored organization, to
hand in the petition with 1,013 signatures. Signers included
reporters from the Xinhua News Agency, the People's Daily and China
Central Television.
   Outside, about 500 students from Beijing University and other
schools waved banners on press freedom and chanted, ``The media
should tell the truth.''
   Yang Yi, an official at the Journalists Association who accepted
the petitition, said he would give it to party officials and would
try to help organize a dialogue. He also promised the associaton
would ``make efforts for media reform.''
   Li said he thought it was possible Shanghai authorities would
reinstate Qin Benli, the editor of the weekly World Economic
Herald, but only if more appeals are made on his behalf. Under Qin,
the Herald printed more lively, controversial articles than any
other Chinese publication, and his dismissal has caused outcries
from journalists, students and other academics.
   ``We are very embarrassed by our position during such a
large-scale student movement that aroused concern domestically and
overseas,'' said Guo Jiakuan, a reporter for China Youth News.
   The official media initially maintained silence on the student
protests that began April 15 and were the largest in 40 years of
communist rule. Xinhua later issued brief reports on the protests
and only a few newspapers made clear the huge scale of the marches
and the broad support from ordinary citizens.
   Many reporters attended the marches and handed in stories and
photographs but said their editors decided not to use most of it
for fear it would fuel the protests.
   Even Xinhua's report of the journalists' petition bore the
censor's mark. In quoting from the petition, Xinhua removed
references to ``restrictions'' and deleted the journalists' denial
that China has a free press. It added of the reporters' complaints,
``This is just a problem to be solved during the reform of the news
reporting system.''
   ``The students rely on the foreign press to promote China's
democracy,'' complained a woman from the Academy of Social
Science's News Research Department. ``This is a disgrace for the
Chinese press.''
   One of the key demands of the students is a free press.
   The students who gathered outside the Journalists Association
said they wanted to support the reporters' petition. The students
also are demanding their own dialogue with government leaders on a
broad range of political reforms, including guarantee of human
rights.
   ``We are extremely thankful for your support in our struggle,''
Li told the students.
   The students, who arrived on bicycle with red flags and banners
flying, regrouped in nearby Tiananmen Square, where tens of
thousands of students have rallied in the past three weeks. Then
they bicycled across town to hold an hour-long sit-in outside the
offices of the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Communist Party.
   ``Editor-in-chief, come out!'' they chanted. They also quoted
from writings of senior leader Deng Xiaoping saying society should
be changed democratically, not by violence.
   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi said in a speech directed at those in
the People's Daily office: ``Television, newspapers and radio must
speak the truth. The people no longer believe you. Reform
yourselves.''
   Student activists said they planned similar protests at the
offices of China Central Television and Xinhua.

<HEAD>48 Nuclear Weapons, 11 Reactors Litter Ocean Floor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hydrogen bomb that sank in secrecy off
Okinawa in 1965 was just one of 48 nuclear weapons and 11 reactors
lost at sea by the Soviet Union and the United States since World
War II, says the environmental group Greenpeace.
   The most recent loss was a Soviet Mike-class submarine off the
coast of Norway April 7, with two nuclear reactors aboard, said
Joshua Handler, one of the Greenpeace activists who prepared the
report.
   The most serious loss was a Soviet Yankee-class submarine that
sank in the Atlantic Ocean Oct. 6, 1986, off the coast of Bermuda.
Yankee-class subs are believed to carry 16 SS-N-6 ballistic
missiles, with two warheads apiece, and to be powered by two
nuclear reactors, according to Western defense analysts.
   Greenpeace said that most of the nuclear weapons and reactors
littering the ocean floor were lost at sea by the Soviet Union,
which despite its new-found openness remains far more secretive
about its nuclear armaments than does the United States.
   Handler, interviewed by telephone Monday, declined to provide a
complete list of the 48 nuclear weapons and 11 reactors he believes
are on the ocean floor. He said a full list of the nuclear devices
Greenpeace believes are on the ocean floor will be released next
month.
   Known incidents include:
   _The Soviet Mike-class submarine, April 7, 1989, with two
reactors.
   _The Soviet Yankee-class submarine in 1986, with 32 warheads and
two reactors.
   _A Soviet November-class submarine in 1970, with two reactors.
   _The U.S. submarine Scorpion, in 1968, with one reactor.
   _The U.S. B-43 bomb from the Ticonderoga in 1965.
   _The U.S. submarine Thresher, in 1963, with one reactor.
   Sixteen years after the Okinawa accident, the U.S. Navy
acknowledged it had lost a B-43 bomb aboard an A-4 attack plane off
the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga on Dec. 5, 1965, as the ship
steamed toward port in Japan after bombing missions off Vietnam.
   In its 1981 statement, the Navy said the incident had taken took
place ``more than 500 miles from land ... at sea in the Pacific.''
   But Handler and William Arkin, defense analyst for the Institute
for Policy Studies, a liberal, Washington-based research center,
said they had discovered from the Ticonderoga's logs that the
accident occurred in international waters about 80 miles from the
closest point of the Okinawa island chain and only 200 miles or so
east of the heavily populated island of Okinawa.
   At the time of the accident, Okinawa was under U.S. control. It
was returned to Japan in 1972.
   The Navy said in 1981 that the jet ``rolled off the elevator of
a U.S. aircraft carrier and fell into the sea'' and that the pilot,
plane and bomb were all lost.
   Arkin said Monday there was little danger of detonation from the
one-megaton bomb, which has a force of 1 million tons of TNT. But
the 15 kilograms of plutonium in the bomb, he added, could threaten
the environment as it deteriorates.
   The A-4 was the Navy's main deep-strike aircraft at the time,
and an undisclosed number on each U.S. carrier would always be
equipped with B-43 hydrogen bombs, Arkin said.
   The Navy on Monday maintained its policy of not commenting on
whether its ships carry nuclear weapons.

   A Christian hospital and a Moslem
hospital were shelled in fierce fighting across this divided city,
and four people were killed, including two patients, police said
today.
   Police said 20 people also were wounded in the shelling
barrages, which subsided into sporadic exchanges at daybreak today
and intensified again later.
   Since March 8, when the current round of fighing broke out
between Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army units and an alliance of
Syrian and Druse forces, 320 people have been killed and 1,204
wounded.
   The artillery battles also threaten efforts by the Arab League
to revive a truce called on April 29 that held briefly before
fighting resumed.
   A police spokesman said at least 12 howitzer and mortar rounds
hit the Barbir Hospital in Moslem west Beirut and its surroundings
late Monday.
   He said one shell slammed into the hospital's lobby as patients
were being moved to an underground shelter. The attack killed
Mohammed Mosallam, an administrator, and Bilal Daher, a reporter.
   Daher, 25, a Sunni Moslem, was ``trying to evacuate his elder
brother Ouday, also a reporter, from his third-floor room to the
underground shelter,'' said the spokesman. The elder Daher had been
hospitalized with a broken leg.
   Crews swept out glass shards and debris at the hospital as
several nurses and doctors wiped away tears, reporters said.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
rules, said St. Louis Hospital in the Christian port of Jounieh
north of Beirut also took several direct howitzer hits but that no
casualties were reported. The spokesman said the patients were
``already in the underground shelter when the hospital was hit.''
   Elsewhere in the city, post offices and communications
facilities also were hit, knocking out local and overseas telephone
links, he said.
   To help fill the gap, the leftist Voice of the People radio
broadcast messages from people in Beirut to relatives in other
parts of Lebanon.
   Only a few civilians ventured out of basements and underground
shelters to check their property for shelling damage.
   About 31,000 shells and rockets have been fired on Beirut's
Moslem and Christian sectors since the non-stop artillery duel
began Saturday evening, the police spokesman said.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation and other radio stations said
Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria, trying to reach
Lebanon to salvage the cease-fire, was stranded in Rome by an
airport strike.
   The rival factions in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war accepted
the league-sponsored truce last week. But a reliable source in west
Beirut said the Syrians resumed shelling to prevent three Iraqi
ships loaded with weapons from resupplying the Christians.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the ships
``have been cruising the Mediterranean off the Christian enclave's
coast since Friday.''
   Iraq supports Aoun's 20,000 troops, most of whom are Christians,
in the confrontation with Syrian forces and the Moslem Druse
militia of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party.

   The National AIDS Program Office is offering a
new service to help people infected with the deadly virus find out
how to participate in government-sponsored experiments testing
AIDS-fighting drugs, officials said Tuesday.
   The information is available by dialing a toll-free number,
which will be answered by health specialists who have access to a
database offering details on about 80 clinical trials sponsored by
the National Institutes of Health.
   NIH is sponsoring about one-third of the current clinical trials
of experimental AIDS and AIDS-related therapies, said Dr. Anthony
S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.
   NIH-sponsored trials are being conducted in more than 100
medical centers and hospicals across the country.
   The new database service will provide information on the trials
faster and more easily to physicians, AIDS patients and their
families, Fauci said. Previously, the information had to be
gathered from several sources.
   Fauci said he hoped that increased access to clinical trials
would help NIH enroll more blacks, Hispanics, intravenous drug
users and hemophiliacs.
   AIDS ``is taking a heavy toll among these groups, and they have
been underrepresented in AIDS clinical trials,'' Fauci said.
   He also said he hopes the project will enroll more women in
trials designed to develop ways to prevent the transmission of the
HIV infection from mothers to their infants.
   The AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service is reached by
dialing 1-800-TRIALS-A, Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7
p.m., Eastern time.

<TEXT>
   The Panamanian government, its vote
count denounced as fraudulent by international observers, today
announced partial election returns that showed its candidate ahead.
   Returns from four of 40 election districts showed Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate, Carlos Duque,
leading opposition candidate Guillermo Endara by 80,646 votes to
54,437.
   The announcement came after former President Jimmy Carter said
Noriega's men were stealing the vote with counterfeit tallies. It
also followed a street demonstration by more than 15,000 protesters
Monday that was broken up by gunfire. Three people were wounded,
one seriously.
   ``I hope there will be a worldwide outcry against this dictator
stealing the election from his own people,'' said Carter, an
invited observer.
   The government electoral tribunal had been without votes to
count until late Monday following raids at polling precincts by
Noriega's troops, who scooped up ballot counts throughout the
nation.
   The government had originally said it would announce complete
results within 24 hours of Sunday's poll closing.
   The vote center was closed this morning, and there was no
indication when more results would be released.
   Carter said Monday voting records stolen on Sunday night and
early Monday had been substituted with bogus replacements not
signed by opposition party members as is required.
   Carter had to use a hotel lobby for his news conference because
he was denied the use of the government-run press center. He said
Panamanian cooperation with his mission vanished as soon as he
raised the fraud issue.
   The government today also removed all equipment for feeding
television signals via satellite from its press center, forcing
networks to fly tape to Costa Rica.
   Carter, who observed voting in several precincts Sunday, said he
would have had no problems with what he saw if the vote count was
honest.
   He met Monday with Endara and congratulated him on his victory.
   Carter departed early this morning from Howard Air Force Base,
said Lt. Col. James Swank, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command.
   Sunday's vote was considered a referendum on Noriega, Panama's
de facto leader and chief of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces. The
United States has been trying to oust him for more than a year.
   In Washington, President Bush and top advisers met Monday and
discussed further steps. An administration official said options
included more economic sanctions and sending additional troops to
reinforce the 10,000 U.S. service personnel based in the former
Canal Zone.
   Both Endara and Noriega's Duque, had claimed victories by wide
margins before any official results were released.
   Exit polls by the opposition and the Roman Catholic Church gave
Endara about 70 percent of the vote. A similar poll by
pro-government parties gave their candidate the victory.
   Panamanian law requires election results to be made public
within 24 hours after polls close. In 1984, in results widely
believed to be fraudulent, the government waited three days before
declaring itself the winner.
   ``This election was a terrible fraud on the Panamanian people,''
said Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., a member of an uninvited observer
delegation sent by Bush. ``Polls opened late, peoples' names were
not on lists, dead peoples' names were on lists after years of not
appearing on lists.''
   Duque denounced what he said was ``obvious American intervention
in affairs that concern only Panama and said the claims of stolen
tallies were the stuff of a soap opera plot.''
   U.S.-Panama relations have been poor since February 1988, when
Noriega orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle,
and the CIA reportedly contributed $10 million to the opposition
campaign.
   Delvalle had tried to fire the general after he was indicted in
Florida on drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges. Noriega
claims the U.S. charges are a smokescreen to avoid ceding control
of the Panama Canal in 1999 under a 1977 treaty.
   On Monday, troops fired 50 to 100 rounds of shotgun, pistol and
carbine fire, mostly into the air, to break up the protest march.
   The shooting started as a car bearing large Duque posters drove
into the crowd. Demonstators threw stones at it but scattered when
men in civilian clothes inside the car opened fire.
   Troops in riot gear began firing into the air and the men leaped
from the car firing AK-47 assault rifles, carbines and shotguns
into the air.
   They identified themselves only as being ``of the people.''
   Those hit by gunfire were a Panamanian television cameraman,
seriously wounded in the chest, a reporter for the Paris newspaper
Le Monde and a marcher.
   The circumstances surrounding the shootings were not immediately
clear.
   In Miami on Monday, Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla., and Bob Graham,
D-Fla., said the United States should consider armed intervention
and abrogation of the Panama Canal treaty if Noriega holds on to
power.
   The two were among the election observers sent by Bush.

   Five fortune tellers from northern
England said Tuesday they had to abandon a tour of Ireland because
their crystal balls were stolen.
   Margaret Pickering said members of the group sensed something
might go wrong soon after they arrived in Ireland.
   ``We were aware something was about to happen, but we did not

think our luggage might be taken.''
   The crystal balls, tarot cards and other essential tools of the
clairvoyants' trade were taken from their car while it was parked
outside a guest house in Dublin.
   Irish police said they were investigating the theft.
   ``Just what the thieves will do with their haul remains a
mystery,'' a spokesman said. ``You might say we are looking into it
... if only we had a crystal ball to help us.''

<HEAD>Beijing University Students Try to Keep Flame of Democracy Alight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Beijing University students, proud of their
school's rich history of leading revolutionary and nationalist
campaigns, desperately are trying to keep alive the democracy
movement that has lost steam on other campuses.
   ``It has a long history of fighting for democracy,'' one
undergraduate said during a Monday night campus march to drum up
support for a 2-week-old class boycott. ``Beijing University is
always at the vanguard of the student movements.''
   Its students are remembered for leading the landmark May 4,
1919, uprising in which intellectuals demanded democracy and
science to modernize China.
   Now, 70 years later, Beijing University students have emerged as
the keeper of the flame of a nearly month-old movement for more
freedom in this authoritarian society.
   ``All of China watches Beijing. All of Beijing watches Beijing
University,'' one poster said after most other campuses ended the
class boycott this past weekend.
   Activists no longer talk of staging more mass marches that
brought tens of thousands of people into the capital's streets, but
say they will print newspapers and pamphlets to press their views.
   However, many of the more than 10,000 students at Beijing
University, the nation's most prestigious school, are hanging
tough. They argue that further pressure on the government is needed
to open a dialogue with communist officials to demand press freedom
and a halt to corruption.
   Within hours of the announcement that student activists planned
to end the citywide class strike, angry posters emerged at Beijing
University urging students to ``boycott to the end.'' Students
quickly voted to continue the strike until at least Friday, and
perhaps two-thirds of them stayed away from class Monday.
   About 1,300 Beijing University students staged a noisy march
around campus late Monday, chanting ``One, two, boycott class,''
and urging teachers to join. Some said they hope their continued
defiance will convince other major universities to resume the
boycott.
   ``This school is the seed of the democracy movement,'' said one
marcher, explaining why many Beijing University students have
refused to follow others back to class.
   ``I want to go to class, we all do,'' said another, ``but we
can't because we haven't got any real results.''
   On Tuesday, students at two other universities were planning to
rejoin Beijing University and resume the boycott, and a new wave of
the big character posters that provide a primary means of political
expression appeared.
   Some Beijing University students said they are considering a
bicycle procession through Beijing.
   Beijing University students remain feisty for several reasons.
Students say they have not experienced the strong pressure to end
the strike applied by authorities at other schools.
   Pride in the 90-year-old school for its leadership in previous
campaigns by intellectuals to awaken the masses also has spurred
the students to action.
   The school was set up as the Peking Imperial University in 1898,
during the ``100-Day Reform'' movement that attempted to introduce
some Western ideas in government and education to the fast
declining Qing dynasty.
   Among major personalities at the school in its first decades
were Chen Duxiu, a father of Chinese leftism, and Li Dazhao, one of
China's first Marxists. When he was school librarian, one of Li's
assistants was a country boy named Mao Tse-tung.
   Mao went on to establish the People's Republic of China in 1949.
Eight years later, when he encouraged critics to speak out, Beijing
University teachers declared that ``the masses want to overthrow
the Communist Party.'' They were among the first to be purged in a
subsequent crackdown.
   The school occupies 500 acres of wooded land in northwest
Beijing. It includes imperial-style buildings with red pillars and
slanted tiled roofs, as well as blocks of dank and dreary
dormitories where each room houses about six students.

   President Roh Tae-woo called Tuesday
for a tougher crackdown on violent protesters and declared ``the
government has gone through a stage of self-restraint.''
   ``The fate of the country hinges on whether law and order can be
maintained,'' Roh told a special Cabinet meeting to discuss
measures to end violent anti-government demonstrations.
   However, some opposition members who contend police inflame
rioters, called Tuesday in the National Assembly for the government
to limit police use of tear gas.
   Roh, on the other hand, ordered Cabinet ministers to use all
government and security force resources to clamp down on radical
students, dissidents and striking workers who resort to violence.
   He accused them of plotting a leftist revolution to overthrow
what he called South Korea's liberal democratic system.
   Roh's warning came after six riot policemen were burned to death
and 10 others critically injured in a May 3 clash with radical
students in southern Pusan. It was the worst political violence in
South Korea in recent years.
   The incident prompted a nationwide call against political
violence, and the government swiftly arrested several radical
leaders.
   Under mounting public pressure, the main radical National
Council of Student Representatives last week renounced violence.
The group said it would not use firebombs if authorities ease
controls on anti-government demonstrations.
   On Tuesday, 6,600 students peacefully demonstrated at 21
universities and colleges in Seoul and elsewhere. No clashes was
reported, police said.
   At some schools, police said students even destroyed hundreds of
firebombs before starting anti-government rallies or campus marches.
   At a special session of the National Assembly on Tuesday, many
ruling and opposition lawmakers supported proposals to ban
firebombs, a main protest weapon.
   But some opposition members objected. They claimed excessive use
of tear gas has tended to aggravate violent protests.
   The main opposition parties, which have condemned violent
protests, plan a major attack on the government during the session,
based on charges Roh has failed to carry out promised democratic
reforms.
   Top opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung are
demanding the resignation of Roh's entire Cabinet to accept
responsibility for the political unrest.
   Roh told Tuesday's Cabinet meeting he will use police to end
violent strikes and protests.
   ``We cannot allow indefinitely a situation in which some
campuses become hotbeds for training leftist revolutionary forces
and bases for producing firebombs and leftist revolution,'' Roh
said.
   Radical students and anti-government dissident groups have
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme
political views.

<HEAD>Reich Urges Allowing Palestinians to Call for Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top American Jewish leader said Tuesday that
Palestinian participants in proposed elections should not be banned
from the elective process for advocating an independent state for
their people.
   ``I would not think that advocating such a position would be a
bar to being elected or engaging in the elective process,'' Seymour
Reich told reporters at the National Press Club.
   Reich is head of the national B'nai B'rith organization and
chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Groups.
   His comments came in reaction to an interview with Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, published Tuesday by the Jerusalem Post,
in which Shamir said that Palestinians who run in elections that he
has proposed must agree that the occupied lands will not become an
independent Palestinian nation.
   Shamir told the newspaper the agreement would apply to an
interim period of autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to
negotiations on the final status of the territories, seized by
Israel in 1967.
   ``If elections are to be conducted they have to be conducted in
a free atmosphere of speech, without threat of violence or
intimidation. And I would think someone seeking office, running on
a platform, can espouse any position that they want to including
land for peace, including an independent Palestinian state. I don't
see anything objectionable to that,'' Reich said.
   ``I think anyone can run as long as they are not terrorists or
identified as such,'' he added.
   Reich met with reporters to mark the 41st anniversary of the
founding of Israel, an event being celebrated starting at sundown
Tuesday.
   After 41 years of ``fighting in a sea of hostile countries,'' he
said, ``this tiny island of a state continues to exist in a
democratic environment.''
   Reich gave President Bush a rating of 98 in his dealings with
Israel, saying that ``98 out of 100 is not bad.''
   Bush has made many positive steps in working toward peace in the
Middle East, Reich said.
   The reason Bush got 98 instead of 100, Reich said, was because
of a statement opposing the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip which did not also note that the areas were occupied as a
defensive measure, not out of aggression.
   While Shamir has suggested previously that he might ask for such
an agreement by Palestinian candidates avoiding calls for
independence, his interview was his most wide-ranging statement on
his plan.
   Leading Palestinians in the occupied lands and the Palestine
Liberation Organization have said any elections must be part of a
plan leading to Palestinian independence.

<HEAD>Pope Says He Intends to Keep Traveling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has dismissed criticism of his
foreign pilgrimages as ``prejudice'' and says he intends to keep
traveling.
   In an interview published Tuesday, he expressed hope of being
able to visit other countries in Eastern Europe besides his native
Poland, noting the winds of change blowing in the Communist bloc.
   ``I think we are talking often of prejudice,'' John Paul was
quoted as saying in the interview with an Italian newspaper group.
He returned Saturday from Africa, the 41st foreign trip in his
10{-year pontificate.
   At the start of his papacy, John Paul said, some at the Vatican
had advised against a visit to a meeting of Latin American bishops
in Mexico, which his predecessor, John Paul I, had decided not to
attend.
   ``It seemed to me that the pope should be present at that
important appointment of the church in Latin America,'' he said.
The trip in January 1979 was John Paul's first foreign pilgrimage.
   He acknowledged that ``some in the West, in Europe'' have
accused him of ``triumphalism (which) blocks the ecumenical
process'' and suggested it would be better for him to engage in
dialogue than draw crowds.
   But that is what he does, John Paul said, citing his meeting
with American bishops when he visited the United States in 1987 and
the recent meeting with a delegation of U.S. bishops at the
Vatican, which he termed ``very useful.''
   ``It's not dialogue what I will be doing within a few weeks with
the Lutheran brothers in Scandinavia?'' he asked, referring to his
next pilgrimage that begins June 1.
   John Paul said he's convinced the trips are useful.
   He noted that besides his three pilgrimages to Poland he has not
been able to go ``beyond the eastern frontier'' of Europe.
   ``I think, however, that with all that is happening there ... it
will be the circumstances, as always, to decide. I have always felt
myself guided by circumstances, that is, by Providence.''

<HEAD>Energy Official Says Controversial Dam Project Can Be Stopped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hungarian energy official Tuesday was
quoted as saying a controversial dam project opposed by tens of
thousands of environmentalists could be stopped ``in the nation's
interest.''
   The statement was the latest sign Hungary may pull out of the
project, a multimillion-dollar plan with Czechoslovakia and Austria
to make the Danube River more navigable and build power stations in
Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   About 140,000 Hungarians have signed a petition calling for a
referendum on the project, which has been under fire since it was
first agreed to in the late 1970s.
   Opposition in Hungary has become more vocal as democratic groups
have gained more say in politics in recent months. The more
orthodox Czechoslovak Communists, who insist the project should be
completed, expressed irritation with the opposition in their party
daily last weekend.
   The plan to build the Hungarian dam at Nagymaros, about 30 miles
upstream from Budapest on the Danube, is seen by many Hungarians as
a symbol of the centralized economic planning of the past in which
citizens were given no say.
   Czechoslovak officials already have invested $1.1 billion in a
much larger dam and power station being built as part of the
project at Gabcikovo, about 40 miles east of Bratislava.
   Environmentalists have long argued the project affecting more
than 60 miles of the Danube will destroy wetlands with unique
wildlife. They also claim a huge underground reservoir of drinking
water will be spoiled by the power stations and canals to be built
along the river.
   ``Our position is that the Nagymaros construction can be halted
but Gabcikovo must be completed,'' Istvan Papp, director of
Hungary's state Energy Economy Institute, told the daily Mai Nap
newspaper on Tuesday.
   ``This compromise would be a solution best serving the nation's
interests,'' he added.
   Experts on both sides acknowledge the projects are too
interrelated for Gabcikovo to be effective without the Hungarian
dam.
   Hungary's government and parliament are to debate the call for a
referendum on Nagymaros this month. However, even opponents of the
project question the wisdom of putting such a complex issue to a
popular vote.
   Papp said the government would save half a billion dollars by
stopping investment in the project, which on the Hungarian side has
been financed in part by Austria in return for future deliveries of
electricity.
   Papp said his calculations did not include the cost of
compensating Austria and Czechoslovakia if Hungary pulled out of
the project.

<UNK>Baker Meets President Koivisto Before Moscow Visit</UNK>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
on a stopover here for his trip to Moscow, discussed Soviet affairs
and international relations Tuesday with Finnish President Mauno
Koivisto.
   Neutral Finland has traditionally close ties and a friendship
treaty with the Soviet Union. Koivisto was in Moscow last October.
   At a luncheon, ``both Baker and President Koivisto expressed the
wish to see a continuation in perestroika,'' said Arno Karhilo,
Foreign Ministry undersecretary of state.
   Baker also met separately with Prime Minister Harri Holkeri.
   Arriving here Monday night, Baker praised the state of
U.S.-Finnish relations and lauded the Finnish contribution to the
U.N. peacekeeping forces which he said ``give this country an
important role in many global issues of interest to both our
countries.''
   Baker heads to Moscow on Wednesday, seeking President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's help in forging peace in the Middle East and playing
down the issue of arms control.
   Baker is trying to prod Israel into negotiations with the
Palestinians and has concluded he needs the support of both Moscow
and the Palestine Liberation Organization. He is hoping the Soviets
under Gorbachev would bring the pressure it has refused to exert in
the past on Syria to support peace talks that do not hold out the
promise of a Palestinian state.
   On the arms control front, Baker heads to Moscow with a date _
the third week in June _ for the reopening of U.S.-Soviet
negotiations to reduce the superpowers' long-range bombers, nuclear
submarines and globe-girdling missiles.
   But he was not planning to outline the position the United
States would take at the table. Nor was he assuring the Soviets
that there would be no changes since the talks were recessed in
November.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviets ``can expect to see a considerable degree of continuity
with the positions of the prior administration'' but added: ``we
reserve the right to change and modify some of those positions.''
   The two sides had about 90 percent of a weapons-reduction treaty
completed when the talks recessed. But several knotty issues stood
in the way of an agreement.
   These included whether to try to ban mobile intercontinental
ballistic missiles and how to verify arsenals of cruise missiles
aboard ships and warplanes.

   President Bush today weighed options ranging
from military intervention to economic actions toward Panama in
reaction to an election U.S. officials say was riddled with fraud,
his spokesman said.
   White House Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater would not elaborate
on the possible options but hinted that provisions of the 1977
Panama Canal treaties might be used to intensify pressures against
Panama's defacto ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The bottom line U.S. posistion remains that ``Noriega must go,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``We are convinced that the oppossition candidates had the
support and the votes to fairly win this election and we are just
as convinced that the Noriega regime made every effort, took every
opportunity and had every intention of stealing this election
regardless of the actual vote,'' Fitzwater said of Sunday's
ballotting.
   In a formal statement read to White House reporters, the
spokesman said the United States has been considering options
``that range from the use of military force to varoius economic and
commerical moves related to United States pressure in that
country.''
   He said U.S. officials are in contact with democratic allies in
the region, seeking to enlist their support for the anti-Noriega
move.
   ``There is no plan to abrogate the canal treaties,'' under which
the United States has agreed to turn the American-built canal over
to Panamanian control on the last day of this century, Fitzwater
said. ``However we do have concerns about how they are carried
out.''
   He mentioned provisions dealing with protection of U.S. citizens
in the isthmus and the sea-to-sea strategic canal itself, saying
``Those could be very useful,'' to the United States in its
dealings with Noriega.
   Fitzwater said U.S. troops in Panama are on ``a very high state
of alert.''
   Fitzwater made the comments after Bush was briefed by members of
an official observer team that he sent to monitor the election
Sunday.
   ``He didn't leave anything out of the discussion. Every
conceivable range of options was discussed,'' said Rep. John
Murtha, D-Pa., who headed the delegation. Former President Jimmy
Carter, who led another observer group, was to meet with the
president tonight to give his report on the Sunday elections.
   The observers reported widespread fraud to favor Carlos Duque,
the presidential candidate of Panama's de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   ``There's a lot more support for that (military) option today
than there was say six months or a year ago,'' said Sen. Connie
Mack, R-Fla., another member of the observer team.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said ``the scenario of sending tanks
in the streets of Panama City is not one tht I could foresee under
any circumstances but the option of the military ... is one that
should not be totally ruled out but at the same time should not be
embraced without totally exhausting every other option.''
   Murtha said the president listened intently but gave no
indication as to what he might do.
   ``It seemed a sense of urgency in the room. I felt that the
president feels that this is something he can't let sit ... There's
a real sense of urgency that something has to be done,'' said
Murtha.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said he was recommending a three-part
course of action: ``internationalize'' the issue by getting Latin
American allies to join in denunciations of Noriega; develop a
bipartisan consensus on U.S. action; and prepare the ``stricter
options'' the United States might take.
   ``Time is of the essence. There's a very brief period in which
world opinion will give us the environment in which we can take the
kind of action necessary to remove Noriega,'' said Graham.
   McCain suggested beefing up the U.S. bases in Panama with more
combatants, and not ruling out any military action. He said
military dependents should be moved out of the area, and U.S.
citizens there shoudl be warned there could be problems for them.
   ``We are deeply concerned by evidence pouring in of electoral
fraud on the part of the pro-Noriega forces,'' the State Department
said Monday night, joining members of Congress in criticizing the
elections.
   Bush brushed aside reporters' questions today as he sat down
with his observer team to get a firsthand report on what they saw
during and after Sunday's ballotting.
   Some 10,000 U.S. military personnel are based in Panama at
military installations which remain under U.S. control despite the
decade-old treaty that cedes control of the Panama Canal to that
Central American country at the end of the century.
   The official State Department statement, issued 24 hours after
the polls closed in Panama, appeared to lay the groundwork for an
official announcement that the United States was not prepared to
recognize the outcome of the election if the process was perceived
to be rigged in Duque's favor.
   President Bush indicated last week he would pursue that policy
rather than move toward a more normal relationship with the
Panamanian government.
   U.S. officials expected that Panamanian authorities at some
point will declare Duque the winner but some wondered whether
Noriega will be able to survive what they regard as an obvious
embarrassment for him.
   In addition to the allegations of fraud, the election day scenes
indicated strong backing for the opposition slate.
   Observers said members of the Noriega-led Defense Forces were
allowed to vote multiple times because, unlike other Panamanians,
they were not assigned to a specific voting station.
   ``People who were dead (were) all of a sudden reappearing on
rolls, when they had been dropped off,'' said Rep. Larry Smith,
D-Fla. ``So dead people could vote, but live people couldn't.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, ranking minority member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said the opposition appeared to be winning a
huge majority even though many of Noriega's supporters voted more
than once.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said the United States should
join with other hemispheric countries in applying diplomatic
pressure on Panama if the election outcome is based on fraud.
   U.S. officials saw the election as perhaps the best opportunity
in almost a year to achieve its goal of removing Noriega from
Panama's political life. He was indicted by a U.S. federal grand
jury last year on drug trafficking charges.
   Officials had hoped that the elections would become an event
around which Noriega's opponents could rally.

<HEAD>Mother Who Abandoned Son Wins Half of His Estate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Connecticut's Supreme Court reluctantly
ruled that a mother who abandoned her 2-year-old son is entitled to
half the $300,000 awarded his estate after the boy's death 13 years
later.
   Justice Robert J. Callahan said in a unanimous decision that
Suzanne Benson could collect $150,000 because state inheritance
laws do not distinguish between parents who abandon their children
and those who raise them.
   In a rare move, however, the Supreme Court recommended on Monday
that the Legislature change the law. Currently, a parent can be
denied half the estate only if parental rights have been formally
terminated after a court hearing.
   ``It does create an unjust situation,'' said attorney Kerin M.
Woods, who represented Kenneth Hotarek of Old Lyme, the boy's
father.
   Hotarek and Benson divorced when their son, Paul Hotarek, was 2.
He died at age 15 in 1986 when his bicycle collided with a car. The
father's insurance company paid a settlement to the boy's estate
because the motorist was underinsured.
   Benson, who had moved to Hurricane, Utah, learned of her son's
death 17 months later. She filed for half of the estate, as
provided by state law in cases of children who die without a will.
   Hotarek testified that from 1973 until their son's death, Benson
had no contact with their son and provided no financial or
emotional support.
   Attorney Edward B. O'Connell, who represented Benson, noted that
there was never a trial to determine whether Benson had in fact
abandoned her son.

<HEAD>Modernizing Missiles Will ``Cannibalize'' Lesser Forces, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of modernizing the nation's strategic
forces could result in ``internal budgeting cannibalism'' of
conventional forces if the Bush administration holds to current
plans, a private group said Tuesday.
   The Defense Budget Project estimated that spending for
development of such strategic weapons as the rail-garrison MX
nuclear missile, the Midgetman and the B-2 stealth bomber will
increase about 29 percent, in addition to increases to keep up with
inflation, through fiscal year 1996.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed zero
growth in the overall defense budget, including cuts of $10 billion
in fiscal 1990 to meet the compromise agreement reached by the
White House and Congress. Proposed growth in later years would
match inflation.
   ``Given budgetary constraints on defense, strategic forces must
compete with conventional forces for scarce funds,'' the report
said. ``If the defense budget as a whole is cut or grows only
enough to keep pace with inflation, the projected growth in funding
for strategic forces would come at the expense of funding for
conventional forces.''
   Dr. Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, called
the possible results ``internal budgeting cannibalism,'' and said
conventional forces and military readiness would pay the price.
   ``It would mirror what we did in the 1980s,'' Adams said in a
telephone interview.
   The Defense Budget Project is a non-profit research organization
that takes a critical look at Pentagon spending. The organization
was founded in 1983.
   In its 66-page report, ``Strategic Forces Funding in the 1990s:
A Renewed Buildup?'', the group said money for strategic forces can
be controlled by either eliminating weapons programs or slowing
production.
   The report recommends that the Bush administration and Congress
revise strategic modernization plans. The administration is
currently conducting a strategy review with a final report expected
later this month.
   Specifically, the report said a reduced reliance on
intercontinental ballistic missiles is the cheaper option while
mobility of the ICBMs is the most expensive.
   Cheney has proposed moving the 50 multiple-warhead, MX nuclear
missiles from their silos to railroad cars while spending $100
million on development of the single-warhead, Midgetman missile.
   The report also said that bombers are the most costly aspect of
strategic forces, and a decision must be made on whether to produce
the B-2 after acquiring the B-1B.
   Under the current budget proposal, production of the B-2 will be
pushed back a year to 1993 with almost $4.1 billion cut from the
fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the radar-evading plane.
   The report also said that funding demands for Star Wars can be
reduced by stressing long-term research rather than near-term
deployment. Cheney has proposed reducing funding for Star Wars by
$1 billion, and shifting the focus from deployment sometime in the
1990s to research on ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' a more advanced system
consisting of thousands of orbiting satellites.
   In addition, the report said that submarine-launched ballistic
missiles are the most cost-effective for delivering nuclear
warheads.
   It said a possible arms-reduction treaty, ``if successfully
negotiated, will provide an opportunity to reconsider strategic
policies and programs, but it will not, in itself, save large
amounts of money.''
   The report said such a treaty would allow current modernization
to continue ``with only minor reductions in the number of
submarines and missiles procured.''

<TEXT>
   Oregon farmers have planted 18 percent
less acres of strawberries this year because of fluctuations in the
migrant work force and complications of the new federal immigration
law.
   The harvest may cover even less acreage if more migrant pickers
don't arrive in the next few weeks for the June picking.
   This is the first full year officials can measure the effects of
the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which penalizes
growers who hire undocumented aliens, traditionally the largest
source of harvest workers. Employers face fines of $500 to $10,000
for each illegal worker and can be imprisoned after three
violations.
   While the numbers of both documented and undocumented workers
are increasing as the June strawberry harvest nears, far fewer
pickers have arrived than last year, when there was a surplus of
about 30,000 who were stranded without jobs, food or housing.
   Two years ago, a shortage of workers left 20 percent of the
strawberry crop to rot in the fields. Many migrant workers
mistakenly believed then that they would lose their chance for
legal residency if they were caught in the United States. Last
year, word of the previous year's shortage led to the surplus.
   What happens this year may largely determine the future of
Oregon's strawberry crop, the nation's second largest after
California.
   The Oregon Agricultural Statistical Service estimates 6,400
acres have been planted in strawberries, down from 7,800 acres the
past two years.
   ``Many farmers last year just decided it was not worth it to
grow strawberries knowing that the labor situation was uncertain,''
said Dalton Hobbs, spokesman for the Oregon Department of
Agriculture.
   Oregon's smaller production shouldn't have a significant impact
on the national strawberry crop, however. In California, the number
of acres planted in strawberries has increased 12 percent since
1987, to an estimated 19,000 acres this year.
   Danny Santos, manager of the migrant program for the Governor's
Commission on Agricultural Labor, estimated Oregon will need 40,000
workers to harvest this year's crop.
   Santos said better wages and living conditions must be provided
to attract a stable, and legal, labor force.
   ``We as a state must learn how to become more competitive in
getting workers,'' he said.
   Oregon has teamed with Washington and Idaho to form a regional
recruitment task force that works to secure an adequate labor
supply. The group is working with Texas officials on an exchange
program to make use of that state's large farm labor pool, and give
those workers more work, Santos said.
   Other actions include financing child care, health and education
programs, and providing grants to agencies that work to secure
better housing.
   ``If you provide services, you not only get a skilled labor
force, but a stable labor force,'' Santos said.
   Growers who in the past have failed to provide adequate wages
and housing will have a tough time getting their crops harvested,
said the Rev. David Ziegler of St. Alexander's Roman Catholic
Church in Cornelius, about 20 miles west of Portland.
   ``Growers talk about the immigration law, but they have to
accept responsibility for workers,'' he said.
   ``There are going to be a lot of growers who won't get their
crops picked,'' said Ron Taylor, overseer at Lloy-Dene Farms near
Cornelius.
   One worker, Eloy Aguirre of Mexico, said he still is waiting to
be paid for his work last year at Tankersley Farms in Washington
County. Owner Ron Tankersley is serving a jail sentence for using
illegal contractors. This year, Aguirre will work for Lloy-Dene.
   David Beebe, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service office in Portland, said the agency will
focus on growers who hire illegal workers, not on deporting those
without documentation.
   ``It's the difference between working hard and working smart,''
Beebe said.

   House Speaker Jim Wright today attacked the
ethics committee's outside counsel, accusing him of distorting
testimony in an effort to implicate the speaker on House rules
violations.
   Wright also charged that the ethics panel had permitted itself
to be misled by counsel Richard Phelan's selective use of evidence.
   Wright said his own lawyers had been ``profoundly shocked by the
lack of professionalism and prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy
contained in the Phelan report'' and called the committee's
investigation ``one sided.''
   But committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., defended the
panel's process and said its 12 members, six Democrats and six
Republicans, had studied original transcripts and not relied solely
on Phelan's report.
   Asked whether he was disturbed by Wright's strategy of attacking
Phelan, Dixon said he was not, but added: ``I'm glad you recognize
that that is the strategy.''
   At the same time, Wright's new legal defense team today prepared
motions asking that the two primary charges against him be
dismissed on grounds that the ethics committee's special counsel
has misread House rules.
   A source familiar with the defense said Wright's lawyers believe
they have a good chance of thinning the 69 formal counts of alleged
rules violations before Wright faces a trial-like disciplinary
hearing before the ethics panel.
   But the legal maneuvering appeared likely to further delay that
hearing, pushing it into June rather than late this month.
   Wright is charged with evading House limits on outside earned
income through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and with improperly
accepting some $145,000 in gifts from Fort Worth real estate
developer George Mallick, who has been deemed by the committee as
having a direct interest in legislation before Congress.
   But Wright's lawyers will argue that a strict reading of the
rules permits unlimited book royalties to be collected by a House
member. They also will try to make the case that Mallick helped
Wright not because of any interest in legislation, but because of
the longtime friendship between the two, and that such
relationships are protected by the rules.
   They will argue that the special counsel, Richard J. Phelan,
misread the history behind the rules and brought charges when none
were warranted. Phelan's charges amount to a rewriting of the
rules, the defense lawyers contend.
   In addition, the attorneys will seek to formally isolate Phelan
from the ethics panel that employed him by arguing he now takes on
the role of prosecutor and the committee should limit its private
contact with him to maintain objectivity.
   The hard-line approach reflects the toughness of Wright's new
legal team, which now includes Houston trial lawyer Stephen Susman;
former defense secretary and Democratic patriarch Clark Clifford;
Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.; Robert Altman, a Washington
attorney and associate of Clifford; and Neal S. Manne, a former
counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee who is a member of
Susman's firm.
   William C. Oldaker, who has handled the case for Wright thus
far, will continue to map out Wright's overall legal strategy,
along with co-counsels Lyn Utrecht and Eric Kleinfeld.
   Wright's campaign funds are paying the legal team's bill, a
permitted practice, said spokesman Mark Johnson.
   While the legal wrangling in Washington protracted, reports of
questionable financial dealings by Wright proliferated.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported today that Wright's wife,
Betty, did little or nothing to earn her $36,000 yearly salary at
the Seattle-based Pacific Institute, a firm which sells
motivational programs, primarily to corporate clients.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, Betty Wright, during my tenure here,
did nothing,'' said U.S. ``Tony'' French, a retired Army general
who was the institute's chief operating officer from November 1987
to May 1988.
   ``I am not comfortable with anybody in Pacific Institute telling
me they think she did a fair day's work. I'm not buying that.''
   An institute spokesman earlier had said Mrs. Wright did
``follow-up'' work with corporate clients, but was unable to offer
specific examples of her work.
   Some of the ethics counts against Wright are based on Mrs.
Wright's earlier receipt of an $18,000-a-year salary from Mallick
for which the special counsel could find little evidence that any
work was done.

   The city today turned over a public housing
project to its 3,500 tenants to run themselves in the first such
agreement in Chicago.
   Management of the 615-unit LeClaire Courts on the city's
Southwest Side changed hands at a ceremony attended by U.S. Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, Mayor Richard M. Daley
and city housing chief Vincent Lane.
   No prolonged celebrating was planned after the signing of the
three-year contract, the first such deal between the Chicago
Housing Authority and residents of a housing project.
   ``We haven't got much time. ... There's too much work still
ahead of us,'' said community activist Irene Johnson. ``It's just
that after six years of fighting the bureaucracy over this and
that, we can't wait to get started on our own.''
   In effect, the residential management corporation that wrested
control of LeClaire Courts from the government bureaucracy has
inherited an entire neighborhood.
   Tenant management also has been undertaken in recent years in
such cities as St. Louis, Cleveland, Washington and Boston.
   Unlike many of Chicago's public-housing projects, LeClaire
Courts is a complex of low-rise structures, most of them two-story
apartment buildings separated by wide lawns and residential streets.
   Tucked between huge industrial parcels, LeClaire and its
residents have yet to share in the modest resurgence of jobs and
businesses that increasing levels of airline traffic at nearby
Midway Airport have brought other neighborhoods.
   But tenant management could be the first step in that direction,
said Lane.
   ``Empowerment is going to mean several important things to the
people at LeClaire,'' he said.
   ``It's going to mean learning to live on a budget and headaches
if they hire the wrong janitor, the wrong accountant ... making the
hard decision about throwing Mrs. Jones' son out because he's
involved in drugs or a gang,'' Lane said.
   ``The burden for the quality of their lives is going to fall
squarely now on their shoulders. If you see people out there
planting grass, and neighbors looking after one another's kids,
making sure it's safe, kids going to job training and school ...
you know plenty of good things will follow.''
   The push toward tenant management began in 1980 when Mrs.
Johnson and some other LeClaire parents banded together to stop
further deterioration of the residences. But city and federal
housing officials turned a deaf ear.
   ``The first few times we dealt with the bureaucracy, I'm sure
they thought, `This group of poor, black women from the projects
will go away sooner or later,'' said Mrs. Johnson, the latest in a
long line of public-housing organizers that stretches nearly two
decades to Mildred Haley in Boston and through Bertha Gilkey in St.
Louis and Kimmy Gray in Washington.
   ``But the longer we stood our ground, the more respect we got.
And once we proved we could manage ourselves, I think they started
believing we could manage our own property.
   ``Now,'' added Mrs. Johnson, who has lived in the 615-unit
project since it opened 22 years ago and sent three children to
college, ``this dream is something we can put our hands on.''
   With improving organizational skills, the tenants began to find
small grants from private foundations and businesses, training a
few members at a time.
   By 1987, the group had applied enough pressure and impressed
enough people to obtain city and federal approval for their plan.
During the past year, they participated in joint management of the
project, receiving on-the-job training as well.
   ``It's been a long, long wait,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``But some
people around here have been waiting a lifetime for some hope.''

   A man who killed two children and wounded
nine other people in a shooting rampage at a school was sentenced
to the electric chair today.
   Judge James Moore imposed the death penalty rather than life in
prison on James Wilson 12 days after the 20-year-old pleaded guilty
but mentally ill to murder and other charges in the Sept. 26 attack
at Oakland Elementary School.
   Wilson, who had a history of mental disturbances from age 14,
walked in and opened fire with a handgun in a cafeteria and
classroom, killing Shequila Bradley and Tequila Thomas, both 8.
Seven students and two teachers also were wounded.
   Psychiatrists who examined Wilson agreed on a diagnosis of
borderline personality disorder, an illness bordering on
schizophrenia. Doctors testified he was fascinated with mass murder
and knew what he was doing was wrong but could not stop himself.
   The judge also sentenced Wilson to 175 years in prison for
aggravated assault, assault and battery and carrying a weapon onto
school grounds.
   Wilson was the first person sentenced to death under South
Carolina's 1984 guilty-but-mentally-ill law, said city Solicitor W.
Townes Jones IV.

   The man who pioneered the use of
electronic ankle bracelets to ease overcrowding at the county jail
is wearing one himself these days for misuse of funds.
   George Gallaugher, 40, brought the electronic devices to Lake
County a year ago as director of the county's Department of Court
Services.
   The bracelets send out an electronic signal that enables
authorities to know if a person leaves his assigned location. They
also allow jails to release nonviolent inmates and make room for
people accused of serious crimes.
   A grand jury accused Gallaugher of profiting from the bracelet
program, but the charge was dropped when he pleaded guilty earlier
this year to making personal use of about $15,000 in other public
funds.
   He was sentenced to 30 days and had served 12 days on
work-release Monday when his lawyer persuaded a judge to release
him with a bracelet ``like any other prisoner.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks aimed at ending a strike at four
copper mines broke off today just when a settlement appeared
imminent, and labor leaders blamed authorities for backing away
from promised wage increases.
   Authorities had promised to grant a 50 percent wage increase
demanded by the workers at the mines, said Solidarity spokeswoman
Barbara Hrybacz. The miners make between $118 and $176 monthly.
   She said that when the union bargainers returned to negotiations
to tell management that workers' had accepted the offer,
authorities changed the offer to only a 30 percent increase.
   The strike committee said it could not sign an agreement on
behalf of the workers and talks broke off, she said.
   The walkout has virtually shut down Poland's production of
copper, a crucial export. It is the biggest labor dispute since the
Solidarity trade union and the government signed a historic
cooperative accord on April 5.
   Workers went on strike Friday at the Lubin, Polkowice, Rudna and
Sieroszowice mines near the city of Lubin, 200 miles southwest of
Warsaw. The mines produce almost all of Poland's copper.
   Earlier, the official PAP news agency said a tentative accord
was reached by negotiators during ``difficult'' all-night talks at
the Lubin mine.
   A strike spokesman reached by telephone said strikers would be
polled on the agreement and that an end to the strike was near.
   The New Solidarity union newspaper said 15,000 miners were
supporting the strike that has affected a total of 20,000 workers.
   The strike has been a test of the wide-ranging agreement between
the communist government and Solidarity. The pact, which followed
two months of intense talks, resulted in the legalization of the
outlawed union and opposition participation in national elections.
   In return, Solidarity is to cooperate with the government on
economic reforms aimed at improving Poland's ailing economy. More
militant union splinter groups favor a more adversarial approach.
   The miners' strike committee included 10 members of the
independent Solidarity trade union, seven from the Communist
Party-dominated OPZZ union and 13 unaffiliated miners, Solidarity
said.
   Solidarity, which was the East bloc's first independent trade
union during its brief initial legal existence, was crushed during
the martial law crackdown of December 1981.
   Poland exported $233 million in copper to the West in 1987.

   The Pentagon said today the Defense Department
is monitoring closely the situation in Panama and had extended a
travel alert for the U.S. armed forces and their families following
U.S. charges of election fraud in last weekend's balloting..
   Chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said service personnel and
their dependents are being told to avoid travel around the country.
There are about 10,000 American troops based at military
installations in Panama.
   Howard also said the signal of the U.S. Southern Command's local
television station, operated for the benefit of American military
personnel and their dependents, was being jammed in Panama City. He
added the station and the Cable News Network had been yanked from a
local cable system in the capital.
   The spokesman declined to discuss military contingency planning,
saying no decisions involving troop movements or any other
operation had been made.
   ``We have a very uneasy situation in Panama,'' Howard observed.
``The turmoil obviously has created an unhealthy environment, not
only for Americans but Panamanians as well.''
   The United States charges that Panamanian strongman, Gen. Manual
Antonio Noriega, rigged the presidential elections Sunday in favor
of his candidate, Carlos Duque.
   American election observers met with President Bush today and
discussed options ranging from military intervention to increased
economic sanctions.

   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan promised today
to try to help cool the controversy in Wisconsin over Indian
spearfishing, which has prompted emotional confrontations between
members of the Chippewa tribe and sport fishermen.
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, at a meeting with Lujan, asked
that the federal government assist the state in trying to reach a
negotiated settlement with the Chippewas that might curtail the
practice by the Indians of spearfishing on land that once belonged
to them.
   The Indians hold the right to spearfish on the land under
treaties that date back more than a century, but sport fishermen
have loudly protested the practice, saying the practice cuts into
the number of fish they are allowed to catch.
   Protests in recent weeks resulted in scores of arrests.
   Lujan told the governor he will direct a senior department
official to look into what help the federal government might
provide. He said Pat Ragsdale, acting assistant secretary for
Indian affairs, will work with the governor and the Indians as to
what specific steps might be taken, spokesmen reported.
   After the meeting with Thompson and members of Wisconsin's
congressional delegation, the secretary issued a statement saying
he will ``explore means by which the (Interior) department could
facilitate efforts to achieve an agreement with the tribes that
would ease tensions (over the spearfishing) and avert future
conflicts.''
   Lujan provided no specific action that might lead to a
settlement.
   ``I don't think the tribes will want to give up spearfishing. I
really don't know what we'll be able to work out,'' said one
Interior official, speaking on condition that he not be identified
further.
   In addition to Thompson, those who attended the meeting with
Lujan were Sens. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., and Herbert Kohl,
D-Wis.; Democratic Rep. David Obey and Republican Reps. Steve
Gunderson and Toby Roth.
   Most of this spring's Chippewa spearfishing had ended last
weekend. Costs for protecting the Chippewa may total as much as $1
million, twice as much as last year, because of the larger groups
of spearfishing opponents that gathered at boat landings used by
the Indians, state officials say.
   There were more than 170 arrests, primarily of those who opposed
the Chippewa spearfishing that is permitted under 19th century
treaties. In some cases, protesters crossed police lines en masse
and were arrested. In others, they shouted obscenities or insults
with racial overtones.
   ``This has been a tough time in the state,'' Obey said Monday.
``What we need are a cooling down of tempers and a sobering up of a
lot of people.
   ``Everyone recognizes that this is a problem that has to be a
negotiated settlement.''
   He said the federal government can help the tribes focus
themselves on what they want.
   Obey said Indian disputes over land and fishing rights have been
settled through negotiation in Maine, Arizona and New York, and he
was confident the same could be done in Wisconsin.
   Federal court decisions since 1983 upheld rights of the Chippewa
to hunt, fish, trap and harvest wild grain from off-reservation
lands covering about the northern third of Wisconsin. The treaties
ceded that area to the United States.
   Opposition to tribal fishing grew this year when state officials
decided the planned Chippewa catch required cutbacks in daily catch
limits on walleyes taken by sport fishermen from lakes where
Indians had speared.
   Resort owners and other business people joined spearfishing
opponents in boat-landing demonstrations before the most active
spearfishing band, the Lac du Flambeau, announced Sunday it had
ended the spring season.
   The Lac du Flambeau does the most spearfishing of any of the six
bands and accounted for more than half of the 15,735 walleye that
had been caught by the Chippewa as of Monday. Tribal spokesmen
blamed cold spring weather for reducing the catch from the 25,974
taken last spring.
   By comparison, sport fishermen bagged an estimated 672,000
walleyes from the same area last year.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Says He Still Talks to Gorbachev Despite Criticism</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev accused him of being too
ambitious and had him fired from the Politburo, but Boris N.
Yeltsin says he still talks to _ and believes in _ the Kremlin
chief.
   Their rocky relationship has made headlines largely because
Yeltsin, one of the staunchest backers of Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness, also became its victim. His attacks on
the slowness of reform and the officials he believes are
responsible have put a dent in his political career he is only now
recovering from.
   Looking fit and tan from tennis, jogging and a vacation in the
Caucasus Mountains, the 58-year-old Yeltsin was as outspoken as
ever in a recent interview.
   He appeared buoyed by his landslide victory in the March 26
parliamentary elections, a win he scored despite a Communist Party
reprimand, a new party investigation into his views, and recent
publication of criticism of him by party officials including
Gorbachev.
   Yeltsin made clear his complaints about the slowness of reform
were not directed at Gorbachev but at those surrounding Gorbachev.
   Asked about his relationship with Gorbachev, the silver-haired
maverick from Sverdlovsk paused.
   ``Our relations are not as close as they were when I worked the
first year or so as first secretary of the Moscow city party
committee, before that as a Central Committee secretary,'' he
finally said.
   ``When we worked as first secretaries, I of the Sverdlovsk and
he of the Stavropol regional party committee, we maintained normal
human contact by phone and so forth. I would not say we were
friends, but we had normal relations. Then he supported me and all,
but after that _ not without someone's help _ a bit of a chill
started to creep in.''
   Now, he said, ``we meet, say hello, discuss things normally. You
can't say our relations are broken off. No. Not at all.''
   Yeltsin, interviewed in his State Construction Committee office
where he works as first deputy chairman, said he speaks to
Gorbachev by phone and sees him at party meetings.
   Gorbachev has made mistakes, he said, declining to elaborate. In
other public statements, Yeltsin has said he believes the Kremlin
chief made a tactical error by not making increased supplies of
food, consumer goods and housing the top priority of
``perestroika,'' or restructuring.
   Yeltsin said Gorbachev is a true reformer who is unhappy that
perestroika has not substantially improved people's lives. The
reason, Yeltsin believes, is that conservatives _ led by Politburo
member Yegor K. Ligachev, whom he refers to as ``my opponent'' _
are holding back reform.
   Yeltsin said some of the 10 others on the Politburo are tainted
by the legacy of the 18-year rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev,
an era now branded the ``period of stagnation.''
   ``They will never say it aloud, but they have been in the
highest echelons in the stagnation zone, safe from any criticism
for so long that I doubt if half of them could restructure
themselves and move perestroika energetically ahead,'' Yeltsin said.
   Gorbachev already has done some housecleaning on the ruling
body, dropping Andrei A. Gromyko, the man who ran foreign policy
during Brezhnev's rule, and Mikhail S. Solomentsev, the premier of
Russia during much of the Brezhnev period.
   Ligachev remains, and Yeltsin said a further shakeup is needed.
He declined to identify those he believes should be fired, saying
he'd get into even more trouble with the party. In March, the
policy-making Central Committee began investigating whether his
views conflict with the party line.
   Yeltsin said the committee's action in April to retire 110
top-ranking party officials, including many elderly holdovers from
the Brezhnev days, was only a partial solution. A full-scale
Central Committee purge can be made only at the next Communist
Party Congress in 1991, and Yeltsin suggested there be an
extraordinary session to weed out more oldtimers.
   Yeltsin said the Central Committee is more conservative than the
parliament to which he was just elected and it has made the party
the rear-guard instead of the vanguard of society. The new
parliament will include such reformers as human rights campaigner
Andrei D. Sakharov, economist Nikolai P. Shmelev and historian Roy
A. Medvedev.
   In a 1987 speech that led to his ouster as Moscow party boss and
removal from the Politburo, Yeltsin said consumers were concerned
perestroika had given them nothing, and he blasted Ligachev for
impeding reform. He has railed against the privileges granted the
Soviet elite and demanded more radical economic reform.
   Gorbachev himself has pushed gradually for more radical reform,
and in an April 25 speech acknowledged that shortages of housing,
food and basic consumer goods are growing despite perestroika.
   In a sense, Gorbachev is beginning to sound more and more like
Yeltsin.
   Asked whether he had simply aired his complaints too soon,
Yeltsin responded: ``I think he (Gorbachev) is late, moreover he is
of the very same opinion (as I am), but something prevents him from
showing himself more decisively to solve these problems.''
   He said later that he meant ``somebody'' was holding Gorbachev
back, mentioning Ligachev but declining to identify others.
   Last year, Gorbachev said he had brought Yeltsin into the
leadership in 1985 because he was ``an experienced, energetic
person with a critical approach.'' But, Gorbachev said, Yeltsin
resorted to ``shouting and command methods'' and ``went off into
high-flown talk, statements and administrative fiat.'' He also
accused Yeltsin of ``self-admiration.''
   Yeltsin said he was hurt by the criticism and wants the Central
Committee to annul a resolution it passed in 1987 branding his
speech ``politically erroneous.''
   ``It can't be called politically erroneous,'' he said somberly.
The resolution ``hangs on me even now .... Probably I will have to
wait for 28th Party Congress to raise this question.''
   Yeltsin also is angry about an investigation the Central
Committee launched during his election campaign into charges he
opposed party policies. One charge was that he supported breaking
the party's monopoly on political power. Yeltsin contends he has
simply called for discussion of a multiparty system.
   Asked about the inquiry, he snapped back that no commission
representative has interviewed him or asked for copies of his
speeches.
   ``Any criminal has a right to defense,'' he said.

   When the boys at No. 5 Fire Station went one
way, their microwave went the other.
   A false alarm reporting a house fire was called in to 911 Sunday
night, but firefighters found no such address and no fire, said
Fire Capt. Martin Devine. Upon returning to the station, they found
their microwave gone, he said.
   ``It looks like we were set up,'' he said.
   Devine said the thieves apparently entered through a rear door
that is occasionally left unlocked so police and other city
employees can use the restrooms.
   ``We always try to lock everything up when we leave,'' he said.
``But you have to go right away when you get a call. That's your
first priority.''
   Firefighters contacted 911 employees, who were able to trace the
false alarm call to a pay phone near the station, Devine said.
   Nothing but the microwave was taken.

<HEAD>Search for Heptachlor in Arkansas May Spread to Other States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department official said
Tuesday that all federally inspected poultry and hog slaughtering
plants in Arkansas have been put under ``intensified suveillance''
for traces of the cancer-causing pesticide heptachlor.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said the agency may ``expand testing
into surrounding states'' over the next few weeks. The intensified
surveillance program for heptachlor in Arkansas began on Monday, he
said.
   The USDA agency has been monitoring Arkansas slaughter plants
since January for traces of heptachlor after finding contaminated
poultry at Townsends of Arkansas in Batesville, he said.
   ``We also began suveillance testing in other poultry and
red-meat slaughtering plants in Arkansas to determine if the
heptachlor problem extended beyond Townsends,'' Crawford said.
``Regrettably, we found additional problems.''
   One hog tested positive for heptachlor at unacceptable levels,
and two others showed traces of the chemical. Meanwhile, he said,
the Food and Drug Administration reported unacceptable heptachlor
levels in non-commerial egg samples.
   Contaminated feed is the suspected cause, although the FDA has
not been able to determine the specific source. At least four feed
mills have been under investigation.
   Crawford said his agency will inform the FDA ``whenever actual
or potential violations are detected through our testing.''
Meanwhile, the FDA will attempt to determine who bought the
contaminated feed. After that, Crawford said his inspectors will
test animals from those producers.
   ``The problems occurring with heptachlor are disturbing,'' he
said. ``Heptachlor has been shown to induce tumors in mice. In
1978, the Environmental Protection Agency banned heptachlor for all
agricultural uses except as a seed treatment, but it is apparent
from the problems we're finding now that residues from treated seed
persist in food animals.''
   Crawford said the problem will not be resolved until the
practice of using chemically treated seed as animal feed is
stopped. ``We are very encouraged by the EPA announcement that they
will ban the future use of heptachlor on treated seed,'' he added.

   A suspected bank robber tossed handfuls of
cash from his car while police chased him on a freeway, then
ditched the car and ran into a store in an unsuccessful attempt to
hide, police said.
   The man climbed into an attic crawl space that couldn't hold his
weight.
   ``The (store) employee heard a big thud upstairs. She looked up
over a balcony and saw a guy's head,'' police Lt. Frank
Semelsberger said Monday.
   The frightened employee at the Discoveries jewelry and craft
gallery fled the store, Semelsberger said, and police moved in with
a dog.
   Eric Raymond Martin, 22, of San Diego, surrendered at first
sight of the dog and was booked for investigation of robbery, he
said.
   Martin allegedly robbed Far West Savings And Loan Association,
then drove away on the traffic-clogged Costa Mesa Freeway, tossing
money frm his car as police followed, said Semelsberger.
   Sgt. Bill Fisher said Tuesday that less than $4,000 was taken
from Far West and all but about $800 had been recovered.

<TEXT>
   The astronauts who rode the space
shuttle Atlantis on a four-day mission returned to work Tuesday to
begin reviewing their flight, highlighted by the deployment of a
planetary probe to Venus.
   Their mission ended Monday when the 97-ton shuttle dropped out
of orbit and glided to an afternoon landing at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif. Atlantis remained at Edwards and initial inspections
showed little damage to the thermal tiles that protect it from the
heat of re-entry.
   While the astronauts returned to work, the Magellan probe they
deployed in orbit, where its own rocket engine was fired,
maintained a nearly perfect course for Venus. It will travel 806
million miles and loop 1{ times around the sun before reaching
Venus in August 1990.
   NASA officials praised the five astronauts' efforts in deploying
Magellan, the nation's first planetary probe in 11 years and the
first ever to ride a shuttle into space.
   ``Obviously this mission was an outstanding success,'' NASA
science chief Lennard Fisk told reporters at Edwards.
   The astronauts _ commander David Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe, and
mission specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard _
returned home to Houston late Monday and were welcomed at Ellington
Field by about 200 people.
   ``It's really nice to have the mission finished and we couldn't
have done it without you,'' Ms. Cleave told the crowd.
   She said the astronauts had a great time and that it was good to
know that a spacecraft was en route to Venus and ``we were all a
part of it.''
   The astronauts went to work Tuesday at the Johnson Space Center
reviewing photographs taken during their 1.68-million-mile journey.
On Wednesday, they will undergo physicals and begin discussing the
mission in depth with NASA officials.
   The only problem reported during the Atlantis flight, the fourth
since shuttle flights resumed Sept. 29, 1988, was Sunday's failure
of one of four redundant computers that control the shuttle's
systems.
   The crew was able to restart the computer but ground controllers
decided not to trust it for re-entry. The crew abandoned other
tasks and spent 4{ hours replacing the faulty computer with a
spare, the first time that had been done in orbit.
   The shuttle could land with just one computer operating,
according to NASA.
   Before the computer failure, the astronauts worked on an
experiment involving crystallizing a metal sample in a small
furnace and photographed lightning and pollution on Earth. The
weight of Magellan and its booster rocket _ 45,000 pounds _ had
limited the number of experiments the orbiter could carry.
   Once Magellan reaches Venus, it will use its high resolution
radar to map up to 90 percent of the planet's surface. The
$550-million mission should help scientists learn more about how
Venus evolved so differently from the Earth.
   Images obtained by Magellan are expected to show features as
small as a football field; that would be 10 times cleared than
pictures acquired by earlier radar spacecraft.

<TEXT>
   Congress approved a five-year extension of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission on Tuesday and
sent the legislation to President Bush, who has indicated he will
sign it.
   The House, on a vote of 359-42, passed the bill in the same form
approved by the Senate last week on a vote of 90-7. The measure
gives the commission a five-year budget of $1.5 million.
   Last month, the House had approved a bill to make the commission
permanent, with a yearly budgt of $500,000. The commission has
received no federal appropriation since its creation in 1984.
   The final version of the bill authorizes the commission to spend
$300,000 annually in federal funds for five years. Separate
legislation appropriating the money will be required before the
panel gets its first infusion from the Treasury.
   The bill prohibits the commission from spending any money to
train individuals to enagage in the protest or civil disobediance
activities that King popularized in the civil rights movement.
   The commission was established to promote state, national and
international activities relating to the observance of the federal
holiday in honor of King, who was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn.,
in 1968.
   The original legislation authorizing the commission expired
April 30.

   A Swiss company has dropped its plans
to build a chemical plant in Iran that officials feared might be
used to make poison gas, authorities said Tuesday.
   The action came at the request of the Swiss government, a
foreign ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
   The Swiss company, Krebs A.G., had been negotiating with Iran to
build a pesticides and fertilizer plant.
   Although Iran had a legitimate interest in producing
agricultural chemicals, using the factory for chemical weapons
could not be ruled out, the official said.
   In March, Krebbs pulled out of a chemical plant project in Egypt
also at the Swiss government's behest.
   Swiss laws restrict the export of chemicals that could be used
for poison gas. Equipment that could help make chemical weapons is
not restricted, but the government is studying whether to impose
export controls.

   The Defense Department said Tuesday it wanted
to see the V-22 Osprey aircraft project shut down ``in an orderly
manner'' but had no intention of providing any more federal funds
to the two contractors involved.
   Reiterating Friday's announcement that no more money would be
forthcoming for the project, the department said the political
outcry after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's decision to terminate
the program was ``not unexpected.''
   ``I think that if we were dealing with a real turkey here, you'd
have a different situation,'' Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief
spokesman, said Tuesday. ``But the secretary acknowledged the fact
that this is a good program.
   ``The decision (to terminate) was based on the secretary's
judgment that the only way you can cut the budget is to cut the
budget. That means that something has to come out.''
   On Friday, the two contractors developing the plane for the
Marine Corps announced they were temporarily suspending their
threat to begin layoffs in order to pursue further negotiations
with military officials.
   The contractors _ Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. and the Boeing
Helicopter Co. _ have said they don't want to pour any more of
their money into the V-22 this year if the decision to cancel the
program in the next fiscal year stands.
   The issue of corporate money arises because the Pentagon already
has paid the two companies all the money they're due in fiscal 1989
and the contractors are facing overruns that total about $25
million a month.
   Howard repeated Tuesday that Cheney intends to kill the program
in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, but fully expects the
contractors to complete work required under the fiscal 1989
contract.
   The Pentagon spokesman said there had been some additional
discussions with company executives, but declined to elaborate.
   Terry Arnold, a Bell spokesman, declined comment except to say
the contractors were still discussing the situation with Pentagon
officials.
   ``In the meantime, our status hasn't changed,'' Arnold said.
``It's a day-by-day decision on continuing work and we're still
working right now.''
   The V-22 Osprey, described by the Marine Corps as its most
important weapons program, is a revolutionary aircraft designed to
take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. To do this, it
utilizes special propellers at the tip of each wing that can swivel
upward and back.
   The Marine Corps wants to use the planes to improve its ability
to conduct surprise, long-range amphibious assaults. The first of
the planes just recently began flight tests in Texas.
   Cheney, in fashioning a fiscal 1990 military budget to honor a
White House-Congress budget compromise, two weeks ago announced $10
billion in cuts to the original spending plan of the Reagan
administration.
   In making those cuts, Cheney ordered the Osprey program canceled
outright, saying that the Pentagon simply couldn't afford the plane
and that the Marine Corps could do just as well by ordering
additional _ and cheaper _ helicopters.
   The Pentagon had planned to spend $25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys,
including $1.3 billion in 1990. The department has already invested
$2 billion in the program over a nine-year period.
   Of all of Cheney's budget-cutting decisions, the cancelation of
the Osprey has attracted the most intense opposition on Capitol
Hill. The plane is built in the district of House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, and enjoys widespread support among Republicans.
   Howard said that if Bell and Boeing failed to complete the work
required in the fiscal 1989 contract, they could face government
legal proceedings to recover $200 million to $300 million.

   An argument between a man and his wife
apparently led to a shooting spree in which two policemen were
killed before the suspect was killed by his son.
   Officers Bill Patterson and Wayne Henebry were killed by shotgun
blasts Monday night, apparently when they tried to serve a warrant
on ex-convict Howard Polk Sr. of Columbia, authorities said.
   Polk, 51, died later about three blocks away after his
19-year-old son used his car to pin the shotgun-wielding older man
against a pickup and then emptied a pistol at him, said District
Attorney Richard Douglass. No charges were filed against the son.
   Douglass said the rampage apparently resulted from an argument
Polk had with his wife.
   ``Evidently, they had an altercation and she made out charges,''
Douglas said. ``I assume it was some kind of assault. When he found
out about it, he sent word through some means that he would get her
and the law officers that had the warrant.''
   Douglass said Henebry and Patterson had responded to a domestic
disturbance call at the home of Polk's wife, but Polk had left by
the time the officers arrived and they headed back to the
courthouse.
   The officers' bodies were later found outside their patrol cars
near the courthouse, where they had encountered Polk, Douglass said.
   Apparently, both officers shot at Polk when he got out of his
truck firing his shotgun.
   ``I believe they knew he was dangerous,'' Douglass said. ``They
weren't trying to gun him down. They were just trying to do their
job.''
   He said Henebry was shot in the back of his head and Patterson
was shot in the face and head.
   While officers were rushing to the site of the shootings, they
received reports of a nearby disturbance. ``He (Polk) came back ...
and went to the house where his wife's relatives live,'' Douglass
said.
   He said witnesses reported that Polk stopped his truck and got
out, brandishing a shotgun. ``At the time, a member of the family
rammed him with a car and pinned him against the truck,'' he said.
   Douglass said the family member was Polk's son, Howard Polk Jr.
   ``There were a number of bullet wounds in his (elder Polk's)
body,'' Douglass said. ``The boy said he fired all the bullets in
his gun.'' He said one bullet in the 9-shot .22-caliber pistol did
not fire.
   Douglass said Howard Polk Jr. was questioned and released.
   ``It does not look like there will be charges,'' he said. ``He
made the statement to his son, `I'm going to go take care of these
papers and then I'm going to take care of you.'''
   Polk had a record in Marion County dating to the 1960s, said
Marion County Circuit Clerk Joe Herring.
   He served a prison sentence in the 1970s after pleading guilty
to a charge of manslaughter, reduced from murder, in a 1971 killing
in neighboring Lamar County, said Chief Lamar County Deputy Yancey
Saucier.

<TEXT>
   A judge today barred the city transit agency
from raising fares on subways, buses and trolleys until a higher
court decides whether the poor got a fair chance to be heard.
   Common Pleas Judge Samuel Lehrer rejected a plea from the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority that the agency
would suffer irreparable financial harm if the increase didn't take
effect Thursday.
   Under the new fare schedule, the cost of tokens _ which riders
buy in bulk _would go from 85 cents to $1 for the agency's 1
million weekday rides. The basic cash fare, $1.25 since 1986, would
not change.
   SEPTA had wanted to raise fares April 9, but community groups
argued that the agency, during public hearings, did not adequately
take into consideration the effect on the poor. Lehrer agreed at
the time and blocked the increases.
   Today, SEPTA argued it had the right put the increases into
effect pending a hearing June 7 in Commonwealth Court, but Lehrer
disagreed.
   SEPTA attorney David Bruton had argued that the system is losing
$60,000 to $80,000 a day without the increase.

<HEAD>Bush Visits Day Care Center to Show Opposition To Senate Measure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush visted a Baptist day care
center Tuesday to dramatize his opposition to Democratic-sponsored
legislation headed for Senate action.
   Bush hinted that Washington's Shiloh Baptist Church child
development center might be denied federal help under a bill by
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., because of its religious
affiliation.
   A spokesman for Dodd disputed the contention.
   Dodd's measure, due for Senate debate later this week or next
week, would provide $2.5 billion to states to directly assist
individuals and centers that provide child care.
   Bush has proposed a rival measure that would give assistance to
working parents rather than to child-care providers. His measure,
so far ignored by Congress, calls for $1,000 tax credits for
low-income working parents for each child under age 4.
   ``My thought is to help the parents with choice. If they want to
send a kid to this facility, fine, give them a little help _ those
that need it the most. If they want to go to some other kind of
facility where there's no relgious reference, fine, let them do
that too,'' Bush told officials of the child care center.
   Without mentioning it by name, Bush suggested the Dodd bill was
overly restrictive and ``leans over so far backwards on this
separation of church and state that you just erode out the
participation of one of the best forces in the community for
teaching these kids values.''
   Jason Issacson, a Dodd spokesman, insisted funds under Dodd's
bill would still be available to church-affiliated child-care
centers which, like the Shiloh center, did not stress religious
education.
   He said that a majority of the nation's church-affiliated day
care centers probably fall into this category and would thus be
eligible for the grants.
   Bush met briefly with a group of children attending the Shiloh
center and bantered with them.
   One asked him who he was.
   ``I am the president of the United States of America,'' Bush
said. The child looked dubious.
   ``Don't you believe that? There, see?'' he said, showing the
youth his presidential tie clasp.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia is striving for press freedom and
does not deserve to be called an East bloc ``bad guy,'' a
Czechoslovak diplomat said Tuesday at a meeting to improve
information between East and West.
   Ambassador Dusan Spacil, who is based in West Germany, said
Western countries that criticize his country's record on press
rights are biased and speak from ``pre-programmed thinking.''
   Canada and the United States have accused Czechoslovakia and
other East bloc participants of violating or ignoring an
international agreement on press and other freedoms signed by 35
nations in Vienna in January.
   The aim of the London forum, which ends this week, is to monitor
compliance with the agreement.
   ``Whatever problems do exist, don't exist only in socialist
countries, but also in Western countries,'' said Spacil, who is
heading the Czech delegation.
   ``What we do consider unjust, especially in the Western
information media and also during this conference, were one-sided,
biased views,'' he said.
   ``There is pre-programmed thinking. This includes the fiction
that there are good and bad socialist states according to how they
apply `perestroika' and `glasnost,' and if they don't apply it
according to the pre-programmed thinking, then they are the bad
guys,'' he said referring to the Soviet policies of economic and
political reforms and openness applied in varying degrees in the
East bloc.
   However Spacil, a former ambassador to the United States, said
he believed most delegates were cooperative and understanding.
   Earlier at the forum, Canadian Ambassador William Bauer compared
the propaganda techniques and state-controlled media of Romania,
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany to Nazi Germany.
   Chief U.S. delegate Leonard H. Marks singled out the same four
nations for criticism, saying they had yet to fulfill the Vienna
agreement.
   Spacil said ``glasnost'' has permeated his country's media.
Newspapers carry articles criticizing official speeches, they
reprint foreign articles without commentary and are more widely
available, he said.
   But he said his government could not immediately hurry into
place all the changes needed to comply with the accord, which he
said maintains that ``national laws have to be respected.''
   ``We are in this process, adjusting our national laws to the
requirements of Vienna,'' Spacil said.
   He cited as an example that Czechoslovakia is changing its rules
to enable foreign journalists to obtain visas immediately,
beginning in the next two months.

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Tuesday
the United States should resume ``significant military aid'' to
Contra rebels in Nicaragua if the government there fails to hold
and abide by free elections.
   Dole, in comments to the Commission on Free and Fair Elections
in Nicaragua, said he is not optimistic about balloting in
Nicaragua, particularly in light of ``the sham of a new election
law'' he said had been adopted by that nation's leaders.
   The commission is a privately financed group made up of three
Democrats and three Republicans and established by the World
Freedom Foundation, headed by prominent conservative L. Brent
Bozell III.
   Former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., co-chairman of the
commission, said the panel hopes to establish guidelines and
encourage the holding of free elections.
   ``It will then be up to Daniel Ortega,'' Nicaragua's president,
he said. ``If he is sincere about his commitment to holding
elections in Nicaragua early next year, he can accept our work and
use it as a guide in implementing the reforms he has promised since
he took office in 1979.''
   The other co-chairman, Curtin Winsor Jr., ambassador to Costa
Rica in the Reagan administration, also said, ``The choice will
ultimately be made by Nicaragua's Sandinista government. I hope to
join with my colleagues in offering them a clear blueprint for
democratic commitment. ... Theirs will be the right to use it, or
to give their people less than they have offered them.''
   Ortega has signed an accord with four other Central American
nations in which he promised electoral and other legal reforms to
ensure fair general elections, which are to be held in February.
Last week, his government rejected an opposition demand to
negotiate further reforms.
   The Nicaraguan leader has been on a tour of European capitals to
seek additional economic aid for his country's troubled economy.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, in response
to questions Tuesday, indicated the administration has been
encouraging the Europeans to hold off on such aid.
   ``Our position on assistance to the Nicaraguans is well known.
We believe that economic assistance should be closely linked to
Sandinista compliance with their promises to hold free, fair and
honest elections,'' Boucher said.
   Dole told the commission he hopes for free elections ``but,
candidly, I am not very optimistic.''
   ``The record so far _ as manifest, for example, in the sham of a
new election law recently promulgated by the comandantes _ is
hardly encouraging,'' the Kansas Republican said.
   ``What if next February comes and goes, and there is no free
election, perhaps not even any election?'' Dole asked. ``What if
the Sandinistas `win' the election through fraud, or lose the
elelction but refuse to yield power?
   In that event, he said, ``I hope that we will articulate and
implement a policy that will apply direct and effective pressure on
the Sandinistas, including through the resumption of significant
military aid to a revitalized democratic resistance.''
   President Bush, in the face of congressional resistance to
continuing the Reagan policy of military aid to the Contras,
recently reached a bipartisan agreement providing for non-military
assistance subject to review by congressional committees. The Bush
administration has abandoned plans to seek immediate military aid.
   John Silber, president of Boston University, told the
commission, ``I do not see anything in the upcoming elections but
an opportunity to delude ourselves. I believe we are in a corner,
waiting for the paint to dry.''
   However, Allen Weinstein, president of the Center for Democracy,
said the Nicaraguan government recognizes it is under intense
international pressure to achieve acceptable ground rules for the
February balloting.
   The center is a Washington-based policy institute that has been
invited by both the Nicaraguan govermnent and its opposition to
send observers to monitor preparations for the election.

<HEAD>Officials Say Calls For Arms Talks Envisage A Unified Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government officials insist West
Germany's aggressiveness in a NATO missile feud signals its hopes
for a unified Europe, not an indication it plans to leave the
Western alliance.
   Bonn sparked major infighting with its demand for negotiations
on reducing short-range nuclear weapons, saying NATO should take up
every opportunity for talks on disarmament.
   The United States and Britain say such talks can be dangerous
because of the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional forces.
NATO's short-range nuclear weapons, most of which are in West
Germany, act as a deterrent against possible attacks on alliance
forces, they say.
   Washington officials say the United States probably would be
forced to withdraw its troops from West Germany if the Bonn
government went so far as to ban short-range nuclear weapons from
its soil.
   The feud has led some American observers to wonder whether West
Germany's insistence on pursuing a major internal battle shows a
weakness in its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   But Bonn government officials insist they remain committed to
the Western alliance, and that disarmament negotiations help reduce
tensions between East and West and present no threat to NATO.
   Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union, said reducing armaments in Europe ``to
the lowest levels'' would help make it possible for ``East and West
to lose the fear they have of one another.''
   ``This is the grand goal that guides us: unity and freedom for
all of Germany in a united, free Europe from Poland to Portugal, a
Europe that would serve as a peace bridge between the United States
and the Soviet Union,'' Dregger told parliament Tuesday.
   Another Christian Democrat, who asked not to be further
identified, said fears that West Germany plans to abandon the
alliance stem at least partially from a sharp lack of understanding
in the United States of the situation in Europe.
   ``We have to do a lot to have a better understanding of what's
going on in Europe and in Germany,'' said the official.
   ``It is very clear that we Germans are working for common
security in the Western alliance, and on the basis of common
security we are looking for dialogue and better relations with the
East.''
   Nevertheless, even some West German political analysts say Kohl
made a colossal error by insisting on a fight with the United
States and Britain over short-range nuclear weapons.
   Thomas Ender, a specialist at Bonn's German Institute for
Foreign Affairs think tank, said he fears Bonn's eagerness to
please voters could seriously damage the alliance.
   ``Chancellor Kohl is tempted to confront the United States
because that may please the voters since it makes him look
strong,'' Ender said in an interview. ``But I am worried this could
lead to a major break within NATO.''
   There is a strong anti-military mood in West Germany, a factor
which apparently prompted Kohl to target short-range nuclear
missiles in the face of predictions he could lose next year's
election.
   ``This is a very narrow-minded and dangerous game to be playing.
The utmost West German national interest is to keep a strong
alliance with the United States'' Ender said.
   The conservative newspaper Die Welt on Tuesday echoed Ender's
worry, saying it is a ``serious mistake'' for West Germany to
attempt to pit other continental European allies against the United
States and Britain in the missiles dispute.
   Kohl's government often claims the support of six continental
European NATO allies in its attempt to persuade Washington and
Whitehall of the need for disarmament talks.
   Die Welt said ``only time will tell'' whether the NATO feud is
``the start of a distancing between North America and Western
Europe, between Britain and the continent.''

   The government paid the first monthly
benefit Tuesday to the heirs of more than 2,000 adults who died in
the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, as ordered by the Supreme Court.
   Government funds are being used pending resolution of legal
challenges to a $470 million settlement by Union Carbide Corp. of
Danbury, Conn. An Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide operated the
Bhopal plant.
   Bank accounts opened in the names of the heirs were credited
with the first monthly payments of 750 rupees ($50) each.
   Members of the Bhopal Gas Affected Women's Organization held a
silent demonstration outside a building where officials presented
the heirs with bank documents.
   Protesters carried placards and banners accusing the government
of trying to take credit for the compensation program.
   Abdul Jabbar Khan, organizer of the group, said: ``We want to
tell the victims that it is because of the Supreme Court and not
the munificence of the government that they are getting the money.
There was no need to hold such a function. This only shows the
government wants to use the occasion for electoral purposes.''
   At least 3,400 people were killed and more than 20,000 injured
when toxic gas leaked from the Bhopal pesticide plant on Dec. 2,
1984.
   Union Carbide was ordered in February to pay $470 million, under
a settlement supervised by the Supreme Court during the hearing of
a $3 billion damage suit filed by the government.
   Payment was delayed after several petitions challenged the
government's right to represent the victims.
   Another bench of the court ordered monthly payment of interim
relief pending a decision on the legal petitions. The amount paid
is to be deducted from the final compensation award.

<HEAD>Industry Seeks U.S. Aid; Mosbacher Says Uncle Sam No `Uncle Sugar'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. electronics industry on Tuesday
released a plan proposing more than $1.3 billion in government aid
to help America catch up in the global race to develop
high-definition television technology.
   But Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said U.S. manufacturers
shouldn't depend on Uncle Sam to be their ``Uncle Sugar'' in
bankrolling the effort.
   High-definition television, which offers the promise of sharper,
brighter and wider pictures, is expected to be in full operation in
Japan by the mid-1990s. The U.S. telecommunications industry has
barely begun testing the technology.
   Pat Hill Hubbard, vice president of the American Electronics
Association, told a Senate committee that if the United States
fails to catch up, ``the effects on our economy may be drastic''
and would adversely affect a range of industries, including
semiconductors, software and automated manufacturing equipment.
   ``We must gain an industry to retain many industries,'' she said.
   The association released a proposal developed by the Boston
Consulting Group that calls for $1 billion in loans and loan
guarantees for U.S. companies that join together to manufacture and
market the television technology.
   The plan also proposes $300 million over three years to promote
high-definition TV research at the Pentagon and $50 million more
for related work at the Commerce Department. The proposal calls for
matching investments and initiatives from interested businesses.
   Mosbacher, testifying earlier, said the Bush administration had
not yet decided on its role in fostering the new technology, but
said he had ``serious doubts about throwing money at the problem.''
   ``I think, frankly, the problem is that they are hoping ...
Uncle Sugar will fund it and I don't think they should depend on
that,'' Mosbacher said. ``It's got to be that the private sector
will still take the lead.''
   Mosbacher reiterated his previous statements that the
administration hopes to promote America's industrial
competitiveness by extending research and development tax credits
and reducing the capital gains tax rate.
   He also said the administration is considering easing antitrust
restrictions to allow U.S. companies to work together to develop
new technologies.
   IBM Corp. Vice Chairman J.D. Kuehler, said the core question
related to development of high-definition television is ``whether
or not this country wants to get into the development and the
manufacturing of consumer electronics,'' now largely the territory
of Japanese companies.
   ``HDTV has become the symbol of or the last bastion of or the
best opportunity ... to put this country into the role of a
provider of consumer electronics,'' Kuehler said.
   The committee chairman, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said he
was ``embarrassed'' for Mosbacher because of his lack of specific
recommendations for advancing HDTV and U.S. industrial
competitiveness.
   Hollings praised the HDTV proposal released by the electronics
association and said the suggested amounts of government assistance
included in the plan were ``in the ballpark,'' given the head start
that the Japanese have in HDTV technology.

<HEAD>Report Alleges Thousands of Pets Trapped, Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report alleging that two private animal
welfare groups used the Oregon Humane Society's shelter to kill
thousands of trapped stray dogs and cats has shocked the society's
board and angered pet owners.
   The report was made public Saturday, the day before national
``Be Kind to Animals Week'' began.
   The report also contended animals were neglected and abused at
the shelter, that poor records were kept and that large amounts of
sodium pentabarbital, the lethal compound used to euthanize
animals, were missing.
   The society's board ``had no idea,'' Humane Society President
Dolorosa Margulis said. ``It was an absolutely outrageous shock.''
   The Humane Society's executive director, Patrick E. Sweeney, and
general manager, Alan Thomas, were fired after consultant Brad
Quinn Post submitted the report.
   Sweeney has declined to comment. Thomas has not returned phone
calls.
   The practice of trapping and killing strays became so widespread
that forms designed for detailed information from one pet owner
often listed as many as 44 unspecified animals or said simply, ``21
collies, or 12 labradors,'' according to the report.
   ``There is no basis for knowing, retrospectively, how many, if
any, of these animals were in fact missing, with owners perhaps
frantically looking for their pets,'' Post wrote.
   Humane Society board members said the two animal welfare groups
_ Animal Aid Inc. and Citizens for Humane Education _ had trapped
and killed as many as 32,000 animals, 80 percent of them cats, at
the shelter since 1981.
   ``Not any member of the board knew this was going on,'' Margulis
said.
   However, she discounted that pets could easily have been among
the trapped animals.
   ``You very easily can distinguish a wild cat that is
malnourished, from a cat that's a pet and just lost,'' Margulis
said. ``A feral cat is a very mean cat.''
   ``We have a cat crisis in the county,'' said Mike Oswald, head
of Multnomah County Animal Control. He said the blame for the high
number of animals killed rests with pet owners who fail to spay or
neuter their cats.
   He said the county has about 125,000 cats and 561,000 people.
   Only 3 percent of the cats are licensed and the rest are the
property of ``casual owners'' who let them run loose, Oswald said.
   Oswald said he didn't know why so many animals were killed at
the Humane Society and not taken to the county shelter. Most
probably would have been put to death at the county shelter as
well, but the county also has strict regulations on proof of
ownership before an animal is killed.
   Animal Aid and Citizens for Humane Education issued a statement
saying they had worked openly with the Humane Society and that they
trapped only stray animals that never had a home.
   Margulis denied that the two groups had worked openly together.
But she did praise Animal Aid for its local lost-and-found hotline,
which reunites pets with their owners.
   Post's report also pointed out that the Humane Society manager
had created no written procedures for shelter operations. Post laid
partial blame on the board of trustees, which he said ``had also
failed to develop clear-cut directives or mandates that management
could meaningfully employ.''
   Although they had no veterinary training, Post said, staffers
appeared confident about their ability to diagnose illnesses.
   ``Animals are routinely euthanized because of slight coughs or
occasional sneezing without any other overt indications of
disease,'' he said, and also charged that animals were killed
simply for having ear mites.

<HEAD>More Than 3 Million Betting on Visa Lottery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 3 million people from around the
globe have won a chance to take part in a computerized ``visa
lottery'' that will give 20,000 immigrants the opportunity to live
in the United States, the State Department announced Tuesday.
   ``The so-called `visa lottery' is now over _ 3.2 million people
applied successfully,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters.
   Boucher said winners will be chosen by a computer which will
make the selections on a random basis.
   Citizens from 162 countries were eligible to apply during March
and all applicants have an equal chance of winning an immigrant
visa.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., author of the legislation that
made the new program possible, ``will open the first few
application envelopes selected by the computer and announce the
nationalities of the applicants'' at a ceremony Monday, Boucher
said.
   ``He will be the first person to match the computer numbers with
the (application) envelopes,'' said Frances Jones, an official with
the department's counsular affairs office.
   Only the nationalities and not the names will be announced at
the ceremony ``as a courtesy'' to the privacy of the applicants,
Ms. Jones said.
   Those who do win a visa and come to the United States could
apply for citizenship later if they meet the strict criteria for
that status, Ms. Jones added.
   Under the program, 10,000 visas will be granted each year for
1991 and 1992.
   Berman said the program would bring diversity to the immigrant
population.
   Under the normal rules for obtaining an immigrant visa, the
applicant has to have a close relative in the United States or work
in a scarce profession.
   The program touched off a near-tempest at posts around the
world, primarily because it opened the way for nearly anyone to
come the United States.
   Since the program was announced in February, U.S. embassies and
diplomatic posts overseas were besieged with queries.
   Telephones rang constantly and embassy entry ways were snarled
at posts ranging from Cairo, Egypt, to Bucharest, Romania, as
people lined up for information.
   But winning the lottery doesn't automatically gain applicants
entry _ they must also meet the basic requirements for entry, such
as good health and no criminal contacts.
   The last lottery for visas was held in 1986. It was more
restrictive than the current program and allowed only 10,000 visas,
with some 1.4 million applicants losing out.
   The countries excluded from the program were those that used
more than 5,000 immigrant slots in fiscal 1988.
   They were China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador,
Guyana, Haiti, India, Jamaica, South Korea, Mexico, the Philippines
and the United Kingdom.
   Also excluded were natives of Taiwan, Anguilla, Bermuda, British
Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Hong
Kong, Monteserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, and the Turks and Caicos
Islands.

   Bombs exploded before dawn Tuesday at
courthouses in Duesseldorf and Muenster, causing damage but no
injuries, police said.
   No group claimed responsibility for either attack.
   A bomb tore a hole in the roof, blew out windows and caused
structural damage at the administrative courthouse in Dusseldorf,
35 miles north of Bonn, said police spokesman Heinz Reiner. The
bomb was on the top floor, he said.
   Another bomb exploded outside the courthouse in Muenster, 60
miles away, blowing a hole in the wall and shattering windows, a
police officer said.
   The explosions occurred within an hour of each other,
authorities said.
   The motive for the bombings was unknown, police said. They also
said they were unsure whether the attacks were related.

<TEXT>
   Wives of crew members of the USS White Plains
gathered at a naval station chapel Tuesday night to await word of
their husbands.
   Six men were killed and five injured when fire broke out aboard
the Navy supply ship in the South China Sea. The 581-foot vessel,
with a crew of 403 enlisted men and 25 officers, has been based on
this Pacific island since 1984.
   Some of the wives were inside the chapel, quietly making
telephone calls. Some sat in the ``crying rooms,'' where babies can
be taken during church services. Others waited outside in their
cars.
   The ship's ombudsman, the liaison between the ship and the wives
on shore, was inside the chapel office, meeting with wives and the
chapel staff.
   Those approaching the chapel who were not wives of White Plains
crewmen were turned away.
   A few of the wives arrived at Guam International Airport after a
weekend visit with their husbands in Hong Kong, where the ship had
made a port call. They did not know about the incident when their
plane landed.
   The White Plains was due to return to Guam this month from a
cruise that began Dec. 27 and also took it to Singapore and
Australia. The White Plains is one of four ships based on Guam.
   Eighty of the White Plains crewmen are married with families
living on Guam, Lt. Robert Crossan, the ship's chaplain, said in
December.
   Tuesday's fire comes three weeks after an explosion in a gun
turret on the battleship USS Iowa killed 47 sailors during an
exercise near Puerto Rico.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lack of rainfall continued to hurt crops in
major areas of the Great Plains while too much rain slowed spring
planting in the eastern Corn Belt and the Southeast, a government
report said Tuesday.
   Winter wheat was in mostly fair-to-poor condition nationally
during the week of May 1-7, although the Great Plains crop was
rated below that. In the Pacific Northwest, Corn Belt and
Southeast, winter wheat was said to be in ``mostly good to fair''
shape.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said 89 percent of the
winter wheat crop in Kansas was in very poor or poor condition
``and continued to deteriorate due to lack of moisture'' during the
week.
   Harvesting of the 1989 winter wheat crop has begun in southern
Texas and will gradually move north. The Agriculture Department
will issue its first official estimate of this year's production on
Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the report by the facility, which is operated jointly
by USDA and the Commerce Department, said corn planting nationally
was about 43 percent completed, eight percentage points behind
normal for this time.
   ``Lack of moisture has slowed germination and emergency (of
corn) in Kansas,'' the report said. ``Rain continued to slow
planting in the eastern Corn Belt and the Southeast.''
   Corn planting was 42 percentage points behind in Ohio and 25
points behind in Indiana, the report said. Planting trailed the
usual pace by 34 percentage points in North Carolina.
   Only about 5 percent of the soybean crop had been planted, four
percentage points behind the normal pace, although planting was
under way in all major soybean states except Minnesota and North
Carolina.

<HEAD>Walesa Urges Workers to Support Upcoming Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa went to a steel mill where his
agreements with communist authorities were criticized and told 400
workers in a packed hall Tuesday: ``We have a chance to make the
Poland of our dreams.''
   The Solidarity leader said unity is needed if opposition
candidates are to win National Assembly seats in next month's
elections, which will be partially free.
   Also on Wednesday, talks to settle a 5-day-old strike at four
copper mines broke down and miners accused management of backing
down from pay promises, the Solidarity Information Service reported.
   Barbara Hrybacz, a Solidarity spokeswoman, said the strike had
appeared near an end Tuesday morning when a management offer of a
50 percent increase after 11 hours of talks satisfied strikers'
original demands.
   Government ministers told the miners later that authorities
could not favor one sector by granting their pay demands and
appealed for an end to the strike, state TV reported.
   Workers in the hall at the Huta Warszawa steel plant grilled
Walesa for over an hour about the elections, union policy and the
copper strikes.
   A Solidarity splinter group led Seweryn Jaworski of Huta
Warszawa has urged a boycott of the elections on grounds they are
not completely free.
   On Tuesday, however, Jaworski sat on the speaker's platform with
Walesa, advisers Jacek Kuron and Bronislaw Geremek, and Zbigniew
Bujak, Solidarity leader of the Warsaw region.
   ``We have a chance to make the Poland of our dreams,'' Walesa
declared. ``Today, we have all the opportunities. There is a
terrible struggle ahead of us, so we have to get to work.''
   ``I would like to hear the problems that hurt you. ... I came
here to be wiser. I would like to be directed by you,'' he said in
brief introductory remarks.
   The first questioner shouted at Walesa: ``How can you be sure
that we will have completely free elections in four years?''
   He replied: ``We can't be sure, where is our certainty? It is
written at the round table. My question is whether we will take
advantage of it. Our purpose is to get full democratic elections in
the next term.''
   His reference was to the ``round table'' agreements concluded
with the government April 5 that legalized Solidarity after a
seven-yar ban and provide for the elections in June.
   Under the agreement, the opposition can run candidates for 161
of the 460 seats in the Sejm, the current unicameral parliament,
and for all 100 seats in a 100-member Senate in the new National
Assembly. The next elections in four years time are to be fully
democratic.
   Walesa and his advisers have said they support the elections as
an evolutionary way to democracy that can help end the Communist
Party's monopoly on political and economic power.
   ``Today we are together,'' he said Tuesday. ``The elections will
decide who is the appropriate person and who is not.''
   Workers at the meeting criticized Walesa for not calling a
Solidarity congress for guidance in negotiations with the
government, and he responded: ``There was no time for democracy. I
went there to get Solidarity.''
   When asked about the copper strikes, he repeated his argument
that everyonw in Poland has a reason to strike for more money but
the most important issue for Solidarity is organization.
   ``We have to solve the most significant things,'' he said.
``There is a dangerous struggle. We have an opportunity for
civilized, organized actions. Let's get ourselves organized.''
   Stability is vital if Poland is to receive Western economic aid,
he said.
   Walesa works as a shipyard electrician in Gdansk and led the
strike that gave birth to Solidarity in 1980 as the first
independent union in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity was outlawed in
1982, under martial law, and Walesa won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1983.
   Industry Minister Mieczyslaw Wilczek and Jozef Oleksy, minister
for trade unions, made the government appeal for an end to the mine
strike at a meeting with representatives of Solidarity and official
unions, state TV reported.
   The four mines, employing about 20,000 miners, are near Lubin in
southwestern Poland and produce most of the natin's copper. The
strike committee said 15,000 miners were suporting the labor action.
   Oficial media said the strike had cut production by about
100,000 tons daily and the daily financial loss was about $2.8
million.

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic archbishop of
Asuncion has urged Paraguayans to plant flowering trees beside the
graves of torture victims from the deposed regime of Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner.
   On Monday night, Archbishop Ismael Rolon stood before a
coffin-shaped box covered with a maroon shroud at Mass dedicated to
torture victims. Beside him was a small tree decorated with
multicolored tags bearing the names of 68 people believed to have
been killed by the deposed regime.
   ``Next to every one of the tombs discovered we must plant a ...
tree, which on flowering every year will renew our hopes and
refresh our spirit,'' Rolon told about 700 worshipers at the
National Cathedral.
   ``We must never again remain quiet,'' he said. ``Silence
provoked by fear helped these crimes to take place and granted
immunity.''
   Stroessner was ousted three months ago in a coup by Gen. Andres
Rodriguez, who was elected president May 1 by an overwhelming
margin. Rodriguez pledged to respect human rights and punish those
responsible for past abuses.
   In past weeks, a skull and bone shards of three alleged victims
of the past regime were unearthed in a rural area.
   Excavations at another site believed to be a mass grave for
peasants was suspended after water seeped into the cavity and
prevented further digging.
   Ignacio Duarte, a former political prisoner, has said there are
at least six graves in the garden of a police barracks on the
outskirts of Asuncion. But he has been prevented by police from
entering the barracks to point out the site.

   Shells hit hospitals, apartments, post
offices and communications facilities Tuesday in one of the most
destructive artillery duels of the 14-year-old civil war, killing
11 people and wounding 50.
   The savage bombardment by Syrian gunners and Christian army
units blanketed the Moslem and Christian sectors of Beirut, nearby
hills and a stretch of Christian coast north of the city.
   By police count, 327 people have been killed and 1,234 wounded
since March 8, when fighting began between the 20,000 Christian
soldiers commanded by Gen. Michel Aoun and a Moslem alliance of
Syrian troops and Druse militiamen. Most of the casualties have
been civilians.
   Sheik Sabah Ahmed, foreign minister of Kuwait and head of an
Arab League mediation panel, said plans to send Arab military
observers to Beirut had been suspended until another cease-fire
could be arranged. One called by the league April 28 was broken by
the latest battle.
   Beirut residents took refuge in underground shelters for a
fourth day. Syrian troops in Moslem west Beirut and on nearby
slopes blsted the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east
of the city, using multibarreled rocket launchers that fire up to
40 projectiles a minute.
   Aoun's Christian units pummeled the Moslem sector of Beirut and
Druse-held villages in the central mountains with howitzer and
mortar fire.
   A police spokesman said the dead included two men killed by
shells that hit Barbir Hospital, one of four major medical centers
in west Beirut.
   At least 12 howitzer and mortar rounds hit Barbir overnight,
said the spokesman, who added that Mohammed Mosallem, an
administrator, was killed ``while supervising the patients'
evacuation to the underground shelter.''
   Bilal Daher, a 25-year-old journalist, was killed while trying
to help evacuate his elder brother, Ouday, who had fractured his
hip in an auto accident. Free-lance cameraman Mehdi Mehdi was
wounded in the leg by a sniper while trying to photograph damage at
the hospital.
   Reporters saw cleaners sweeping broken glass and debris out of
Barbir during a morning lull in the shelling.
   Several shells hit St. Louis hospital in the Christian port of
Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut, but the staff and patients had
been evacuated and no casualties were reported.
   Police said 31,000 shells and rockets had fallen on Beirut since
the latest battle began Saturday evening. U.N. sources and Lebanese
economic experts estimated the damage since March 8 at more than
$300 million.
   Police said shells and rockets struck many apartment buildings,
starting fires, post offices were hit and damage to communications
facilities knocked out local and overseas telephone service.
   To help fill the gap, the leftist Voice of the People radio
broadcast messages from people in Beirut to relatives elsewhere in
Lebanon.
   Radio reports said Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, who had
planned to visit Syria and Lebanon in an attempt to revive the
collapsed truce, was stranded in Rome by a strike of airport
workers.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League and has become the country's main
power broker during the long civil war.
   Salim Hoss, who leads the Moslem cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, and Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini met in Damascus
with Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam of Syria and Farouk Sharaa,
the foreign minister. Gen. Aoun heads the competing Christian
government.
   Ibrahimi is an Algerian and represents Chedli Klibi, the Arab
League secretary-general.
   In Kuwait, Sheik Sabah said: ``It has become difficult in light
of the recent developments to send the Arab observer force to
Lebanon to expose their lives to danger either by assassination or
killing as a result of the indiscriminate shelling.''
   Warring factions had agreed to the Arab League truce, but Syria
and its allies continued shelling the coastal strip, claiming three
Iraqi ships in the Mediterranean intended to deliver weapons to the
Christians.
   Aoun held fire until Saturday, then ordered his men to retaliate.

<TEXT>
   The environmental group Greenpeace accused the
Agriculture Department on Tuesday of failing to ensure that milk
provided in its school lunch program is free of the cancer-causing
chemical dioxin.
   The group has asked for a meeting as soon as possible with
officials of the department's food and nutrition service, which
turned down an earlier Greenpeace petition to require that milk
cartons used in the school lunch programs be made of material that
won't put dioxin in the milk.
   Gene Vincent, an Agriculture Department spokesman, said
officials scheduled a department meeting on the subject later in
the day.
   Greenpeace contends a Canadian government study shows paper milk
cartons made of paper bleached with chlorine can contain trace
amounts of dioxin, the most powerful cause of cancer ever tested in
laboratory animals.
   ``They have basically disparaged scientific findings,'' Janet
Hieber of Greenpeace told a news conference. She signed the group's
letter to Geroge A. Braley, deputy administrator for Special
Nutrition Programs, asking for a meeting.
   ``Newly available scientific information shows that milk
packaged in chlorine-bleached cartons poses a clear health threat
to children because these bleached cartons are contaminated with
dioxin that migrates into the children's milk,'' she wrote.
   On Feb. 13, Greenpeace petitioned the department to start a
formal rule-making proceeding to forbid bleached cartons for the
nearly 5 billion half-points of milk that USDA pays for each year
under five programs. It also asked temporary regulations to require
milk be provided in unbleached cartons, returnable glass bottles or
the like.
   In response, Braley said further study of the Canadian tests is
necessary and studies are being conducted by both the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration.
   Braley said that to take Greenpeace's action without further
studies ``would be extremely disruptive'' and alternative half-pint
containers for milk in glass or containers bleached without using
chlorine were not available.
   Ms. Hieber was asked how much milk a child would have to drink
from the current packaging to be harmed.
   ``From what we have seen in animal testing, even drinking a
carton a day is unhealthy,'' she said.
   ``We have not found any amount that is not toxic. Most of the
effects are latent ... you won't see the effects for 10 to 20
years, maybe 30 years.''
   She said alternative bleaching methods are available that won't
leach dioxin into milk.
   Asked what parents might do, she replied ``write to legislators,
the Secretary of Agriculture. In essence, you have no choice as
parents. I think parents should definitely be talking to their
school boards about this.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee
accused ousted leader Janos Kadar of making wrong decisions that
hampered the nation's political and economic progress, official
media reported Tuesday.
   The official MTI news agency on Tuesday released the message
sent to Kadar by the Central Committee, which stripped him of his
last official posts on Monday.
   The message said history would be the best judge of Kadar's 32
years as party leader.
   Kadar, 76, was removed as Hungarian leader last year and
replaced by Karoly Grosz, who has allowed more personal freedoms
and political reforms.
   ``Today we cannot undertake to assess your 50-year historic
career, which is inseparably linked with the advancement _ not free
of contradictions _ of the Hungarian nation,'' MTI quoted the
message to Kadar as saying.
   ``In the final anaysis, only posterity can complete a balance
sheet of an era which is linked to the name of Janos Kadar.''
   Informing Kadar that he was being removed from the powerful
Central Committee and the honorary post of party president, the
party leadership said ``the objective difficulties of the past 15
years and our economic and political woes have been aggravated by
erroneous decisions, which were taken on more than one occasion.''
   In a clear break with the former leader, the Central Committee
stated: ``We cannot underestimate our (achievements) but we cannot
keep silent about our errors, either.''
   Foreign Minister-designate Gyula Horn also criticized Kadar, who
became party leader as Soviet troops and tanks crushed an
anti-Soviet revolt in 1956.
   ``We must not gloss over the fact that grave errors were also
committed during that period, the impact of which are felt today,''
Horn said on state-run TV. ``The so-called years of stagnation are
also linked to Kadar's name.''
   Kadar has come under increasing criticism in official media for
his role in postwar purges and allegedly in the arrest and
execution in 1958 of revolutionary premier Imre Nagy and several of
his associates.
   Kadar has also been indirectly blamed for the downward slide in
recent years of the national economy, once a model of prosperity in
the socialist world.
   Hungary is saddled with a $17 billion foreign debt, inflation
expected to top 16 percent this year and sharply declining living
standards.
   A party official who addressed a news conference said Kadar was
sent into retirement for health reasons.
   Party secretary Gyoergy Fejti told reporters, ``The Central
Committee noted with sadness that the health of chairman Kadar does
not allow him to fulfill his functions and, therefore, decided to
release him.''
   Fejti said the Central Committee letter expressed ``respect and
esteem'' for Kadar's contributions.
   ``We are sure that both history and public opinion will see this
period as a progressive one despite the shortcomings,'' said Fejti.
   He would not divulge details about Kadar's health.
   Budapest's Kossuth radio reported in a noon broadcast that Kadar
spoke incoherently during the last Central Committee meeting two
weeks ago.
   Fejti also discussed the ruling party's efforts to set up a
national round table to negotiate with newly formed opposition
groups on the transition to a multiparty system and methods of
reversing the economic crisis.

<TEXT>
   President Bush remains committed to convening
an international environmental conference, his spokesman said
Tuesday, while administration officials disagree on whether to hold
a meeting geared toward a treaty on global warming.
   Bush discussed his desire for a global environmental conference,
which would focus on global warming and other issues, during a
meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, said White House
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   That conference would be different than a so-called framework
convention that some in the administration are pushing as a way to
get an accord in the works. The accord would seek agreement by
nations on curbing practices leading to the world's climactic
warming trend.
   The environmental conference Bush wants would be more general
and could focus on discussing various issues, said Nancy Maloley,
associate director of the Office of Policy Development. She said
the global warming framework convention has not been ruled out.
   However, some presidential advisers, including Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly, wanted the United
States to make a formal diplomatic overture this week at an
internatinal meeting in Geneva to get the ball rolling on a global
warming convention.
   The idea was dropped by the White House as being premature
because the administration has not yet decided its policy on global
warming, in which emissions from burning of fossil fuels is said to
be increasing the world's temperature.
   Developing that position involves taking into account the impact
on many sectors of the country, including the agricultural and oil
industries, and the cost to the government of measures to deal with
the problems.
   Fitzwater said Bush, who promised during his presidential
campaign to convene an environmental conference, does not have a
time for that conference.
   ``His environmental advisers are currently looking at various
formulations for such a meeting and he will discuss it with allied
leaders later in the year,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush ``said the conference would be at the expert level, and
would be designed to utilize the considerable environmental talent
in the United States,'' Fitzwater.
   Officials say the government is not ready to begin moving toward
a controversial convention on global warming because it would
involve so many segments of the administration, in addition to the
scientific advisers.
   Earlier this week, NASA scientist James E. Hansen complained
that the Office of Management and Budget had altered his
conclusions on global warming to soften his predictions of dire
consequences from the trend. The White House said the changes were
to reflect that not all scientists and analysts within the
administration agree that the results will be so dramatic.

   A man who police said posed as an astronaut,
fooling the mayor of Dublin, Ireland, and even his wife, pleaded
guilty to using a credit card fraudulently to pay for a $6,000
charter flight.
   Robert Hunt, 27, was released from jail and put on a year's
probation after his plea Monday. He had already served three months
and 12 days in jail following his arrest.
   Boston Municipal Court Judge Herbert Hershfang ordered Hunt to
undergo psychiatric treatment and to repay Eastern Air Charter of
Norwood for the airplane rental.
   Hunt was accused of posing in a variety of roles over several
years, including Marine captain, astronaut and jet pilot. He
scorched some kitchen tiles and told his wife, whom he married last
year, that they were from the space shuttle Challenger, police said.
   He also visited the lord mayor of Dublin while on a trip to
Ireland, posing as an astronaut, and, closer to home, gave a
well-received speech about his space experiences to an aviation
club in Bedford.
   But after he was arrested Jan. 28, police said Hunt had swindled
his unsuspecting new wife of up to $50,000 on her company-issued
credit card, including the cost of the charter flight to Montreal.
He told her that flight was free because of his astronaut
experience.
   Recalling the day he was unmasked, his wife, Ann Sweeney, said:
``I was shocked. It was almost like watching someone die. He just
dissolved, disappeared.''
   He was charged with using an American Express credit card issued
by Polaroid Corp. to Ms. Sweeney to rent a jet and flight crew to
fly him and her to Montreal. American Express refused to pay for
the flight because Hunt, not his wife, had signed to rent the plane.

   Anti-communist rebels claimed
responsibility Tuesday for a bomb in the Angolan capital of Luanda
that destroyed the offices of the Texaco oil company and two other
foreign firms, injuring two people.
   The 6.6-pound bomb exploded Monday night and destroyed the
Texaco office, as well as those of Japanese multinational Sumitomo
Corp. and France's Petromar.
   ``Angola is in a state of war,'' said Alcides Sakala, a
spokesman for the rebels known as UNITA, or the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola. ``If these companies weren't
operating out of Angola, and supporting the Luanda regime, they
wouldn't be targets.''
   A child in an apartment above the offices was hurt and a
Sumitomo director suffered minor head injuries in the blast, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
   Sakala said the attack was a response to provocation by forces
of Luanda's communist government.
   The blast, the fourth in Luanda since last year, wrecked cars
parked on the oceanside boulevard and shattered windows at the
nearby Hotel Presidente and the Congolese Embassy, Lusa said.
   The rebels have been fighting the government since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

   The 28-year-old woman who was raped and beaten

   Dr. Robert Kurtz of Metropolitan Hospital said the woman ``shows

it by its function but not its name, he said.
   Her maximum temperature was 99.7 degrees, he said, ``which
implies continued healing of her pneumonia.'' The woman has battled
pneumonia and high fever in the past 10 days.
   The woman, an investment banker, was attacked by a gang of

Six teen-agers have been indicted.

<HEAD>North Korea Demands U.S. Removes Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea called Tuesday for the
United States to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula,
saying they pose a threat of nuclear war.
   The United States dismissed the call as ``repetitious
propaganda.''
   Maj. Gen. Choe Ui Ung, a North Korean spokesman, urged the
creation of a nuclear-free zone at a meeting of the Military
Armistice Commission overseeing the cease-fire that ended the
bitter 1950-53 Korean War.
   ``In light of the international trend to remove the danger of
nuclear war, we have presented the issue of removing the nuclear
weapons at this meeting,'' he said.
   U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Larry G. Vogt welcomed North Korea's call
for the meeting, but said the nuclear charges were ``repetitious
propaganda'' to weaken South Korea and its allies. He was speaking
for the 16 nations that aided Seoul in the Korean War.
   Vogt did not respond directly to Choe's charges that the United
States is storing nuclear weapons in South Korea as part of war
preparations.
   Instead, the American suggested the commission discuss steps to
ease tension, such as the restoration of joint observer teams to
investigate alleged armistice violations, and the return of remains
of soldiers killed in the war.
   The creation of a nuclear-free zone was a ``political'' issue
out of the purview of the command, Vogt said.
   The United States declines to confirm or deny if it has nuclear
weapons in South Korea. Past reports indicate U.S. forces are
equipped with some tactical nuclear weapons.
   Choe said U.S. nuclear arms in South Korea include artillery
shells, warheads for missiles, mines, bombs and said two nuclear
airfields are under construction.
   ``It is not only a hypocrisy, but also a deception of the public
opinion that you talk about the nuclear disarmament while keeping
nuclear weapons in South Korea, the most dangerous hotbed of
nuclear war in the world,'' he said.
   South Korean officials said the meeting marked the first time in
recent memory that the Pyongyang government offered an agenda in
advance. They said it also was the first time North Korea focused
on one topic.
   North Korea, which invaded South Korea in 1950, repeatedly uses
the commission to call for the removal of U.S. forces from the
peninsula. South Korea says the 42,000 U.S. troops are vital to
prevent another communist attack.

<HEAD>Study: Greater Demand Triggered Nurse Shortage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greater demand, not job burnout, is the major
cause of the nationwide nursing shortage, according to a two-year
study released Tuesday.
   ``Despite widespread beliefs to the contrary, it is simply not
true that large numbers of nurses are being driven out of nursing
by their working conditions, by a lack of respect from doctors, or
indeed by anything else,'' said the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation
whose goal is improving health care.
   The study said only 6 percent of the people holding nursing
licenses are working outside the profession.
   Instead, ``a key explanation for the shortage is the steady
growth in demand for nurses by hospitals, which employ about
two-thirds of all working nurses.''
   Demand has jumped because doctors now ``aggressively treat or
operate upon very ill patients whom a few years ago they would not
have subjected to such extensive intervention,'' it said.
   Forty percent of all hospital nurses work in intensive care
units, which need four to six times more nurses per bed than other
medical and surgical units.
   The number of working nurses jumped from 750,000 in 1970 to 1.62
million in 1988. Still, an average of 15.4 percent of all budgeted
nursing positions in hospitals are now vacant.
   ``Medicine today is not what medicine was 20 years ago _ that's
the crucial point,'' said Eli Ginzberg, a Columbia University
economics professor and health policy specialist who participated
in the study.
   While hospitals historically have shown a ``reluctance to
innovate,'' these surveyors ``sensed people believing that business
as usual wasn't going to do it any more,'' said Marc Roberts, a
professor at the Harvard School of Public Health.
   The survey questioned 15,000 nurses and 400 hospitals in New
York, Boston, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles.
Entry-level nurse salaries ranged from $20,000 to $28,000 and
peaked between $30,000 and $40,000.
   Today's hospital nurses primarily are married women in their 30s
and 40s, with school-aged children.
   Asked what were very important among their concerns, 51 percent
of full-time nurses listed scheduling, 48 percent salary and 40
percent benefits.
   Nursing school enrollments have declined, partly due to a
shrinking work-age force and partly due to increased career options
for women. While some men are being recruited, 97 percent of all
nurses still are women.
   The study said state governments should help nursing schools
recruit recent college graduates, displaced workers, low-income
people and members of minority groups. Scholarships, loans and
work-study programs also were recommended.

<HEAD>People Around the World Fear Pollution, Say It's Getting Worse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. survey says people around the world, no
matter their economic standing or education, are acutely worried
about environmental problems and believe pollution will get worse
before it gets better.
   The survey was conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for the
United Nations Environment Program, the organization's lead agency
for dealing with environmental matters. It was released Tuesday in
Washington and in Nairobi, Kenya where the agency has its
headquarters.
   At a news conference, Louis Harris said the findings are
``nothing less than an alarm about the state of the environment''
and indicate environmental concerns will play an increasingly
important political role in the next decade.
   ``I think in the next five years governments will topple because
of the environmental issues,'' he said.
   According to the polls, more than 75 percent of the people in
each of the countries surveyed believed that stronger government
action was needed to protect against pollution. Governments
generally were given poor to mediocre grades on dealing with
environmental matters.
   In all but one of the countries _ Saudi Arabia _ most people
rated their environment as only fair or poor and in all of the
countries surveyed a majority said they would be willing to pay
higher taxes if they knew the money would be spent on environmental
protection.
   The survey in 14 countries was conducted last year and a shorter
version was conducted in the United States in April. Between 400
and 1,253 people were interviewed in each of the nations on
subjects ranging from their view of the environment to whether they
thought the government was doing enough to protect it.
   The foreign countries were Argentina, China, Hungary, India,
Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Saudi Arabia,
Senegal, West Germany, and Zimbabwe.
   Large majorities in each of the countries said they perceive a
direct link between environmental quality and public health.
   The surveys revealed broad concern about the quality of drinking
water, chemical pollution of the air as well as lakes and rivers,
loss of agricultural lands and forests, and disposal of toxic
wastes.
   ``Only tiny minorities in any nation surveyed believed their
environmental laws were too strict,'' said the United Nations
agency.
   In the United States, 64 percent of those interviewed gave the
environment a fair or poor rating. That was mild, however, compared
to the responses to a similar question posed in seven other
countries. More than 80 percent of the respondents in Hungary,
Senegal, Mexico, China, West Germany, India and Japan gave a
similar assessment.
   Water and air pollution most often were cited as posing the most
concern.
   People in countries that are still moving toward
industrialization often expressed the greatest concern about air
pollution, while only 23 percent of the Japanese surveyed held such
concerns despite that nation's enormous industrial concentration,
the survey said.
   In all of the countries there was fear that environmental
problems will likely become worse.
   Even in Saudi Arabia, the only country where today's environment
received a positive mark, 61 percent of those surveyed said the
environment will get worse. Nine out of 10 people in Argentina said
the environment will deteriorate, the most pessimistic view in all
of the nations in the survey.

<HEAD>House Seeks Extra Anti-Drug Financing in Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House put itself on record on Tuesday as
favoring added muscle for the nation's anti-drug efforts and
opposing an increase in the tax on gasoline to help cut the federal
deficit.
   Lawmakers voted 397-10 to call on House-Senate negotiators to
alter the proposed fiscal 1990 budget by transfering $100 million
from the account that pays for congressional mailings to law
enforcement initiatives.
   Bargaining between the two chambers over a $1.2 trillion
spending plan for next year is set to begin Wednesday.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House
Budget Committee, proposed the non-binding measure, saying that
fears that more money needed to be diverted to anti-drug programs
``seemed to plague'' many lawmakers.
   The section of the budget containing money for law enforcement,
and the portion covering general government expenses such as
congressional mailings, each contain about $10 billion for next
year.
   The House-passed measure also included language urging the
chamber's negotiators to oppose a boost in the 9.1-cent-per-gallon
federal tax on gasoline.
   On a voice vote, the Senate put itself on record last week as
being against such an increase. Administration officials have
reportedly considered consenting to such an increase for fiscal
1991, which begins Oct. 1, 1990, in exchange for a cut in the
capital gains tax.
   House and Senate budget writers are hoping their efforts to
agree to a compromise budget will last only a few days. The two
spending plans differ little, mainly because of a pact between
congressional leaders and the Bush administration that set overall
spending and taxing figures and laid out $28 billion in claimed
deficit reduction.
   On another front, leaders of the House Appropriations Committee
are still trying to rework the $4.7 billion domestic spending bill
for this year that the House defeated two weeks ago.
   Efforts to pare the bill down in size have run into objections
from Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, chairman of the Appropriations
justice subcommittee. He has continued to insist that much of the
$750 million for anti-drug initiatives in the original measure
should remain intact.
   Republicans and some Democrats have said the measure is too
expensive. The portion of the bill that members say is most
urgently needed is $340 million for veterans' health programs, an
account that could run out of money by Memorial Day.

<TEXT>
   The lesson of the runaway Exxon Valdez oil spill
is that getting people and equipment to the scene quickly is
crucial, an Alaska environmental official told colleagues from the
Pacific Northwest on Tuesday.
   ``One thing we learned, if the right equipment isn't brought to
bear quickly to contain the pill, you're going to be chasing it
forever,'' said Jeff Mach, a cleanup coordinator with Alaska's
Environmental Conservation Department.
   Mach addressed the first meeting of the Oil Spill Task Force
since the Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 in Alaska's Prince
William Sound, spilling 10.1 million gallons of crude and fouling
more than 600 miles of wildlife-rich coast.
   Washington and British Columbia created the task force after a
barge spilled 270,000 gallons of fuel oil in the Pacific in
December, fouling the coast. Oregon and Alaska were invited to join
after the Exxon accident.
   Members of the group Tuesday set about the task of working more
closely to prevent spills and clean them up more effectively. They
outlined four areas:
   _Taking stock of what cleanup equipment is available and
developing a plan for dispatching it to the site of a spill.
   _Sharing information on procedures, laws and mechanisms to
recover costs from polluters.
   _Sharing technology.
   _Improving spill prevention, the adequacy of Coast Guard radar
coverage of shipping lanes, and guidelines for crew training.
   ``This is a case of forgetting about jurisdiction and dealing
with who's got what kind of capabilities. British Columbia's
resources are at risk and we'd like to have a look-see at how well
prepared everybody is,'' said Rick Wilson of the province's
Ministry of Environment.
   Christine Gregoire, head of Washington's Department of Ecology,
said the time was right for such an effort.
   ``The congressional delegation is interested, the Legislature is
interested and has oil-spill bills to deal with _ there's even a
citizens initiative in the works,'' she said.
   Gregoire said a variety of changes are needed to enhance the
safety of shipping products like oil. Foremost was increasing the
liability of shippers, she said.
   One of the immediate concerns of the task force is Exxon's plan
to move the crippled tanker to Portland, Ore., for repairs
   Richard Dalon, deputy minister of British Columbia's Ministry of
Environment, said a consultant for the province concluded the
tanker was structurally sound to make the trip if seas are
relatively calm. However, the consultant, Olaf Hatlen, reported
holes as large as 20 feet across in the bottom of the hull and a
crack that extends nearly halfway across the hull.

   House Speaker Jim Wright on Tuesday accused
the ethics committee's special outside counsel of distorting
testimony in an effort to implicate him in House rules violations,
but committee members dismissed the charge as a defense gambit.
   At the same time, the ethics panel faced a possible expansion of
its investigation of the speaker, requesting court records from a
Texas fraud trial where Wright's name has surfaced and scheduling a
meeting for Wednesday to decide whether to pursue a gas drilling
venture that proved lucrative to Wright.
   Wright's new eight-member legal defense team filed a series of
motions with the ethic committee, asking for access to committee
documents and witnesses and seeking to bar private contact between
the panel and its outside counsel, Chicago lawyer Richard J. Phelan.
   Other motions were being prepared asking that the most serious
charges against Wright be dismissed because they are based on
faulty reading of House rules.
   ``I think Mr. Wright will be totally cleared in any fair trial
before his peers,'' said Stephen D. Susman, a Houston lawyer
brought in to bolster the speaker's defense team.
   In a blunt attack on Phelan, Wright said his attorneys ``have
been profoundly shocked by the lack of professionalism and
prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy contained in the Phelan
report'' and called the committee's investigation ``one-sided.''
   He also said the 12 ethics committee members attended few
interviews of witnesses. ``It has rendered them totally dependent
on Mr. Phelan's interpretation and his summary of the
investigation,'' Wright said.
   And on one issue _ whether his wife, Betty, earned the
$18,000-a-year salary she was paid by Fort Worth developer George
Mallick from 1979 through 1984 _ Phelan ignored testimony of
another Mallick employee and concluded Mrs. Wright worked only 12
days in four years, Wright said.
   ``That's a lie, a falsehood, a distortion and a
misrepresentation of the testimony that was given,'' he charged.
   But committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., and other panel
members said Wright was wrong in contending Phelan had misled the
committee.
   ``I'm very proud of the way they (the panel) have conducted
themselves and thoroughly digested everything made available to
them,'' Dixon said.
   Asked whether he was disturbed by Wright's strategy of attacking
Phelan, Dixon said he was not, but added: ``I'm glad you recognize
that that is the strategy.''
   Panel member Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said he had personally
sat in on more than 50 hours of depositions and said most committee
members had read all or nearly of the interview transcripts
compiled during the investigation.
   ``To charge that Mr. Phelan has distorted this is to assume the
committee hasn't done its homework,'' Craig said. ``I think the
committee has done its homework very well.''
   The panel scheduled a meeting for Wednesday to discuss whether
to pursue a flurry of additional charges surrounding Wright,
including whether the speaker improperly benefited last year from a
gas-drilling venture in Sabine Lake that yielded him a quick
$170,000 in profits.
   A source familiar with the investigation, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, also said the committee has asked for transcripts and
exhibits from a criminal fraud trial in Dallas in which Wright's
name showed up in the corner of a $1,000 check given as a
contribution in 1985 to a political action committee by the wife of
a savings and loan executive.
   Although Wright is not directly involved in the trial, it raises
again the issue of whether he tried to exert improper influence on
behalf of the S&amp;L industry. The ethics committee already has looked
at similar questions but did not bring charges.
   ``We just can't get our platter cleared off before more is piled
onto it,'' said Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the panel's senior
Republican.
   Wright's defense team, meanwhile, was seeking to reduce the 69
formal counts of alleged rules violations before the speaker goes
to a trial-like disciplinary hearing before the ethics panel,
probably next month.
   Wright is charged with evading House limits on outside earned
income through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and with improperly
accepting some $145,000 in gifts from Mallick, who has been deemed
by the committee as having a direct interest in legislation before
Congress.
   But Wright's attorneys argued that a strict reading of the rules
permits unlimited book royalties to be collected by a House member.
They also sought to make the case that Mallick had no direct
interest in legislation as defined by the rules, and that therefore
any ``gifts'' from him to the Wrights would be acceptable.
   They contended Phelan misread the history behind the rules and
brought charges when none were warranted. Phelan's charges amount
to a rewriting of the rules, the defense lawyers said.
   Tuesday's motions included an effort to formally isolate Phelan
from the ethics panel by arguing he now takes on the role of
prosecutor and the committee should therefore limit its private
contact with him to maintain objectivity.
   The motions all must be ruled on by the ethics committee.

<HEAD>Group Says Nation Facing Loss of Housing Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Housing Conference said Tuesday
that the nation faces the loss of hundreds of thousands of
federally assisted housing units and urged a $10 billion-a-year
program to preserve and produce housing for low- and
moderate-income families.
   The conference, a non-profit organization of civic leaders and
leaders of the housing industry, said the inventory of federally
assisted housing units is declining because of several factors and
that no federal program is in place to replace lost housing.
   John Simon, president of the group, said at a news conference
that the nation faces the ``imminent and long-term loss of between
200,000 and 1.2 million units'' of subsidized housing.
   In calling for new federal spending, he said Congress and the
administration have shown a willingness to spend massive amounts to
bail out the savings and loan industry and provide agricultural
subsidies, and should do the same for affordable housing.
   ``We think money can also be found and must be found to house
our people,'' he said.
   If the loss in housing occurs, Simon said there would be
``massive displacement of poor and low-income tenants, and the
working poor, and a dramatic increase in the number of homeless
families.''
   Simon and other conference leaders said the problem is being
created by the termination or expiration of federal subsidy
contracts for housing projects, the loss of assisted housing and
public housing due to deterioration and inadequate maintenance, and
the prepayment of mortgages on privately owned subsidized housing.
   The end of mortgages and subsidy contracts permit private owners
of federally assisted housing to convert the housing to market-rate
rental units or condominiums, he said.
   He said housing officials have stated such a wide estimate of
potential housing losses because they do not know how private
owners and developers will react when their subsidy contracts
expire.
   Simon said the organization was asking for $10 billion yearly
increases for several years in spending on housing programs.
   He said the money should be used to provide new incentives,
including tax benefits and subsidies, to induce owners to keep
projects in the assisted housing inventory. He said money should
also be spent to create new subsidized housing and to create a
trust fund to aid first-time home buyers.
   The National Housing Conference, which concluded a two-day
meeting, was created in 1931 and is the oldest national housing
organization.

<TEXT>
   The Labor Party, battling to broaden its appeal
after a decade in opposition, on Tuesday dumped its vote-losing
doctrine of unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   Urged on by party leader Neil Kinnock, Labor's National
Executive voted 17-8 for a new policy of multilateralism, under
which a Labor-led government would scrap Britain's independent
nuclear arsenal only in a negotiated arms control deal.
   A 16-9 vote defeated a motion by the hard-line left to set a
deadline for scrapping Britain's submarine-based nuclear missiles
unilaterally.
   The National Executive adopted an unopposed amendment whereby a
Labor government would negotiate nuclear disarmament with the
Soviet Union if U.S.-Soviet negotiations stalled.
   But the executive also adopted unopposed a resolution saying
nuclear weapons are ``not a deterrent and of no practical use.''
The governing Conservative Party contended this is tantamount to
saying a Labor government would never use nuclear arms.
   Labor left-wingers accused their party of betraying its
principles and vowed to fight to reverse the new policy at the
party's annual convention in October, which must approve the policy
changes.
   The shift is part of a wide-ranging policy review designed to
draw Labor back to the political center and kill the public
perception of a party in thrall to doctrinaire left-wingers.
   Arguing passionately against unilateralism, Kinnock told his
colleagues he had tried out the doctrine on U.S., French and even
Soviet leaders and won no understanding for it.
   ``Unilateralism is not even comprehended by those who share our
objectives in other countries,'' he said.
   ``They were totally uncomprehending that we should want to get
rid of a nuclear system without getting elimination of nuclear
weapons on other sides too _ without getting anything for it in
return,'' he said.
   The 47-year-old Welshman, once an ardent unilateralist,
reiterated a theme that has resonated throughout the two-day
National Executive meeting _ that only by breaking with the past
can Labor win power.
   ``Out of power, we do not have the opportunities of unilateral
or any other sort of disarmament,'' he said. ``We only have the
chance to talk about it. In power we can act and make dramatic
progress.''
   Unilateralism was adopted by Labor in 1981 and has been cited as
a key reason for Labor's two subsequent defeats by the
Conservatives under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who believes
nuclear deterrence alone can keep the world at peace.
   Answering questions in Parliament, Mrs. Thatcher said the new
policy was ``unilateralism in a different wrapping.''
   Her defense secretary, George Younger, said, ``To arm yourself
with a deterrent, which you then say you will not use, would be
about as effective as a feather duster.''
   Labor's foreign affairs chief, Gerald Kaufman, insisted the new
policy was in line with most of Britain's NATO partners.
   On Monday, the National Executive voted 23-4 to jettison
commitments to renationalize all state-owned industries sold to
private investors by the Thatcher government.
   On Tuesday it dealt the hard left more defeats. It threw out a
proposal to abolish the unelected House of Lords, voting instead to
establish an elected upper chamber. Calls to quit NATO and the
European Economic Community, and withdraw British troops from
Northern Ireland, all were heavily defeated.

<HEAD>State Officials Call For Bigger Role In Defense Waste Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States directly affected by the extensive soil
and groundwater pollution at federal nuclear weapons factories
should be given a bigger role in shaping a long-term cleanup plan,
state officials told Congress on Tuesday.
   Health and environmental regulators from Idaho, South Carolina,
Colorado and Washington state said the Energy Department, which
owns 16 major nuclear arms facilities in 12 states, must show a
clearer commitment to working with the states.
   ``We should have been involved six months ago'' in the Energy
Department's cleanup planning for the Savannah River nuclear
weapons site in South Carolina, said Lewis Shaw of the South
Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.
   Shaw said it was ``very difficult'' for his state to judge
whether the Energy Department's proposed spending for cleanup is
adequate, in part because no one yet knows the full extent of soil
and groundwater contamination at Savannah River. The site contains
three active nuclear reactors and several processing plants.
   ``There are almost certainly problems as yet undiscovered,''
Shaw told a special panel of House members from states that host,
or are adjacent, to the nuclear facilities. ``All of this suggests
that currently projected cleanup costs may be short of what will
actually be needed to properly restore the site in timely manner.''
   The Bush administration has proposed spending $400 million on
cleanup in the coming budget year.
   Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the Energy Department
facilities over the next three decades range from about $80 billion
to about $150 billion, although Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
said last week the cost could be far less.
   Watkins' top advisor on the nuclear cleanup problem, Leo Duffy,
told the House panel Watkins opposes a House bill that would create
a special commission to assess cleanup priorities and recommend
ways of carrying them out.
   ``We believe enactment of legislation at this time would prove
counterproductive and ... would complicate efforts now underway
within DOE to address environmental concerns,'' Duffy said.
   The bill passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee last
month.
   Last week, the governors of 10 states sent Watkins a letter
expressing ``concern, frustration and anger'' at the contamination
and years of environmental neglect at the nuclear facilities, which
have been operating since the early 1950s.
   The governors called for increased federal spending and a
clarification of the role of the states in ensuring environmental
compliance and overseeing the cleanup.
   The state officials testifying Tuesday complained that while the
Energy Department in recent years had begun paying closer attention
to the waste problem, it still was unclear whether the department
was committed to a long-term cleanup.
   ``We are in a period of uncertainty in Colorado as to how DOE
intends to assure that its annual budget requests are consistent
with the time frames for cleanup,'' said Tim Holeman, an advisor on
environmental issues to Colorado Gov. Roy Romer.
   Holeman said his state thinks more federal money should be made
available in the next budget year to assess and begin correcting
waste problems at the Rocky Flats nuclear facility near Denver,
which processes plutonium and makes weapons components.
   Terry Husseman, assistant director for waste management in the
Washington State Department of Ecology, told the panel his state
was satisfied with the $80 million that the Bush administration
planned to spend in the coming budget year to restore the
environment at the Hanford Reservation weapons plant near Richland,
Wash.
   ``We are, however, very concerned over future funding
prospects,'' Husseman said. He said Washington Gov. Booth Gardner
favors creating a federal trust fund to ensure that enough money is
available to finish the cleanup at Hanford and elsewhere.

   The Environmental Protection Agency ordered
tighter safeguards Tuesday to protect workers handling the
pesticide bromoxynil, saying that direct exposure could cause birth
defects.
   The EPA said that there are only ``negligible'' health risks to
consumers of food products on which the pesticide is used, but that
the risks are substantially greater to workers who come into direct
contact with the chemical.
   Bromoxynil, sold under the trade name Buctril, is used to
control broadleaf weeds in the growing of field corn, wheat,
onions, garlic, mint and flax.
   Under the EPA directive, mixers and other handlers of the
chemical must wear protective clothing, including
chemical-resistant shoes or boots. The manufacturer also must
provide protective labels warning that exposure to a worker during
pregnancy could cause birth defects.
   ``EPA believes that compliance with the new label directions and
restrictions will provide adequate protection from the risk of
birth defects,'' the agency said.

   President Bush will undergo a routine physical
examination at nearby Bethesda Naval Hospital on Wednesday, the
White House announced Tuesday.
   The examination, Bush's first as president, will include a chest
x-ray, hearing tests, an eye examination, an electrocardiagram,
allegery tests, a urinalysis and a dermatology examination, said a
White House statement.
   The statement, by presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
said that the examination would be under the direction of Bush's
personal physician, Dr. Burton Lee.
   Lee will conduct a ``complete history and personal
examination,'' the statement said. It said that Lee had taken
several blood samples earlier this week and that they ``will be
analyzed as part of the examination.''
   Bush, 64, was expected to fly by helicopter from the White House
to the hospital in Bethesda, Md., for the morning examination,
which is expected to take about four hours.
   ``Never felt better in my life,'' Bush said Tuesday when asked
about his health in an interview in the Oval Office with a group of
reporters.
   Although he suffered from ulcers 20 years ago, Bush has said he
is in excellent physical shape.
   He suffers from several physical ailments, however, including a
stronconductivity.
   The study said efforts by other countries to create alliances of
business, government and academia ``have the potential to weaken
the United States economically and militarily ... Observers have
suggested that the Sematech model _ federally sponsored
pre-competitive industry cooperation _ may be one answer to this
problem.''
   Sematech's aim is to achieve global leadership in semiconductor
manufacturing technology by 1993.
   The consortium was created because of fears a decline in the
U.S. semiconductor industry may undermine the competitive and
technological leadership of U.S. computer and communications
equipment makers. Also, there is the immediate issue of a growing
U.S. dependence on foreign sources for state-of-the-art weapons
components, the report said.
   It cautioned, however, that even if Sematech ``were a complete
success in its own terms, major issues now affecting the
competitiveness of U.S. chipmakers would remain _ limited marketing
opportunities and a range of tax, antitrust and trade policy
issues.''
   The study also said the United States would still trail the
Japanese and Europeans in developing technologies necessary for
leadership in semiconductors in the late 1990s, particularly in the
area of X-ray lithography.
   ``If the public investment in Sematech is not followed by an
increase in the competitive strength of U.S. chipmakers and their
suppliers, Sematech as a public policy will not have been
successful,'' the study said.
   Even as Sematech was gaining momentum in 1988, U.S. chipmakers
continued to lose ground commercially. U.S. semiconductor
manufacturers say their share of world market sales fall to 37
percent, 3 percentage points below 1987 levels, the study said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said Tuesday he never doubted Sematech would succeed.
   ``But keeping up with the technology and successfully competing
for worldwide chip sales are two different things,'' said the Texas
Democrat. ``It's not just the technology.''
   The study's author, Jeffrey L. Mayer, deputy director of the
office of Economic Policy at Commerce, said Sematech, now in its
second year, has ``done a very good job of getting to the starting
line.
   ``They are now in a position to begin achieving their explicit
R&amp;D objectives. It remains to be seen how well they do that, and
No. 2, what the long-range impact of that will be,'' Mayer said.
   The study, a report by the Advisory Council on Federal
Participation in Sematech, recommends the Pentagon spend $100
million on Sematech in fiscal 1990, which would be matched by the
member corporations. Withdrawal of federal support now ``would
seriously limit Sematech's operations and prospects for success,''
it said.

   President Bush on Tuesday telephoned the
astronauts of the space shuttle Atlantis to wish them well and
invite them to the White House.
   Bush chatted for three minutes with Capt. David M. Walker and
his four crew members, asking them about the accomplishments of
their mission and promising to do the best he could in the federal
budget for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   In what has come to be known as Bushspeak, the president queried
the astronauts about their deployment of a planetary probe for
Venus, asking: ``Look, how was the actual deployment thing. That
went smoothly as I recall.''
   He told the crew to visit him at the White House when they
return from their mission and see his dog Millie's new puppies.
   ``Unless you hurry up, the puppies are gone,'' he said. The
Bushes are giving the puppies away to family members.
   Atlantis' mission ended Monday when the 97-ton shuttle landed at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. after deploying Magellan, the
nation's first planetary probe in 11 years and the first ever to
ride a shuttle into space.
   ``I want you to come here, and it _ we're very proud of the job
you all did,'' Bush said.
   He added that, ``My only worries _ and they are worries that
affect absolutely everything that I want to do _ is budgetary
constraints. But we've got some, I think, reasonably good figures
in here now for NASA ... so we'll try to do our part from this
end.''

<HEAD>Party Reformist Demands Resignations In Exchange for Leadership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A reform-minded veteran chosen by the governing
party to restore public trust after a major scandal says he will
become prime minister only if all party officials linked to
corruption resign, sources said Tuesday.
   In the absence of other candidates with widespread support in
the Liberal Democratic Party, persuading former Foreign Minister
Masayoshi Ito appears to be the ``only solution for the time
being,'' party sources said on condition of anonymity.
   He is among a few senior party officials not connected to the
Recruit scandal.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and most other party leaders
have been linked to the influence-peddling affair, either through
political donations from Recruit Co. or profits made by aides on
bargain-priced stock shares offered by Recruit. Takeshita announced
April 25 he will step down to take responsibility.
   Although the party has not concluded its selection process
formally, Ito is seen as the man officials hope will win back
public trust before summer elections for half the seats in
Parliament's upper house.
   Ito refused to confirm his demands.
   ``I have said this many times _ I have no intention to become
the prime minister,'' he told reporters Tuesday.
   Ito has cited his age, 75, and health impaired by diabetes as
reasons for refusing.
   News reports, however, said he is holding out for reforms.
   The mass-circulation newspaper Asahi Shimbun said party
secretary-general Shintaro Abe rejected Ito's reform proposals as
``impractical,'' but it said Ito refused to discuss the leadership
unless he is assured some proposals will be implemented.
   Party sources said Ito has demanded the resignations of all
politicians implicated in the Recruit scandal and other corruption
cases, and an end to factions within the party.
   The relative strengths and desires of about half a dozen
factions have to be considered each time a Cabinet is formed.
   Ito also told a meeting of senior party officials Tuesday that
the party lacks a ``real sense of crisis,'' and he is not confident
he can conduct reforms under such circumstances, Kyodo News Service
and the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   ``Changing only on the surface won't do any good,'' Ito told
reporters Tuesday. ``Revolutionary changes in the party's way of
thinking are urgently needed.''
   Party officials said they have agreed to settle on a new leader
by the weekend. The party leader would become prime minister
because of the Liberal Democrats' large majority in Parliament.
   Meanwhile, Takeshita told former Cabinet Secretary Masaharu
Gotoda to draft a political reform package to present to the
current session of parliament, news reports said.
   They quoted Takeshita as telling Gotoda, ``Public distrust
toward politics caused by the Recruit scandal is quite serious, and
I'd like the (party) to draft a political reform plan as soon as
possible.''
   It will include new restrictions on political fund raising and
an asset disclosure law, they said.
   In the scandal, the information and publishing conglomerate
Recruit Co. made large donations to Takeshita and other leading
politicians, chiefly from the governing party, and sold
bargain-priced stock shares to about 160 politicians, businessmen
and others.
   Fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on
bribery and other charges, and three Cabinet ministers have
resigned.

<TEXT>
   Studies of hearths and discarded seashells
at old Indian sites suggest huge earthquakes struck the Northwest
in the last 300 to 400 years, far more recently than previously
believed, geologists said Tuesday.
   Rick Minor and Wendy Grant, geologists working along the Oregon
coast, presented papers to a Geological Society of America
convention correlating sudden, dramatic changes in land levels to
disruptions in Indian communities.
   The evidence suggests the last major quake was 300 to 400 years
ago, said Minor, who is with a consulting company in Eugene, Ore.,
and Grant, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist affiliated with the
University of Washington.
   ``A lot of people think these happened very long ago,'' said Ms.
Grant. ``But people were living here and were affected by these
erthquakes.''
   Previous evidence suggested the last major quake was 3,000 or
more years ago. The seismic events are believed to be caused by one
of the Earth's plates diving under another at fault line beneath
the Pacific Ocean.
   Chuck Steele of the Federal Emergency Management Administration
office in Bothell said the discovery of a quake so recent could
affect a Geological Survey study of the likelihood of an quake in
the region and how to deal with it.
   ``The sense of urgency is there,'' he said.
   The new information is significant because Oregon has been
regarded as one of the most seismically ``benign'' states in the
country, said Brian Atwater of the Geological Survey. Atwater
studied land levels in Washington and two years ago theorized that
the last major quake was 3,000 years ago.
   Grant said the research is the first to study the possible
effects of severe land movement on human populations.
   She said carbon dating of hearth sites and layers of shellfish
eaten by people living near the ocean show periods where habitation
abruptly ended.
   These periods can be correlated to evidence of dramatic drops in
land levels followed by a tsunami, a giant wave associated with
large earthquakes, Grant said.
   Scientists cautioned that carbon dating is imprecise and that
the evidence, while intriguing, is circumstantial.
   ``Clearly, much more work needs to be done on why people would
be forced to move, or change their subsistence patterns,''
cautioned Minor.
   ``The only explanation is that it was a large earthquake,'' said
Atwater. ``But to really nail it down, more research is needed.''
   He noted Indian folklore contains no such reference to what
would have been a significant event. But Minor speculated that
diseases introduced by European and American settlers may have
decimated the tribes, wiping out ancient oral traditions by the
time ethnographers began studying the tribes in the early 1900s.
   As many as 2,000 geologists from throughout the West are
expected to attend the convention, which runs through Thursday.

<BYLINE>Hospitalized Children Less Depressed Than Parents, Study Suggests
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospitalized child is less likely to get
depressed than his parents, but their reactions can affect his
level of distress, says a study released Tuesday.
   Researchers also were surprised to find children showed less
distress if they had more exposure to sometimes discomforting
medical procedures, said P. Alex Mabe, of the Medical College of
Georgia.
   Children may be able to become rapidly accustomed to such
experiences, Mabe said at a news conference at the annual meeting
of the American Psychiatric Association.
   Doctors have assumed for years that hospitalization caused
depression in children, but recent studies have questioned that,
Mabe said.
   His work, done with colleagues at his school, focused on 75
children, ages 6 to 15, who were admitted for treatment of a
variety of disorders. The children were assessed two to 10 days
after admission.
   Researchers found that seven of the children reported symptoms
that implied significant distress. But the measurements suggested
the hospitalized children experienced no greater distress than
children in the general population.
   In contrast, 24 percent of the parents reported moderate to
severe levels of depression.
   The reason for the difference was not clear, Mabe said. Parents
may be torn by competing responsibilities to the child and their
family at home. Or parents may be interpreting their feelings as an
emotional reaction, while the child simply considers his reactions
part of being physically sick, he said.
   Children who had depressive symptoms were more likely to have
mothers who were experiencing emotional distress, Mabe said.
   Perhaps the children use parents as an indicator to see how
depressing they should consider the hospitalization, he suggested.
Alternatively, a depressed parent may be less available to provide
support.
   In any case, the apparent link means helping the parents out of
depression may benefit both them and the child, he said.
   Mabe cautioned that the study results may be affected by the
fact that the work was done at a specialized hospital rather than a
primary-care institution, and that the children studied had
generally been hospitalized several times.
   Asked how parents can minimize the trauma of hospitalization for
a child, Mabe recommended taking an active role in the child's care.
   In another presentation at the news conference, Elizabeth Weller
of Ohio State University said many physicians do not know how to
diagnose depression in children and are giving anti-depressive
drugs when they may not be needed.
   A suspected case of child depression should be referred to an
expert for diagnosis, she said.
   Barbara Geller, of the University of South Carolina, said
anti-depressants have not yet been proven generally effective in
children.
   Some depressed children will probably turn out to be helped by
the drugs, she said, ``but at this point we can't select them out
as well as we would like to.''
   But a child who has not responded to psychological treatment may
still be a candidate for trying an anti-depressant, she said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by 42
congressmen and three states seeking to block the counting of
illegal aliens in the 1990 census, in part because they could not
prove they will lose seats in Congress by reapportionment.
   The plaintiffs said they feared states with more illegal aliens
would get a disproportionate number of House seats and electoral
votes, thus diminishing the political power of states with fewer
illegal aliens.
   The Census Bureau argued it is constitutionally obligated to
count everyone, including illegal aliens, for congressional
apportionment and has done so since the first census in 1790. House
seats are redistributed every 10 years to reflect population
changes.
   U.S. District Judge William L. Standish said, in a ruling filed
late Monday, that the plaintiffs cannot show they would be hurt by
the 1990 census because ``they are unable to establish how many
illegal aliens will be present ..., in which states these illegal
aliens will reside, or to what extent the illegal population will
come forward to be counted.''
   The lawsuit was filed last year by the congressmen, led by
Pennsylvania Republican Tom Ridge, and the states of Pennsylvania,
Kansas and Alabama.
   Ridge said Tuesday that Standish dismissed the lawsuit ``on
technical, legal grounds and not on the merits of the Census
Bureau's plans.''
   Ridge, recently named vice chairman of a House subcommittee that
oversees the Census Bureau, said he may appeal Standish's decision
and will introduce legislation in Congress to change the method of
the 1990 count.
   Standish's opinion noted that the congressmen's demographer
offered estimates that up to 5.6 million illegal aliens will be
counted in 1990. The demographer predicted a gain of up to four
congressional seats for California and one seat for Texas, and the
possible loss of one seat each for Georgia, Wisconsin, North
Carolina, Minnesota and Michigan.
   The judge noted another congressional analyst had predicted
gains for California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida at the
expense of Pennsylvania, Kansas, West Virginia and Alabama.
   But, the judge said, ``Based on the evidence offered, it is
sheer speculation as to the identities of the states that will be
affected by the inclusion of illegal aliens.''
   Standish also said the state governments of Pennsylvania, Kansas
and Alabama cannot show they would be damaged by ``reduced power or
prestige'' with the loss of congressional representation. He said
only the residents of the states might suffer and they did not file
the lawsuit.
   Standish noted that the non-profit Federation of American
Immigration Reform, a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, filed a similar
legal action in 1980 that was dismissed by a three-judge federal
panel in the District of Columbia.
   Ridge was joined by 19 colleagues from Pennsylvania, and others
from Kansas, West Virginia, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Wisconsin,
Alabama, California and Maryland.

   Former Postmaster General Paul N. Carlin has
charged in a civil suit that his successor, Albert V. Casey,
participated in a scheme to unseat him at the behest of a Texas
company seeking a $400 million contract.
   Carlin's $5 million suit charges that Casey, who was postmaster
general for seven months in 1986, lent his name and prestige to an
effort by Recognition Equipment Inc., to obtain a sole-source
contract to produce electronic ZIP code scanning equipment.
   The Dallas-based company and two of its executives, William G.
Moore Jr. and Robert W. Reedy, are awaiting trial here on
conspiracy charges stemming from an alleged scheme to influence the
contract award in which $19,000 was paid to Postal Service governor
Peter Voss.
   Casey is not charged in the criminal case but the indictment
maintains that the alleged contract-rigging scheme included an
effort to replace Carlin with someone REI considered more
sympathetic to its effort to sell the Postal Service $400 million
worth of optical-scanning equipment.
   Casey's Washington attorney, Hamilton P. Fox, said Tuesday that
his client had no knowledge of REI's interest in a contract before
he became postmaster general.
   ``The grand jury has investigated this thing. There is just no
evidence at all to support that allegation,'' Fox said.
   There was no answer at Casey's office in Dallas.
   Carlin's lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court here, is
the latest in a series of civil actions in the wake of the
three-year investigation that so far has yielded three convictions.
   Voss is among three people who have pleaded guilty in connection
with the investigation and is cooperating with prosecutors.
   Carlin claims that Casey is liable for civil damages under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act but does not
charge that he participated in the bribery scheme.
   Carlin's suit recites bribery allegations contained in other
criminal cases against REI, Moore, Reedy and others.
   The suit charges that Casey ``was aware of REI's difficulties in
obtaining a sole-source Postal Service contract'' because of his
friendship with Robert Crandall, a former American Airlines
president who was a director of REI.
   By taking the job, Casey was ``lending himself and his prestige
to the conspiracy to obtain a contract for REI, and thus to further
the interests of the conspirators by doing their bidding after hjs
appointment.''
   The suit also alleges that at Voss's behest, Casey removed James
V. Jellison as deputy postmaster general. Jellison was viewed by
REI as another obstacle to the company's contract proposal.
   Jellison, who retired rather than accept another job in the
Postal Service, has filed a separate lawsuit that, among other
things, charges Casey with infliction of emotional distress.
   Carlin claimed in the lawsuit that his abrupt replacement by
Casey damaged his reputation. ``The stop-gap nature of Casey's
tenure left the inference that he was taking the job ... because of
some situation involving Carlin personally, when in fact there was
no such situation or emergency.''
   Last week, the Justice Department filed a civil suit against
REI, claiming damages arising from the alleged contract-rigging
scheme. The company has also been sued by several shareholders'
groups.

   Officials said Tuesday the government has asked
Washington to explain the loss of a nuclear bomb 200 miles from
Okinawa in 1965, which has inspired anger among Okinawans and
charges of a U.S. coverup.
   An A-4 Skyhawk jet carrying the bomb fell off the U.S. aircraft
carrier Ticonderoga about 80 miles from a small island that is part
of the Okinawa prefecture, an American military spokesman in Japan
said. The ship was bound from Vietnam to Yokosuka, Japan.
   Newsweek magazine initially reported the story, saying the bomb
disappeared 70 miles from an inhabited Japanese island. On Monday,
Japan made an informal request for information from the United
States.
   The case added an irritant to U.S. military relations with
Okinawa, a Japanese island where one of the bloodiest battles of
World War II was fought. The continued presence of 35,000 American
soldiers on Okinawa has led to tension and protests about such
problems as accidents on target ranges.
   Asahi, a national newspaper, said in an editorial Wednsday the
``incident is of such a nature that we simply cannot let it pass,
however long ago it occurred.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said privately on Tuesday: ``This
happened in international waters so we have no right to make a loud
demand. We are just asking the United States to give us an
explanation. We are interested and concerned'' about the details.
   Other officials said the government did not know the location or
condition of the B-43 bomb and there had been no discussions with
the United States of what to do about it.
   Newsweek quoted nuclear expert William Arkin of the Institute
for Policy Studies in Washington as saying the U.S. Navy kept the
incident secret until a 1981 Pentagon report listed accidents
involving nuclear weapons.
   Washington ``did not bring it to our attention'' at the time of
the report, the Foreign Office official said.
   Japan is the only country attacked with nuclear weapons and bans
them from its territory. The lost one-megaton bomb was about 70
times as powerful as the one dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945,
Kyodo News Service reported.
   Arkin was quoted as saying there was little danger of
detonation, but the 33 pounds of plutonium in the bomb could
threaten the environment as it deteriorated.
   The Ticonderoga, an attack carrier, was on a mission that
included readiness to launch a nuclear strike, said a declassified
U.S. Navy document released by Arkin and the environmental group
Greenpeace.
   That raised the possibility of the carrier entering Yokosuka,
south of Tokyo, with nuclear arms despite the Japanese ban.
   In Washingon on Monday, Arkin said: ``There is no doubt in my
mind that U.S. ships still transit Japan with nuclear weapons
aboard.''
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard denied any attempt
to conceal what had happened.
   ``It was way out to sea in international waters,'' he said
Tuesday. ``The weapon went down in 16,000 feet of water. There was
no danger to anyone other than the unfortunate pilot of the
aircraft in this incident. There was not then and there is not
now.''
   Asked whether he would deny that Navy ships entered Japanese
waters carrying nuclear weapons, Howard replied: ``We are aware of
the special sentiments of the Japanese people with regard to
nuclear weapons. We have faithfully honored our obligations under
the U.S.-Japanese Treaty of Mutual Security and its related
arrangements, and we'll continue to do so.''
   He would not say whether the United States considered that a
port call by a warship constituted introducing nuclear weapons to
Japan.
   Japanese opposition parties and citizens' organizations have
claimed U.S. Navy ships routinely visit Japanese ports carrying
nuclear weapons, with the government's tacit agreement.
   Government officials said the United States is not allowed to
bring in such weapons without prior consultation, and there have
been no such consultations.
   The Asahi editorial said: ``If the aircraft carrier had docked
at Yokosuka without the accident having taken place, the United
States would have been censured as violating the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty'' requiring consultation.
   ``Besides, it is hardly conceivable that the Skyhawk in question
was alone armed with a nuke,'' the paper said. ``Which Japanese
port did the carrier eventually visit after the hydrogen bomb was
lost?''
   Asking what has become of the bomb, the Asahi editorial said
Wednesday: ``Has it not been crushed by the water pressure? Has
radioactive material not leaked from it, bit by bit?''

<HEAD>Researchers Say Foreign Investment in U.S. Cost American Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Instead of being a boon to U.S. employment,
the surge of foreign investment in the United States during the
mid-1980s cost America more jobs than it created, two researchers
said Tuesday.
   The tripling of foreign investment during the 1980s came largely
from takeovers of existing companies rather than construction of
new plants and offices, said Norman Glickman, director of the
Center for Urban Policy Research and State of New Jersey Professor
of Planning at Rutgers University.
   ``It's primarily a shift in ownership from an American owner to
a foreign owner,'' Glickman said. ``This does not necessarily
create jobs and often it can in fact destroy jobs.''
   In a new book, ``The New Competitors,'' Glickman and Douglas
Woodward, assistant professor of economics at the University of
South Carolina, said they found that foreign investment rose to
$262 billion in 1987, triple the amount of direct investment at the
start of the decade.
   They discussed their findings at a news conference sponsored by
the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed think tank based in
Washington.
   The authors found that while foreign firms or their affiliates
employ about 3 million workers, most of those employees represent
``the transfer of old jobs from an American to a foreign boss.''
   From 1982 to 1986, foreign investors cut 56,000 more jobs
through layoffs than they created through new plants and expansion,
the researchers said.
   Even excluding the 1982-83 recession years, only about 15,000 to
20,000 jobs a year were created by foreign investment, ``a very
small number in a 100 million-job economy,'' Glickman said.
   Glickman said the Japanese have been the most likely to invest
in new plants and create jobs in the United States, but have been
``the greatest recipients of xenophobia in this country.''
   He said that even as foreign companies have created few new
jobs, they exert little control over the U.S. economy. While
foreign companies employ 3 percent of American workers and own 8
percent of the nation's assets, ``those are still relatively small
numbers,'' he said.
   ``They are growing fast and they are of considerable concern,''
Glickman said. ``But at present, that's an issue which we need to
watch but not be as fearful of.''
   Glickman said foreign investment in the United States has
worsened the nation's trade deficit because the companies' exports
are overshadowed by imports of intermediate goods used in
production.
   Foreign investors had a net trade deficit of about $8 billion in
1986 and the rate has increased since then, Glickman said.
   The authors called for the creation of a government agency to
analyze the economic impact of major foreign investments.
   Woodward said that because the addition of a new foreign-owned
plant can be a big boon to a particular region, local officials
have engaged in counterproductive ``global smokestack chasing,''
offering huge incentives to lure plants their way.
   ``Our mayors and governors are falling all over themselves,''
Woodward said. ``They're frequent fliers at the government's
expense, as if they've discovered this holy grail for economic
development.''
   Woodward said the incentives being offered in some cases cost
tens of thousands of dollars for each job created without holding
companies accountable for a specific contribution to the local
economy.

<HEAD>WHO Representatives Seek Compromise on PLO Bid for Membership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Delegates to the World Health Organization's
annual assembly worked nervously Tuesday to head off a showdown
with the United States over a PLO request for full membership in
the U.N. body.
   Diplomatic sources said a proposal to put off the decision in
exchange for greater medical aid to Palestinians was gaining
support.
   In a move aggravating tensions, the Palestine Liberation
Organization submitted a separate request Tuesday to be recognized
as a full member by another U.N. agency, Paris-based UNESCO.
   Since the Palestine National Council, which acts as a
parliament-in-exile, proclaimed the state of Palestine last
November, the PLO has been seeking full membership as a state in
all U.N. agencies. It now holds non-voting observer status.
   The United States and its Western allies have not recognized the
new state, which controls no territory. Washington, which pays 25
percent of WHO's regular budget of $625 million for 1988-89, has
threatened to withdraw its money if Palestine is recognized as the
167th member of WHO.
   Diplomats at the WHO assembly, which began Monday, worked
tensely Tuesday in search of a compromise. A senior West European
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was a
general desire to reach a compromise, ``but it is like walking on
eggs.''
   Another source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said
there was growing support for a proposal to combine a postponement
of a decision on PLO membership with increased medical assistance
to Palestinian residents of the Israeli-occupied territories.
   A report by a WHO committee, published Tuesday, said health
services there have remained the same or even deteriorated over the
past four years.
   The authors of the compromise proposal, in a bid to gain PLO
support, suggested that it also express the ``hope'' that ``the
people of Palestine'' would be fully represented in WHO at some
later time, the source said.
   He said most Western countries, the Soviet bloc, and some Third
World countries have indicated support for such language.
   However, sources at the assembly said the United States has
opposed that wording, arguing it implies recognition of Palestinian
statehood.
   Addressing the WHO session, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, U.S.
Secretary of Health and Human Services, made no reference to
Washington's threat to withdraw funding. But he called on the more
than 1,000 delegates not to let themselves be ``diverted by
political issues.''
   WHO Director-General Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, in a reference to the
U.S. warning, urged the meeting earlier ``to come to a decision
that will not jeopardize the survival of our organization.''
   In Paris, the PLO presented a letter to Federico Mayor, director
general of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, to ask for recognition as a member state.
   The PLO's UNESCO representative, Omar Massalha, said the request
would be put on the agenda of UNESCO's executive board. The body
begins a five-week meeting May 17.
   Final approval, however, must be given by a two-thirds majority
of the 158-nation UNESCO General Conference, which meets in
November.
   Massalha said a nation's vote in favor of the PLO request would
not amount to diplomatic recognization by that country.
   The United States withdrew from UNESCO in 1984, charging it was
too political and mismanaged.

<HEAD>Bush To Propose Turning Family Planning Over To States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will soon propoose legislation
to transfer federal family planning programs _ which generate
continual controversy over abortion _ to state control, the
administration's top family planning official told a Senate panel
Tuesday.
   ``Making the states the sole family planning grantees will
enable them to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring services
to best meet their citizens' needs,'' said Nabers Chambers, deputy
assistant secretary for population affairs at the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   In advocating the transfer, she did not specifically mention
differences over how far federally funded family planning clinics
can go in telling pregnant women about the availablity of abortion,
a matter now being fought over in three separate federal court
suits.
   But Ms. Chambers said giving states authority over how to parcel
out the federal money allocated to them for family planning would
allow them ``flexibility to operate clinics through county
agencies, private agencies, or hospitals as is most appropriate for
each particular state.''
   Congress consistently rejected similar efforts by President
Reagan to transfer the program to state control.
   Ms. Chambers, a holdover from the Reagan administration, headed
the department's Office of Population Affairs last year when
regulations were put in place designed to bar counselors in
federally funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion
with their clients.
   Two of three federal district judges who considered the case
quickly found the regulations in violation of the Public Health
Service Act and an appeals court in Boston recently upheld one of
those two rulings.
   Prior to the appeals court decision, the administration sought
to apply the regulations in parts of the nation not covered by a
court order against them. Ms. Chambers told the Senate committee it
is too soon to say if the administration will pursue that policy in
light of the appeals court decision.
   Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, complained the program ``has been subjected to both
political harassment and administration confusion'' since 1981,
when Reagan took office.
   ``Thanks to the efforts of the program's congressional
supporters, and to the basic strength of the program itself, Title
X has largely withstood this array of assaults,'' she said. ``But
they have taken their toll, and the open attacks on Title X that
have been ongoing since 1981 must end.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the committee chairman, opened
the hearing by stating his intention to have the panel approve a
three-year reauthorization of the family planning legislation on
Friday, observing that the issues are already well known to
committee members.
   Although the program has not been formally reauthorized since
1981, it has continued to operate with annual appropriations based
on the underlying 1981 law.
   Ms. Chambers said $138.3 million is being spent in federal money
this year to provide family planning services through 88 grant
receipients at 4,000 clinics to an estimated 4.3 million women _
about a third of them adolescents.

<TEXT>
   Government troops have launched a
major offensive against anti-communist rebels besieging the eastern
city of Jalalabad, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``We are now in the offensive position,'' said Mohammad Nabi
Amani. ``In the last three days we have started concentrating on
the enemy positions. We would like to vanish the enemy from the
city and then start moving out.''
   The report could not be confirmed independently.
   Amani gave few details but said there was fighting north and
east of the city, and 37 guerrillas have been killed and 27 wounded
since Monday night.
   Despite the counterattacks, the U.S.-backed Moslem rebels fired
rockets into Jalalabad late Monday and Tuesday that killed four
civilians and a government soldier and destroyed 11 houses and a
mosque, according to Amani. He did not mention other casualties
among the government forces at Jalalabad, 75 miles east of the
capital of Kabul.
   Amani also reported a battle at Sarobin, about half way between
Jalalabad and Kabul and 15 rebels trying to block the main supply
highway were slain.
   He said three rockets struck Kabul early Tuesday but reported no
casualties.
   Amani's report indicated the Marxist government of President
Najib was making a major effort to lift the siege of Jalalabad that
began March 6 when guerrillas captured the nearby garrison town of
Samarkel.
   Amani said Samarkel was retaken by government forces but he had
no reports about the surrounding districts.
   The rebels' siege of Jalalabad has been their most concentrated
and sustained effort since the Soviet Union withdrew its remaining
troops from Afghanistan in mid-February. The Soviets sent troops
into Afghanistan in December 1979 and for years had more than
100,000 military personnel in the country in an unsuccessful effort
to crush the revolt.
   Government sources said Tuesday that troops were preparing for a
rebel assault on the southern city of Kandahar and repeated the
claim that Pakistan would provide support for the guerrillas.
   Kandahar, about 300 miles southwest of Kabul, is considered more
vulnerable than Jalalabad.
   Najib has claimed Pakistan is deploying about 15,000 soldiers
across the border near Quetta to help in an attack on Kandahar, 60
miles west of the frontier. Quetta is 50 miles east of the border.
   The sources, speaking on the condition they not be identified,
said the rebels were expected to launch the attack this week to
mark the end of a three-day feast following the Islamic holy month
of Ramadan.
   The rebels have been trying to capture an Afghan city for a base
for their government-in-exile they established in February in
Pakistan.
   Pakistan and the United States have provided supplies to the
rebels but Pakistan has denied repeated claims by the Afghan
government that it is sending troops into Afghanistan to suport the
rebels.
   The Soviet Union continues to supply weapons and ammunition to
Najib's troops.
   Before the civil war began more than 10 years ago, Kandahar was
Afghanistan's second-largest city after Kabul. But tens of
thousands of people fled the city because of the fighting, and
government officials say they don't know how many remain.

   Failures by the Iowa Interstate Railroad and
the Federal Railroad Administration to enforce train operating
rules and a tired train crew's error caused the fiery collision of
two freight trains in Altoona, Iowa, last summer, federal safety
officials concluded Tuesday.
   The July 30 head-on crash killed two crewmen on a westbound
train en route from Newton, Iowa, to Des Moines when it collided
with a train bound from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Chicago. The two
employees on the eastbound train jumped to safety.
   More than 2,000 people were evacuated from their homes in and
around Altoona as two tank cars containing 20,000 gallons of
denatured alcohol burned for more than two days.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the eastbound
train, with 78 cars, departed Altoona before its permitted time.
Its crew had been on duty for nearly 10 hours after having only
four or five hours of sleep the night before, the board said.
   ``Contributing to the train crew's failure to comply with the
wait provisions was a combination of fatigue induced by irregular
work-rest schedules, preoccupation with completing their asisgnment
prior to exceeding duty time limits, inexperience, `mental set' or
expectations based on previously issued train orders, the work
activities which intervened since they recieved the train order,
and the failure of (the railroad) to properly train its crews,''
the board said in its finding of a probable cause.
   The board said Iowa Interstate, which operated both trains, had
no way of knowing that the westbound train had departed its initial
terminal because it did not maintain a record of train movements as
required by federal regulations.
   It said, however, the westbound train was being operated
properly and would have had time to clear the area if the eastbound
train had not pulled onto the track early.
   The board cited several deficiencies in the railroad's training
programs and proficiency testing of its employees.
   The Federal Railroad Administration, the board said, failed to
take action against the railroad for not complying with federal
rules. It recommended that the agency conduct a safety audit of
Iowa Interstate.
   The board also recommended that several steps be taken to
decrease the likelihood of tanker cars catching fire, including
improved design to ensure that closure fittings stay closed in
accidents that do not rupture the tank itself. The report said that
release of the alcohol from pressure release valves contributed to
the length of the emergency.
   The board said there was no evidence that any mechanical problem
with either train or track conditions contributed to the crash, or
that alcohol or drug use was a factor.

   President Bush's nomination of a former
right-to-life spokeswoman for top public affairs job at the
Department of Health and Human Services won approval of a Senate
committee on Tuesday despite opposition from Planned Parenthood.
   The pro-choice group, in a letter to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, charged Kay
James' appointment was ``part of the White House reparations
payment'' to satisfy abortion opponents upset by HHS Secretary
Louis Sullivan's early statements supporting a woman's right to
choose.
   ``Her appointment is nothing more than a gift from the Bush
White House to the anti-abortion movement,'' William W. Hamilton
Jr., director of Planned Parenthood Federation of America's
Washington office, said in the letter.
   James told the committee her personal views would not get in the
way of her duties to speak for the government.
   ``It's my job to articulate government policy,'' James said. ``I
have my personal views ... (but) my job isn't to represent my
views. My job is to represent the U.S. government.''
   On the issue of abortion, she said, representing the government
position would be easy since the president opposes abortion except
in cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother's life. Sullivan,
after his initial comments, said he shares Bush's view.
   ``I can serve them both well,'' James said.
   The committee approved Bush's nomination of James by a voice
vote.

   Entertainer Pat Boone, who used his Lamb &amp;
Lion Records label to spread a Christian message through music, is
seeking reorganization of the label through the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.
   Lamb &amp; Lion, whose most popular artist is Boone's daughter
Debby, has piled up $355,689 in debts with $62,416 in assets,
according to court papers quoted in Tuesday's editions of the Los
Angeles Times.
   The record label filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankrupty law last September, the newspaper said.
   Bell Savings of San Mateo sued the label in late 1987,
contending that Boone and a former Lamb &amp; Lion executive created
``a fraudulent plan'' to divert $200,000 owed to the savings and
loan to themselves.
   ``The record company is very precious to me and my family,''
Boone said Tuesday. ``We had to restructure,'' he added.
   ``We had to hold Bell Savings off,'' Boone said. ``They wanted
full payment of a loan and we weren't prepared to do that. We have
worked out an amicable settlement with Bell now.''
   Boone's attorney, Richard Green, denied Bell's accusations,
saying a settlement is being worked out.
   Boone, 54, founded the label in 1983. Daughter Debby, best known
for her 1977 hit ``You Light Up My Life,'' recorded albums that
sold more than 100,000 copies each. But the label had no performers
in the million-selling category.
   ``There's nothing complicated to it. Not enough people were
buying their product,'' said Joseph A. Eisenberg, a Lamb &amp; Lion
bankruptcy lawyer.

<HEAD>Customs Officials Challenge Judge Ruling Over Noriega Documents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs authorities on Tuesday challenged a court
ruling preventing them from handing over to U.S. drug enforcement
agencies documents belonging to Panama's de facto ruler, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Customs agents seeking evidence in a drugs-related,
money-laundering case said they found Noriega family accounts by
chance after raiding a bank in London last October.
   Customs lawyer Andrew Collins said the investigation was not
aimed at Noriega, who was indicted in Florida last year on U.S.
drug trafficking charges. Noriega denied the charges.
   Commissioners of the Customs and Excise Department argued that a
judge's ban on U.S. authorities seeing details of the Noriega
family accounts was unreasonable and interfered with the battle
against global drug dealing.
   Collins told the Court of Appeal the early-morning bank raid
coincided with swoops by drug trade investigators in the United
States.
   Individuals in 10 U.S. cities and Paris and London were accused
of taking part in a ring that laundered profits from the Colombian
cocaine trade through the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, or BCCI Holdings.
   BCCI, two subsidiaries and nine bank officials were charged with
laundering $14 million in drug profits collected from seven U.S.
cities.
   Collins said agents obtained a warrant to enter the bank's
London office and then discovered the office of one suspect was in
an adjoining building.
   He said agents quickly obtained an additional warrant to enter
that building and found a locked cabinet containing files and
accounts belonging to Noriega, his wife Felicidad, daughters Lorena
and Sandra and son-in-law Jean Rene de Beauchamp.
   Collins said the Customs officer believed the files would be
important in investigating Noriega's alleged involvement in drug
trafficking and possibly would help in the BCCI investigation.
   The officer could not remove the documents under the warrant, so
he applied to Southwark Crown Court Judge Valerie Pearlman for an
order requiring the bank to produce the documents for inspection
and the judge so ordered, Collins said.
   The bank challenged the order. The judge upheld the order but
only on condition that U.S. drug enforcement agencies were not
given the documents.
   Collins said the judge was concerned about `an alleged risk to
the bank and its employees in Panama if material was passed on to
the U.S.''
   He asked the Court of Appeal to quash the ruling, saying the law
``makes it perfectly clear that what should concern the court ...
is not only drug trafficking in this country but drug trafficking
in any other country in the world.''
   The hearing is expected to take at least two days.

<HEAD>Energy Official Says Public Fears Could Doom Nuclear Power</HEAD>

   The United States could lose nuclear power as
an energy source unless public confidence in its safety is
restored, a senior Energy Department official said Tuesday.
   ``Without restoration of public understanding of the efficacy
and safety of nuclear power ... there may never well be another
nuclear power plant ordered in the United States,'' John C. Tuck,
the undersecretary of energy, told a nuclear industry group.
   Tuck, in his first major public address since being confirmed
last month as the No. 3 official in the Energy Department, said the
department strongly supported nuclear power and would do everything
possible to help the industry expand.
   ``Rest assured that the Department of Energy will at every
opportunity advocate vigorously on behalf of nuclear energy,'' Tuck
told the Nuclear Power Assembly, the industry's annual meeting.
   ``We will make the case for nuclear power before the American
people, and we will be forceful advocates,'' Tuck said. He
reiterated the department's recent vow to try to prevent New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo from tearing down the Shoreham nuclear plant on
Long Island.
   Shoreham got its operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission last month, but Cuomo and the plant's owner have agreed
to dismantle it. State and local officials say Long Island could
not be evacuated in the event of a severe accident.
   Lando W. Zech Jr., chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, told the nuclear assembly he was concerned by the fact
that no nuclear plant had been ordered since 1978 and that none
currently was planned. He said the commission's recent decision to
streamline the licensing process could help the industry rebound.
   Zech called the licensing decision ``perhaps the most important
change ever made to the NRC's power reactor licensing process,''
and said it would lead to safer reactor designs.
   In another development, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., introduced a
bill Tuesday to abolish the NRC and replace it with a Nuclear
Safety Agency headed by a single administrator. He said the
five-member commission and its staff had undermined public
confidence in nuclear power by becoming too cozy with the industry.
   A similar bill passed the Senate last year but died in the House.

<HEAD>Former Prosecutor Poised for Leap into Mayoral Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rudolph W. Giuliani prepared Tuesday to dive
into the race for mayor, counting on his appeal as a crime-fighting
prosecutor to overcome his Republican affiliation in this
overwhelmingly Democratic city.
   Giuliani, who gained fame with a string of high-profile
prosecutions as U.S. attorney in Manhattan, hopes to fashion a
fusion candidacy in the mold of John V. Lindsay in 1965, the last
Republican to win City Hall.
   Giuliani's formal announcement was scheduled Wednesday, ending a
year and a half of speculation about his political future that
continued even as he was putting mobsters, Wall Street cheats and
corrupt politicians in jail.
   ``The city is in very, very bad shape, and the mayor is
responsible for it,'' Giuliani, 44, said in February, while still
considering his prospects. ``The city is in a grave crisis and I
think it's time for new leadership.''
   His decision to offer himself for mayor was bolstered by polls
that have consistently shown him defeating incumbent Mayor Edward
I. Koch or any other likely Democratic nominee in a hypothetical
matchup.
   Giuliani has said for months that he would run only if he
appeared to have enough support to win. But in a city where
Democrats outnumber Republicans 5-1, his victory is by no means
assured.
   He started with a bold, potentially risky stroke last month,
winning the endorsement of the city's tiny Liberal Party and
assuring himself a place on the November ballot. Lindsay did the
same thing.
   Giuliani's next must tackle the Republican primary. He faces a
well-financed challenge from cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, who's
running as a conservative more in tune with New York's GOP
stalwarts.
   ``The Republican Party has an obligation to choose a candidate
that represents its principles,'' said Nelson Warfield, Lauder's
spokesman. ``We think that Ronald Lauder is that candidate. Rudy
Giuliani, with the Liberal Party endorsement, can't ride two horses
at one time.''
   Giuliani has not ruled out tax increases, Warfield said; Lauder
has.
   Next on the Giuliani-bashing line was Koch, who has been
charging recently that Giuliani can't be counted on to continue
city support of abortions for poor women because Giuliani
personally opposes abortion.
   Giuliani campaign spokesman Charles Perkins said Tuesday that as
mayor Giuliani would continue to fund abortions at current levels.
   Perkins added that Giuliani preferred to focus on ``the issues
the mayor has some ability to confront and resolve, like crime and
drugs and the health care system and the infrastructure.''
   Giuliani also promised to make an issue of integrity. Corruption
scandals have rocked city government, but not touched Koch, since
1986. Giuliani prosecuted the most prominent of those cases,
winning a racketeering conviction of Bronx Democratic boss Stanley
Friedman.
   Following that case, Giuliani was mentioned last year as a
challenger to Democratic U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
Giuliani flirted with the notion, dropped it, then left the
prosecutor's office in January after 5{ years to explore the
mayoral race.
   Koch, his popularity lagging, could lose the Democratic
nomination. Challenger David Dinkins, the Manhattan borough
president, leads in polls. And Giuliani leads in polls pitting him
against Dinkins.
   But it is four months before the primaries, six months before
the general election, and Giuliani, who never has held elective
office, is untried as a campaigner in New York's barefisted
political ring.
   Asked for comment about Giuliani's candidacy, Koch spokesman Lee
Jones said, ``We just think in November he'll regret it.''

<HEAD>Congress Asked to Nullify Canal Treaty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., introduced
legislation Tuesday calling on the Bush administration to nullify
the Panama Canal treaties in light of reports of election fraud in
Panama's presidential elections.
   Mack said the move is justified because it is clear the
country's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, ``is
stealing the presidential election from the Panamanian people.''
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
president has ``no plan to abrogate the canal treaties.''
   Mack acted after examining the conduct of Sunday's election in
Panama as a member of a White House observer team.
   The Panama Canal treaties, ratified in 1977, provide for Panama
to take control of the canal at the end of 1999.
   ``If we were facing this same situation in 1999 rather than
1989, Congress would be falling all over itself looking for a way
to keep control of the canal,'' Mack said. ``Let's work now to
address our concerns with the canal so we're not forced to confront
the issue later,'' Mack said.
   It was not clear whether Mack would be able to muster majority
support for his legislation.
   But apparent fraud in the elections in Panama stirred widespread
condemnation on Capitol Hill.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., said members of the observer delegation
had told the president ``that we saw such widespread irregularities
and actual fraud that we didn't see any way that it could be a free
and fair election.''
   ``Friends of freedom everywhere share a growing sense of outrage
over the flagrant fraud being committed by Gen. Noriega in his
desperate effort to steal the election and stay in power,'' said
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``Gen. Noriega is a disgrace to democracy,'' Kennedy said. ``No
amount of fraud can conceal his overwhelming repudiation by the
citizens of his country.''
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., another member of the observer team,
urged Bush to withdraw U.S. military dependents and U.S. civilians
from Panama while increasing the number of combatants among the
10,000 U.S. troops stationed there to protect the canal.
   But Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said the actual use of military
force was ``the last option you would consider.''
   ``I don't believe the first thing we are going to see is some
sort of war-room exercise of people deciding when they are going to
the mat with Noriega militarily,'' Smith said. ``It's just not
happening.''

   President Bush, in his first public comment on
the Oliver North verdict, said Tuesday he had ``wanted all along to
see him exonerated.''
   Asked if he thought North, who was found guilty last Thursday on
three of 12 felony counts, was innocent, the president said: ``I'm
not going to argue with the courts. The process is being appealed.
He's entitled to the right of appeal without a lot of editorial
comment from me, although I've already given you some.''
   Bush was asked about North at the end of an interview with a
group of reporters in the Oval Office.
   On another subject, Bush brushed aside a dispute with West
Germany over short-range nuclear missiles, an issue which threatens
the harmony of a NATO summit May 29-30.
   ``I have a good feeling that there's been a lot of smoke out
there and we'll have a smooth summit,'' Bush said. Asked if that
meant he was willing to compromise, Bush replied, ``It might mean
people are willing to do it our way _ with the United States.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called for East-West
negotiations soon to reduce short-range weapons in Europe, but the
Bush administration has argued that they are needed to compensate
for an overwhelming superiority in conventional forces by the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Bush also discussed the issue in private with a Dutch delegation
led by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers.
   The president summoned reporters to his office to declare that
Panama's presidential election on Sunday was marred by fraud and to
call on Manuel Antonio Noriega to ``heed the call of the people''
and relinquish power.
   ``And I call on all foreign leaders to urge General Noriega to
honor the clear results of the election,'' Bush said.
   On a personal matter, Bush will undergo a routine physical
examination, his first as president, at Bethesda Naval Hospital on
Wednesday.
   Bush, 64, told reporters, ``Never felt better in my life.''
   As for North, the former White House aide is awaiting sentencing
on his convictions of illegally destroying and altering government
documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and abetting in
obstruction of Congress' investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   White House officials have said Bush has not discussed the
possibility of a pardon for North.
   Bush, when asked his reaction to the verdict, said, ``As you
know, I wanted all along to see him exonerated. The matter is now
under appeal, and thus I'll have nothing more to say about it while
it is.''
   As the interview broke up, he was asked, ``You don't believe in
shredding documents, do you?''
   ``I believe in taking them with me,'' he joked.
   Bush said several times during the 1988 presidential campaign
that he believed North would be aquitted of charges stemming from
his role in the Reagan administration's efforts to help the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   He has also called North a hero, saying he was referring to the
retired Marine lieutenant colonel's record in Vietnam.
   A government-approved document introduced during North's trial
said Bush met early in 1985 in Honduras with then-president Roberto
Suazo. It said Bush informed Suazo of then-President Reagan's
decision to speed U.S. military and economic aid to the country _
expedited aid that the document said had been approved as part of a
deal to gain Honduran support for the Contras.
   The document did not say Bush was part of any such deal, and he
said emphatically last week that despite what the document said
there was no deal, ``no quid pro quo.''

   The nation's Big Three automakers said Tuesday
they're working as fast as they can to eliminate from car air
conditioners a chemical that attacks the Earth's ozone layer, but
it may not be fast enough.
   The Vermont Legislature has passed and the governor is expected
to sign a bill that after 1993 would outlaw the registration of
vehicles whose air conditioners contain CFC-12.
   CFC-12 is a type of chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, a class of
chemicals best known under the trade name Freon. Most other CFC
applications, such as refrigerators, use different types of CFC.
   Chlorofluorocarbons that rise into the upper atmosphere attack
the protective ozone layer. Scientists say that lets in extra
ultraviolet radiation that increases the number of cases of skin
cancer and eye disease and that damages plants and animals crucial
to the food chain.
   Researchers at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. and their suppliers have been looking for ways to eliminate
CFC-12 from their cars' air conditioning systems.
   Most of the research is going into a substance called 134-A,
which contains no chlorofluorocarbons.
   ``Work is continuing as if it is the substance of choice,'' said
Douglas Mark, an emission engineer for GM.
   But there are problems.
   ``There is no (compatible) lubricant and the toxicological
testing is not finished,'' said Norm Nielsen, supervisor of
government regulatory programs at Chrysler. ``Officially, it will
take three or four years to finish.''
   Mark noted that long-term health tests of 134-A are expected to
go through 1992, when the 1993 model-year vehicles mentioned in the
Vermont law will be in production.
   The automobile industry has learned to live with California
regulations governing exhaust emissions that are stiffer than other
states. Cars made for sale in California have different exhaust
emission control systems than for general sale.
   But officials of the Big Three automakers say there are more
problems switching from CFC-12 to something else than in switching
equipment to meet California air quality standards.
   ``The whole system has to be changed,'' Mark said. ``There's got
to be compressor and evaporator changes. Materials have to be
re-evaluated for seals and hoses.''

   Israel remembered its war dead on Tuesday and
celebrated its independence, but the twin tributes to a tumultuous
past were marred by more bloodshed in the Palestinian uprising.
   Soldiers in the occupied West Bank fatally shot one Palestinian
and wounded two in a raid on the village of Salfit, an army
official said. Arab reports said troopers wounded seven more
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In the Arab-Jewish city of Akko in northern Israel, a
27-year-old Jew fatally stabbed a 14-year-old Arab.
   An Arab motorist caught the assailant, who has a history of
mental illness, police reported. They said the assailant told the
motorist he stabbed the boy to avenge Arab attacks on Jews.
   The two deaths brought to 467 the number of Palestinians killed
in the uprising. Twenty-one Israelis also have died.
   The violence came as Palestinians observed a general strike
called by pro-PLO underground leaders to mark the beginning of the
18th month of the uprising.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands were blocked by the army from
entering Israel during Memorial and Independence Day holidays to
prevent attacks on Israeli targets.
   Memorial Day, during which Israel's 16,740 war dead are honored,
began at sundown Monday and ended at sundown Tuesday, immediately
followed by 24 hours of celebrations marking the 41st anniversary
of Israel's independence.
   About 700,000 Gaza residents and 200,000 Palestinians in the
West Bank were kept under curfew. All 1 million West Bank residents
were barred from entering Israel during the two-day holiday.
   On Tuesday, a two-minute siren during which Israelis nationwide
stood at attention ushered in somber wreath-laying ceremonies at 40
military cemeteries.
   Most speeches focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel's Arab enemies,
including the leaders of the uprising, have not changed their
ultimate objective, the destruction of Israel.
   ``Our enemies have the same aim, to remove us from here, even if
guns, tanks and planes are replaced with stones, knives and
firebombs,'' Rabin told mourning families at the Kiryat Shaul
cemetery near Tel Aviv.
   In an interview published Tuesday in the Maariv newspaper, he
said he may order harsher tactics by soldiers to crush the uprising
_ ``not tanks or air strikes, but more freedom for selective
treatment or selective punishment.''
   At a ceremony at the Kfar Warburg cemetery in southern Israel,
mourners heckled left-wing legislator Dedi Zucker, shouting ``Get
him out! Get him out!''
   Zucker, a reserve paratrooper who favors negotiations with the
PLO and has been critical of the army's crackdown of the uprising,
said he did not deliver his scheduled speech, fearing it would fuel
more anger.
   He said the outburst appeared to have been sparked by Monday's
funeral of Sgt. Avi Sassportaz, 21, who police believe was killed
by Palestinians. After the funeral in the southern port city of
Ashdod, hundreds of Israelis stoned Arab-owned cars.
   In Jerusalem, right-wing demonstrators protesting last week's
slaying of two elderly Israelis by a Palestinian hanged the effigy
of an Arab from a small wooden gallow. ``Death to Arab Murderers,''
said a sign around the neck of the effigy, erected near where the
slayings took place.
   The two dozen protesters called for stronger measures to quell
the uprising.
   ``Send the army to beat them. Chop off their hands ... Place
them up on the gallows and hang them until they are dead,'' said
Gershon Salomon, head of the Temple Mount Faithful, a right-wing
Israeli group.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, said Palestinians who
participate in his proposed elections first must guarantee they
will not later claim they are the government of a Palestinian state.
   He was quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying ``these
principles'' must apply for the whole process of his peace plan.
   Israeli police, meanwhile, had to contend with a pro-Syrian
demonstration by Druse students in the Golan Heights, annexed by
Israel in 1981 after its capture from Syria 14 years earlier.
   Police fired tear gas and arrested 52 people in the Druse
village of Masada after hundreds of students stoned cars, chanted
``Long live Syria!'' and burned an Israeli flag. The Druse are an
offshoot sect of Islam.

   Former President Jimmy Carter walked
into Panama's vote tabulation center with an open mind but stormed
out after he found election officials were cheating, according to
his aide Bob Pastor.
   ``He took every step in the process at face value,'' Pastor said
of Carter on Monday. ``And when he got to the final step and they
were cheating, he said `Stop.'''
   He said that inside the center on Monday, Carter found officials
tabulating counterfeit vote tally sheets to give government
candidate Carlos Duque a victory in Sunday's election.
   Election Tribunal spokesman Boris Moreno said Carter told the
election officials they should resign rather than participate in a
fraud, and the head of the tabulation commission then told Carter
he was a guest and could not pass judgment.
   Carter walked out.
   The Panamanians refused to let him use the official press center
so he held a news conference across the street in a crowded, narrow
lobby at the Marriott Hotel.
   Carter angrily denounced Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of
the Panamanian Defense Forces, as a dictator who was stealing an
election from his own people.
   Carter, who had been granted a visit with Noriega on Saturday,
said he thought the general had fooled himself and sincerely
believed that Duque, his hand-picked candidate, would win in a fair
election.
   He said he would not meet Noriega again unless the general
declared he was prepared to honor the vote.
   Carter didn't expect that and he left Tuesday morning from the
U.S. Southern Command's Howard Air Force Base on a flight to
Washington where he met with President Bush.
   Carter was not in the official U.S. delegation sent by Bush to
Panama to observe the elections but was an observer from the
unofficial Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government. Carter is
the head of the council.

   Thunderstorms returned to the South on Tuesday with hail as big
as golf balls and damaging wind, and thunderstorms spread over
parts of the East.
   Thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front produced large
hail and high wind in northeastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana
during the late morning.
   Hail 2 inches in diameter fell near Atlanta, Texas, and hail as
big as golf balls fell at Mira and Benton, La., the National
Weather Service said. Winds gusting to 62 mph accompanied the hail
at Mira.
   By afternoon, the storms extended into northwestern Mississippi.
   Showers and scattered thunderstorms developing ahead of a warm
front extended from the Carolinas to the Ohio Valley during the
afternoon. Flood watches were posted through the night for western
Maryland, West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, and central Virginia.
   In the West, a cold front crossing the Pacific Coast produced
showers in western Oregon and northwestern California. Showers and
thundershowers were widely scattered over southern and central
California and southern Nevada.
   Drizzle fell in the middle Mississippi Valley and the central
high Plains.
   An apparent tornado tore through the Moseley area of
northeastern Oklahoma near the Arkansas border late Monday, ripping
up country homes, barns, trees and power lines in a four-mile path,
West Siloam Springs police dispatcher Becky Stockton said Tuesday.
No deaths or serious injuries were reported.
   ``One home rolled over on its top and the girl inside was in it
when it rolled, but she came out with just a scratch on her arm,''
said Oklahoma Highway Patrol Capt. Leroy Hendren.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Oscoda and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 100 at Gila Bend,

   Wednesday's forecast called for numerous showers and
thunderstorms in the Carolinas and widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms in most of the rest of the Southeast; showers from
Virginia and eastern Kentucky to the northern Atlantic Coast
states; and scattered showers and thunderstorms across much of the
West, with widely scattered showers and thunderstorms over south
central Texas and the southern High Plains.
   Highs only in the 50s were predicted in the Great Lakes region,
the upper Ohio Valley and the Northeast; in the 50s and 60s from
the Tennessee Valley to the upper Mississippi Valley and the middle
and northern Atlantic Coast states; in the 60s across the Pacific
Northwest and along the California coast; in the 80s from Florida

<HEAD>Bush, Dutch Leaders Discuss European Missiles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Dutch leaders met twice with President Bush on
Tuesday in an effort to find a solution to NATO differences over
short-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush told reporters he set aside an additional hour to discuss
the issue with the delegation led by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers
and that he expected the differences with the West German
government to be cleared up by the time of the NATO summit in three
weeks.
   ``I have a good feeling that there's been a lot of smoke out
there and that we'll have a smooth summit,'' Bush said.
   But, he added, ``I don't believe in deadlines.''
   Bush was asked whether he had had any more telephone
conversations with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the
problem. Kohl opposes modernizing U.S. short-range missiles
stationed in Europe and wants to negotiate with the Soviet Union
for elimination of the weapons.
   ``Oh, I never discuss these _ all these talks I've had,'' Bush
said.
   Kohl was reported to have been irritated that the White House
disclosed that he and Bush discussed their differences in a phone
call on Friday.
   The Bush administration has argued that short-range missiles are
needed in Europe to compensate for an overwhelming superiority in
conventional forces by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Bush said Lubbers was ``a friend of long standing'' and that
they would be able to discuss the issue ``very, very frankly.''
   ``But this alliance is not going to fall apart,'' said Bush.
``It is going to stay together and be strong. And we'll work it
out.''
   Asked whether the United States was willing to compromise, Bush
said, ``It might mean people are willing to do it our way. We're
the United States.''
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said his country had
presented a compromise solution at meetings going on in Brussels at
the headquarters of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. But he declined to say what the Dutch text contained.
   Van den Broek said a possible solution to the rift, which
threatens to disrupt a NATO summit scheduled for May 29, would be
for the allies to ask for unilateral cuts in the Soviet short-range
missile arsenal.
   A West German official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said, however, that Bonn has grave reservations about unilateral
cutbacks because they might not be verifiable and that an agreement
including verification procedures would be preferable.

<HEAD>Armed Robbery Charge Dropped Against `Diff'rent Strokes' Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COMPTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A charge of armed robbery against
``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Todd Bridges was dropped Tuesday after
prosecutors said they had new information on the case, which they
declined to describe.
   Bridges, 23, still faces attempted murder charges for a Feb. 2
shooting at a reputed drug den in south-central Los Angeles in
which the victim survived and later identified his attackers.
Another man also is charged in that case.
   Bridges for eight years played the character Willis Jackson on
``Diff'rent Strokes'' opposite costars Gary Coleman and Conrad Bain.
   In the armed robbery charge, investigators said Bridges took his
BMW from a repair shop at gunpoint Jan. 23 instead of paying a $500
repair bill. The shooting also stemmed from a dispute over the same
car, investigators have said.
   But when Bridges' preliminary hearing was about to begin
Tuesday, Deputy District Attorney Robert Gosney moved to dismiss
the charges.
   ``Some new information came in that cast a serious doubt (on)
whether we had the right man,'' Gosney said.
   He declined to describe the information, and said the robbery
charge may be refiled against Bridges if the new evidence fails to
stand.
   Authorities have said Bridges was one of two men who had taken
the car in for repairs.

   President Bush said Tuesday that Panama's
presidential election was marred by fraud and irregularities and
called on military ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega to ``heed the call
of the people'' and relinquish power.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
considering options ranging from military force to economic
sanctions against Panama.
   But the president said he would not talk about U.S. alternatives
until Panama announces the official results of Sunday's election.
   U.S. officials privately said that an armed invasion was highly
unlikely and that the more probable options would be to strengthen
military forces, impose tougher sanctions or withdraw military
dependents and civilians.
   ``I call on all foreign leaders to urge Gen. Noriega to honor
the clear results of the election,'' Bush said in a hurriedly
called question-and-answer session with reporters in the Oval
Office.
   ``I would like to think that he (Noriega) will heed the call of
the people and that he would listen to the international outcry
that is building and that he would step down from office _ in which
case the relations with the United States would improve
dramatically and instantly,'' Bush said.
   Bush hopes that pressure from other Central American nations and
the apparent success of Noriega's opposition will persuade him to
abandon power, said an administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``We're going to proceed slowly, we're
going to take our time,'' the official said.
   The president commented after meeting with a delegation of
official U.S. observers. In late afternoon, Bush met in the Oval
Office with former President Carter, who led another observer
delegation.
   Afterward, Carter accused Noriega of ``thievery'' and said
election tabulations he examined were ``patently counterfeit.'' He
called Noriega ``amoral.''
   Standing in a light rain in the White House driveway, Carter
cautioned against the use of U.S. military force and said the
United States should not abrogate the Panama Canal treaties, which
were negotiated and signed during his administration.
   ``Any sort of military involvement down there would immediately
alienate the Panamanian people, who respect their nation's
sovereignty as do we,'' Carter said. ``And obviously unilateral
action is much weaker than action in concert with other democratic
countries. I think these are more fruitful.''
   As for abrogating the treaties, Carter said that would ``play
right into the hands of Noriega. It's the kind of thing he would
like to see. ... It would alienate every other nation in this
hemisphere.''
   Carter, who was accompanied by other members of his team, told
Bush that a scientific poll conducted by the Roman Catholic Church
with a maximum margin of error of eight or nine percent said
Noriega had won in only two polling places.
   Bush said the observers' reports ``demonstrate clearly that
despite massive irregularities at the polls the opposition has won
a clear-cut, overwhelming victory.
   ``The Panamanian people have spoken and I call on Gen. Noriega
to respect the voice of the people and I call on all foreign
leaders to urge Gen. Noriega to honor the clear results of the
election,'' Bush said.
   Asked why Noriega might leave power now after ignoring U.S.
demands for a year, Bush said, ``Because there has been a massive
voice of the people heard.
   ``There has been a statement for democracy so loud and so clear
that perhaps even Gen. Noriega will listen to it.''
   Bush praised President Alan Garcia of Peru, ``who has spoken out
against the fraud,'' and said that Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez was encouraging neighboring countries to issue a joint
statement ``against the fraud that is taking place and calling on
Noriega to honor the results of this election.''
   Hinting at recent U.S. contacts with Noriega, Bush said the
Panamanian leader ``knows my position. ... He knows about it
through recent contacts.''
   Fitzwater, told reporters earlier in the day:
   ``Our policy remains that Noriega must go.''
   Fitzwater said that Bush and his national security advisers
``have been considering options that range from the use of military
force to various economic and commercial moves related to a U.S.
presence in that country.''
   The United States has waged a year-long campaign of economic and
diplomatic sanctions to dislodge Noriega but has not been
successful.
   There were these other developments:
   _The official U.S. delegation reported to Bush that, in the
words of its chairman, ``We didn't see any way that it could be a
free and fair election.''
   _Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the Defense Department had
alerted American servicemen stationed in Panama and their
dependents to avoid travel around the country.
   ``We have a very uneasy situation in Panama,'' Howard said.
Fitzwater told reporters that U.S. military personnel in Panama had
been harassed and were on a ``very high state of alert.''
   _The State Department contradicted a Panamanian government
assessment that, based on returns from four of 40 election
districts, Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate, Carlos
Duque, was leading opposition candidate Guillermo Endara by 80,646
votes to 54,437.
   Rather, said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, the
administration believes Panamanians voted by margins of two or
three to one to replace Noriega's regime.
   Fitzwater said American officials were ``convinced that the
opposition candidate had the support and the votes to fairly win
this election and we are just as convinced that the Noriega regime
made every effort, took every opportunity, had every intention of
stealing this election regardless of the actual vote.''
   Members of the official delegation sent by Bush met with him at
the White House and later called the voting a sham.
   ``We told the president that we saw such widespread
irregularities and actual fraud that we didn't see any way that it
could be a free and fair election,'' said Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.,
the delegation's head.
   He said there was ``a sense of urgency'' about the need for
action.
   Another member of the delegation, Sen. Bob. Graham, D-Fla.,
urged Bush to withdraw U.S. military dependents and citizens from
Panama while beefing up the number of combatants among the 10,000
U.S. troops there.
   ``One of the worst things we could do would be to give the
appearance of a forceful action and then collapse when the pressure
got too great,'' Graham said.
   Fitzwater said he did not think an evacuation of dependents was
under way, but added, ``That's not to say there isn't planning
underway that would accommodate a number of movements of one kind
or another.''
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., who was also in the official U.S.
delegation, said military force was ``the last option you'd
consider ...
   ``I don't believe that the first thing we're going to see is
some kind of war-room exercise of people deciding when they're
going to go to the mat with Noriega militarily,'' Smith said.
``It's just not happening.
   Fitzwater hinted that provisions of the 1977 Panama Canal
treaties might be used to intensify pressures against Noriega.
   ``There is no plan to abrogate the canal treaties,'' under which
the United States has agreed to turn the American-built canal over
to Panamanian control on the last day of this century, Fitzwater
said. ``However we do have concerns about how they are carried
out.''
   After Noriega engineered the ouster of President Eric Arturo
Delvalle in February 1988, then-President Reagan froze about $50
million in Panamanian assets in U.S. banks.

<HEAD>Communist Party Chief To Resign On May 17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reformer Stipe Suvar will step aside
as Communist Party chief next week, but he will join the
government's influential nine-member presidency, news reports said
Tuesday.
   He would have been forced to give up his party post next month
anyway, because the party leadership rotates annually. Beginning in
June, the leadership transfers to a party official from the
republic of Macedonia.
   Suvar recently was elected to represent the republic of Croatia
in the nine-man state presidency. News reports said he will be
inaugurated as a member of the presidency on May 15 and resign as
party chief on May 17.
   The seat on the presidency assures Suvar a continued role on the
national political stage, where he is battling his Serbian
political rival, Slobodan Milosevic.
   He is a more authoritarian, orthodox Communist than Suvar,
although both men have backed market-oriented reforms.
   Milosevic was proclaimed Monday as president of the republic of
Serbia, which gives him largely a figurehead role in the largest of
Yugoslavia's six republics. In addition, Milosevic will have to
give up his seat on the national party's ruling Politburo.
   The dispute between Suvar and Milosevic reflects ethnic divides
between the Serbs, the dominant ethnic group in Yugoslavia's
patchwork of nationalities, and the rival Croats and other northern
people.
   Milosevic has bolstered Serbian authority in the province of
Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian majority rioted over his policies
in March. The clashes in the province on the Albanian border left
at least 24 dead.
   Media reports on Tuesday quoted Suvar as saying that ``because
of the political quarrels within the party, tomorrow we could have
brutal clashes'' because of mounting economic and political strife.
   Yugoslavia suffers an annual inflation rate of about 500
percent, which has helped fuel ethnic tensions.
   Serbia's security chief, Dragutin Mitrovic, told Yugoslav
journalists Tuesday that police have stepped up security in Kosovo
after intercepting reports that ethnic Albanians plan sabotage and
assassination attempts on senior Communist officials there and in
neighboring Serbia.
   Mitrovic said ``there exists a latent danger'' of further unrest
by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo ``primarily in the form of acts of
sabotage and assassinations.''
   He said targets of ``hostile Albanian emigres'' include
``leading personalities in Serbia and Kosovo'' but gave no details.
He also did not elaborate on the new security measures.
   Many security forces have already been deployed in Kosovo, and a
state of emergency imposed during the unrest remains in place.
   In a related development, the state Tanjug news agency said 12
people, including eight policeman, were arrested in the republic of
Montenegro and accused of selling stolen firearms to Albanians in
Kosovo.
   The eight policeman reportedly had served in Kosovo.
   The weapons included pistols, semi-automatic rifles and a
machine gun, Tanjug said.

<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC and WJLA-TV, the network's
local station, aired unfair portrayals of blacks while reporting on
Washington's drug problem, Nadine Winter, a member of the city
council, said Tuesday.
   She said in a letter to Capital Cities-ABC President Thomas
Murphy that coverage of the city's drug-related crime wave by the
network and the station represents ``a vicious pattern of seemingly
calculated malicious maligning of the district's black community in
general and young black males in particular.''
   The city's population is 67 percent black. According to police
statistics, 350 of the record 372 people slain in the city in 1988
were black, and through May 2 of this year 149 of the 170 killed
were black.
   Winter, who is black, said repeated broadcasts portraying blacks
as drug dealers and users has hurt employment and job-training
prospects for local blacks.
   ``Basically, we're surprised and disappointed that she would
reach this conclusion,'' said WJLA President Mike Moore.
``Certainly, we'll take the matter seriously and discuss it
internally and with the network.''
   Copies of the letter were sent to Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Dennis
Patrick. Murphy, Thornburgh and Patrick could not be immediately
reached for comment.
   ABC's ``Nightline'' recently aired a program on city crime,
titled ``D.C.: Divided City.'' It included film footage of black
homicide victims, black teen-agers being arrested on drug charges
and black youths allegedly selling drugs.
   The show also included a film prepared by three black high
school students that showed whites in the Georgetown section
reacting with fear when asked for change or directions by the
students.
   A segment of the program included statements by crime experts
who said whites make up a majority of the nation's drug users.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers all over China grumble about their
miserable pay, but those in Henan province also are subjected to
physical violence.
   The Guangming Daily, the national newspaper for intellectuals,
reported about the violence against in a front-page article Tuesday
with the headline ``The Disgrace of the Cradle of Civilization.''
   ``A section of cadres and the masses look down on learning, and
their concept of despising education has not fundamentally
changed,'' it said.
   Intellectuals, once considered the elite in China, have had low
social status since the Communists came to power 40 years ago.
During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, they were called ``the
stinking ninth class.''
   From the beginning of 1988 through April 1989, there were 156
incidents of teachers being beaten or otherwise injured or
humiliated in Henan, the paper reported. It said three of the
teachers died and 13 suffered serious injuries.
   Among those attacked was Zhang Xipei, a high school principal
who tried in February 1988 to expel a girl who insisted on carrying
a dagger to school, it said.
   Her uncle went to Zhang's house with a group of men and egged
them on with with shouts of ``Ruthlessly attack _ 500 yuan for
breaking a leg, 1,000 yuan for gouging out an eye!'' the Guangming
Daily reported. The top reward of 1,000 yuan is about $270.
   Zhang and his daughter were seriously injured.
   Although the government says it is committed to improving the
living standard of teachers, their pay typically is only half that
of factory workers.
   Violence is nothing new to teachers in Henan. In 1987, the China
Education Newspaper reported more than 200 cases of teachers being
beaten.

   In the bloodiest confrontation, soldiers attacked a New People's

<HEAD>Report Confirms Deficit in Medicare Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report delivered to Congress on
Tuesday confirms earlier projections the prescription drug program
under the new Medicare catastrophic care program will run about $3
billion short by 1993.
   The report by the Department of Health and Human Services
projects that over the first four years of the program, benefit
payments will exceed premium revenues by nearly $1 billion, or $3
billion, including administrative costs.
   New benefits under the program will expand coverage of
prescription drugs received outside of the hospital beginning Jan.
1, 1991. The program includes a schedule of co-payments by
beneficiaries.
   The drug benefits will be financed partly by an increase in the
monthly flat-rate premium paid by those eligible for Medicare,
which rose to $4 this year and is scheduled to go up to $4.90 in
1990 and $7.40 in 1991.
   Money for the benefits also come from a surtax on income taxes
of on Medicare beneficiaries. The maximum surtax on any person is
$800 this year, or $1,600 for a couple if both spouses are eligible.
   A Congressional Budget Office report recently estimated that
these revenues would bring $4.9 billion more than is needed to fund
the catastrophic illness benefits and build up a reserve.
   The report prompted Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to suggest that
premiums for the new program could be cut. President Bush, however,
opposed the idea, saying the surplus might be needed because of
projections that the expanded drug benefits are underfunded.

<HEAD>SEC Study Says Computer Traders Had Effect Before October Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study Tuesday by a Securities and
Exchange Commission economist found that computerized trading
strategies influenced stock prices in the days leading up to the
Oct. 19, 1987, crash but not on the day of the crash.
   The study, prepared by SEC economist Dean Furbush and by custom
not adopted as a formal position by the commission, is the latest
contribution to what has been a hotly debated point.
   Those who advocate combining the regulation of stock and stock
index futures markets under one agency have maintained that
lightening-fast trading of huge quantities of stocks and futures
contracts contributed to the record 508-point plunge in the Dow
Jones average of industrial stocks.
   Although separate federal agencies continue to regulate stock
and futures markets, the exchanges have agreed among themselves to
suspend trading across markets when prices plunge in one of the
markets.
   A presidential task force headed by Nicholas F. Brady, now
Treasury secretary, found last year that just a few institutional
investors using a computer-trading strategy known as portfolio
insurance ``played a dominant role'' during the stock crash.
   The SEC in an earlier study said program trading, while not
causing the crash, made it faster and worse than it would have been.
   However, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which fought
a successful turf war to maintain its power over the trading of
stock futures contracts, found in its study that program trading
``does not appear to have played a major role in the crash.''
   Furbush, who examined the relationship of stock and futures
trading at five-minute intervals from Oct. 14 to Oct. 20, partly
backs that view, finding ``greater price declines were not found to
occur systematically during times of more intensive program
trading'' on Oct. 19.
   However, he said, ``the volume of ... program trading (was)
related to (stock price) changes ... on Oct. 14, 15 and 16.''
   Furbush said by Oct. 19 the relationship between the stock and
futures markets was breaking down and on Oct. 20, when the New York
Stock Exchange had suspended use of its computerized trading
system, the volume of program trading declined dramatically.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Claims Vietnamese Still Fighting Near Thai Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese troops have not withdrawn
from areas near the Cambodian-Thai border and are still shelling
refugee camps there, according to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, during a recent
visit to Bangkok, said Vietnam had pulled its troops back to points
at least 19 miles from the border. Vietnam has said it began the
withdrawal from the border zone in late 1987 as a peace gesture to
Thailand.
   The Khmer Rouge, the largest Cambodian guerrilla force, said in
a broadcast that the Vietnamese statements were false.
   A text of Sunday's broadcast was obtained in Bangkok on Tuesday.
It said:
   ``When Nguyen Co Thach released that statement, the Cambodian
resistance forces and the Vietnamese aggressor troops were fighting
vigorously and fiercely along the border.
   ``The Hanoi troops stationed along the border fired thousands of
artillery shells into Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand, killing
and wounding a number of residents.
   ``At times Vietnamese soldiers even intruded into Thai
territory, such as in the Pailin area.'' There was no independent
confirmation of the Khmer Rouge claims.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the radical
Khmer Rouge that had ruled the country since the spring of 1975 and
set up another communist government.
   The Khmer Rouge came to power by defeating the U.S.-backed
Cambodian government. During its brief rule up to 2 million
Cambodians were killed in purges or died of starvation.
   After the Vietnamese action the Khmer Rouge reverted to
guerrilla warfare and subsequently formed a fractious resistance
coalition with supporters of Prince Norodom Sihanounk and
anti-communist forces of former Premier Son Sann.
   Another Khmer Rouge broadcast Sunday repeated the rejection of
recent peace proposals and a cease-fire.
   The broadcast said, ``What the Vietnamese have done is only to
change their appearance with the aim of fooling international
opinion, but their administrative and military networks remain the
same from top to bottom in Cambodia.''
   At a meeting last week in Indonesia, Sihanouk and Cambodian
Premier Hun Sen agreed to a Thai proposal that the Cambodian
factions observe a cease-fire before the complete withdrawal of the
Vietnamese from Cambodia.
   Vietnam, with up to 70,000 soldiers in Cambodia, has pledged to
remove all of its military forces by Sept. 30.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said Monday a cease-fire could
only be part of an overall solution.
   ``We cannot accept a cease-fire that keeps in place a puppet
regime,'' he said of the Hun Sen government.
   Hun Sen has ruled out Khmer Rouge participation in any
provisional government.

<HEAD>Air Force To Continue Hurricane Hunters For Two Years</HEAD>

   The Air Force agreed Tuesday to maintain its
fleet of ``hurricane hunters'' for the next two years, reversing
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plans to scrap weather
reconnaissance flights in the midst of the hurricane season,
lawmakers said.
   ``It's a good resolution of the problem,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said late Tuesday after a group of coastal states
lawmakers met with acting Air Force Secretary Jack Welch and other
officials of the Pentagon and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   NOAA and the Air Force will attempt to work out an agreement
over the next two years on which agency would eventually man the
planes that fly into the eye of a hurricane, lawmakers said.
   It has been suggested the hurricane hunters become the
responsibility of NOAA, but Bentsen and others contend the agency
would be unable to take over the program on such quick notice.
   Cheney said the flights, used to predict the intensity and
position of an approaching hurricane, were not a defense mission
and sought to save at least $14 million annually by slashing the
program.
   But lawmakers complained that phasing it out this summer would
leave hurricane-prone regions dangerously exposed.
   Rep. Greg Laughlin, D-Texas, said keeping the hurricane hunters
``is to the American citizens' benefit so they know whether the
hurricane has the intensity to require an evacuation.''
   The Pentagon officials told the group the Air Force decided to
eliminate the program because ``they thought they had an agreement
with NOAA'' for it to assume responsibility for the hurricane
hunters, ``and there was no agreement,'' Laughlin said after the
closed-door session.
   Rep. Tom Lewis, R-Fla., said ``we feel there's no way peacetime
dollars can be better spent.''
   Cheney had recommended the Air Force halt the reconnaissance
flights by Oct. 1, when the new fiscal year begins.
   In testimony before a House committee last week, National
Hurricane Center Director Robert C. Sheets said the aircraft ``are
the only means of making direct measurements of location, strength
and windfield distributions critical to the hurricane forecast and
warning process.''

<HEAD>Cold Fusion Researchers Concede Measurement Errors</HEAD>

   Two chemists went before 1,800 colleagues to
bolster their claim of achieving nuclear fusion at room
temperature, but failed to sway doubters and admitted problems
plague some of their measurements.
   ``I think they're clearly on the ropes at this point,''
physicist Steven Koonin of the California Institute of Technology
in Pasadena said Tuesday after the presentation by Martin
Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons.
   However, Koonin said the possible achievement of
room-temperature fusion in an experiment by Pons and Fleischmann's
scientific rival, Steven Jones of Brigham Young University, ``is
looking pretty good and there may be some real physics there.''
   There is growing evidence indicating that experiments conducted
by Jones may have created room-temperature fusion, ``but not enough
to heat anything,'' Koonin said.
   Pons, of the University of Utah, and Fleischmann, of England's
Southampton University, announced March 23 that they had created
nuclear fusion in a flask.
   Such an accomplishment, if confirmed, could lead to a cheap,
virtually inexhaustible source of energy.
   However, Pons and Fleischmann are facing a growing number of
critics who have attacked their experimental measurements and
conclusions.
   Their appearance Monday night at the Electrochemical Society
Inc.'s meeting at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel had been billed as
the pair's opportunity to present new evidence to substantiate
their claims.
   Instead, Pons and Fleischmann acknowledged they may have made
errors in their measurements of neutrons and gamma radiation during
their experiments at the University of Utah.
   ``We are well aware those measurements are deficient,''
Fleischmann said.
   He and Pons also said their most recent experiments yielded 10
to 50 times more energy than was consumed to operate their fusion
device. In their March announcement, they said they had produced
four times more energy.
   Unlike fission, which generates energy by splitting the atom,
fusion generates tremendous energy by fusing two atoms together. It
is the process occurring in the sun and hydrogen bombs.
   Most efforts to achieve fusion have focused on forcing atoms
together by brute force, using multimillion-dollar machines
operating at extremely high temperature and pressure.
   But Pons and Fleischmann claimed they created fusion by finesse,
using relatively simple laboratory equipment to coax hydrogen atoms
to fuse in a low-level electric field.
   Their apparatus sent an electrical current through an electrode
made of palladium and wrapped with platinum while immersed in heavy
water, which is made with a form of hydrogen called deuterium.
   Koonin said that while Jones' experiments measured atoms fusing
at a rate of about one per second, the heat described by Pons and
Fleischmann would require a fusion rate of about one-hundred
trillion fusions per second.
   Experimental findings presented at the meeting, particularly by
researchers at Texas A&amp;M University, tend to ``confirm Jones, but
they wouldn't confirm Pons and Fleischmann,'' Koonin said.
   ``Something real is happening here,'' said Robert Huggins of
Stanford University, noting that he got 40 percent more heat from
his experiment than he put into it.
   Several other scientists at the meeting said they successfully
produced excess heat or other signs of fusion, such as neutrons,
but stopped short of saying their studies proved fusion had
happened.
   Many major laboratories have been unable to duplicate Pons and
Fleischmann's results.
   ``There is no fusion,'' one of their most vocal critics, Caltech
chemist Nathan Lewis, said at Monday's meeting.
   He disputed claims by Pons and Fleischmann that their device
produced excess heat, or that it yielded byproducts of fusion,
including helium, tritium, neutrons and gamma rays.
   Fleischmann and Pons disputed Lewis and other critics who
accused them of sloppiness in their measurements, and Pons said
scientists unable to duplicate their experiments failed to use
large enough palladium electrodes.
   But, Fleischmann added, ``I have always been ready to
acknowledge the fact our experiments could be faulty. If we turn
out to be wrong, I'll be the first to admit it.''
   He acknowledged that evidence of gamma radiation was the ``least
satisfactory'' part of their research. ``We are doing a complete
new set of measurements with improved techniques,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, they maintained their experiments generated excess
heat.

   Producers and distributors of counterfeit
money will be sentenced to death under a law that will go into
effect next month, state-run Tehran radio reported Tuesday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said Economic and Financial
Affairs Minister Mohammad Javad Iravani announced the planned
legislation at a news conference.
   It quoted him as saying, ``Counterfeiters of legal tender, or
those involved in counterfeiting, distributing or using counterfeit
tender with knowledge of its lack of authenticity will be sentenced
to death.''
   He also said anyone importing counterfeit currency into Iran or
knowing of such action would face execution.
   Five months ago, Iran's fundamentalist Islamic government
decreed the death penalty for possession of illegal drugs. Official
announcements have reported 558 executions since that law took
effect.
   Iranian opposition groups contend the capital punishment laws
are being used to eliminate political opponents of Iran's
revolutionary patriarch, leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

   The U.S. government's spokesman in Havana smuggled
Cuban art into this country in a scheme partly intended to benefit
members of the Caribbean nation's government, a federal
prosecutor's spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   No arrests have been made and the investigation is continuing,
but Cuban paintings and records have been seized from an art dealer
here, said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen.
   A U.S. Customs Service affidavit said Jerry W. Scott, the
spokesman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, brought the
paintings into this country in violation of the Cuban trade embargo.
   ``We have a lot of documents, records and other evidence to go
over,'' Ms. Cossin said. ``It's not over yet by any means.''
   The U.S. Information Agency, for which Scott worked in Havana as
the section's media spokesman, praised Scott's job performance.
   ``He's got a good record,'' said spokesman William Reinckens.
   Reinckens said no disciplinary action was planned. He said he
could not discuss the merits of the case against Scott, who now
works in Washington.
   In Washington, the State Department refused to comment and
referred calls back to Customs.
   The paintings were seized Friday from Ramon Cernuda, owner of
the Editorial Cernuda art gallery in Miami, after an affidavit
sworn by Customs Agent Peter D. Liston was submitted to a federal
magistrate.
   Cernuda has said the investigation is prompted by his opposition
to the powerful Cuban American National Foundation, a powerful,
militantly anti-Castro lobbying group.
   Customs began its investigation following publicity about an
April 1988 auction at the Cuban Museum of Art and Culture in Miami
which allegedly involved Cernuda-owned Cuban paintings, Liston said
in the affidavit.
   ``Cuban art is being smuggled into the United States for
personal gain and allegedly to profit members of the Cuban
government,'' Liston said.
   Liston said that by bidding prices up at art auctions and
private sales, Cuba's government, which holds the largest amount of
Cuban artwork, ``realizes the greater economic benefits.''
   The affidavit did not distinguish between members of the Cuban
government or the government. Officials would not comment Tuesday
on that, saying the investigation is continuing.
   The probe determined that some paintings had made their way to
Cernuda from Scott.
   The United States has no formal relations with Cuba, but
maintains the Interests Section to handle such things as visas and
routine legal transactions.
   Liston said that in February 1988 Scott brought 40 paintings
into Miami International Airport, and failed to declare to Customs
inspectors that he was bringing Cuban art into this country in
violation of regulations.
   The Cuban provision of the Trading With The Enemy Act prohibits
virtually all commerce with Cuba after 1963, the agent said.
   Scott acknowledged to Liston last April 28 that he had handed
the paintings over to Cernuda, the agent said. Scott then called
Cernuda, who confirmed he still had the artworks.
   Cernuda also bought paintings from Guido Adriaenssens, who
smuggled about 100 paintings into the United States, the affidavit
alleged.
   ``This is absurd,'' said Cernuda's attorney, Ted Klein. ``The
U.S. attorney should hang his head in shame for attempting to seize
artwork, which is basically intellectual property that is no
different than books or records or motion pictures or magazines.''
   Anyone convicted of trading with the enemy could be sentenced to
up to 10 years in prison and fined $250,000 for each violation, the
U.S. attorney's office said.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers loyal to the 3-year-old civilian
government on Tuesday snuffed out the second attempted military
coup in a year without firing a shot.
   President Vinicio Cerezo asked Guatemalans to remain calm,
saying, ``The situation is under the control of the government and
the army of Guatemala.''
   The capital was calm by midafternoon with tanks and soldiers off
the streets and business back to normal.
   Defense Minister Alejandro Gramajo said rebel air force troops
backed by two helicopter gunships and an A-37 warplane blocked two
major highways on the south and northeast edges of the capital.
Gramajo said rebel troops also tried to march on his home.
   He said the rebels turned back when they encountered a superior
force of loyalist troops.
   The defense chief said at least 300 rebel soldiers were
involved. He gave no other troop figures.
   The rebellion was crushed without a shot being fired, Cerezo
told a news conference hours after the uprising.
   Cerezo and Gramajo said the attempt was staged by an air force
tactical unit based at the international airort south of Guatemala
City. It was led by at least 10 current, retired or cashiered
military officers, including several who took part in a failed
uprising on May 11, 1988, they reported.
   In that attempt, two columns of troops marched on Guatemala City
but were turned back without gunfire. Six officers were arrested.
   Gramajo said two colonels, a captain and a major cashiered for
taking part in last year's attempt were involved in Tuesday's
rebellion.
   ``The officers ... came up with this way of celebrating last
year's coup attempt and keeping the movement alive,'' he said.
   Cerezo and Gramajo said all but two high-ranking officers
involved in Tuesday's plot were in custody. An unspecified number
of soldiers were also arrested.
   The president said civilians apparently were not involved, as
they were last year.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
voiced strong, continued U.S. support for the government.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he received reports the real target may have been Gramajo or
another minister. Gramajo repeatedly has said the time has come for
real civilian government in Guatemala.
   Guatemala never has sustained a modern democratic govenment. It
is widely agreed civilian authority now exists only with military
consent and supervision.
   Gramajo said loyalist troops, tanks and artillery took up
defensive positions at strategic sites after the plot surfaced at
about 5 a.m.
   Loyalist troops identified themselves by wearing blue kerchiefs
at their necks. Most of them returned to barracks by 8:30 a.m.
after the rebel aircraft returned to base.
   Cerezo said rebels tried to seize radio and TV to broadcast a
communique. He refused to divulge the contents, saying it would be
used as evidence in military tribunal proceedings.
   Gramajo told The Associated Press in August, ``The army is doing
everything possible so that the era of coups pertains to the past.
Nonetheless, the traditional forces are doing everything possible
so that it does not. As of now, I'm winning.''
   The ``traditional forces'' are rightist landowners and business
people who forged strong alliances with the military during years
of military rule.
   Cerezo, 46, a Christian Democrat, took office in January 1986,
heading the first elected civilian administration in 16 years. His
term ends in 1991.
   The right wing attacked him for his economic policy,
particularly on tax reform, and for trying to open talks with
leftists who have waged guerrilla war for 30 years.
   On April 16, Cerezo blamed rightist paramilitary groups for a
growing wave of violence.
   The international community widely shunned Guatemala because of
human rights abuses during military rule here.
   The armed forces and death squads linked to the military were
blamed for killing tens of thousands of people, many of them
Indians who make up more than half of Guatemala's 8.5 million
people. The army denies it.
   The Central American nation, about the size of Tennessee, is
bounded on the north and west by Mexico, the south by the Pacific
Ocean and the east by El Salvador, Honduras and Belize.
   Guatemala refuses to say how big its standing army is, but the
International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated total
combined security and defense forces at 52,000 at the end of 1987.

   Police arrested an eighth member of a satanic
cult of drug smugglers blamed for the ritual slaying of 15 people
near the U.S. border, law enforcement officials said Tuesday.
   Octavio Campos, spokesman for the Mexico City attorney general's
office, identified the suspect only as Enrique Calzada. He was
picked up by police Monday evening in Mexico City, Campos said.
   Campos said Calzada was ``the boyfriend of one of the women ring
members nicknamed `Carla.'''
   ``Carla'' is the nickname of Maria del Rocio Cuevas Guerra, 43,
who along with four other people was arrested at a Mexico City
apartment Saturday after a gun battle with police.
   Police refused to disclose the identities of two other women
arrested late Monday, saying they were being questioned and that
their depositions had not been completed.
   An official at the attorney general's office, who insisted on
anonymity, said police sought ``several more'' suspects for
questioning in connection with the satanic cult slayings at a ranch
outside Matamoros, Mexico.
   Police on Saturday also arrested Sara Aldrete Villarreal, 29,
who authorities described as the cult's ``godmother''; Omar
Francisco Orea, 23, a journalism student at the National
University; Dr. Maria de Lourdes Guero Lopez, 29, a physician; and
Alvaro de Leon Valdez, 22.
   The cult's ``godfather,'' Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, and a
henchman were killed by fellow cult members on Constanzo's orders
at the fourth-floor apartment a few blocks from the U.S. and
British embassies.
   The eight suspects being held have been booked on charges of
homicide, criminal association, wounding a police agent during the
arrest, and property damage. Campos said their arraingment was to
take place late Tuesday and had been delayed because of paperwork
associated with the depositions.
   Authorities told a tale of bizarre rituals, human and animal
sacrifices and the boiling of brains and other organs by the cult.
   They said Constanzo, 26, and Ms. Aldrete, a former honor student
at Texas Southmost College in Brownsville, Texas, directed the
sacrifices. But Ms. Aldrete denied involvement in the killings
during two appearences before reporters this week.
   Cult members said they were convinced the rituals would protect
them from police while they smuggled marijuana into the United
States.
   Hundreds of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement agents had searched
for the couple since April 11, when Mexican police discovered the
buried bodies of the 15 victims at the remote ranch near Matamoros.
   The arrested cult members told officials that Constanzo,
convinced police were closing in on him, began throwing handfuls of
$50 and $100 bills out of the apartment window and took potshots at
passersby who stopped to pick them up.
   Constanzo then ordered de Leon Valdez to kill him and his
henchman, Martin Quintana Rodriguez. De Leon Valdez said Constanzo
slapped him when he hesitated at first. He killed them both with a
burst of automatic weapon fire and stuffed their bodies in a closet.

   Members of an aerobics class got to
exercise their political clout when they happened on a town meeting
in need of voters.
   The three selectmen, the town moderator, the town clerk and the
administrative assistant all gathered in the Oakham Center School
gym in this central Massachusetts city Monday evening.
   But no residents showed up because it had been previously
announced that the annual session would be postponed until late
June, when state aid figures are expected to be available.
   The problem was that residents had to vote to postpone the
meeting.
   The dilemma was solved when a group of women in leotards walked
in for their class. Town Clerk Abby Dolson polled them and found a
sufficient number of registered voters.
   The postponement was unanimously approved and the voters got on
with their exercises.

<TEXT>
   The House voted easy approval Tuesday of a
bill bankrolling vocational education programs, but only after
adding an amendment permitting voluntary prayer in the schools.
   The bill, passed 402-3, provides $1.4 billion for combined
academic and vocational education.
   It provides money to states and to local school districts based
on a complicated formula which gives advantages to disadvantaged
and handicapped students.
   Before passing the bill, the House voted 269-135 approval of an
amendment by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., denying any
money to programs which have ``a policy of denying or which
effectively prevents participation in prayer in public schools by
individuals on a voluntary basis'' would be denied funds. That
amendment passed by a 269-135 vote, with 31 members not voting.
   ``It was just an opportunity. It was a last-minute thing. It
caught everybody by surprise,'' said Paul Mero, a spokesman for
Dannemeyer.
   Mero said the amendment is a prelude to a proposed
constitutional amendment for voluntary school prayer which he said
Dannemeyer will soon offer.
   The bill makes some changes in the way the money would be
administered. For example, it eliminates most of the specific
categories, known as set-asides.
   A compromise ``hold harmless'' amendment addressed concerns
expressed by some members that no school district be drastically
cut or get an unexpected windfall in the new funding formula.
   That formula provides an increase from the current 32 percent to
80 percent of federal money is passed through from the state level
to local school districts, community colleges and area schools.
   The amendment, offered by Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., would
phase in the new formula over three years with no school district
being allocated less than 80 percent of what it received in the
preceding fiscal year.
   The Senate also has passed legislation reauthorizing federal
funding for vocational education.
   Both measures now go to a conference committee where one
education committee staffer predicted the voluntary prayer
provision would be dropped.

   Former Vice President Dario Echandia
Olaya, a senior statesman who served as president four times, has
died. He was 91.
   Echandia died Sunday at Tolima Hospital in Ibague, the capital
of Tolima state in central Colombia, the hospital announced. He had
suffered for nearly two years from heart and lung problems, it said.
   In 1938, Echandia was defeated in a presidential election by
Eduardo Santos.
   He was never elected president by popular vote. However, he
served as vice president and four times took over briefly as a
caretaker president.
   On one of those occasions, Echandia served as president from
October 1943 to May 1944 while President Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo
traveled abroad in search of a cure for his ailing wife.
   During his career, Echandia also served as president of the
congress, president of the supreme court, as well as minister of
foreign affairs, the interior, justice, and education.
   He was also president of the Liberal Party, the country's
leading party.
   Echandia was buried Monday in Ibague. No information was

<TEXT>
   The governing party's presidential
candidate gained a firm lead Tuesday in congressional support and
was favored to be elected by Congress in August.
   None of the nine presidential candidates received a majority in
Sunday's national elections. Under the electoral law, the new
Congress will convene Aug. 4 and elect the winner from the three
top vote-getters.
   They are Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the governing
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement; former military dictator Gen.
Hugo Banzer of the center-right Nationalist Democratic Action; and
Jaime Paz Zamora, candidate of the Social Democratic Movement of
the Revolutionary Left.
   Congressional elections also were held Sunday for all 27 Senate
and 130 House of Deputies seats, which will be divided among the
parties according to the number of votes they received in each
province.
   Unofficial results with 70 percent of the ballots counted gave
Sanchez de Lozada's conservative party 11 Senate seats and 38 House
of Deputies seats for a total of 49, Banzer 7 and 37 for 44 and Paz
Zamora 7 and 32 for 39.
   Most of the ballots still to be tabulated are from remote areas
where Sanchez de Lozada's party was reported running about 6
percent ahead of Banzer's. The election commission will issue its
official final results May 28.
   Both Banzer and Sanchez de Lozada, who were also running
neck-and-neck in the popular vote for president, claimed victory.
   The president selected by Congress will take office for a
four-year term, and the three contenders now must try to strike
political bargains to win.
   In the first round in Congress, any one of the three could be
elected president. In the second round, Congress will decide
between the two who won the most votes in the first round.
   Political observers said Sanchez de Lozada is in a position to
negotiate with either Banzer or Paz Zamora for their support. They
said Banzer might try to form an alliance with Paz Zamora to beat
Sanchez de Lozada, but such an alliance is unlikely.
   They noted many left-wing members of Paz Zamora's party were
jailed, killed or exiled while Banzer was president from 1971-78.

   A gunman who went on a rampage at an
elementary school last fall, killing two children and wounding nine
other people, was sentenced Tuesday to the electric chair.
   James W. Wilson, 20, showed no emotion during the sentencing by
Circuit Judge James Moore. Asked earlier if he had a statement to
make, Wilson replied, ``I have nothing to say.''
   Wilson pleaded guilty but mentally ill last month to two counts
of murder and other charges stemming from the Sept. 26 shooting at
the Oakland Elementary School.
   Wilson walked into the northwestern South Carolina school and
sprayed the cafeteria and a classroom with gunfire, killing
classmates Shequila Bradley and Tequila Thomas, both 8, and
wounding seven students and two teachers.
   The sentence brought sighs of relief from relatives of the
victims.
   ``I'm happy. I'm satisfied,'' said a tearful Linda Davis, whose
8-year-old son, Joseph, was among the wounded.
   Wilson's father, James, said he was disappointed in the
sentence, noting that his son has suffered from mental illness
since he was 14.
   Psychiatrists who examined Wilson testified during his
competency hearing last month that he had a borderline personality
disorder, an illness bordering on schizophrenia.
   Defense attorneys had asked for a life sentence with psychiatric
treatment for their client. Prosecutors sought the death penalty.
   State Chief Deputy Attorney General Donald Zelenka said the
judge clearly found that Wilson knew what he was doing at the time
of the rampage.
   Moore also sentenced Wilson to 175 years in prison on nine
counts of assault and battery and one count of carrying a gun into
a school.
   All death penalty cases in South Carolina are automatically
appealed.

<HEAD>`Eleemosynary,' A Play by Lee Blessing, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Eleemosynary'' means ``charitable'' but it's
also the pretentious title of a not quite successful
three-character drama by Lee Blessing, author of ``A Walk in the
Woods.''
   The play, which opened off-Broadway on Tuesday at Manhattan
Theater Club's Stage II, is about uneasy relationships, something
Blessing also focused on in ``A Walk in the Woods.'' Instead of
dealing with Soviet-American arms control negotiators,
``Eleemosynary'' looks at three generations of women, all of them
desperate overachievers.
   The most interesting and most eccentric is the grandmother
Dorothea, played by Eileen Heckart, an actress too long absent from
the New York stage.
   Dorothea compensates for her unfulfilled marriage by
relentlessly celebrating the bizarre _ fortune-tellers, out-of-body
experiences, trying to teach her infant granddaughter Latin and
Greek, or telling her daughter she can really fly if she'll only
jump off a water tower while she films the flight. Miss Heckart
revels in the character's strangeness.
   Dorothea's forcefulness smothers daughter Artie (Joanna Gleason)
who eventually distances herself from her mother as well as her own
daughter, Echo (Jennie Moreau). Artie eventually flees from both of
them, finding refuge in a research job abroad.
   She can only communicate with her daughter by phone, and then
it's only to quiz her in spelling rather than talk about anything
personal.
   All of this background is told by Blessing in what amounts to
cross-cut monologues. There is minimal interaction between the
three women, with most of their speeches directed to the audience.
The play, compressed into one long act, is episodic and not
necessarily chronological or even dramatically compelling.
   ``Eleemosynary'' hinges on a national spelling bee which the
teen-age Echo enters with a vengeance. Both mother and grandmother
are alarmed at the girl's vicious competitiveness as she battles
her way to the championship. The championship match is the play's
best scene, and Miss Moreau projects the scary single-mindedness of
a true believer.
   Miss Gleason has the drama's most unappealing role, a mother
always running from her family or any kind of emotional commitment.
She manages to make Artie's plight sympathetic even if the
character isn't.
   The women are constantly at war with each other, and their
battles eventually grow tiresome especially when presented in
snippets of scenes that don't allow the action to build. Director
Lynn Meadow has almost choreographed the drama with the ladies
running in and out of the nearly bare playing area all the time.
   The playwright resists sentimentality until the end of the
evening when he stretches for a hopeful, if not a happy, ending.
``Eleemosynary'' is graced by three exceptional actresses who do
their best to find the drama and humor in Blessing's uneven play.

   A 2-year-old boy born without ribs on his
right side is the first person to be given expandable titanium ribs
designed by a Texas doctor that will help him live a normal life,
doctors said Tuesday.
   Christopher Cardenas was on a respirator for his first seven
months until pins and a plastic sheath were implanted to keep his
organs in place. The specially designed ribs were implanted last
month.
   Dr. Robert Campbell, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Santa
Rosa Children's Hospital who developed the expandable rib, led a
three-member team during the six-hour operation April 13.
   Two expandable ribs were inserted vertically and can be expanded
with minor surgery when the boy begins to grow, Campbell said. He
said two were sufficient.
   ``We hope he will be absolutely normal. He is running, playing
and falling down with the rest of the children,'' Campbell said at
a news conference.
   Doctors waited nearly a month to make the announcement so they
could monitor the child's progress, said hospital spokeswoman
Terrie Carter.
   Christopher was born with virtually no ribs or muscles on his
right side and part of his spine also was missing. There were small
ribs at the neck and the waist, but seven ribs in the middle of his
chest were missing.
   For his first seven months, Christopher was on a respirator. His
parents, Gus and Monica Cardenas, went to doctors at Santa Rosa
Children's Hospital in August 1987.
   The baby's organs were shifting and causing the spine to curve,
so Campbell and Dr. Melvin Smith, a pediatric surgeon, implanted
two 3-inch-long vertical pins and a plastic sheath to hold
Christopher's organs in place.
   Campbell said he knew a replacement would have to be inserted,
so he began designing a new implant.
   It cost about $20,000 to develop the ribs, said Dave Martinez,
an engineer with Techmedica Inc., a Camarillo, Calif.-based
artificial joint firm that worked with Campbell.
   Campbell said the couple's insurance would pay for the device.
   The expandable ribs were attached to the small ribs at the neck
and waist, said Campbell.
   Resembling expandable wrist watch bands, the ribs can be
extended when needed as Christopher grows and then locked in
position.
   Campbell said titanium is stronger than steel and the ribs will
be totally safe.
   ``The primary design factor was safety,'' he said. ``I have five
kids myself and I knew they fall, so I designed this for maximum
safety and combat conditions.''
   Christopher, who attended the news conference with his mother,
appeared shy at first but was running around the room by the end of
the session.
   Mrs. Cardenas said she and her husband had gone to doctors in
San Antonio, Austin and Houston and were told that a respirator
would be part of her son's life.
   Then they talked to the Santa Rosa physicians. ``When we ran
into these guys, we were very grateful because all hope was about
gone,'' Mrs. Cardenas said.
   She said her son is ``a pretty typical 2-year-old. He's afraid
of doctors and hospitals.''
   Campbell said he has been contacted by other physicians who have
patients with similar rib difficulties, but did not know when he
would perform more implants.

   The mother of an infant whose death was
linked to cocaine abuse during pregnancy has been charged with
involuntary manslaughter, and the prosecutor defended his action
Tuesday against growing criticism.
   ``The actions of this office reflect the concern, sometimes the
outrage, of this community that children are born ... at risk, both
at birth and for many years,'' said Winnebago County State's
Attorney Paul Logli.
   But medical and social services officials said the charge could
backfire and prevent cocaine-abusing mothers-to-be from seeking
help.
   ``It's the incorrect approach. You want to develop an atmosphere
where they know they can come into the health-care system and not
be penalized. A punitive approach is not going to benefit the
children,'' said Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff at Northwestern University
Medical School, who has directed studies on the effects of prenatal
cocaine use.
   ``If the procedure becomes common enough, it could very well
drive these cocaine-abusing mothers underground,'' said spokesman
Dave Schneidman of the state Department of Children and Family
Services. He noted that the state had 1,233 cocaine babies in 1988,
90 percent of of them in Cook County, which includes Chicago.
   Logli said there had been 27 cocaine-exposed infants since last
summer in Rockford, Illinois' second-largest city with about
150,000 people. That is up from nine the previous year.
   He filed the involuntary manslaughter charge Monday against
Melanie Green, 24, later released on $3,500 bond. An autopsy found
that her baby, Bianca, died two days after birth Feb. 2 of oxygen
deprivation linked to cocaine exposure late in the pregnancy.
   Ms. Green, who does not yet have an attorney, also was charged
with delivery of a controlled substance to a minor, Logli said.
   Involuntary manslaughter is a felony punishible by two to five
years in prison. The prosecutor said Ms. Green could face a 14-year
maximum penalty if she is convicted of the drug charge. Arraignment
is scheduled May 31, Logli said.
   ``Laws that threaten or actually punish women for actions ...
during their pregnancy are contrary both to the Constitution and
common sense,'' said Lynn Paltrow with the American Civil Liberties
Union's division of reproductive rights in New York.
   ``If our society is really concerned about prenatal health care
... the last thing they want to do is terrify women away'' from
proper care.
   But Logli defended his action.
   ``My job as a prosecutor is simply to charge those events where
violation of the law works toward the harm of others,'' Logli said.
``If it spurs some debate in society (that leads to) improving
prenatal care, then it will come to good effect.''
   It's the second time this month that a woman in this city has
been taken to court for exposing her fetus to cocaine, which can
cause numerous health problems including low birth weight, impaired
motor ability, irritability that can hinder learning, strokes and
seizures.
   On May 1, a judge convicted a juvenile mother of child abuse and
neglect for such exposure. The child, who shows no ill effects at 3
months, was temporarily removed from its mother's custody.
   Those charges were filed ``not to punish the mother but to
protect the child,'' Logli said.
   But when a child dies after events that occurred ``while the
child was still in the womb, the law provides protection for that
child and allows for prosecution of the person who causes those
events,'' he said.
   In December, a Florida woman was charged with child abuse and
delivery of drug after her child was born addicted to cocaine. The
child survived. Prosecutors said it was the first such felony drug
case there.
   In 1987, a judge in California dismissed a charge of failure to
provide medical care to a child, lodged against a woman whose son
was born brain damaged and later died. Prosecutors had accused her
of ignoring a doctor's advice not to abuse drugs.

<DATELINE>HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this burgeoning
golf-and-tennis resort refused Tuesday to clamp down on growth by
tying construction to how long motorists have to wait at lights.
   The referendum for limited development received 9,364 negative
votes, or 68 percent, to 2,995, or 32 percent, in favor, said Town
Clerk Tommy Malone.
   ``As far as we know, this kills this particular issue,'' Ms.
Malone said. ``We were really surprised at the outcome. We expected
it to be very close.''
   However, the measure's author, former Town Councilman Don Hook,
said he had not ruled out the possibility of future referendums.
   Ms. Malone said earlier that she expected a turnout of 50
percent to 60 percent of the island's 14,500 registered voters.
   The measure would have frozen building permits if traffic, as
measured at any of several specified locations, slowed such that
drivers must wait more than two turns of a traffic light during the
peak of the tourist season in June.
   The moratorium would have been lifted once steps to alleviate
the congestion were undertaken.
   Proponents said it would put some teeth into a planning
ordinance approved by residents three years ago. Opponents say the
ordinance already is strong and that a moratorium would cost jobs
and hurt the local economy.
   The population on this 12- by 5-mile seaside resort has grown
from 6,500 year-round residents in 1975 to an estimated 20,000
today. About 1.1 million tourists visit the island each year,
according to the Chamber of Commerce.
   The state Attorney General's Office indicated the measure was
probably unconstitutional because it could deprive property owners
of the use of their property without compensation.
   The measure was placed on the ballot after author Hook and 11
other islanders mounted a petition drive to take the issue to the
voters.
   Last month, the Council approved 6-1 a resolution urging
islanders to reject the measure.
   A telephone survey by The Island Packet newspaper in February
indicated that some 38 percent of those polled were undecided about
the issue.

   A 24-hour general
strike over food prices and inflation paralyzed Santo Domingo and
about 20 other cities Tuesday. A youth was killed and 20 people
were arrested in clashes with police.
   Schools, stores and public transportation shut down throughout
most of this West Indies nation of more than 6.5 million people as
thousands of Dominicans obeyed a call by workers' unions to strike
over food prices and for higher pay. Police said a Secret Service
officer accidentally shot a 17-year-old youth in the head and
killed him during a confrontation in Santo Domingo. No other
casualties were reported.
   Police said youths set up flaming tire barricades in several
areas.
   Hardly any buses ran in this capital city of 2 million people.
   Strike organizers demanded that President Joaquin Balaguer's
government take immediate measures against inflation, now running
at about 30 percent.
   They also demanded improved public services. The power sector
has been plagued by blackouts and water shortages.
   Organizers threatened to extend the walkout unless the
government acted.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Groups Oppose Lucas in Justice Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of civil rights organizations
voiced its opposition Tuesday to the appointment of William Lucas
to head the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said Lucas doesn't
have the experience or litigation skills needed in the position,
which is the federal government's top civil rights job.
   The conference is an umbrella group of 180 organizations and the
opposition was adopted ``by consensus'' at a meeting of the
conference, according to Ralph Neas, executive director of the
organization.
   Neas and Benjamin Hooks, chairman of the conference, said in a
statement that Lucas ``may well be qualified for other important
positions in the federal government, but he does not have the
experience, the substantive knowledge of the increasingly technical
field of civil rights, or the litigation skills to carry out the
duties effectively.''
   The opposition was the latest round in the controversy swirling
around Lucas, a black Detroit lawyer. Lucas, 61, also has been an
FBI agent, sheriff of Wayne County, Mich., and the chief executive
of that county.
   Lucas is being backed for the post by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, some members of
the Congressional Black Caucus and the Rev. Joseph Lowery,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   But the nomination of Lucas, a Democrat-turned-Republican who
lost a race for the Michigan governor's post in 1986, has been
opposed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group.
   The leadership conference position said the organization would
``work to persuade the U.S. Senate to withhold confirmation of the
nomination'' once it is proposed by President Bush.
   Rep. John Conyers, a black Democrat from Detroit, recently said
a Senate fight by civil rights groups opposed to Lucas would be
counterproductive.

   The space shuttle Atlantis
returned from orbit in excellent shape, with only about 100 nicks
in its thermal tiles and scuffed tires from a crosswind landing, a
NASA official said Tuesday.
   Gusty winds up to 25 mph blew sand across Rogers Dry Lake as
technicians worked on Atlantis a day after landing. But work was on
or ahead of schedule and the shuttle was expected to be flown back
to Florida on Saturday.
   ``The spaceship looks really good,'' said Conrad Nagel of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who is in charge of
processing the shuttle.
   Only 12 of the shuttle's protective thermal tiles were likely to
need replacement, Nagel said.
   In comparison, after Atlantis' previous mission in December
1988, there were 1,000 nicks and 162 tiles needed to be replaced.
   ``We feel like we're in very, very good shape,'' Nagel said.
   One window was found to have a nick measuring .08 inch in
diameter. It was being studied to determine if it could be polished
out or would require more extensive repair.
   Atlantis blasted off Thursday from Kennedy Space Center in
Florida and delivered the Magellan probe into orbit. The probe was
then fired onto an 800 million-mile trajectory to Venus.
   The crew also performed a metal crystalization experiment and
photographed lightning and pollution on Earth until one of its four
operating computers malfunctioned on Sunday.
   The crew replaced the computer with a spare and landed safely
Monday.
   The broken computer was being removed from the orbiter and would
be sent to the manufacturer for inspection, Nagel said.
   Atlantis landed in a crosswind of 8 knots, or 9.2 mph, giving
NASA the data it has long sought on how shuttles handle in
crosswinds. The information is needed before NASA can resume
landings in Florida and thus eliminate the need to ferry shuttles
back from California piggyback on a Boeing 747.
   Senior NASA officials have said, however, that they do not
intend to soon abandon Edwards' enormous and forgiving lakebed with
its choice of numerous runways.
   The crosswind landing did cause scuffing of the tires,
particularly the left outboard tire, Nagel said.
   The brakes also apparently came through in good condition. They
had yet to be removed but no tell-tale noises were heard during the
snail-pace two-hour tow of the 122-foot-long, 97-ton shuttle from
the runway to the NASA facility on the edge of the lakebed.
   A valve in a helium system could not be closed after landing.
The helium will be purged before the ferry flight, Nagel said.
   Atlantis will be hoisted onto the back of NASA's Boeing 747 and
is scheduled to take off at 7 a.m. Saturday for what is hoped to be
a one-day flight back to Florida.
   A delayed start would mean a stopover en route.
   ``We really have no major issues or concerns'' with the orbiter,
Nagel said.
   Atlantis may have come through with fewer problems than any of
the shuttle flights since the hiatus caused by the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion of the Challenger.
   ``I would say that right now we probably plan on doing less with
Atlantis this time than we have done with any of the three previous
flights that we've had since we've returned to flight,'' Nagel said.

<TEXT>
   After 10 dynamite explosions in as many
days, a grain elevator has finally yielded a large section to
demolition crews.
   Attempts began more than a week ago to topple the 110-foot
concrete elevator, built around the turn of the century. But when
the dust settled each time, it still stood _ until Monday, when
five of the 19 silos fell. On Tuesday, five more silos came down
after still more blasting.
   Now, blasters are confident that days are numbered for the rest
of the building, too.
   ``It's going like clockwork now,'' said Teri O'Donoghue, a
spokeswoman for the land developer that owns the property.
   ``We were hoping it would fall today but we weren't positive,''
Jerry Vann, who is heading the demolition project, said Monday.
Vann is president of Blasting Specialists Inc., a Chicago-based
company.
   As the first silos collapsed, nearby buildings shook and clouds
of white dust puffed over the remaining concrete towers.
   ``This is a beautiful sight,'' said Vann.
   He had planned to spend only 10 days on the job. Instead, Vann
has spent 30 days drilling and placing dynamite in the silos and
nine days blasting at the elevator's base.
   He said he expects to topple the remaining columns by this
weekend ``unless we get thunderstorms or bad weather.''
   The McCurdy Peanut Elevator is built of concrete up to two feet
thick, reinforced with heavy steel rods, to withstand the force of
a grain dust explosion, officials said. The peanut company bought
the elevator from a grain company.
   Vann said he could have destroyed the silos sooner but city
safety officials limited the amount of dynamite he could detonate
at any one time.
   ``We are working at this slow and steady so we don't endanger
anything around here,'' he said. ``I would rather shoot four or
five times, just to make sure no one gets hurt.''
   A land developer intends to transform the grain elevator's
28-acre site into a hotel and office development.

<HEAD>Murder Convict Resigns as Honorary Student President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of murdering a police officer
resigned Tuesday as honorary president of the student union at the
London School of Economics because of the uproar over his election.
   Winston Silcott, who is serving a 30-year minimum prison
sentence for the killing, said in a statement released by his
attorney that he was giving up the honor to spare his student
supporters grief.
   He thanked them but added, ``I have no wish for them to be made
scapegoats as I have been.''
   Administrators at the famous college, members of the governing
Conservative Party, and government officials had attacked the
students' election of Silcott. Education Secretary Kenneth Baker
described it as a ``shameful and despicable'' action of the ``loony
left.''
   However, school officials said they did not have the authority
to reverse it.
   The campus chapter of the National Union of Students accepted
Silcott's resignation.
   Indraprasad Patel, college director, said there would be a
review of the relationship between the college and the student
union to ensure such a thing never happens again. He said the
college had been ``gravely embarrassed'' by a small minority of
students who gathered April 27 to pick Silcott for the one-year
ceremonial term.
   The students voted for him to express sympathy for his claims
that he is innocent.
   The 29-year-old black and two other people were convicted of
murdering a white police officer with machetes during a riot at a
predominantly black housing project in north London in 1985.
Silcott was out on bail for another murder at the time.

   The government under Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega denounced international observers who said he stole
the presidential election, and it declared Tuesday that its own
candidate was ahead by almost two to one.
   In Washington, President Bush demanded that Noriega ``heed the
call of the people'' and abandon power. Bush said reports by U.S.
observers ``demonstrate clearly that despite massive irregularities
at the polls the opposition has won a clear-cut, overwhelming
victory'' in Sunday's election.
   The opposition claims a 3-1 victory. It said it was paying no
attention to official results and offered to negotiate.
   ``We are ready to enter a dialogue between civilians and the
military to find a solution to the nation's crisis,'' Ricardo Arias
Calderon, the opposition candidate for first vice president, told a
news conference Monday.
   Government foes staged no further demonstrations, and truckloads
of troops coursed through the streets.
   Police broke up a brief confrontation between pro- and
anti-government supporters at the home of Archbishop Marcos
McGrath, the country's Roman Catholic leader, who was meeting with
the opposition leadership.
   Walls, telephone poles and palm trees still bore campaign
posters, but stores that were boarded up in anticipation of
violence were reopening.
   The government said Noriega's candidate, Carlos Duque, was
leading opposition candidate Guillermo Endara by 51,752 to 26,878
with 12 of 40 districts reported.
   The opposition released figures from its own pollwatchers saying
it was leading by 236,097 to 79,260 with 35.8 percent of the vote
counted.
   Retiree Carlos Halphen summed up an opinion expressed by many
when asked what would happen next.
   ``We want the United States to do something. The U.S. got us
into this mess, it should get us out,'' he said.
   U.S. observers discussed with Bush in Washington options for
putting more pressure on Noriega to step down.
   The United States has imposed damaging economic sanctions on the
government but has been unable to oust Noriega as commander of the
15,000-strong Defense Forces and as de facto ruler.
   ``This election was a terrible fraud on the Panamanian people,''
said Rep. Larry Smith, R-Fla., a member of an uninvited observer
delegation sent by Bush. ``Polls opened late, peoples' names were
not on lists, dead peoples' names were on lists after years of not
appearing on lists.''
   Duque denounced ``obvious American intervention in affairs that
concern only Panama'' and said claims of stolen tallies were ``the
stuff of a soap opera plot.''
   Venezuelan government spokesman Pastor Heydra said in Caracas
that Latin American foreign ministers will meet in Lima, Peru _
possibly on Wednesday _ to consider ousting Panama from the
regional Group of Eight organization because of the electoral fraud
allegations. The organization suspended Panama after Noriega
engineered Eric Delvalle's ouster as Panamanian president in
February 1988.
   Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, and
Mexico belong to the Group of Eight, which promotes political and
economic integration in Latin America.
   Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Ritter, accused Washington late
Monday of ``creating a climate for military intervention.'' His
comments were broadcast on news reports Tuesday.
   The government frequently has accused the United States of
plotting with the opposition to abrogate treaties under which
Panama would gain control of the Panama Canal at the end of the
century.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who signed the treaties, said
Monday that Noriega's soldiers seized legitimate election returns
and that the results being tallied were counterfeit.
   He said he believed an exit poll conducted by the Catholic
church, which had the opposition leading 3-1, was an accurate
reflection of the true count.
   Carter left Panama on Tuesday morning after denouncing Noriega
as a dictator who was stealing the election from the Panamanian
people.
   Election Tribunal spokesman Boris Moreno said tabulation board
president Diomedes Rosas had told Carter he was an invited guest
and could not pass judgment, give advice or issue conclusions.
Carter stalked out, Moreno said.
   ``Noriega thought he was going to legitimize his regime.
Instead, it has been delegitimized,'' said a U.S. Embassy official.
   Noriega himself kept silent on the results and met with
government officials and acting President Manuel Solis Palma, who
is to step down Sept. 1.
   The vote counting center was surrounded Tuesday by a large
detachment of troops and truck-mounted machine guns.
   Moreno said troops were brought in because the government feared
rioting when more official results are announced.
   On Monday, a protest march by more than 15,000 people was broken
up with gunfire and three people were wounded, one seriously.
   Tuesday afternoon, Arias Calderon, Endara and second vice
presidential candidate Guillermo Ford visited McGrath.
   A few dozen armed paramilitary Noriega supporters surrounded the
house and dozens of Endara supporters gathered, but police
scattered the crowd by firing shots in the air.
   Endara said the candidates told McGrath of their desire for a
peaceful solution.
   Ritter said the international press was painting a distorted
picture of Panama and complained about U.S. Southern Command
television station broadcasts.
   The Southern Command station, the only uncensored station left
in Panama, was watched eagerly by many Panamanians, although it
broadcasts only in English.
   U.S.-Panama relations have been hostile since Noriega
orchestrated Delvalle's ouster last year. The CIA reportedly
contributed $10 million to the opposition campaign.
   Delvalle tried to fire the general after he was indicted in
Florida on drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges. Noriega
claims the U.S. charges are a smokescreen to keep the canal.

   A Picasso self-portrait painted in 1901 sold for
$47.85 million Tuesday, a record for the artist and the
second-highest price ever paid for a single artwork at auction.
   The price paid at Sotheby's for ``Yo Picasso,'' painted when the
artist was 20 years old, was more than twice its pre-sale estimate
and $9.4 million more than the previous record for the Spanish
artist.
   ``It's in another stratosphere, but it's because there's a lot
of cash around,'' Paloma Picasso, the artist's daughter who
attended the auction, said when asked if she thought the bidding
had gotten out of hand.
   ``It's better that these people use their money for these
paintings rather than planes and bombs,'' she said.
   ``Yo Picasso'' last sold in 1981 for $5.5 million.
   The sale of 67 Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Modern
works brought a total of $204.82 million, a record for a single
auction, topping the previous high of $117 million set in April at
Sotheby's in London.
   Works by Gauguin, Cezanne and Kandinsky also commanded
record-breaking prices at the Tuesday sale as the annual spring
art-buying frenzy continues.
   The winning bid, made by telephone, for the Picasso was followed
by long applause. The identity of the winning bidder was not
disclosed.
   The painting was sold for Wendell Cherry, president and chief
executive officer of Humana Inc., the hospital management
corporation based in Louisville, Ky.
   Another record was broken when Paul Gauguin's ``Mata Mua (In
Olden Times),'' sold for $24.2 million. The 1892 painting is an
idyllic, colorful landscape completed during the artist's first
trip to Tahiti.
   A still life, ``Pichet et Fruits sur une Table,'' painted by
Paul Cezanne in 1893-94, sold for $11.55 million, $2.3 million more
than the previous highest price for a Cezanne.
   An abstract landscape by Wassili Kandinsky,
``Herbstlandschaft,'' sold for $3.96 million, a record for the
Russian-born artist.
   Other works that commanded prices in the millions were:
   _ Two portraits by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The first, ``Jeune
Fille au Chapeau Garni de Fleurs des Champs,'' was painted in 1880
and brought $13.75 million. The other, ``Couple Lisant,'' painted
in 1877, sold for $3.08 million.
   _ An early Claude Monet, ``Garden House on the Banks of the
Zaan,'' painted in 1871, sold for $11 million.
   A portrait by Monet of his second wife, ``Alice Hoschede au
Jardin,'' brought $8.8 million.
   _ Mary Cassatt's ``Augusta Reading to Her Daughter'' fetched
$3.08 million.
   _ ``Asters et Fruits sur une Table,'' a still life by Henri
Fantin-Latour, brought $1.87 million.
   _ ``Fete de Septembre, Pontoise,'' a city scene by Camille
Pissarro, dated 1872, sold for $1.98 million.
   ``Laveuses au Bord de la Touques,'' a beach scene by Eugene
Boudin, bettered its pre-sale estimate of between $200,000 and
$300,000, selling for $407,000.
   All prices include the auction house's 10 percent commission.
   Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises'' sold for $53.9 million in 1987 _
the most ever paid for an artwork at auction.
   The previous record for a Picasso, who died in 1973, was $38.46
million last year for ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin.''
   The record for a Gauguin was set just last month: $10.36 million
for ``The Fare Hymenee.'' Cezanne's ``La Cote du Galet, A
Pontoise,'' sold in 1988 for $9.24 million.
   The previous record for a Kandinsky was set in 1987 when
``Murnau-Landschaft Mit Kirsche I'' sold for $2.4 million.
   The first eight canvasses on the block at Sotheby's, including
the Gauguin and Renoirs, were from the collection of Jamie
Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, now living in
Switzerland.
   Sotheby's and Christie's, two of the largest auction houses in
the world, hope to ring up $572 million from 4,472 art works over
12 days of sales that began May 2.

   Former Mayor Gerald McCann and City
Council President Glenn Cunningham survived a mayoral free-for-all
with a record 10 candidates Tuesday, and will meet in a runoff.
   Incumbent Mayor Anthony Cucci lost a bid for a second, four-year
term, after placing fourth in the non-partisan race.
   With all of the votes counted, unofficial returns showed McCann
with 13,196 votes and Cunningham with 9,292 votes.
   ``I don't think there's even a comparison between us. I think
I'm by far the best candidate,'' McCann said after winning his spot
in the runoff June 13.
   ``Today was a rejection of old style politics. Councilman
Cunningham and I ran a clean, positive campaign,'' he said. ``The
people of Jersey City said that that's the style of politics they
want in the future.''
   Cunningham would become the city's first black mayor.
   The other candidates and their vote totals were: former Mayor
Thomas F.X. Smith, 6,482; Cucci, 6,342; Councilman Thomas
Fricchione, 6,260; banker Peter Murphy, 4,138; Councilman Thomas
Hart, 2,180; attorney Michael Bell, 1,324; police officer Richard
Boggiano, 1,077; and former City Council President Bobby Jackson,
826.

   Jersey City, across the Hudson River from New York City's lower
Manhattan, has about 95,000 registered voters, a decline of about
10 percent since the last mayoral election.
   Only 52 percent of the registered voters cast ballots, officials
said.
   The candidates battered each other with scurrilous attacks
during the long campaign in the state's second-largest city, where
politics has a reputation for decisions made in smoke-filled
backrooms.
   Some candidates resorted to putting fangs on unflattering
cartoons and caricatures of their opponents in some advertisements,
fairly typical of election day here.
   Smith served as mayor from 1977 until 1981, and McCann was mayor
from 1981 to 1985.
   All together, there were 102 candidates for the mayor's post and
nine council seats.

   A judge ordered the U.S. government to
reconsider the Agent Orange health claims of more than 31,000
veterans because existing rules ``sharply tipped the scales''
against those exposed to the toxic defoliant.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson struck down the Department
of Veterans Affairs' regulations that denied Agent Orange
service-related benefits for cancers and all other diseases except
one non-fatal skin condition.
   In a ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of Agent
Orange claimants, Henderson said the department was wrong to
require direct proof that the dioxin-containing herbicide caused
various diseases.
   The department, formerly known as the Veterans Administration,
should give claimants the benefit of the doubt, he said.

   U.S. naval vessels are transporting nuclear

forbids ``introduction'' of such loads, a researcher says.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that U.S. ships still transit
Japan with nuclear weapons aboard,'' researcher William Arkin of
the liberal Institute for Policy Studies said Monday in an

   Arkin made the comment after releasing evidence about a 1965

   Exxon says it has spent more than $95
million to clean up the Alaska oil spill and could have contained

chemical dispersants.
   A top state official, however, accused Exxon of spreading a

dispersants.
   Also Monday, Gov. Steve Cowper signed a bill raising state taxes

   Adult cocaine abusers told interviewers
they averaged nearly seven years of use without drug-related
problems, a ``honeymoon period'' that might undercut warnings to
adolescents about the drug, a researcher says.
   ``For some, it may not be helpful to say, `coke is going to get
you,' when they see adults day after day who've been using cocaine
for years who aren't in trouble yet,'' said psychiatrist Anne Kolar.
   But her study also found evidence that young people reach their
first negative experience with cocaine sooner. If further research
bears that out, publicizing it may make warnings to adolescents
seem more credible, she said.
   The study by Kolar and colleagues at the Addiction Research
Center in Baltimore was presented Monday at the American
Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Roe vs. Wade'' is bound to start a lot of
living-room debates, but one fact is inarguable _ this is as good
as television drama gets.
   NBC's story of the legalization of abortion, airing Monday, is
graced by Emmy-worthy performances down to the smallest supporting
role and a courageous script that takes a stand without talking
down to the other side.
   Holly Hunter (``Broadcast News'') stars as Ellen Russell, a
penniless drifter who has left an abusive husband and been forced
to give her daughter to her mother to raise. Unmarried and pregnant
again, she faces the prospect of having to give up another baby for
adoption.
   Hardly the most sympathetic case imaginable _ ``You have the
morals of a cat,'' snipes her mother _ she is nevertheless the only
woman willing to allow two young female lawyers to use her case as
a test of Texas' stringent anti-abortion law.
   The character of Ellen is based on Norma McCorvey, the
real-life, then-anonymous ``Jane Roe'' who sued Dallas District
Attorney Henry Wade for enforcing the law. Her case led to the 1973
U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. The Supreme Court
recently heard arguments on a Missouri case, and the justices'
ruling this summer could effect the 1973 decision.
   Producers used pseudonyms for McCorvey, her relatives and
friends to protect their privacy. Since work on the script began
three years ago, however, McCorvey has become a public critic of
efforts to overturn the abortion decision.
   Other characters' real names are used. Amy Madigan (``Field of
Dreams'') is excellent as Sarah Weddington, the neophyte lawyer who
successfully argues the case, first before a panel of federal
judges in Texas. They find the anti-abortion law unconstitutionally
vague but refuse to grant an injunction, leaving the law on the
books until the decision can be appealed and forcing Ellen to
continue with the pregnancy.
   ``You might explain to me how it is you won and I lost,'' says a
distraught Ellen when Weddington calls to explain the decision to
her.
   The movie follows the dual struggles of Russell as she is
refused job after job because she is pregnant, and Weddington, who
finds plenty of support but scant actual help preparing the complex
case for the high court. Her partner, Linda Coffey (Annabella
Price), has to virtually drop out because of the demands of other
legal work.
   By the time Weddington argues the case before the Supreme Court
in 1973, Ellen has long since had her baby and given it up for
adoption, the only solution the state offers. In the movie's most
powerful scene, Ellen vainly tugs at the delivery table restraints
trying to get a glimpse of the baby as it is carried away. She
doesn't even know if it's a boy or a girl.
   Ultimately, because the movie tells the story of the women who
won the case, it cannot avoid being pro-choice. ``If you can't take
care of a baby or aren't ready to, it shouldn't matter what the
reasons are,'' Weddington argues at one point. ``You shouldn't have
to bear a child and give it up for adoption just because the state
of Texas says so.''
   But the other side is treated sympathetically through Terry
O'Quinn's eloquently understated portrayal of Jay Floyd, the
assistant attorney general assigned the task of defending the Texas
law. Floyd, like Weddington, has never argued before the Supreme
Court. The bachelor begins receiving mail from women's groups on
Weddington's side. One letter suggests he might understand the
issue better if he had a uterus transplant.
   ``I thought I'd write back that I may not have a uterus, but I
was definitely a baby,'' Floyd tells a colleague.
   When the two lawyers go before the high court, Weddington has
the force of conviction on her side. Floyd is still struggling with
the issue. He argues for the sanctity of human life, pinpointing it
as beginning a vague few days after conception.
   ``That's really when the soul comes into the body _ if one
believes in a soul, I don't know,'' he stammers. Afterward, he is
convinced that the court had already made up its mind. ``Has anyone
ever presented so dazzling an argument that it brought them
around?'' he wonders.
   No made-for-TV movie can be so dazzling as to change minds on an
issue that touches people so deeply. But producer Michael Manheim,
producer-director Gregory Hoblit and producer-writer Alison Cross
have run an emotional and political obstacle course and emerged
with an exceptionally fine film. Whatever their point of view, they
should be congratulated for humanizing the issue and taking a stand
where sticking to the middle ground just wouldn't do.

   A man who has seen them all _ television
situation comedies, that is _ says there was nobody like Lucy.
   Comedian Lucille Ball, who died April 26 of a ruptured aorta at
the age of 77, became a legend because of TV's ``I Love Lucy,''
which defined the sitcom genre when it first aired in 1951, and was
the model for a host of shows that followed.
   ```I Love Lucy' was so successful _ three years as the No. 1
show _ that virtually every (sitcom) that came after it was an
`actcom' until 1957,'' said Richard Taflinger, a professor of
communications at Washington State University.
   He said 90 percent of sitcoms are action comedies or
``actcoms.'' They start with a disruption of the status quo and
then follow the central character's actions as he or she tries to
restore things to normal. The character invariably causes further,
more humorous disruptions.
   Characters in actcoms are one-dimensional, unchanging and
unthinking. But the special ones such as Lucy Ricardo are
hilariously entertaining, Taflinger said.
   ``The penultimate actcom is, of course, `I Love Lucy,''' he said.
   The redheaded actress and her first husband, the late Desi
Arnaz, not only set the standard for comedy, Taflinger said, they
revolutionized television production by using three cameras in
their California studio to film the show in sequence before a live
audience.
   ``They totally changed television forever,'' he said.
   Sitcom episodes fill a sizable chunk of Taflinger's memory
banks, since he spent two years watching them seven hours a day.
Few couch potatoes could match such viewing habits, but Taflinger
was doing research for his book, ``Sitcom: What It Is and How It
Works.''
   ``I've watched at least one episode of every sitcom that's been
on the air since 1950, about 500 or so,'' he said.
   Taflinger has watched all 140 ``I Love Lucy'' episodes, all 160
of ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' and all 200 of ``M-A-S-H.'' He's also
analyzed obscure, short-lived programs that few television viewers
ever saw, such as ``Shirley's World,'' which starred Shirley
MacLaine for all of three episodes.
   But Taflinger said the series that had the briefest run was a
Tim Conway vehicle called ``Time Out.'' Cloned from the popular
``Laugh-In,'' ``Time Out'' drew such a flood of complaints during
its first 10 minutes on the air that the plug was pulled on the
program halfway through its hour-long premiere.
   Sitcoms, like jokes, must meet specific criteria to be funny,
Taflinger explained. The formula says effective humor must:
   _ Appeal to the intellect rather than the emotions.
   _ Be inherently human.
   _ Have its basis in a familiar set of societal norms.
   _ Involve actions or dialogue inconsistent with those norms or
unsuitable to the surroundings.
   _ Be perceived as harmless or painless to the participants.
   The second type of sitcom was the domestic comedy, which
Taflinger said began exploring character development, with children
becoming central to the plots. ``Father Knows Best'' was the first
in 1957, and later successes included ``My Three Sons,'' ``The
Brady Bunch,'' ``The Courtship of Eddie's Father,'' ``Family
Affair'' and ``Family Ties.''
   The top-rated show of recent seasons has been ``The Cosby
Show,'' but Taflinger said it isn't really a domestic comedy
anymore.
   ``I'm not entirely sure what it is,'' he said. ``It's great fun
to watch Bill Cosby do stand-up comedy, but nothing happens; they
have no problems.
   ``They simply live, which is why it's starting to slip in the
ratings, I think.''
   A number of sitcoms in between ``I Love Lucy'' and ``Cosby''
that were built around other established stars have not enjoyed the
huge popularity of those two series. Taflinger said the flops _
including Shirley MacLaine's show, ``The Jimmy Stewart Show'' and
``The Smith Family'' starring Henry Fonda _ lacked good scripts and
other necessary elements for a successful sitcom.
   The same principle applied to recent ill-fated attempts at
resurrecting TV veterans Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, whose
long-running original series concluded with final episodes.
   The very popular ``Mork and Mindy,'' a spinoff of ``Happy
Days,'' faded quickly after it began relying too much on Robin
Williams' antics to carry the show, Taflinger said.
   Not even Lucille Ball, whose return to series television in 1962
with ``The Lucy Show'' (later changed to ``Here's Lucy'') lasted 13
years, was immune from a flop. Her 1986 ``Life With Lucy'' sitcom
drew low ratings and was canceled within two months.
   Her last sitcom ``really wasn't a very good show; it depended
more on the fact that it was Lucy than on good writing and
producing a good, quality show,'' Taflinger said. He also noted
that at 75, she was unable to do the physical, slapstick comedy
with which Lucy Ricardo delighted audiences in the '50s.
   ``Plus, in today's network market a show must succeed almost
instantly or it's canceled,'' he said, noting that the original Van
Dyke show was nearly canceled after a few episodes but built an
audience by the end of its first 13-week season.
   The rarest variety of sitcom is the dramatic comedy, which must
have well-rounded characters who are humorous but also think, cry,
lose and sometimes die, Taflinger said. There have only been a
handful of ``dramedies'' _ ``All in the Family,'' ``M.A.S.H.,''
``Barney Miller,'' ``Maude'' _ but all enjoyed successful runs and
also ended with a final episode rather than cancellation.
   Taflinger expects the only drama-comedy (``dramedy'') currently
airing, ``Night Court,'' to last until its producers decide to end
it with a final episode.
   Taflinger's sitcom research began in 1972, and his two years of
seven-hours-a-day viewing spanned 1978-80, when he was writing his
dissertation at Washington State. He continued his research and
expanded it into his sitcom manuscript. He has about 3,000 sitcom
soundtracks recorded on cassette tapes. He listens to them while
driving, watching reruns of favorite episodes in his mind's eye.
   He remains an avid television viewer, and said ``Cheers,''
``Night Court'' and ``The Wonder Years'' are shows that can still
evoke laughs from him, but he doesn't see any of the current crop
of sitcoms with any staying power.

<HEAD>Catholic Church Tackles Cohabitation, Interreligious Marriages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church is taking a harder line toward
cohabiting couples seeking traditional church weddings, but is
making it easier than ever before for Catholics to wed people of
other faiths.
   A new handbook on marriage preparationdrawn up by a committee of
U.S. bishops states priests are taking an increasingly
confrontational approach toward cohabiting couples who ``create an
occasion of scandal for others by weakening the sanctity of
marriage itself.''
   ``You have to face the issue. We can't ignore it,'' said Bishop
Phillip F. Straling of San Bernardino, Calif., chairman of an
ad-hoc committee that drafted the handbook titled ``Faithful to
Each Other Forever.'' ``Marriage is not just a convenience, but a
sacred gift.''
   While the document, published May 8, strives to take what its
authors call a ``countercultural'' approach toward sexual ethics,
the bishops take an ecumenical approach toward another social trend
_ interreligious marriages.
   The handbook establishes guidelines encouraging cooperative
relations with non-Catholic clergy involved with the wedding and
mandating religious freedom for both spouses, stating the wedding
should never be the cause of any conversion.
   Valerie Dillon, president of the National Association of
Catholic Diocesan Family Life Ministers and a consultant to the
report, said interreligious marriages ``are really serving as
models of ecumenical growth, and they are the wave of the future.''
   The 400-page handbook was drawn up by the Bishops' Committee for
Pastoral Research and Practices in response to a 1983 Vatican
directive for national episcopal conferences to issue norms for
priests and others involved in marriage preparation in the 53
million-member denomination.
   The handbook also was approved by the Administrative Committee
of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   The Denver City Council last week abolished a ``living-in-sin''
law as outmoded, but with the number of Americans living together
before marriage tripling to 2 million in the period from 1970-84,
priests have been losing their inhibitions about confronting
cohabiting Catholics with traditional church teaching, Monsignor
Joseph M. Champlin, the chief author of the marriage handbook, said
in an interview.
   ``Twenty to 25 years ago, priests generally tended to overlook
the fact they were living together,'' Champlin said. ``It's like
parents; sometimes it's better not to know what the kids are
doing.''
   The new handbook states that while priests remain concerned
about alienating Catholics seeking the sacrament of marriage,
church leaders and clergy have increasingly adopted a more
challenging, confrontational approach to cohabiting couples.
   ``The negative statistics and harmful effects of cohabitation
... certainly contributed to that new development, as well as the
question of scandal to others and the potential injury to the
sanctity of marriage.''
   Since 1984, the dioceses of St. Cloud, Minn., and Cleveland have
established policies encouraging cohabiting couples to separate and
generally allowing only small, nuptial masses for couples who
refuse to live apart.
   Champlin said such dioceses have decided that ``to have a big
ceremony with a great dramatization is like making a mockery of
marriage itself.''
   While the handbook emphasizes traditional church teaching
forbidding premarital sex, the decision for handling individual
couples is left to priests.
   ``We don't condone what they have been doing, but we try to
straighten things out,'' Straling said.
   Mrs. Dillon said the church needs to confront couples living
together ``not to be punitive,'' but to ensure they're marrying for
sacramental reasons as opposed to pressure from their families or
other reasons.
   ``The church says marriage for any reason other than a free
desire to commit to each other for life is not an acceptable reason
for marriage within the church,'' she said.
   In the area of interreligious marriages, the church has moved
from confrontation to conciliation in the last generation.
   ``There's just been a tremendous growth in the kind of
collaborative approach,'' said Monsignor Champlin, also the author
of ``Together for Life,'' a book of prayers for the wedding liturgy
that has been used by two-thirds of the couples married by Catholic
priests over the last 20 years.
   In his own family, he recalled, his mother was married to a
non-Catholic in a rectory and his brother was married outside of
the communion railing. Today, he said, Catholics are able to get
married with the church's blessing at a Protestant church even if a
priest is not present.
   With 40 percent of American Catholics entering into
interreligious marriages, the bishops state in the marriage
handbook that the trend is ``a reality to which we must respond in
as positive a way as possible.''
   The handbook encourages the Catholic and non-Catholic spouse to
become familiar with the teachings of each other's religion and
mandates that both spouses enjoy ``total freedom'' with regard to
their own beliefs.
   ``An interreligious marriage may be the occasion, but must never
be the cause of any conversion,'' the handbook said.
   While same-faith marriages have some advantages, Straling said
the bishops wanted to stress in the document: ``Interreligious
marriages can work and do work.''

   The moderate candidate for the Southern
Baptist Convention presidency, the Rev. Daniel Vestal of Atlanta,
says he will try to dilute the power of the office if he is elected.
   Fundamentalists have won the presidency over the last 10 years
and used the presidential appointive power to name trustees
controlling the denomination's agencies.
   ``For the last 10 years it has been winner take all,'' Vestal
told a meeting of moderates, saying he hopes to change that pattern
to ``winner shares all.''
   He is to oppose the fundamentalist-backed incumbent president,
the Rev. Jerry Vines of Jacksonville, Fla., when the Southern
Baptists meet in Las Vegas June 13-15.
   Moderates say they have been excluded from key appointments _
particularly to a powerful committee which names trustees governing
denominational agencies _in the decade in which the denomination
has come under fundamentalist control.

   Historic theological agreements reached
among different churches in recent years will come to naught if
churches don't go beyond talk to action in reuniting Christianity,
a major ecumenical conference was told.
   The Rev. Michael Kinnamon, dean of Lexington (Ky.) Theological
Seminary said the new accords must be followed up with ``decisive,
imaginative leadership if we are to break through from one stage of
the ecumenical movement to the next.''
   Failure to do so will lead to cynicism, frustration and
abandonment of the cause, he told a gathering about 500 Roman
Catholic, Protestant, Episcopal and Eastern Orthodox
representatives.
   ``We have a library of acknowledged `common convictions,' but .
.. we have not sufficiently acknowledged the pressure they should
exert on us for living and acting together.''

   Church leaders from South Korea and
communist North Korea worshipped, discussed and sang together in a
rare gathering here contemplating reunion of their divided country.
   In the first visit to the United States since Korea was divided
in 1945 at the end of World War II, four North Korean Christains
met with South Korean church representatives, along with about 100
U.S. church leaders.
   The Rev. Dwain Epps, international affairs officer of the
National Council of Churches which sponsored the conference, said:
   ``We don't have the power in our hands to make peace or reunify
Korea. But we have the opportunity to respond to the call of the
Christians of the South and North to assist them to find a
reunified future.''
   The council launched an ecumenical campaign to educate U.S.
church members about continuing human costs of a divided Korea,
including separation of families and a devastating war in which 4
million died.

   Marilyn Adams sees hidden killers in
peaceful farm country. They're around the barns, the tractors and
even the golden grain that proved deadly to her youngest child,
swallowing the boy like quicksand.
   Keith Algreen was 11 years old when he died in a farm accident.
His mother aches for him. She is also determined her loss be a
lesson so other families will not face such tragedy or suffer such
sadness.
   Mrs. Adams has formed an organization to preach the gospel of
farm safety. It's an all-consuming cause, taking her from
classrooms to Capitol Hill, talking with children, homemakers,
lawmakers and anyone else who'll listen.
   ``I've let this become my entire life,'' she said quietly. ``I
guess this is my replacement for Keith's life.''
   ``Farm Safety for Just Kids'' is essentially a one-woman
campaign with a common-sense message: Beware of everyday dangers _
tractors that roll over and crush, pesticides that poison, flowing
grain that can suffocate.
   Often these things ``are overlooked because of the
familiarity,'' Mrs. Adams said. ``A lot of people accept farm
accidents as way of life.''
   Children are particularly vulnerable, she said, because they
work side-by-side with their parents.
   ``We give children an adult responsibility (and) ... they're
just not old enough to handle it,'' she said. ``An 8-year-old or a
10-year-old is not qualified to be a heavy equipment operator, but
yet we have 8- and 10-year-old tractor drivers out there. There is
a definite attitude change that needs to come about. That has to
start at home.''
   Tragedy struck at her home in this tiny central Iowa town at
harvest time in 1986.
   Keith had stayed home from school that October day to help his
stepfather unload corn. He was supposed to turn the tractor power
off when the corn emptied from a gravity wagon that holds 250
bushels, about three tons of grain. The grain falls through a
funnel-shaped chute into an auger that carries it into a bin.
   Mrs. Adams isn't sure how it happened, but Keith fell into the
wagon and was sucked down into the flowing grain. He was found near
the chute about 20 minutes later by his stepfather, who had been
working in the field.
   At the hospital, corn and corn chaff were found in Keith's
lungs. He was declared brain dead.
   ``I could tell when it was finally over,'' his mother said. ``It
was 3 o'clock in the morning. His little body just shook the whole
time ... and then he stopped trembling.''
   Keith died of suffocation. His eyes, heart valves and a kidney
were donated to five people.
   His death devastated a family that was so safety conscious that
Keith wore a life-jacket when he went fishing and frogging in the
pond on their farm.
   Mrs. Adams, 38, who has two surviving daughters and three
stepchildren, saw painful reminders everywhere. She quit a
bookkeeping job because the fire department-rescue squad was
outside her window. She left a bank teller's position because it
hurt so much when children Keith's age came in to make little
deposits.
   After about six months, the mother's anguish turned to activism.
She started calling manufacturers, gathering information to figure
out what happened.
   Mrs. Adams then decided to design safety decals for gravity
wagons and, with financing from her employer at the time, Firestone
Tire &amp; Rubber Co., distributed 50,000 of them. Two companies now
use her decals on their wagons or augers; two others have their own.
   Mrs. Adams also began testifying before congressional committees
and addressing farm groups. She now seeks a sponsor to pay for
educational materials for schools and hopes to have chapters of
``Farm Safety for Just Kids'' set up around the country within six
months.
   Mrs. Adams has memorized the sobering statistics.
   The National Safety Council estimates about 1,600 people died
and 160,000 suffered disabling injuries in 1987 in
agriculture-related incidents.
   As for children, a 1987 Mayo Clinic study said 300 die and
23,500 are injured annually in farm-related accidents.
   The Mayo study, which reviewed accidents involving 87 farm
children, also found the greatest number of injuries occur at age 3
and age 13. About two-thirds of the accidents surveyed were caused
by grain augers and tractors.
   Still, the problem didn't receive much attention until Mrs.
Adams ``grabbed on to the issue like a bulldog,'' said Kelley
Donham, a University of Iowa professor and chairman of the National
Coalition for Agricultural Safety and Health.
   He said Mrs. Adams provides a special perspective as a victim's
mother.
   ``Her experience has ... put a lightning rod on the whole
issue,'' he said.
   Her friend, Fredi Juri, president of the Iowa Organization of
Women for Agriculture, agrees. When Mrs. Adams talks, ``all of a
sudden the statistics have a name and a face,'' she said.
   ``It's very easy to sit back and say, `I can't make a
difference,''' she added. ``She has the gumption to at least try.''
   It isn't always easy.
   Mrs. Adams, a slender, bespectacled woman, still grieves for the
little boy with the earnest grin who wanted to become a minister.
   Keith's drawings of spaceships and helicopters are in a brass
chest. The calf he fed and tended was never sent to market. His red
bicycle gathers cobwebs in the barn. Ten ounces of ``fool's gold''
he found are stored in a pouch, except one nugget his mother wears
around her neck.
   ``Birthdays and family dinners, that's when I miss him the
most,'' Mrs. Adams said. ``I still have a lot of tearful nights.''
   Church and community activities are trying, too. ``You're
watching all of his friends grow up and it's just difficult because
that's when I have to address the real side of it, when you go to
these things and he's not there. As long as I address the business
side of it and can save lives, my emotions are pretty much OK.''
   Keith would have been 14 last month. Mrs. Adams visited his
grave on his birthday. One side of his tombstone has an etching of
a treehouse like the one he built at his grandma's house months
before he died; the other side has a drawing of a pot of gold with
nuggets dropping in and the words ``Our Little Prospector.''
   ``He probably is guiding this whole thing somehow,'' Mrs. Adams
said, her voice quavering. ``He would be very proud.''

   Frances Sandoval's enemy is mean and tough and
lives in a world where life is cheap and death is common. She
already knows this foe can kill _ her son was a victim.
   Gang violence killed Arthur Sandoval. He was 15. His mother
mourned, then rose to face the gangs and say enough is enough.
   She formed ``Mothers Against Gangs,'' a call to action for those
like her who've seen so many young lives destroyed, so much blood
shed and so many dreams snuffed out.
   ``Gangs represent death, pain and suffering,'' said the
35-year-old Ms. Sandoval. ``This is not one family's problem. It's
all the families in the community. ... Only together can we send
the message we're not going to accept you or tolerate you. It's
reinforcing (the fact) we have some control over the destiny of our
children.''
   ``Mothers Against Gangs'' monitors court cases, lobbies
lawmakers, accompanies victims' families to trials and leads
campaigns to clean up the graffiti gangs use to mark their
territory.
   Arthur died in January 1985. He and a buddy had gone to look for
the friend's sister and found her talking to five gang members.
   A fight broke out and as Arthur and his friend were leaving, a
sixth gang member appeared. He stuck a knife into Arthur's heart,
pulled it out and stabbed him again.
   Ms. Sandoval later tracked down the woman who had cradled her
dying son. ``She told me she held my son and covered him with a
coat,'' she said. ``All he said was he was cold.''
   Three gang members identified Arthur's killer, Ms. Sandoval
said, but he had no job or family to keep him in the area and
police weren't optimistic about capturing him.
   So a determined Ms. Sandoval appealed for help on English- and
Spanish-speaking television and radio. She offered a $1,000 reward.
   In less than two weeks, an anonymous caller phoned police and
the man was picked up.
   The family's pain had just begun. That year, Ms. Sandoval's
younger son, Vincent, failed in school. Her daughter, Lydia,
attempted suicide with an overdose of epilepsy medication.
   ``All she knew was her brother was dead and the person who
killed him was alive,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ``She completely
disassociated herself from the legal system.''
   In the fall of 1985, the accused, who said he mistook Arthur's
fatigue jacket for one from a rival gang, was convicted of murder.
Before the judge imposed a 35-year-sentence, Ms. Sandoval turned to
Arthur's killer, Juan Lopez Rojo.
   ``I said, `You did not know my son and my son did not know you.
Animals kill for survival. But you killed for the sake of killing.
You pursued him to kill him. You should receive the same sentence
as you gave to Arthur.'
   ``This was a future that was murdered, not just a person,'' she
now says, her eyes welling with tears. Arthur was an honors student
who dreamed of becoming a Marine, she said.
   Publicity about Ms. Sandoval's plight prompted other victims'
mothers to call, most of them seeking help or just a sympathetic
ear.
   One woman whose son was killed, she recalled, told her she could
not face the murderer alone. Ms. Sandoval went to court and saw the
mother sitting alone with her two daughters, while the other side
was crowded with friends and family of the two accused. ``I began
to feel there definitely is something wrong,'' she said.
   In the spring of 1986, Ms. Sandoval and a few other mothers
formed the group. Initially, it was for victims' families. Then Ms.
Sandoval started hearing from gang members' mothers.
   One, she said, called and said: ```My son is one of them.' She
was crying. `Please help me. Do you know what it's like to go to
the railroad tracks and pick up your son half beaten to death? I
know he's going to die. I'm just waiting for the call ... or the
knock on the door.'''
   These mothers are now part of the organization, which claims
more than 700 members in three Illinois chapters. Plans have been
made to expand outside the state and spinoffs already have formed.
Funding comes from private donations.
   ``Mothers'' seeks to organize neighborhoods wracked by gang
violence. ``It's necessary they realize they have some control,''
she said. ``The communities have to stop passively accepting that
this is the way it is.''
   Cleaning up gang symbols, for example, she said, ``gives them
the sense they don't have to sit back and fold their hands.''
   Police estimate about 125 gangs with 12,000 members operate in
Chicago.
   Those who know Ms. Sandoval, a petite, blunt-spoken woman who's
an administrative assistant to an alderman, think she can make a
difference.
   ``What she offers people is a sign of hope and courage,'' said
Timothy McCormick, an ex-priest who once worked with Ms. Sandoval.
``She speaks out a lot of times when a lot of people won't. ...
Gangs live off others' fears and she challenges them. Many times
people want to hide in the shadows. Frances calls you to stand out
in the light.''
   ``She has that extra credibility and that urgency,'' said the
Rev. Larry Craig, who counseled Ms. Sandoval and whose church is
across the street from where Arthur was stabbed.
   ``No one can deny a bunch of mothers who've had their sons ...
or their daughters killed,'' he said. ``You can't make them wait in
the lobby. You can't push them away.''
   Ms. Sandoval, whose story will be told in a TV movie, said
Arthur's death has changed her.
   ``Before my son was murdered I never hated anybody in my life,''
she said. ``Now I hate (Lopez Rojo) for making him hate me. That is
an emotion no one should have to feel, an emotion I have no control
over.''
   But she also said she understands ``he wanted to belong. He,
too, was a victim of gangs.''
   Now, sometimes when she sees a smiling young man, she thinks of
Arthur. And, she said, ``when I'm overwhelmed and surrounded with
so much pain from other mothers ... I say, `Arthur pray for me.'''
   Arthur lifted her spirits when times got tough.
   ``He would always tell me you can do it, you can make it. He had
a lot of faith in everybody.''
   If he could see her now, she said, ``he would probably say,
`Mommy, you've come a long way. You are one gutsy lady.'''

   Mary Gall had a letter of recommendation from
George Bush, the FBI's stamp of approval to work as a White House
adviser and 20 years' experience volunteering with special-needs
kids.
   But when Gall applied to adopt a handicapped child six years
ago, 20 U.S. adoption agencies turned her down _ simply because she
was single.
   Tenacity, she soon discovered, is a requirement for anyone
joining the growing ranks of single women who want to adopt. Her
persistence paid off: She eventually adopted two children from
Guatemala.
   ``I'm thrilled those 20 agencies said no to me, because I got
the most wonderful kids,'' said Gall, 39, now assistant secretary
of human development services in the federal Department of Health
and Human Services. ``When you have beautiful children who love you
dearly, it's like sitting in the sun all the time.''
   While there were few single adoptive parents 10 years ago,
experts estimate they comprise 10 percent of those adopting today.
Local chapters of the national Committee for Single Adoptive
Parents, based in Maryland, are proliferating.
   Ninety percent of singles who adopt are women. Those familiar
with the type say it takes a special kind of woman to spend
thousands of dollars in adoption fees, sacrifice her social life
and put up with one rejection after another in the search for a
child to call her own.
   ``These are women who have a strong maternal instinct, who want
to be called mommy, for whom marriage is not immediately in the
cards and they are facing the proverbial biological clock,'' said
Jeffrey Rosenberg of the National Committee for Adoption.
   ``Generally they're between 35 and 45, professional women who
have established themselves. They're pretty comfortable with what
they want out of life, and are pretty stubborn to make this whole
decision,'' said Lea Wait, 45, of Bernardsville, N.J., an AT&amp;T
manager who adopted four children and runs a support group for
singles who adopt.
   Or, as Lindsay Gambini put it, ``I knew I wanted to be a mother.
I wasn't sure I wanted to be a wife.''
   Gambini, 39, manager of a Manhattan performing arts center,
adopted two children, but not without a struggle. First an adoption
in the Philippines fell through. She turned to the New York City
foster-care system but was turned down because she planned to hire
a babysitter during working hours. She was offered older children,
but thanks to a shortage of foster homes for infants and her own
persistence, she prevailed and got two baby boys, now 28 months and
15 months old.
   Both boys were abandoned by their birth mothers, victims of
grinding poverty and the drug epidemic that has nearly doubled the
city's foster care load since 1986.
   ``The elder one is a bit developmentally delayed and the younger
one had some drugs in his system,'' she said, adding a mother's
proud P.S.: ``They're cute as buttons.''
   Like other single women who adopt boys, Gambini says male
friends and relatives are happy to fill in as role models.
Otherwise, they improvise, as Mary Gall did when her son's soccer
team needed a coach: She bought a book about the game and committed
it to memory.
   Does adopting children dash all hopes of matrimony for the
single woman? Joy Duva, 41, who works in Washington, D.C., for the
Child Welfare League, echoed most single moms when she said that if
she ever does find the right man, ``that person would love me and
the baby.''
   Duva recently adopted a girl from Paraguay, forced, as was Gall,
to adopt overseas because domestic agencies favor couples. Much of
the difficulty single women face here stems from the fact that many
of them want healthy babies, and there's a lot of competition from
infertile couples. A lot of agencies, as Gall discovered, are even
reluctant to place older, special-needs children with singles.
   ``Traditionally the thinking was that families with a husband
and a wife were the best place for a child to be, particularly for
kids who never had that,'' said Phil Coltoff, who heads the
Children's Aid Society in New York City.
   But, he noted, ``there's been a rethinking of what single women
can offer.'' An independent career woman is a powerful role model
for any child, he said, adding that at least 10 percent of the
Children's Aid Society's foster mothers are single.
   Some agencies say certain children with special needs are
actually better off with single parents.
   ``If a kid has been in a group home and has learned to not
attach to people, it might be easier for him to bond with one
person than two,'' said Bob Diamond, head of Aid to Adoption of
Special Kids in Oakland, Calif., which makes 15 percent to 20
percent of its placements with single parents.
   Betsy Burch, who runs a national information and referral
organization called SPACE, for Single Parents for the Adoption of
Children Everywhere, from her home in Natick, Mass., says single
parents today can even adopt young, healthy American children, as
long as they are open to interracial adoption.
   ``I was teaching in Boston,'' Burch recalled. ``I had my
master's degree in urban education and found out there were many
black kids who needed placement. I decided to go ahead and do it.''
Burch, who is white, has adopted four black children.
   Coltoff of the Children's Aid Society also stressed the need for
flexibility in interracial adoptions.
   ``At any one time we have close to 500 (kids in foster care). If
we have one or two white kids, it's accidental,'' he said. ``Most
of the children in agencies like ours are black and Hispanic or
interracial.''
   Would legislation make it any easier for single adoptive
parents? Gall thinks not.
   ``You can't change public opinions through law,'' she said. ``If
you want to reach people and say single parent homes are good
homes, it's a matter of educating them to realize that families
don't all look alike.''

<HEAD>Farmers Should Complain Less, Says Japanese Writer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese editorial writer says some of his
country's farmers complain too much while others are more energetic
and have a positive attitude about their way of life.
   Yasuhiko Kishi of the Nihon Keizai Shimbum newspaper says
farmers' meetings are usually preceded with a comment that ``the
operating environment surrounding the agricultural sector is
difficult, or severe.''
   In other words, Japanese farmers apparently agree with many
others in the world: it's too dry or too wet, prices too low,
expenses too high. Not to mention the government, politicians,
television, radio, newspapers and assorted columnists.
   ``Now, while this is certainly true, the situation is not going
to change by moaning about how bad things are,'' Kishi wrote. ``It
must seem to those outside agriculture that farmers wallow in the
word difficult.''
   But Kishi is not exactly a latter-day H.L. Mencken, the acerbic
Baltimore writer who more than 60 years ago characterized the
American farmer as ``grasping, selfish and dishonest.''
   ``When the going is good for him, he robs the rest of us up to
the extreme limit of our endurance,'' Mencken wrote. ``When the
going is bad, he comes bawling for help out of the public till.''
   Kishi offers some suggestions for Japanese farmers, beginning
with a proposal to eliminate the word ``difficult'' from their
vocabulary.
   ``Perhaps it is best if those farmers who truly believe that
their future is bleak and that nothing can be done about it should
pack up and quit farming,'' Kishi said. ``I would like to see land
that is no longer used leased to those who would really like to
farm it.''
   Kishi told of one farmer, a Mr. U, who has used his region's
``supposedly poor, mountainous conditions to his best advantage by
leasing land at various altitudes and then rotating his vegetable
crops ``to exploit the different climates'' and weather that
prevail at the different levels.
   ``It is precisely this kind of bold response to adversity that
is required of farmers today,'' he said.
   Turning to another problem, Kishi said the biggest mistake in
Japan's basic agricultural law ``may possibly be its attempt to try
to foster independent management'' of farms, he said.
   ``Farmers who are serious about farming do not want to be
fostered,'' Kishi said. ``Those who do are not worth being fostered
in the first place. The role of an agricultural administration is
to create an environment in which enthusiastic and capable farmers
can perform to their fullest.''
   Kishi said more diversification is needed in Japanese
agriculture. No longer should there be ``one village, one specialty
product'' in Japan.
   ``This is an age when diversification is required of both
agricultural products and the farmers that grow them,'' he said.
``To meet consumers' changing tastes, supplies and suppliers must
also diversify. Take vegetables as an example: some customers feel
that vegetables are not fresh unless they still have the soil on
them; others are so busy that they want their produce ready-cut.
Agriculture must respond according to consumers' needs.''
   In Kishi's view, one of the disadvantages of Japan's food system
is that it has created large numbers of farmers who are unaware the
difficulties of marketing.
   ``All that farmers have to do is take their rice to the
agricultural cooperatives,'' he said. ``After that, they don't have
to do a thing; the rice is sold to the government for them at a set
price and the money is deposited into their accounts.''
   Kishi said it's only natural, therefore, that farmers quickly
forget about the concept of selling commodities. He said Mr. U
belives that management translates into sales.
   ``Why is it that ideas that sound like common sense in other
industries sound so radically new in the agricultural sector? I
would also like to add, at the risk of being misunderstood, that it
is a virtue for farmers to be shrewd and money conscious,'' he said.
   Another problem involves the entry of young people into farming.
Kishi said that in most of Japan there is a lament that farm
households have no one to take over, no youthful succesors.
   ``This is an age when those few that do choose farming do so
because they truly want to,'' Kishi said. ``Isn't it the case that
what has been lacking in Japan's agriculture is precisely the pride
that is shown by those who choose farming of their own accord?''
   Kishi's remarks were reprinted in the May issue of Japan Agrinfo
Newsletter, which is published by the Japan International
Agricultural Council, Tokyo.

<HEAD>Explorers From Six Countries Plan Trek Across Antarctica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   On the untouched expanse of the Arctic icecap it seemed a mirage
_ preposterous, incredible: ski tracks.
   Will Steger, leading the first unsupported dogsled trek to the
North Pole since Adm. Robert Peary's, saw the unmistakable evidence
of cross-country skis. He knew they could only be those of
Jean-Louis Etienne, a Frenchman who was about to become the first
man to ski alone to the pole.
   It was in April 1986, in a tent on the monotonous frozen
landscape, that the two adventurers sipped tea and dreamed of their
next quest: a multinational trek across Antarctica. After reaching
their destination, they began planning the Trans-Antarctica
Expedition, which is to begin Aug. 1.
   Their previous exploits were for the sheer joy of pitting man
against nature. This one would do that and more: draw attention to
threats against nature and to the need for international
cooperation in protecting Antarctica.
   Steger and Etienne enlisted scientists and explorers from the
Soviet Union, China, Japan and Great Britain for a seven-month,
4,000-mile trip. Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and
giant snow tractors, but this will be the first unmechanized
attempt.
   Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Research
Institute, a popular explorer and veteran of polar travel, is a
co-leader. The other members of the team are glaciologist Qin Dahe
of China; Geoff Somers, who has spent 42 months in Antarctica with
the British Antarctic Survey; and Keizo Funatsu of Japan, a former
economist who turned to dog-sledding and adventure.
   Somers will plot the trek's course; Funatsu is in charge of the
dogs.
   Steger, who in the past has picked his own teams, says he is
honored that the Soviet Union and China will be sending official
representatives. The four members from Western nations are not
formally backed by their governments.
   Steger recalled that when he asked if Boyarsky spoke English, a
Soviet official replied: ``In one year, he will speak English very
well.''
   ``A real interesting diplomatic challenge,'' Steger called it.
   Other international support includes the use of China's Great
Wall Station on King George Island as a staging point. New
Zealanders stationed at the Scott McArdle base donated 12 dogs
whose lineage can be traced to dogs owned by polar explorer Richard
Byrd. The Soviet Union provided an icebreaker to transport 15 tons
of food for the men and 36 dogs; the provisions were cached on the
route in November. The USSR also plans to send a military cargo
plane to pick up the team from its rendezvous at Steger's Minnesota
camp; the U.S. State Department, while not officially sanctioning
the trek, is expected to let the plane land.
   After refueling in Cuba, the team will fly to the Great Wall
Base, about 600 miles south of the tip of South America. The
expedition, which will set out in the middle of the Austral winter,
will at first follow known landmarks.
   ``We'll have maps for the first 1,500 miles. The last 2,500
miles there is virtually nothing. It's flat. There's nothing to
map,'' Steger said.
   They'll cross the Ellsworth Mountains and skirt Mt. Vinson, the
continent's highest spot at 16,860 feet. They'll visit three
American bases _ Palmer, Siple and Amundsen-Scott at the South
Pole, where they plan to celebrate Christmas.
   The next dot of civilization they'll aim for is the Soviet base
at Vostok, near the magnetic south pole. Vostok, the coldest place
on Earth, will serve as a base for a French documentary film crew
that will travel with the expedition for three weeks, and for the
team's pilot.
   By March, the trekkers should reach the Soviet base of Mirnyy on
the east coast, also known as Queen Mary Coast, ending the longest
possible traverse.
   They'll be picked up by the expedition ship, built in France
with a special aluminum hull designed to pop up and settle intact
on top of the ice rather than be trapped and crushed.
   So far, about 45 nations have signed television contracts with
the expedition. ABC has bought exclusive U.S. TV rights. ``We want
the world to know much, much more about Antarctica after our
expedition than it did before we set out,'' Steger said.
   The continent is roughly the shape of a bottle cap. It rises
sharply at the perimeter, then flattens out in a vast, high plateau
at an average elevation of 9,500 feet. Antarctica's 5.4 million
square miles is more than China and India combined. It has no
indigenous people, and wildlife is confined to the coast.
   A treaty signed in 1959 by a dozen nations, with additional
signatories in subsequent years, put all territorial claims on
Antarctica on hold, banned military activity and established
freedom of scientific inquiry.
   But many countries now have designs on the land for strategic,
political and even economic reasons _ some expect to find oil, coal
and mineral deposits under the ice. Some want to see the continent
cut into pie-shaped wedges, but Steger wants the people of the
world to demand that it be protected, intact.
   ``It sounds like a very lofty goal, but Antarctica is a going to
play a very important role in the future of the planet,'' he said.
   Planetary warming of just a few degrees could melt the polar ice
caps, raising sea level and flooding coastal areas, but Steger said
it's simplistic to worry about submerged cities. With 85 percent of
the planet's fresh water stored in the snow and ice of Antarctica,
a thaw would reduce the salinity of the oceans, change ocean
currents and wreak havoc with weather patterns.
   The other environmental nightmare awakening interest in
Antarctica is the discovery of a giant hole in the ozone layer
directly over the continent. Ozone screens the planet from excess
ultraviolet radiation.
   Scientists predict continued ozone depletion will increase skin
cancer, but such thinking is ``myopic,'' Steger said. Most
significantly, increased solar radiation could disrupt the
reproduction cycles of plankton, the microscopic oceanic plants and
animals that are the basis of the global food chain.
   These ominous changes are most apparent in Antarctica, making it
``like a canary in a mine,'' Steger said.
   The team will be under the ozone hole for about 40 days and 500
miles as they cross a 13,000-foot high plateau known as the Area of
Inaccessibility. It's the worst possible place on earth for
ultraviolet exposure.
   The team will carry a monitor and Boyarsky will record ozone
levels at regular intervals, the first cross-section of ozone
across the continent.
   Qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across
Antarctica, recording temperatures and oxygen content for a
geological history of the icecap.
   Etienne, a physician, will monitor cholesterol levels of the
team members, who will rely on the high-fat diet typical of
cultures in cold regions.
   But the experiments that can be done along the way are limited
by time and weight. The trekkers plan to travel 30 miles a day on
cross-country skis, and the three dogsleds can carry no more than
900 pounds of gear.
   Steger admits they won't attempt ``pure science'' but he hopes
the findings will contribute to the knowledge of this frontier.
``We need international cooperation. Solutions to environmental
problems must be global.''

<HEAD>Unique Treaty Keeps Antarctic Continent Neutral</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-EXP--Trans-Antarctica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The only piece of the planet that has never been divided or
conquered is Antarctica, a vast wilderness kept neutral by a unique
treaty.
   It has no boundaries other than its own ragged coastline.
   The Antarctic Treaty grew out of the 1957-58 International
Geophysical Year ``as an agreement to demilitarize, denuclearize
and basically depoliticize the continent,'' said Ray Arnaudo of the
State Department Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs.
   Of the 12 original signers, seven nations had territorial claims
on parts of Antarctica. ``The treaty solved that problem by putting
the claims on ice, so to speak,'' Arnaudo said. ``It's an agreement
to disagree.''
   The treaty, which came into force in 1961, reserves Antarctica
for peaceful purposes and guarantees freedom of research below
latitude 60 degrees south. It was written so that it could not be
changed for 30 years and thereafter remains in force unless a
signer calls for a conference to review a particular item.
   The earliest a signer could call for renegotiation is 1991, but
so far, no nation was indicated a desire to do so, Arnaudo said.
``We are quite happy with the treaty. It's not perfect, but it
works.
   ``Cynics could say it's successful because there's nothing to
fight about but ice. But I think anyplace where there is
interaction between countries, and the action is peaceful, it
deserves note.''
   There have been no military exercises, no nuclear weapons and no
conventional weapons on Antarctica for 30 years. The treaty also
prohibits nations from using the continent as a dump for
radioactive wastes.
   The original signers _ the United States, Soviet Union, Japan,
South Africa, Belgium, Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New
Zealand, Norway and Great Britain, the last six with territorial
claims _ have been joined by 27 other nations. The 39 nations
represent two-thirds of the world population.
   To deal with new issues, the treaty also calls for meetings
every other year. Participants include the dozen original signers
and 10 other signatory nations that conduct substantial scientific
research in Antarctica. The other 17 nations attend as observers.
   ``During the Falklands War the British and the Argentines sat at
the same table and agreed not to talk about the Maldive Islands.
Similarly, both North and South Korea are signers,'' Arnaudo said.
   At the 14 meetings since 1961, a number of measures have been
adopted to facilitate scientific research and protect the Antarctic
environment.
   Talks are under way regarding mineral resources. All parties to
the treaty have agreed to refrain from mining until an agreement is
reached.
   ``It's a remarkable place,'' Arnaudo said. ``It's a place where
people really do cooperate.''

<HEAD>With BC-EXP--Trans-Antarctica</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Here are some facts about Antarctica, the coldest place on
Earth:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Antarctica is so remote that the great explorers missed it
altogether during the Age of Discovery. Neither the Russian
Thaddeus von Bellinhausen, who discovered two coastal islands in
1819-20, nor American Nathaniel Palmer, who discovered what is now
called Palmer Peninsula in 1820, realized they were on the verge of
a new continent. In 1840, American Charles Wilkes sailed along
1,500 miles of coast and realized that he had found the seventh
continent.
   _In 1911, Norwegian Roald Amundsen was the first to reach the
South Pole. Eighteen years later, aviator Richard Byrd was the
first fly over it. British scientists led by Sir Vivian Ernest
Fuchs made the first land traverse of the continent in 1957-58 in
huge snow tractors.
   _Six thousand meteorites have been discovered on Antarctica,
more than those discovered in all the rest of the world.
   _The continent's human population averages 2,000 in the summer,
dwindling to about 800 in the winter. Only one other warm-blooded
animal remains during the winter, the emperor penguin. The female
emperor penguin lays one egg and returns to the warm sea for the
winter. The male fined space, Schneiderman said. ``Not only is the office
or
house a pain in the neck but the outdoors is beckoning.''
   Hormones also play a role, he said. The increase in sunlight
triggers the pineal gland at the base of the brain to release
hormones. Similar hormones in other animals and birds signal the
onset of mating season; the increased hours of sunlight also
stimulate migration in birds.
   In a sense, Schneiderman said, people have an urge to fly from
their responsibilities. ``I think most people can deal with it.
Most people won't come to the doctor for it. If they wound up
coming to the doctor for it, I would think they had some other
problem.''
   Staying indoors for some time also has been known to cause
physical problems. Headaches, cronic fatigue and irritability have
been linked to lower oxygen levels and indoor pollutants like molds
and formaldehyde odors.
   The cure to spring fever is to enjoy life, to stop and smell the
blooming roses, Schneiderman said. ``Getting out is good for
physical health and getting out is good for mental health.
   ``Running to and from the car doesn't count as getting outside.''
   Of course, he warned, everyone must be sure to fulfill their
obligations, and Lane said spring may even be the time for an
increase in labor.
   ``Spring is the time for an increase in labor, a time for
planning, a time to spend seed,'' he said, adding that spring also
can be a reawakening.
   ``Climb to the top of a large hill or a mountain with a good
view and think about the meaning of life.''

<HEAD>Tests Of ``Cool'' Laser in Heart Procedure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 65-year-old stockbroker had his coronary
arteries unblocked on a Wednesday and was playing golf three days
later, after doctors used a cool laser to vaporize fatty deposits
keeping blood from his heart.
   Albert Berkow is one of three patients who have had plaque
removed with the ``excimer'' laser at Philadelphia Heart Institute,
one of three hospitals performing clinical trials for the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
   ``The laser zaps the plaque,'' said institute director Dr.
Bernard L. Segal. The procedure is done through a catheter, without
open heart surgery.
   ``I felt only the anesthetic needle,'' said Berkow, who
underwent the experimental treatment Wednesday, April 26, and
played golf that weekend.
   The first phase of the clinical trial will establish the safety
and effectiveness of the procedure to permanantly open arteries in
the heart that are clogged by accumulate fatty deposits. South
Miami Hospital and Cedars-Sinai of Los Angeles, where the procedure
was invented, also are testing the laser.
   An excimer laser was first used to clear coronary arteries in
1987 at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, but that involved
open heart surgery.
   The laser transmits energy in pulses that last a billionth of a
second, much too fast for the body to feel heat, said Dr. Michael
S. Feldman, director of cardiology here. Unlike other lasers, which
cut or seal with heat, the cool laser vaporizes plaque without
damaging the arteries or leaving debris that could cause clotting
or a heart attack.
   The excimer laser is more controlled than the hot laser because
the energy is released in pulses and not a steady flow, said
cardiologist George Abela, of the University of Florida School of
Medicine in Gainesville, who helped pioneer lasers in blocked
arteries 10 years ago. Cardiologists will welcome the excimer laser
as a method of treating clogged coronary arteries, he said.
   Dr. Timothy Sanborn, of Mount Sinai's School of Medicine, said
researchers there will soon begin treatment with a similar laser.
That will involve balloon angioplasty, in which a tiny, inflated
balloon is used to force open the blood vessels. ``I think you're
going to see (the cool laser) as adding to the cardiologist's box
of tools,'' Sanborn said.
   For the 2{-hour procedure, a flexible catheter containing a
bundle of thin glass fibers is inserted into a blood vessel in the
groin and up the descending aorta until it reaches a blockage in
the heart. Once positioned, a laser beam vaporizes plaque and opens
the artery. If needed, balloon angioplasty can be used as a
follow-up procedure.
   ``Excimer laser angioplasty has the potential for becoming a
safer, faster, less traumatic and less expensive alternative to
open heart bypass surgery and balloon angioplasty,'' which are now
used on about 200,000 patients a year, Feldman said.
   If the FDA approves the laser for general use, Segal said the
treatment will cost about $1,500, about the same as balloon
angioplasty. Researchers hope the excimer laser procedure will
overcome the reccurrence of blockage which happens in about 30
percent of patients treated with balloon angioplasty.
   The researchers began their study by first using cool laser
techniques to remove plaque from the larger arteries in the leg.
   The excimer laser was designed by James Laudenslager, a chemical
physicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., for
NASA to measure ozone in the atmosphere. Doctors at Cedars-Sinai
began testing it on blocked arteries in September 1988 and have
been successful in about 75 percent of the 20 patients treated,
saod Dr. Juan Grundfest of Cedars-Sinai.
   ``It's a major revolution,'' Grundfest said, not only in the
treatment of blocked arteries, but in the fiber optics technology.
   ``Like any new device, it's not 100 percent successful,'' he
cautioned. Researchers are working on smaller catheters to reach
the smaller arteries and to improve the laser's ability to vaporize
larger deposits in the vessels. He expects the FDA to consider the
procedure for general use in late 1990.
   The Philadelphia institute, part of Presbyterian Medical Center,
will test the procedure on about 50 patients in the next four
months.
   Among other new methods being used to cut through clogged
arteries are: a shaver catheter, which works like a razor; a
rotablator, similar to a dentist's drill; and hot-tipped lasers, in
which the metal point is heated by the laser to burn away the fatty
deposits.

<HEAD>Pesticide May Stop Formosan `Super' Termite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new slow-acting pesticide
approved for indoor use against cockroaches and ants also may stop
the Formasan ``super'' termite that is spreading throughout the
South, a researcher says.
   ``The Formosan termite is so aggressive that it's pushing out
our native subterranean termites,'' said entomologist Nan-Yao Su,
with the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural
Sciences. ``If we don't stop this pest, it's possible the Formosan
termite could eventually replace our native species in the southern
part of the United States.''
   The pest has been found in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana,
Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. One colony may
contain 7 million termites and weigh 60 pounds, Su said. ``You
could say one of these termite colonies is like a 60-pound animal
eating about three pounds of wood every day.
   ``When you consider how aggressively this pest searches for
wood, cardboard and paper, it's easy to see why it's so
destructive.''
   With the beginning of swarming season, as many as 68,000 winged
termites may emerge from one nest at night in search of places
where they can mate and begin new colonies. Flights range as far as
1,500 feet from the nest.
   Worse yet, Su said, the pests are attracted by lights _
especially fluorescent lights. Warm, moist cracks or crevices in
buildings are ideal entry points, and the Formosan termite can
infest buildings from the top floor downward without the ground
connection needed by domestic termites.
   The key to controlling the pest is to destroy the underground
colonies, he said. Large quantities of pesticide beneath buildings
may keep the pest out, but won't destroy nests that could be as far
as 600 feet away.
   Termites are very sensitive to chemicals and seal off their
colonies to avoid them. The new chemical, sulfluramid, is effective
at concentrations so low termites don't detect it, Su said. A few
grams of the compound produced by Griffin Corp. of Valdosta, Ga.,
should be enough to destroy an entire colony.
   Field tests are set for this summer, he said.

<HEAD>Experimental Grass Gets By With Little Irrigation</HEAD>

   FX 33 may sound like a new jet fighter,
but its use is strictly on the ground. It's a type of grass that
needs so little water that a plot last sprinkled in January is
still lush and green.
   ``It offers a significant advantage in drought resistance,''
said Phil Busey, a University of Florida researcher, ``but we're
still not sure how it will do with very cold weather, shade and
some types of disease.''
   FX 33 looks much like Floratam, developed by the university 14
years ago, Busey said. ``We've had both of them in Fort Lauderdale
test plots for 14 months now without irrigation, and the Floratam
has all but died out.''
   It's not that FX 33 doesn't need water _ it's the ability to use
water efficiently that counts. FX 33 has roots extending up to five
feet into the soil, enough to tap into the shallow aquifer beneath
much of central Florida.
   Spring droughts have forced bans on water usage during most of
the daylight hours in central and southern Florida.
   However, Busey suspects FX 33 has no tolerance for temperatures
much below 20 degrees, and might be susceptible to a disease called
gray leaf spot. It's also still unclear how the grass does in
prolonged shade.
   Homeowners need not line up at the garden store just yet, since
more tests will preclude commercial production until perhaps the
summer of 1991.

<HEAD>WPP Raises Offer For Ogilvy; Stock Price Goes Above Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover speculators are betting that WPP Group
PLC's new $50-a-share purchase offer for Ogilvy Group Inc. will not
be enough to capture the American advertising company.
   The WPP offer puts a value of roughly $750 million on Ogilvy,
the world's fifth-largest advertising concern based on 1988
billings. WPP, owner of the U.S. agency J. Walter Thompson, ranks
third.
   Together the companies would roughly tie Britain's Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi for honors as the world's biggest advertising group.
   WPP said Monday it was stepping up from its initial offer of $45
a share ``in order to avoid unnecessary and potentially unsettling
delay in the negotiation of a friendly transaction.''
   Arbitragers bid Ogilvy's stock up $2.12{ a share in
over-the-counter trading on Monday to $52 a share, higher than the
offer made public by Britain's WPP.
   The speculators apparently believed WPP would raise its offer
again or that a debt-financed group, possibly led by management,
would buy the company from shareholders at more than $50 a share,
analysts said.
   It is less likely that another advertising company will emerge
as a bidder, because the price already is more than 50 percent
above what the market considered Ogilvy worth before the bidding
began, said James D. Dougherty, an analyst at County NatWest USA.
   Ogilvy traded as low as $24 a share late last year. It rose to
the low $30s, partly on takeover speculation, before the initial
WPP offer, which was confirmed May 1.
   ``I frankly have a lot of problem finding economic sense at this
price. At $45, maybe,'' Dougherty said.
   Ogilvy says it can serve its clients better by remaining
independent.
   A spokeswoman, Joelle Frank, said Monday Ogilvy had received
many other expressions of interest but would not say if it had
negotiated with anyone.
   She also declined to confirm a report in The Sunday Times of
London that two American investment firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&amp; Co. and Wesray Capital Corp., had approached Ogilvy with offers
higher than WPP's initial bid.
   A spokesman for Kohlberg declined to comment on the report,
while a spokesman for Wesray did not immediately return a phone
call.
   Although WPP wants a friendly deal, the London-based company has
not ruled out taking its offer directly to Ogilvy shareholders with
a hostile tender offer or proxy fight.
   A hostile takeover would not necessarily cripple Ogilvy by
prompting mass defections, as has happened in certain other
takeovers, Dougherty said.
   ``My suspicion is that there would be a few defections at the
very top, but the worker bees who actually would get the work out
for the clients would stay,'' he said.
   In addition to J. Walter Thompson, WPP owns the Hill &amp; Knowlton
public relations agency. Other Ogilvy's properties include Ogilvy &amp;
Mather Worldwide advertising and Scali, McCable, Sloves advertising.
   Based on Ogilvy's 14.7 million shares outstanding, a $50-a-share
buyout would total $735 million. Another 1.3 million shares could
be issued through the exercise of stock options, but those would
cost less than $50 apiece for an acquirer because the owner would
have to put up the exercise price.
   Ogilvy also has about $40 million in long-term debt that a buyer
would have to assume.

   Two central figures in criminal and civil
investigations of New York's commodity markets paid $135,000 in
1985 to settle charges of collaborating in illegal trades,
officials said.
   Meanwhile, federal officials declined to comment Monday on
published reports that criminal subpoenas had been issued to
traders in connection with a raid last week on the markets.
   The investigations are said to focus on Preston H. Semel, who
runs a brokerage trading in gold, silver and other commodities, and
Mark B. Fisher, an independent trader who runs an oil futures trade
processing firm.
   Federal agents last Thursday executed criminal search warrants
at Fisher's exchange offices, while officials from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission subpoenaed four exchanges and about 26
individual traders for information.
   The investigations reportedly focus on allegations of a variety
of trading practices violations, including pre-arranged trades,
using advanced knowledge of customer trades to trade for personal
accounts and conducting trades in order to skirt tax obligations.
   Fisher and Semel were linked in a 1985 settlement of charges
brought by the Commodity Exchange, or Comex, of alleged trading
abuses committed in 1983, Comex spokesman Robert McGrath said.
   The two were charged with scheming along with a third trader to
conduct pre-arranged trading and improper dual trading, in which
trades are made for both customer and personal accounts.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Fisher paid the exchange a
$60,000 fine, Semel paid $75,000 and was suspended two months, and
Sergio Cardello, a partner of Semel's, paid $125,000 and lost his
Comex membership seat, according to exchange records.
   A market source said Monday that Semel, 39, currently is the
subject of an internal Comex investigation for irregular trading
that involves other individuals.
   Semel in 1985 also paid a $5,000 civil penalty to settle charges
of conducting so-called ``wash sales'' in which contracts are
bought in identical amounts to create bogus losses for tax purposes
or to affect the price of a commodity, a CFTC spokeswoman said.
   That violation was included in charges against several other
firms and traders and involved gold and silver futures on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   A person answering the phone at Semel &amp; Co. said neither Semel
nor his attorney would be available for comment.
   An attorney for Fisher said the trader had not received a
criminal subpoena or been notified by the government that he is a
target. U.S. Postal Service inspectors executing criminal search
warrants seized documents from Fisher's World Trade Center offices
Thursday.
   Fisher has received a civil subpoena as part of the CFTC probe,
sources said.
   A subpoena is a formal request for information. It does not
carry any charge or imply guilt.
   Fisher and two other traders who have been subpoenaed in the
civil case attended the University of Pennsylvania in the early
1980s and were known to be personally acquainted.
   Mark B. Dickstein, a 1980 Penn graduate who has his own trading
firm, issued a statement Monday that he had received a CFTC
subpoena seeking documents dealing with two months of transactions
but was not under investigation, ``and neither I nor my counsel
believe that I am a target of any CFTC investigation.''
   A spokesman for Dickstein said the trader had not received a
criminal subpoena.
   Craig W. Effron, a 1981 Penn graduate and gold trader who also
has received a civil subpoena, declined to comment Monday.
   Dickstein and Effron both have been disciplined by Comex in the
past. Dickstein paid $40,000 to settle charges of a variety of
trading abuses in November 1986; Effron paid $7,000 in September
1986 and $9,000 in August 1988 to settle trading misconduct charges.
   In addition to Comex, subpoenaed exchanges were the New York
Mercantile Exchange; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; and the
Cotton Exchange.
   A separate Justice Department investigation of Chicago's
commodities markets, the nation's largest, came to light in January
but is not connected to the New York probe.

<HEAD>Regulatory Panel Grants Limited Extension to Minorco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it would grant South
African-controlled Minorco SA a limited extension in its hostile
$5.8 billion bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   The Panel on Takeovers and Mergers also ordered Gold Fields to
discontinue its court proceedings against Minorco unless its
shareholders approve such actions at a May 30 meeting.
   The acquisition of the British gold mining group would be
Britain's largest takeover ever.
   The takeover panel said it favored extending the timetable for
the bid because of ongoing litigation in the United States.
   Under the panel's ruling, the $25.30-a-share offer is to expire
June 7. It would have technically expired April 26.
   Minorco, which already held a 29.9 percent stake in Gold Fields,
announced April 26 that enough shareholders had accepted its offer
to give it a stake of nearly 55 percent in Gold Fields. But U.S.
litigation arising from antitrust claims has prevented Minorco from
actually taking its stake in Gold Fields above 30 percent.
   U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp. is 49 percent owned by Gold
Fields and is a party to the litigation against Minorco.
   Graham Williams, a spokesman for Gold Fields, said the company
had no immediate comment on the panel's ruling Tuesday.
   Luxembourg-based Minorco is 60 percent controlled by Anglo
American Corp. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and
diamond mining interests of the South African Oppenheimer family.
   Minorco's bid was unveiled in September and twice sweetened. It
currently includes half a Minorco share and $19.62 in cash for each
Gold Fields share.

<HEAD>Varity Agrees to Buy Fruehauf's Last Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Varity Corp., which has tried to buy Fruehauf
Corp. three times since last fall, finally succeeded with an offer
worth an estimated $650 million in cash, stock and notes.
   Fruehauf and Toronto-based Varity said Monday they signed an
agreement under which Varity will pay $66 million in cash and $430
million in notes and issue new stock for the Kelsey-Hayes
automotive products division of Fruehauf.
   Kelsey-Hayes supplies wheels and anti-lock brakes and is the
last of Fruehauf's 75-year-old corporate empire. Fruehauf put
itself up for sale last autumn and has since sold off its
tractor-trailer and marine operations.
   Varity, formerly Massey-Ferguson, has pursued the profitable
Kelsey-Hayes unit for the last eight months. If the sale goes
through, Fruehauf said it would liquidate its assets, although the
nameplate will continue to appear on its trailers.
   Under terms of the deal, each share of Fruehauf common stock
would be converted into one share of newly issued Varity stock. At
Monday's prices, the new stock would be worth about $145 million.
   The 6,700 Kelsey-Hayes workers worldwide would not be affected
immediately, Varity spokesman Jack Nowling said. He said Varity
will delay any moves until the sale is completed in four or five
months, pending approval of Fruehauf shareholders and bondholders.
   Wilbur Ross, a spokesman for the creditors, said even though
creditors will be paid only 89 cents for each dollar, the deal is
good because Fruehauf's shaky status had meant the debt was worth
only 70 cents per dollar on the open market.
   Financial problems at Fruehauf, builder of half of all trailers
on the highways in the 1950s, date to the 1970s, when deregulation
forced truckers to slash their rates.
   The company's financial difficulties were compounded in 1986
when its managers borrowed $1.5 billion to buy the company and fend
off a takeover. Despite cost-cutting measures, it never recovered
from the debt burden and began putting divisions up for sale.
   In March, Fruehauf sold its unprofitable truck division for $232
million to Terex Corp., based in Green Bay, Wis.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Like diapers, razors, and even wristwatches,
contact lenses have joined the growing ranks of throwaway items.
Cheaper lenses now can be worn for a week or two and tossed in the
trash. If they hurt your eye, just take them out and put in a new
pair. No more expensive cleaning solutions. No more tender-loving

   Soft contact lenses, those floppy pieces
of plastic that help people see without wearing eyeglasses, have
reached a popular American culture benchmark. They've become
disposable.
   That could mean a lot of changes involving the way people view
the little lenses that make things clearer for 23 million Americans.
   Hundreds of thousands of people are already wearing disposable
lenses, even though up to now they've been available only on a
limited basis. Eye doctors are flocking to lectures about them, and
consumers are wondering what's going on.
   ``They've really captured the interest of the American public,''
says Dr. Scott MacRae, an ophthalmologist from Portland, Ore., who
is also a consultant to the Food and Drug Administration for
ophthalmic devices.
   He speaks from experience. He wears a disposable lens in his
right eye.
   ``I don't think we've ever seen anything, in my experience, that
gained this kind of acceptance,'' says Hal Johnson, president of
professional products at Bausch &amp; Lomb, the nation's leading seller
of contact lenses. ``We're in high gear. And I mean high gear.''
   It hasn't been too long ago that basketball games were stopped
while players scoured the floor for a missing contact lens. Most
people still coddle and clean their lenses, treating them like tiny
treasures.
   They even buy insurance policies to protect them from loss or
damage.
   Now, along come some lenses that can be worn for a week or two
and tossed in the trash. If they hurt your eye, just take them out
and put in a new pair. No more expensive cleaning solutions. No
more tender-loving care.
   Is ``wear 'em and toss 'em'' the wave of the future?
   Probably not, say officials at Bausch &amp; Lomb and other eye care
experts.
   The main reason is that most of the most of the lenses available
can only be worn by patients who are nearsighted. Another negative
factor is the cost _ between $300 and $500 per year.
   Disposable contacts were introduced in the United States in July
1987 by Vistakon Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which up
until March was the only maker of a disposable lens with national
distribution. Vistakon's throwaway lenses are called Accuvue.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb started selling disposable contacts nationally in
March and CIBA Vision, the second-leading maker, has started
selling disposable contacts in California that can be worn by both
nearsighted and farsighted people.
   CIBA's Kim Little says lenses, called NewVues, should be
available nationally later this year.
   Johnson says Bausch &amp; Lomb expects that between 10 percent and
20 percent of all contact lens wearers in the country will switch
to disposable lenses.
   But even that small percentage will have astounding business
implications for the contact lens industry.
   Consider that a patient who normally would have walked into an
optometrist's office and left with a new pair of lenses could now
walk away with u to 52 pairs of lenses.
   The average disposable customer, using either a one-week or a
two-week replacement schedule, will use 39 pairs of lenses a year.
   That means that instead of selling four million lenses a year to
the roughly 2 million disposable customers, eye doctors will sell
156 million lenses a year.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb is expanding its three largest contact lens
manufacturing plants, including the renovation of an area in
Rochester, roughly the size of two football fields, that will be
devoted to the company's SeeQuence line of disposable lenses.
   This flurry of activity is all possible because Bausch &amp; Lomb
and Vistakon have been able to dramatically lower the cost of
making a contact lens.
   Irving Aarons, a stock analyst for Arthur D. Little in
Cambridge, Mass., estimates that Bausch &amp; Lomb can make a
disposable lens for less than $1, maybe as low as 75 cents. It
sells two lenses for $5 to practitioners, who turn around and sell
them for $7 to $10.

<TEXT>
   The company's standard lens costs about $1.30 to make and is
sold for between $15 to $30, Aarons says. Practitioners will sell
each of those lenses for $40 to $50.
   ``They're selling a smaller number of lenses for a wider margin
now. But with disposables, they'll be selling a huge number of
lenses for a smaller margin,'' Aarons says.
   More important than the business implications, disposable
contact lenses are going to play a key role in ushering in a whole
new era in eye care among the many wearers of contact lenses in the
United States.
   ``One of the things that we're seeing is that with the
introduction of disposable lenses people are understanding that
frequent lens replacement is a viable option,'' says David Archer,
director of marketing for Bausch &amp; Lomb's professional products
division.
   The average contact lens wearer replaces one lens a year, Archer
says, and usually suffers some discomfort or some difficulty with a
lens before deciding to replace it.
   If people begin to think that contact lenses are expendable, he
says, they will be more likely to replace them, as often as every
week or at least once a year.
   The only real difference between a daily-wear soft contact lens
and a disposable lens is the recommended wearing time. Both are
made of flexible plastic.
   Disposable lenses and extended-wear lenses are slightly thinner
than daily-wear lenses, making them slightly more comfortable but
slightly less durable.
   The label on the disposable lens container notes the lenses are
only FDA approved for a maximum of two weeks at a time. Doctors
were concerned that people wouldn't comply with the recommended
wearing time, but so far studies are indicating that the compliance
rate is very high.
   As far as cost, Bausch &amp; Lomb has streamlined the technique used
to make a contact lens and can now manufacture lenses 70 percent
faster than several years ago. The increased volume has allowed the
price to fall.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb also offers a frequent lens replacement program
that allows patients to get new lenses at different intervals, such
as once a month or once every three months, and requires them to
stick the discarded lenses on a card and mail them back to the
company to insure compliance.
   Archer likens it to the dental care industry's effort that
started three decades ago to promote the benefits of regular
checkups and teeth cleaning to prevent tooth decay.
   Dr. Augustus Falcone, a Rochester optometrist who specializes in
contact lenses, agrees with Archer.
   ``If you tell a patient about being able to change lenses every
week, it starts the negotiation,'' Falcone says. ``OK, you don't
want to change your lenses every week. How about every month? How
about every three months? Whatever they pick is better than what
they have now.''
   Studies have shown that frequent replacement of lenses _ at
intervals suggested by eye doctors _ can greatly reduce the risk of
getting a severe eye injury from a contact lens, MacRae says.
   ``If disposable lenses get people to change their lenses more
often, then they've probably done a good thing,'' he says.
   But MacRae, and many other eye doctors, still are not convinced
that extended-wear contact lenses, like disposable contacts, are
completely safe, no matter how often you replace them.
   He said a new study of 22,000 extended-wear contact lens wearers
indicates that they are three to five times more likely to suffer a
serious eye injury than someone who takes his lenses out at night.
   ``We don't know why this is, but my hunch is that an
extended-wear user doesn't get enough oxygen to the cornea and this
can cause problems,'' MacRae says.
   Falcone learned about the disposability of contact lenses nine
years ago when professional golfer Calvin Peete came to him in the
middle of a golf tournament in Rochester because he had torn a
contact lens.
   ``He could have won $24,000 and he had to withdraw because of a
little piece of plastic,'' Falcone says. ``I mean, holy mackerel,
what's a lens. So I started sending him fistfuls of lenses.''

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco To Sell Five European Foods Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. said Tuesday it plans to auction
five European foods businesses as part of an effort to reduce debt
following the $24.53 billion takeover by the investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   The businesses include the British biscuits business of Nabisco
and two British potato chip and snacks makers, Walker's Crisps and
Smiths Crisps.
   The company said it also intends to sell its French cookie and
specialty pastries maker, Belin Group, and Saiwa, an Italian
biscuit and snacks maker.
   RJR Nabisco, which intends to reduce debt by $5.5 billion
through sales of some subsidiaries, said it already has been
approached by numerous firms about the European businesses.
   Together, the five units had pretax profit of $137 million on
sales of $1.2 billion in 1988.
   ``Each of these businesses is highly attractive,'' R.E. Glover,
president of the International Nabisco Brands division, said in a
statement.

<HEAD>Say Regional Holding Companies Consider Bank Bids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two regional banking companies have
joined a list of firms that are considering submitting bids to buy
the 20 former MCorp banks now controlled by federal regulators, a
newspaper reported.
   Sources quoted by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in Tuesday
editions said Barnett Banks Inc. and Banc One Corp. are working
independently on possible bids and are examining the MCorp banks'
financial records.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized 20 of the 25 banks
owned by MCorp in March, one of the biggest federal takeovers of a
troubled banking company. The action came after three MCorp
bondholders sought to have MCorp's assets sold in an involuntary
bankruptcy liquidation to pay off debts.
   The 20 banks, operated under the umbrella of Deposit Insurance
Bridge Bank, were put up for sale recently by the regulators.
   Barnett Banks, based in Jacksonville, Fla., had total assets of
$25.7 billion on Dec. 31 and reported net income of $226 million in
1988, a 20-percent rise from its 1987 performance.
   Barnett has 546 banking offices in Florida and Georgia.
Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One, with total year-end assets of $25.3
billion, reported net income of $340 million last year and has 566
banking offices in Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin.
   Officials of Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank confirmed Monday that
as many as three prospective bidders were reviewing its books and
records and meeting with selected bank executives.
   ``The bank has arranged separate areas to accommodate
simultaneous due diligence reviews by up to three prospective
bidders,'' the bridge bank said in a statement.
   But the institution would not say whether Barnett and Banc One
were among firms conducting the on-site examination.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a New York investment firm that
specializes in buying other companies with borrowed money, began
its second on-site audit last week.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Says Pillsbury Discriminated Against Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of black employees is suing the
Pillsbury Co., accusing the food conglomerate of routinely engaging
in race discrimination in hiring, promoting, compensating and
disciplining black workers.
   The complaint was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in
Minneapolis on behalf of eight Pillsbury employees and one person
who applied for but failed to get a job with the company. A judge
will rule in about six months whether to certify the suit a class
action, representing present and former black employees.
   Paul Sprenger, the attorney representing the nine plaintiffs,
said their experiences at the company indicate widespread racist
employment practices.
   ``Blacks are routinely put in the slow track as opposed to the
fast track and reach the level beyond which they can't go and
become frustrated,'' Sprenger said.
   The complaint says one of the nine plaintiffs, Freida Hodges of
Minneapolis, applied for a job at Pillsbury but was rejected
because of her race. The other eight, all employees, experienced
discrimination in promotions, unfair performance evaluations and
harassment, the suit says.
   Pillsbury, which was acquired in January by Grand Metropolitan
PLC of London, said Monday that it has carefully reviewed the
allegations in the complaint and concluded that they have no basis
in fact.
   ``Most of the allegations involve alleged incidents which took
place before Grand Metropolitan acquired Pillsbury,'' the company
said. ``Pillsbury and Grand Met are strongly committed to the
principle of equal employment opportunities for all employees and
prospective employees.''
   Sprenger said he began investigating the case two years ago. He
said that during that time he talked to the company in an effort to
reach a settlement before filing a complaint, but was unsuccessful.
   ``Part of the problem was getting a management decision because
of the recent takeover,'' he said.
   Sprenger is nationally known for his successful litigation in
employment discrimination. He has participated in many of the major
class-action employment cases in Minnesota: Rajender vs. the
University of Minnesota, National Organization for Women vs. the 3M
Co., and Holden et al. vs. Burlington Northern.
   ``It is an easy case to resolve if a serious commitment to
future hiring and promotion practices can be addressed,'' he said.
   The complaint included a copy of a list of racist jokes that was
``freely circulated and condoned by Pillsbury management
employees.'' Sprenger said one of the plaintiffs, Diana Sanders, a
secretary who was terminated in March in company-wide layoffs,
obtained the list from upper-level managers.
   The complaint filed Monday is the second class action
race-discrimination complaint leveled at the company. In 1974 a
black woman charged race and sex discrimination after she was fired
from her management-level job. The case wound its way up to the
Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before it was settled in 1984
out of court.
   Sprenger said that because the settlement did not require
Pillsbury to change its employment and promotion practices, it has
perpetuated race discrimination.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities have fallen in the latest auction to the lowest level in
more than three months.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $6.8 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.41 percent, down
from 8.64 percent last week. Another $6.8 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.39 percent, down
from 8.64 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since Jan. 30 when three-month bills
sold for 8.33 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.39 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.71 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,787.40 and 8.88 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,575.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 9.16
percent last week, down from 9.22 percent the previous week.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting improved growing conditions in some major U.S.
crop-producing areas.
   The soybean market opened higher amid indications of Soviet
buying on the cash market but prices quickly turned lower in
reaction to overnight showers in the Midwest.
   The improved soil moisture in eastern Iowa and northwestern
Illinois also pressured corn prices.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast issued after
Monday's close called for normal precipitation early next week in
the Midwest and the Great Plains, which added to the bearish
sentiment in all the grain and soybean markets.
   Wheat traders are growing more cautious as they establish
positions ahead of the Agriculture Department's winter wheat crop
estimate on Thursday.
   In early trading, wheat was 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.32 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
2 cents lower with May at $2.77} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 3
cents lower wiith May at $1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 2} cents to
6{ cents lower with May at $7.58 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .50 cent higher wiith June at 72.65
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .40 cent higher with
May at 77.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent to .18 cent
higher wiith June at 47.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.38 cent to 1 cent higher with May at 32.75 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Monday while pork futures
advanced.

<HEAD>Does Anyone Know The Price Anymore?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Does anyone know the price anymore _ of an
automobile, a fast-food meal, an airplane ticket, a bag of lawn
fertilizer or a dozen other products that might come to mind?
   Pricing no longer is simple and straightforward. It is tricky,
confusing, surprising, exasperating and inexplicable, to mention a
few characteristics. Someone with imagination could make a list
that would gird the globe.
   Retailer discounts, manufacturer discounts, discount-option
packages, sales, rebates, below-cost financing, fees, specials,
exceptions and exemptions produce a challenge to which few buyers
are equal.
   The time of day on which you make your phone calls can mean full
price or a 65 percent discount, but that isn't the only thing that
complicates your phone bill. Do you own your phone or do you rent?
Do you own or rent the jacks?
   The day of the week on which you travel by air can mean paying
half-price or regular price. But the discount might be available
only if you fly through a certain city on the way to your
destination...if there is room on the flight.
   Do you know how interest is assessed on your credit card or
whether you pay an annual service fee? Do you know the rate _ or
how much it has changed in the past few months? Bluntly speaking,
do you know what your card costs?
   The difficulty in pricing was illustrated in recent weeks when
General Motors and Ford raised prices on options, but not the basic
prices of all cars. The effect is to further complicate attempts to
assess prices.
   GM, for example, increased by $10 each the prices of power
windows, power door locks and cruise control. It raised air
conditioning $20 and automatic transmissions $25. The result:
Higher car costs no matter what they say.
   Ford increased prices of power door locks, power windows, power
mirrors and cruise control by $8, but it retained discount-option
packages, in which option items have a lower total price when
purchased together rather than separately.
   Partly as a consequence of such complicated pricing, it becomes
nearly impossible to estimate the price of an automobile from the
prices advertised, which often are for bare-bones vehicles. Price
tags become come-ons.
   It happens in fast-food restaurants too. The big sign advertises
a juicy hamburger with lettuce and tomato for $1.99, but when the
bill comes it adds up to more than $4. The cheese costs 75 cents,
the side salad about the same. The small cola, tea or coffee costs
70 cents and sometimes more than $1.
   Over at the local lending institution, meanwhile, they're
pushing low-cost mortgages, but are points included? At the real
estate office they offer help in getting a mortgage, but do they
mention they might take a fee for doing so?
   So you buy the house and get to work on the lawn. At the garden
store they're having their spring sale, and that means fertilizer
rebates. Let's see: There's the regular price, the retailer
discount and the manufacturer's rebate, which you claim by mail
with proof of purchase and a sales ticket. Many forget to do so.
   You don't go overboard on landscaping because you know that real
estate taxes soon will be due. You thought you knew the exact tax
down to the penny _ until they reassessed the town. They raised
assessments 9.3 percent but lowered the mill rate 6.2 percent, so
that leaves you owing _ an indeterminate sum.

   Pan Am Corp. announced today it is considering
making an offer for NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines,
which is the target of several takeover suitors.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett made the surprise announcement
to shareholders at the financially troubled airline's annual
meeting in Washington.
   He said Pan Am's move is in response to NWA's general request
for such proposals. NWA already has received a $2.7 billion
takeover offer from investor Marvin Davis, and the airline's unions
have said they also are interested in possibly buying the carrier.
   A marriage of Pan Am and Northwest would create one of the most
far-reaching airlines, with routes worldwide, and further
consolidate the landscape of the deregulated U.S. airline industry.
   NWA didn't specifically approach Pan Am to make an offer, Pan Am
spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.
   Plaskett said Pan Am has retained Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. and Airlie Group LP as financial advisers but did not disclose
any possible details of a bid for NWA.
   Prudential-Bache is considering providing ``very significant''
new equity for Pan Am to acquire NWA and anticipates arranging the
remaining financing if Pan Am actually makes a bid, he said.
   Plaskett told airline analysts several months ago that Pan Am
probably would have difficulty ensuring its financial survival
without merging with another carrier.
   ``The linkage of two airlines with virtually no overlapping
routes into a single global carrier would create a formidable U.S.
challenger to the rapidly expanding foreign mega-carriers,''
Plaskett told the shareholders.
   ``The combination would be especially significant given the
heritage and reservoir of international experience which the
employees of the two carriers contribute.
   ``The recent developments at NWA have created a unique
opportunity to pursue an idea that makes good business sense and
one that will position Pan Am and Northwest to grow together into a
world leader in international aviation.
   ``Pan Am and its financial advisors believe that the business
economics of the combined entities could easily support a fully
financed cash offer at an attractive price. There are still a
number of complex issues to examine, including transitional labor
agreements and the specific terms of an offer, before we will
proceed with a bid.''
   Northwest's Pacific routes to the Orient and Europe would
dovetail with Pan Am's large international operations that are
strong in Atlantic routes and to Latin America.
   Trading in shares of both companies was halted shortly before
the announcement. After it resumed Pan Am rose 25 cents a share to
$5.00 on the New York Stock Exchange, and NWA rose 62{ cents a
share to $105.12{.
   Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, generally is
considered one of the most profitable. Pan Am, on the other hand,
has been racked by losses for several years and has asked its
unions to take pay cuts.
   Pan Am, the eighth-largest, recently reported that its
first-quarter loss widened to $151.1 million from $83.3 million a
year earlier, due in part to a decline in business after the
bombing of its Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December.
   Pan Am reported $733.5 million in revenue for the first three
months of 1989, down from $763.9 million a year earlier.
   NWA, by contrast, reported its largest first-quarter profit of
the decade.
   First-quarter earnings were $12.6 million, or 43 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $43.5 million in the first quarter of
1988.
   NWA's revenue in the quarter jumped 19.3 percent to $1.48
billion from $1.24 billion a year earlier.
   Kurt Rivard, an airline analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. in
Minneapolis, said a merger of the two carriers is plausible.
   ``They do make a very interesting fit,'' he said. ``There is not
much overlap in the domestic routes and while Northwest is strong
in the Pacific, Pan Am is fairly significant elsewhere in the world.
   ``An acquisition or a merger for Northwest from a company point
of view makes a lot of sense,'' he said. ``They're very
compatible.''
   Rivard said there may be some accounting benefits in Pan Am, the
smaller of the two, acquiring Northwest. He said there could be tax
losses at Pan Am that could be carried forward.

   The stock market was flat to lower in lackluster

   Declining issues outpaced advancers by about 10 to 9 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 647 issues down, 580 up and 586 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 71.80 million shares.
   Analysts said the market remained cautious in anticipation of
Friday's government report on producer prices, which will provide
another gauge of inflation.
   ``There's nothing going on. The main reason is this is a market
that is totally enthralled by the next economic report,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of the investment firm A.G.

   Analysts said the producer price index has particular
significance for the market after last week's unemployment report,
which provided mixed signals.
   Unemployment rose 0.3 percentage point to 5.3 percent in April,
indicating a slowdown in economic growth. But the market focused on
the part of the report showing hourly earnings rose seven cents,
suggesting inflation might still be a problem.
   Traders said today's market could benefit if the three-part
Treasury borrowing produces favorable results. Bond prices were

   Texaco Inc. stockholders, meeting for the first
time since the oil giant began a post-bankruptcy restructuring,
were told today the company has bounced back with a vengeance.
   ``Since last year, we have gone from a period of promise to a
period of heightened performance,'' said James W. Kinnear, Texaco's
president and chief executive officer.
   Kinnear and Texaco Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane Jr. told the
annual meeting the company is ready to reclaim its place as an
industry leader because of the restructuring.
   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, asked a federal
bankruptcy court in 1987 to protect it from creditors. The move
followed a $10.3 billion judgment won against Texaco by Pennzoil
Co., which charged Texaco with blocking Pennzoil's plans to acquire
Getty Oil Co.
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., emerged from Chapter 11
last year and launched a restructuring program that included the
projected sale of more than $5 billion in operating assets.
   Texaco's first quarter 1989 net income was $1.4 million.
   ``There are clear signs that we're on the right path,'' DeCrane
said.
   Shareholders today voted in favor of a number of items,
including the election of five board members, two special dividends
totaling about $2 billion and a new ``poison pill'' plan designed
to thwart unwanted takeover attempts.
   The shareholders defeated two separate proposals aimed at
getting the company to curtail operations in South Africa and also
rejected a proposal to make proxy voting confidential.
   Company officials were still counting late votes on the
proposals today, keeping final tallies from being made available
immediately.

<TEXT>
   A mammoth Soviet vessel helping clean up
the Alaskan oil spill can't handle the hardened, taffylike crude
and is being sent home, authorities said today.
   The high-tech, 425-foot Vaydaghubsky, which has been under a
$15,000-a-day, monthlong Exxon contract to skim the oil spilled
March 24, did not have its contract renewed.
   Exxon and state officials said the ship had difficulty
processing the ``mousse,'' the hardened oil that develops after
crude has spent days in the chilly Alaskan waters, buffeted by
winds and currents.
   ``We shouldn't blame the Russians,'' said Bill Rainey, Exxon
operations manager. ``It was just not the type of oil she was good
in.''
   On Monday, Exxon said it has spent more than $95 million to
clean up the spill and could have contained much of the crude if
authorities hadn't blocked early use of chemical dispersants. But a
top state official accused Exxon of spreading a ``fabrication'' and
said the oil giant had not sought to employ dispersants.
   Also Monday, Gov. Steve Cowper signed a bill raising taxes on
the nation's two largest oil fields, both on Alaska's North Slope.
He said the spill helped make the increase possible.
   Exxon executives disclosed their cleanup costs at the end of a
stormy two-day congressional subcommittee hearing in Valdez. The
$95 million figure doesn't include the cost of government
operations or fishermen's losses.
   The executives told the five-member subcommittee of the House
Interior Committee that they could have contained perhaps half of
the spill had they been allowed to use powerful chemical
dispersants soon after the accident.
   They said the Coast Guard and the state Department of
Environmental Conservation rejected their requests to use the
chemicals widely.
   ``We came to Alaska to use dispersants,'' Exxon Shipping Co.
President Frank Iarossi said. ``I was pleading on my part to begin
dispersal use. ... We were very aggressive.''
   ``We're confident that had we obtained prompt permission to use
the dispersant, the environmental damage would have been
mitigated,'' Exxon USA President Bill Stevens said.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the Department of Environmental
Conservation, called Exxon's account a ``fabrication.'' He said the
state had pre-approved the use of dispersants in parts of Prince
William Sound before the March 24 spill.
   ``Dispersants were not used extensively in the three days
following the tanker accident because the winds and seas were too
calm to provide the turbulence necessary to mix them with oil,''
Kelso said in a statement.
   The day before, Kelso told the subcommittee that Exxon and
Alyeska, which operates the trans-Alaska pipeline, spread
``disinformation'' by contending they sought to use dispersants.
Kelso testified that Exxon did not request permission to use the
chemicals.
   Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the Coast Guard's No. 2 man in the
spill zone, said Exxon and Alyeska did not urge the use of
dispersants. Small-scale tests of the chemicals proved inconclusive.
   ``Neither of them had the equipment on site to deal with it,
either through mechanical means or chemical means,'' he added.
   He also said a contingency plan at Alyeska was inadequate to
deal with a major spill, but Stevens said the state earlier had
endorsed the plan.
   The former captain of the vessel, Joseph Hazelwood, 42, is
accused of operating the ship while intoxicated and faces trial
June 20 in Valdez.
   Cowper signed the new tax bill after the Senate approved it by
11-9. The bill will bring in $235 million in revenue next year and
more than $2 billion during the next two decades based on current
oil prices.
   Oil industry officials had argued that changing the tax formula
ultimately will cost the state jobs and oil revenue.
   ``There's no doubt about the fact that the spill made the
political atmosphere different from what it was before,'' Cowper
said. ``It became a matter of competing credibility: the
credibility of the state versus the credibility of the industry.''
   The cleanup continued in Prince William Sound, where the Exxon
Valdez ran aground and spilled more than 10 million gallons of
crude.

   General Motors Corp. said today it planned to
shut down some of its assembly plants for a month or longer during
the summer to help reduce inventories and provide time for plant
retooling.
   There has been speculation that GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chyrsler
Corp. would have longer-than-normal changeover times because of
slow sales and ambitious production during the first three months
of the year.
   That combination boosted inventories and prompted automakers to
expand incentive programs as the second quarter of the year got
under way.
   Automakers typically shut down production in the late summer to
accommodate vacation periods and retool assembly lines for the
coming model year.
   The shutdown time varies, depending on the extent of the
changeover, but is usually at least two weeks.
   GM spokeswoman Marcia McGee said today the company's carmaking
plant in Flint would be closed between July 13 and Aug. 7, and
plants in Wentzville, Mo., and Orion Township in Oakland County
would be closed for about a month each during June and July.
   She called the shutdown time normal.
   ``We do a lot of retooling, line rearrangement,'' she said.
``Even though there is not a significant new product, there are a
lot of (manufacturing) changes for future product that is not
apparent.''
   She said production at the company's plant in Ypsilanti would be
shut down from May 19 until early next year for changes linked to a
new full-size, rear-wheel-drive model.
   Ward's Automotive Reports said GM planned to stop production at
assembly plants in Doraville, Ga.; Fairfax, Kan.; and Wilmington,
Del., and Hamtramck, Mich.; from a month to six weeks during the
summer.
   GM corporate spokesmen had no comment on general shutdown plans.
Calls to GM's major carmaking groups were referred to each of GM's
five carmaking divisions.
   There are no plans for extended shutdowns at Ford assembly
plants this summer, spokesman Joel Pitcoff said.
   However, he said there are discussions going on about whether to
tack one week on to the normal two-week summer vactation-retooling
period at plants in Chicago; Atlanta; St. Thomas, Ontario; and
Wixom, Mich., as the company installs driver-side air bags in
models that lacked them previously.
   Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said plant closing schedules for
model changeover time have not been announced. Traditionally, he
said, the company staggers the closings in June, July and August.
   ``I'm not aware of any longer-than-normal times for
changeovers,'' he said.

   Investigators told a special Senate committee
today that a Wichita, Kan., company has been stealing oil from
Indian lands for at least the last three years.
   Documents subpoenaed from Koch Industries show that the company
consistently ended the year with hundreds of thousands more barrels
of oil than it pays for, investigators told a special panel of the
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
   A woman at Koch's public relations office in Wichita said nobody
was available immediately to comment on the testimony.
   Although measurement difficulties make it normal for oil
companies to pay for less oil than they actually take _ even up to
12,000 barrels a year _ Koch documents showed the firm ended 1986
with 803,874 excess barrels, 1987 with 671,144 excess barrels and
1988 with 474,281 more barrels than it paid for, witnesses said.
   Chris Tucker, an independent oil and gas expert, said normal
procedure is for oil companies to compensate for ``overages'' by
shorting themselves in future purchases.
   The volumes for the three years shown in the Koch documents were
worth about $12.1 million, $11.9 million and $7.1 million,
respectively.
   Many of the Koch oil purchases were made on Indian lands with
royalties from the oil due to Indian tribes or individual Indians.
   Chuck Norman, an accountant for the special committee, said it
is easy to steal from the Indians because nobody watches the
purchasers, like Koch, take oil from the tanks at the well.
   Furthermore, witnesses said, substantial confusion exists among
federal agencies about who is supposed to police the taking of oil
from Indian lands.
   Tucker said Koch used various means to mismeasure oil. He showed
a videotape he secretly made of a Koch employee taking oil at a
Northern Ute Indian oil field in Utah. He said it showed that the
employee did not follow all the procedures necessary to accurately
measure the oil.
   Under questioning, Norman said evidence was being gathered on
other companies as well and would be turned over to authorities.
   ``We are not a grand jury,'' said Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., the panel's chairman. ``We are attempting to zero in on
the problem and how it happens.''
   In an interview before the hearings began, DeConcini and Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., said the committee's findings will be turned
over to the Justice Department which could seek indictments.
   ``This thing is a mammoth problem,'' said DeConcini. ``If we'd
had another year we may have found more.''
   He said investigators hid behind bushes in the oil fields and
saw companies ``mismeasure'' the amount of oil they took from wells.
   Many of the areas are so remote that no one supervises the
action, he said.
   The senators said none of the top seven oil corporations is
involved, though the ones that are involved are multimillion-dollar
operations. They are mostly independent, ``middle-level''
companies, they said.
   Earl Ross, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said
none of the companies is a member of his organization, which is the
largest oil trade association in the country.
   But he said the institute supplied the committee with technical
information on how to measure oil.
   The hearings on oil companies this week and the Indian Health
Service next week are the second segment of a series being
conducted by the special panel.
   In February, the panel investigated contracting fraud, organized
crime and child abuse on Indian reservations and among those doing
business with them.
   The hearings on the health service are expected to reveal
``gross mismanagement,'' said the senators.
   ``It's a tragedy of all tragedies,'' said DeConcini, saying the
health service provided care at ``less than the norm for the
nation.''
   McCain said the goal of the committee is to determine how well
the federal government is fulfilling its responsibility to the
Indians.
   ``Our job is to review policies, programs and management so we
can recommend changes so problems won't happen again,'' he said.
   DeConcini said he expected to have a report on all the
committee's findings by October.

<HEAD>Retailer Teams With CBS for Promotion of Network's New Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a bid to generate excitement for CBS' fall
television programs and gain publicity for K mart Corp., the TV
network and the retailer plan a big national promotion tied to the
September premiere of CBS shows.
   The promotion will be built around a viewer involvement game and
will be plugged on the CBS TV network, on CBS radio and in national
magazines, newspapers and in special K mart Sunday newspaper
circulars.
   Game cards and instructions will be distributed nationwide in K
mart Sunday circulars for three weeks. K mart and CBS will alert
viewers in print and via electronic media how to play and which
shows to watch.
   More than 6 million prizes will be offered, including 12 grand
prizes that include mini-vans and family vacations to Hollywood.
Most of the prizes can be redeemed at the 2,200 K mart stores
nationwide.
   The promotion, described in a news release as the largest ever
in TV history and one of the biggest general mass merchandise
pitches in retail history, has a two-fold purpose.
   For CBS, it apparently is intended to encourage viewers to
switch on the network's new schedule and hopefully get hooked while
playing the game.
   ``We'll involve huge numbers of viewers in an exciting way to
generate tremendous awareness and attention for our new programs
and our new schedule,'' said George F. Schweitzer, a CBS senior
vice president who oversees the network's advertising, promotion
and publicity. ``Nothing on this scale has been attempted before.''
   Jerry K. Habeck, K mart's director of advertising, said the
retailer is hoping to win new customers through the promotional
link with CBS.
   ``When our agency ... suggested we use our stores as media
outlets to develop a major promotion ... with a network, we saw it
as an opportunity to further enhance our image and gain recognition
as the place where America shops for everyday low prices on quality
items,'' Habeck said.
   K mart, the second largest retailer in the country, has been
facing stiffer competition since industry leader Sears, Roebuck and
Co. introduced a new low-pricing policy earlier this year.
   The Troy, Mich.-based retailer, which has conducted promotions
with celebrities including actress Jaclyn Smith and golfer Fuzzy
Zoeller, will display advertisements for CBS' programs in its
stores.
   Special CBS videos about its new programs will be aired in K
marts and all TV monitors in K marts' electronics departments will
be tuned to local CBS affiliates. Celebrity appearances and other
in-store activities are planned.
   K mart apparently isn't concerned about possible negative
consequences if new CBS shows lag in ratings.
   A K mart official who asked not to be identified by name said no
one can predict how the new shows will fare and the retailer is
just intending to capitalize on the excitement at the beginning of
the season.
   Schweitzer of CBS said K mart has not been granted an option to
preview the fall lineup and the network doesn't anticipate that its
shows will be objectionable to anyone. ``This network doesn't have
those kind of problems to any large degree,'' he said.
   Numerous advertisers recently have yanked their commercial
support from programs after special interest groups complained
about the contents.
   The amount of money CBS and K mart will spend on the promotion
was not disclosed.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Slip On Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices fell moderately Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade on perceptions that growing conditions
are gradually improving.
   ``I think you saw some profit-taking and I think some people
looked at the weather forecast,'' said Katharina Zimmer,
grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New
York.
   Soybean futures ended mostly higher on persistent rumors of
Soviet buying interest, while corn futures ended narrowly mixed.
   Monday's six-to-10-day forecast from the National Weather
Service predicted normal rainfall and normal temperatures early
next week in most major U.S. crop areas.
   Rain would bring little relief to winter-wheat farmers in
Kansas, because it's too late to revive the sizable portion of that
crop damaged by lack of moisture and extreme temperatures.
   But showers would improve the prospects for getting the spring
wheat crop off to a good start in the northern Plains, analysts
said.
   The contract for May delivery of wheat plunged 10 cents a
bushel, but analysts attributed the drop to factors surrounding the
contract's upcoming expiration rather than supply-and-demand
fundamentals.
   At the close, wheat settled 3{ cents to 10 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.26 a bushel; corn was 2 cents

   The stock market declined in afternoon trading
today, pressured by jitters in the bond market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 14.12 points to
2,362.35 at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was down 1.84
points an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 4 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 879 issues down, 508 up and 541
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 127.06 million shares.
   Analysts said a slump in the bond market helped drive stock
prices lower. The Treasury began its three-day borrowing today amid
concern that foreign investors, particularly Japanese investors,
might be reluctant to enter bids.
   Some observers said the concern stemmed partly from prospects
that a rapidly rising dollar faced aggressive selling by central
banks and that the Japanese might raise interest rates.
   Analysts said the market also remained cautious in anticipation
of Friday's government report on producer prices, which will
provide additional information about the economy's growth.
   Analysts said last week's unemployment report provided mixed
signals and confused the market.
   Unemployment rose 0.3 percentage point to 5.3 percent in April,
indicating a slowdown in economic growth. But the market focused on
the part of the report showing hourly earnings rose seven cents,
suggesting inflation might still be a problem.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
0.91 lower at 170.35.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
1.27 to 344.58.

   The stock market declined in relatively low
volume today, pressured by jitters in the bond market and ongoing
inflation worries.
   The market opened on an up-note, then drifted lower as economic
uncertainty set in.
   Early in the day, many buyers withdrew from the market to await
the start of the Treasury's three-day auction of notes and bonds.
Investors also were reluctant to make commitments ahead of Friday's
wholesale price data, market observers said.
   The bond market took a nosedive late in the day after the first
round of the government auction. Stocks followed, with program
selling dominating the action.
   Analysts said that the bond market had anticipated a more
enthusiastic response from foreign investors to the Treasury's
$9.75 billion sale of three-year notes.
   ``Apparently the auction didn't go so well,'' said Michael Metz,
vice president of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Before the sale observers had predicted that stock prices would
follow the bond market's reaction.
   Analysts said the stock market also remained cautious in
anticipation of Friday's government report on producer prices,
which will provide additional information about the economy's
growth.
   The producer price index has particular significance for the
market after last week's unemployment report, which provided mixed
signals, traders said.
   The report showed unemployment rose 0.3 percentage point to 5.3
percent in April, indicating a slowdown in economic growth. But the
market focused on the part of the report showing hourly earnings
rose seven cents, suggesting inflation might still be a problem.
   ``So the concern is shifting to stagflation,'' said Alfred E.
Goldman, vice president of the investment firm A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons
Inc. Stagflation refers to a condition of stagnant economic growth
coupled with inflation.

   Oil future prices recovered some recent losses
Tuesday, although analysts said internal market influences were
largely responsible for the rebound.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
32 cents higher at $19.76 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract had
declined 58 cents Monday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery rose 0.54 cent to
65.52 cents a gallon, after losing 2.52 cents Monday.
   June heating oil, which declined 2.12 cents the previous
session, settled at 46.99 cents a gallon, up 0.30 cent.
   William Byers, an energy analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.,
attributed Tuesday's price increase primarily to internal forces of
supply and demand in the market, in the absence of any fundamental
changes.
   ``There was a feeling that the market was oversold,'' Byers said.
   He said the market remained concerned about an oil glut among
OPEC producers.
   Monday's selloff was triggered by a report that showed members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had boosted
their daily production last month to 20.9 million barrels.
   OPEC's self-imposed quota is 18.5 million barrels a day.

<HEAD>More Charges Brought Against Bank Linked to Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors have brought more
money-laundering charges against a Luxembourg banking group, adding
two employees as defendants and implicating the bank's Colombian
branch office.
   The charges were contained in a new indictment against the Bank
of Credit and Commerce International Holdings S.A., which U.S.
Senate testimony has linked to money laundering by Panama's
military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga.
   The new indictment was returned by a grand jury in Tampa last
week and made public Monday.
   In what was called a landmark case against an international
financial institution, the bank was charged in October with
laundering $14 million in cocaine profits collected in seven U.S.
cities.
   Some of the new charges apparently were based on testimony from
convicted smuggler-turned-informant Steven Michael Kalish. Kalish
won a sentence reduction from 14 to 10 years last week because of
his cooperation with federal authorities.
   The new indictment also combines the bank case and a related
money-laundering indictment against Gonzalo Mora Jr., a Colombian
businessman.
   Larry Barcella, one of the bank's Washington attorneys, said the
government was merely trying to shore up its case. The revised
charges are ``a simple transparent attempt'' by prosecutors to
resolve challenges the bank has raised in court filings seeking to
dismiss the indictment, he said.
   Mora's attorney, George Tragos, said his client was being
penalized by having his case merged with the bank's case.
   ``Mr. Mora can't possibly defend himself in a case that is so
large,'' said Tragos. ``He doesn't have the resources to match an
international bank or the government.''
   The bank indictment was one of three formal charges returned
here after a two-year U.S. Customs Service sting in which agents
laundered $32 million in drug proceeds for Colombian cocaine
cartels. The sting led to the indictment of 82 people in six cities.
   The new indictment includes allegations that Kalish laundered
millions of his smuggling ring's profits through the bank's
Panamanian and Colombian branches.
   Kalish linked the bank and Noriega, to his Tampa-based smuggling
ring during U.S. Senate testimony in January 1988.
   Prosecutors have said that his testimony was the key to
Noriega's indictment in February 1988 on drug charges here and in
Miami.
   Kalish was sentenced in February 1988 as the marshal of a ring
that smuggled 500,000 pounds of marijuana and 2,000 pounds of
cocaine from Colombia.

<TEXT>
   The head of OPEC said Tuesday the cartel
will strive toward price stability and review its petroleum
production at a summer meeting.
   Subroto, secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, made the remarks upon arriving on a flight
from Frankfurt to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   Subroto, accompanied by his personal secretary, said he would
meet Wednesday morning with Texas Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance
at a breakfast session. Hance's commission regulates the Texas oil
industry and he has been an active observer of OPEC meetinggs in
the past.
   ``The message is that the member countries are striving toward
price stability'' at about $18 per barrel, Subroto said.
   It was Subroto's first American appearance since taking the OPEC
job last July. He was scheduled to address a Thursday luncheon
sponsored by Southern Methodist University's Institute for the
Study of Earth and Man in his only planned U.S. talk this year.
   Subroto's presentation, ``Long-term Prospects for Oil
Stability,'' at the Fairmont Hotel in Dallas was expected to
attract an estimated 1,000 oil and gas industry representatives and
others from the Southwest.
   Formerly Indonesia's minister of mines and energy, Subroto was
credited with developing a production agreement signed by OPEC
members. The pact has prompted an increase in oil prices since last
November.
   Subroto said he believed the performance of OPEC member
countries based on that agreement was ``pretty satisfactory.''
   Based in Vienna, Austria, OPEC's 13 member countries have been
instrumental in setting and maintaining worldwide oil prices.
   The organization has been watched closely by other petroleum
producing countries in anticipation of OPEC's June 5 meeting in
Vienna. Oil analysts have expressed concern following a 50 percent
price increase in past months and production levels that appear to
be rising.
   Strong demand has caused oil price rallies, with the latest
coming last week after reports of a delay in repairing the North
Sea's Cormorant Alpha platform, hit by an April 18 explosion.

<HEAD>Dollar Weaker in U.S. Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar retreated slightly in choppy U.S.
trading Tuesday as dealers turned cautious about buying the
American currency.
   Gold prices rose in the United States, after weakening in
dealings abroad. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a troy
ounce of gold bullion at $378 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $2.60 higher than
the late bid Monday.
   Ross Taylor, a senior vice president at Kemper Currency Inc.,
said U.S. market participants became leery of having their currency
portfolios heavily weighted in favor of the dollar despite comments
from West German and Swiss authorities indicating that they were
not worried by current dollar levels.
   Some participants may be unwilling to add to their dollar
positions ahead of inflation statistics due later this week, he
said. The Labor Department is to issue the April producer price
index on Friday.
   Also discouraging buyers was a feeling in the U.S. market that
the dollar had gone up far enough after hitting a nine-month high
against the West German mark Monday.
   Earlier, the dollar advanced on European markets to its highest
level against the mark since last August, lifted by perceptions
that the U.S. economy continues to grow strongly enough to keep
interest rates aloft.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Europe said there had been no sign
of concerted intervention by central banks to sell dollars in order
to hold down the exchange rate, although the Bank of Japan and Bank
of England apparently did so on their own. U.S. dealers didn't
detect any interventions during U.S. trading.
   Central bank dollar sales in the past few weeks has not diluted
the currency's value and has been considered a largely symbolic
attempt to remind the markets that authorities are monitoring
exchange rates.
   In Europe, the dollar reached 1.9158 West German marks, up from
1.8975 on Monday and its highest level since Aug. 22 last year,
when it stood at 1.9190. Dealers said they expect the dollar to
test the 1.92 marks level this week.
   In U.S. trading, the dollar ended at 1.9094 marks, down slightly
from 1.9097 on Monday, the highest point since August 1988.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6605 late Tuesday, cheaper
for buyers than Monday's late $1.6710. Sterling stood at $1.6665
compared to $1.6646 on Monday.
   The dollar closed at 135.00 Japanese yen in Tokyo, up from
134.52 late Monday. In later London trading, the dollar traded
lower at 134.80 and in New York it ended at 134.525, down from
Monday's closing rate of 134.89.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late
Monday, included: 1.6955 Swiss francs, down from 1.7025; 6.4455
French francs, up from 6.4405; 1,391.50 Italian lire, down from
1,392.75; and, 1.18695 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1846.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday: 1.7035 Swiss francs, up from 1.6945; 6.4645 French francs,
up from 6.4025; 2.1610 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1400; 1,397.125
Italian lire, up from 1,385.00; 1.1869 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1850.
   Gold and silver prices had mixed showings on world precious
metals markets.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
settled at $378.80 a troy ounce, up from $376.90 Monday.
   The late bid gold price in London, the major market, was $376.50
a troy ounce, down from $377.50. In Zurich, the late bid price was
$376.40, down from $377.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $376.15, down from $377.25.
   Silver bullion for current delivery closed on New York's Comex
at $5.667 a troy ounce, up from Monday's settlement of $5.588.
Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.63 a troy ounce, down
from $5.64.

<HEAD>IBM Announces Two PCs, Rebates On Base-Layer Software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday
announced two new personal computers, one that is slightly cheaper
than before and another that is slightly lighter.
   Neither machine broke new ground, but IBM, the world leader in
personal computer market share, is hoping the models will attract
more customers to its 2-year-old Personal System-2 line.
   In another step, IBM is expected to tie its PCs more closely to
its bigger computers next week by announcing programs that have the
same look and feel across the product spectrum.
   One of the machines announced Tuesday, the Model 55 SX, uses a
simplified version of Intel Corp.'s 80386 chip, which several other
personal computer makers including Compaq Computer Corp. have
already adopted.
   IBM said the model would be its cheapest 80386-based personal
computer yet, with versions listed at $3,895 and $4,295.
   The other new machine, the P70 386, is the first portable model
at the high end of IBM's line. It is bigger and heavier than a
laptop and cannot run on batteries. It weighs 20 pounds and
measures 12 inches by 18 inches by 5 inches. Versions are listed at
$7,695 and $8,295.
   IBM also announced rebates ranging up to $800 on the base-layer
software, Operating System-2, which runs on many PS-2 computers and
other makes of high-powered personal computers.
   The rebates are to offset the expense of buying the extra
internal memory that the complex base-layer software requires.
   IBM plans to announce next Tuesday a collection of programs
under the Officevision Family label that should make computing
simpler by standardizing the appearance and format of the software,
the New York Times reported Tuesday.
   IBM executives declined to comment on the report, but the idea
fits in with the company's stated strategy.
   For example, IBM is working to make it possible for someone at a
networked personal computer to issue commands at the keyboard
without knowing what computer is doing the work or where the
information is coming from, executives said.
   By reducing complexity from the user's point of view, ``It
levels the playing field, so to speak,'' Robert Carberry, vice
president of systems in IBM's Entry Systems Division, said in an
interview.

   Stock prices fell in sluggish trading Tuesday,
as the market awaited new economic data later in the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 5.14 points to
2,371.33, its eighth consecutive decline.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
824 issues down, 623 up and 525 unchanged.
   The market opened higher, but failed to sustain the early gains
with uncertainty dominating the picture. Except for a brief spurt
in the afternoon led by program selling, volume remained light.
Analysts said the quietness reflected a lack of buying rather than
selling activity.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 150.09 million
shares, up from 135.13 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 180.3 million shares.
   Analysts said the market remained cautious in anticipation of
Friday's government report on producer prices, which will provide
another gauge of inflation.
   Last Friday's jobless report triggered the latest uncertainty.
The report showed unemployment rose 0.3 percentage point in April
to 5.3 percent, indicating a slowdown in economic growth. But the
market focused on the part of the report showing hourly earnings
rose seven cents, suggesting inflation might still be a problem.
   ``The PPI Friday takes on extra significance because while
employment figures showed a slowdown, they also showed a pickup in
wage rates,'' said said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of the
investment firm A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
   ``The concern is shifting to stagflation and the PPI will either
add fuel to that concern or ease it,'' he said.
   A late drop in the bond market gave stocks a last-minute shove
following the first round of the Treasury's three-day refunding.
   Analysts said that the bond market had anticipated a more
enthusiastic response from foreign investors to the Treasury's
$9.75 billion sale of three-year notes.
   ``Apparently the auction didn't go so well,'' said Michael Metz,
vice president of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Before the sale, observers had predicted that stock prices would
follow the bond market's reaction.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market dropped $7.644 billion, or 0.25
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.46 to 170.80.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Pan Am rose | point to
5 while NWA Inc. lost { to 104\ after Pan Am announced that it is

S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 0.81 to 305.19.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell

<HEAD>Modifications Might Not Be Enough, Congressional Staffers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline industry officials hope plans to
extensively repair and modify 1,300 older Boeing jets will help
answer demands to ensure the safety of older passenger aircraft,
but some congressional staff members say it won't be enough.
   In the 13 months since the top ripped off an Aloha Airlines 737
over Hawaii, killing a flight attendant, Boeing Co., airlines and
the Federal Aviation Administration have hustled to reassure the
public that older commercial jetliners are safe.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to issue
its report on the accident this month.
   Also expected soon are proposed FAA rules ordering 161
structural repairs and modifications for 1,300 older Boeing 727s,
737s and 747s. The estimated $600,000 worth of repairs per plane
will include replacing skin, rivets and other parts that get worn
as a plane ages.
   After the orders dealing with Boeing planes are issued,
aging-jet task forces will deal with planes made by McDonnell
Douglas Corp., Lockheed Corp., Europe's Airbus Industrie, Convair,
Fokker and British Aircraft Corp.
   According to aviation consultant Avmark Inc., 832, or almost 29
percent, of the nation's commercial jetliners were at least 20
years old as of last July. More than 15 percent, or 422, of the
jets were between 15 and 19 years old.
   Bill Becker, a Seattle aviation consultant, said the rules
should subdue what he calls the ``congressional dragon.''
   ``He'll continue to snort and vibrate, but he will be
appeased,'' Becker said.
   Maybe not. James Berard, a spokesman for Minnesota Democratic
Rep. James Oberstar, who heads the House subcomittee on aviation,
said the modifications don't go far enough.
   ``(These fixes) are still far short of what Congressman Oberstar
had in mind,'' Berard said. ``There will be further investigation
into the question to determine if additional legislation is
needed.''
   FAA spokesman David Duff in Seattle declined to discuss the
rules until they are formally released. But the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer on Monday cited industry sources as saying they
are expected to involve the following:
   _Seventy-four repairs to about 800 Boeing 727s with 60,000 or
more takeoff and landing cycles or 60,000 hours of flight.
   _Fifty-six repairs to about 300 Boeing 737s with 75,000 or more
cycles or 60,000 flight hours.
   _Thirty-one repairs to about 200 Boeing 747s with at least
20,000 flight cycles or 60,000 hours in flight.
   The proposals are expected to be filed in the Federal Register
next week and interested parties will have time to comment before
they become law.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Up Strongly For Second Day On Supply Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices climbed aggressively for the second
straight day Tuesday, reflecting worries about the tight
availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans.
   On other markets, pork futures were up strongly while cattle
prices were mixed; energy futures rose; precious metals were
higher; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Coffee settled .81 cent lower to 2.75 cents higher on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery in
May up 2.75 cents at $1.4125 a pound.
   The sharp runup in the May delivery price followed an exchange
report showing the amount of warehoused coffee available for
delivery against the May contract at a 5-year low of less than
160,000 bags. Each bag contains 132 pounds of green, unroasted
coffee beans.
   With so little coffee available for delivery against the May
contract, which expires on May 19, fear of a so-called ``squeeze''
is building in the market, in which the physical availability of a
commodity is less than the amount required to satisfy all contracts.
   ``There just isn't enough product around,'' said Bert Ruiz, a
vice president with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York. One reason
for the supply tightness, he said, was an 18-day dockworkers strike
earlier this month in the Brazilian port of Santos, the world's
busiest coffee port.
   Frozen pork-belly futures soared the permitted 2-cents-a-pound
limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Analysts said the rally
was supported by strong cash markets but was mainly due to
technical factors.
   Hog futures also rallied but cattle futures were mixed with
strong cash markets offset by expectations of seasonal price
weakness in the coming weeks.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .27 cent higher with June
at 72.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .18 cent
higher with May at 76.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent to
.35 cent higher with June at 48.17 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.98 cents to 2 cents higher with May at 34 cents a
pound.
   Petroleum futures prices rebounded from Monday's steep losses on
the New York Mercantile Exchange but the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly stockpile figures, which were released after the
close, were expected to prompt new selling on Wednesday.
   The API reported that U.S. gasoline stocks increased by 808,000
barrels last week while crude oil stocks rose by 9.316 million
barrels. Distillates were down 495,000 barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 32
cents higher with June at $19.76 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent
to .30 cent higher with June at 46.99 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .11 cent lower to .54 cent higher with June at 65.52
cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures rose moderately on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the dollar weakened.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $1.90 higher with June at $380.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 7.8 cents to 9 cents higher with July at $5.755 a
troy ounce.
   Wheat futures prices fell on the Chicago Board of Trade on a
combination of weakening chart signals and perceptions that growing
conditions are gradually improving.
   Soybean futures ended mostly higher on persistent rumors of
Soviet buying interest, while corn futures finished mostly lower.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 10 cents lower with May at $4.26 a
bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $2.77{
a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 4 cents lower with May at $1.88{ a

$7.66\ a bushel.

<HEAD>Shareholders Get Upbeat Report from Management on Post-Bankruptcy
Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. officials faced the company's
stockholders Tuesday for the first time since its post-bankruptcy
restructuring, saying the problems that jolted the oil giant during
this decade are over.
   ``After several years of some very special challenges, a new
Texaco has emerged _ a company with its own vision for greatness, a
company with its sights set firmly on the future,'' Texaco Chairman
Alfred C. DeCrane said at the company's annual stockholders meeting
in Atlanta.
   DeCrane and James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief
executive officer, presented an optimistic portrayal to the
attentive gathering.
   The officials said the White Plains, N.Y.-based company is in
good financial health and ready to reclaim its position as an
industry leader. Noting the recent Exxon Valdez oil spill in
Alaska, Kinnear also stressed that Texaco is committed to
preventing another environmental disaster.
   The shareholders voted the company line on proxy matters,
overwhelmingly approving two special dividends worth about $2
billion, a proposal to strengthen the company's defense against
unsolicited takeover offers, an employee compensation plan tied to
performance, the hiring of a new auditor and the election of five
directors.
   The stockholders rejected two separate proposals urging the
company to curtail its operations in South Africa and an item aimed
at making proxy ballots secret.
   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, asked a federal
bankruptcy court in 1987 to protect it from creditors. The move
followed a $10.3 billion judgment won against Texaco by Pennzoil
Co., which charged Texaco with blocking Pennzoil's plans to acquire
Getty Oil Co.
   The company also faced an attempt last year by New York investor
Carl Ichan to take over Texaco.
   Texaco emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year
and launched a restructuring program that included the projected
sale of more than $5 billion in operating assets. In February, the
company completed the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. to Imperial Oil
Ltd. for $3.24 billion.
   Texaco also reached a ``standstill agreement'' with Ichan, who
owns 42.2 million shares or 17.6 percent of the company's common
stock, under which he would cast his votes in accordance with the
expressed will of other shareholders.
   Texaco's first quarter 1989 net income was $1.4 million.
   ``There are clear signs that we're on the right path,'' DeCrane
said.
   ``True, we are trimmer,'' he said. ``But we still provide fully
5 percent of the free world's energy needs.''
   Kinnear said Texaco is becoming more selective in its
investments, including upgrading its refining capabilities,
exploration efforts and laboratories. The company also plans to
repurchase $500 million worth of Texaco stock by August 1990, he
said.
   Kinnear also discussed the Valdez spill, calling it
``regrettable.''
   He defended Texaco's environmental record, saying its policy is
to ``ensure the most stringent training and prevention to ensure
the safe operation not only of our tanker fleet and fleets, but of
all our operations from rigs to pipelines to refineries and to
distribution and marketing.''

<TEXT>
   One of the nation's largest mail-order
companies, Spiegel Inc., has agreed to begin collecting the Texas
sales tax on items shipped into the state, Comptroller Bob Bullock
announced Tuesday.
   The development is important because many mail-order retailers
have been fighting legislative proposals that would make them
collect sales taxes, which would raise the prices they charge to
consumers and eliminate one of the lures of mail-order buying.
   Bullock, who argues that mail order sales deprive the state of
tax revenue it would collect on identical sales in the state, has
been urging federal approval of legislation to require mail order
firms to collect sales taxes from states where they do business.
   Bullock said that Spiegel, headquartered in Oak Brook, Ill.,
volunteered to collect the state's 6 percent tax.
   ``Spiegel Inc. executives told us that we could expect several
million dollars a year in state sales taxes. That's a lot of
revenue, and it's from just one of many mail order companies that
send their goods to Texas,'' Bullock said.
   Officials in the comptroller's tax information division said
Spiegel is the first out-of-state company to volunteer to collect
the Texas tax.
   Mail order firms which are based in Texas must collect the tax
on items sold to Texans, officials said.
   Spiegel will begin collecting and reporting the tax beginning
July 1, Bullock said, adding that he hopes other companies will
follow suit.
   He said 1987 estimates showed that Texans spent nearly $5.2
billion on mail order merchandise that would be taxed if sold
inside the state's borders.
   ```I hope that other out-of-state mail order firms will follow
Spiegel's good, public-spirited example. Not having to collect our
sales tax gives them an unfair advantage over our local
businesses,'' he said.
   If the federal law is changed to require such collections by
out-of-state companies, Bullock said, Texas could expect to take in
about $130 million more in sales tax revenue annually.

   Apple Computer Inc. is improving its system
software to hang on to the appeal of its Macintosh, the company
reported on Tuesday.
   The expanded software will extend memory capabilities to allow
programs to work together more efficiently, starring a feature
called ``virtual memory.''
   Virtual memory will extend the user's available memory by
treating the hard disk as if it were part of internal memory.
   Apple is planning to offer the new System 7.0 to software
developers by the end of the year, the company said.
   Other features include a new print architecture connected to
different printers and other devices made by companies other than
Apple _ an apparent move away from Apple's past efforts to maintain
the proprietary nature of its technology.
   ``That must have been a tough decision,'' said Nick Arnett, an
analyst with Creative Strategies Research International, a Silicon
Valley market research company. ``It may hurt their priinter
business, but it will strengthen the Macintosh by giving it many
more options.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Steve Cowper signed into law a bill
raising oil taxes by $235 million after the oil-industry-dominated
state Senate reversed itself in the wake of constituents' anger
over the Exxon Valdez spill.
   Cowper, saying big oil does not run Alaska, signed the bill
three hours after Monday's 11-9 vote, thwarting a last-ditch move
in the Senate to rescind the vote.
   ``There's no doubt about the fact that the spill made the
political atmosphere different from what it was before,'' the
governor said. ``It became a matter of competing credibility: the
credibility of the state vs. the credibility of the industry.''
   Oil industry officials argued that changing the tax formula
ultimately will cost the state jobs and oil revenue.
   The bill, which eliminates a tax break for the nation's two
largest oil fields, will add $235 million to the state treasury
next year and more than $2 billion over the next two decades, based
on current oil prices. Already, about 85 percent of the state's
$2.2 billion budget comes from oil and gas revenues.
   On Sunday, the state Senate, which had never before let the bill
even reach the floor, rejected the bill in a 9-11 vote.
   But Democratic Sen. Mike Szymanski, whose district includes
oil-stained Prince William Sound, and Republican Johne Binkley
reversed their initial ``no'' votes, providing the needed support
Monday for passage.
   The March 24 oil spill polluted the sound with more than 10
million gallons of North Slope crude. Binkley and Szymanski said
they did not change their vote to punish the industry, but both
said calls from constituents had influenced them.
   ``I think the oil companies, by and large, have been good
corporate citizens in the state of Alaska,'' Binkley said.
   But he said he received dozens of phone calls in the hours
following the first vote, most urging him to change his mind. A
brief private talk with Cowper, who had lobbied heavily for the
tax, also helped change his vote, he said.
   Szymanski, who said Sunday night that he could not approve a tax
increase, said Monday that he concluded the increase was needed to
ensure that Alaska gets its fair share of oil revenue.
   ``I would certainly hope that some of the additional money that
is made available by the (tax) would be made available to support
the local communities that were directly impacted by the oil
spill,'' he said.
   Szymanski said his phone rang constantly Monday. ``I had a lot
of pressure on me from the constituency,'' he said.
   The new law revises an oil-tax break known as the Economic Limit
Factor, or ELF. Cowper and other proponents of the bill said the
tax break should not apply to the productive Prudhoe Bay and
Kuparuk oil fields on Alaska's North Slope.
   It took three years for an ELF bill to make it to a vote on the
floor of the Republican-led Senate, long a stronghold of oil
industry support. The Democrat-controlled House approved an ELF
bill twice, in 1987 and this year.
   Exxon, which has a relatively small share of those two oil
fields, will pay only about 15 percent of the tax increase. At 15
percent, the company's share for the first year of the tax increase
would amount to about $45 million.
   BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., a subsidiary of British Petroleum,
will pay about half of the additional taxes.
   ``We're disappointed,'' company spokesman Paul A. Laird said.
``We think it's not in the best interests of the state in the long
term economicially.''
   State officials said $150 million of the first year's revenue
from the tax hike will go into the state's oil-wealth savings
account, which was created to ensure that the state benefits from
the oil after it is gone.
   Nearly half of each year's earnings from the account are
distributed to residents. Last year, each qualified resident got
$826 from the fund.

<TEXT>
   Investigators implicated a Kansas-based oil
company Tuesday in testimony before a Senate panel that is checking
allegations of millions of dollars in oil and royalties being
stolen from Indians.
   The investigators told a special unit of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs that Koch Industries, which does a
large amount of business on Indian oilfields, over the past three
years consistently took hundreds of thousands more barrels of crude
oil than it paid for.
   But Donald L. Cordes, Koch Industries vice president for legal
and corporate affairs, said the Senate panel didn't reveal that the
so-called overages were a very small percentage of the total oil
the company buys and resells. He said the committee also has
information that Koch crude oil purchases were measured short the
first two months of 1989.
   For 1988, the Koch Industries overage was .0023 of the total
volume of crude oil handled and measured by the company, he said.
   ``This percentage is well within the range of overage
percentages reflected in the reports of the states which compile
that data,'' Cordes said.
   There isn't any basis for concluding Koch engages in illicit
measuring practices, he said.
   A spokesman for the Senate panel said that depositions were
taken with officials of Koch, though the officials were not called
to testify Tuesday.
   A certain amount of mismeasuring is normal in the industry, but
not to the degree shown in documents subpoenaed from Koch, said
witnesses.
   The documents indicated that Koch ended 1986 with 803,874 more
barrels of oil than it paid for; 1987 with 671,144 more barrels and
1988 with 474,281 more barrels. The value of the extra oil for the
three years was estimated at $12.2 million, $11.9 million and $7.1
million.
   ``Most companies try to be as accurate as possible,'' testified
Chris Tucker, an independent oil expert who investigated Koch. ``If
there are large overages, the company should figure out why this is
happening.''
   Tucker had been hired to investigate the company by a brother of
the owner, Charles Koch, said a Senate panel spokesman who
indicated the two brothers had quarreled.
   Tucker said that companies normally compensate for overages by
shorting themselves later and that the figures from Koch indicate
an intent by the company to take more than it pays for.
   ``It's very easy to steal from Indian lands,'' said Tucker.
``There are no checks and balances.''
   He and other witnesses said the fields are in remote areas and
are not generally watched.
   Tucker showed the committee a videotape he said he secretly made
of a Koch employee taking oil from a tank on Northern Ute Indian
land in Utah. The employee failed to perform all of the measuring
functions required under American Petroleum Institute standards,
Tucker testified.
   Chuck Norman, an investigator for the committee, said other oil
firms also were being probed. He said information about them would
be turned over to authorities.
   Before the hearings began, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said
findings would be given to the Justice Department which could seek
indictments.
   ``We are not a grand jury,'' DeConcini, who chairs the special
committee, said during the hearing. ``We are attempting to zero in
on the problem and how it happens.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the purpose of the investigation
was to determine whether there was mismanagement by the federal
government and, if so, what steps Congress should take.
   Norman said there was confusion among the three federal agencies
that are charged with protecting Indian oil rights _ the Bureau of
Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Minerals
Management Service _ about who should be policing the fields.
   ``Usually nothing is done'' about theft, he said.
   The special committee will be investigating oil and oil royalty
theft on Indian land throughout the week.
   The hearings make up the second series since the panel began its
probe. Testimony in February alleged corruption in contracting and
gaming operations on Indian reservations and child sex abuse in
Bureau of Indian Affairs schools.
   DeConcini said he hopes to have a report by October that will
lead to changes in the government's approach to the Indians.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a surge in first-quarter earnings
and sales Tuesday, attributing the performance to the fast-growing
chain's improvements in costs and inventory management.
   Meanwhile, Limited Inc., a leading apparel retailer, said its
first-quarter earnings soared 89 percent over the lackluster
results of a year earlier.
   Wal-Mart, the nation's No. 3 retailer behind Sears, Roebuck and
Co. and K mart Corp. said earnings for the three months ended April
30 totaled $198.29 million or 35 cents a share, a 29 percent jump
over the $153.5 million or 27 cents a share reported in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Sales totaled $5.37 billion, a 25 percent jump over the $4.31
billion figure a year earlier.
   As of April 30, the Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart operated
1,279 Wal-Mart stores, 106 Sam's Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot Discount
Drug stores and three Hypermart USA units. A year earlier, the
company had 1,144 Wal-Mart stores, 86 Sam's Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot
Discount Drug stores and one Hypermart USA unit.
   ``First quarter sales, driven by improved apparel sales and
basic in-stock positions, ran above plan throughout the period,''
David Glass, Wal-Mart president and chief executive officer, said
in a release. ``Improved expense control and better inventory
management converted this positive sales trend to good earnings
results.
   ``Our aggressive sales and earnings plans for the balance of the
year can now be pursued with this sound first quarter as our
foundation,'' he said.
   Limited reported first-quarter net income of $45.2 million, or
25 cents per share, up from $23.9 million, or 13 cents per share, a
year earlier.
   The Columbus, Ohio-based company reported first-quarter sales of
$964.6 million, up from $811.1 million in the first three months of
1988, when it and other apparel retailers were in the midst of a
year-long slump.
   ``We are pleased with our first-quarter increases, achieved in
what I still believe to be a lackluster environment,'' Chairman
Leslie H. Wexner said in a statement.
   Limited operates 3,411 apparel stores, including Limited,
Express, Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret, Lerner, Lane Bryant,
Lerner Woman and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. The company also operates
mail order businesses under the Brylane and Victoria's Secret names.

   Bills were introduced Tuesday that would
require oil companies to be able to handle oil spills within five
hours and which also would impose a penny-a-barrel tax on refined
oil to finance a $500 million oil spill research and cleanup fund.
   A bill by Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., would require
industry-financed emergency response teams, certified by the Coast
Guard and subject to unannounced drills, to be located regionally
and ``custom-designed for the environment they are assigned to
protect.''
   Teams would have to be in place by Jan. 1, 1991. Punishment for
violations would include fines of up to $1 million, and oil
companies' chief executive officers would be directly responsible
for violations.
   Saxton said ``this legislation addresses the basic questions
that everyone has asked all along about the Alaskan oil spill'' in
March when an Exxon tanker struck a reef and more than 10 million
gallons of crude oil leaked into water in Prince William Sound.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, also introduced a legislative
package that would create a $500 million oil spill research and
restoration fund administered by the Environmental Protection
Agency and financed through a penny-a-barrel tax on refined
domestic and imported oil.
   At a news conference that also included Sen. Bennett Johnston,
D-La., Stevens said the Coast Guard authority to assume immediate
control of large or life-threatening oil spills in Prince William
Sound and use industry funds in response to a major spill.
   Another bill in Stevens' package would require tankers crossing
the sound to have equipment and vessels in place in the event of a
spill and conduct practice drills at least twice yearly. The
Stevens bills would allow oil companies to be sued in federal court
if cleanup promises were not met.
   According to Capt. Richard Larrabee, chief of the Environmental
Response Division of the Coast Guard, current federal policy holds
a spiller responsible for timely and effective cleanup of his own
spill.
   ``In effect, if the federal on-scene coordinator determines that
spiller is not acting effectively, then he steps in using federal
resources and cleans it up.''
   In addition, the Coast Guard has contingency plans in place for
each of its approximately 48 ports, including Valdez, Alaska, site
of the Exxon spill.
   States also may regulate the industry. Larrabee said the
eight-member oil consortium in Alaska was required by the state, as
a condition of its operating permit, to develop a contingency plan.
That plan indicated the industry could respond within five hours,
although the consortium was not prepared for a spill of the
magnitude it faced in Prince William Sound, he said.

   A Soviet ship helping clean up the Alaskan
oil spill is being sent home Wednesday because the high-tech
skimmer had trouble siphoning thick goo, frustrated U.S. officials
said Tuesday.
   ``We shouldn't blame the Russians,'' said Bill Rainey, Exxon's
operations manager. ``It was just not the type of oil she was good
in.''
   The 425-foot Vaidogubsky's pumps and machinery jammed often
while siphoning ``mousse,'' the thick goo that hardens as it's
tossed by winds and chilly currents, off the water, said officials
directing the cleanup.
   But they said the ship was unmatched in skimming the softer,
liquid crude that was in the water immediately after the spill
nearly seven weeks ago in Prince William Sound.
   ``If that ship had been available to us in the sound when the
spill first occurred, it would have made a helluva difference,''
said Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, who supervises cleanup work in the
spill zone.
   ``To this point, she hasn't collected a lot of oil,'' he added.
Robbins said officials decided late Monday night to send the ship,
which has been operating out of Seward, home on Wednesday.
   The vessel has been skimming mostly outside the sound, where the
tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into Bligh Reef on March 24 and spewed
more than 10 million gallons of oil into the water.
   The oil has killed hundreds of birds and fish and has fouled
beaches about 450 miles southwest of the spill site, including the
coast of Katmai National Park.
   Robbins inspected Big Smith, Little Smith, Applegate and Seal
islands in Prince William Sound on Tuesday.
   ``I'm encouraged with the progress on this island,'' he said on
Applegate as spots of oil glistened in the afternoon sun. ``It's a
heck of a lot better than when I last visited. ''
   The cleanup crew has been on Applegate for 13 days, hampered by
lack of equipment and frustrated by seeing the rocks re-oiled on
nearly every high tide.
   Authorities also extended by five days the deadline for having
the worst of the oil spill damage cleaned off several islands in
Prince William Sound. The original deadline of Wednesday, timed to
allow seals to use the beaches when giving birth, was pushed back
until May 15.
   ``They don't really start pupping until May 20, but with all the
activity we thought we'd give them a chance to reinhabit the area
and settle down,'' said Alaska Department of Fish and Game
spokesman Bill Pilcher.
   Pilcher said cleanup crews planned to sop up oil on the rocky
beaches with peat moss, stuffing it into oily cracks when the tide
is low, then collecting it from the water when the rising tide
washes it into the sound.
   An oil-spill task force of several boats planned to head out
from Kodiak across the Shelikof Strait to Katmai National Park, a
wildlife refuge hard hit by the spill. But reports of wind gusts
and 12-foot seas kept the vessels in port.
   The 11,400-ton Vaidogubsky arrived with great fanfare last
month, but Robbins said that by the time the Soviet ship reached
Alaskan waters, the oil either was too dispersed or too emulsified
for the ship to work effectively.
   The ship's arrival marked the second time in six months that the
Soviets had sent a vessel to Alaska to provide assistance. Last
year, a Soviet icebreaker worked near Barrow to help free two
trapped, California gray whales.
   The Vaidogubsky worked the southern edge of the Kenai Peninsula,
chasing the rapidly moving oil slick that seeped out of Prince
William Sound and headed southwest toward Kodiak Island and Katmai
National Park on the Alaska Peninsula.
   But the leading edge of the slick broke up before the
Vaidogubsky could do much work. ``We were never able to find oil in
places it could work,'' Robbins said.
   Exxon officials said they didn't know exactly how much oil the
ship had collected because it still was being pumped off Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   GAF Corp. announced Tuesday its earnings rose
12 percent in the first quarter, its last quarter as a public
company.
   Net income for the first quarter totaled $25.4 million, or 91
cents per share, up from $22.7 million, or 79 cents per share, in
the first three months of 1988.
   Earnings rose in the latest quarter despite $31.5 million in
charges resulting from the March 29 purchase of the company by a
group of GAF executives led by Chairman Samuel J. Heyman.
   GAF, a leading manufacturer of specialty chemicals and building
materials, reported total first-quarter sales of $239.3 million, up
from $216.5 in the same period the previous year.
   The company's chemicals business registered its highest
quarterly sales and profits ever, with profits up 27 percent from
$35 million last year to $44 milion, and sales up from $128.6
million to $152 million.

   Vermont is becoming the first state to
ban car air conditioners that use a chemical linked to destruction
of the atmosphere's ozone layer, which protects the Earth from
harmful ultraviolet radiation.
   Car air conditioners are the single largest source of the U.S.
contribution to ozone depletion, according to scientists and
testimony before legislative committees.
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin has hailed the bill, passed May 2 and which
she is expected to sign within the next two weeks, as ``landmark
legislation.''
   ``We are a role model, and we may be a role model for the U.S.
Congress,'' she said.
   Starting with the 1993 model year, the legislation would ban the
sale or registration of cars equipped with air conditioners that
use chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, for coolant. Car air conditioners
were singled out partly because they use CFC-12, considered the
most damaging type of CFC to the ozone layer. Home refrigerators
use a different type of CFC.
   When CFC molecules rise in the atmosphere, they damage the ozone
layer 15 to 20 miles up. Scientists say that lets in extra
radiation that increases incidences of skin cancer and eye disease
and damages plants and animals crucial to the food chain.
   Lobbyist Joan Mulhern of the Vermont Public Interest Research
Group, which supported the bill, said car air conditioners are the
single largest source of CFCs, producing 26.6 percent of the amount
released into the environment.
   Mulhern based her testimony on studies by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency published in 1987.
   ``The connection between CFCs and the ozone layer is not being
debated anymore,'' said state Rep. Curt McCormack, the bill's major
sponsor. ``The argument is when can you have air conditioners
without CFCs.''
   CFCs, developed as a refrigerant in 1930 by a General Motors
chemist, were considered ideal chemicals because they are non-toxic
and noncombustible.
   The chemicals are widely used as coolants and as propellants,
such as in spray cans. Under Vermont's bill, the sale of
CFC-propelled noisemakers and plastic party streamers, as well as
non-commercial or non-industrial uses of CFCs for cleaning
photographic or electronic equipment, would be banned next year.
   Supporters of Vermont's legislation say it is the most
far-reaching of any of the two dozen ozone-protection bills
introduced in state legislatures this year. Only legislatures in
Vermont and Hawaii have passed ozone protection measures.
   Hawaii's governor is expected to sign a bill that would ban the
sale of CFC cartridges for recharging car air conditioners. It also
would raise standards for car air conditioning repair shops.
   Virtually the only opposition to Vermont's bill was from a
representative of General Motors, McCormack said. Legislators were
told that alternative coolants being developed by Dupont were not
as efficient as the those now available, and that new coolants will
require development of compatible lubricants and seals.
   Car dealers didn't oppose it. ``Our stand was really pretty
neutral,'' said Charles Ffolliott, the Vermont representative of
the National Automotive Dealers Association.
   He estimated that more than half of the new cars sold in Vermont
are equipped with air conditioning. Nationally, roughly 90 percent
of all new cars have air-conditioning.
   McCormack acknowleged that relatively low temperatures in
Vermont make the prospects of a summer without an air-conditioned
car more palatable than in some states. Vermont's average high
temperature in July is only 70 degrees Farenheit.
   He also said Detroit lobbyists never specifically said they
couldn't produce CFC-free air conditioners by 1993.
   The bill won widespread support from Vermont's legislators.
   ``Vermont legislators who support this legislation were very
sincere when they said we were willing to do without air
conditioning in our cars,'' said Mulhern.
   The international Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, called for
halving CFC emissions by 1999.
   But at a meeting in Finland last week, attended by delegates
from 81 countries, scientists said ozone depletion is proceeding
more rapidly than was previously believed.
   ``The amount of CFCs produced by Vermont is minuscule, but to
the extent this helps to light the way this could be a very
important breakthrough,'' said state Sen. Stephen Reynes.

<HEAD>R.P. Scherer Reports Quarterly Earnings Decline, Sales Boost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.P. Scherer Corp.'s said Tuesday its
fourth-quarter earnings declined 9 percent from a year earlier,
when profits were inflated by a one-time tax benefit.
   The gelatin capsule manufacturer said it earned $4.83 million,
or 44 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with
$5.34 million, or 50 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   Sales for the quarter were $89.87 million, up 9 percent from
$82.08 million in the same period of 1988.
   Earnings for the fourth quarter of 1988 included an
extraordinary credit of $3.34 million, or 31 cents a share, that
reflected tax loss carryovers, Scherer spokeswoman Jayne Colombo
said. There was no such credit for the fourth quarter of 1989, she
said.
   Earnings for the 12 months ended March 31 were $7.87 million, or
86 cents a share, down 38 percent from $12.81 million, or $1.38 a
share, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1988, the statement said.
   Net income for the fiscal year was reduced by $9 million, mainly
because of a one-time charge involving the pending $440 million
acquisition of Scherer by Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.
   Sales for the 1989 fiscal year totaled $350.59 million, up 21
percent from $290.74 million in the same period a year earlier.
   Earnings for fiscal 1989 included extraordinary credits of $932
million, or 10 cents a share, compared with credits of $3.74
million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier, it said.

<HEAD>Japonica, CNW Spar On Request To Postpone Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNW Corp. and its suitor, Japonica Partners L.P.,
sparred Tuesday over Japonica's request that the transportation
company postpone its annual meeting scheduled for next week.
   Meanwhile, representatives from both sides testified in
Washington before the Interstate Commerce Commission, which wants
to know more about Japonica's financing and plans for Chicago-based
CNW, a railroad holding company.
   Japonica, a New York investment group headed by Paul Kazarian,
released a statement Tuesday saying it was evaluating its options
after CNW rejected a proposal to postpone its scheduled May 16
annual meeting and board election for 30 days.
   Japonica said it sought the delay to give CNW shareholders more
time to fully assess the company's progress toward increasing the
value of its stock.
   Japonica said its proposal included an offer to ``lock in'' for
30 days its takeover bid of $44 a share, or $658 million, for all
the CNW stock that Japonica doesn't already own. The partnership is
CNW's largest shareholder, with an 8.8 percent stake in the firm.
   CNW said in a statement issued later Tuesday it would not
postpone its annual meeting becase ``Japonica's ability to purchase
the company is not affected by the timing of the annual meeting.''
   At that meeting, shareholders will vote by proxy on whether to
replace the company's board of directors with a slate of Japonica
nominees.
   CNW, which owns the Chicago and North Western railroad, a major
freight hauler in the Midwest, is seeking friendly buyout offers
from other companies in an effort to defeat Japonica's hostile bid.
   Chairman Robert Schmiege said Tuesday in Washington the company
was examining one such bid and that more than two other companies
had also expressed interest in CNW.
   ICC Chairwoman Heather J. Gradison gave Japonica until the close
of business Wednesday to provide information about how it plans to
finance a takeover of CNW or face a subpoena.
   Japonica representative Howard Hardesty told the commission his
company would consider the ICC order but he said Japonica doesn't
want to aid and abet other companies working on competing bids to
take over the railroad.
   CNW provides freight service from Chicago to South Dakota, Iowa,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Wyoming and Missouri. It also has a
profitable franchise to carry coal from Wyoming to Montana, which
company officials say is one of the operations that has made it
attractive to takeover bids.
