   President Bush took his wife Barbara to
Memorial Stadium Friday night to watch their eldest son's American
League baseball team, the Texas Rangers, play the Baltimore Orioles.
   George W. Bush, the 43 year-old Texas oilman who heads the
partnership that purchased the Rangers earlier this year, and his
wife Laura joined his parents behind home plate in the skybox of
Orioles' owner Eli Jacobs.
   Before the game, the president, baseball Commissioner A.
Bartlett Giamatti and American League President Bobby Brown visited
the Rangers' and then the Orioles' locker rooms.
   The president and first lady left with the Orioles batting in
the bottom of the sixth inning and the Rangers ahead 6-2. The
Orioles ended up 6-4 losers.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had said earlier it would be hard for
the president to decide for whom to root.
   The Orioles, leading the American League East, have won during
previous presidential visits this year. The president is a keen
baseball fan who captained the 1948 Yale team and keeps his old
first baseman's mitt in his desk.
   He came on opening day with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
again on June 28 when he brought his 13-year-old grandson, George
P. Bush.
   His son's Rangers began the evening in fourth place in the
American League West with a record of 57-49, two more victories
than the Orioles have in their weaker division.
   On a humid 91-degree night, Bush shed his jacket and tie to
watch the game in a white short-sleeved shirt.
   Barbara Bush, who arrived earlier in the day from the family's
vacation home at Kennebunkport, Maine, wore a belted red tunic over
a black skirt. Their son, also in shirt sleeves, wore a blue
Rangers cap.
   All three waved to the crowd before the game. The president and
his wife drew cheers, but his son was hooted when he waved the
Rangers cap.
   All drank large sodas; the president had peanuts and he and his
wife also had corn on the cob. The president took time out to
autograph some baseballs and occasionally they used binoculars to
follow the action.
   The Bushes also were accompanied by Woody Willoughby, an usher
in the White House residence.

<HEAD>Piedmont Pilot Says Not a Hero For Landing Crippled Plane</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS two grafs with report right landing gear might have been

<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot who brought a crippled
Piedmont Airlines jet to a safe landing with one engine cowl
scraping the ground said Thursday he's tried since to think of a
better way of bringing in the plane.
   ``I landed that aircraft probably a thousand times last night to
see if I could have done any better _ and I couldn't,'' pilot Larry
Fuda said during a news conference Thursday at Piedmont Triad
International Airport.
   Flight 1489 originated at Washington National Airport and was
bound for Columbia, S.C., with a stop in Charlotte. It was diverted
to Greensboro when the crew couldn't get the left landing gear down.
   Fuda said he decided to go to Greensboro to avoid the more
congested Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. Fuda said he
liked the emergency equipment at Greensboro and knew Greensboro's
runway was as long as Charlotte's. He also knew a large contingent
of Piedmont people were close by.
   Fuda set the Boeing 737-400 down on its right and nose landing
gear, then settled the plane onto its left engine and skidded to a
halt on the 10,000-foot runway, a shower of sparks coming from the
dragging metal.
   ``I hardly knew that the wheel wasn't there when we touched
down,'' Fuda said.
   Fuda said he had no previous experience like Wednesday's in his
21 years of flying for Piedmont. ``I always wondered what I would
do if it did happen,'' he said.
   Passengers aboard Piedmont Flight 1489, which made the landing
at Piedmont Triad International Airport, said later they thought
Fuda was a hero.
   ``There was no hysteria,'' said Richard Kochan of Washington, a
lobbyist who says he flies a lot. ``But there were a lot of trips
to the bathroom.''
   Fuda's wife, Margaret, said her husband doesn't think of himself
as a hero.
   ``He's just glad it worked out,'' she said. ``The whole crew did
just what they were supposed to do. He says he doesn't consider
himself a hero.''
   ``This time it worked out the way it was supposed to work.
Sometimes the crew does the right things and things don't work out
as well,'' she said. ``He's pooped. I've been giving him kisses and
hugs since he got home.''
   Fuda was not originally scheduled to pilot Flight 1489, said his
neighbor Donnie Campbell, a retired Piedmont pilot.
   ``He was supposed to work Friday night, but they're having a
`Farewell to Piedmont' party in Roanoke (Va.) Friday night, and he
wanted to go to that. So he just picked up a flight that somebody
dropped.''
   ``I'm waiting to see the pilot I picked it up from,'' Fuda said.
   The party is to celebrate Piedmon't final flight on Saturday
before its merger with USAir is completed _ to which Fuda made
jocular reference:
   ``I have made my last and best landing for Piedmont,'' he said.
   The 94 passengers and six crew members safely jumped down
emergency chutes.
   A rubber wheel chock found wedged in the wheel well had
prevented the left main landing gear from deploying, said the
National Transportation Safety Board.
   Piedmont spokesman David Shipley said Thursday it would be mere
speculation to suggest that the chock, a triangular rubber block 30
inches long and 6 inches high used to keep planes from rolling when
they're parked, was left in the wheel well at Washington National.
   ``There's really nothing else to say,'' Shipley added. ``The
airplane's in the hangar, and we estimate it to be in service
Saturday.''
   Only the left engine housing was damaged during the landing,
Shipley said. The 11-month-old plane's left wing and skin were
unharmed. The plane's engine housing is designed to hold up during
that type of emergency landing, he said.
   ``Apparently, (the wing) never touched the ground,'' he said.
``The engine itself is apparently undamaged, but we will remove it
and replace it and run it through a complete structural check as
well.''
   Phillip Powell, an NTSB air safety investigator, said
investigators found the chock wedged between two wheels on the left
landing gear.
   While airline officials doubt the chock was deliberately placed,
they declined to rule out any possibility pending further
investigation, Shipley said.
   The Washington Post in Friday editions quoted Powell as saying
the right landing gear might also have been obstructed.
   Two bent hydraulic lines were found in the right wheel well,
raising the possiblity that a chock might also have been stuck in
the right landing gear and fallen out, Powell said.

   A group that aims to provide a democratic
alternative to China's Communist Party will hold its inaugural
congress of 120 delegates from around the world next month, two
Chinese exiles say.
   The congress will be held secretly in the West and will involve
exiled student leaders and intellectuals, as well as individuals
traveling surreptitiously from China, the exiles said.
   The two men are Wan Runnan, former chairman of the Stone Corp.,
a large computer company that is one of China's most successful
private enterprises, and Yan Jiaqi, former member of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences and a former close adviser to the
deposed Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang.
   The pair made the announcement Wednesday in Manhattan.
   The Democratic Front's formation was announced in Paris last
month in response to the violent repression of pro-democracy forces
in China.
   The Democratic Front plans to serve as an umbrella organization
for student groups, Chinese intellectuals and business executives
inside China and abroad.

   The United States should warn Iran that
support of terrorism in Lebanon will result in a military strike,
said the ground force commander in the ill-fated 1980 Iran hostage
rescue attempt.
   President Bush also should pressure the Central Intelligence
Agency to get information he has indicated the United States needs
to rescue American hostages, to take a strong stand against
terrorism, retired Army Col. Charlie Beckwith said Thursday.
   ``If we don't do this, it's going to keep on getting worse and
worse,'' Beckwith said.
   Terrorists claimed they killed one American hostage, Marine Lt.
Col. William Higgins, on Monday, and have threatened to kill
another, Joseph Cicippio, after Israel captured a Shiite Moslem
religious leader accused of promoting terrorism.
   ``I'd like to see the United States be able to go in there and
eliminate all of those terrorists and bring those beautiful
hostages home,'' Beckwith said. ``I'd like to see us do it in such
a vigorous way that we tell the rest of the world, `Never fool with
the United States again.'''
   Beckwith, a security consultant, led troops in the aborted 1980
attempt to rescue American hostages being held by Iran. Eight
Americans died in that mission.
   Beckwith criticized the CIA as not being active enough since
director William Casey died in 1987.
   The CIA relies too heavily on electronic wizardry and has
forgotten about the need for ``a pair of good solid eyeballs, and a
good human being on the ground,'' he said.

   Here is a state-by-state look at wildfires burning in the West:
   IDAHO: Hundreds of lightning-caused fires have joined to form
huge blazes in forests in the western and central part of the
state, burning 98,000 acres by Thursday. Cool, moist weather
overnight helped firefighting efforts. Although warmer weather is
predicted for the weekend, fire bosses say there is little chance
of the lightning that sparked many of the fires 12 days earlier.
   OREGON: Fires east of the Cascades have burned more than 93,000
acres. About 650 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., were brought in
to help fight a 13,300-acre blaze in the Monument Rock Wilderness,
70 miles southwest of Baker. A 23,300-acre fire burned on the
boundary of the Eagle Cap Wildneress area northwest of Baker.
   CALIFORNIA: More than 35,000 acres have burned, and the biggest
active blaze was a brushfire in the Cleveland National Forest
southeast of Los Angeles. The 10,800-acre blaze was 60 percent
contained, but was burning toward rough terrain three miles from
the Palomar Observatory, which houses the nation's largest optical
telescope. Scientists were forced to shut down the observatory
Thursday for fear that ash would damage the instrument.
   MONTANA: An 800-acre blaze in the Custer National Forest was
contained, but a fire on the Crow Indian Reservation southeast of
Billings quickly spread to 500 acres and threatened two mountain
cabins.
   WASHINGTON: Crews were mopped up an 850-acre forest fire in the
Pasayten Wilderness near the Canadian border.

   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich said today
the Democratic congressman threatening to expand allegations of
possible misconduct against him is ``almost irrational.''
   Rep. Bill Alexander of Arkansas on Thursday made public a letter
to the House ethics committee in which he predicted his original
complaint ``may have only scratched the surface.''
   ``There could well be over 200 additional instances of
potentially unethical, illegal or criminal conduct by Mr.
Gingrich,'' Alexander said, declining to give reporters specific
information on the allegations.
   ``I think in terms of the substance of the charges you have an
almost irrational Democrat in Bill Alexander, who is wandering
around wildly saying things and I am comfortable after the ethics
committee investigates it that they are going to say there is
nothing to the charges,'' Gingrich, R-Ga., said on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America'' program.
   Gingrich, who filed charges that led to the resignation of Jim
Wright, D-Texas, as House speaker, said ``a number of very powerful
Democrats said they were going to destroy me, that they would get
even and, in that sense, of course I'm battling for my (political)
life.''
   In an interview Thursday with WAGA-TV in Atlanta, the Georgia
lawmaker said: ``When you hear a politician say he has 200 hidden
charges he may eventually file, you know he has a lot of baloney.''
   Alexander said he wouldn't file an expanded complaint against
Gingrich until at least September.
   His April complaint to the ethics committee focused on an
investment partnership formed by Gingrich to promote a book he
wrote with his wife and another person.
   Alexander accused Gingrich of possibly violating campaign
finance law, House limitations on outside income and a rule
prohibiting receipt of gifts from people with a direct interest in
legislation.
   The ethics panel has hired a Chicago law firm to recommend
whether it should begin a formal investigation.
   Alexander said other allegations could involve:
   _The possible failure of Gingrich to disclose substantial, and
potentially illegal, campaign contributions he made through his
campaign committee during 1986.
   _Information that contributors to the book promotion partnership
were ``recipients of substantial federal grants and loan
guarantees, including at least one major award under the
politically controlled housing programs mal-administered by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.''
   _The propriety of Gingrich's management of a former political
action committee that may have raised hundreds of thousands of
dollars for candidates, but only donated a miniscule portion of the
money to those running for office.
   _Use of official stationery and congressional free mailing to
promote the personal business endeavors of friends.
   _Improper settlement of personal and corporate debts incurred by
Gingrich's campaign committee and the possibility that Gingrich
improperly enriched himself in a questionable real estate
transaction.

   Israeli officials said today they will consider
making a hostage exchange with Shiite Moslems in Lebanon if they
provide a list of prisoners they want freed from Israeli jails.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told reporters in Jerusalem that
Israel was ``waiting for proposals'' from the Shiites. ... ``We
hope we will get some proposals and it will be the end of the
crisis.''
   Shamir's top aide, Avi Pazner, said Israel was awaiting the
specific list of prisoners whose freedom the Shiites seek. The list
was promised in a statement from a militant Shiite faction in
Beirut on Thursday night.
   After the faction, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, on
Thursday suspended its threat to kill U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel will examine the demands
``on a positive basis.''
   The ``freezing'' of the death threat came just minutes before a
deadline set by the group for killing Cicippio unless Israel handed
over the Shiite clergyman it kidnapped last week from his home in
south Lebanon.
   Another Shiite Moslem faction that was holding Marine Lt. Col.
William Higgins hostage said it killed him Monday because the
clergyman, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, was not freed by Israel.
   Israel radio quoted Shamir as saying Israel was moving closer to
starting negotiations to free three captured Israeli soldiers in
Lebanon. Israeli said it abducted Obeid on July 28 hoping to swap
him for the three soldiers.
   Israel has said it will also try to secure the release of 16
Western hostages, including Cicippio and seven other Americans.
   Earlier today, Shamir discussed with Rabin, Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens and Finance Minister Shimon Peres the demands made by
the Revolutionary Justice Organization, an offshoot of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Peres, who is also vice premier, was asked after a meeting with
Shamir whether Iran was actively involved in the process. ``I'm
hopeful,'' he replied.
   In its first statement, the Revolutionary Justice group demand
that Obeid be freed. After suspending the threat to kill Cicippio,
it also demanded that Israel release ``a number of'' Lebanese and
Palestinian prisoners.
   While the statement did not mention Israel's offer to exchange
Shiite prisoners for Israeli POWs and foreign hostages, Israeli
officials and commentators saw the halting of the threatened
killing of Cicippio as a sign the Shiite radicals were ready to
deal.
   ``If indeed there are real grounds for the report on a proposal
for prisoners exchange, we shall examine it on a positive basis,''
Rabin told reporters in Jerusalem Thursday night.
   Israeli officials noted the Shiite demands did not mention the
Israeli air force navigator and two soldiers believed held by
Hezbollah, and said Rabin's statement was meant to solicit a
specific response regarding them.
   Akiva Eldar, a leading columnist for the daily Haaretz, said
Israeli officials were not taking seriously demands to release
prisoners from the 19-month Palestinian uprising, which could
include more than 8,000 detainees.
   Peres told an American Jewish group that any negotiations would
be complicated and lengthy, and an army general who managed
Israel's last prisoner exchange said it would take ``a long time
and great patience'' to make a deal.
   Maj. Gen. Moshe Nativ told Israel radio that the process would
begin with unreasonable Shiite demands and Israel would counter
with insistence on first seeing the three soldiers believed held by
Hezbollah or allied factions.
   Nativ was in charge of negotiations that led to the exchange of
three Israeli soldiers for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in a deal
with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command in 1985.
   He said any negotiations over the 16 Western hostages would be
more complicated because other countries were involved.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>First Senior U.S. Official In 15 Years Visits Ethiopia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABEBE ANDUALEM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first senior U.S. official to
visit Ethiopia since its 1974 Marxist revolution arrived today for
talks on this nation's 27-year civil war and stability in the Horn
of Africa.
   Herman J. Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, told reporters after arriving that he has ``a long agenda
of issues'' he is prepared to discuss ``in a frank and fair
manner.''
   He is to spend two days in this strategic but impoverished
nation that is the Soviet Union's staunchest ally on the continent.
   That friendship with Moscow soured once-warm relations between
Washington and Addis Ababa after President Mengistu Haile Mariam
Mengistu and a clique of fellow military officers ousted the
Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and the Soviet Union became
Ethiopia's biggest patron in 1977.
   Cohen was expected to meet Foreign Minister Berhanu Bayih this
afternoon and Mengistu on Saturday before leaving Sunday for Sudan.
   He said that besides Ethiopia's civil war and regional conflicts
he plans to discuss economic issues and the return of refugees in
the region.
   He also was expected to discuss money the United States says
Ethiopia still owes from weapons it purchased years ago.
Discussions on economic growth will be handicapped by U.S. laws
that deny development aid to countries that owe money for arms and
are accused of human rights abuses.
   Cohen's visit comes a day after Amnesty International published
a report charging that Ethiopia is among the worst offenders in
Africa in failing to ratify international human rights covenants.
   The London-based organization's report said thousands of
suspected political opponents in Ethiopia are imprisoned for months
or even years without trial and that many are tortured. Others
vanish without explanation, it said.
   Cohen's concern for refugees involves hundreds of thousands who
have fled wars in neighboring Sudan and Somalia and are living in
refugee camps in Ethiopia, while large numbers of Ethiopians have
fled to Sudan to escape their country's northern civil war.
   Ethiopian refugees also remain in Somalia, where they fled a
decade ago after Ethiopian troops backed by Soviets and Cubans
repulsed a Somali invasion.
   The American official's visit comes after several appeals from
Mengistu for improved relations.
   After he seized power, Mengistu's government threw out the U.S.
Military Assistance Group and closed the American government's
information service. Washington retaliated by suspending its
technical assistance program, then the largest in Africa.
   The United States and Ethiopia also withdrew their ambassadors,
leaving charge d'affaires to head their embassies.
   There was little contact until the 1984-85 famine, when the
United States was the biggest donor of emergency food.
   Cohen initially was to visit Ethiopia at the end of May but that
trip was postponed by an attempted coup in Addis Ababa.
   He arrived from Egypt where he met with President Hosni Mubarak
and reportedly discussed the civil wars in Ethiopia and Sudan.
Guerrillas in northern Eritrea want independence from Ethiopia
while southern Sudanese want more autonomy. All the rebels belong
to ethnic minorities.
   The U.S. Embassy said Cohen is the first U.S. official to visit
Ethiopia in the 15 years.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Brock Adams says he will press on with
his proposal to require new oil tankers to be built with double
hulls despite its narrow rejection by the Senate.
   ``We were close and there is no stopping me now,'' Adams,
D-Wash., said Thursday following the 51-49 vote to table, and thus
reject, his amendment to a pending bill tightening oil tanker
safety regulations and creating a special fund to clean up oil
spills.
   Adams' amendment would have required double hulls and double
sides on all new tankers over 20,000 deadweight tons that operate
in U.S. waters.
   It was prompted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska's Prince
William Sound earlier this year, which Adams said might not have
grown into the nation's largest oil spill ever if the vessel had
been equipped with a double hull.
   The pending bill would require that the secretary of
transportation study for one year the use of double hulls and
require them in new tankers unless it is found they won't enhance
tanker safety, or other structural requirements were found to be
better.
   ``None of us are naval architects,'' said Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., who moved to table Adams' amendment. ``I don't think we are
absolutely competent to make a final decision.''

<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Fang Lizhi fired from academic

<TEXT>
   China said today that its crackdown on dissent
will not endanger intellectuals, but it also announced that a
prominent dissident holed up in the U.S. Embassy has been fired
from an academic board.
   Also today, the government declined to comment on a report that
senior leader Deng Xiaoping is seriously ill with prostate cancer.
The official Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong office described the
report as a mere rumor.
   An unsigned commentary in the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily said China will continue to respect its intellectuals'
knowledge and talent, even though some participated in the recent
pro-democracy movement that the government calls a
``counter-revolutionary rebellion.''
   ``China needs a strong intellectual force for modernization. ...
We should thoroughly implement Deng Xiaoping's policy to `respect
knowledge, respect talent' and use intellectuals to achieve the
modernization goal,'' it said.
   The crackdown ended a period of relatively free political
debate. Chinese now are urged to report on friends and family and
must participate in political study sessions reminiscent of the
ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   The commentary called those who took part in the student
movement ``scum'' and ``enemies of the party and of the people.''
It said, ``It is in the interest of the workers, peasants and
intellectuals to punish them.''
   ``Those who were under the influence of the wave of bourgeois
liberalism ... will elevate their understanding and continue to
make contributions'' to China's modernization program, the
commentary said.
   Fang Lizhi, the dissident who evaded arrest by seeking refuge at
the U.S. Embassy, has been relieved of his position on the Academic
Degrees Committee under the State Council, China's Cabinet, is no
longer qualified to tutor doctoral students, Xinhua News Agency
reported.
   Fang, who entered the U.S. Embassy with his wife shortly after
the June crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, already had been
relieved of his posts at the Natural Dialectics Research Society
but apparently still retains his main job at the Beijing
Observatory.
   Several other dissident intellectuals also have been removed
from peripheral positions.
   The government issued arrest warrants for Fang and his wife,
professor of physics Li Shuxian, for allegedly inciting the
pro-democracy protests, and has demanded that the U.S. Embassy turn
them over to Chinese authorities.
   China's Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the report by
Japan's Jiji Press today that Deng is seriously ill with prostate
cancer.
   Quoting unidentified Chinese sources, the Japanese news agency
said the senior Chinese leader's condition had suddenly worsened a
few days ago. Emergency medical personnel were sent to care for him
at his summer resort near Bo Hai Bay, east of Beijing, Jiji said.
   An employee at the Foreign Ministry's Information Department
said he had received many queries about Deng's health but could
respond. There was no answer tonight at the Communist Party's news
office.
   Deng was last seen in public June 9, when national television
showed him congratulating top army officers on having ended the
pro-democracy protests. He spoke in a strong voice and appeared
more alert and healthy than he had for some months. He is widely
believed to suffer from prostate problems, and over the past few
years there have been periodic reports he is very ill or dying.
   The Beijing Daily today said the army has chosen 36 people to
travel around the country to ``tell the whole nation how they,
bearing the fate of the party and the country, protected the
socialist system'' by helping troops crack down on the popular
student movement.
   The group includes soldiers, armed police and a woman who said
they helped 164 soldiers hide from angry protesters.
   The move is part of a campaign to publicize the official version
of the events of June 3-4, when troops marched through Beijing and
fired on unarmed civilians to drive student protesters from
Tiananmen Square.
   Xinhua has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that
thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly
1,000 were injured.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the
death toll may have been as high as 3,000.

<HEAD>Blacks Suffer From `Hypersegregation' in Major Cities, Study Finds</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with two grafs to RECAST and fix typo. Picks up 3rd graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Various forms of segregation that isolate blacks
in major cities, depriving them of opportunities and resources, are
creating a separate society of underachievers, researchers say.
   The authors of a study released Thursday by the University of
Chicago call such multi-layer discrimination ``hypersegregation.''
   Professors Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton say they found that
hypersegregation exists in 10 cities, and that those cities account
for 29 percent of the country's urban black population. Chicago was
found to be the most hypersegregated city.
   ``There is a small set of cities in the United States where
blacks experience more extreme segregation than believed in the
past,'' said Massey, a professor of sociology and director of the
school's Population Research Center.
   ``While the cities are small in number, they house a relatively
large percentage of blacks.''
   In the study _ published in today's editions of Demography, the
journal of Washington-based Population Association of America _
Massey and Denton focused on five measures of segregation:
   _ The degree to which neighborhood percentages of minority-group
residents correspond to the citywide minority percentages.
   _ The degree of potential contact between whites and members of
the minority group where the latter live and work.
   _ The extent to which minority neighborhoods are clustered.
   _ The degree to which minorities are settled in and around the
city center.
   _ The amount of physical space occupied by a minority group.
   Hypersegregation occurs when at least four of those measures
apply, Massey and Denton said.
   Using data gathered in 1980 by the U.S. Census Bureau, the
researchers used the five measures to compute housing patterns for
blacks and Hispanics in 60 metropolitan areas.
   In Chicago, blacks had an index above .750 on each of the five
measures. A reading of .600 is considered high, researchers say.
   The study found hypersegregation of blacks in nine other cities:
Baltimore; Cleveland; Detroit; Gary, Ind.; Los Angeles; Milwaukee;
Newark, N.J.; St. Louis; and Philadelphia.
   The researchers found no hypersegregation of Hispanics in the
nation's urban areas.
   Housing patterns that fall into any one of the five categories
are troublesome because they isolate a minority group from
amenities, opportunities and resources that affect social and
economic well-being, the researchers said.
   Language is the best and most sensitive indicator of social
isolation and creation of a divergent cultures, Massey said.
   ``Black English vernacular is becoming more prevalent and almost
a separate language,'' he noted. ``It has its own diction and
structure, and it is because of isolation. The two groups don't
interact. They are not sharing a common language.''
   The demographics of blacks and whites are different, with blacks
having a higher infant mortality rate and a shorter life
expectancy, Massey said. Black child-bearing is concentrated
between ages 18 and 25, while whites generally delay having
children until later in life.
   ``It is like living in two different nations,'' Massey said.
   Hispanics experienced lower degrees of segregation overall.
   The differences in treatment of the two minority groups are not
easily explained by socioeconomic factors, he said _ which leaves
racism.
   ``Hispanics are primarily white,'' he said. ``They are
apparently more accepted as neighbors than blacks. There is
something about blacks that disturbs whites. It is a complex
psychological process.''

   Iran's president, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
today said he would help find a solution to the hostage situation
in Lebanon and urged the White House to approach the problem in a
reasonable manner, Tehran radio said.
   ``These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not
solve the problems,'' the president said during his weekly prayer
sermon at Tehran University. ``Come let us approach the problem
reasonably. We too will help solve the problems there, so the
people of the region can live in peace and harmony,'' he said in
the broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions,
the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent
solutions,'' Rafsanjani said.
   However, Rafsanjani also said the United States must take the
initiative by pressuring Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Shiite Moslem cleric it kidnapped from south Lebanon a week ago.
   If the U.S. responds by saying it cannot do so, ``this isn't
acceptable to us,'' he said.
   Israel has offered to swap Obeid for the 16 foreign hostages in
Iran and three Israeli soldiers held there.
   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, of which Obeid is reputed to be
a member, rejected such a swap. Hezbollah is believed to be the
umbrella for factions holding most of the foreign hostages.
   On Thursday, one of those factions, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization, suspended a threat to kill American hostage Joseph
Cicippio but demanded that Israel free Obeid and Palestinian and
Lebanese prisoners it holds. It did not say what would happen if
Israel refused.
   On Monday, another faction, the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth, claimed it killed American hostage William Higgins, a Marine
lieutenant colonel, in retaliation for Israel's refusal to free
Obeid.
   ``We do not make any judgment about the group which executed the
American colonel,'' Rafsanjani said.
   ``You cannot condemn the innocent people of Lebanon ... on the
vague basis that some group has possibly killed someone (Higgins)
for a crime,'' he added.
   Higgins' captors accused him of being a spy.
   Rafsanjani, known as a pragmatist who wants to improve Iran's
ties with the West, has not said whether Iran played a role in the
reprieve granted Cicippio. A knowledgeable Shiite Moslem source in
Beirut, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the final word on
Cicippio's reprieve came from him.
   The 54-year-old Rafsanjani is believed to want to end the
international terrorist image Iran developed under the leadership
of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   After Khomeini's death June 3, Rafsanjani moved quickly to gain
the upper hand against a radical faction headed by Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi. The radicals favor Khomeini's
anti-Western views and backing of terrorist groups abroad.

<HEAD>Four Children Drown When Car Runs Into River; Adults Rescued by Boat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WYANDOTTE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car broke through a barrier and
plunged into a river, killing four children, but two adults were
rescued when passing boaters threw them life preservers, police
said today.
   Why the car went into the Detroit River late Thursday was
unknown, Police Chief Edward Rothermal said. He said one of the
survivors, Lawrence Delisle, 28, was questioned Thursday night
``but was in shock and incoherent.''
   Delisle and his wife, Susan, 32, were in stable condition today
at Wyandotte General Hospital, said Justine Kimbler, assistant
director of nursing.
   Rick Stoneburner said he and a companion threw flotation devices
to the adults, who had come to the surface.
   ``The man was so exhausted and the woman was hysterical,'' he
said. ``She said `I am not leaving without my children. Save my
children, they are underwater.'''
   Divers recovered the bodies of the Delisles' four children from
the car in less than an hour, Rothermal said. Killed were Brian, 8;
Melissa, 4; Kadie, 2; and Emily, 8 months.
   Rothermal said Delisle would be questioned again later today.
   Earlier Thursday, divers recovered the body of Katherine
Prather, 7, of Detroit, who fell from her raft in Lake Erie
Wednesday while unsuccessfully trying to rescue her sister, Cheyla,
9.
   Katherine Prather's body was found off Sterling State Park by
divers from the Monroe County Sheriff's Department and state
police, Sheriff Carl Van Wert said. Her sister's body was found
Wednesday.

   Rescuers crawled on their hands and knees
today to reach the site of an Olympic Airways crash, but they found
no survivors from the aircraft that slammed into a mountain with 34
people aboard.
   The British-built Short plane crashed Thursday into 4,800-foot
Mount Kerkis on Samos island. Airline officials blamed the accident
on heavy fog that covered the mountain, the highest in the Aegean
Sea.
   Rescuers searched for the flight recorders, which should contain
information on the plane's equipment and any conversations
involving the pilot.
   Transport and Communications Minister Nikos Gelestathis said the
plane, which was flying to the island from Salonica in northern
Greece, carried 31 passengers, including an infant, and three crew
members. All were Greek.
   Rescuers said they apparently were killed instantly when the
aircraft hit the mountain.
   ``Unfortunately, we could do nothing, I checked every body I
could find,'' said Emmanuel Karlas, a doctor from a village on this
eastern Aegean island within sight of Turkey's southwestern coast.
   The propeller-driven plane gave no sign of trouble before it
disappeared from radar screens, officials said.
   Only a wing and twin-tail section of the aircraft was
recognizable. The front disintegrated on impact and was just a
black scar on the mountainside.
   Police could identify only four of the charred bodies. Olympic,
Greece's national carrier, was flying in relatives to help identify
victims.
   Helicopters could not land close to the crash site and rescuers
crawled up the mountainside on hands and knees for 90 minutes in
the dark.
   The steep terrain prevented them from carrying down the dead.
   ``We'll have the helicopters hoist out the human remains, ''
said police officer Panayiotis Kourdonouris.
   Officials ruled out foul play as the cause of the crash.
   An Olympic official who spoke on condition of anonymity said:
``It appears that thick fog in the area at the time played the
villain's role as the pilot flew blindly into the mountain.''
   Gelestathis told lawmakers in Parliament today that a terrorist
act was out of the question.
   Military teams were dispatched to the crash site after a
shepherd reported seeing an explosion on the mountain.
   The Athens airport duty officer, Emmanuel Fragiadakis, said the
control tower lost contact with the plane at about 4:55 p.m., an
hour after it left Salonika. It was scheduled to land on Samos at
5:30 p.m. The plane disappeared from radar screens when it was 25
miles northwest of Samos.
   Olympic officials said the pilot, Petros Moutzoureas, was a
veteran with an excellent flight record. They said the aircraft was
bought in 1981 and was used for inter-island flights.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian forces battled with
howitzers, mortars and tank cannons across Beirut's dividing Green
Line today. Police said two people were killed and seven wounded.
   The shelling kept many Moslems from attending their weekly
Friday prayers.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 516 killed and
2,183 wounded in the 20-week-old confrontation between Gen. Michel
Aoun's predominantly Christian troops and Syrian soldiers in
Lebanon.
   ``They've started early today,'' grocer Najib Masoud said as he
closed his store in west Beirut and headed for a bomb shelter.
``What a life! We are living under the ground like the dead. We
might as well die.''
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said the clash involved the Christian district of Ein
Rummaneh and the adjacent Syrian-controlled Moslem neighborhood of
Chiyah.
   He said the clash started with an exchange of sniper fire then
developed into an artillery duel. It was not immediately clear who
started the clash.
   Shells crashed into apartment buildings on both sides of the
Green Line, which has divided Beirut into Moslem and Christian
sectors since the civil war broke out in April 1975.
   The two fatalities occurred in the densely populated slum of
Chiyah, a stronghold for the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal
militia.
   Amal did not take part in the confrontation, the spokesman said.
   Shell explosions echoed across Chiyah and residents rushed to
underground bomb shelters as calls were blared from mosque minarets
for noon prayers.
   The police spokesman said the shelling of Chiyah did not reach
the nearby slum of Bir el-Abed, where followers of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, attended prayers at the
main mosque. Friday is the Moslem holy day.
   Syrian gunners deployed in Chiyah fired their 130mm
Soviet-designed howitzers at the Christian suburb of Kfarshima,
southeast of Beirut, where Aoun's forces maintain some artillery
batteries.
   Aoun's gunners, the spokesman said, responed by shelling Chiyah
and the Druse suburb of Choueifat with 155mm U.S.-designed
howitzers deployed northeast of the capital.
   The thuds of shell blasts resounded across the bomb-ravaged
Lebanese capital, forcing the few businesses that opened early in
the morning to close.
   Only 200,000 people of Beirut's original 1.5 million population
still live in the city, which has been the site of ferocious
shelling duels since the confrontation broke out March 8. Most of
the evacuees have settled in safer areas in south Lebanon, the
eastern Bekaa Valley and the Christian-controlled mountain resorts
northeast of Beirut.
   The confrontation broke out over a blockade imposed by Aoun on
illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut for
denying the ailing state treasury about $100 million in lost
customs dues annually.
   The Syrians and allied Moslem and leftist forces retaliated by
shelling and besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, home
to about one million people northeast of the capital.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Catholic, escalated the confrontation with
the Syrians by declaring a ``war of liberation'' against their
40,000 troops, deployed in predominantly Moslem sections of the
nation.
   An Arab mediation committee has failed to solve Lebanon's
crisis, rooted in an effort by the Moslem majority to wrest more
power from Christians, who traditionally have dominated Lebanon.
The panel blamed Syria for blocking a settlement.

   There's an athletic shoe company that urges,
``Just do it.'' But when it comes to losing weight, a federal study
indicates that millions of hefty Americans just don't.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that none
of 32 states in a CDC survey could report even half their
overweight people taking the recommended twofold approach to losing
weight: eating fewer calories and getting more exercise.
   The CDC estimates that 34 million Americans _ about one in four
adults _ are overweight by 20 percent or more.
   ``The data suggest that significant numbers are eating fewer
calories, but it's the physical activity that we don't have enough
people doing,'' said Eddas M. Bennett, a CDC epidemiologist.
   In the CDC survey, conducted in 1987 in 32 states and
Washington, D.C., an average of 20 percent of the overweight men
reported that they were following the fewer calories-more exercise
approach. For women, the percentage was somewhat better: 31 percent.
   An average of 44 percent of the overweight men said they were
eating fewer calories, compared with 64 percent of overweight
women. But only 24 percent of the men and 35 percent of the women
said they were increasing their physical activity.
   ``Physical activity appears to be the limiting factor,'' the
Atlanta-based CDC concluded in its weekly report. ``The low
prevalence of increasing physical activity to lose weight may
reflect the sedentary lifestyle of U.S. adults and the emphasis on
diet as a means of weight loss without adequately addressing the
benefits of physical activity.''
   Overall, the percentage of overweight men trying both the
low-calorie and more-exercise approach ranged from a high of 36
percent in Missouri to a low of 13 percent in Maine and Hawaii. For
women, the range was from 19 percent in Washington, D.C., to 42
percent in Utah, with all percentages rounded.
   Ms. Bennett noted that an official 1990 health objective for the
nation calls for at least half of overweight adults to follow the
fewer calories-more exercise regimen. ``We're not going to meet
that objective in any state,'' she said.
   Overweight is defined as being about 20 percent above ideal body
weight for the person's age.

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran
today offered to help find a solution to the hostage situation but
said the United States must pressure Israel to release a kidnapped
Shiite Moslem cleric, Iranian media reported.
   President Bush said he would explore the offer ``to the
fullest'' but that he did not want to raise the hopes of the
hostages' families. Bush also refused to confirm reports he had
planned to take military action if another hostage had been killed.
One hostage was reported killed Monday.
   Israel, meanwhile, was awaiting a list of prisoners that a
Shiite Moslem group in Lebanon wants freed.
   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions,
the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent
solutions,'' Rafsanjani said in a speech carried on official Tehran
radio.
   ``These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not
solve the problems. Come let us approach the problem reasonably. We
too will help solve the problems there, so the people of the region
can live in peace and harmony,'' he said in the broadcast monitored
in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Rafsanjani's comments were made during the weekly Friday prayer
session at Tehran University.
   He said if the United States wants hostages in Lebanon freed, it
must take the inititive by asking Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid, a Shiite Moslem leader abducted by Israeli commandos one
week ago.
   ``We do not make any judgment about the group which executed the
American colonel,'' Rafsanjani said, referring to Monday's reported
slaying of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins by the pro-Iranian
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.
   ``But if the United States wants to take the inititative (in
freeing hostages), it must ask Israel to free the Friday prayer
leader of Jibchit,'' Rafsanjani said.
   If the U.S. responds by saying it cannot pressure Israel into
freeing the Moslem cleric, ``this isn't acceptable to us,'' he
added.
   Israeli commandos last week stole into Jibchit, in south
Lebanon, and kidnapped Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem
clergyman who is the local prayer leader. Obeid also is reputed to
be a spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, believed
to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 16 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed it hanged
Higgins in retaliation for Israel's refusal to release Obeid.
Israel claims Obeid instigated attacks on Israel.
   Another pro-Iranian group, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization, threatened to kill another U.S. hostage, Joseph
Cicippio, but announced Thursday it had suspended the death order.
   It also demanded that Israel free not only Obeid but also
Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners ``within days.'' The group did
not say if the death sentence would be restored if Israel did not
comply.
   There are eight Americans among the 16 foreign hostages in
Lebanon. Cicippio was acting comptroller of the American University
of Beirut when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986. The hostage held
longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   In Washington, Bush was asked if the latest developments
suggested a break in the hostage crisis. ``I'm encouraged, but I
don't want to get the hopes of the hostages' loved ones up once
again to have those hopes dashed,'' he said. He added that had been
engaged in ``an extroardinarily broad exercise of diplomacy'' over
the last several days on behalf of the hostages.
   Had another hostage been killed, The New York Times reported
today that Bush planned to target for attack the Baalbek base of
4,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards in eastern Lebanon. The guards
work closely with Hezbollah.
   Asked about the report, Bush responded, ``If I had made such a
decision, I expect this would be the last place I'd be talking
about it.''
   In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would
examine the new demands ``on a positive basis.'' Four top Israeli
leaders, including Rabin and Prime Minister Yitzkhak Shamir, met
today in Jerusalem to fashion a response to the Shiite radicals'
demands.
   A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Israel was awaiting the list of prisoners the Shiites want freed.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was willing
to transmit to Israel the demands for the prisoner release.
   Israel has offered to trade Obeid, 33, and other Lebanese
Shiites it holds for foreign hostages and three Israeli soldiers
held in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah has rejected such a swap. Sheik Na'im Qassem, a
Hezbollah leader, said there had been no direct or indirect
negotiations with Israel on a prisoner exchange and would not be.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization granted Cicippio a
reprieve 45 minutes before the deadline Thursday that it had set
for killing him.
   It was the third time the group held off on its death threat.
   ``Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states
with whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, we
declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution
with an initiative,'' said a statement by the group.
   None of the mediating nations was named, but press reports in
Beirut have said Iran, Syria and Algeria were believed to have
interceded. Algeria helped secure the release of American diplomats
taken captive at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
   Rafsanjani, known as a pragmatist, has not commented on whether
Iran played a role, but a knowledgeable Shiite Moslem source in
Beirut, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the final word on
Cicippio's reprieve came from him.
   Rafsanjani is believed to want to improve ties with the West and
to change Iran's image as a sponsor of international terrorism.

   Throwing flowers, candy and coins,
more than 1,000 cheering residents of this key Black Sea port gave
a riotous welcome today to U.S. Navy warships cruising into
Sevastopol's historic harbor.
   ``That's for ice cream when you come ashore,'' called one woman
in the crowd as she lobbed a 20-kopeck coin toward the American
sailors lined along the ships' decks in their blinding summer
whites.
   The visiting seamen, who sent dozens of round sailor hats
whizzing to the whistling, waving crowd, were equally excited.
   ``It just feels great to be making history,'' said Greg Marlatt,
medical officer aboard the cruiser USS Thomas S. Gates.
   The good-will port call by the Gates and the frigate USS
Kauffman mirrored a visit last month by three Soviet ships to
Norfolk, Va., in the first such Soviet-American naval exchange in
14 years.
   The U.S. Sixth Fleet's flagship, the USS Belknap, also was to
join but was diverted to be at President Bush's disposal during the
hostage crisis in Lebanon.
   The ships' visit to Sevastopol is the first since World War II.
Three U.S. warships docked in Leningrad in 1975.
   Sevastopol, headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, normally
is a closed city, even to Soviets. But today it opened its gates
wide to greet the American sailors.
   Crewmen were mobbed by beaming Soviets, handed babies to kiss,
asked to pose for snapshots and given rubles, souvenirs and food. A
brass band played marches and two women in traditional costume met
the ship with bread and salt, symbols of hospitality.
   ``My whole soul is happy that we finally did this great thing
and that we will be friends,'' said 18-year-old Zinaida
Kolisinchenko. ``And the American sailors, they are so attractive.''
   Vladimir Zverev, the military commandant of Sevastopol, look
with bemusement at the crowd on the pier. ``We didn't expect so
many people,'' he said. ``This is the biggest reception for a ship
I have ever seen here.''
   Zverev admitted the city is not accustomed to giving such an
open welcome to Western guests, but said, ``it is appropriate given
the state of our relations today.''
   The American sailors, too, commented on the strange sensation of
suddenly being treated as such good friends.
   Aviator Matt Zentry of Seattle, Wash., recalled going through
recognition training to learn how to pick out Soviet ships from
afar. ``And now, here were are right next to them,'' he said.
   ``For so long we thought of them as possible adversaries, and
all of a sudden that is gone in a minute,'' said public affairs
officer Paul Weishautt.
   Above Count's Pier, where the American ships docked, a red
banner proclaimed in English: ``Mutual understanding and trust
between the people of the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. is the path to
peace and security.''
   The Americans will tour state farms, a vineyard, an art museum,
an aquarium, a war museum, and naval installations. They will be
entertained at concerts, eat meals aboard Soviet ships and play
basketball, soccer and volleyball with their Soviet counterparts.

<HEAD>Austria Closes Its Investigation of Bloch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it is closing
its investigation of Felix S. Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of
spying for Moscow, after determining that ``Austria's interests
were not affected.''
   However, Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak also told Austrian
radio that 10 politicians have been asked about their relationship
with Bloch and that their answers will be forwarded to Washington
for its investigation.
   The Austrian-born Bloch served at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna in
1980-87 and was friends with many politicians, including Foreign
Minister Alois Mock.
   In the radio interview, Loeschnak refused to identify the
Austrian politicians asked to fill out questionnaires about their
dealings with Bloch.
   He also said that Austria is leaving it up to the politicians to
respond at their own discretion.
   Some of the 10 have promised to comply, he said without
identifying them.
   Loeschnak said police interviewed an Austrian woman with whom
Bloch had an extended friendship. But their questioning yielded no
evidence that the woman suspected anything about Bloch's alleged
spying activities, he said.
   No charges have been brought against Bloch, who has been
stripped of his diplomatic passport and placed on administrative
leave. He is under constant surveillance in Washington by the FBI.
   Bloch, 54, reportedly had broad contacts with Austrian
politicians and officials, and he regularly attended all kinds of
diplomatic and other parties while he was economics chief at the
embassy in 1980-83 and then the No. 2 until his return to
Washington in July 1987.
   Loeschnak noted the American's contacts with the Austrian
politicians ``have no (relevance) for Austria's security
interests.''
   At a news conference July 28, Loeschnak said the suspicions
against Bloch are ``the affair of the United States.''
   Bloch is the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to be investigated
under suspicion of collaborating with the Soviets. U.S. officials
were alerted to Bloch's possible links with the KGB when they
intercepted an international telephone call arranging a meeting in
Paris in May.
   There, Bloch was filmed exchanging briefcases with a man known
as Pierre, whom the FBI considers a Soviet spy. Bloch says he knows
Pierre as a stamp collector.

   The battle over abortion will involve
young people today as the Vietnam War did in the 1960s, former U.S.
Rep. Bella Abzug told female political activists today.
   ``Abortion is the Vietnam of this nation for young people
everywhere,'' Abzug told the opening session of the National
Women's Political Caucus' Biennial Convention.
   Abzug, a former Democratic representative from New York and a
founder of the caucus 18 years ago, was the first of several
speakers who are expected to address the abortion issue. The caucus
runs through Sunday.
   ``No civilized nation can be allowed to declare an unborn fetus
a person under the Constitution before women are declared persons
under the Constitution,'' Abzug said.
   On Thursday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown
told the steering committee that the Democrats lost a chance to win
the 1988 presidential election by not doing more to garner votes
from women.
   ``In fact, we blew a major gender gap that might have carried
the Democratic candidate for president to the White House,'' Brown
said.
   Brown said he understands ``the frustrations of working in the
coalition.'' But he said those who counsel the formation of a third
party ``ignore the second half of the adage that begins, `United we
stand.'
   ``No matter where the struggle for justice ... divided we will
indeed fall and fail to reach our goals,'' he said.
   ``I have worked in the struggle for civil rights my entire adult
life, and I do not deny the problems of advancing a cause through
the Democratic Party,'' Brown told the steering committee of the
National Women's Political Caucus.
   ``But the alternative is self-righteous failure. It may feel
good when the first speeches are made, but it will be very, very
tragic when the votes are counted.''
   Brown told reporters later that the creation of a women's
political party probably would hurt Democrats more than
Republicans, but he added, ``I don't think it's going to hurt
anybody because I don't think it's going to happen.''
   No action similar to NOW's is expected at the National Women's
Political Caucus biennial convention, according to Irene Natividad,
head of the caucus. The convention, which officially convened
today, is expected to attract 1,500 delegates and guests.
   Brown also touched on the battle over abortion because of
restrictions allowed under a July 3 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
   ``The Supreme Court and the right wing of this country threaten
women's rights and all of our rights,'' Brown said.
   He said the Democratic Party platform supports the right of a
woman to choose whether to have an abortion, as well as such
proposals as an Equal Rights Amendment.
   An invitation to Republican National Committee Chairman Lee
Atwater to address the leaders of the non-partisan caucus was
declined, Natividad said.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with crackdown on two communities resisting
incorporation into a homeland. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The black homeland of
Bophuthatswana is intensifying its crackdown on two communities
that have violently resisted incorporation into the territory, an
anti-apartheid group said today.
   Also today, police imposed restrictions on the funeral of two
slain activists in a township near Cape Town and reported a series
of skirmishes between police and mixed-race youths.
   In other incidents, police said five blacks were killed in three
separate clashes in Natal Province, where supporters of militant
and relatively conservative political factions have engaged in a
three-year power struggle claiming hundreds of lives.
   Bophuthatswana, one of South Africa's four nominally independent
homelands, has arrested a local leader, banned anti-apartheid
groups and restricted a lawyer's access to people in the
communities of Braklaagte and Leeuwfontein.
   Lydia Kompe, spokeswoman for the Transvaal Rural Action
Committee which is opposed to the tribal homeland system, said the
Bophuthatswana government ``is still increasing its efforts against
its opponents'' in the two communities.
   The two neighboring villages were incorporated into the homeland
on Jan. 1 despite protests by many of the estimated 25,000
residents.
   The residents of Braklaagte and Leeuwfontein say they want to
remain part of South Africa and fear they will be discriminated
against by the Bophuthatswana government because of their
opposition to incorporation.
   The homelands are not recognized by any foreign countries.
   Eleven people, including nine policemen, were killed July 1 when
authorities sought to break up a rally in Leeuwfontein arranged by
residents who opposed joining Bophuthatswana.
   Thirty-three people charged with involvement in the fighting
were to appear in a Bophuthatswana court.
   Pupsey Sebogodi, leader of the Braklaagte community, has been
arrested three times this year and remains in detention, said the
Transvaal Rural Action Committee, which was banned from
Bophuthatswana by the homeland government.
   Authorities have threatened to deport the Rev. Eberhard Richter,
a German citizen and Luthern missionary who has served the
Braklaagte community since 1981, Ms. Kompe said.
   A South African lawyer representing the defendants, James
Sutherland, has been ordered to apply for a visa before he can
return to the homeland. The homeland has few formal border posts
and usually no visa is required to visit.
   About 2 million blacks live in Bophuthatswana, which consists of
seven separate pieces of land scattered across north-central South
Africa.
   The Cape Town regional police commissioner, Maj. Gen. Flip
Fourie, imposed restrictions on Saturday's funeral of two
mixed-race activists who died in a bomb blast last month. Police
said Robbie Waterwitch, 20, and Coline Williams, 22, were trying to
plant the bomb in a public toilet when it exploded.
   Fourie said the funeral service must take place indoors and be
addressed only by ordained clergymen. He said mourners cannot march
to the cemetery and cannot display any political posters, flags or
banners.

<TEXT>
   The House, deliberating less than an hour and
ignoring talk of a possible veto, today approved a $286.5 billion
military spending bill that makes wholesale changes in President
Bush's defense program.
   By a vote of 312-105, the House voted to adopt a spending plan
that slashes nearly $2 billion for Star Wars from the president's
request. strictly limits the B-2 stealth bomber program and makes
drastic cuts in the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles.
   Despite the unusually rapid approval of the costly bill by the
Democratic-controlled House, the ranking Republican on the House
Armed Services Committee, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, said
Bush may veto the measure.
   And in advance of the vote, the White House budget office said
the president's senior advisers would recommend a veto on grounds
the measure ``would severely compromise the administration's
objective of providing adequate defense capabilities within
constrained resources.''
   ``They have conformed,'' Dickinson said of the appropriations
measure that conforms to the separate defense authorization bill
the House adopted last week. ``But that still makes it veto-bait in
my opinion.''
   The bill, approved as Congress rushed to complete pending
business before starting a month-long recess later today, slashed
$2 billion from classified programs that include the advanced
fighter and advanced cruise missile.
   The money bill also incorporates the cuts the House made in the
Star Wars anti-missile program, the B-2 stealth bomber and the MX
and Midgetman nuclear missiles in the policy-setting authorization
bill.
   The House cut Bush's request of $4.9 billion for Star Wars by
$1.8 billion, imposed strict limitation on production of the
radar-evading B-2, trimmed $502 million from the $1.1 billion
sought for the MX rail-garrison system and eliminated all $100
million sought for the Midgetman.
   Dickinson said he hoped that when members of the the Senate and
House meet early in September to craft a final version of the bill,
the ``most egregious add-ons and deletions can be modified and
limited to make it acceptable to the administration.''
   But he said as they stand now, he does not support the
authorization and appropriations bills and would recommend that
Bush veto the legislation.
   ``I think it will be vetoed,'' Dickinson said.
   But Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., complained about suggestions that
House-Senate conferees will change what the House did after the
chamber ``worked its will on the defense authorization bill.''
   ``That really borders on the ridiculous. The House has spoken,''
Weiss said.
   The bill adds $893 million to the administration's budget for
the purchase of 24 new F-14 jet fighters and 12 EA-6B Prowlers,
both manufactured by Grumman Aerospace Corp.
   Bush has proposed canceling the F-14D, a carrier-based fighter
plane the House restored in its authorization bill. The House
earmarked about $1 billion for 24 planes over two years.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations
defense subcommittee, criticized the increasing costs of the
Advanced Tactical Fighter and favored spending money on
conventional projects.
   The appropriations bill is designed to provide the money for the
defense programs approved by the House last week. The measure calls
for $286.5 billion in budget authority and $281.9 billion in
outlays, but doesn't include money for the Department of Energy and
military construction.
   The House defense authorization bill totals $305 billion _ $295
billion for the Defense Department and $10 billion for military
nuclear programs handled by the Energy Department.

   A government report today said a ``failure of
police control'' led to the deaths of 95 people who were crushed in
a surging crowd at a soccer match, and it recommended new safety
measures for all stadiums.
   The 71-page report said authorities at Hillsborough Stadium in
Sheffield did not recognize how big their job would be or know how
to cope when problems developed in the opening minutes of an April
15 Football Association Cup semifinal.
   After the report's release, Sheffield's top police officer,
South Yorkshire Chief Constable Peter Wright, submitted his
resignation, and David Duckenfield, who was in charge of police at
Hillsborough, was suspended pending further review.
   Wright said he accepted ``full responsibility for police
action'' which had ``unraveled like a hand-knitted rug, with
terrible consequences to the families who lost loved ones.''
   The report said drinking by ``an unruly minority'' of fans and
``confused and inadequate'' signs and tickets issued by the clubs
aggravated the problem.
   But it primarily blamed senior police officials.
   ``Neither their handling of problems on the day nor their
account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership
expected of their rank,'' it said. ``The main reason for the
disaster was the failure of police control.''
   The crush occurred when fans in a standing-room section near the
field were crushed against a steel fence by hundreds of people who
surged into the stadium behind them.
   The report recommended a 15 percent reduction in standing-room
sections at British soccer stadiums and better safety procedures
near the steel fences designed to keep rowdy fans off the field.
   The report was sent for review to the Home Office, where
Secretary Douglas Hurd said officials had failed to learn from past
problems, including the Heysel riots in Brussels and the Bradford
city fire that killed more than 50 people in Britain.
   ``The tragedy would not have occurred if lessons learned in the
past had been properly applied,'' Hurd said.
   Rogan Taylor, president of the Football Supporters Association,
said he was pleased with the report but that it did not eliminate
the possibility of future stadium tragedies.
   ``When 50,000 people gather together, there's a risk of
something like this happening,'' he said. ``I think his report is
trying to reduce that risk.''
   A lack of advance work and inadequate communication led to a
buildup of fans outside the Leppings Lane entrance to the stadium,
where Liverpool was playing Nottingham Forest, the report said.
   Once police ordered a large gate be opened to let fans in, just
before kickoff, there was inadequate effort to direct them away
from an already packed standing-room section.
   A surge of hundreds of Liverpool fans into the area, known as
Pen 3, pushed those already there forward, crushing victims against
metal fences or concrete floors and walls, it said.
   ``Failure to cut off access to the central pens'' was the main
cause of the tragedy, Justice Peter Taylor, who headed the inquiry,
said in the report.
   ``They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities
had been laid down. ... When the influx entered Pen 3 the layout of
the barriers afforded less protection than it should and a barrier
collapsed. Again the lack of vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish
reaction.
   ``The club and police should have realized that the turnstile
area could not easily cope with the large numbers demanded of it
unless they (fans) arrived steadily over a lengthy period.''
   Officials said the report's recommendations should be
implemented to insure safety during the new English soccer season
starting Aug. 19.

<HEAD>Violinist Entered Drug Clinic, Ex-Wife Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A concert violinist once billed as the ``Mick
Jagger of classical music'' has reportedly entered a New Hampshire
drug clinic after being arrested on drug charges last week in
Massachusetts.
   Susan Davis, the ex-wife of Eugene Fodor Jr., told The Denver
Post that Fodor entered the clinic Tuesday, but she did not
identify it.
   An official with New Hampshire's Office of Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Prevention told The Associated Press the state has at least
10 private substance abuse treatment programs. Of the program
officials reached by telephone Thursday and today, none offered any
information about Fodor being in treatment.
   Fodor, a 39-year-old Denver native and winner of the 1974
Tchaikovsky Violin Competition in Moscow, was arrested July 27 on
charges including possession of heroin and cocaine. He was released
from the Edgartown, Mass., jail Monday on his own recognizance.
   Fodor also was charged with breaking and entering with intent to
commit a felony after allegedly entering an unoccupied room at a
Martha's Vineyard hotel. Police said they seized 20 grams of
heroin, some cocaine and a dagger from the violinist.
   Davis, who lives in the Washington suburb of Vienna, Va., said
Fodor called her before entering the 12-step drug rehabilitation
and counseling program. ``He wants to do it,'' she said.
   Davis, who married Fodor in 1978 and divorced him in 1985, said
she could not explain how he apparently became dependent on
narcotics.
   ``I think everyone is confused,'' she said. However, ``if your
identity is tied up in what you do, and things are not going the
way you think they should, you're totally frustrated and very
vulnerable and emotional.''
   After great initial promise, including an RCA Records contract,
Fodor's international career failed to take off and was in relative
decline recently, though he had concert bookings.
   ``Early in his career, before his feet ever touched this country
from Moscow, he was billed as the Mick Jagger of classical music
and a playboy. He came back to this whirlwind and had 90
engagements in his first year,'' Davis said.

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 Chinese swamped government
offices for a third day in a row Friday, apparently prompted by
rumors it was easy to gain asylum in Belgium, officials said.
   ``We don't know who started the rumors, but there is not a grain
of truth to it,'' said Justice Ministry spokesman Jean-Francois
Raskin.
   Almost all of the Chinese have been coming from the Netherlands,
he said. Others have driven in from France and West Germany. Most
work illegally in restaurants or the garment industry in those
countries and have no official documents, he said.
   Since Wednesday, they have lined the street leading to the main
refugee center in Brussels. They have not been deterred by official
leaflets explaining the difficulties of gaining refugee status.
   Raskin said all requests that have been investigated during the
recent surge have been turned down. Instead, the applicants have
received orders to leave Belgium. ``Police have increased controls
along the border,'' he said.
   Newspapers reported the confusion may have arisen after the
Justice Ministry said that following the crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement in Beijing, Chinese already living in
Belgium could ask for an extension of their residency permits.
   Belgium approved legislation last year to limit foreign
refugees, arguing it wanted to stop those people who falsely claim
to be political refugees but only come to Belgium to find work.

<HEAD>Sandinistas, Opposition Agree Contras Should Be Disbanded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said today the
Sandinista government and opposition groups have agreed that the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels should be disbanded.
   The government also said it would suspend the military draft for
five months, starting in September, to ease tensions with the
opposition and to help keep the war from flaring up.
   Ortega, who will attend a two-day Central American summit this
weekend, said he will insist at the summit that camps housing
12,000 Contras and thousands of their dependents in southern
Honduras be disbanded.
   Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo has also been saying for
some time that his country finds the Contras a burden.
   The summit, involving the presidents of El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Guatemala and Costa Rica, is part of a regional peace plan that
aims to negotiate an end to the Contra conflict and to the leftist
guerrilla war in El Salvador. It is being held in the Caribbean
beach resort of Tela.
   The talks Saturday and Sunday will concentrate mostly on
Nicaragua.
   Both the United States and Contra leaders are resisting the move
to disband the Contras and want to postpone such a move until after
Nicaragua's government holds free and fair elections Feb. 25, as
promised.
   The agreement to back disbandment was reached after 22 hours of
talks between Sandinistas and leaders of 20 opposition parties. The
talks recessed Thursday night.
   Sandinista leaders also said they planned to suspend the
military draft from September until after the February elections in
an effort to ease tensions with the opposition and de-escalate the
war.
   The talks were called by the Sandinistas to reform Nicaragua's
election laws to accomodate opposition objections that their
candidates were not allowed to campaign freely in past elections.
   Past constraints on the opposition included news censorship.
   The agreement on disbanding the Contras ``calls on the
presidents of Central America to push forward the plan to
demobilize and repatriate voluntarily'' the rebels.
   It also called on ``the region's governments to abstain from
carrying out undercover activities during Nicaragua's electoral
process.''
   The Sandinistas also pledged to grant unconditional amnesty to
all people arrested for inciting political disorder.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, visited Guatemala and other Central American nations this
week to urge against disbanding the Contras until after elections.
   Adolfo Calero, a member of the rebel political directorate, said
he was ``elated that President Bush has come out unequivocally in
favor of having the resistance remain as a viable force.''
   The process of democratization in Nicaragua, promised by the
leftist Sandinista government, remains to be seen, Calero said.
``You do not take down the scaffold before the building is
finished,'' he said.
   A senior State Department official in Washsington, briefing
reporters on the Aronson trip, cited complaints that the Sandinista
government is mounting raids against suspected Contra sympathizers
in northern Nicaragua and has failed to create fair conditions for
political opponents.
   All U.S. military aid to the Contras was cut off a year ago and
the rebels now receive a trickle of non-lethal assistance, such as
food and boots.

<HEAD>Toyota to End Use of CFCs by 1995</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's largest automobile manufacturer said Friday
it will stop using chlorofluorocarbons, which are blamed for
hurting the Earth's protective ozone layer.
   By 1995, Toyota Motor Corp. will discontinue use of the gas,
which it uses for cleaning, cooling and foaming during
manufacturing, said spokesman Anthony McMillan.
   Toyota used 2,800 tons of CFCs during 1988, he said. The Toyota
group, which includes affiliated parts suppliers, used 9,500 tons
in that year, McMillan said.
   Toyota's action follows a move by Nissan Motor Co. and Honda
Motor Co, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, to cease
using the gas by the mid-1990s.
   The auto industry consumes 14 percent of all CFCs used in Japan,
makers say.
   In 1987, 38 countries agreed in Montreal to reduce production
and use of the gases. Under the Montreal Protocol, participating
countries must have frozen their consumption of CFCs at the 1986
level by July 1, 1898, and reduce consumption to 5 percent of the
1986 level by the end of 1999.

   Hurricane Dean turned away from Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands and moved slowly northward to the open Atlantic
today, apparently rendering its 85 mph winds harmless.
   All hurricane and flood warnings and watches have been lifted
throughout the eastern Caribbean, officials at the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables said today.
   ``The main thing is that it did what we wanted it do in that it
missed the islands down there,'' said forecaster Bob Case of the
hurricane center. ``It appears now that it's going to be a marine
problem for the next couple of days.''
   The waters north of the islands are heavily traveled by local
craft and cruise ships, but Case said the vessels will be able to
steer around Dean.
   ``Looking at the satellite, it looks like it's going to drift
northward,'' said forecaster Jesse Moore. Dean won't threaten any
land for days ``unless something really strange happens,'' he added.
   At noon EDT, the storm's center was located 210 miles northeast
of San Juan, Puerto Rico, near latitude 21.2 north and longitude
63.9 west. It was drifting slowly northward, and was expected to
pick up speed later today.
   A weakening of upper atmosphere winds that steer the storm kept
Dean away from the islands on Thursday.
   The Puerto Rican National Guard canceled plans to evacuate 2,000
people from flood-prone areas.
   Earlier, repeated warnings on television and radio that Dean was
headed for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico caused a shopping
rush as people stocked up on food, drinking water and buckets,
batteries, candles and tape.
   Dean was not expected to gain much strength today.
   ``It may pulsate a little bit in strength,'' forecaster Hal
Gerrish said. ``Normally when hurricanes slow down they strengthen.
In this particular case I think that's being offset by deleterious
winds at the upper level.''
   Dean, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, became a
tropical storm Monday night and on Tuesday passed the hurricane
threshold of 74 mph winds.

   President Bush said today he would explore
``to the fullest'' an offer by Iran's new leader to help end the
hostage crisis in Lebanon, saying it sounded encouraging but
emphasizing that ``I don't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment.''
   ``This is a brutal process,'' Bush said of the hostages' plight.
   One day after terrorists suspended a threatened death sentence
against hostage Joseph Cicippio, Bush told reporters, ``I was
certainly pleased that the brutal murder that had been threatened
was set aside.
   ``I don't know the total role of any individual country in that
area in all of this but when you see a statement that offers hope
for the return of our hostages, I want to explore it to the
fullest,'' the president said.
   Bush answered several questions from reporters after posing for
pictures in the Oval Office with Republican senators sponsoring
legislation to authorize a presidential line-item veto.
   Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said during a weekly
prayer sermon today at Tehran University, ``These bullyings,
arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems. Come
let us approach the problem reasonably. We too will help solve the
problems there, so the people of the region can live in peace and
harmony.''
   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions,
the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent
solutions,'' Rafsanjani said in a broadcast monitored in Nicosia,
Cyprus.
   Iran is thought to have strong influence over Shiite Moslem
militants holding Americans captive.
   While Bush called Rafsanjani's statement encouraging, White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're always
skeptical of what we hear'' from Iran.
   Bush refused to confirm numerous reports that he had been
prepared to order retaliatory military action if Cicippio had been
killed.
   ``If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the last
place I'd be talking about it,'' he said.
   Fitzwater, talking with reporters later, said emphatically that
Bush had not made a final decision on military action. ``I talked
to the president about this very question before he came out, I
know what he intended to say, I know what he said and I know what
the truth is and I know he did not (make a final decision),'' the
spokesman said.
   Moreover, with hostages still in captivity, Fitzwater said, ``it
is not helpful to be flexing our muscles in public.''
   Bush said he had been engaged in ``an extroardinarily broad
exercise of diplomacy'' over the last several days on behalf of the
hostages. White House officials said he called upwards of a dozen
world leaders to seek their help.
   As for the offer from Rafsanjani, Bush said, ``I am pleased
about that. I don't know what it means fully, but I think the world
is familiar with our policy _ that there will be nothing done ever
that will create a new incentive for taking somebody else hostage.
   ``I feel the burden of going to every end possible to try to
find ... the return of these Americans to their loved ones and to
find out the truth about Col. (William) Higgins,'' a hostage
reported hanged in Lebanon on Monday by kidnappers.
   Asked if recent developments suggest a break in the hostage
crisis, Bush said, ``I'm encouraged but I don't want to get the
hopes of the hostages' loved ones up once again to have those hopes
dashed.
   ``This is a brutal process where you see people paraded before
cameras and the families get their hopes up. My heart is still with
Mrs. Higgins.''
   Noting that the United States is not absolutely sure that
Higgins is dead, Bush said, ``We can't tell her with any definition
what _ of her husband's fate.''
   The president added, ``I don't want to raise hopes beyond
fulfillment but there's reason to be somewhat encouraged.''
   Asked what prompted the freeze on Cicippio's death sentence,
Bush said, ``I like to think a broad-spread appeal to nations in
every corner of the globe had something to do with it. I don't know
for sure. The response I have had on my personal calls and that the
secretary had on his has been heart warming. And it's come from all
sectors and I have been very, very encouraged by that, and where we
go from here, we'll just keep on trying.''
   Asked if Cicippio deserved the full backing of the United
States, in view of the fact that he ignored U.S. warnings to leave
Lebanon, Bush acknowledged that, indeed, Americans had been urged
not to stay in that strife-torn country.
   Even so, Bush said, ``he's an American. He's entitled to the
concern of the president, of these senators, of everybody in our
administration.''
   U.S. Navy units remained in readiness today as reports
circulated that Bush was prepared to use carrier-based aircraft
from the 6th Fleet in a strike against Lebanese terrorists if any
American hostages were harmed.
   Television evangelist Robert Schuller, who prayed Thursday with
Bush in the Oval Office for hostages, said the president had ``made
it clear he would take appropriate action'' if another hostage was
killed.
   The New York Times reported today that Bush had ``all but
decided'' to attack terrorist strongholds in eastern Lebanon,
including the Baalbek base of 2,000 Iranian revolutionary guards,
if a hostage had been killed.
   A White House spokesman reached at home Thursday night, who
spoke only on condition of anonymity, said, ``To my knowledge that
is not true,' but added, ``We just don't discuss those sorts of
things.''
   Cicippio's captors indicated he still could be killed ``within
days'' unless Israel releases unspecified Palestinian and Lebanese
guerrillas as well as the Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israeli
commandos, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   Asked Thursday if Bush would recall any ships, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``I urge everyone to keep in mind,
especially in regard to the ships, that we still have a serious
problem in the Middle East.''
   Asked whether the United States was considering asking Israel to
extradite Obeid for possible involvement in the kidnapping of
Higgins, Fitzwater said only that the Justice Department ``is
looking into the case.''
   A law enforcement source said the FBI is reviewing laws that
allow the arrest and prosecution of terrorists for the kidnapping
and murder of U.S. citizens overseas.
   Fitzwater said the president called at least a dozen leaders in
the Middle East and elsewhere over the past two days.

   A fire in California's Cleveland National Forest has closed an
observatory housing the nation's largest optical telescope until
further notice, although the blaze has shifted away from the
historic facility, officials said today.
   Major fires also burned in Idaho, Montana, Nebraska and Oregon.
The western blazes have blackened nearly 225,000 acres, the federal
Boise Interagency Fire Center reported today. It said more than
21,000 people were fighting the fires.
   About 500 firefighters were brought in to protect equipment and
structures after the 10,780-acre wildfire came within three miles
of the Mount Palomar Observatory, said U.S. Forest Service
spokeswoman Audrey Hagen.
   But she said winds shifted early this morning, pushing the walls
of flame westward, away from the hilltop facility, which also has a
museum and gallery.
   Scientists were forced to cease their work and close the
telescope Thursday to prevent ash from damaging the telescope's $20
million mirror. Observatory officials said today the grounds were
closed to visitors until further notice as a precautionary measure.
   ``We have a lot of unhappy astronomers around here,'' said Bob
Thickston, superintendant of the observatory, owned by the
California Institute of Technology.
   The week-old blaze, in forest that straddles Riverside and San
Diego counties 90 miles southeast of Los Angeles, was less than 60
percent contained, said Forest Service spokeswoman Rosalinda Ewen.
   Elsewhere in the state, a three-day old fire that has burned 600
acres in the Mendocino National Forest was declared 75 percent
contained. The blaze, in steep, remote terrain, was apparently
started by two lost men seeking rescue, said U.S. Forest Service
spokeswoman LaVon Perez.
   In Idaho, cooler weather allowed more than 9,000 firefighters to
get the upper hand on a few of the 38 major fires eating up state
forests today, but fire bosses braced for predicted higher weekend
temperatures.
   ``We're in an increasing warming and drying trend,'' said
Payette National Forest spokesman Vance Persing. ``If we reach the
weather we had several days ago, things could really start
popping.''
   Still, headway was made on one of the most critical fires, the
6,200-acre Fleming Creek blaze near Banks in west-central Idaho. It
was contained late Thursday and could be controlled this weekend.
   The cooler temperatures and higher humidity also allowed final
control on the 4,800-acre King Gulch Fire in the Boise National
Forest, which at one time threatened Idaho City, about 25 miles
northeast of Boise.
   In Oregon, a major fire was contained and crews welcomed Army
assistance in digging trails around smaller blazes that have burned
93,500 acres in the eastern part of the state.
   The Dooley Mountain fire burned across nearly 20,000 acres of
timber and grazing land, killing 26 cattle and forcing the
evacuation of homes and ranches before it was contained Thursday,
said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Gail Aschenbrenner.
   Elsewhere, about 650 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., set up
camp Thursday outside Unity, about 70 miles southwest of Baker and
three miles from a 13,300-acre fire in the Monument Rock Wilderness.
   A 23,300-acre fire on the boundary of the Eagle Cap Wildneress
area northeast of Baker destroyed a small snowmobile hut, but
spared the Lick Creek Guard Station, which is on the National
Register of Historic Places, said Bruce McMillan, Wallowa-Whitman
National Forest spokesman.
   In Montana, fire engines stood by to protect two mountain cabins
as a lightning-sparked fire in dead timber grew quickly to 600
acres on the Crow Indian Reservation southeast of Billings. An
800-acre grass and timber fire in the Custer National Forest in the
state's southeastern corner was contained.
   In Nebraska's northwest corner, a timber fire swept through
canyon country 12 miles southeast of Fort Robinson State Park this
morning, burning at least 3,000 acres. Authorities said the fire,
which broke out Thursday, could be contained later today, but said
winds forecast at 10 to 20 mph could hamper efforts.
   Washington's firefighters were sent to other states after its
fires were declared out.
   Allan West, a Forest Service deputy chief, said at a Washington,
D.C., news conference that fire conditions are extreme to severe in
14 states.
   ``Long-range weather forecasts indicate continuing severe fire
conditions, leaving this fire season with the potential to be as
severe as last year's,'' he said. ``We see no relief through the
month of October in precipitation and temperature.''
   So far this year, more than 39,400 fires have been reported
burning 1.38 million acres. That compares with almost 61,200 fires
covering 2.37 million acres through the same time period last year.

   The House ethics committee has voted to
investigate three lawmakers accused in complaints of sexual
improprieties, two of the members and congressional sources said
today.
   The committee voted in secret session Thursday to conduct
preliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill.,
Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, and Jim Bates, D-Calif.
   William Jarrell, press spokesman for Lukens, said the
congressman confirmed to him that he has been formally notified by
the ethics panel of the decision. Bates said he was also was
formally notified of the committee action.
   Savage's office had no immediate comment. But House sources,
speaking only on condition they not be named, confirmed that he
also would be investigated.
   Three House Democrats filed a complaint against Savage this
month, after news accounts said a Peace Corps volunteer complained
the lawmaker fondled her while he was traveling in Zaire.
   Since the incident, the State Department inspector general has
sent investigators to collect information on Savage's actions
during official foreign travels, according to a House member who
would speak only as an unnamed source.
   News accounts this week said that when Savage was in China as
part of a delegation from the House Science and Technology
Committee, he revised his schedule and went to Hong Kong and South
Korea for shopping and sightseeing.
   Before he moved to Hong Kong, Savage locked himself in a hotel
room to protest the U.S. embassy's failure to immediately get him
on a flight, the accounts said.
   Savage told reporters two weeks ago, ``I did nothing, that's
what I did. This lie was leaked by the State Department for
political reasons.''
   ``They tried to destroy Dr. Martin Luther King with a lie. ...
I'm in good company,'' he said at the time..
   The House Republican caucus, composed of all Republicans, asked
the ethics panel to investigate Lukens, who was convicted in Ohio
on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a
child. Lukens was sentenced June 30 to 180 days in jail and fined
$1,000 for having sex with a teen-age girl. He is appealing.
   Lukens has said his conviction is no worse than drunk driving or
shoplifting. He has criticized House Republican leaders for seeking
the ethics investigation.
   Jarrell, the Lukens aide, said the Ohio Republican ``has already
said he welcomes a full and open investigation where his accusers'
motives and the full record can be brought forth.''
   He added that Lukens would be able to bring the committee
information about the credibility of the teen-age girl and her
mother, which was inadmissible in the courtroom. ``That's a
positive for Lukens,'' he said.
   The complaint against Bates was filed last year by two former
aides, who alleged he sexually harassed female members of his
staff, and pressured congressional employees into doing campaign
work.
   Bates said the committee told him there were ``sworn complaints
from two individuals saying they were sexually harassed and that
congressional resources were used to perform political activity. I
would deny they were sexually harassed and that the staff and
resources were used to perform campaign-related activities _ at
least under my direction.''
   Bates added, ``I look forward to having the matter resolved. It
has gone on for a year without any action. I would like it
resolved. I don't think it warrants a preliminary inquiry, but if
the committee does, we'll cooperate in any way we can.''

   A senior Romanian diplomat charged with
passing secrets to a ``foreign power'' has gone on trial in
Bucharest and faces the death penalty if convicted, an emigre
source said Friday.
   The trial for Mircea Raceanu is taking place behind closed
doors, said the source, a spokesman for the Paris-based Romanian
League of Human Rights.
   Raceanu served for several years in the Romanian Embassy in
Washington in the 1970s.
   The trial was not reported by Romania's state-controlled media,
and a League spokesman told The Associated Press in Vienna it was
not known when it would end.
   A brief announcement from the General Prosecutor's office
carried by Romanian dailies in March said state security bodies had
``uncovered a grave action of betrayal of the interests of the
Romanian people and state'' by Raceanu.
   Raceanu last held the post of deputy head of the Foreign
Ministry's U.S. desk in Bucharest. He was said by emigre sources to
have been detained Jan. 31 as he went with his wife to the U.S.
ambassador's residence to see a movie.
   ``Being caught in the act, and following the investigations, it
has been found that since 1974, when (Mircea Raceanu) was recruited
by a foreign spying service and became its agent, he has been
engaged in steady treasonable action,'' the official Agerpres news
agency said last spring, quoting the general prosecutor's statement.
   It said he managed to supply unspecified ``secret data and
intelligence'' to the unidentified power for which he allegedly
worked.
   The maximum penalty for treason is death, if the alleged
espionage is deemed to have caused grave damage to state security.
The next most severe penalty is 20 years in jail.
   The prominent media attention given to the arrest indicated
authorities wanted to make an example of him following signs of
domestic resistance to the tough policies of President Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   Emigre sources and Western diplomats in Bucharest linked
Raceanu's arrest to a protest letter to Ceausescu signed by six
Communist Party figures, including Raceanu's father, Ion.

<HEAD>NOW Using Personal Checks to Send Message on Abortion Rights</HEAD>

   The National Organization for Women is using
personal checks to lobby against the Supreme Court decision giving
states greater leeway to regulate abortion.
   People who advocate the right to choose can purchase bright
yellow checks that say ``Pro Choice _ Protect Our Right to Choose''
and send a political message each time they use their checkbooks,
NOW spokeswoman Patricia Ireland said Thursday.
   The average person writes 300 checks a year and the recipients
are ``a captive audience,'' said Priscilla Fenton, founder of the
Seattle-based Messsage!Check Corp.
   ``About six to 10 people see each check as it goes through the
banking system _ from the people you write the check to all the way
to the Federal Reserve,'' said company spokeswoman Jane Lockwood.
   Asked what sparked the idea pro-choice checks, Ireland replied:
``Money.''
   ``Everybody has to spend it and this is a way that sends a
message with the money,'' she said. ``It's much more of a
consciousness-raiser than a fund-raiser. And it demonstrates the
economic clout of pro-choice supporters.
   ``A lot of people have been supporters but not activists since
the Supreme Court decision went down,'' said Ireland, adding that
the checks, which have been available about three months, give them
a chance in everyday life to show their support for the pro-choice
cause.
   ``If I'm standing in a supermarket line and I write my check to
the cashier _ in some way it gives you the opportunity to talk to
people about the issue,'' she said.
   NOW has been distributing checks that say ``Equality for Women''
through Message!Checks for about four years, Ireland said.
   Fenton, a former fund-raiser, formed Message!Checks about four
years ago to help non-profit organizations get their messages
across without spending much money.
   In addition to NOW, the company prints checks with messages for
the Vietnam Veterans of America, Greenpeace, Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, and several other groups.

   China said Friday it would not crack down on
intellectuals even though some participated in recent pro-democracy
protests, but it also stripped leading dissident Fang Lizhi of his
post on an academic board.
   The Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, refused immediate comment on
reports by a Japanese news agency that senior leader Deng Xiaoping
is gravely ill with prostate cancer.
   An unsigned commentary in the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily appeared aimed at reassuring China's educated elite, some of
whom have come under sharp attack for supporting what the party
calls ``bourgeois liberalism'' _ Western liberal ideas _ and the
student-led pro-democracy movement.
   ``There has been some concern as to whether the party's policy
toward intellectuals would change. It is necessary to reaffirm that
(it) has not changed and will not change,'' the commentary said.
   It called the intellectuals who took part in the student
movement ``scum of the intellectuals (who) do not represent the
intellectuals'' and ``enemies of the party and of the people.''
   ``It is in the interest of the workers, peasants and
intellectuals to punish them, and the party will protect that
interest,'' it said.
   ``Those who were under the influence of the wave of bourgeois
liberalism ...will elevate their understanding and continue to make
contributions'' to China's modernization program, it said.
   The army's violent crackdown on mass demonstrations in early
June has ushered in a new era of repression. Chinese are urged to
turn in friends and family members who participated in the
protests, and many must attend weekly political study sessions
reminiscent of the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution.
   The crackdown has brought an end to a period of relatively free
political debate. Newspapers once more are under strict party
control, and the works of 10 writers, including Fang, have been
banned.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Friday that Fang, an
astrophysicist, was relieved of his position on the Academic
Degrees Committee under the State Council, China's Cabinet, and of
his qualification to tutor doctoral students.
   Fang, who took refuge inside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with
his wife shortly after the crackdown, already had lost another
minor post but apparently still retains his main job at the Beijing
Observatory.
   The government has issued arrest warrants for Fang and his wife,
physics professor Li Shuxian, for allegedly inciting pro-democracy
protests and has demanded that the U.S. Embassy turn them over to
Chinese authorities.
   Thousands of students, intellectuals and others are believed to
have been arrested for participating in the seven-week movement.
   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, intellectuals were
severely persecuted as ``class enemies.'' Since then, Deng hasd
emphasized the need for skilled and talented intellectuals to help
China modernize.
   The educated elite, however, remains among the lowest paid and
most politically vulnerable of all Chinese.
   In Japan on Friday, the Jiji Press quoted unidentified Chinese
sources as saying the health of Deng, 84, had deteriorated
seriously a few days ago, and that emergency medical personnel were
sent to care for him at a coastal resort east of Beijing. It quoted
doctors as saying they were discussing whether Deng was too ill to
be moved to Beijing, where better facilities were available.
   An employee in the information department of China's Foreign
Ministry said he had received many queries about Deng's health but
could issue no immediate response. There was no answer Friday night
at the Communist Party's news office.
   In another development, Britain's Home Ofice said it has granted
political asylum to three Chinese diplomats and is considering an
application from a fourth.
   A Home Office spokesman identified one of the diplomats given
asylum Nin Hongshan, a second secretary in the embassy's
educational section. He said the others were all middle-ranking
diplomats but would not identify them.
   In New York, two Chinese exiles said a group that aims to
provide a democratic alternative to China's Communist Party will
hold its inaugural congress of 120 delegates from around the world
next month.
   The congress will be held secretly in the West and will involve
exiled student leaders and intellectuals as well as individuals
traveling surreptitiously from China, said the exiles, Wan Runnan
and Yan Jiaqi.
   Wan is former chairman of the Stone Corp., a large computer
company that is one of China's most successful private enterprises.
Yan is a former member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
and a former close adviser to deposed Communist Party leader Zhao
Ziyang.

   Thousands of devoted admirers of Queen Mother
Elizabeth vied to show their devotion to the former monarch on her
89th birthday Friday with flowers, cakes and poetry at her
residence, Clarence House.
   Barry Millard, 7, wearing an Irish Guard uniform, gave the Queen
Mother flowers encased in glass, saluted and executed a crisp
about-face before the grown-up Irish Guards made their annual march
past the residence.
   The Queen Mother, widow of King George VI and one of the most
popular royals, looked cool in a blue, lilac and yellow floral
print dress and a lilac hat. The Irish Guards played several
refrains of ``Happy Birthday'' and the crowd, estimated at 3,000,
joined in.
   She spent about 25 minutes accepting flowers from children and
appeared to have a smile and a word for each one. Servants
circulated afterward to collects armloads of bouquets.
   The party inside the residence was joined by Queen Elizabeth II,
Prince Charles and Princess Diana, the Duke and Duchess of York,
Prince Edward and Princess Margaret's two children, Viscount Linley
and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones.
   Many in the crowd outside were veteran well-wishers and staked
out places early.
   Julia Fox, 24, from Horsham, was the first on the scene, at 4
a.m.
   ``I've been coming here for six or seven years now. I just enjoy
it because it is a chance to see the Queen Mother with other
members of the family,'' she said.
   Emily Coughlan, 64, from Wakefield, said she had been coming
every year for about 15 years. She brought a basket of flowers
including, she said, heather from Balmoral, the royal estate in
Scotland. She also had a big yellow sign saying ``Happy Birthday,
Ma'am.''
   Colin Edwards, a local government officer from Macclesfield,
Cheshire, brought a basket of fruit, three photographs he had taken
of the Queen Mother and a poem.
   Joyce Brereton came from Manchester with a home-baked version of
the Queen Mother's favorite cake recipe.
   The Queen Mother left for Scotland on Friday for the royal
family's annual holiday.
   On Thursday, the National Gallery unveiled an unconventional
portrait of her without her customary hat, wearing a simple dress
and staring almost grimly out of the canvas.
   Alison Watt, the 23-year-old Glasgow artist who painted it, says
she didn't want the portrait to look particularly royal.
   ``She always appears fluffy, light, wearing flowing clothes and
I wanted to make her more solid. She has a lot of character,'' Ms.
Watt said Thursday. ``I didn't want her to come across as a wee
waif.''
   The Queen Mother, Ms. Watt said, was happy with the portrait,
but that could not be confirmed.
   ``I do not know what the Queen Mother thinks of it,'' said a
spokesman at Clarence House on Thursday. ``Presumably she has seen
it because she sat for it, but we do not issue statements on silly
little things like this.''

<TEXT>
   The House today passed a $286.5 billion
defense spending bill and lawmakers struggled to find final
agreement on a savings and loan bailout as Congress rushed toward
its summer recess.
   The military bill, which was approved on a vote of 312-105,
eliminates funds for President Bush's proposed Advanced Tactical
Fighter and Advanced Cruise Missile but restores money for the
F-14D jet that he wants to kill.
   It also slashes nearly $2 billion for Star Wars from the
president's request, strictly limits the B-2 stealth bomber program
and makes drastic cuts in the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles.
   The White House budget office said before the vote that Bush's
senior advisers would recommend he veto the measure because it
``would severely compromise the administration's objective of
providing adequate defense capabilities within constrained
resources.''
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley urged his Democratic
colleagues to support a compromise $159 billion savings and loan
bailout plan, saying Congress cannot start its summer recess
without acting to stem continuing losses in the industry. ``To
delay it or defeat it, that will cost money,'' he said.
   Bush added his endorsement of the compromise plan in a letter to
congressional leaders that said: ``This legislation has been
developed in a bipartisan process. It is badly needed, and must be
enacted without further delay. I ask that the House and Senate
approve this legislation today.''
   Foley told reporters that many in his party have misgivings
about the latest deal negotiated to salvage a rescue plan that has
gone through a host of changes in recent weeks.
   ``I think this bill needs to be passed,'' he said, although the
Washington Democrat said his party had been reluctant to agree to
any plan that would put bailout spending off the federal budget _
as the latest compromise proposes.
   `This is a compromise that we didn't prefer to make,'' he said.
But he said that because Bush ``has been adamant about taking it
off budget, we had to deal with that.''
   The Senate today also passed, on a 99-0 vote, legislation to
boost financial liability for oil spills, create a nationwide
system to clean them up and establish a $1 billion trust fund to
help compensate for damages. The bill was prompted by the accident
involving the tanker Exxon Valdez this year.
   And the House approved a compromise proposal to provide $895
million to farmers suffering crop losses this year from drought and
other weather-related damage. The measure was passed on unanimous
consent, without a recorded vote, and sent back to the Senate.
   During a frenetic day of lawmaking Thursday, there were these
other developments:
   _The House approved an $11.9 billion measure to finance
Transportation Department operations in the new budget year
starting Oct. 1. The measure included language making permanent a
ban on smoking on all domestic airline flights of two hours or less.
   ``This is probably the most popular bill we've passed around
here in two years,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor of
both the existing and the new restrictions.
   _The House, brushing aside a Bush veto threat, gave final
passage to a District of Columbia appropriations bill that included
a provision easing restrictions on public financing of abortions in
the nation's capital.
   _The Senate Appropriations Committee approved legislation that
would reduce the amount of money Congress is expected to spend next
year on mail. The nearly $2 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill
earmarks $80 million for lawmakers' postage, compared with $124.7
million in the bill the House approved earlier this week.
   _The Senate approved legislation that would give Vietnam-era
veterans disability benefits for certain illnesses associated with
U.S. use of Agent Orange.
   The bill provides payments on an interim basis, through April
15, 1992, while providing for subsequent congressional votes to
make the benefits permanent. Benefits would be paid to veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma.
   A broader version is pending in the House.
   Bush administration and congressional negotiators, working late
into the night Thursday, reached agreement on a plan they said
would be acceptable to their colleagues and the White House.
   A House-Senate split over how to pay for some elements of the
relief program had forced new negotiations, raising doubts about
whether lawmakers could meet today's target date for starting the
annual getaway.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and budget director Richard
Darman took part in the talks.
   ``Obviously we've only had an opportunity to make a quick
review, but based on that review ... in the spirit of which the
president sent us here, which was one of compromise, we accept,''
Brady said.
   The pact set the stage for final action today by both chambers,
and GOP leaders voiced confidence they could muster sufficient
votes to pass the bill and send it to Bush.
   Reflecting lawmakers' growing restiveness in the wake of a
series of long work days, Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., chairman of
the House Rules Committee, groused at one point during the S&amp;L
fight that ``90 percent of the people want to get out of here. They
have reservations for vacations.''
   Aside from the S&amp;L bailout, the only legislation that had to be
acted upon before recess was a bill to temporarily extend the
government's debt limit by $70 billion, to $2.87 trillion.
   That was needed to grant the government authority to borrow
enough money to function for the next three months.
   Lawmakers continued to work on 13 government appropriations
bills. But they have until Sept. 30 to get them approved, and thus
were under no pressure to finish the measures before heading home.
   Although much of the argument about financing the S&amp;L bailout
was framed around the technical question of whether the
budget-balancing act could be stretched to accommodate a $44
billion chunk of the overall price tag, the tinge of partisanship
was unmistakable.
   Many Democrats were loath to let Bush use off-budget techniques
to mask the impact of the new spending on the overall federal
budget deficit, which is estimated in the range of $148 billion for
the current fiscal year.
   Some Democrats still believe tax increases eventually will be
necessary to curb the red-ink problem even though Bush has
reiterated his ``no-new-taxes'' pledge of last year's presidential
campaign.
   The compromise reached late Thursday is a hybrid of two
conflicting plans to avoid automatic spending cuts under the
deficit-reduction law.

   Sailors of the first U.S. warships
to visit this Black Sea port were treated like celebrities Friday,
posing for snapshots, signing autographs, kissing babies and even
dodging coins tossed by admirers.
   More than 1,000 whistling, waving Soviets climbed on the pier as
the Aegis-class cruiser U.S.S. Thomas S. Gates and frigate U.S.S.
Kauffman pulled into the headquarters of the Soviet Union's Black
Sea Fleet.
   The port call mirrored a visit last month by three Soviet ships
to Norfolk, Va., in the first such Soviet-American naval exchange
in 14 years.
   ``That's for ice cream when you come ashore,'' called one woman
in the crowd as she lobbed a 20-kopeck coin toward the sailors
lined along the ships' decks in their summer whites.
   ``You have to understand, for Americans to visit us is about the
same as if Martians visited you,'' said a Soviet Navy officer who
would not give his name.
   ``This is great,'' said U.S. navigator George Hughes, dodging a
coin. ``I can't wait to hit the beach.''
   Crewmen were handed babies to kiss, asked to pose for photos and
given rubles, souvenirs and food. A brass band played marches and
two women in traditional Russian costumes met the ship with bread
and salt, traditional symbols of hospitality.
   ``My whole soul is happy that we finally did this great thing
and that we will be friends,'' said Zinaida Kolisinchenko, 18, of
Sevastopol. ``And the American sailors, they are so attractive.''
   The Americans were equally excited.
   ``It just feels great to be making history,'' said Greg Marlatt,
medical officer of the cruiser Gates.
   The city hosted former U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci a
year ago, but Navy public affairs officer Paul Weishautt said this
was the first time U.S. warships had docked at Sevastopol. The 6th
Fleet's flagship, the USS Belknap, also was supposed to visit but
was diverted to be at President Bush's disposal during the Lebanon
hostage crisis.
   Sevastopol is normally a closed city, even for Soviets. But it
opened its gates wide to greet the American sailors.
   Throughout the day, crewmen could be see strolling the city's
streets, often surrounded by female admirers. The carnival
atmosphere lasted into Friday evening.
   Vladimir Zverev, the military commandant of Sevastopol, looked
with amusement at the crowd on the pier. ``We didn't expect so many
people,'' he said. ``This is the biggest reception for a ship I
have ever seen here.''
   But he said the welcome was appropriate ``given the state of our
relations today.''
   Adm. Mikhail N. Khronopulo, head of the Soviet Black Sea fleet,
said Friday he could not have imagined even two years ago he would
be receiving senior U.S. Navy officers in such a friendly
atmosphere.
   But now, he said, the idea that Soviet and U.S. captains might
share a cup of tea as their ships pass ``is difficult to imagine,
but not impossible.''
   The American sailors, too, commented on the strange sensation of
suddenly being treated as such good friends.
   Aviator Matt Zentry of Seattle recalled having been trained to
recognize Soviet ships from afar. ``And now, here were are right
next to them,'' he said.
   The agenda for the American sailors includes a tour of state
farms, a vineyard, an art museum, an aquarium, a war museum and
naval installations. They will be entertained at concerts, eat
meals aboard Soviet ships and play basketball, soccer and
volleyball with their Soviet counterparts.
   Sevastopol, in its strategic position on the Crimean peninsula,
has been the target of many invasions since it was founded on a
Greek colony in 1422 B.C.
   A monument stands in the town harbor to Russian ships that were
intentionally sunk there to block the way for invaders during the
Crimean War in the mid-1850s.
   Modern-day Sevastopol, despite its many navy installations,
conveys an atmosphere of seaside ease, with its classical
architecture and many rose bushes.

<HEAD>Former Koch Aide Indicted for Perjury</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with announcement, arraignment,
details. Picks up 7th graf, `The commission....'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A former high-ranking aide to Mayor Edward I.
Koch has been indicted for perjury in testimony regarding political
patronage, officials announced today, less than six weeks before
the mayoral primary election.
   Joseph DeVincenzo, former special assistant to Koch, was accused
of lying to the New York State Commission on Government Integrity
on July 13 and 21 last year and in a public hearing of that
commission this past Jan. 11.
   DeVincenzo, 46, told the commission that politically connected
job applicants were not given favorable treatment, a position
contradicted by other witnesses.
   DeVincenzo appeared in state court today, pleaded innocent and
was released on his own recognizance pending an Aug. 11 hearing.
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky, who announced
today that the 11-count indictment issued up Thursday, noted that
patronage is not illegal. Perjury, however, is punishable by a
maximum of seven years in prison.
   DeVincenzo was responsible for the city's Talent Bank, which
ostensibly recruited minorities to fill city posts. Critics claim
the program actually was a patronage mill, doling out the highest
paying jobs to whites.
   Files relating to the program's operations were destroyed at the
beginning of city corruption scandals. DeVincenzo and others told
the commission that the destruction of those records was routine
and not part of a cover-up.
   The Talent Bank, which operated out of an office in the basement
of City Hall, has become a campaign issue as Koch seeks the
Democratic nomination to run for a fourth term in November.
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, in an telephone interview,
defended the timing of the indictment.
   ``We did consider it,'' Morgenthau said. ``But we could not be
in the role of censor, deciding what the public could and could not
hear.''
   He said that if possible, the charges would have been filed
earlier, but ``we moved as expeditiously as we could.''
   The commission was told that some of the files at the Talent
Bank were marked with color codes, indicating a party leader or
other political sponsor who might have referred an applicant to
DeVincenzo.
   His own assistant, James G. Hein, testified that DeVincenzo had
ordered him in February 1986 to ``cleanse'' the employment computer
and paper files of ``any references to political figures.''
   In February, Koch announced that he had asked for DeVincenzo's
resignation. But DeVinenzo had already filed papers to resign,
ensuring his pension of $52,000 a year.

<HEAD>Defense Minister: MiG-Backed Forces Ready For Viet Pullout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Vietnamese-supported army,
now with advanced Soviet MIG-21 jet fighters, is ready to take on
guerrillas after Vietnam's pullout in September, the Cambodian
defense minister said.
   On the diplomatic front, a U.N. fact-finding mission dispatched
by an international conference in Paris prepared to visit Cambodia
next week before touring the embattled Thai-Cambodian border, a
Thai official said Friday.
   Defense Minister Tie Banh said new military hardware helped make
the military a regular force with infantry, navy and air force
components, according to a report by the official SPK news agency
that was seen in Bangkok on Friday.
   ``Besides the unit of MIG-21, forces of armored cars, tanks and
artillery have also shaped and become ever more effective in
fighting,'' SPK quoted him as saying, without giving any numbers.
   Soviet-backed Vietnam installed the Phnom Penh government after
invading Cambodia in late 1978 and ousting the brutal Khmer Rouge
rulers. The Khmer Rouge, with up to 40,000 fighters the largest of
the three guerrilla forces, poses the greatest threat to the
government.
   The first squadron of MIG-21s piloted by Cambodians landed in
Phnom Penh in June, SPK earlier reported.
   On July 27, Thai Army spokesman Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth
quoted a report that the jets were dispatched from Vietnam's Bien
Hoa airbase to boost the Cambodian army in anticipation of the
pullout.
   Before the jets arrived, the Soviet Union sent tanks, artillery
guns, and ``a vast amount of war materiel'' to Cambodia's Kompong
Som port on June 12, according to the army radio of the Khmer Rouge.
   Western analysts have judged the Cambodian army unimpressive on
the battlefield. The United States says Cambodia's army has about
40,000 troops and is relatively inexperienced, poorly led and prone
to defections to the guerrilla side.
   The United Nations team led by Norwegian Lt. Gen. Martin O.
Vadset is to arrive in Bangkok Sunday and leave for Cambodia's
capital of Phnom Penh Monday, said Kobsak Chutikul of the Foreign
Ministry's Political Department.
   The Paris conference, which opened July 30, is sending the team
to gather information for formation of an international body to
monitor Vietnam's withdrawal.
   Kobsak said the 20 members of the U.N team are from Norway,
India, Canada, Malaysia, Indonesia, France and Australia.
   He said the team will visit Cambodia for a week before spending
Aug. 14-19 studying the situation along the Thai-Cambodia border
and holding talks with Thai Foreign Ministry and military officials.
   Fighting near the border has flared anew in recent weeks. About
280,000 Cambodian refugees live in U.N.-assisted border camps
controlled by the resistance guerrillas.
   The fact-finding mission is to report back to the international
conference before the end of the month.

   Israeli analysts said Friday the apparent
willingness of pro-Iranian kidnappers to suspend threats and start
talking has vindicated Israel's decision to abduct a Shiite Moslem
cleric.
   They say creating movement on the hostage issue is an
achievement, even though there is no guarantee negotiations will
start in earnest or result in freeing either Israeli soldiers or
Western hostages.
   The Israelis have offered to trade Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid for
three of their soldiers held prisoner in Lebanon and the 16 Western
hostages, who include eight Americans. Obeid is a spiritual leader
of Hezbollah, a Shiite group believed responsible for kidnappings
of foreigners.
   ``Israel put the issue of hostages back on the international
agenda,'' said Shlomo Avineri, a former director-general of the
Foreign Ministry.
   Until the current crisis, ``the West accepted people being
captured by bandits and had come to believe nothing could be done
about it,'' he said in an interview.
   Shlomo Gazit, a former chief of military intelligence, said the
abduction was a catalyst for a new willingness by Hezbollah to
trade hostages. Without it, ``nothing would have happened and all
the existing hostages would be in the same hopeless situation as
before,'' he said.
   Gazit said it also ``put the Israeli hostages on the agenda, and
that was the exact purpose.''
   Zeev Schiff, a leading military commentator, was among the few
public critics. Writing in the liberal daily Haaretz on Friday, he
called the abduction a policy of ``restrained lunacy,'' but added
that it might help deter future acts of terror.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin authorized the July 28 abduction
by Israeli commandos after coming under intense pressure to get the
Israeli soldiers home.
   Dore Gold of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies, said there was a special sensitivity in Israel about not
abandoning soldiers in the field.
   Failure to act, he said, ``would have a very deleterious effect
on the morale of the army when it goes into battle. So that leaves
an activist policy as the only choice after efforts to arrange
negotiations failed.''
   ``Sometimes there is a misunderstanding why Israel is not more
aggressive in offering peace,'' he said, adding that the week's
events ``show that the Middle East is a violent region ... and you
have to understand Israel's caution.''
   Obeid's abduction brought criticism from the United States,
especially after the captors of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, a U.S.
Marine kidnapped while on U.N. duty, said Monday they had hanged
him in retaliation. They released a videotape of a man who appeared
to be Higgins on a gallows.
   Some critics said Israel had failed to consider the effect of
its actions on American hostages, even though Israeli officials and
some other reports say Higgins was killed several months ago.
   Such attacks caused concern in Israel, which depends on
Washington for $3 billion a year in economic and military aid, but
Avi Pazner, chief spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
there was no lasting damage.
   ``The attempt by Hezbollah to drive a wedge between Israel and
the United States failed,'' Pazner said. ``All and all, we are
pleased to see our standing in public opinion is very high on this
issue. This is very gratifying.''
   Israel may not be out of the woods, however. Some analysts
believe the final evaluation of Israel's actions will depend on the
results of negotiations.
   Avineri, of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said the action
``will be judged by its outcome. If the outcome is horrible and
hostages are killed, Israel will be condemned. If some or all the
hostages are freed, no one will split hairs about marginal
mistakes.''
   How far Israel will go in meeting Shiite demands for release of
an unspecified number of Palestinians remains a question. About
8,000 Palestinians have been jailed since an uprising against
Israeli occupation began 20 months ago in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Officials are likely to oppose allowing hard-core activists and
convicted killers to return to the occupied lands, which happened
after 1,050 Arabs were traded in May 1985 for three soldiers held
by a radical Palestinian group led by Ahmed Jibril.
   Moshe Nativ, a retired general who helped negotiate that
exchange, said on army radio Obeid was the strongest card for
getting hostages out of Lebanon. In 1985, he noted, there was no
movement in negotiations ``until we kidnapped (Jibril's) nephew.''

   A Washington consulting firm has thrown down
the gauntlet. Atop last week's milk carton, the call of the roll
from the 1964 Republican National Convention and a copy of the
Washington Star, which folded Aug. 7, 1981, turns up an
announcement looking for the messiest desk in Washington.
   The prize, worth $415, is free tuition in the firm's training
course in time management. That is, how to have a tidy desk and,
presumably, tidy habits.
   The offer comes from Priority Management, which trains people in
how to arrange their day, manage their time, keep their files and,
above all else, prioritize.
   Priority Management has no intention of inspecting the nominated
desks to separate the truly disgusting from the merely slovenly. It
will settle for photographic evidence, says Cynthia M. Rozzo,
director of marketing and the brains behind the contest.
   True to form, this is what she has to say, unprompted:
   ``A cluttered desk is a cluttered mind.''
   The contest entries, says Ms. Rozzo, on whose desk there is a
place for everything and everything is in its place, will be
scrutinized for these symptoms:
   _Multiple calendars. (They lead to overbooking, says Ms. Rozzo.)
   _Those little pink phone messages, scattered around. (One may
return yesterday's call more than once.)
   _Reminders on scraps of paper, strewn about. (Tch, tch.)
   _Someday files (as in ``someday I'll get around to it'').
   _Leaning towers in the ``in'' box.
   _Open files atop the desk.
   ``Open files distract from the task at hand,'' Ms. Rozzo said,
yielding to an impulse to instruct.
   ``Let's say you have four projects going on at the same time.
People usually have files from all four on their desks. We show
people they shouldn't do that. We say put three of the files on
some other piece of office furniture. We love credenzas. People who
make credenzas love us.''
   Ms. Rozzo said her firm teaches people how to organize their
day, how to say ``No, I can't talk to you,'' how to delegate and
how to keep a boss or colleague from laying on an unscheduled chore
by asking, ``Is it urgent and important? Can it wait?''
   Instead of saying, ``I'll get back to you,'' says Ms. Rozzo,
``you should say, `I will call you on Aug. 9.'''
   One should not say, ``I will call you on Aug. 9 if I can find my
telephone under this pile of stuff.'' That is very untidy. It will
not do.

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Warns Against Infighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The underground leadership of the Palestinian
uprising Friday denounced groups that have threatened Arab
nationalists, claiming the infighting is inspired by Israel.
   ``Nationalists have been accused of collaboration and their cars
have been burned in the name of the uprising,'' said a leaflet
signed by the Unified Leadership Strike Forces and circulated in
the West Bank.
   It urged Palestinians to ``declare war'' on those issuing false
leaflets, which it said were ``inspired by suspicious elements
working in the enemy's (Israel's) intelligence.''
   The statement comes amid a growing trend of violence, threats
and factional rivalry within the Arab community in the 20-month-old
uprising.
   At least 87 Palestinian deaths have been blamed on other Arabs
since the revolt against Israeli rule began in December 1987. Army
gunfire and Israeli settlers have killed 527 Palestinians.
Thirty-eight Israelis also have died.
   The army said Friday it is investigating the stabbing death of
an Arab man whose body was found near Kufr Zibad village, 30 miles
northwest of Jerusalem.
   Israel radio quoted residents as saying the man was suspected of
collaborating with Israel and had been interrogated by uprising
leaders before he was slain.
   The underground leadership's leaflet condemned statements issued
by 10 largely obscure groups, including the Palestinian Popular
Army.
   A statement issued in the name of the Popular Army on July 16
threatened Bir Zeit University Professor Sari Nusseibeh for
allegedly misusing uprising funds and cooperating with Israel.
   Prosecution papers filed in an Israeli case against several
uprising leaders alleged Nusseibeh was paymaster of the uprising.
But the professor, a Palestine Liberation Organization supporter,
never was charged.
   Jamil Tarifi, a West Bank lawyer, was threatened by wall slogans
signed by the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine. The leaflet did not refer to that group, which
participates in the unified leadership.
   Tarifi recently announced that he took part in talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Several Arabs have met with
Shamir to discuss his peace initiative, but Tarifi is the only one
to publicly admit it.
   The initiative calls for elections in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip to select Palestinians to open talks with Israel on
limited autonomy.
   Shamir on Friday again ruled out any dealings with the PLO,
which Israel brands a terrorist organization but many Palestinians
consider their sole legitimate representative.
   ``We will not meet and talk with the PLO,'' Shamir told a
delegation from the United Jewish Appeal. ``They are not partners
to peace. They are the very opposite of peace. Their objective is
to eliminate the Jewish state and replace it with another Arab
state.''
   His comments coincided with the general congress of the PLO's
dominant Fatah faction in Tunisia, where chairman Yasser Arafat is
seeking support for his recent moderate stance and calls for peace
with Israel.

<HEAD>Syrian-Christian Clash in South Beirut Kills 2</HEAD>

   Shells crashed into residential areas of
Beirut on Friday during a five-hour battle that sent civilians
rushing to bomb shelters. Police said two people died and seven
were wounded.
   The clash started as an exchange of sniper fire between the
Christian district of Ein Rummaneh and the adjacent Shiite Moslem
slum of Chiyah. It developed into a duel with howitzers, mortars
and cannons that lasted until midday.
   Each side accused the other of starting the clash.
   Explosions echoed through the narrow alleys of Chiyah, and
people ran for cover as the call to Friday prayers blared from
mosque minarets. Businesses that opened in nearby districts closed.
   ``Now they're shelling Chiyah. It might develop and reach us,''
said Najib Masoud, a grocer in the Zarif neighborhood.
   ``What a life. We are living under the ground like the dead. We
might as well die,'' he murmured as he lowered his shop's shutter
and headed off for a shelter with a bag of canned food and some
bottled water.
   By police count, the 20-week-old confrontation between the
predominantly Christian troops of Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian
troops has killed 516 people and wounded 2,183.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Syrian snipers in Chiyah targeted his soldiers'
positions in Ein Rummaneh.
   ``Our sharpshooters responded to the fire. They (Syrians)
upgraded their fire power and we responded in kind,'' the spokesman
said.
   A spokesman for the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia,
Syria's closest ally and dominant in Chiyah, said Syrian soldiers
``had to open fire at Aoun's army to protect Chiyah's citizens.''
   ``Aoun's soldiers were shooting at everything that moved in
Chiyah early in the morning. The Syrians fired back to silence the
sources of fire,'' said the Amal spokesman, who identified himself
only by the code name Abu Ali.
   He said Amal fighters did not take part in the confrontation.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said the two fatalities occurred in Chiyah.
   Syrian gunners Chiyah opened up with 130mm Soviet-designed
howitzers at the Christian suburb of Kfarshima, southeast of
Beirut, the police spokesman said.
   He said Aoun's gunners responded with 155mm U.S.-made howitzers,
shelling Chiyah and the Druse suburb of Choueifat.
   Aoun's tanks deployed in the suburb of Haszmiyeh, east of
Beirut, also shelled the Shiite slums of Sfeir and Moallem on
Chiyah's southern edge, he added.
   Only 200,000 people of Beirut's original 1.5 million population
remain in the city, the main arena for ferocious shelling duels
since the Christian-Syrian confrontation broke out March 8.
   Most refugees have settled in south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa
valley and the Christian-controlled mountain resorts northeast of
Beirut.
   The confrontation broke out after Aoun blockaded illegal ports
run by Syrian-backed militias to recover lost customs dues.
   The Syrians and allied Moslem and leftist forces retaliated by
shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the
capital.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, escalated the confrontation by
declaring a ``war of liberation'' against the 40,000 Syrian troops
deployed in predominantly Moslem sections of Lebanon.

   The Bush administration expressed optimism
Friday over signs that Iran is pursuing a more moderate course
under its new president but said relations cannot improve unless
Iran helps secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon.
   The reactions came after the Iranian president, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said there are ``reasonable, prudent solutions'' to the
hostage problem.
   Rafsanjani's comments appeared to be the most hopeful indication
of a possible accommodation between the two countries since Islamic
fundamentalists ousted the pro-American monarchy in Iran 10{ years
ago.
   The loss of Iran into the anti-American camp was considered one
of the worst strategic setbacks for the United States since World
War II, given Iran's location and abundant oil reserves.
   For the third day in a row, the State Department on Friday
issued a cautious but upbeat statement citing evidence that Iran
was moving away from its policy of unswerving hostility toward the
United States.
   ``We do not have a full text of President Rafsanjani's remarks
and we are reacting cautiously to the reported excerpts,'' said
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. ``However, based on
the excerpts we have seen, President Rafsanjani's remarks appear to
be moderate and are therefore encouraging.
   ``We have reason to believe that Iran is genuinely engaged and
no reason to believe that its engagement is not focussed in a
positive direction,'' she said.
   But she added that any improvement in relations will be
contingent on Iranian willingness to act ``responsibly in the world
arena to include an effort to resolve the hostage issue once and
for all by producing release of all our hostages and by making it
clear that they have turned away from support of terrorism.''
   For his part, President Bush said he would explore ``to the
fullest'' Rafsanjani's offer of cooperation. But he added, ``I
don't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment.''
   Hours earlier, Rafsanjani had said in his weekly prayer sermon
at Tehran University that Iran will ``help solve the problems'' in
Lebanon.
   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions,
the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent
solutions,'' Rafsanjani said.
   But, like the State Department statement, Rafsanjani attached
conditions to his offer of cooperation.
   He said the United States must take the initiative by pressuring
Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric it
kidnapped from south Lebanon a week ago.
   If the United States responds by saying it cannot do so, ``this
isn't acceptable to us,'' Rafsanjani said.
   Still, Iranian behavior for much of the hostage crisis this week
has been in marked contrast to what the United States was
accustomed to under the rule of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, who died in June.
   The first hint of a new Iranian approach occurred Tuesday, when
Rafsanjani and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze issued a
statement in Tehran expressing regret over the reported killing
Monday of Lt. Col. William Higgins.
   The statement appeared to put Iran at odds with the pro-Iranian
group in Lebanon that claimed to have carried out Higgins'
execution.
   Then, on Thursday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization in
Lebanon indicated in a statement announcing a reprieve in the death
sentence for American hostage Joseph Cicippio that it was bowing to
Iran's wishes.
   In the past, Iran has also linked improved relations to U.S.
release of Iranian assets frozen after the seizure of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in 1979.

   A paraplegic Park Service ranger who used only
his arm strength to climb a 3,200-foot rock face in Yosemite
presented President Bush on Friday with an American flag that he
and his partner carried.
   ``This is great,'' the president told climber Mark Wellman, who
came to the Oval Office in his wheelchair. ``You certainly captured
the imagination of the whole country.''
   Wellman later said the Park Service needs more federal money to
spend on making the national parks accessible to the handicapped.
But he said he did not have time in his brief meeting with Bush to
discuss such issues.
   ``We just need more attention brought to it,'' he told reporters
after the meeting.
   Wellman, a naturalist for the park service and director of
Yosemite's program for the disabled, said he and Bush discussed the
president's love of the outdoors and fishing.
   The 29-year-old climber, dressed in his park ranger uniform, and
his fellow climber, Mike Corbett, gave Bush an American flag that
was in the gear they cut loose before they reached the summit of El
Capitan on their climb of seven days and four hours.
   Also attending the meeting were Park Service Director Jim
Ridenour and Jack Moorehead, associate director of operations for
the Park Service.
   Wellman and Corbett completed the climb on July 26.
   Wellman hauled himself, six inches at a time, to the top of the
cliff, one of Yosemite's most well-known landmarks.
   Their climb captured widespread media attention, including a
news conference attended by some 55 reporters and rangers when they
reached the summit.
   Wellman, whose legs were paralyzed in a 1982 fall from another
Yosemite peak, was the first paraplegic to make the vertical trek,
doing 7,000 pullups on ropes placed by Corbett.
   Wellman chose a route that was almost straight up because it was
more practical for him.
   The route included tackling the Shield Roof, a ledge jutting 40
feet out from the monolith at 2,000 feet above Yosemite Valley.
Wellman and Corbett had to dangle beneath it and hoist themselves
up a rope with the valley floor far below them.

   A plea bargain involving one misdemeanor
charge each against the captain and owner of the tanker that
spilled 300,000 gallons of oil off Newport awaits only a judge's
approval, a prosecutor said Friday.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond would not identify the charge or
the penalties that the government will recommend, but said the
charge carries a potential jail term and fines totaling twice the
cleanup costs.
   The captain of the Greek tanker World Prodigy, Iakovos
Georgudis, was charged last month with misdemeanor violations of
federal anti-pollution laws that carry up to a year in jail and
fines of twice the cleanup costs. The owner, Ballard Shipping Co.,
has not been charged.
   The tanker struck Brenton Reef, near the mouth of Narragansett
Bay, on June 23 and ruptured its hull. Most of the heating oil was
quickly cleaned up or dissipated, but the spill killed dozens of
young lobsters and crabs.
   Most beaches that were affected by the spill reopened within a
week, but one in Jamestown remains closed indefinitely because oil
has soaked into the sand.
   Georgudis has admitted he erred by not waiting for a harbor
pilot familiar with the area.
   Almond and defense attorneys met for about 40 minutes with U.S.
District Judge Ernest C. Torres and said later they were waiting
for the judge to set a court date to confirm the agreement. Almond
said it could be as early as next week.
   Georgudis, free on $50,000 bail, did not attend the closed-door
hearing. His attorney, John A. MacFadyen, declined to comment on
the case or say where his client was.
   ``He's being hounded terribly _ people pounding on his hotel
room door at four in the morning,'' MacFadyen said.
   Almond said the cleanup costs on which the fine would be based
had not yet been calculated, but added: ``You can rest assured they
would be substantial, in excess of a million dollars.''
   Georgudis was indicted last month on state felony charges of
polluting coastal waters and failing to have a harbor pilot on
board. He has not yet been arraigned on those charges.

   Rescuers crawled on their hands and knees
up a mountain slope Friday to recover bodies and the flight
recorder of an Olympic Airlines plane that slammed into the highest
peak in the Aegean, killing 34 people.
   The twin-engine plane, circling in thick fog Thursday, hit
4,785-feet Mount Kerkis in the Kournies region of this eastern
Aegean island off Turkey's southwest coast.
   The rescuers found remains of bodies and the aft section of the
30-seat British-built aircraft on an inaccessible slope of the
mountain at 3,960 feet. The plane was split in half with debris
scattered over a wide area.
   The front part of the plane had disintegrated when it hit the
mountain, leaving only a black scar on the steep slope.
   Searchers said they found the flight recorder in the aft section
of the aircraft, one of the few parts left intact.
   ``It appears that thick fog in the area at the time played the
villain's role as the pilot flew blindly into the mountainside,''
said an airline official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He
added that pilots fly ``visually'' on flights to small Aegean
islands that Olympic services.
   The rescuers approached the crash site early Friday, crawling on
their hands and knees for 90 minutes up a steep slope in darkness.
   ``Unfortunately, we could do nothing,'' said Emmanuel Karlas, a
doctor from a nearby village.``I checked every body I could find.''
   No immediate attempts were made to remove the bodies because of
the inaccessible terrain, but managed to ferry out at least nine
bodies later in the day.
   Officials did not say how many bodies were recovered.
   It was the first air crash for Olympic in 13 years. Officials
said the propeller-driven plane had not experienced any serious
problems since it went into service in 1981.
   There were 34 people aboard, including an infant, airline
officials said.
   Officials said pilot Petros Moutzoureas was an hour into his
domestic flight from Salonica in northern Greece when he radioed
his final position as he made his approach for landing.
   The plane disappeared from Athens and Salonica radar screens
when it was about 25 miles off the island's northwest coast. When
it failed to land at 5:30 p.m., officials ordered and air and sea
search.
   Transport and Communications Minister Nikos Gelestathis said all
the victims were Greeks, although Yannis Orphanides, a Canadian of
Greek descent, said in Salonica that his parents, brother, wife and
infant son _ all Canadians from Toronto _ were killed.
   The Canadian Embassy in Athens said three other passengers who
had booked their tickets in Toronto also could have been Canadian
citizens. An embassy official said they were checking with their
foreign office in Ottawa to confirm their nationality.

   For those with nothing better to do on Sunday
than dog Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' footsteps, an entrepreneur has
made it easy: a $10 walking tour past the former first lady's
apartment house, supermarket, florist and drugstore.
   ``The chances are really slim,'' tour leader Sam Stafford
admits, of seeing much more than an apartment house, a supermarket
or the usual drugstore facade since Mrs. Onassis usually spends
weekends on Martha's Vineyard and also is ``laying low since the
book came out.''
   The recent publication of ``A Woman Named Jackie'' and her 60th
birthday on July 28 prompted Stafford, founder of Sidewalks of New
York, to come up with the tour. Also included are churches where

   Burt Reynolds has given his Jupiter Theatre
to a community college, but the actor's not giving up the stage
without a final bow.
   Saturday night's farewell performance will include appearances
by Reynolds and his wife, actress Loni Anderson, and ``some
surprises,'' but no one's saying what those surprises will be.
   ``This is our night, our last fling, and we'd like to do it our
way,'' said BRJT producer K.R. Williams. Reynolds has had the
theater for more than 10 years.
   When the transfer of the theater to Palm Beach Community College
was announced earlier this year, Reynolds declined to comment, but
earlier he had said it lost $1.5 million in 1987 and 1988.
   Saturday night's benefit performance of ``A Funny Thing Happened
On The Way To The Forum,'' at $100 a ticket, is sold out.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez is expected to attend.

   A Texas woman says her daughter, who
she said is dating the nephew of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, is
returning home to escape the nagging British press.
   Pat Horton of Houston says her 24-year-old daughter, Laura
Horton, has been hounded by British royalty watchers since she
began dating Princess Margaret's 27-year-old son, David, the
Viscount Linley.
   ``I told Laura that being royal was kind of like having a
handicap because you don't have much privacy,'' Mrs. Horton told
the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``Laura says they can't really do
anything because of all of the publicity.''
   Mrs. Horton said her daughter plans to fly back to Texas soon to
take a break. The daughter is a 1986 Texas Christian University
graduate with a degree in music, who is a model and singer in
London.

   Country music singer Wynonna Judd has
denied a story published in a tabloid saying she is pregnant.
   The 25-year-old performer, who is not married, said in a
statement released Wednesday by her office that she had a pregnancy
test after the story appeared in the Aug. 8 edition of The Globe.
   ``The Globe story represents another clear and convincing case
of irresponsible journalism practiced by some publications that
have unfortunately become prevalent in our society,'' the statement
said.
   ``It is unfortunate that the victim of malicious and false
rumors has to prove her innocence with irrefutable evidence to
combat the dissemination of false information,'' she said.
   Wynonna is the daughter of the mother-daughter duo seen in TV
commercials and is known for hit records such as ``Grandpa'' and

   Pro football Hall of Famer Roger Staubach has
made an appeal to President Bush to help out some of his pilot
friends at Eastern Airlines, which has been on strike for five
months and is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
   The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback asked in a letter dated
Aug. 1 that a meeting be set up between representatives of the
Eastern pilots union and Roger Porter, Bush's domestic policy
adviser.
   Staubach said the striking pilots include the best man at his
wedding, football teammates and classmates at the U.S. Naval
Academy, where Staubach also was a quarterback.
   From his conversations with those friends and from ``all other
accounts,'' Staubach wrote, ``it is obvious that the Eastern
situation is far more than a traditional labor-management dispute.
It goes to the very root of the free enterprise system within our
country.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said he had no comment
on Staubach's letter or speculation that the former football
player, who now runs a real estate company in Dallas, might get
involved in making a buyout offer for the company.

<DATELINE>CENTRAL FALLS, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rhode Island's smallest and poorest
city, eager to relieve its financial crisis and downtrodden image,
is staking its future on something nobody else wanted _ a trash
incinerator.
   Other Rhode Island communities have fought expensive legal
battles against landfills and incinerators, but Mayor Carlos A.
Silva Jr. offered Central Falls as a site for a state disposal
plant in hopes of raising from $750,000 to $1.5 million a year in
revenue from the state waste agency. The exact amount of revenue to
be paid is under negotiation.
   Residents who voted for the incinerator in a July 25 referendum
said they accepted Silva's argument that it was the city's only
available source of new cash, even though the plant faces a barrage
of environmental hearings and cannot open for at least three years.
   ``Nobody wants us. Everybody's trying to put us down and here's
this man (the mayor) trying to boost us up by saying, `Let's have
the incinerator,''' said Anne Marie Healey, who voted in favor. ``I
think we have to trust him.''
   The incinerator, one of three waste-to-energy plants the state's
Solid Waste Management Corp. is required to build, already has been
rejected on environmental grounds by Woonsocket and North
Smithfield. Another plant, in North Kingstown, has been tied up in
legal battles for 1{ years by residents and town officials who fear
the pollution it could cause.
   Opponents of the Central Falls plant raised similar concerns,
saying the state's smallest, most densely populated city, with an
estimated 17,556 residents packed into 1.2 square miles, was no
place for a trash incinerator.
   Some residents fear the 1,447-to-1,274 vote in favor of the
plant means critics of the town will have a new reason to look down
on it.
   ``I work with a lot of people from neighboring communities and
they say, `Burn the city.' They think it's all druggies,'' said a
35-year-old nurse who voted against the incinerator.
   Officials in the neighboring communities of Cumberland, Lincoln
and Pawtucket are threatening to do what they can to block the
project, but the threats have added to the fighting spirit among
those who remember the slights their city received from its
neighbors over the years.
   ``I think it's good to put it on the Pawtucket line because they
didn't regionalize the schools, and on the Lincoln line because
they wouldn't rent us their school,'' said the nurse. ``All the
garbage trucks are going to go through their towns. I'm glad about
that.''
   The nurse, like some other residents, would discuss the volatile
issue only anonymously for fear of antagonizing her neighbors.
   Central Falls has a large population of poor Latin American
immigrants crammed into decaying three-decker tenements and a 1980
median annual family income of $14,721, lowest in the state and far
below the statewide median of $19,448 in 1980.
   The median home price, $100,000, is the lowest anywhere in Rhode
Island except for the slums of Providence.
   The city raised taxes 18 percent recently trying to cope with
potential deficits of $1.1 million this year and $400,000 next year
caused by a stagnant tax base, federal revenue sharing cuts and a
$1.5 million settlement with a man who claimed he was paralyzed by
police brutality in the city jail.
   It was against that background that city leaders began
campaigning to get the incinerator, saying that with virtually no
open land left to develop, the city has no other way to boost its
tax base.
   ``The dollars this facility is talking about would take
something like 750 new homes to bring in,'' said state Rep. Robert
R. Brousseau. ``That's physically impossible.''
   Opponents placed fliers throughout the city warning: ``Anyone
who is living in Central Falls above the fourth floor will be even
with the incinerator smokestack. You may have to keep your windows
closed on nice days, depending on the direction of the wind.''
   Those arguments, apparently aimed at residents of high-rise
senior-citizen housing, did not impress elderly residents who
remember when the incinerator site was used as a city dump and
sewage filtration pond.
   ``Nobody died. Nobody got sick,'' said a 67-year-old man. ``They
used to play baseball down there.''
   Healey, whose back yard is within view of the incinerator site,
said she was also comforted by the track record of a nearby
crematorium. ``You can't smell a thing,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says U.S. Bases Vital to Development</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American military bases in the
Philippines play a vital role in regional stability and should be
maintained despite favorable changes in the Soviet political
climate, the U.S. ambassador said Friday.
   Ambassador Nicholas Platt told a seminar at the University of
the Philippines that economic development in the Philippines and
elsewhere in Asia ``cannot happen without security.''
   ``There is a regional consensus that the U.S. security umbrella
is as important now, even in this changing era, as it was before,''
Platt said.
   ``If we are to have a successful new partnership, we will need
continuing American involvement in the security of this region,''
Platt said. ``Our military facilities here in the Philippines are
one element of the security equation.''
   The United States and the Philippines are expected to begin
preliminary talks this year on whether to extend the lease on the
six American installations, which expires in 1991.
   After 1991, any extension must be approved by two-thirds of the
23-member Philippine Senate.
   Opposition to the bases has been growing here. Several leading
politicians have called for the bases to be closed in 1991 or
phased out over a 10-year period.
   President Corazon Aquino has refused to say whether she will
support an extension.
   Platt said the economy of the Philippines depends on trade and
the bases play a vital role in protecting sea lanes.
   ``There is a balance between the United States, the Soviet
Union, Japan and China,'' Platt said. ``And the maintenance of that
balance creates the stability that everybody is trying to preserve.
The maintenance of that stability provides the background for the
progress, the economic progress, that everybody wants.''
   Platt noted that the Soviet Union is undergoing political
changes that ``are welcome to us.
   ``But we don't think it is smart, and we don't think it makes
sense, to dismantle the alliance relationships that we have while
we are assessing what these changes are.''
   In a related development, Filipino diplomats said a U.S.
congressional delegation will visit the Philippines to look into
the possibility of withdrawing some troops in the next few years.
   About 40,000 U.S. troops, civilian employees and military
dependents are stationed in the Philippines.
   The diplomats said Reps. Patricia Schroeder, John Murtha, and
Dante Fascell will arrive Aug. 11.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday hailed the
inaugural session of the revamped Soviet legislature as a
successful exercise in democracy that produced important laws and
heralded the beginning of genuine oversight of government.
   ``The Supreme Soviet has become not a parade but a working
legislative body,'' the president told lawmakers gathered in the
Kremlin for the final day of the session.
   The Supreme Soviet once was dominated by Communist cogs who
approved government proposals with no criticism. But under
Gorbachev's political reforms, the body was revamped into a
full-time legislature with new powers of generating legislation and
reviewing candidates for top government jobs.
   During the session that started June 26, the Supreme Soviet
rejected several Cabinet nominees and approved legislation to
increase pensions and grant a measure of economic independence to
the Baltic republics.
   In earlier speeches, Gorbachev called the Supreme Soviet and its
larger parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, a ``school of
democracy.'' But he said Friday of the recent session: ``By its
intensity, it was a whole university.''
   Criticism came from Deputy Igor N. Gryazin, a constitutional law
professor from Estonia, who said the session was flawed by 20 major
constitutional violations.
   He said one violation occurred Friday when it reversed an
earlier rejection of Nikolai S. Konarev for railway minister.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who had nominated Konarev as well as
half a dozen other Cabinet candidates rejected by the Supreme
Soviet, told reporters he did not mind the oversight. He called it
``a big step forward in democratization and in the formation of a
completely new system of government.''
   Gorbachev said in his 40-minute address that the new legislature
met during a stormy period, with ``not one quiet day'' as ethnic
violence flared in several republics and hundreds of thousands of
coal miners walked off their jobs.
   He pressed the legislature to approve a resolution strengthening
the fight against a burgeoning crime rate.
   Later, legislators passed the resolution that will increase the
number of Interior Ministry soldiers ``in case of mass disobedience
by criminal elements.'' It is the Interior Ministry soldiers that
have restored order when ethnic violence has broken out in several
Soviet republics.
   Local ad hoc groups of police, prosecutors, and court officials
will organize the anti-crime effort, and Vice President Anatoly I.
Lukyanov will oversee it.
   Ryzhkov told reporters government ministers had canceled their
summer holidays which traditionally begin in August to work on
implementing the new legislation.
   Gorbachev said the next session of the Supreme Soviet, which he
said is scheduled to start Sept. 25, should adopt laws on property,
leasing, taxation and strikes.
   Showing his political skill, Gorbachev deflated demands that
constitutional changes be made before local elections are held. The
Inter-Regional Deputies group, whose leaders include Communist
maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, had wanted the Congress of People's
Deputies to meet soon to adopt changes that would ensure local
elections would be completely democratic.
   Gorbachev, in a proposal Yeltsin welcomed, suggested the changes
be informally approved by deputies in a poll and that local
authorities be guided by them in holding the elections. The
Congress would then meet in a scheduled session in December,
deputies said.

   Two education leaders said Friday it will take
money as well as leadership to turn President Bush into the
education president he has said he wants to be.
   ``As long as there is a budget deadlock and the administration
has its hands tied by its own budget policies, it's going to be
very difficult for Bush to be the education president,'' said
Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, an
umbrella group for all U.S. colleges and universities.
   Atwell and Dick Rosser, president of the 830-member National
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, said they
hope Bush's education summit next month with the nation's governors
will include higher education as well as the elementary and
secondary grades.
   ``There are very serious problems'' in higher education, Rosser
said, among them ``an incredible need for science facilities'' and
more federal money for research support and student aid.
   ``It cannot be simply leadership at the national level. It's got
to be money,'' he said.
   Atwell and Rosser said higher education did not fare as well as
the lower grades in the House appropriations bill for fiscal 1990
that passed earlier this week.
   ``The House appropriations overall are really quite insufficient
and could do great damage to students,'' Atwell said. ``We're going
to be working very hard to do better in the Senate in higher
education than we did in the House.''
   Atwell and Rosser also pledged to continue fighting for a
separate aid program for students at for-profit schools, which have
a loan default rate four times as high as the 9 percent average for
four-year institutions.
   The House committee said it was concerned about sky-high default
rates at some trade schools and said there would be ``a full
review'' of defaults and other problems in the financial aid
program next year when the Higher Education Act comes up for
reapproval.
   The for-profit schools are attracting an ever-greater proportion
of grants and loans, some of them for classes of dubious value or
students with dubious ability, educators say.
   The shift prompted Atwell's controversial call for a separate
aid program and has also resulted in colleges and universities
devoting more of their own resources to campus-based student aid.
   Rosser said school-sponsored aid rose from $900 million in 1979
to $3.5 billion in the past year at the private, non-profit schools
he represents.
   Rosser said faculty salaries still don't match the purchasing
power they had in 1972 while ``staff salaries are much lower and
probably in much worse shape.''
   In addition, he said, schools are spending money on science
equipment that can't wait and a whole array of new services
designed to meet student needs and help schools stay competitive _
career placement departments, security forces, drug and alcohol
abuse programs, and counselors to help minority students and others
with special needs.

<TEXT>
   West Berlin's left-leaning government
said Friday it wants to improve the environment by reducing flights
in and out of the city, but federal authorities say that could
increase West Berliners' isolation.
   West Berlin's government, headed by the Social Democrats in a
coalition with the environmentalist Alternative List, proposes that
36 daily flights be eliminated from Tegel Airport's schedule,
spokesman Werner Kolhoff said Friday.
   Kolhoff told the radio station Sender Freies Berlin that the
plan, which would cut commercial air traffic by about 15 percent,
is aimed at cutting down on noise and exhaust emissions from
jetliners servicing West Berlin.
   Horst Wagner, West Berlin's transportation minister, says that
while the number of commercial flights increased 23.6 percent in
1988 from the previous year, the number of passengers increased
only 6.2 percent in the same period.
   Die Welt, the conservative daily, said ``low-load'' flights
would be affected by the reduction, meaning flights that do not
normally carry many passengers.
   The United States, Britain and France formally administer West
Berlin under post-World War II agreements and would have to approve
the proposal. The federal government also must be consulted.
   The three Allied air attaches probably will meet with West
Berlin and federal officials next week to discuss the matter, said
an Allied official in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Herbert Schmuelling, a federal government spokesman, said the
cut in flights could run counter to the Berlin Initiative of former
President Ronald Reagan, who while he was in office called for
improved access to the divided city.
   Schmuelling said air traffic ``is the only uncontrolled access
to the city'' and that a major reduction of flights would have a
``pyschological'' effect on residents of the Western enclave
surrounded by East Germany.
   Eduard Lintner, a federal lawmaker with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union, said the proposal sends a ``dangerous
signal'' and would be a serious setback for the city.
   Rudolf Kraus, a leading official with the Christian Social
Union, Kohl's Bavarian sister party, said the plan ``bears the
clear signature of the alternatives (Alternative List), who want to
turn Berlin into an island uncoupled from the Federal Republic.''
   Allied civil air officials based in Bonn said the Allied civil
air attaches ``must weigh the needs of the traveling public and the
Berlin population as well as commercial and practical aviation
considerations.
   ``The Allies intend to ensure that the high quality of aviation
services in Berlin will be maintained and that measures to protect
the Berlin environment will be implemented as appropriate,'' the
officials said.
   People can also reach West Berlin by vehicle and by train, which
must pass through East German border control points.
   Officials say about 7,000 flights in and out of West Berlin are
scheduled every month, averaging about 220 a day. Flights in June
had about 400,000 passengers.

   Rick Sargent didn't expect to see his
wallet or his credit cards again after they fell into Lake Geneva
during a recent trip to Switzerland, but a Swiss diver retrieved
them and mailed them home.
   ``I think if someone lost their wallet in Lake Lanier, somebody
would probably take the money and just throw the wallet away,''
said Sargent, band leader at Chamblee High School.
   He was in Switzerland with the DeKalb College Jazz Band for the
international Montreux Jazz Festival when his wallet, containing
$169 and credit cards, slipped out of his pocket and into the lake.
   He returned to Lawrenceville July 22 and last week received his
wallet and its contents in the mail with a letter from Georges
Delacombaz of the Montreux Scuba Diving Club, who found them. The
letter said the diver plans to visit the United States and
suggested ``maybe we could meet somewhere for a beer.''
   ``I was really amazed that, number one, somebody found my
wallet, and that, number two, they'd go to that much trouble to
return it,'' said Sargent.
   Sargent said he will write Delacombaz and include a reward.

   A bank dedicated to young customers is offering
what it says is the first-ever credit card for children.
   Young Americans Bank introduced the new credit cards Thursday at
a party marking the institution's second anniversary.
   Like most credit cards, these have restrictions. Children must
talk a parent or other adult into co-signing and guaranteeing
payment on their accounts.
   Although cardholders must be at least 12 years old and cannot
exceed a $100 credit limit, the bank will consider increasing
credit limits and lowering age requirements for particularly
creditworthy children, said Leanne Cadman, who heads the bank's
loan department.
   Otherwise, the MasterCards, issued by United Bank of Denver, are
just like the grown-up versions. Kids will receive a monthly
statement advising them of the balance and telling them the minimum
monthly payment. Interest will accrue at the annual rate of 18.8
percent, Cadman said.
   Young Americans Bank, a state-chartered and federally insured
bank, already offers checking accounts for children 12 or older. In
its two years of service, it has signed up 10,000 depositors.

   What to call a merger of Baltimore and
Washington for statistical purposes:
   _ Washimore? Could be confused with that monument in South
Dakota.
   _ Baltiwash? Sounds like a new laundry detergent.
   _ Balington? Washbal? These and other names are facetiously
being considered if the U.S. Census Bureau decides after the 1990
census that the two cities' populations have grown close enough to
combine into one statistical entity.
   ``It doesn't really change anything,'' Don Starsinic, chief of
the population estimate office in the Census Bureau, said Friday.
``It creates one large metropolitan area rather than two fairly
large metropolitan areas.''
   He added that the government could still provide statistics
tailored to each population center if local officials desired.
   The Washington area has more than 3.7 million people and the
Baltimore area has 2.3 million people, ranking the two cities ninth
and 17th, respectively, in the nation.
   If combined, they would become the nation's fifth-largest
metropolitan area, Starsinic said.
   Census officials said two areas are combined when the areas
expand so far as to meet each other, with at least 10 percent of
the smaller city's workforce crossing the border each day to work.

with $10 million in food aid, the first such assistance since the
failed elections of November 1987, it was announced Friday.
   Under terms of an agreement signed Thursday in Port-au-Prince,
Haiti will receive about 45,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, which it
will sell on the local market. Proceeds will be used for
development projects.
   In making the announcement, which was first reported Thursday on
Haitian television, the Agency for International Development said
Congress approved the new aid in recognition of continuing progress
by the interim government of Gen. Prosper Avril toward free
elections.
   The decision also was based on Haiti's cooperation with the
United States in narcotics interdiction efforts, AID said.
   The Haitian government cancelled the November 1987 national
elections after an outburst of violence on the morning of the
balloting claimed at least 50 dead and dozens wounded.
   The Reagan administration suspended $62 million in economic aid
hours after Haiti disbanded the national electoral council.
   The only assistance provided since then has been for an
anti-narcotics program and for emergency aid following Hurricane
Gilbert last year.
   Humanitarian aid to the Haitian people through non-governmental
organizations has continued.

   President Bush has invited the prime ministers
of Canada and Denmark, along with their families, to spend time
with him during his upcoming three-week vacation in Maine, the
White House said Friday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Danish Prime
Minister Poul Schulter and his wife would visit Bush's oceanside
family complex in Kennebunkport on Aug. 24-25.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his family will visit
the Bushes on Aug. 30-31, Fitzwater said.
   The president has also extended his August vacation by three
days, the spokesman said.
   Instead of beginning his Maine vacation Aug. 18, he will begin
it Aug. 16. He will remain there through Sept. 5, not Sept. 4 as
originally scheduled, Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Rocket Barrage Hits Kabul, Kills 1</HEAD>

   A barrage of rockets hit Kabul on
Friday, killing one person, injuring eight people and ending a
three-day lull in attacks on the Afghan capital, the government
said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said nine rockets
pounded the capital and most fell on the Duralaman district, where
the Defense Ministry has its headquarters, and the nearby
residential area of Cart-i-Se. He gave a casualty toll of one
killed and eight injured.
   The Afghan news agency Bakhtar said 19 rockets fell on the city,
killing one civilian and injuring four others.
   Amani said later he could not find out whether the figure of 19
was correct because government offices are closed on Friday.
   Officials at Avicina emergency hospital said one rocket hit the
mountain below the the Afghan TV broadcasting tower and one fell in
Cart-i-Char district near Kabul University.
   The Red Cross hospital said five injured persons were brought
there from Cart-i-Se and Cart-i-Char districts.
   This city of 2.25 million people had been subjected to almost
daily rocketing until earlier this week. Between June 25 and Aug.
1, U.N. sources said 281 people were killed and 745 injured in
rocket attacks and a car bombing. Nearly all victims were civilians.
   Afghan security forces launched a major search operation in and
around the capital Monday night and no rockets fell on Kabul until
Friday.
   During the operation, Amani said, security forces confiscated
100 Egyptian-made and Chinese-made rockets.
   Bakhtar quoted a security source as saying that from Tuesday to
Thursday, the air force flew 380 missions over areas where they
suspected there were enemy batteries.
   Supported by artillery and rockets, the air force carried out
attacks on the Paghman Valley, 15 miles west of Kabul, and in a
15-mile area east and southeast of the capital, Bakhtar reported
Thursday.
   It quoted the security source as saying the government plans to
expand the security belt around Kabul to prevent rocket attacks.
   Most rockets used against Kabul have a range of less than 20
miles, though longer range rockets also have been launched.
   No group has claimed responsibility for the recent attacks
against Kabul, though U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to oust
President Najib's Soviet-backed government have said they were
responsible for previous rocketing.
   The guerrillas say they aim at military targets and blame the
government for attacks on schools, markets, bus stops and other
civilian targets _ an allegation vehemently denied by the
government.

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement
Friday affirmed its support for the declaration of a Palestinian
state and the recognition of Israel's right to exist, the
Palestinian news agency reported.
   The declarations were contained in a program adopted in November
by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament in exile. A
third element, renunciation of terrorism, also was supported by
Fatah, the news agency Wafa said.
   About 1,000 delegates to the General Congress of Fatah, the main
component of the Palestine Liberation Organization, are meeting
behind closed doors in Tunis, where the PLO has its headquarters.
   At the congress, Arafat had been expected to come under fire
from Fatah members who opposed concessions to Israel, but the Wafa
dispatch suggested he was able to beat back the challenge.
   The second day of the congress was characterized by ``a frank
and animated discussion concerning internal and political problems,
which shows that the Fatah movement has restored its unity and
solidarity,'' Wafa said.
   The congress opened Thursday and was expected to last about five
days.
   Wafa said participants called for support for the intefadeh, or
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied
territories. The delegates accused Israel of ``a policy of the iron
fist against the Palestinian people in order to neutralize the
intefadeh.''
   Fatah spokesman Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said the congress decided not
to admit any non-Palestinian reporters, and foreign reporters were
not allowed in the vicinity of the Tunis congress hall where the
meeting was held.
   Several Palestinian reporters were allowed into the meeting but
remained silent about the proceedings.
   The Tunisian news agency said only 980 of the 1,059 congress
delegates were in Tunis on Friday but that others were arriving
from many parts of the world.
   The congress set up its group of officers and divided into
committees for discussion of its main topics.
   The essential point on the agenda was the nomination of 10
central committee members. Since the last Fatah congress in 1980,
five members have either been assassinated or joined more militant
PLO factions, and five new seats have been added to the central
committee.

   Two trains collided in Colon, Cuba, on

   The agency, monitored in Mexico City, said the collision
occurred about 4 a.m. in Colon, about 60 miles east of Havana, and
that many of the injured were reported seriously hurt.
   ``People trapped inside the cars are receiving attention from

   The Mexican government news agency Notimex reported from Havana
that both locomotives were destroyed when the trains collided at
high speed. It said one train was bound from Havana to Sancti
Spiritus and the other from Camaguey to Havana.
   A search for victims continued, Notimex said.

<HEAD>Appeal Filed In Age Discrimination Case Involving Vermont Jurist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the state of Vermont said
Friday that they are appealing a federal judge's ruling that a
70-year-old state Supreme Court justice cannot be forced to retire
because of his age.
   Lawyers for the state of Vermont on Friday filed a notice in
U.S. District Court in Rutland that the case was being appealed to
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York.
   At issue is whether a federal law prohibiting age discrimination
applies to appointed state judges. U.S. District Judge Lee
Gagliardi ruled last month that it does and struck down a state
order that Justice Louis Peck retire.
   His ruling, in effect, nullified a section of the Vermont
Constitution that requires all judges to retire at age 70. Peck
turned 70 last December, but refused to retire and filed suit when
the state ordered that he do so.
   Lawyer William Gray, representing the state, said he filed a
notice in U.S. District Court in Rutland that the state was
appealing to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
   ``The decision by the district court is inconsistent with other
rulings on the question and we feel it appropriate that the issue
be addressed by the 2nd Circuit,'' he said.
   Even though Peck won in the first round, he said he welcomed the
appeal. ``I think it is fair to say that both sides want this to go
as high as it can,'' said the justice, one of five on Vermont's
only appeals court.
   ``The higher it goes, the greater an impact it will have,'' Peck
said. ``What we really hope is that the U.S. Supreme Court will
agree to hear this so that we can finally settle the question once
and for all.''
   Gagliardi's ruling within the territory covered by the 2nd
Circuit conflicts with rulings by a federal judge in Massachusetts
and the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the federal
law prohibiting discrimination does not apply to appointed state
judges.
   ``We believe that the confusion coming out of these cases may
make it more attractive for the (U.S. Supreme) court to agree to
hear this,'' said Peck.
   The disagreement is whether the federal Age Discrimination in
Employment Act supersedes state mandatory retirement provisions for
judges. The law prohibits age discrimination, but excludes certain
groups from the provision.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which represents
Peck, argues that judges don't fall under any of the exceptions.
   Gray argues that judges fall under the exception granted for
policymakers, and that the Constitution requires Congress to state
its intention clearly when it wants to regulate qualifications for
such important state offices as judges.
   ``I expect our brief will address both the interpretation of the
statute and the constitutional implications,'' Gray said.
   If the ruling stands under appeal, Peck can remain on the
Supreme Court until his term expires in three years. He could also
seek another six-year term.

   Anti-apartheid church leaders
said Friday they will play a leading role in a mass defiance
campaign that is likely to intensify in the days leading up to
segregated elections Sept. 6.
   ``The defiance campaign expresses the will of the majority of
our population whilst the elections will reflect the concerns of a
very small proportion of South Africans,'' the Rev. Allan Boesak
said on behalf of the South African Council of Churches.
   South Africa's tricameral Parliament has separate houses for the
5 million whites, 3 million people of mixed race and a million
Asians, but excludes the 28 million-member black majority.
   Protests began Wednesday when 270 blacks and Indians sought and
received treatment at segregated white hospitals. There were no
incidents despite government warnings the campaign will lead to
violence.
   The Council of Churches, which includes almost all leading
Protestant denominations, said future protests ``will be initiated
by the church, others will be supported by the church.''
   Churchmen said the new protests will be launched later this
month but declined details.
   Its supporters hope the defiance campaign will be the largest
civil disobedience action in South Africa since the 1950s. It has
been organized by the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose coalition
replacing the United Democratic Front, which was the country's
largest anti-apartheid federation when it was banned last year.
   Police made no attempt to confront protesters on Wednesday.
Authorities have not said how they will respond in the future,
though Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said such activities
``are a time-bomb that could explode at any moment.''
   Election campaigns in recent years have been marked by numerous
bombings and there have been several attacks in the past two weeks
in Johannesburg and Cape Town. The only fatality has been a man
planting a bomb that exploded on a Johannesburg railroad line.
Several other people have been wounded.
   No one has claimed responsibility, but police blame the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement, which has called for
a boycott of the mixed-race and Asian elections.
   Also Friday, the church leaders condemned 16 British cricket
players who have agreed to tour South Africa in 1990 and 1991.
   ``I think it is an obscenity for them to come to South Africa at
this stage of our crisis,'' said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   White South African sports officials have hailed the tour as a
major breakthrough in the international sports boycot imposed to
protest Pretoria's legal policy of race discrimination.

   India on Friday offered to withdraw
1,500 troops a week if the largest Tamil guerrilla group observes a
cease-fire, government sources said.
   Police said a strike called Friday by Sinhalese radicals to
protest 150 deaths disrupted normal life in the island nation, and
at least 15 people died in ethnic violence since Thursday,
including a Bhuddist priest.
   About 45,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to enforce a July
1987 peace accord aimed at ending a Tamil ethnic strife in the
Indian Ocean republic, where the government is dominated by the
Sinhalese majority.
   Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry sources said the Indian offer came
Friday before the two sides ended a weeklong talk in New Delhi
aimed at finding ways to make India withdraw its troops.
   ``At this moment I can say that the talks went on well,'' Sri
Lankan High Commissioner, or Ambassador S.S.P.P. Kalpage said.
``There are proposals and counter-proposals, and also there are ifs
and buts,'' Kalpage said in New Delhi, the Indian capital.
   But Sri Lankian Foreign Ministry sources in Colombo said India
agreed to withdraw 1,500 troops a week provided the main Tamil
guerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, observed a
cease-fire and that no Indians are attacked.
   The withdrawal also was conditional on Sri Lanka agreeing to
give more powers to the Tamil adminstration in the north and east
of Sri Lanka, where Tamils are a majority.
   Indian government officials in New Delhi were not available for
comment on the proposal. India has said that a hasty withdrawal
could cause even more bloodshed.
   Sinhalese-language posters signed by the guerrillas of the
Sinhalese People's Liberation Front warned businesses to close
Friday to protest the killing of 150 people by security forces a
week ago.
   Police and witnesses said the daylong strike appeared to be
successful as the usually-bustling capital was deserted. Shops and
offices were closed and vehicles stayed off the street.
   At least 150 people were killed July 28 when supporters of the
radicals defied a nationwide curfew and demonstrated against the
continued presence of Indian troops. Sinhalese radicals also oppose
the autonomy plan for Tamils.
   The government had said curfew violators would be shot on sight
to prevent what it calls a campaign of terror by the militants. The
curfew remains in effect from dusk to dawn.
   In Colombo, two Sinhalese men were killed Friday when a bomb
they were carrying exploded in Colombo, police said. A Sinhalese
woman was killed when troops fired at her vehicle which it did not
stop at a checkpoint.
   The priest, Kotikawatte Saddhatissa, was killed Thursday night
by six gunmen in a Colombo temple, police said. The gunmen were
suspected members of the Sinhalese People's Liberation Front, said
police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Saddhatissa, 72, a supporter of President Ranasinghe Premadasa,
is the second religious leader to be killed by the radicals. In
February, the front's gunmen killed Bodaramulle Subitha, the head
priest of the Kalutara temple, 25 miles south of Colombo.
   Six Indian soldiers and five Tamil Tiger militants were killed
in a gunbattle in the northern Jaffna peninsula on Thursday, said
Indian officials in New Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Some civilians were also killed, they said.
   Authorities blame the Sinhalese radicals for at least 4,000
killings and a series of crippling strikes since the start of an
anti-government uprising two years ago.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the 6-year-old Tamil insurgency.
   India became involved in the peace plan because of pressures
from its own 60 million Tamils who are sympathetic to the rebel
cause.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
have been fighting for an independent nation since 1983, claiming
they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population and control the government and the
military.

   Former House Speaker Jim Wright was spending
almost $100,000 a month on lawyers to defend himself against ethics
charges that consumed his final three months in office, his
campaign finance reports show.
   Wright's campaign finance reports, filed this week with the
Federal Election Commission, show that from March until May, he
spent $282,000 to pay his lawyers from the Washington firm of
Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg and Evans.
   Last year, Wright paid $78,734 to the firm, his records show.
That would bring the total to $360,734 from October through May.
   Shortly before Wright announced in May that he would abandon his
defense and resign, his supporters launched a fund-raising effort
to cover legal bills said at the time to be approaching $500,000.
   The supporters, who included Reps. Charles Wilson, J.J. Pickle,
Jack Brooks and Martin Frost, all Democrats from Texas, helped
organize a fund-raising event in Austin to finance Wright's legal
defense.
   That money was to be placed in a legal defense fund, which would
have had to disclose its finances next year if Wright had stayed in
office. However, under House rules, his departure means no such
public disclosure of the fund is required.
   Wright did non return telephone calls Friday to discuss the fund.
   Wright relinquished the speaker's gavel and left the House in
June.

<HEAD>And, Lo, Ryukyu's Stone _ Replaced at Last _ Honors ``Great Mandarin''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1854, Commodore Matthew C. Perry docked his
ships at Okinawa and, in telling of the wonders of America,
mentioned the monument being built in Washington in memory of ``the
great mandarin,'' George Washington.
   And, lo, the people of the Kingdom of Ryukyu _ Okinawa _
contributed a large stone from a quarry along with a 15th century
temple bell. The stone was to be placed into the wall of the
monument along with other commemorative stones and Perry planned to
hang the bell at the top of the monument.
   The bell made it to Washington; the stone didn't.
   But nobody noticed because by then the money to build the
monument had run out and it resembled a tree stump for another 25
years. Besides, a civil war and other matters occupied Washington.
   Fast forward 130 years to 1984. The Ryukyu America Historical
Research Society, an Okinawa civic organization, comes to
Washington to see the famous Ryukyu stone and discovers it isn't
there.
   Now it is the first Friday in August 1989. The temperature is 94
degrees, almost too hot even for tourists. At a ceremony on the
south side of the monument a replacement stone is unveiled by two
of 10 students who came from Okinawa for the occasion.
   ``This is a very important day for Okinawa,'' says Yukiko Koja,
one of the student delegates. ``This stone is important because it
symbolizes our long friendship with the United States of America.''
   The Japanese ambassador, the honorable Nobuo Matsunaga, calls
the occasion ``joyful'' and speaks of it as a cornerstone of future
development of cooperation.
   Eight dancers in kimonos do the traditional opening dance of
Okinawa as a record plays music. The lyrics are translated to
``today's happiness can be compared with the blossoming of a flower
when touched by dew.''
   Retired U.S. Navy Capt. Roger Pineau, who organized Perry's
papers in the 1960s, tells the gathering that the last mention of
the original stone was when it was transferred in Hong Kong. When
Perry received the stone from the Okinawan people, he said, there
also was a bill for $80. Embarrassed Okinawan officials, Pineau
said, apparently said they would take care of it.
   The new stone measures two feet by four feet by three inches and
weighs 396 pounds. Part of it was hollowed out for 53 pebbles from
nine Okinawa cities and 44 villages. It will be the 193rd
commemorative stone in the monument, only 15 of them from foreign
countries.
   It will be placed at the 310-foot level where the only people
who will see it are those who make arrangements to go down the
stairs of the 555-foot monument.
   As for the Gokokuji Bell _ it was never put in the monument.
Instead it was on display at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md., until 1986 when it was returned to the people of Okinawa as a
gesture of good will.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports Drop in Party Membership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party membership dropped by
35,000 in the first half of 1989 and the party has lost more than 1
million members in the last decade, a leading party weekly reported.
   The article in the Saturday edition of Polityka also pointed out
that nearly one-fifth of party members are retirees and that
workers are a minority in the party, whose formal name is the
Polish United Workers Party.
   Party membership stands just below 2.1 million, compared to 3.15
million in 1980, the article said, and most members occupy
management posts.
   The article noted that the communist coalition received only
about 25 percent of the vote for the freely elected Senate in June.
``So it is a minority, though a significant minority.''
   This year, 42,000 members left the party, while only 7,000
joined. Among those who left, 11,500 quit, 8,800 were dropped from
party rolls for showing ``lack of interest in party life,'' 8,000
changed jobs and did not re-register with the party at their new
workplaces and 1,300 emigrated.
   The article did not specify what accounted for the remaining
drop.
   The article quoted party documents as estimating only one-fourth
of the party membership is active, 60 percent do not meet the
party's rules for minimum participation and the remainder is
generally ``passive.''
   About one-third of the party membership thinks other political
groups do more to aid society's interests than the party does, and
about the same number do not believe it will be able to work out a
program that will keep it in power past 1993, the article said.
   Under this year's accords, fully democratic elections are to be
held that year.
   The article said retirees now account for a record 17.6 percent
of the membership and the average age of a party member is 46
compared to 40 in 1980.
   Although it claims to be the party of the working class, only
37.5 percent of the party are workers, compared with 52.1 percent
who are in the intelligentsia _ which refers to professions
requiring higher education such as managers, teachers, professors,
journalists, doctors and lawyers. The rest are in agriculture.

<TEXT>
   The acting head of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development's New York regional office is being
transferred to agency headquarters pending the outcome of three
investigations of her conduct, a department official said Friday.
   Geraldine McGann was told to report to Washington effective
Monday and will be assigned to nonmanagerial duties in the
department's office of housing, said the official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp last month placed McGann on
administrative leave from her $68,500-a-year job because of
questions about her role in awarding federal subsidies to housing
in Island Park, a small beachfront village that is home to Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   McGann, who in addition to her HUD job served as a village
trustee, and other Island Park officials have been accused of
rigging the distribution of HUD-subsidized houses in the early
1980s, ensuring that they went to politically connected townspeople
instead of minorities, as the program intended.
   McGann's son purchased one of the houses although he did not
qualify under HUD guidelines, according to a 1984 investigation by
HUD's inspector general. A cousin of D'Amato's also bought one of
the houses, although the senator maintains that he played no role
and that the man was qualified.
   McGann has also been accused of voting on HUD-related matters
before the town board. She has denied casting such votes but the
former town clerk recently said he was ordered to alter minutes to
show McGann had abstained.
   Her conduct is being investigated by HUD's inspector general,
the U.S. attorney's office in New York and the Nassau County
district attorney. HUD general counsel Frank Keating wrote to U.S.
Attorney Andrew J. Maloney on Thursday asking for a quick
resolution of the investigation and information about its scope.
   ``We are anxious to resolve her status as an employee but
obviously cannot do so as long as your investigation is under
way,'' Keating said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by
The Associated Press.
   Kemp last month prohibited HUD managers from serving on
government boards and said all HUD employees will be barred from
serving on government or other panels that could have HUD-related
dealings or benefit from agency programs.
   McGann was told she will be reassigned to Washington for up to
120 days, the official said. The department had to make the move
because it can put an employee on administrative leave for only 30
days. She is the highest-ranking HUD official to be affected in a
number of recent personnel moves related to the investigations of
abuse, influence-peddling and mismanagement.
   HUD has initiated the process of firing three former officials
at its Washington field office, including the office's former head,
because of alleged mismanagement. The head of the Richmond, Va.,
field office also was recently reassigned to nonmanagerial duties.
   As acting head of the New York regional office, McGann was
repsonsible for HUD programs and officials in New York, New Jersey
the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

   Final autopsy results Friday failed to
explain the death of an aviation officer candidate from Wisconsin
during an abandon-ship drill in a training pool, a Navy spokesman
said.
   Michael Fedie, 22, of Altoona, Wis., died of ``a seizure
disorder of unknown cause accompanied by acute cerebral edema,''
said Cmdr. Dennis Hessler of the Naval Education and Training
Command, which has its headquarters at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   ``The autopsy found no indication of trauma, pre-existing
disease or congenital abnormalities and no evidence of
hemorrhage,'' Hessler said. Although inconclusive, the autopsy was
still valuable because it did exclude those possible causes, he
said.
   Hessler also said the autopsy by the Armed Services Institute of
Pathology in Washington, D.C., did not change a preliminary finding
that no wrongdoing is indicated in the June 23 death.
   That was not the case in the death last year of another
Wisconsin trainee, also in a Pensacola training pool. Five enlisted
instructors were punished, including one sentenced to 90 days in
the brig for negligent homicide, and an officer was reprimanded for
the March 2, 1988, death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of
Appleton, Wis.
   Mirecki was undergoing rescue-swimmer training when he panicked
during a strenuous rescue drill, climbed from the pool and shouted
that he was quitting. Court-martial testimony indicated he had an
unusual fear of being pushed under water and suffered heart failure
and drowned after instructors pushed him back in the pool and held
his head under water.
   The death of Fedie drew unusual attention because of the
previous Mirecki investigation, which was pressed by Mirecki's
congressman after complaints were raised by his family about the
Navy's handling of the case.
   Fedie died during a different type of drill, one in which
aviation trainees jump off a 12-foot tower and swim about 15 yards
under water while wearing their flight suits. Most sailors go
through similar drills during basic training.
   Fedie completed the exercise and was walking from the pool when
he collapsed back into shallow water, witnesses said. Medical
examiners said there was little doubt of a seizure, but they were
uncertain whether it was triggered by the central nervous or
cardiovascular systems, Hessler said.

<HEAD>Premier Says Mine Settlement Will Cost $3 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's concessions to improve living and
working conditions for hundreds of thousands of coal miners will
cost more than $3 billion, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said Friday.
   Ryzhkov told official media that coming up with that sum will be
difficult for the financially strapped government, and cautioned
other workers not to expect the same concessions if they walk off
their jobs.
   The package of financial measures ``is not an easy one, and it
will require mobilization of the financial and material resources
of the country,'' Ryzhkov said in an interview on state-run
television.
   ``If we follow the road of strikes, no one will benefit from it,
and low-paid sections of the population will be hit first,'' the
official Tass news agency quoted him as saying. ``One should
understand that if others follow the miners' example, the country
may find itself in a most difficult situation.''
   The current package will cost 2 billion rubles ($3.2 billion).
Previous estimates of the cost of the package ranged up to 5
billion rubles ($8 billion.)
   Ryzhkov said the government had put together a series of
measures, many of which were submitted to the Supreme Soviet
legislature, which ended its first session Friday.
   The legislature presumably will be able to approve those
measures only when it resumes its work Sept. 25.
   Hundreds of thousands of miners in Siberia and the Ukraine
walked off their jobs in July in frustration over poor living and
working conditions.
   They returned to work after the government promised improvements.
   Miners of 17 mines in the Kuznetsk coal region of western
Siberia went on strike for two hours Thursday because they said the
government was not living up to its pledge to halt the operation of
a hydroelectric station they say is harming the environment.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more politicians of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party declared their candidacies Friday in next week's
election to choose Japan's new prime minister, throwing open what
once looked like a walkover election.
   Former Welfare Minister Yoshiro Hayashi, 62, and former
Transport Minister Shintaro Ishihara, 56, a prominent author, said
they will seek the party presidency in Tuesday's balloting.
   Until Friday, former Education Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 58, had
been considered a shoo-in for the job.
   The party president is assured of becoming prime minister
because of the Liberal Democrats' large majority in the lower house
of Parliament, which selects the prime minister.
   The winner Tuesday will be Japan's third prime minister since
June.
   The party has been crippled by an unpopular new sales tax and
money and sex scandals. Noboru Takeshita was forced to resign in
June. Sousuke Uno announced he would resign after only two months
in office following July 23 elections in which the Liberal
Democrats lost their majority in the upper chamber for the first
time since the party's formation in 1955.
   ``Our party must reform itself radically and reform politics
with an eye toward the future,'' Hayashi told a news conference
late Friday. ``I am determined to devote myself entirely to the
task.''
   Ishihara also called for party reforms and said, ``Politics do
not exist for politicians, but for the country. If we leave the
situation as it is now, factionalism and power politics will
continue to prevail.''
   Uno asked party members on Friday to refrain from factionalism
in the presidential race.
   Half a dozen major factions in the party are separated more by
personal and financial allegiances than their conservative
political leanings.
   The large faction led by former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
decided on Friday to support Hayashi, who belongs to one of the
party's smallest groups.
   Seiichi Ohta, a leading member of the Miyazawa faction, branded
Kaifu's candidacy a product of back room deals involving large
factions.
   ``It will disappoint the public,'' he said.
   Analysts said Kaifu remains the front-runner because of strong
backing from factions led by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
and former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe.
   The party's popular No. 2 official, Ryutaro Hashimoto, 52,
formally declined to run Friday, saying his candidacy would further
split the party.
   Former Defense Agency head Ganri Yamashita, 68, had said he
would run, but had to drop out Friday when he failed to draw enough
support from party members to become a candidate. He said he and
his supporters would back Hayashi.

<HEAD>Committee Proposes Charges Against Former Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Parliament committee proposed Friday
that a minister of the former Socialist government be charged with
complicity in an agricultural fraud that cheated the European
Economic Community.
   The 12-member committee investigated whether Nikos
Athanassopoulos, former deputy finance minister, was involved in
the alleged forgery of harbor logs and customs invoices to show
that 9,000 tons of Yugoslav maize sold to the Community in 1986 was
from Greece, an EEC member.
   In May, the European Court issued a ruling against Greece,
citing lost revenues to the EEC of $1.16 million. The sentence is
expected to be announced later this year.
   Athanassios Tsaldaris, speaker of Parliament, said floor debate
on the committee's proposal would take place late this month.
   After inconclusive elections in June, communists and
conservatives formed a coalition government to prosecute those
involved in several financial scandals that arose during the
Socialist administration of former Premier Andreas Papandreou.
   They said the coalition probably would stay in office only about
three months.
   The committee report indicated Athanassopoulos had tried to
cover up for whoever was behind the scheme, which defrauded the EEC
of import duties on the maize and caused it to pay subsidies for
produce from a nonmember nation.
   All five Socialist members of committee voted against the
proposal, which was supported by the six members from the
conservative New Democracy party and the single deputy from the
Coalition of the Left and Progress, which is dominated by the
Communist party.
   New Democracy has claimed the $1.16 million obtained by the
state-run ITCO trading company in the fraud is missing. The
Socialist Party denies it.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed hope
Friday that the hostage crisis can be ended when pro-Iranian
radicals provide specifics of their demands.
   He defended the action that precipitated the crisis: Israel's
abduction of a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored
Shiite Moslem group believed responsible for the kidnappings of
Westerners in Lebanon.
   Shamir said Israel had the right to act on its own to rescue its
captured soldiers whether the rest of the world agrees or not.
Israel has offered to trade Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and other
Lebanese Shiite prisoners for three Israeli soldiers and Western
hostages held in Lebanon.
   The prime minister and other top officials consulted on a
response to the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which suspended
its plans to kill an American hostage Thursday night and made new
demands on Israel.
   He said Israel was ``waiting for proposals'' from the captors of
Joseph Cicippio, who issued a statement saying they would provide a
list of ``Palestinian and Lebanese'' prisoners to be released.
   ``We hope we will get some proposals and it will be the end of
the crisis,'' Shamir said.
   Israel radio said Israeli leaders had hoped to receive a
response within hours, but now are convinced it will take much
longer.
   ``A prisoners exchange with Hezbollah is a complicated affair,
and it would last for a long time before a solution is found,'' it
quoted Finance Minister Shimon Peres as saying.
   On Monday, three days after commandos abducted Obeid from his
home in south Lebanon, a group of kidnappers calling themselves the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said they had hanged Lt. Col
William R. Higgins in retaliation.
   They released a poor-quality videotape of a man who appeared to
be the U.S. Marine colonel hanging from a gallows, but there was no
way of knowing when the tape was made. Some reports have said
Higgins, kidnapped in February 1988 while on U.N. duty in south
Lebanon, had been killed months ago.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's new president, was quoted as saying
Friday the first step toward ending the crisis would be for the
United States to ask Israel to free Obeid. Israel claims Obeid
planned guerrilla attacks against it and directed Higgins'
kidnapping.
   Israeli analysts said the developments indicate a willingness by
Shiite radicals to consider releasing hostages, and that vindicates
Israel's decision to kidnap Obeid.
   ``Israel put the issue of hostages back on the international
agenda,'' said Shlomo Avineri, a former Foreign Ministry
director-general.
   Until the current crisis, ``the West accepted people being
captured by bandits and had come to believe nothing could be done
about it,'' he said.
   Shlomo Gazit, a former military intelligence chief, said the
abduction triggered a new willingness by Hezbollah to consider
trading hostages.
   Without it, ``nothing would have happened and all the existing
hostages would be in the same hopeless situation as before.'' Gazit
said it also ``put the Israeli hostages on the agenda and that was
the exact purpose.''
   A government official said privately he doubted Israel would
free Obeid without something in return, and did not believe the
United States would ask that.
   ``If it's only freeing Obeid, what do the Americans get out of
it; what do we get out of it?'' he said.
   The statement from Cicippio's kidnappers repeated Obeid must be
released and added the demand for ``a number of'' Palestinians and
Lebanese. It did not say what would happen to Cicippio if the
Israelis refuse.
   More than 8,000 Palestinians have been jailed since an uprising
against Israeli occupation began 20 months ago in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Israel also has more than 60 Lebanese Shiite prisoners
and its allied militiamen in south Lebanon are believed to hold 300
more.
   While Israel has proposed an exchange of Shiite captives for the
Israeli soldiers and 16 Western hostages, eight of them Americans,
Israeli officials continue emphasizing that the first objective is
freeing the soldiers.
   On Israel radio, Shamir was quoted as saying he believed
negotiations on freeing the soldiers were closer. Asked about
freedom for the foreigners, he replied: ``If it will happen we will
be very happy.''
   The radio quoted officials as saying Israel would leave it to
the United States to ensure the safety of the American and other
hostages.
   In his defense of Obeid's abduction, Shamir said in a speech to
the United Jewish Appeal that Jewish tradition requires Israel's
unrelenting efforts to free its captured soldiers.
   ``We have no alternative but to apply pressure'' on the ``most
sensitive nerves'' of those holding them.
   ``Of course, we would prefer to have the civilized world
participating actively with us,'' the prime minister said. ``In any
case, we will stay our course.''

<HEAD>EPA Bans Ant Killer as Danger to Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday
banned household ant killers containing the chemical sodium
arsenate because of the danger of small children ingesting the
compounds.
   The EPA said the chemical is used to kill ants that are merely a
nuisance and do not threaten human health, food crops or wood
structures.
   EPA spokesman Ed Heier said the product is a surgary liquid made
by several companies and sold under numerous brand names. He said
that because the purchaser normally applies the ant killer and
leaves it exposed, it is not child-proof.
   Most often, the EPA said, the compound is applied to carboard,
wax paper, bottle caps or food to attract ants.
   The EPA's Ronald McCallum, who wrote the order banning the
pesticide, said that manufacturers of such compounds have failed to
show ``that the benefits of continued use of open sodium arsenate
baits to control household ants justifies the risks to human health
associated with the baits, particularly the risk to small
children.''
   In other action, the EPA said it had reached agreement with the
International Paper Co. in a case involving violatios of federal
clean air requirements at the company's Androscoggin mill in Jay,
Maine.
   The settlement, part of a consent decree, calls for the company
to pay a $900,000 fine for air pollution and begin a program to
reduce emissions from the plant.
   The agreement involved federal and state environmental officials
and the paper company.
   The EPA also announced a proposed $253,200 fine against Monsanto
Co., for its failure to promptly report to the EPA test results on
a new chemical even though the tests indicated the chemical may
pose a risk to public health.
   The agency said the test results were provided the EPA five
years late.
   Monsanto may appeal the proposed fine and request a formal
hearing, officials said.
   The chemical is called Santogard PVI and is used in the
processing of natural and synthetic products.

<HEAD>Denver Symphony Will Play Sharply Reduced Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS M. SEARLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The financially plagued Denver Symphony Orchestra
is making plans to play this season after all, thanks to a survival
plan approved Friday that includes shortening the season by half
and cutting musicians' salaries.
   The final two months of last season were canceled because of
lack of money, and observers had thought the odds were good the
upcoming season would be canceled outright.
   Terms of the plan approved by the orchestra's board include
negotiating pay cuts and concessions from its 81 musicians,
cutbacks in staff and operating costs, and winning writeoffs of
$3.2 million of the symphony's $4 million debt.
   The 1989-90 symphony season, which usually lasts 41 weeks and
begins in September, was pruned to 21 weeks and will begin Jan. 21,
1990. The board approved a $3.5 million budget for the limited
season, down from last season's $7.3 million.
   ``Although we regret the need to shorten the season, we feel
this is the financially prudent way to proceed,'' said Denver
Symphony Association Board Chairman John Low.
   He said that the season could still be canceled if the
orchestra's creditors refuse to forgive the debts.
   ``I want to emphasize I am optimistic about getting that debt
forgiven,'' he said. But if the goal of $3.2 million in forgiven
debts is not reached, he said, ``we're going to have to look very
hard at what that does to our ability to proceed.''
   Among the debts is $700,000 owed to the city for back rent for
Boettcher Hall. Some city council members have said they would
oppose any debt forgiveness.
   Earlier in the summer, the board rejected a proposed 27-week
season that was to have begun in November, citing the unresolved $4
million debt and the fact that musicians had not agreed to contract
concessions.
   Earlier this week, the symphony notified its musicians that
their health and dental benefits were canceled, saving the
association about $30,000 a month. Three years ago the musicians
agreed to 20 percent pay cuts to keep the symphony solvent.
   The symphony's financial problems have been blamed on Denver's
recession, the city's 10 percent seat tax, continual turnover in
management and the $600,000-a-month cash flow needed to operate the
symphony.

<TEXT>
   Just weeks before the mayoral primary, a former
top aide to Mayor Edward I. Koch has been indicted on charges he
lied when he denied that a city agency he ran was really a
patronage mill, a prosecutor said Friday.
   Joseph DeVincenzo, 46, indicted on 11 counts of perjury, ran the
city's Talent Bank, set up ostensibly to recruit women and
minorities to fill city posts. Critics said the agency was really
used to handle patronage requests, and doled out the highest paying
jobs to whites.
   The indictment said DeVincenzo lied when he told the State
Commission on Government Integrity at a public hearing that
politically connected job applicants were not given preference for
city government posts. Other witnesses contradicted this.
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky, who announced the
indictment, noted at a news conference that patronage is not
illegal and said there was no underlying crime in the case.
   But he said the grand jury found that DeVincenzo committed
perjury by lying to cover up his patronage dealings at commission
hearings on July 13 and 21 last year and Jan. 11 this year.
   The indictment was filed Thursday, Cherkasky said. DeVincenzo
pleaded innocent at his arraignment and was released on his own
recognizance. A hearing was scheduled for Aug. 11.
   The indictment comes less than six weeks before the primary
election in which Koch is seeking the Democratic nomination for an
unprecedented fourth term. His opponents sought to capitalize on
the indictment but Koch declared: ``I don't think it does anything
to my campaign. There's nothing to hide here.''
   The Koch administration has been shaken by several scandals,
particularly since his election to a third term in November 1985.
Six of the mayor's appointees have been jailed and about 200
lower-level city employees have been convicted of various crimes.
   The scandals have ranged from the serious _ kickbacks from
collection agencies hired by the Parking Violations Bureau _ to the
trivial _ the chef at the mayoral Gracie Mansion used city
equipment for his catering business. Bess Myerson, a city
commissioner, was acquitted of charges she tried to fix her
boyfriend's divorce case.
   Speaking about the Job Bank case, Koch said Friday that compared
with patronage at the state capital in Albany and in Washington,
the use of patronage in his administration ``is piddling and
legal.''
   But Koch said lying to the commission is ``simply unacceptable''
and that he would have counseled DeVincenzo to tell the truth.
   Some witnesses testified to the commission that files at the
Talent Bank were sometimes marked with color codes, indicating a
political sponsor might have referred an applicant to DeVincenzo.
   His own assistant, James G. Hein, testified that DeVincenzo had
ordered him in February 1986 to ``cleanse'' the computer and paper
employment files of ``any references to political figures.''
   Six month ago, Koch announced that he had asked for DeVincenzo's
resignation. But DeVincenzo had already filed papers to resign,
ensuring his pension of $52,000 a year.
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, reached by telephone in
Massachusetts, said his office did consider the timing of the
indictment, so close to the election, but conlcuded that ``we could
not be in the role of censor, deciding what the public could and
could not hear.''
   First-degree perjury is punishable by a maximum of seven years
in prison.

<HEAD>Cypriot Archbishop Hails U.S. Decision on Looted Treasures</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Chrysostomos one name is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Chrysostomos of Cyprus on
Friday hailed a U.S. court decision restoring looted mosaics to his
church as opening the way for the recovery of stolen archaelogical
treasures worldwide.
   ``We are overjoyed by the decision of the American court,'' said
Chrysostomos, head of the Greek Orthodox church in Cyprus.
   ``This encourages us to seek the recovery of other looted
treasures because it will discourage international art merchants
who deal in such stolen property,'' he said in an interview.
   U.S. District Judge James E. Noland in Indiana ruled Thursday
that four 6th-century mosaics purchased by an Indianapolis art
dealer were the property of the Cyprus church and should be
returned to it.
   But attorneys for both sides were unable to reach an agreement
on when the artwork would be released, and they were back before
Noland in Indianapolis late Friday afternoon.
   In his ruling Thursday, Noland said dealer Peg Goldberg never
obtained title to the mosaics, which she bought last summer in
Switzerland.
   The ruling did not address damages, custody or transfer of the
mosaics, which remained locked in an Indianapolis vault while
attorneys negotiated for their release.
   The mosaics depict the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ and the
apostles. They were removed from the walls of the church of The
Virgin of Kanakaria in the village of Lythrangomi in north Cyprus,
which has been under Turkish occupation since 1974.
   Ms. Goldberg, of suburban Indianapolis, bought the mosaics from
a Turkish middleman, Aydin Dikmen, for $1.1 million and offered
them for sale to the Paul Getty Museum in California for $20
million.
   The Cyprus government has accused Turkish authorities and the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus of allowing the
systematic looting of churches and rich archaelogical sites to
eradicate the Christian and Greek cultural heritage of the island,
going back more than three thousand years.
   The Cyprus church and the Cyprus government sued for the
recovery of the mosaics when informed by the Getty museum of the
development.
   The Indiana court decision had been awaited eagerly by
international art circles as a precedent for the recovery of looted
artifacts worldwide.
   ``On the basis of this decision we shall now proceed to demand
the return of numerous other ecclesiastical treasures looted from
churches and monasteries in the Turkish-occupied region,''
Chrysostomos said.
   Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since a Turkish
invasion in 1974. The breakaway state established in north Cyprus
in 1985, which is only recognized by Turkey, argued unsuccessfully
in the Indiana court that the mosaics should be returned to it.

   President Bush vowed Friday to explore ``to
the fullest'' an overture by Iran's new leader to help resolve the
hostage crisis, while decrying the ``brutal process'' the hostages
and their families are undergoing.
   ``I don't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment, but there's
reason to be somewhat encouraged,'' Bush said when asked about
comments by Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Rafsanjani said there were ``prudent solutions'' to the hostage
situation and offered to help find them. While Bush voiced guarded
optimism, his chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ``We are
always skeptical of what we hear'' from Iran.
   Fitzwater said that while no efforts had been made by the
president or other top U.S. officials to deal with Iranian
officials directly, information was being exchanged with that
country's leaders on the situation through third-country
intermediaries.
   Meanwhile, the president and his aides sought to play down talk
of a possible military strike against targets in Lebanon if another
U.S. hostage were killed.
   ``If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the last
place I'd be talking about it,'' Bush said, speaking with reporters
during a picture-taking session in the Oval Office.
   Fitzwater, meanwhile, denied that Bush had selected specific
targets in Lebanon for an air strike if kidnappers had carried out
a threat to kill American hostage Joseph Cicippio.
   ``I will say he did not make final decisions,'' Fitzwater said,
referring to a story in Friday's New York Times that Bush was
prepared to order the Sixth Fleet to launch air strikes against
suspected terrorist strongholds, including a base in eastern
Lebanon.
   ``It does not help the United States government or the United
States to be discussing military tactics ... to be flexing our
muscles in public,'' Fitzwater said. ``We do not believe it's in
the best interests of releasing the hostages.''
   A day after Cicippio's captors said they had spared him, at
least for the present, Bush said he was ``certainly pleased that
that brutal murder that had been threatened had been set aside.''
   On Rafsanjani's offer to help, Bush said: ``When you see a
statement that offers hope for the return of our hostages, I want
to explore it to the fullest.'' Iran is thought to have strong
influence over Shiite Moslem militants holding Americans captive.
   Bush continued: ``I'm encouraged. But I don't want to get the
hopes of the hostages' loved ones up once again, to have those
hopes dashed. This is a brutal process, where you see people
paraded before cameras and their families get their hopes up.''
   Bush called the head of the Geneva-based International Red
Cross, Cornelio Sommaruga, to voice support for that humanitarian
agency's efforts to win freedom for the hostages, according to
Fitzwater.
   ``He (Bush) wanted him to know we appreciated their efforts. We
hope they're successful,'' said Fitzwater. ``The United States is
willing to be of any help we can.''
   Efforts by the Red Cross were alluded to in Rafsanjani's
statement, Fitzwater noted.
   He said the United States would stand firmly behind its vow not
to negotiate for the release of hostages. ``We have our policy and
that's what we follow,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani made his comments during a prayer sermon at Tehran
University, broadcast on Tehran radio. While warning against U.S.
``bullyings, arrogant speeches and tyranny,'' Rafsanjani said:
``Come, let us approach the problem reasonably.''
   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions;
the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent
solutions.''
   However, Rafsanjani's offer appeared conditional. He urged the
United States to take the initiative by pressuring Israel to
release the Shiite Moslem cleric it abducted a week ago, Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid.
   The kidnapping triggered the apparent execution of Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins and the death threat against Cicippio.
   Although officials have said the United States would not seek to
dictate hostage policy to Israel, Bush on Friday reiterated an
appeal he first made Monday night for all countries holding
hostages to release them.
   ``I would just appeal to the civilized world or any country
anywhere in the world to lay aside this holding of people against
their will _ hostages _ and do what is right and decent and
honorable in terms of the release of those hostages that are still
held,'' the president said.
   Bush, who White House aides said had called more than a dozen
world leaders over the past few days in an effort to bring pressure
on the kidnappers, cited a ``very extraordinarily broad exercise of
diplomacy here in the last couple of days.''
   Fitzwater later said diplomatic contacts were continuing.
``There are still a lot of people talking to a lot of people in the
region about how to get the hostages out,'' he said.
   He also said that ``we've had high level and continuing talks
with Israel,'' even though the president himself hasn't talked
directly with Israeli leaders.
   Bush was asked if Cicippio deserved the full backing of the
United States, in view of the fact that he ignored U.S. warnings to
leave Lebanon.
   ``That doesn't mean we wash our hands of it,'' Bush said. ``He's
an American and he is entitled to the concern of the president, and
every one of these senators and everybody in our administration.
And he's got a great, big, wonderful family up there that are
eating their hearts out in Norristown, Pa.''
   Bush said he had not talked with members of the Cicippio family
but ``the State Department has been in daily contact with them _
daily.''

<TEXT>
   A group of adoptees, birth mothers and
adoptive parents wound up a 250-mile march from New York to the
nation's capital Friday pressing for the unsealing of confidential
birth records.
   But the president of another adoption group disagreed with their
point, saying, ``People have a right to privacy.''
   Forty members of the American Adoption Congress ended the
2{-week trek by rallying in front of the District of Columbia's
Office of Vital Records while five members went inside to request
original birth certificates.
   The three birth mothers and two adoptees were turned down _ as
other members of the group had been in New York, Philadelphia and
Baltimore _ after they spoke to D.C. Registrar Jack Crandall.
   Crandall, an adoptive father himself, explained, ``I have the
old nothing answer, I guess, because it's the law. The law says
that when a person is adopted ... we create a new birth certificate
and the old certificate is under seal and can only be opened by
order of the court.''
   Birth mothers told of the pain of giving up their infants and
then struggling to find them years later.
   ``It's understood that you're giving him up to people who are so
much better, and you don't have any rights at all,'' said Laura
Lewis, 39, of suburban Maryland.
   Adopted children spoke of their frustrations in trying to trace
their blood roots while being denied access to original birth
records, including medical histories.
   ``I've just been diagnosed as hypoglycemic,'' said Jannine
Sutherland, 42, of Gaithersburg, Md., ``and I want to know, does
diabetes run in my family?''
   But William Pierce, president of the National Committee for
Adoption, which represents 141 adoption agencies and 2,000
individuals, said in a telephone interview, ``The courts have said
rather clearly that ... a person's right to privacy is greater than
the right to the information.''
   Adoption Congress president Kate Burke said, ``If a birth mother
doesn't want to be found, all she has to say is, `I don't want a
relationship''' when her child contacts her.
   Pierce said he favored a ``middle-of-the-road compromise.''
   ``There should be a sensitive legal way for adults to be able to
get together if they both want to,'' he said, describing a mutual
consent arrangement in 22 states that allows birth mothers and
their adult children to meet if both register to express such a
desire.
   Ten states have a system that allows adult adoptees to request a
search for their mothers, said Pierce. If she is located, the woman
can decide whether she wants to meet the child.
   Three states _ Alaska, Alabama and Kansas _ open records once an
adoptee reaches age 18, and the remainder of the states have sealed
records, Pierce said.

<TEXT>
   A city alderman who left behind his
wallet and his Cadillac to spend five days on the streets said he's
gained a new perspective on what it's like to be homeless.
   ``It was a good experience for me,'' Michael Wooden, 39, said on
his return Thursday to his job as senior spokesman for Humana Inc.,
the giant hospital company. ``I learned a lot.''
   Wooden began his adventure Saturday, when he set off with a
quarter in his pocket and a change of socks and underwear in a gym
bag. Calling himself Mike Wayne, he told people he was passing
through town, out of work and looking for a job and a place to
sleep.
   After a night on a bench at a downtown plaza, Wooden found his
way to a shelter _ and began to enjoy himself, he said.
   He was ``adopted'' by a man named Frank, who, along with Wooden,
was staying at the Wayside Christian Mission downtown.
   Frank showed Wooden how to panhandle. The alderman said he
didn't feel very comfortable asking people for spare change; most
ignored him or mumbled that they didn't have change.
   Wooden said that by Wednesday he fit in with the men at the
shelter. That afternoon, a group of them sat on a corner, laughing.
The other men were drinking, and Wooden smoked cigars he bought
after selling his blood for $15.
   ``We had the best time,'' he said. ``I like to meet people. So I
found that part of this adventure fun and exciting.
   ``They've all got serious problems,'' Wooden said. ``But they're
making the best of a bad situation, and some of them are managing
to have fun and laugh and joke.''
   Wooden had planned to stay on the streets a week, but said that
by Wednesday he'd done what he set out to do: ``meeting some of the
people, knowing what kind of services were available and really
living the life.''
   The alderman said he might not have time to introduce ordinances
or otherwise help the homeless during the six months left in his
term, but plans to ask workers in missions and shelters what the
Board of Aldermen can do for Louisville's estimated 1,200 homeless.
He said he might volunteer his own time.
   Wooden said that as he drove to work Thursday, he spotted some
of the men he'd gotten to know at the shelter.
   ``For the first time, I can see them as real human beings with
feelings and families,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Around Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms carrying heavy rain developed Friday around the
Great Lakes and the Upper Midwest, and one stream flooded near
Chicago.
   Lower Michigan got the heaviest rain from showers and
thunderstorms associated with the remnants of Hurricane Chantal.
Tuscola County, in the ``thumb'' of the mitten-shaped state, got
over 3{ inches in over four hours, the National Weather Service
said. In west-central Lower Michigan, Grant got 5 inches of rain in
the morning and Sparta reported 4{ inches.
   In the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.44 inches of rain fell at
Muskegon, Mich., and in Wisconsin 1.45 inches fell at Milwaukee.
   More thunderstorms associated with Chantal developed from
southeastern Ontario across Lake Erie into northeastern Ohio.
   Heavy rain that moved through the Chicago area early in the
morning made Salt Creek rise 4 feet above flood stage and caused
flooding in the northwest suburb of Rolling Meadows, the weather
service said.
   Thunderstorms also developed in very unstable, humid air over
southern Minnesota. These storms formed ahead of a cold front that
was pushing through the upper Mississippi Valley and the central
Plains.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms with a potential for heavy downpours
developed in very humid air over southern Arizona.
   Out in the open Atlantic, Hurricane Dean was 210 miles northeast
of San Juan, Puerto Rico, moving slowly towards the north.
   A large upper-level high pressure system anchored over the
southern half of the nation produced warm weather across much of
the nation. Temperatures rose into the 90s from the middle and
southern Atlantic Coast across the Ohio and Mississippi valleys to
the central and southern Plains, where northern Kansas climbed
above 100.
   Around the Great Lakes, Marquette, Mich., hit a record high of
90 and Duluth, Minn., tied its record of 92.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Everett, Wash., to 105 at Hill City, Kan. Friday's low
in the Lower 48 states was 35 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Saturday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the upper and middle Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes
and the upper Ohio Valley to the northern and middle Atlantic
Coast. Scattered thunderstorms also were forecast over the Florida
Peninsula.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast, over
northern Maine, and from eastern Montana across North Dakota into
Upper Michigan; in the 80s from the Pacific Northwest across the
northern and central Rockies, South Dakota and Nebraska, much of
the Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley into New England; above 100
across southwestern Texas, the desert Southwest and inland valleys
of California; and in the 90s over much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Seven people were indicted Friday on money
laundering charges stemming from a nationwide IRS investigation
that has already netted 19 convictions, including that of former
Rep. Pat Swindall of Georgia.
   The seven men are charged with laundering money they were told
was the profit of a south Florida drug trafficker. The cash
actually was supplied by an undercover IRS agent, according to the
indictment.
   The money laundering investigation has been under way since 1987
and has so far resulted in 19 convictions in Baltimore, Atlanta,
Tulsa, Okla.; Dallas; and San Juan, Puerto Rico; the IRS said in a
statement.
   Former Rep. Robert Hanrahan, R-Ill., has pleaded guilty to
violating currency laws, and last month Swindall was convicted of
10 counts of lying to a grand jury about his involvement in the
scheme.
   The IRS sting also has nabbed attorneys, bankers and a former
Nixon aide.
   According to Friday's indictment, the seven Massachussets and
Connecticut men tried to circumvent federal laws that require banks
to report cash transactions of more than $10,000, dividing up money
into smaller sums, exchanging cash for checks, which they swapped
amongst themselves, and buying insurance annuitites under fake
names.
   Charges against them include conspiracy to defraud the
government of over $1 million, lying to the government and filing
false currency reports.
   Indicted were: Peter E. Knox, 42, of Littleton; Edmond P.
LaFrance, 44, of Stoneham; Richard A. LaFrance, 51, of Acton;
Alfred G. Maroun 57, of Boston; Donald J. Mackinnon, Jr., 55, of
Boston; William H. O'Leary, Sr., 65, of Westwood; and Frank S.
Sottile, 60, of Simsbury, Ct.
   Two Massachusetts businesses were also charged, Maroun Brothers,
Inc., a food distributor in Lawrence, and FDM Corp., doing business
as Barnaby's restaurant in Littleton.
   Reached at his business Friday, Maroun said the indictments came
as a total surprise.
   He said he did not know any of the other defendants and had
never met Charles LeChasney, an informant who has figured in
several of the cases.
   ``This is sort of a very odd situation,'' he said, referring
other questions to his attorney.
   Richard LaFrance said federal investigators had asked to examine
his books about a year and a half ago. ``They didn't really ask
anything, they just took the records and left,'' he said.
   The other defendants could not be reached for comment. Knox and
O`Leary were not listed in the telephone directory. Edmond LaFrance
and Mackinnon did not return telephone calls to their homes, and
calls to Sottile's home went unanswered.
   Prosecutor Patrick Walsh, a special attorney with the Department
of Justice in Washington, said Edmond LaFrance was arrested, but
has not yet entered a plea. The others face arraignment next week,
he said.
   Walsh said the investigation in each city has relied on the same
undercover IRS agent posing as a front man for drug dealers, and
the same confidential informant.
   An admitted con man convicted of money laundering, LeChasney,
testified in June against Swindall and also figured in the case
against Robert C. Schultz, a Washington banker. Prosecutors said
Schultz advised LeChasney and Hanrahan on how to set up bank
accounts to shield money laundering activities. Schultz pleaded
guilty and is to be sentenced Sept. 20.
   Walsh would not comment on whether any of the New England men
also had dealings with LeChasney.
   The indictment alleges that the defendants received commissions
of 6 percent to 8 percent on the money they laundered, and filtered
the money through more than a dozen Massachusetts and Connecticut
banks.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley has missed a deadline to
correct what state officials said were four years' worth of
omissions in his financial disclosure statements, according to a
published report.
   The state Fair Political Practices Commission told the mayor,
whose financial dealings are under investigation by state, local
and federal officials, in a June 23 letter to provide the
information within 20 days, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner
reported Friday.
   Among the information requested were exact dates and details
involving stock transactions with which the five-term mayor was
involved.
   The commission first asked Bradley to amend his financial
disclosure forms in May.
   ``They keep saying soon,'' commission spokeswoman Sandra
Michioku said of the delay by Bradley's people.
   Mark Fabiani, one of Bradley's attorneys, said amending the
financial statements has taken longer than was expected. He said
the commission would have the forms by next Friday.
   ``We have simply been trying to reconstruct the last four years
of the mayor's financial life, and that has involved a search for
original source material, including account and bank statements,''
Fabiani said.
   Bradley has scheduled a meeting of close political advisers
Saturday at his Hancock Park home to discuss the mounting legal
bills he faces as a result of the various probes.
   Fabiani said the group would look into ways of raising money for
the newly formed Bradley Officeholder Committee, which could use
the funds it collects to pay Bradley's legal bills.

<HEAD>Proposed Temporary Regulations Completed by Mosbacher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shrimpers could abandon turtle excluder
devices in favor of limited trawls to keep endangered sea turtles
from drowning in their nets under proposed temporary Commerce
Department regulations completed Friday and scheduled to take
effect Tuesday.
   Department spokesman Reed Boatright said Secretary Robert A.
Mosbacher finished the proposal Friday and would submit the plan
limiting trawl times to 105 minutes to U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Hogan on Monday.
   In a court hearing Thursday, Hogan gave Mosbacher until Monday
to draft a plan to protect endangered sea turtles from becoming
entangled in shrimpers' nets.
   Environmentalists, however, said Friday that the Kemp's ridley
sea turtle faces quick extinction if the government abandons turtle
excluder devices in favor of limited shrimp-fishing trawl times.
   The Center for Marine Conservation and other organizations want
Mosbacher to require shrimpers to use turtle excluder devices.
Shrimpers, however, say the devices reduce their catch and threaten
their livelihood.
   The center's Marydele Donnelly said limited trawl times
``condemn the Kemp's ridley sea turtle to extinction within this
century.''
   ``A major confrontation looms ahead on sea turtle protection,''
Ms. Donnelly said. ``Secretary Mosbacher needs to move swiftly to
enforce federal environmental laws protecting endangered species.
Restricted tow times, unlike TEDs, will hasten the day when sea
turtles will no longer exist in American waters.''
   Uhder Mosbacher's proposal, shrimpers would have about 7{
minutes to get their nets in, and 7{ minutes to get them out, with
actual trawl time limited to 90 minutes, Boatright said.
   While the Commerce Department contends that sea turtles can
survive submerged for 90 minutes, conservationists argue limited
trawl times are ineffective in reducing turtle mortality and cannot
be enforced.
   The center said the government's most recent analysis found that
one in four sea turtles will drown during a tow time of 105 minutes.
   It said gulf shrimpers normally leave their nets in the water
for two to 10 hours.
   Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the turtle excluder device
regulations July 24 after shrimpers protested the law.

<HEAD>Commission Formed to Investigate Terrorism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush announced Friday he was forming
a seven-member commission to investigate air terrorism, with
particular emphasis on the bombing last December of Pan Am Flight
103.
   Bush, in an executive order, said the Commission on Aviation
Security and Terrorism would study the adequacy of security
procedures.
   ``The commission also shall review options for handling
terrorist acts involving aviation,'' Bush's order said.
   The commission will be composed of seven members appointed by
the president _ including two senators and two members of the
House. The chairman of the group would be picked by the president
from among the members.
   The panel also will study the issue of public notification of
bomb threats, the order said.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement that ``ongoing, intensive investigations into all aspects
of the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 will not be affected by the
commission's work. Rather, the commission will focus on the need
for additional measures to improve aviation security.''
   The move was applauded by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who had
worked with Bush in forming the panel.
   ``Every American has grieved afor the victims of Flight 103 and
shared the grief of their families. Although the headlines of the
tragedy have faded, questions still linger,'' Mitchell said.
   ``They involve basic factual questions such as what kind of
aviation security measures may be necessary under what conditions?
What kind of warnings should be given to the traveling public?
Where, exactly, responsibility should lie between airports,
airlines, the federal government and foreign governmetns in seeking
to protect the security of Americans travelling abroad,''
Mitchell's statement said.
   Dole called Bush's move ``a good initiative.''
   Flight 103, a Boeing 747 exploded above Lockerbie, Scotland,
when a bomb went off on Dec. 21, killing 270 people.

   Reporters bowed in respect as Japan's Emperor
Akihito broke with imperial tradition Friday and held the throne's
first televised news conference since 1975.
   Akihito, seated beside Empress Michiko, began the news
conference by expressing gratitude to 10,000 people who attended
the state funeral and the hundreds of thousands who lined the
streets after his father, Hirohito, died in January at 87.
   ``What I felt while I was in personal contact with Emperor Showa
gives me, I think, an important guideline in what an emperor should
be,'' said Akihito, referring to Hirohito's posthumous name.
   Hirohito's 62-year reign _ the longest in Japanese history _
covered Japan's disastrous war in Asia and its subsequent rise to
an economic superpower.
   Because of the constitution's strict ban on his exercising
political powers, Akihito could not comment on the crisis facing
Japan's governing conservatives, plagued by money and sex scandals.
   He said he would be willing to visit China and Korea _ two
victims of Japanese aggression _ if the government decided it was
appropriate. He said the same for Okinawa, Japan's southernmost
prefecture, where many people remain bitter about the casualties
and destruction they bore in the U.S. military assault. Hirohito
never visited Okinawa after the war.
   Akihito said the Daijo-sai, an elaborate ascension rite with
strong Shinto significance, should be carried out in accordance
with the law. Many critics already argue that by its very nature it
violates the constitution's ban of state involvement in religious
affairs.
   In that mystical ceremony to be held next year, Akihito is to
have his first communion with the gods and then be reborn divine.
Media reports have estimated it could cost as much as $70 million.
The government is studying how to conduct the rite.
   Reporters representing 43 Japanese and 12 foreign news
organizations attended the news conference. Journalists were given
a detailed explanation of when to rise and bow, and who would sit
where in the palace's Stone Bridge Room, a large hall with Japanese
sliding paper doors and Western-style red carpeting.
   Sitting behind a low table draped with gold brocade cloth
embroidered with chrysanthemums, the imperial symbol, the royal
couple spoke slowly and distinctly. At times the empress, wearing a
light green dress, spoke so softly her voice was drowned out by the
clicking of cameras.
   Akihito also spoke in polite but common Japanese, unlike his
father, who often used archaic or stilted words no longer
understood by the general public.
   Akihito repeatedly stressed that his proper role is to uphold
Japan's postwar constitution, which limits his role to that of a
``symbolic'' figurehead.
   Four of the 12 main questions, all submitted weeks in advance
and subject to government approval, were about Hirohito. Along with
the main questions, several follow-ups were allowed, but by
pre-decided Japanese questioners.
   One Imperial Household Agency official requested the scheduled
time limit of 30 minutes be carefully observed, because traffic
restrictions had been set for streets on the imperial couple's way
home. The conference lasted 37 minutes.
   Akihito is the first emperor to ascend the throne under the
postwar constitution, which limits his role to mostly ceremonial
tasks. The previous constitution gave Hirohito nominal powers, and
the wartime government asserted it was acting in his name.
   The constitution also omits all references to the emperor's
special relationship with the gods of Shinto, Japan's indigenous
religion, which angers some conservatives.
   Japan's monarchy can trace its history to at least the 8th
century, and by legend until the 6th century B.C. and Emperor
Jimmu, who is said to have descended from the sun goddess,
Amaterasu.
   Michiko, rarely changing her expression of polite concentration,
said that because of her husband's heavy responsibilities she must
``make the home a place where he can...find peace and relaxation
with his family.''
   The royal couple split with the past by raising their two sons
and daughter by themselves. Akihito was raised by chamberlains from
age 3.
   Their eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, 29, is now seeking a
bride, and when asked about his growing independence, Michiko said,
``It would make me happy if he would come, even if only from time
to time, to play the viola for us.''

   The Texaco oil company signed an
agreement with the government Friday to explore and possibly
develop deposits as part of an investment that could total several
hundred million dollars.
   The initial investment calls for $25 million over five years to
search for oil in fields located near Argentina's hot, dry northern
border with Paraguay. The company also reportedly wants to buy
about 250 gas stations.
   Company vice president Robert Black said Texaco eventually might
invest ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' in the South American
nation.
   Texaco Inc. helped develop Argentina's reserves after oil was
discovered accidentally in southern Chubut Province in 1907.
   The company left the country in 1953 when profits dropped,
government regulation increased and the state oil company YPF took
greater control of the petroleum program.
   President Carlos Menem, who took office July 8, has announced
that he wants to sell off inefficient state industries and attract
foreign investment.
   YPF is projected to lose $1 billion this year.

<HEAD>At British Auction, American Civil War Newspapers Hottest Sellers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American newspapers that recorded events from the
Civil War were the hottest sellers Friday at an auction of old
newspapers, the auctioneers Bonhams said.
   The newspapers were sold by an anonymous English collector who
said his family was ``being driven bananas by all my newspapers all
over the house,'' but that he was so avid he was keeping newspapers
mentioning the auction.
   About 300 newspapers were sold for a total of about $5,000, said
auctioneer Duncan Chilcott.
   ``The trend from the sale would suggest that there's a great
market for 17th century and 18th century newspapers and an even
better market for American newspapers,'' Chilcott said.
   ``American newspapers describing the Civil War, they were most
eagerly sought after, they were the ones we had the most
competition for from the bidders,'' he said.
   The oldest newspaper in the sale, The Perfect Diurnall, of Aug.
28, 1648, fetched the highest price, about $246.
   The newspaper, which reported Oliver Cromwell's new model army
capturing the town of Colchester, was produced by Parliament and
was principally a record of parliamentary debates.
   The older newspapers were generally in better condition because
the quality of modern paper is such that a newspaper exposed to
light can turn yellow within a week.
   The most modern newspapers for sale _ recording the Falklands
War and the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana _ didn't sell,
Chilcott said.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega signed an
accord with opposition leaders Friday urging that the Contra rebels
be disbanded, and he said he would press for the breakup at a
summit of Central American leaders.
   ``I hope the U.S. government will respect this sovereign
decision of the Nicaraguan people and change U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua, and that it puts an end to the (1985) economic
embargo,'' Ortega said before leaving for the weekend conference in
Tela, Honduras.
   The United States wants the rebels to stay organized until after
Nicaragua holds general elections next year.
   Ortega talked to reporters shortly after he signed the
agreement, worked out during 22 hours of talks between the leftist
Sandinista government and leaders from 20 opposition parties.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in Washington that the
rebels support the same principles that were laid out in Friday's
agreement, adding: ``We are not opposed to the question of
reintegrating ourselves into Nicaragua under democratic conditions.
But those conditions have to be negotiated.''
   In the accord, the Sandinistas pledge to hold free and fair
elections Feb. 25, without any restraints on campaigning or news
censorship. They promise to suspend the military draft from
September until after the balloting to prevent it from interfering
with electoral activity.
   The Sandinistas initiated the negotiations to defuse complaints
by opposition leaders that their candidates were harassed in
earlier elections, their movements constrained and their exposure
to the public restricted by news censorship.
   The presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and
Guatemala will join Ortega in Tela.
   Adolfo Calero, a member of the rebel political directorate,
already has expressed his determination to keep the Contras
operating.
   Opposition leaders told reporters they were generally satisfied
with Friday's agreement, even though it was not all they wanted.
   ``No country, however powerful, has the right to interfere in
the Nicaraguan electoral process,'' Jaime Bonilla of the
Independent Liberal Party said, speaking for a coalition of 14 of
the 20 parties.
   ``Even though the opposition is not completely satisfied, the
electoral process is being channeled toward what the opposition
wants. The accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the
peace process at the summit.''
   The Tela summit Saturday and Sunday will be the fifth held under
a peace plan that President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica drafted in
August 1987 to negotiate an end to Nicaragua's civil war and
leftist insurrections in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   The focus will be on Nicaragua and the 12,000 Contras, now
living with their dependents in base camps in southern Honduras.
   The United States provided the Contras with military aid until a
year ago. It now sends them only non-lethal aid such as clothing
and food.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras says the Contras are an
economic burden and that he wants them out of his country.
   Ortega said he hoped ``the Honduran government feels stronger
now to push for the demobilization of the Contras in Honduran
territory.''
   Friday's accord also calls for undercover activities to halt
during Nicaragua's electoral process. The Sandinistas also promise
to grant unconditional amnesty to all political prisoners, a move
that will benefit 1,605 rebels in Nicaraguan jails.
   The United States began supporting the Contras in 1982 and
declared an economic embargo on Nicaragua three years later,
arguing that Sandinista efforts to impose a leftist government and
the Sandinistas' close military ties with Moscow and Havana
threatened security in Central America.
   The Bush administration supports the Arias peace plan but says
the Contras should not be disbanded until after the elections.
Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, visited Guatemala this week to press that point.
   A senior State Department official in Washington, briefing
reporters on the Aronson trip on condition of anonymity, cited
complaints that the Sandinista government is mounting raids on
suspected Contra sympathizers in northern Nicaragua and failed to
create fair conditions for political opponents.
   The Contras' Calero said he was ``elated that President Bush has
come out unequivocally in favor of having the resistance remain as
a viable force.''
   He said the process of democratization in Nicaragua remain only
promises by the Sandinista government, adding, ``You do not take
down the scaffold before the building is finished.''

   Dominic Behan, a playwright and
balladeer whose brother was the late writer Brendan Behan, has died
at age 61, his family said Friday.
   He died Thursday after an illness of several months, the family
said.
   Dominic Behan's first novel, ``The Public World of Parable
Jones,'' was published this year.
   Among his plays was ``Posterity for the Damned,'' a reflection
on what he viewed as the follies of the Irish Republican Army,
staged at the Gaiety Theater in Dublin in 1959.
   His play ``The Folk Singer,'' a series of songs about Northern
Ireland, appeared on Northern Ireland television in 1972. Among his
other songs were ``The Patriot Game'' and ``Liverpool Lou.''
   Dominic Behan is survived by his wife, Josephine, and sons
Fintan and Stephen.
   Brendan Behan died in 1964.

   President Bush complained to Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell on Friday that 120 of his appointments are
languishing in the Senate as lawmakers prepare to begin a long
summer recess.
   Mitchell said he told the president he wasn't dragging his feet,
that some delays had been requested by Republican senators and that
he would be as prompt as possible.
   Mitchell also said he turned down a request by Bush for an
immediate vote by the full Senate on the president's nomination of
Willliam Lucas to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights
Division.
   Lucas' nomination was rejected last week by a 7-7 vote of the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
   ``The president asked me to bring the nomination to the floor
today for a vote. I refused his request, pointing out this is the
last day of the session and the Senate was working hard to complete
action on the savings and loan bill and extension of the debt limit
_ both urgently requested by the president himself,'' Mitchell said
in a statement after a private meeting with the president.
   Mitchell also indicated he warned Bush in a letter not to seek
to re-appoint Lucas during the upcoming recess. Such ``recess
appointments,'' which expire at the end of the next Senate session,
are sometimes used as a method of temporarily bypassing the
confirmation process.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president
was concerned about the delay in his nominations.
   ``The president wanted to register his deep concern that these
were being held up for artificial reasons not related to the
candidates themselves,'' Fitzwater said.
   But Mitchell said that 186 of Bush's nominations had been
approved with ``several more'' scheduled to be confirmed soon.
   ``Several of those delayed were at the request of Republican
senators,'' Mitchell said. ``I assured the president we would
continue to move on his nominations as promptly as possible
consistent with careful review of their qualifications.''
   The White House and the Democratic-controlled Senate have been
wrangling for weeks over the backlog of Bush nominations not yet
acted on by the Senate.
   White House officials and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., have claimed that many of the nominations are being held up
for purely political purposes.
   Among those nominations caught in the logjam is Bush's selection
of Donald Gregg, who had been his national security adviser when he
was vice president, as ambassador to South Korea. Gregg's
nomination, politically controverisal because of Gregg's alleged
familiarity with the Reagan administration's Iran-Contra dealings,
was approved by committee, but has yet to receive a floor vote.
   Also on hold is a batch of nominations to top-level positions in
the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The agency is the
target of influence-peddling inquiries.
   Fitzwater claimed thta some of the nominations were being held
hostage to legislation sought by individual members, while ``in
some cases they (senators) want commitments on their own candidates
for other jobs.''
   ``Some cases, it appeared to be just political,'' Fitzwater
added.
   The White House and the Senate are also feuding over whether
Senate staff aides should be allowed to study confidential FBI
reports on Bush's nominees. The White House now only permits
senators to review this material.
   ``We feel very strongly that the privacy of individual nominees
is such that members of the staff should not be able to rummage
trough people's private backgrounds and resumes and FBI files and
we register a very strong protest against that idea,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``He feels very strongly that senators are elected to make these
kinds of judgments,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Infotechnology Executives Sued Over Stock Transactions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman and directors of Infotechnology
Inc., which controls United Press International, have been accused
in a civil lawsuit of making illegal stock transactions to ward off
possible takeover bids.
   Infotechnology said Friday that it had not yet reviewed the
complaint, but ``there was no basis whatsover for claims''
contained in a news release which announced the filing of the
lawsuit.
   The accusations were made Thursday in a lawsuit filed in
Delaware Chancery Court by Avacus Partners LP, which owns 7.8
percent of Infotechnology stock and indicated in March it might
launch a takeover bid.
   Avacus said Chairman Earl Brian engineered stock transactions
involving Infotechnology and two other companies it controls in an
effort to frustrate takeover interest in Infotechnology and
entrench current management.
   It said Infotechnology received inadequate consideration in the
deals, and that the transactions enabled Brian and his allies to
boost their interest in the company to 32 percent from 13 percent.
   In addition to Brian, the lawsuit named Infotechnologies' four
other directors as defendants.
   The lawsuit asked that the court rescind the stock transactions
in question and place Infotechnology under control of a receiver.
   ``Infotech is confident that the lawsuit is entirely without
merit,'' Friday's statement read.
   The lawsuit stated that Infotechnology agreed in late February
to issue 1.5 million shares of its common stock valued at $16.15
million in exchange for the stock of WNW Group Inc., a privately
held company set up and managed by Brian.
   WNW's main assets are the right to control UPI wire service,
which has not been profitable in the last decade and continues to
report losses since emerging from bankruptcy law protection in 1986.
   Avacus said Brian had obtained those assets for WNW a year
earlier for $110,000, and noted that Infotechnology paid 150 times
the price he paid the previous year.
   The lawsuit also said Brian had Infotech provide unspecified
millions of dollars in loans to underwrite UPI's losses in 1988 and
1989.
   Avacus Partners is based in Washington and consists of several
limited partners, the largest of which is the Dutch investment firm
Reiss &amp; Co.

<TEXT>
   An alleged cocaine dealer and two former
bodyguards to Hustler publisher Larry Flynt pleaded innocent Friday
to the murder of theatrical producer Roy Radin in a dispute over
``The Cotton Club'' movie.
   The prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty against one
or more of the defendants at their upcoming trial.
   Karen DeLayne ``Lanie'' Greenberger, who is accused of ordering
Radin's killing in 1983, answered,``Not guilty,'' in a soft voice
and said she denied special circumstance allegations that the
killing was for financial gain and committed during a kidnapping.
   Co-defendants William Molony Mentzer and Alex LaMota Marti
pleaded innocent in the Radin murder as well.
   Deputy District Attorney David Conn said outside court: ``I can
say we will be seeking the death penalty on one or more defendants.
As to which defendants has not been determined at this time.''
   Radin, an obese, cocaine sniffing producer who was collaborating
with Hollywood movie mogul Robert Evans on finances for ``The
Cotton Club,'' disappeared on May 13, 1983. He was last seen
stepping into a limousine with Mrs. Greenberger en route to a swank
Beverly Hills restaurant for a meeting.
   The case lay dormant nearly six years until Flynt's
brother-in-law and former chief of security, William Rider, came
forward and gave damaging evidence.
   He linked Mentzer and Marti, the former bodyguards, to the
slaying and said he was told that Evans and Mrs. Greenberger paid
for ``the hit.''
   Radin died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head. His body was
found in a dry riverbed 60 miles north of Los Angeles where Rider
said the Flynt bodyguards often held target practice.
   Mrs. Greenberger, a reputed cocaine dealer who was once Evans'
girlfriend, was ordered to stand trial along with Mentzer and Marti
after a four-month preliminary hearing which focused on Radin's
fast life in a drug infested circle of celebrities and shady
characters.
   Conn has alleged that Mrs. Greenberger hired Mentzer and Marti
as hit men because she saw Radin as an obstacle to her share of a
lucrative deal with Evans for money from ``The Cotton Club.''
   Evans refused to testify at the preliminary hearing on Fifth
Amendment grounds, but his lawyer has said he had nothing to do
with the Radin murder.
   Mentzer and Marti also pleaded innocent to charges in a second
murder of a prostitute, June Mincher, which is unrelated to the
Radin case.
   Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner ordered the defendants to
return to his court Aug. 11 for assignment to a trial judge. The
three, who are being held without bail, waived their right to a
speedy trial until 60 days after that hearing at which Conn said he
would announce which defendants will be the subject of his efforts
to gain death sentences.

<TEXT>
   Cuba has released its first report of the
evidence against high-ranking military officials who were executed
or imprisoned for dealing in drugs, the Mexican government news
agency said Friday.
   In a dispatch from Havana, the Notimex agency said the evidence
was published in a 480-page book called ``Case 1-89, the End of the
Cuban Connection.''
   It did not describe the contents. Although parts of the trials
and appeals were televised, the evidence was kept secret.
   ``Case 1-89'' includes court records and other materials from
the military trials that resulted in four executions and the
imprisonment of 10 officers, the report said.
   Cuba's government publishing company said the book was intended
to counter what it described as a U.S. disinformation campaign
linking the prosecutions to an alleged crackdown on political
dissidents, Notimex reported.
   Notimex quoted Felix Sautie, head of the publishing company, as
saying: ``The revelations were made so that the foreign reader can
interpret the facts with precise information about the legal
procedures followed in the military trial.''
   The scandal embarrassed President Fidel Castro, who had said for
years that U.S. accusations of drug trafficking by Cuban officials
were propaganda.
   Four officers, including a highly decorated general, were
executed for their roles in the ring, which the government said
also dealt in diamonds, furs, rare woods and other contraband.
   Several officials, including the interior minister, were
dismissed for failing to detect or prevent the smuggling.

<TEXT>
   A man identified by authorities as the
``supreme boss'' of the Naples-based Camorra crime organization has
been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, federal police
announced Friday.
   Marco Antonio Veronezzi, the head of federal police in Sao
Paulo, told reporters that Francesco Toscanino ``coordinated, from
Brazil, the Camorra's distribution of cocaine and heroin to Europe
and the United States.'' The Camorra in Naples, Italy, is similar
to the Mafia elsewhere.
   Veronezzi said Toscanino, 54, has been in Brazil since 1986 and
directed a drug smuggling network with branches in the United
States, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, France, Italy, Thailand and Canada.
   Working with information supplied by Italian authorities,
federal police determined that Toscanino had a luxurious house in
the city of Jundiai, 37 miles north of Sao Paulo, according to
Veronezzi.
   He said that in a search of the house police confiscated $41,000
in U.S. currency and Italian bank certificates worth the equivalent
of $350,000.
   On July 19, three Italian police agents arrived with documents
and photographs ``for the positive identification of Toscanino''
and the suspect was arrested Wednesday at his seaside residence in
Guaruja, 47 miles south of Sao Paulo, Veronezzi said.
   He said Toscanino claimed he was a real estate broker and denied
any knowledge of the Camorra.
   Italy has requested Toscanino's extradition but if convicted in
Brazil he might have to serve up to 10 years in prison before he
could be sent back to Italy.
   Toscanino has been charged here with illegal entry and the use
of false documents along with drug trafficking. He is being held in
a cell at federal police headquarters in Sao Paulo.
   Veronezzi said Toscanino was arrested in Brazil in 1973 and
extradited to the United States where he was convicted of drug
trafficking and served 11 years of a 20-year sentence.
   Toscanino re-entered Brazil illegally in 1986 and began
``commanding the Camorro's drug distribution network from his
mansion in Jundiai,'' Veronezzi said.
   He told reporters he did not know why Toscanino decided to
establish his headquarters in Brazil.

<HEAD>Rebels Kill Guard On Peruvian Train; Mother Teresa Asks For Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven gunmen believed to be Shining Path
guerrillas mingled with passengers boarding a train and killed a
police guard after the train was under way, authorities said Friday.
   The attack occurred on Thursday, 155 miles east of the capital
city of Lima on the rail line that connects Lima with the Andean
city of Huancavelica, according to the government newspaper La
Cronica.
   Since 1980, Peru has been bled by the leftist insurgency of the
Mao-inspired Shining Path. The government says more than 15,000
people have died in the fighting.
   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who is in Lima
attending a religious conference on poverty and violence, pleaded
with people to forgive and pray for those who take up arms ``that
they realize their profound error and the injury they cause
others.''
   ``Begin with forgiveness, because when you forgive there is
peace, love and happiness,'' she told reporters at a news
conference Thursday.
   The report on the train attack said the seven rebels boarded the
train in Huancavelica, concealing their weapons and mixing with the
passengers. When the train entered a tunnel 15 miles from Huancayo,
the seven went to the first car of the train and shot the guard,
identified as Victor Serpa, sergeant in Peru's security police
force.
   They then went to the locomotive and forced the engineer to stop
the train. They tied up the engineer and fled into the countryside,
the report said.
   Peru's Central Railroad line is the world's highest normal gauge
railroad, rising to more than 13,000 feet from Lima on the coast.
It is a popular scenic route with tourists. It also is an important
link between Lima and the rich farming and mining areas of the
sierra. The Shining Path frequently targets the line as part of its
strategy to cut the capital off from the rest of Peru.
   Two weeks ago the rebels dynamited the tracks under a train
carrying copper ore, derailing all 18 cars.
   The Shining Path began its insurgency near Ayacucho, 235 miles
southeast of Lima. The violence has spread through most of the
Andean highlands, parts of the Pacific coastline and into the
coca-producing jungles of the northeast.

<HEAD>Girls With Rare Blood Disease Lose Chance For Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG TUCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twin girls suffering from a rare blood
disease lost a chance at the transplants they desperately need when
their insurance company went bankrupt, and their family is
struggling to raise money for the surgery.
   If the $60,000 needed for bone marrow transplants can't be
raised in a few weeks, 5-year-old Anna Marie and Mary Beth Heinz
will be hooked up to transfusion needles eight hours a day, five
days a week, said their uncle, Andy Willoughby.
   ``These kids have gone through so much already,'' Willoughby
said Friday.
   The girls, who suffer from congenital anemia and cannot produce
enough red blood cells, have already undergone 72 transfusions,
which are causing spleen and liver damage.
   The twins' older brother and sister have tissues that match
perfectly with their sisters', and an operation was set for July 5
at the University of Nebraska Medical Center at Omaha.
   But on July 3, the family's insurance company, Amalgamated Labor
Life Insurance Co., went bankrupt. The hospital would not admit the
twins without insurance.
   ``They urgently need to have something done,'' said the twins'
doctor, who asked that her name not be used.
   The girls' father, Dan Heinz, had lost his job as a meat cutter,
and was working two jobs _ delivering newspapers and hauling trash
_ to pay insurance premiums.
   ``Last winter he went into the country and chopped wood to save
money on heating bills,'' Willoughby said. ``Basically, he's been
working 16-hour days for five years. In all that time, I don't
think he's taken more than five days off.''
   After Amalgamated Labor Life went bankrupt, the Missouri Life
and Health Insurance Guaranty Association said it would provide up
to $100,000 for each girl's operation.
   The medical center said it would admit the girls and begin the
operation, but only if it was guaranteed payment of $130,000 per
child.
   The insurance money is available only through September, meaning
the family will have to raise the $60,000 and have the transplants
performed before the end of next month.
   The family has raised about $23,000 by Thursday, Willoughby said.
   ``The real time pressure is that we need to get the girls in the
hospital immediately,'' he said. ``If the transplants are
successful, then the girls will be able to manufacture their own
red blood cells, and they should have a healthy, normal life ahead
of them.''
   The cost of the transplants will go far beyond $130,000 per
child, Willoughby said.
   ``Dan said the other day that he knows he is financially ruined
no matter what happens,'' Willoughby said. ``He told me, `I'm done
for the rest of my life. It would be like paying for a car or a
house as long as you live. But it would be worth it.'''

   Soviet and Hungarian draftees plan
to set up a trade union within the military and asked the Dutch
Conscript Association for guidance, the founder of the Dutch union,
Loebas Oosterbeek, said Friday.
   Oosterbeek said Soviet and Hungarian delegations met with his
union on the fringes of last week's European Conference of
Conscript Organizations in Helsinki, Finland, which they were
attending for the first time.
   Founded in 1966, the Dutch group is the oldest of its kind in
Europe. It won Dutch soldiers the right to wear long hair, go home
after hours and work a 38-hour week.
   According to Oosterbeek, the East bloc delegates asked Dutch
union officials dozens of questions about how they ran their
organization, which he said has served as an example for several
draftees' groups in Europe.
   The delegates plans were afoot to set up similar unions of their
own in line with the political and economic reforms initiated by
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Oosterbeek said.
   The Soviet delegation at Helsinki consisted of a 19-year-old
conscripted army sergeant; a 21-year-old cadet of the Frunze
Military Academy in Moscow, and an official of the state-controlled
Committee for the Defense of Peace who Osterbeek said was sent
along as a security agent.
   Two army privates represented Hungary, and Osterbeek quoted them
as saying that Hungary will form a conscript organization within a
year.
   There was no immediate word whether the new draftees' unions
would have official status.
   According to the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies, the Soviet Union's armed forces amount to 5.1
million soldiers on active duty and 6.2 million reservists, but
there are no estimates on how many of those are conscripts serving
a two-year stint.
   The Netherlands' 45,000 draftees serve from 16 to 18 months, and
their union claims a membership of 14,000.

<HEAD>Justice Minister's Resignation Demanded After Inmates Die</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main opposition party and a human
rights group called Friday for the justice minister to resign
because of the deaths of two leftist prison inmates on a hunger
strike.
   Social Democrat Populist Party spokesman Cevdet Selvi said
Justice Minister Oltan Sungurlu was responsible for the deaths of
the two inmates, who had been on a hunger strike for 35 days.
   The inmates died Wednesday after they were transfered along with
310 other prisoners from Eskisehir Province to a prison in Aydin,
about 300 miles to the west.
   Prosecutors said the inmates, Mehmet Yalcinkaya and Huseyin
Husnu Eroglu, died of dehydration.
   The inmates were among 280 prisoners who began a hunger strike
at Eskisehir prison June 28 to protest restrictions imposed by
authorities following the discovery of an escape attempt.
   The hunger strikers claimed they were not fed sufficient meals
and were not allowed to go outside for air.
   Sungurlu told reporters Friday that the ``hunger strike was a
political action and the fasting prisoners refused any kind of
medical help.''
   The independent Human Rights Association said Friday that
Sungurlu should resign and should also face prosecution for what it
called his ``irresponsible attitude toward the problem.''
   Authorities said the transfer of prisoners from Eskisehir was
necessary so that workers could repair the damage to the prison
caused by the digging of two escape tunnels.
   Yalcinkaya, 28, had been sentenced to death for being a member
of the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party. Eroglu, 31, was on trial on
charges of being a member of the same party.
   A wave of political terrorism, pitting members of a dozen
military leftist groups against extreme rightists, claimed 5,000
lives in Turkey prior to the military takeover at the end of last
decade.
   According to statistics complied by the Human Rights
Association, 1,542 terrorist suspects are still in prison and still
on trial and 1,357 are serving sentences.

<HEAD>Guests for Murder Mystery Weekend End Up Crime Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mystery fans expecting to help solve a mock
murder at a seacoast restaurant this weekend now have to untangle a
real crime: who took the money that was supposed to pay for the
weekend fun.
   A woman posing as the organizer of the mystery weekend put out a
brochure advertising the fake murder and got people to pay up to
$500 for rooms, meals and the staged mystery, the attorney
general's office says.
   Luka's Greenhouse Restaurant in Hampton Falls never scheduled
the event because the woman failed to make a down payment on a
room, said Attorney General John Arnold. He is urging people who
paid for the weekend to notify his office.
   Mock murders are a relatively recent phenomenon. People pay
hundreds of dollars to take a cruise, stay at a hotel or ride a
train where a fake crime takes place. They are given certain clues
by the mystery organizers and then have to solve the puzzle,
usually a murder, using only the clues and their ingenuity.
   The management at Luka's is trying to come up with some clues to
the whereabouts of ``Maria,'' who told the restaurant she wanted to
rent a room for a murder mystery.
   Tracy Foster-Hill, functions sales manager at Luka's, said she
talked to the woman several times.
   The woman never gave her last name, Foster-Hill said, but left a
telephone number for a Beverly, Mass., residence. She said Maria
was told she would have to send in a deposit before the room could
be reserved for her, and she never did.
   ``I called her a few times and told her we had to have the money
before we could give her a room,'' Foster-Hill said. ``She kept
saying she wouldn't send any money until we sent her a menu so she
could see our food selection. We sent her at least four menus but
never got any money.''
   Foster-Hill said the last time she called the Beverly number,
about three weeks ago, the line was disconnected.
   Assistant Attorney General Donald Feith said he has talked to
three people, all from out of state, who mailed checks to a post
office box in Plaistow and received confirmation letters for the
mystery weekend.
   Feith said the Plaistow Post Office has told him no one has been
checking the box lately and that, when it was opened by
authorities, it was empty.
   Feith said the people he has spoken with don't seem to realize
that the mystery weekend is off and won't be held at a later date.
   ``Our fear is that Luka's will be visited by a number of people
this weekend expecting to see some kind of show,'' Feith said. ``We
expect to be pretty busy with calls from the people on Monday or
Tuesday.''
   Foster-Hill said a man called Luka's last week to find out where
he was staying for the weekend and was told there would be no mock
murder.
   ``He wasn't too happy,'' Foster-Hill said.
   Foster-Hill also said she was contacted recently by a hotel in
Gloucester, Mass., that had paid $600 to advertise in Maria's
mystery brochure.

   A judge refused Friday to let state police
exhume a teen-age boy's body in their search for the source of six
toes found preserved in the home of a man apparently obsessed with
feet.
   ``So many people would like to know what happened,'' said
Jefferson County District Attorney A. Ted Hudock.
   State police found two big toes, two middle toes and two little
toes in a glass jar when they searched the mobile home where farm
worker John Reed, 57, lived alone outside Brookville, nearly 40
miles north of this western Pennsylvania county seat, authorities
said.
   Trooper Franklin Duddy said Reed told him he cut one toe from
the body of Brian Joseph Pearce, 15, of Rossiter at a funeral home
in the Brookville area. The boy was killed in a 1985 hunting
accident, Duddy said.
   Reed wouldn't say where he got the other toes, Duddy told
Indiana County Common Pleas Court Judge Robert Earley at a
45-minute exhumation hearing.
   Duddy said police wanted permission to open the grave to
determine whether more than one toe was taken from the boy.
   Pearce's family objected. Earley said the most severe charge
police could file against Reed is mutilation of a corpse, a
second-degree misdemeanor with a two-year statute of limitations,
which has passed.
   Police said they were led to Reed by a neighbor who told them
Reed proposed that the two of them pick up an unidentified
17-year-old girl, have sex with her, kill her and mutilate her body.
   Hudock said the neighbor introduced Reed to an undercover state
trooper posing as a professional killer. Duddy said he arrested
Reed on July 16, when he joined the undercover officer in a barn
where Reed allegedly expected the girl's slaying to occur.
   Reed was being held in the Jefferson County Jail in lieu of
$100,000 bond on charges of conspiracy to commit homicide, criminal
solicitation and attempted homicide, Hudock said.
   Troopers found the toes in a glass jar hidden in a basket of
wild nuts, Duddy said.
   Allegheny County Coroner's Office officials said they were
unable to determine whether the toes came from the same body.
   The search of Reed's home yielded numerous photographs of
people's feet and films of marchers in parades with the camera
zooming in on the marchers' legs and feet, Hudock said. Police said
they could not tell who took the pictures.
   One photograph showed an unidentified barefoot boy ``lying in
high grass'' with his bare feet above the grass, Duddy said.
Another showed the bare feet of a ``tall, thin man'' standing in
dirt with his shoes on the ground beside him, Duddy said.
   Duddy told Earley that police wanted to know if any harm came to
those in the photographs.
   Police said they also found 65 memorial cards from Jefferson and
Armstrong county funeral homes. Hudock said he suspected Reed
attended dozens of funerals of people he did not know.
   The prosecutor said Reed is not a suspect in any homicide and
has no psychiatric history or criminal record.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
government ordered schools closed Friday after government
plainclothesmen fired on demonstrators at the national university,
killing one student and wounding at least six.
   An Education Ministry statement said public and private schools
were being closed nationwide ``until further notice ... for the
safety of students, to preserve the peace of mind of their families
and peace throughout the community in general.''
   The order did not affect the University of Panama, but it
announced earlier it was closing down its campus to protest the
Thursday night shootings.
   University officials in a statement Friday accused Panama's
Defense Forces of acting ``brutally against unarmed students'' and
for ``the excessive and indiscriminate use of toxic gases and
shotguns.''
   In a veiled reference to foes of Noriega who have been pressing
for his ouster, the Education Ministry statement accused ``those
who have been advocating violence and confrontations among
Panamanians'' of encouraging the students to demonstrate.
   An estimated 700,000 students were left without classes. About
half of them were in Panama City and the port of Colon, located
across the isthmus at the northern entrance of the Panama Canal.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said plainclothes
members of the Defense Forces fired shotguns at a student protest.
   Demonstrators were protesting an Organization of American States
proposal to end Panama's political turmoil by holding a plebiscite
Aug. 20.
   The students and opposition parties insist that elections May 7,
which their candidate Guillermo Endara won overwhelmingly, should
be declared valid. The Noriega-controlled government annulled the
elections, claiming fraud.
   Noriega runs Panama through his command of the Defense Forces,
which include both soldiers and police.
   Student leaders said in a news release that Ecuador's foreign
minister, Diego Cordovez, ``was not welcome any more'' in Panama
because of the plebiscite proposal. Cordovez heads an OAS mission
of diplomats trying to mediate here.
   In July, the Washington-based OAS voted to give Cordova's
mission until Sept. 1 to mediate a solution.
   The United States has tried to oust Noriega since he was
indicted in February 1988 on U.S. drug trafficking charges, but
trade and economic sanctions have failed to budge the general.
   Noriega denies the charges and says the United States is
attacking him as part of a plan to abrogate the Panama Canal
treaties, which call for the canal to be turned over to Panama at
the end of the century.
   Early Friday, about 200 U.S. soldiers stationed at the canal
staged the latest of a series of military shows of strength.
   The Southern Command said the five-hour exercise involved
combat-equipped soldiers, backed by helicopters and armored
vehicles, established ``blocking positions'' at Fort Amador, which
the United States shares with the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   The positions were established at the intersections near the
Amador Officers Club and the Golf Club, the command said _ only a
block or so from Noriega's Fort Amador office.

<TEXT>
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran said
Friday a reasonable solution existed to the hostage crisis and he
was willing to help the United States find it. Algeria later
reported progress in hostage talks in Beirut.
   ``I tell the White House the problem of Lebanon has solutions,
the freeing of the hostages has solutions _ reasonable, prudent
solutions,'' Rafsanjani said in his sermon in Tehran at weekly
Moslem prayers.
   Official Algiers Radio said Saturday that progress was made in
talks on Friday in which Algeria's ambassador in Beirut, Khaled
Hasnawi, was involved.
   It said Hasnawi met with the spiritual leader of Hezbollah,
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, and with U.N. envoy Marrack
Goulding in talks involving all hostages, whether ``Lebanese,
Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis.''
   ``Progress in this mediation was accomplished Friday,'' the
official state radio said, without elaborating.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said she
was aware of the report from Algeria but added, ``I have nothing
specific on that.''
   Algeria, while proud of its role in mediating past crises,
including the January 1981 release of American hostages held in the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran, usually is close-mouthed about its
involvement until an issue is settled. The radio report was seen as
a sign that Algerian authorities think a deal is close.
   Goulding met with Hasnawi for 30 minutes in Beirut, and said he
sought Algeria's help in determining the fate of Lt. Col. William
R. Higgins.
   Higgins, a U.S. Marine, was kidnapped on U.N. duty in February
1988. His captors said they hanged him Monday in retaliation for
Israel's abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric.
   A videotape was released, showing a man on a gallows who
appeared to be Higgins, but no body has been found. Some reports
said he was killed months ago.
   In the streets of Beirut, pro-Iranian Shiite zealots of
Hezbollah, the group believed to hold the Western hostages, paraded
to denounce the United States. At weekly prayers before the
demonstration, Fadlallah urged those holding the hostages not to
harm them.
   President Bush said he would explore Rafsanjani's offer ``to the
fullest,'' but added: ``I don't want to raise hopes beyond
fulfillment.''
   The International Committee of the Red Cross expressed
willingness to relay to Israel the demands for a prisoner release
made Thursday by the kidnappers of American hostage Joseph Cicippio
when they suspended plans to kill him.
   A knowledgeable Shiite source in Beirut, speaking privately,
said the final word on Cicippio's reprieve came from Rafsanjani,
who ``must have used his first day in office to pressure the
kidnappers to spare Cicippio's life.''
   Rafsanjani, who was inaugurated Thursday, is believed eager to
improve ties with the West and erase Iran's image as a sponsor of
international terrorism. In his sermon, he sought a conciliatory
tone with the United States.
   ``These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not
solve the problems. Come, let us approach the problem reasonably;
we too will help solv the problems there, so the people of the
region can live in peace and harmony,'' he said in the sermon,
broadcast by Tehran radio.
   Rafsanjani said that if the United States wants hostages freed,
it must ask Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the statements
``encouraging'' but said the hostage situation was ``a serious
problem'' and he did not expect changes in the increased deployment
of U.S. Navy forces in the Mediterranean.
   Israel sent commandos to southern Lebanon on July 28 to abduct
Obeid, a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God. Israel
offered to trade Obeid and other Shiite prisoners for three Israeli
soldiers held in Lebanon and for the Western hostages.
   Rafsanjani said about the Higgins killing: ``We do not make any
judgment about the group that executed the American colonel. You
cannot condemn the innocent people of Lebanon ... on the vague
basis that some group has possibly killed someone (Higgins) for a
crime.''
   If America responds by saying it cannot pressure Israel into
freeing Obeid, ``this isn't acceptable to us,'' Rafsanjani said.
   Sixteen Westerners are captives in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was seized March 16,
1985.
   In south Beirut, Fadlallah said those holding the hostages
should not harm them.
   ``Let's be better than they'' he said of what Hezbollah and Iran
call ``the arrogant powers.''
   ``Let's be loftier. Let's be more humanitarian. What we want is
for those detained people not to be hurt.''
   The demonstration after his sermon was to protest Obeid's
abduction. Men with beards and women in ankle-length black chadors
carried banners reading ``Death to America, the mother of all
terrorism.''
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, one of the kidnapping
groups believed to be fronts for Hezbollah, said Thursday it was
suspending its death sentence against Cicippio and replacing it
with demands that Israel free Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners.
It said it would provide a list to the Red Cross.
   Michel Dufour, chief Red Cross delegate in Lebanon, said:
``We've taken notice that our services may be needed, and if a
party approaches us to transmit messages, we'll do it.''
   Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham, said in Beirut that her heart,
``which was full of despair, sadness and pain for several years,
has regained some hope and was refreshed by this encouraging
humanitarian initiative.''
   In his hometown of Norristown, Pa., the hostage's relatives
decorated a sign proclaiming the number of his days in captivity
with a dozen balloons and an American flag. Cicippio was kidnapped
Sept. 12, 1986.
   In Jerusalem, Israel's top leaders conferred about a response to
the demands, which Revolutionary Justice said must be accepted
``within days.'' It did not say what would happen to Cicippio if
Israel refused.
   In addition to Algeria's aid, Turkey announced Friday it had
been in touch with all sides.

<HEAD>Christian Science Couple Found Innocent on Involuntary Manslaughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christian Science couple were
acquitted Friday of involuntary manslaughter but convicted of child
endangerment for relying on prayer instead of medical treatment for
their dying infant daughter.
   Mark Rippberger, 35, and Susan Middleton, 39, members of the
Church of Christ, Scientist, face up to four years state in prison
for the 1984 meningitis death of their 8-month-old daughter Natalie
Susan.
   Sentencing is set for Oct. 12.
   Rippberger and Middleton belong to a church founded by visionary
Mary Baker Eddy, who believed disease is a physical manifestation
of ``errors of the mind.''
   ``The jury showed remarkable intelligence in handing down this
verdict,'' said prosecutor David Dunn outside court. The family's
attorney, David Mackenroth of Sacramento, said he will appeal.
   During the seven-week trial before Sonoma County Superior Court
Judge Lloyd von der Mehden, the president of the American Academy
of Pediatrics testified that there is a 95 percent survival rate
when the infection is treated by a drug called defuroxime.
   The 12-member jury began deliberating the case Wednesday.
   Rippberger and Middleton were charged with two felonies,
involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment. Mackenroth
contended the couple were guilty only of following their religious
beliefs in seeking a cure through spiritual healing.
   Dunn said the couple may have acted correctly according to the
tenets of their religion, but their actions must be evaluated
against the standards of conduct established by law, that of an
``ordinarily prudent, careful person.''

   Congress could make the Supreme Court's job
easier by writing laws clearly, eliminating the need for
time-consuming court interpretations, Justice Byron R. White said
in a speech Friday.
   In the speech prepared for delivery at the American Bar
Association's convention, White said fellow Justice Antonin Scalia
has revived the debate over statutory language vs. legislative
history.
   In the past 50 years, courts trying to determine congressional
intent have looked at the legislative history of laws as well as
the wording of the statutes, White said.
   Such history includes committee hearings and reports, floor
debates and conference committee actions.
   White said a nearly 100-year-old high court decision _ Holy
Trinity Church vs. United States _ which allowed the interpretation
of even a clear statute based on legislative history, ``barely''
survived the Supreme Court's last session.
   In their interpretations, the courts begin with the statutory
language, which if thought clearly to relect legislative intent, is
followed, he said.
   However, ``most statutory cases involve not plain, but ambiguous
language, and in these cases resort to legislative history has been
the usual course,'' White said. ``This is often a very large
undertaking, taking hours and hours of effort by judges, law
clerks, and librarians, to say nothing of the time lawyers spend
and charge for seeking to present the materials that the judiciary
has indicated are relevant to decision.''
   With the ever-increasing complexity of subjects considered by
courts, more people, including Scalia, advocate a return to
interpreting statutes based almost wholly on the legislation's
text, White said.
   ``The statute as it is written, it is said, is what Congress
enacted, not statements in hearings, not discussion of statutory
terms contained in committee reports, and not statements on the
floor,'' said White, who was appointed to the court by President
Kennedy in 1962.
   White said Scalia, Reagan appointee, would confine the review of
legislative history to cases where the statuatory language itself
``produces an absurdity.''
   The debate over how statutes should be interpreted ``is
extremely important since it involves how the courts may best carry
out the will of Congress,'' White said, adding that in some cases
Congress may be vague on purpose, to force court decisions.
   White mentioned several other areas where Congress, as the major
source of changes in federal law, could ``simplify our work and at
the same time make its intent known..''
   _ When enacting laws, Congress should include a statute of
limitations, he said.
   _ Congress sometimes creates what seems to be a right, but fails
to provide a remedy, creating a recurring legal issue over whether
the seeming beneficiary of the right has a private remedy in
federal court, he said.
   _ Regarding conflicts between federal and state laws, White said
Congress should make its intentions clear when it plans to
supersede state law.
   _ White said Congress should clarify ``obvious uncertainties''
over statutes mandating the payment of lawyers' fees by losing
defendants.
   More than 8,000 lawyers are attending the convention, which
continues through Wednesday. The dinner was sponsored by the
American Judicature Society.

   Senate debate over a routine spending bill was
halted temporarily Friday when conservatives tried using it to
restore Oliver North's $23,000 annual pension, forfeited after his
felony convictions in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The proposal, sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., would
exempt the former White House aide from a law denying retirement
pay to officials convicted of destroying government documents, one
of three felonies on which North was found guilty.
   Democrats, reluctant to force a vote on the controversial former
Marine lieutenant colonel, instead delayed consideration of the
spending bill which would provide $18.4 billion for the Treasury,
Postal Service and other agencies for fiscal 1990.
   Senators returned to the spending bill, passing it by voice
vote, only after Senate leaders promised Helms that he would be
allowed action on a separate bill on North after the summer recess
but before Nov. 3.
   Helms complained that the government spent $40 million ``not
only to prosecute but to persecute'' North. He cited North's
service in Vietnam, where he won a Bronze Star, a Silver Star and
two Purple Hearts.
   ``A lot of the pygmies who criticize Oliver North never saw a
day when they were willing to lay down their lives for the
country,'' Helms said.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., countered that North was not
only a Vietnam hero but a convicted felon.
   ``Colonel North is no different than any other citizen,'' said
DeConcini. ``If you're found guilty, you have a right to appeal. If
you're found guilty, you lose certain benefits.''
   The debate eventually pitted a pair of Senate veterans of the
Vietnam War against each other.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who lost a portion of his leg in
Vietnam, argued that it is wrong for lawmakers to seek exceptions
for otherwise deserving individuals who fail to qualify for
government benefits. He cited a constituent who lost parts of both
legs in Vietnam but who failed to qualify for certain government
payments because the amputations were not severe enough.
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a Navy fighter pilot who was a
prisoner of war in North Vietnam for 5{ years, countered, ``I'll
take up his case.''
   The Navy suspended North's pension when he was sentenced on July
5 by U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to perform 1,200
hours of community service and pay a $150,000 fine. He was given no
prison time.
   The Navy later reversed itself, arguing that North, a retiree,
should not be considered an officeholder under the terms of the
law. But on Monday, U.S. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher
rejected the Navy's argument.
   North was convicted May 4 on charges of giving false testimony
to Congress during the Iran-Contra hearings, accepting a security
fence for his home, and shredding classified documents. He is
appealing his convictions.
   The former lieutenant colonel has become a popular dinner
speaker, with reports saying he collects up to $25,000 for each
appearance.
   Earlier this week, Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, offered another
proposal to restore North's pension. Democrats watered it down to
instead require the Senate Judiciary Committee to study the
question and report by November.
   On Wednesday, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services
Committee, Bill Dickinson of Alabama, introduced a separate bill to
restore North's pension.

<HEAD>Cuba: Near Collision Between U.S. Spy Plane and Colombian Jetliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba said Friday that a U.S. spy plane nearly
collided with a Boeing 727 jetliner of Colombia's national airline,
according to Cuba's official news agency. U.S. and Colombian
aviation officials said they knew nothing about the purported
incident.
   Cuba's Civil Aviation Agency reported the pilot of the Colombian
jet told the aviation agency that on Wednesday he saw a
``silver-blue plane'' flying from east to west at the same altitude
as that of Avianca's Flight 63, the Prensa Latina dispatch said.
   The news agency reported the pilot said that if the other plane
had been flying at a greater speed a collision would have been
inevitable.
   The news agency said at the same time that the incident occurred
a U.S. RC-135 spy plane was flying over Cuba engaged in ``espionage
activities.''
   It reported the Avianca pilot filed complaints with air traffic
control authorities in Colombia, Cuba and Miami. The dispatch was
monitored in Mexico City.
   Arlene Salac, spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration's regional office in Atlanta, said it had not
received such a report and if one had been made with the Miami
control center the Atlanta office would have been notified.
   In Miami, airport officials and the local Avianca office said
they had not heard of such a report.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said in Washington that he had checked
with several FAA offices about the Cuban account and ``I can't find
anyone who knows about it.''
   Colombian civil aeronatic officials in Bogota said the only
information they had was a report from Havana carried in the local
newspapers.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Strippers' Age Discrimination Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge on Friday ruled against three
French Quarter strippers who are challenging a new city ordinance
that bars striptease dancing by those under 21.
   Shannon Arendt, Josette Barry and Laura Folks contend that the
city is unconstitutionally denying them employment because of their
age, and they sought an injunction against enforcing the ordinance.
   State District Judge George C. Connolly Jr. set an Aug. 9
hearing on the lawsuit. The women, who are over 18 but under 21,
said they ``chose their profession or occupation because they enjoy
being entertainers and dancing.''
   The law went into effect July 26. No arrests had been made as of
Friday, an assistant city attorney said.
   In their lawsuit filed Thursday, the women said the ordinance is
``based on a request and false representations of an entity which
is trying to impose its religious views and values on plaintiffs
and other citizens of New Orleans.''
   The City Council passed the ordinance last month after James
Kelly, director of Covenant House, which cares for runaways and the
homeless, charged that stripping could lead to prostitution and
drug use.
   Kelly said he had to compete with ``drug dealers and flesh
peddlers'' in trying to find jobs for young drifters. However, many
club operators say the job of striptease dancing gives young people
a haven from street life.
   Deputy City Attorney William D. Aaron Jr. said he believes the
ordinance is on solid legal ground.
   ``The law says you've got to be 21 to buy an alcoholic drink in
a bar,'' he said. ``It just seems inconsistent for (people under
21) to work in that environment when the obvious intent of the
(drinking age law) is not to have them in that environment in the
first place.''

<HEAD>Four Children Drown In Car Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WYANDOTTE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car in which four children drowned was
pulled from the Detroit River on Friday, as police waited to
interview the distraught parents about what caused the accident.
   The car carrying the family of six broke through a barrier and
plunged into the river about 9:30 p.m. Thursday in this Detroit
suburb.
   Susan Delisle, 32, and her husband, Lawrence, 28, escaped from
the car, but their four children were trapped inside, said police
Chief Edward Rothermal. He identified the victims as Brian, 8;
Melissa, 4; Kadie, 2, and Emily, 8 months.
   The parents were in stable condition Friday at Wyandotte General
Hospital, said Justine Kimbler, assistant director of nursing. The
family was from nearby Lincoln Park.
   The car was traveling at about 45 mph in a 25 mph zone when it
went out of control on a road that ended with a barricade at the
river, Rothermal said.
   He said the car smashed through the barricade and hit the water.
   Lawrence Delisle was questioned by police Thursday night, but
``was in shock and incoherent,'' Rothermal said.
   Susan Delisle said the family had left a restaurant with her
husband at the wheel when his leg cramped, and he lost control of
the car as it pulled out of the parking lot, said police Sgt.
Daniel Galeski.
   She tried to gain control of the car but could not, he said.
   Investigators planned to interview the parents over the weekend,
Deputy Chief Robert Schrader said Friday.
   After the car hit the water, the parents managed to climb out,
and passing boaters tossed life jackets to them.
   ``The man was so exhausted and the woman was hysterical,'' said
Rick Stoneburner, who said he and a companion threw the flotation
devices to the couple from their boat. ``She said, `I am not
leaving without my children. Save my children, they are
underwater.'''
   Police officers were at the scene almost immediately, Rothermal
said. One child was pulled out of the car within 15 minutes, and
all four were removed within an hour, he said.

<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry issued a terse statement
Saturday denying a Japanese news report that 84-year-old senior
leader Deng Xiaoping is seriously ill.
   ``The report is sheer fabrication with ulterior motives,'' the
statement said in full.
   The ministry rarely comments on news reports about major Chinese
leaders, particularly Deng, who repeatedly has been rumored ill,
dying or dead over the last few years. However, the latest report
came weeks after Deng purged his No. 2 man, Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, setting the stage for a power struggle after
his death.
   The report by Japan's Jiji Press quoted unidentified Chinese
sources as saying Deng's health deteriorated seriously a few days
ago and emergency medical personnel were sent to care for him at a
coastal resort east of Beijing.
   It quoted doctors as saying they were discussing whether Deng
was too ill to be moved to Beijing, where better medical facilities
are available.
   The report sent Hong Kong's stock market plunging 55.51 points.
   The only official comment Friday came from the Hong Kong office
of the official Xinhua News Agency, which called the report a mere
rumor.
   No signs emerged of special activity Friday night inside
Communist Party headquarters, Zhongnanhai, although lights burned
late into the night at the Great Hall of the People. Soldiers
stationed around Beijing to enforce martial law were not increased
in number.
   Deng was last seen in public on June 9, when national television
showed him meeting with top army officers and congratulating them
on having ended student pro-democracy protests in Beijing.
   The official Xinhua news agency has said nearly 100 soldiers and
police died on June 3-4 in quelling the protests and that thousands
were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were
injured. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said
the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   At that time, Deng spoke in a strong voice and appeared more
alert and healthy than he has for months. He is widely believed to
suffer from prostate problems, and over the past few years, there
have been periodic reports that he is seriously ill or dying.
   Chinese sources long have reported that he has little energy and
is able to work only a few hours each day.

   The Senate on Friday night approved an $18.4
billion spending bill including $200,000 to remodel the vice
president's official residence to accomodate the young family of
Dan Quayle.
   The appropriations bill for the Treasury, the Postal Service,
the Office of the President and other smaller agencies for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 was approved by voice vote after the
Senate put aside a controversial amendment to restore Oliver
North's military pension. That issue will be taken up as a separate
bill later this year.
   The House version of the spending bill, approved July 28, also
provides money for the renovations to the vice presidential mansion
_ work that the family had previously said would be done with
private funds.
   The money would go toward work on the third floor of the 19th
Century mansion on the Naval Observatory grounds in an exclusive
Washington neighborhood.
   The three Quayle children, ranging in age between 15 and 10,
live on that level. When President Bush lived in the home as vice
president, the third floor was used for Barbara Bush's office, a
maid's bedroom and for storage.
   The Quayles have raised $200,000 but intend to use it for
furnishings instead, according to Denise Balzano, aide to Quayle's
wife, Marilyn.
   The overall bill contains $5.5 billion for the Internal Revenue
Service, $300 million more than this year, and $1.3 billion for the
Customs Service, $100 million above 1989 spending. Both are
Treasury agencies.
   It also cuts $30 million out of Postal Service funds used to
allow charities and institutions to enjoy low mailing rates. The
provision is aimed at preventing credit card companies from joining
with charities to seek business, and thus taking advantage of
subsidized mail rates.
   Another part of the bill would suspend enforcement of a tax law
for one year that encourages companies to bestow health insurance
on low-level workers and discourages greater benefits for
high-level executives than for other employees. Business groups
have complained that the requirement is expensive and
time-consuming.
   Like all annual spending bills considered by Congress, the
Treasury measure is riddled with special projects for certain
lawmakers.
   Thus, it orders Treasury to transfer an aircraft it has seized
to the Arizona Health Sciences Center in Tucson, Ariz. The chairman
of the Senate Appropriations treasury subcommittee is Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   The Senate also eliminated money to keep a post office
functioning in Holly Springs, Miss.
   Holly Springs happens to be in the district of Rep. Jamie
Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
Rejecting the money for a project of interest to the other chamber
is a favorite tactic in Congress to enhance one's bargaining
position when a compromise bill is fashioned.
   The two chambers will have to work out compromise legislation
after Congress returns from its recess in September before sending
it to President Bush for his signature.

<HEAD>Weinberger Disputes MacFarlane Claim That Raids on Lebanon Were Considered</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hostages, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane's claim that military mismanagement thwarted two air
raids on radical Shiite Moslems in Lebanon in 1983 was challenged
Friday by former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   ``He's just as unreliable on this as he was on virtually
everything else I ever did with him,'' Weinberger said in an
interview with television station WCVB-TV.
   In an interview shown Thursday on WCVB-TV's show ``Hostage,''
McFarlane said the United States came close to mounting bombing
raids twice in 1983 when government intelligence learned where the
Shiites were training.
   McFarlane said the missions were aborted because ``of our own
military chain of command.''
   In 1983, the truck bombing of a Marine barracks in Lebanon
claimed the lives of hundreds of U.S servicemen. McFarlane said the
United States had ``extremely good intelligence'' that Hezbollah
militiamen were training in barracks in a valley in eastern Lebanon.
   Most Western hostages in Lebanon are believed held by factions
of Hezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed fundamentailst
Shiite group.
   In the first attempt, U.S. pilots circled so long over the area
that Syrian air defenses could have been able to ``turn on, track
them, shoot them down,'' McFarlane said.
   McFarlane blamed the delay on ``inept mismanagement'' by the
pilots' superiors.
   McFarlane said Weinberger called off the second raid, which had
been planned with the French government, because the defense
secretary felt it was too risky.
   Weinberger's decision resulted in ``great damage to our
credibility and put an end to any hopes of dealing with these
terrorists,'' the former national security adviser said.
   Weinberger strongly denied the allegation.
   ``There were certainly no planes in the air about to make a
strike that were turned back, and there was most certainly no
failure to cooperate,'' Weinberger said. ``Those are just plain
myths.''
   McFarlane was unavailable for further comment Friday, McFarlane
spokeswoman Cindy Carpenter said in Washington. ``He said he really
had nothing more to say on the subject,'' she said.
   McFarlane said Thursday there was never an effort planned to
rescue the hostages because officials never had intelligence on
where they were.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty last year to four misdemeanor counts of
withholding information from Congress about Reagan administration
efforts to funnel military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. He
left his National Security Council post in November 1985, but
remained active in policymaking, leading an unsuccessul
arms-for-hostages mission to Tehran in 1986.
   He attempted suicide in 1987 after the Iran-Contra scandal
broke, but since has cooperated with prosecutors by testifying at
the Oliver North trial.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Extend Debt Limit to $2.87 Trillion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Friday night to temporarily
extend the government's debt limit by $70 billion to $2.87
trillion, granting it authority to borrow enough money to function
through the next three months.
   On a voice vote, the Senate gave final approval to the extension
and sent it to President Bush for his signature.
   Had the lawmakers not approved the measure before leaving for
their four-week summer recess, the government would have run out of
money during their vacation and toppled into an unprecedented
default.
   The bill, which the House had approved on Tuesday, provides
enough borrowing authority to see the government through Oct. 31.
On Nov. 1, the temporary authority would lapse and the legal limit
on the federal debt will lapse back to its current ceiling of $2.8
trillion.
   By that time, lawmakers hope to complete a long-range permanent
debt limit extension to more than $3.1 trillion, enough borrowing
for about a year.
   Many legislators hope the long-term extension will contain the
elements of a budget deal between Congress and the Bush
administration for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, 1990.
   Legislative leaders spent much of the last several weeks trying
to dissuade lawmakers from offering amendments to the debt limit
measure. The extension, considered must-pass legislation, is a
favorite target for members of Congress with bills that are too
controversial to pass if standing alone.
   The government needs legal authority to borrow money because it
runs a deficit every year, a shortfall that has hovered at around
$150 billion annually for the last three years. It gets the rest of
the money it needs each year by borrowing it.
   When the Reagan administration took office in 1981, the national
debt was just above $900 billion.

<HEAD>William Mellon, Oil Heir and Founder Of Hospital, Dies</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Dr. William Larimer Mellon Jr., 79,
an heir to the Mellon oil fortune and a Pennsylvania-born disciple
of the late philanthropist Albert Schweitzer, was buried Friday in
a small Haitian village near the hospital he founded 33 years ago,
a hospital spokesman said.
   Mellon died of kidney failure Thursday evening in Albert
Schweitzer Hospital in Deschapelles, 62 miles north of
Port-au-Prince, hospital spokesman Pierre Allen told The Associated
Press.
   Mellon, originally from Pittsburgh, founded the hospital in June
1956. It is the most modern medical facility in the fertile
Artibonite Valley region in central Haiti and has provided medical

   Allen said Mellon became a physician when in his 40s to follow
the example of Schweitzer, a musician, theologian and physician who
in 1913 founded a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon, in southwest
Africa, and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952.
   Allen said the government will produce and broadcast a memorial
film on Mellon on state-run Television Nationale d'Haiti.
   He said Mellon, born on June 26, 1910, was buried in the small
cemetery used for hospital personnel.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's gradual approach
to change in the Soviet Union may lead to economic or political
disaster, Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sakharov told
scholars at Harvard University.
   ``Waiting longer for the radicalization of perestroika is out of
the question,'' the 68-year-old physicist said Thursday at a
luncheon with Harvard officials and Soviet affairs specialists
hosted by Derek Bok, the university's president.
   ``If we allow this to go on, we are threatened with chaos,''
Sakharov said after giving a critical review of his country's
problems. ``We may be threatened with a military coup. We may be
threatened with famine.
   ``This state is now at a historic moment. It could tip left or
right. We have to find a way to hold our course.''
   Sakharov said the most immediate danger is the economy, and he
joked that ``a good way to tell whether someone is an optimist or a
pessimist'' is to ask whether he thinks economic disaster will
strike in ``one, two or five years.''
   The luncheon, also attended by Sakharov's wife, Elena Bonner,
was held at the residence of Harvard President Derek Bok. Sakharov
spoke through a translator.
   Ms. Bonner, who has also been a longtime critic of Soviet
policies, urged Western nations not to get carried away with
uncritical applause for Soviet reforms and not to stop pressing for
change.
   ``The Soviet people are overjoyed to find that, in fact, our
country is a living entity,'' she said, recalling the recent
Congress of People's Deputies, where open debates kept the nation
riveted to its television screens.
   ``The whole country was amazed and enthusiastic to see that we
are alive, that we haven't lost our reason because of the hunger,
the trials, the falsification that we've suffered,'' she said. ``If
only the West can keep itself from lousing things up.''
   Sakharov, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, was banished to
internal exile in the city of Gorky for seven years after
criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. He was released
in 1986 by Gorbachev and has since been allowed to speak out and
travel freely.
   He is a deputy in the new, 2,500-member congress and has emerged
as one of the leaders of an independent bloc of about 400 delegates
calling for speedier reforms aimed at democratizing the country and
decentralizing the economy.

   The armed forces said Friday it
broke up a ring of leftist rebels smuggling guns from Nicaragua
into El Salvador.
   It said it killed one guerrilla, captured five and confiscated
60 Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles in operations that began in
central Honduras on July 28.
   ``All the arms were new,'' spokesman Col. Manuel Suarez told a
news conference.
   He called the group ``a subversive cell of the FMLN'' and ``part
of the logistics system organized by the FMLN in Honduras over the
past eight years to obtain arms from Nicaragua.''
   The FMLN is the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
leftist rebel army that has been at war with a succession of
U.S.-backed governments in El Salvador since 1980.
   He said the gunrunners brought weapons in from Nicaragua at El
Codito, 155 miles east of Tegucigalpa in El Paraiso province on the
Nicaraguan border.
   Clandestine routes were used to transfer the arms into
Salvadoran refugee camps in Honduras and then across the border
into El Salvador, Suarez said.
   He said camps near Colomoncagua, where about 10,000 refugees
live, were often used by Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government
``to send arms to the FMLN.''
   Suarez identified the slain guerrilla as Manuel de Jesus Larin,
a 36-year-old Salvadoran who belonged to the Central American
Revolutionary Workers Party, a guerrilla group with members from
all over Central America.
   He said Larin died in a confrontation with soldiers July 28
while transporting arms to the FMLN. The AK-47s were found in
Larin's vehicle, he said.
   Suarez said two other Salvadorans and three Hondurans were
captured in subsequent operations.
   Nicaragua has long denied providing arms to the FMLN. It
describes its support for Salvadoran rebels as moral and logistical.
   The 9-year-old civil war in El Salvador has killed an estimated
70,000 people, mostly civilians.

<HEAD>Magazine: Rob Lowe Passed Out After Making Sex Tape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rob Lowe passed out after videotaping two young
women making love to each other, and the women took $200, a bottle
of pills and the tape from the actor's hotel room, according to
Rolling Stone magazine.
   The women began circulating copies of the tape the next day,
according to the article in Aug. 24 editions of the magazine.
   The article also said most segments of the tape shown on
television newscasts showed a Lowe sex escapade in Paris, not the
encounter with then-16-year-old Jan Parsons and her friend, Tara
Seburt, at a hotel here during the Democratic National Convention
last summer.
   The videotape consists of three segments, starting with an
episode with Lowe and a male and a female friend in Paris before he
went to Atlanta for the convention, Rolling Stone said.
   The second segment shows Lowe's visit to an Atlanta Braves
baseball game with California Assemblyman Tom Hayden and the third,
seven-minute section shows the hotel encounter on July 18, 1988.
   The movie star and Miss Parsons met at Club Rio, a downtown
dance club, Rolling Stone said.
   The magazine quoted the club's publicity director, Susan
Sullivan, as saying Miss Seburt called her the morning after the
tape was made to tell her about it.
   Ms. Sullivan said Miss Seburt told her she and Miss Parsons they
videotaped the encounter with Lowe and that when he passed out,
they left, taking $200 from his wallet, the pills and the tape,
Rolling Stone said.
   Miss Seburt wanted to know if the club could make copies of the
tape, Ms. Sullivan said.
   The club could not make copies, but the young women arranged
through a friend at a hair salon where they worked to have a video
freelancer make copies, Rolling Stone said.
   Two copies were available the day after the taping, and tapes
were soon circulating.
   Publicist Lisa Kasteler of PMK public relations in Los Angeles,
which represents Lowe, refused Friday to comment on the report that
the women were the source of copies of the tape or on the effect
the scandal has had on Lowe's career. Lowe is filming a movie
called ``Bad Influence.''
   Lowe declined to be interviewed for Rolling Stone's article, and
Kasteler would not provide his number. A telephone call Friday to
the home of his Atlanta attorney, Edgar Neely III, was not answered.
   Last week, Lowe agreed to perform 20 hours of community service
in Los Angeles over two years to avoid prosecution.
   Miss Parsons' mother, Lena Arlene Wilson Parsons, brought the
video encounter into the public eye in May when she filed a civil
lawsuit against Lowe, saying he seduced her then-minor daughter.
The lawsuit is pending.

<TEXT>
   Twenty Kenyans studying in China have staged a
sit-in at their embassy in Beijing, demanding plane tickets home
and higher stipends, the students said Friday.
   The Kenyans are the second group of African students in China to
invade their embassy this summer. About 40 Zairean students staged
a 10-day sit-in that ended last week, demanding payment of
thousands of dollars in overdue stipends.
   The Kenyans said they were not in touch with the Zaireans and
said their situations are not identical.
   The Kenyans want plane tickets home for three students who
graduated this year and one who withdrew, a substantial increase in
their living allowance and better communication between embassy and
students.
   They went to the embassy Monday morning to discuss their
complaints. They said they stayed on because their government
promised them nothing.
   They have camped out in the embassy library, sleeping on the
floor and sofas, and eating bread and milk.
   The students spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared
reprisals from their government.
   No one at the embassy was immediately available for comment, and
later calls were unanswered.

   The Coast Guard and Chevron on Friday
abandoned the search for six workers missing from a capsized rig in
the Gulf of Mexico on Friday.
   ``Chevron has exhausted all efforts for the search for the
missing people by divers,'' the oil company said in a statement.
Avis Bourg Co., which owns the rig, will salvage it and continue
the search for the workers, Chevron said.
   Avis Bourg officials did not return repeated telephone calls to
their office.
   The Coast Guard on Monday will open hearings into the accident
Monday which killed at least four men when the rig capsized Monday.
Four crewmen were rescued immediately after the accident.
   The lift boat, or ``jackup rig,'' with legs that can be moved up
while traveling or down while working, remains on its side in 30
feet of water. It overturned while heading for shore while
Hurricane Chantal approached.
   Divers for Chevron, which had contracted the rig and workers,
searched through Thursday night and recovered four bodies from the
rig.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A thunderstorm doused sections of northeastern
Illinois with up to 5 inches of rain Friday, flooding roads,
causing widespread power outages and forcing the evacuation of
hundreds of patients from a flooded hospital.
   Doctors, nurses and ambulance crews worked Friday night to
discharge or transfer to other hospitals about 300 patients from
Resurrection Medical Center, a 434-bed hospital on Chicago's
Northwest Side.
   The hospital's basement was flooded and the ground floor was
ankle-deep in water at one point, officials said. Patients had no
hot water or hot food because of the flooding.
   Firefighters were working to pump out water from the basement
and sub-basement, said hospital spokeswoman Janice Youngwith.
   More than 50,000 Commonwealth Edison customers lost electricity
at the storm's peak between 4 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., said utility
spokesman Mike Kelly. By early afternoon, all but 100 or 200 had
power back.
   ``We're down to just a mop-up operation,'' Kelly said.
   In the area near O'Hare International Airport, ``we got just
about our entire total normal monthly rainfall for August,'' in the
downpour, said Richard Koeneman, a forecaster with the National
Weather Service in Chicago.
   O'Hare got 3.45 inches of rain between 1:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.,
he said. The total normal rainfall for August in the area is 3.53
inches.
   Flash flood warings went up for northern Kane, Du Page and Cook
counties, as well as De Kalb County.
   The Edens Expressway was closed near Winnetka after 6 a.m. and
remained closed until about 10:30 a.m., frustrating commuters, said
Illinois Department of Transportation dispatchers.
   Public safety officers used an inflatable dinghy to rescue a man
who was stranded knee-deep in water on the top of his submerged car
on the expressway under an overpass in suburban Northfield, said
Paul Harlow, deputy chief of public safety in Glencoe.
   Power outages hit the northern suburbs the hardest, followed by
Chicago's north side and the western suburbs, said Commonwealth
Edison spokesman Jose Andrade.
   Crews in trucks were hampered by street flooding, he said.
   The heaviest part of the storm swept a 20-mile-wide band on a
line from Elgin through Arlington Heights to Evanston, Koeneman
said.
   Three to five inches of rain fell in the hardest-hit areas, he
said. But the rains hit a relatively small region, and ``people who
live to south are certainly probably wondering what all the
excitement is about.''

<HEAD>Police Review Gay Attack Evidence in Light of Victim's New Story</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lesbian minister who said she was the
victim of two anti-gay attacks last month changed her story when
police confronted her with evidence some of her injuries were
self-inflicted, authorities said Friday.
   Lynn Griffis, an assistant pastor at the Metropolitan Community
Church of San Francisco, resigned from her duties two hours after
being placed on administrative leave Thursday night, said Rev. Jim
Mitulski.
   ``As a church, we have a lot of compassion for Lynn, and
whatever the truth is, we want to know what the truth is,''
Mitulski said. Griffis has left town and he doesn't expect to hear
from her again, he said.
   Griffis said she was attacked first on July 12, hit on the head
with a shovel after surprising an assailant who broke into her
garage and scrawled anti-gay graffiti on the wall. She received
eight stitches.
   She later alleged that she was abducted July 27 in the
Haight-Ashbury area by two so-called ``skinheads'' who threw her
into a car, beat her up and threatened to kill her before releasing
her.
   Police Chief Frank Jordan said her account of the first attack
was consistent with the evidence, but the medical examiner said
physical evidence failed to match her account of a second attack.
   Jordan declined to detail the inconsistencies, but a source
close to the case told The Associated Press that Medical Examiner
Boyd Stephens determined the injuries she allegedly suffered from
the skinheads were self-inflicted.
   Jordan also said damage to Griffis' clothing and a subsequent
description of how her injuries were received were inconsistent
with the evidence or even her account. ``There was no attack as
described,'' he added.
   Stephens did not return telephone calls made Friday evening by
The AP.
   When police presented the inconsistent evidence to Griffis at a
meeting with members of the gay community on Thursday, Griffis
described a different series of events and said she had been
sexually assaulted, Jordan said.
   Police have referred the case to their sex crimes unit and will
reconsider all of the evidence, Jordan said.
   Griffis has worked at MCC for about 18 months, Mitulski said.
``She did good work with people with AIDS,'' he said. ``She helped
a lot of people. This doesn't change that ... I can't understand
why this would happen.''
   The church had received a written death threat against Griffis
and Mitulski the night before the first attack, and Mitulski said
he has received subsequent death threats over the phone.
   The alleged attacks, coupled with the recent defacing of a gay
man's home, prompted local gay leaders to organize self-defense and
gun-handling classes.
   Reports of inconsistencies in Griffis' case prompted fears among
gay advocates that subsequent reports would not be taken seriously
by officials or the public.
   Jordan and others said that regardless of the outcome of the
Griffis case, hate crimes will not be tolerated. He said police
receive about 10 reports of hate crimes per month, and that other
community organizations receive more.

<HEAD>Two `Great Train Robbery' Gangsters Jailed In Drug Case</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   LONDON (AP)_ Two men convicted 25 years ago in Britain's ``Great
Train Robbery'' case were back in prison Friday after pleading
guilty to drug-trafficking charges.
   Thomas Wisbey, 59, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and James
Hussey, 56, was given a 7-year sentence for drug dealing.
   Both men had been convicted of participating in the Great Train
Robbery of Aug. 8, 1963, when a gang of 15 men stole $7 million
from a mail train.
   ``You are both old enough and experienced enough to know exactly
what you were doing and your motive was greed in each case,
regardless of the welfare of your fellow citizens,'' Judge Roger
Sanders told the defendants at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east
London before sentencing them Friday.
   Hussey and Wisbey were each sentenced to 30 years in jail in
1964 for their part in the train robbery. Hussey was released in
December 1975 and Wisbey the following year.
   At a hearing in the drugs case police testified that they saw
the two men exchanging bags containing cocaine in a park.
   Detective Sgt. Martin Gill told the court police seized 5.3
pounds of drugs with a street value of more than $930,000.
   Sanders ordered confiscation of about $76,000 found by police at
two addresses and with Wisbey's wife Irene.
   Wisbey, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 10 years for
supplying 2.2 pounds of cocaine to Hussey. He also was sentenced to
10 years for possession of cocaine with intent to supply and three
months for possessing marijuana. The sentences are to run
concurrently.
   Hussey pleaded guilty of possessing 2.2 pounds of cocaine with
intent to supply.
   The Great Train Robbery was planned with military precision and
at the time was Britain's biggest robbery.
   Faking a railroad signal in the countryside northwest of London,
the gang stopped a mail train traveling from Glasgow to London.
   They broke into the mail van, overpowered the crew and stole
more than 120 bags full of used banknotes. Less than $980,000 was
recovered.
   All 15 members of the gang were caught. One, Ronald Biggs,
received a 30-year prison sentence, but escaped from London's
Wandsworth prison on July 8, 1965. He now lives in Brazil, immune
from extradition because of legal technicalities.

<TEXT>
   Half of Americans questioned in a poll
disapprove of Israel's kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric,
according to results released Friday.
   A similar proportion thought President Bush had been ``not tough
enough'' in handling the hostage crisis, according to the ABC
News-Washington Post poll of 711 adults on Wednesday and Thursday.
   Still, almost as many approved Bush's handling of the situation.
   The proportion considering Israel a ``reliable ally,'' or one
that can be trusted to cooperate with the United States ``in almost
any circumstances,'' fell to the lowest level in the eight years
that question had been asked, 29 percent.
   Forty-eight percent said Israel should return the kidnapped man
and 35 percent said he should not be returned. The rest had no
opinion.
   Thirty percent approved of the kidnapping in the first place and
51 percent disapproved.
   Fifty-one percent said Bush had not been tough enough, 35
percent said his reaction had been ``just about right'' and 1
percent said he had been too tough.
   When asked to approve or disapprove the president's handling of
the crisis, 47 percent approved and 35 percent disapproved.
   Forty-eight percent said Israel should return its captive and 35
percent said it should not.
   The proportion characterizing Israel as ``not reliable'' rose to
53 percent from 46 percent giving a similar response in April,
while those judging Israel reliable fell from 51 percent to 29
percent.
   Since 1981, the proportion applying the term ``reliable'' to
Israel had fluctuated from 40 percent to 64 percent. Those
returning a judgment of ``not reliable'' had ranged between 24
percent and 56 percent.
   In a sample of 711 people, the margin of error is 4.5 percentage
points either way, the poll said.

<HEAD>Senate Returns HUD Figure's Nomination to Administration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate returned three of President Bush's
nominations to the White House on Friday for him to reconsider _
including one whose name has cropped up in connection with the
influence-peddling scandal in the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Voting just before leaving for their August recess, senators
also approved several of the president's nominations to federal
posts and ambassadorships.
   Among those they returned was that of Fred Bush, no relation to
the president, who was nominated to be ambassador to Luxembourg.
   Fred Bush was a prominent fundraiser for President Reagan's 1984
re-election campaign and then-Vice President Bush's 1988 race who
has since worked as a consultant on housing projects.
   Fred Bush was paid $215,000 to help land HUD funds for
developers on a Puerto Rico project. He has testified before
congressional investigators, telling them he ``did not bring very
much'' to the project.
   Along with Fred Bush, the Senate returned to the president the
nominations of Diane Morales, who was nominated for assistant
secretary of energy for Environment, Safety and Health, and Vaughn
Walker, the president's choice for the U.S. District Court for for
the northern district of California. Walker has been criticized for
belonging to segregated clubs.
   The Senate action was not a formal rejection. The president can
submit the names again or find new nominations.
   The Senate approved John Betti, a former official with the Ford
Motor Company, as the new acquisitions chief at the Pentagon, and
Michael Stone as Secretary of the Army.
   Three Bush nominees for the Federal Communications Commission
were approved: Sherrie P. Marshall, Andrew C. Barrett, and Alfred
C. Sikes, who will become chairman.
   Richard Clarke and Raymond Seitz were approved as assistant
secretaries of state, and approval was given to new ambassadors to
Nepal, Ghana, Greece, Ireland, South Africa, and Norway.

   Bon Jovi will interrupt its tour for the album
``New Jersey'' to headline a ``heavy metal summit'' in Moscow.
   The first Moscow Music Peace Festival will be held Aug. 12 and
13 at the 140,000-seat Lenin Stadium.
   ``We've been out since Halloween,'' leader Jon Bon Jovi said by
telephone from Atlanta, where the group was performing. ``We're 150
shows into the tour. We plan on being out till March of next year.
We're the hardest working band in show business, self-proclaimed.
We typically do 225 shows a year.
   ``We come back from Moscow and do the States for a month, New
Zealand, Thailand, South America, Mexico. Anywhere they have
electricity, we'll play. If they don't have electricity, just tell
us in advance. We'll bring a real long extension cord.''
   Also on the Lenin Stadium bill are Ozzy Osbourne, Motley Crue,
Scorpions, Cinderella and Skid Row and, from the Soviet Union,
Gorky Park, CCCP and Nuance. The shows will be broadcast in 50
countries.
   The shows are benefits, not for peace as its name implies, but
for an educational approach to fighting drug and alcohol abuse in
the United States and Soviet Union. Ticket sale profits will be
divided between the Make a Difference Foundation of Raleigh, N.C.,
and similar organizations in the Soviet Union. The foundation uses
music and sports figures as role models to get its anti-substance
abuse message across.
   In America, the concert will be on pay-per-view TV for four
hours the evening of Aug. 13. Those in the 11.5 million U.S.
households equipped for pay-per-view can contact their cable
operator to find out how to order it. Westwood One will simulcast
the music.
   Make a Difference Foundation receives money from that TV
presentation _ the concert won't be broadcast on any other channel
for at least four months _ and from a Polygram recording.
   The record won't be live. Each group will record a song by a
star who died of substance abuse. Bon Jovi recorded ``The Boys Are
Back in Town,'' written by singer-songwriter-bassist Phil Lynnot of
Thin Lizzy, an Irish band.
   ``He was a big influence on my career,'' Bon Jovi said. ``That
was a wonderful band. That song was its only hit, in the mid-1970s.
The guy had problems with drugs and it killed him. They broke up
before he died.
   ``It's our first show for drug abuse. What started as a
snowflake has turned into an avalanche.''
   The band decided to do a concert somewhere for Make a Difference
Foundation. The somewhere came to be Moscow and the concert became
an East-West festival.
   ``A lot of people I've grown up with died of drugs or had
problems,'' Bon Jovi said. ``I was never seriously addicted. I
experimented and have since quit.''
   But he won't speak an anti-drug message. For one thing, he
doesn't know Russian. For another, ``I'm going there to offer
entertainment and an introduction to rock 'n' roll, not to be the
preacher.
   ``If my opinion is asked enough times, I'll give it. If I get up
in the morning and do a big line of cocaine I don't think it is
going to help me sing and write songs. I do not do drugs.
   ``I did those commercials `rockers against drugs.' I was among
the first guys who ever did one,'' he said.
   ``They wanted me to be a poster child. It is difficult for me to
be a role model. I'm not vain enough to think I'm perfect. All I
want to do is be a singer in a rock band.''
   Bon Jovi said the group will play ``The Boys Are Back in Town''
in Moscow but couldn't predict what else.
   ``Everybody is doing 45 minutes,'' he said. ``I figure each
concert will go on eight hours.'' He also has been asked to put
together a jam session with the other groups.
   ``Elvis isn't covered on the album and neither are the Rolling
Stones. I'll pull a couple of their songs everyone knows.'' (Rhythm
guitarist Brian Jones left the Rolling Stones in June 1969 and was
found dead three weeks later in his swimming pool, a victim of
barbiturates.)
   ``We're the last ones to go on,'' Bon Jovi said. ``I'll
introduce everyone and bring them on for the jam.''

<TEXT>
   For Stephanie Beacham, changing jobs this
coming season has meant a radical change of uniform.
   Instead of the designer clothes she wore as wealthy Sable Colby
on ABC's ``Dynasty,'' she'll don a nun's habit for the title role
in the new NBC sitcom ``Sister Kate.''
   ``That's very tiresome, having six costume fittings a week,''
she said. ``It's going to be heaven just being in a little
navy-blue skirt and white blouse, thank you very much. That's
wardrobe now.''
   Beacham, meeting with television critics who had gathered to
preview the new fall shows, said playing a nun is actually closer
to her own upbringing than was the role as the rich and flighty
Sable.
   ``Anybody who knows me knows it was more of a stretch for me to
do Sable in some ways than it will be for me to do Kate,'' Beacham
said.
   ``I'm a little Girl Guide: `Good, better, best, never let it
rest, till the good is better and the better, best.'''
   Beacham's ``Sister Kate'' is no sappy Singing Nun, nor is she
anything like the earnest, neophyte sister played by Sally Field in
television days of yore. Kate is a no-nonsense house mother to a
pack of often trying orphans.
   Beacham said she met some activist nuns who help the homeless
and she hopes to use them as role models. ``I will be talking to
them a lot, because they're very keen that nuns don't seem wimpy. I
think they're sick and tired of singing nuns and soppy nuns. These
women are dedicated to improving everybody's lives, and also to not
being seen as straight and boring and tiresome. They want to help,
and they want to have fun.''
   Beacham said she also draws from childhood experience for the
characterization of tough Sister Kate, having been sent to a
convent school when she was a young child in England. ``My early
education was my nuns,'' she said. ``And I love them, I love the
nuns that brought me up, and I was very frightened of them. And I
look forward to the idea of being as frightening as Sister Mary
Cyrill was to me.''
   Beacham said her upbringing stuck with her and now forms a back
story for Sister Kate, including deviations such as posing for
photographs that turned up later in Playboy magazine. ``I think
those nuns getting at me at 4{ was very, very important,'' she
said. ``I think I owe them a hell of a lot. ... What is it? `Give
me a child until he is 6 and I will show you the man'? I'm sure
that's true. When these kids that she's looking after now grow old
and get married, they would always come back to visit this crusty
nun. It's much deeper in my background than is some billionaire's
wife.''
   The show comes from three executive producers, two of whom are
veterans of ``Barney Miller.''
   One of the latter, Jeff Stein, told the television critics that,
in a way, he was glad to be in the tough time period that ``Sister
Kate'' has drawn for the fall: opposite CBS' powerhouse ``Murder,
She Wrote'' on Sunday evenings.
   ``It's actually a good time slot because you're not expected to
win,'' Stein said. ``I mean, we're not expected to go in there and
get a 45 share (percentage of audience). We're expected to go in
there and do a good show and survive.''
   Stein said he and the other producers saw ``hundreds'' of people
for the part of Sister Kate, and even though they knew Beacham was
still under contract to ``Dynasty,'' once they saw her, the part
was hers.
   After they cast Beacham in the pilot, a lot of money was tied up
in the project. Stein said NBC Entertainment President Brandon
Tartikoff ``took a gamble'' that ABC wasn't going to pick up the
aging ``Dynasty'' for another season. If ``Dynasty'' had not been
canceled by ABC, Beacham's contractual obligation would have been
to that show.
   She seems happy things turned out the way they did. Now she's
working with a crowd of kiddies instead of the adult cast on
``Dynasty.'' She said she learned one thing immediately: ``Joan
(Collins) really wasn't as difficult as I had thought she was.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   AN END FOR `DYNASTY'? _ Stephanie Beacham, who played Sable
Colby on ABC's ``Dynasty,'' says the producers of the canceled
night-time soap are considering doing a wrap-up special when all
the actors are available next spring. Beacham is doing the new NBC
comedy, ``Sister Kate'' in the fall. ``I think the viewers being
stranded is very bad, and I think there's a lot of resentment and
there is talk of doing something in Europe in what would be
everybody's hiatus next March,'' she said. ``It would have to be in
Europe, and when I asked (executive producer) Esther Shapiro why,
she said, because we haven't got any sets. So we're all going to
have to go and visit Crystal in Switzerland, she said. So it hasn't
been totally laid to rest. There is still a possibility.''

   Northern Ireland erupted into violence on Aug.
14, 1969. Twenty years and 2,740 deaths later, the violence
continues. But much has changed in recent years and some in the
British province are beginning to see the foundations of a
solution. Here is a report by an Associated Press correspondent who
covers Northern Ireland regularly.

<TEXT>
   All Mrs. Murphy's neighbors are
gone.
   The house she and her husband bought on Roe St. stands alone in
a no-man's land, its windows protected by steel mesh and a tall
corrugated wall separating the Roman Catholic couple from
Protestant families 200 yards down the street.
   Susan Murphy's neighborhood once was mixed, with Protestants and
Roman Catholics living side by side. But Northern Ireland's
violence came to Roe St. and the stonings and firebombings proved
more than Mrs. Murphy's neighbors could bear.
   They went off to live among their own and authorities tore down
their houses.
   But the Murphys held out.
   It all happened not 20 years ago, when ``The Troubles'' were at
their worst in the British province, also known as Ulster, but just
five months ago, and the houses razed were not hovels but new
showcases of a Belfast rising from the Victorian slums.
   ``It's something of an indictment of society here,'' says Ivan
Maginnis of the Housing Executive that had to make the decision.
``It's an awful tragedy.''
   It's easy to conclude from this million-dollar exercise that
little has changed in Northern Ireland since British troops arrived
Aug. 14, 1969 to separate rioting Protestants from their Catholic
neighbors.
   The death toll is over 2,740 and rising almost week by week. The
Catholic unemployment rate is 2{ times that of Protestants. A
political solution still looks far off.
   And yet one finds a glimmer of optimism in Northern Ireland
today.
   Violence has diminished from a peak of 467 killings in 1972 to
an average of 80 a year in the 1980s.
   Recent elections suggest a weakening of the hard-liners on both
sides of the divide and a boost for the moderates.
   In the Irish Republic to the south, the political mold shaped in
the country's 1921-23 civil war has cracked and opened new
possibilities for a solution that can accommodate both Unionist and
Nationalist in Northern Ireland.
   The Unionists are the majority Protestants intent on retaining
union with Britain, and Nationalists are the 40-percent Catholic
minority whose aspirations lean to the Irish Republic.
   The Irish government in Dublin has not renounced its claim to
Northern Ireland. It simply doesn't state it too loudly. It is in
consensus with the British government that nothing can change
without Protestant consent.
   In a half dozen of Northern Ireland's 26 district councils,
moderate Catholics and Protestants have joined in coalitions to
shut out the extremists on both sides.
   Dungannon, a town of 15,000 in the center of the province, was
once a bastion of Unionist supremacy and discrimination. Now its
mixed council has a committee to promote cross-community
understanding and sends Protestant and Catholic children on
vacations together.
   The whole island, north and south, is in intellectual ferment
over the prospect that a united Europe _ beginning with the
lowering of trade barriers in the European Economic Community in
1992 _ will subsume old nationalist rivalries in Ireland.
   ``National sovereignty is changing its whole meaning in European
terms,'' says John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, the province's main Catholic nationalist party. ``The nation
state is disappearing. So the fundamental reason for the quarrel
between Britain and Ireland is now gone.''
   A backwater 20 years ago, Northern Ireland now has air links to
European resorts. A burgeoning Catholic middle class hungers for
stability. A retail boom has transformed the bombed-blackened city
centers of Belfast and Londonderry.
   Aidan O'Reilly's family was driven out of their home in 1973 by
Protestant mobs. Married now with a baby son, O'Reilly owns a house
in a quiet Belfast suburb. He is one of the thousands who look back
on the old days and pray they'll never return.
   By pouring some $2.25 billion a year into the province, Britain
can actually buy pockets of stability. Councilor Anthony McGonnell,
a 40-year-old schoolteacher, says Dungannon's new approach is
helped along by the knowledge that ``if a council is seen to be
trying to work together, central government is much more
sympathetic towards it.''

   Ralph Brown, a 52-year-old Unionist councilor whose appliance
store on Dungannon's main street has been damaged 11 times by Irish
Republican Army bombs, strongly backs municipal power-sharing.
   ``A lot of trust has been built up,'' he says. ``People are
really bending over backward at the moment to try and ensure that
nothing major goes wrong.''
   Paul Bew, an analyst at Queen's University in Belfast, was
deeply pessimistic in the mid-1980s. Now he feels things are
looking up.
   ``I am more modestly optimistic about some kind of accommodation
in Ireland than I have been for a long, long time,'' he says.
   Hume suggests a round-table conference of all the parties _ the
Irish in Dublin, the British and the Northerners _ to define the
problem, then solve it.
   Unionists prefer some sort of power-sharing arrangement with
Catholics, provided the Irish government is not involved. That
distance between the two positions is great, but at least the two
sides are talking about solutions.
   The trouble is that life is not improving in the blue-collar
ghettoes, where pockets of 80-percent unemployment provide recruits
for the IRA and Sinn Fein, its political backer in the campaign to
end British rule in Ulster and unite it with the southern republic.
   Sinn Fein's Francis McCann, a Belfast city councilor, says none
of the prosperity of recent years has reached his constituency. And
the Dungannon spirit hasn't reached Belfast, whose
Unionist-dominated council hasn't given a single committee seat to
a Nationalist.
   McCann, a 36-year-old man with ``IRELAND'' tattooed on his arm,
says he has endured jailings, internment without trial, countless
arrests and house searches, and all because ``I believe that Irish
people have a right to resist British rule in this country.''
   Hume, the voice of Catholic moderation, denounces the IRA,
producing statistics indicating that two-thirds of those killed
since 1969 were Catholics, and 44 percent of them victims of the
IRA.
   ``The IRA have killed six times more people than the British
army and 30 times more people than the RUC (Royal Ulster
Constabulary). ... Those figures alone would force anybody to say
to themselves, `Hold on a minute, where are our methods leading
us?'''
   Northern Ireland was set up in 1921 as a British enclave when
the rest of Ireland won independence and became a Protestant
fiefdom rife with gerrymandering, police brutality and
discrimination in housing and jobs.
   In 1968, Catholics began demanding civil rights. Violent
Protestant reaction brought in the British army, which soon found
itself at war with the IRA. In 1972, the government in London
closed Northern Ireland's Parliament and assumed direct rule.
   In 1985, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed the Anglo-Irish
Agreement giving Dublin a say in the running of the province.
Outraged Unionists, who regard Ireland as a hostile Catholic state,
reacted violently.
   But their protests were ignored, and they are finally beginning
to talk about negotiating a solution.
   Meanwhile, some Catholics concede that many of the grievances of
the 1960s have been rectified. Gerrymandering and housing
discrimination have been swept away by decree from London. Under
new fair-employment laws, employers guilty of discrimination face
fines the equivalent of $48,000 and the loss of government grants
and contracts.
   But unemployment is around 18 percent, Britain's highest, and
violence drives away investment and jobs.
   Policing remains a thorny problem. The Royal Ulster Constabulary
went some way toward evenhandedness by standing up to the riots
against the Anglo-Irish Agreement. But every Catholic, moderate or
militant, has a story to tell of physical or verbal abuse by the
mostly Protestant security patrols.
   McGonnell says security-force misbehavior is one of the major
reasons why the vote for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
still hovers around 11 percent. Bew, the Queen's University
analyst, believes that only massive aid for Catholic west Belfast
can eat into Sinn Fein's support there.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is 9:45 on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday
morning and you are standing by the driveway outside the Rayburn
House Office Building. Up draws a limousine and out pour the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a squad of
briefcase-toting colonels.
   Here comes another and out comes the secretary of agriculture.
Then the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, the director of
the Office of Management and Budget, the surgeon general in starchy
white.
   It is something to see, the arrival of officialdom at Congress'
doorsteps to appear before committees and subcommittees, to ask, to
explain, to defend, to dodge, to woo _ and to demonstrate that the
checks and balances concept is alive and well in Washington.
   Officials arrive at other congressional buildings and the
Capitol itself, but because all going to Rayburn use a single
entrance, it is a fine place to behold the phenomenon. Tuesdays,
Wednesdays or Thursdays are best, because those are Congress' three
full workdays.
   Every town has a few places, people or phenomena that are
uniquely its own _ just as the waltz of arriving officialdom is
Washington's alone. Here are a few other Washington institutions:
   _The Billy Goat Trail. It is a hiking trail on the Maryland
banks of the Potomac. If you think of Washington as an effete city
where no work gets done but words get spoken, the terrain's
unexpected roughness, in such proximity to the city, will surprise
you.
   Why, one could fall off the trail and roll down the steep
hillside into the rocks of the Potomac! No OSHA to come to the
rescue.
   Edward Evangelidi, a hiking writer, says of the four-mile Billy
Goat Trail: ``It is shaped by many elements of nature. At times it
is inundated and scoured by rampaging floods of the Potomac. Its
unusual flora barely survives in the hot, dry relentless summer
suns and rocky geography.'' He suggests you watch out for snakes.
There are places where you'll find yourself hiking on all fours, or
grabbing hold of a wedge of rock. You might as well be in Wyoming.
   _Red Lion Row. This is quintessential Washington architecture:
the architecture of compromise. The owners wanted to tear down the
late Federal and Greek Revival and Victorian houses along the 2000
block of Pennsylvania Avenue, four blocks west of the White House,
to make room for yet another block-long behemoth office building.
Preservationists said no, those little houses are vital reminders
of the scale and style of the city as it was when Lincoln paced the
streets.
   A bargain was reached. The old two-story buildings were saved
and converted to stores and offices; the behemoth rose attached to
and behind them. The old houses, not just their facades, were
retained; this was not just another face-saving gesture. Like most
compromises, what results is not entirely satisfactory to everyone.
   _Stephen Wade. This entertainer came here about the same time
Ronald Reagan did but outlasted his fellow showman. Wade came from
Chicago to play the banjo and tell tall tales for a few weeks' run
in a basement theater at at Arena Stage. Washington, charmed, won't
let him go.
   A man of beguiling passion, Wade reminds people of their human
commonality. He has revised his act, but the title of his first
show best gives the flavor: ``Banjo Dancing, or the 48th Annual
Squitters Mountain Song Dance Folklore Convention and Banjo Contest
and How I Lost.''
   _Rock Creek's Meadows. Washingtonian Peggy Fleming is a citizen
nature-lover who by dint of determination became a National Park
Service ranger. Then she persuaded the authorities to stop mowing
the grass in a few swatches of Rock Creek Park, which runs through
the city.
   Controversy, as you can imagine, ensued. Some people think
unmowed grass is mayhem, and even a park needs discipline, but
Peggy Fleming prevailed. Twenty-three of the park's 3,000 acres
were allowed to go wild. They are mowed once a year to keep them
from becoming forests.
   The result: not lawn, not woods, but something in between. The
next result: new flora and fauna that flourish only under such
circumstances.
   Voila! Goldfinches, short-tailed shrews, purpletop grass,
six-feet tall bull thistles, owls, the pearl crescent butterfly _
all thriving where they otherwise hadn't and wouldn't.
   Like Stephen Wade's banjo, Peggy Fleming's Meadows are a
Washington miracle, the unexpected pleasure; like the high-stepping
colonels, the short-tailed shrews are a sight to behold.

   Ruined medieval fortresses stand
silhouetted against the sky on scorched mountaintops across Soviet
Georgia and atop each one flies a flag of the Georgian independence
movement.
   The flags fly as well on police outposts and are sold at Tbilisi
newsstands in the form of lapel pins and dashboard suction cups.
One hangs over a highway from a peasant's plot,
   This land of glaciered crags, fruit-filled valleys and Black Sea
beaches is seething with resentment against the ``invaders'' from
Russia who took over their infant republic in 1921.
   Since troops armed with sharp shovels and toxic gas clashed with
pro-independence protesters in this capital April 9, killing 19 of
them, sympathy has grown for those Georgians who want to secede
from the Soviet Union.
   But the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia _ a kingdom on its
own in the Middle Ages _ also is rent by ethnic violence, much of
it pitting Christian Georgians against Moslem minorities.
   It is an explosive combination on the heels of April 9.
   ``This is the last thing Georgia needs right now,'' says Gizo
Grzeledze, an official in the Georgian Foreign Ministry. ``It will
bring the troops back.''
   The ethnic violence is spawned in part by reaction to the
Georgians' rising nationalism.
   Hatreds and resentments dating back to the medieval times have
reappeared among the dozen nationalities in the republic, which is
about half the size of Arkansas.
   Conflicts pitting Georgians against Moslem Abkhazians and
Azerbaijanis have cost 26 lives and injured more than 450 in
several areas of Georgia since the summer began. Georgians in the
Meskhetian area guard their homes against ethnic Turks living there.
   At the same time, independence activists persuaded tens of
thousands of workers to walk off their jobs in a general strike,
crippling transport and even a military jet factory.
   Thousands more have gathered in daily illegal meetings in
downtown Tbilisi.
   Even officials in the government ministry across the street from
the gathering were hanging out their windows one recent day to
listen to activist Sviad Gamsachurdia, who said that in 1976 he
could count just 20 or 30 people willing to join his call for
independence.
   In a Tbilisi suburb, vandals smashed the face and tore the head
off a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin, the revered founder of the
Soviet Union, while a statue of the dictator Josef V. Stalin, a
Georgian, stands unscathed.
   The combustible mixture of nationalist unrest and ethnic
violence is risky not only for Georgia but also the rest of the
country, said Shalva Shanidze, Communist Party leader of the
Akhaltsike region in the Meskhetian area.
   By strengthening the hard-liners, he maintained, the activists
are endangering all of the Soviet Union and its moves toward
democracy and economic autonomy. More than 100 ethnic groups live
in the 15 Soviet republics.
   But Gamsachurdia, a grey-haired veteran of Georgia's resistance
to Soviet power, says he is concerned only with the fate of
Georgia, not the Soviet Union; the fate of Georgia, he maintains,
is threatened by what he sees as Islamic fundamentalism spilling
over the border from Iran.
   It is a measure of the Georgian public's sharing in
Gamsachurdia's belief that the question activists and Georgian
Communist officials alike pose to a visitor is not whether the
United States would help Georgia break from Moscow but whether it
would help an independent, Christian Georgia against Islamic
fundamentalist Iran.
   The independence demonstrations of April have turned into
demonstrations involving ethnic differences and religious
backgrounds.
   The Christian Orthodox Church remains deeply rooted among
Georgians and still commands respect, although the Soviet
government fosters atheism. A number of very old churches have been
preserved in Georgia.
   Conflict between Christians and Moslems goes back centuries in
the Soviet Caucasus region, particularly in Georgia and neighboring
Soviet Armenia.
   Thousands of Georgians filled Rustaveli Ave. in Tbilisi daily
demonstrations during recent ethnic rioting between Georgians and
Moslems in the Abkhazian region, a Black Sea resort area.
   Commanders of the 4,500 Soviet troops sent to quell the rioting
said there were attempts to provoke the troops into firing on the
population in what would have been a horrifying repeat of April 9
in Tblisi.
   A letter from the Georgian National Front to the United Nations
in New York charged that the violence in Abkhazia was organized by
Moscow. It asked for U.N. troops because, it claimed, Soviet troops
were protecting only Abkhazians, not Georgians.
   Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin of the Soviet army said his troops
confiscated thousands of weapons from both Georgians and
Abkhazians, including explosives and machine guns.
   Lovard Tukhashvili of the Georgian Institute of History,
Archeology and Ethnography said he believes the rioting was
instigated by Abkhazians who stand to lose their privileges to
Gorbachev's reforms or to an independent Georgia.
   Abkhazians number just 80,000, 17 percent of Georgia's 5.3
million people, but they dominate the power structure and
managerial jobs in their region, Tukhashvili said.
   The Abkhazians contend, however, they are struggling for equal
rights and feel they will achieve them only by seceding from
Georgia and becoming a 16th republic of the Soviet Union, according
to Abkhazian legislator Vladislav Ardzinba.
   Minorities in Georgia are reacting to growing Georgian
nationalism, inextricably woven into the independence movement,
Ardzinba said.
   But Georgians tell outsiders that this is Georgian land.
Abkhazians, Azerbaijanis and Meskhetian Turks make equally detailed
claims to the contrary.
   Georgia was a kingdom from the 4th century B.C. to the 14th
century A.D. In 1555, western Georgia fell to Turkey and eastern
Georgia to Persia, now Iran. It became part of the Russian Empire
in 1783 and had a spell of independence in 1918-21, after the
Bolsheviks seized power in Moscow.
   Because Georgians resisted the new Soviet power, a quarter of
their land was turned over to other ethnic groups.
   Tukhashvili, the historian, said Stalin did his fellow Georgians
no favors when he had whole nationalities deported from traditional
homelands to Central Asia.
   For example, he said, the Georgians who moved onto the lands of
the deported Meskhetian Turks now face nearly 400,000 Meskhetians
clamoring to return and reclaim their homes.
   For Grzeledze of the Georgian Foreign Ministry, it is no
coincidence that the Azerbaijanis, Turks and most of the Abkhazians
are Moslems, traditional enemies of Christian Georgia.
   Georgia voluntarily joined the Russian Empire because it was the
only Christian alternative to domination by Turks and Persians.
   Nearly two centuries have passed, but the geography hasn't
changed.
   Persia is now revolutionary Iran, under the rule of Moslem
mullahs dedicated to spreading Islamic fundamentalism, and the high
birth rates of Moslems have the Georgians fearful of becoming
minorities in their own land.

<TEXT>
   ``We are not guests!'' says Achmed
Ragimov, an Azerbaijani engineer in this city in the south of
Soviet Georgia. ``We feel this is our land.''
   Georgians are equally vehement that the area around Marneuli is
traditionally Georgian, and the dispute is not ancient history
here. In June, five people died in ethnic violence in the district.
   Georgians claim they are gracious hosts who welcome refugees and
bear no ill will to other ethnic groups. But they infuriate the
Abkhazian, Azerbaijani and Turkish residents of Georgia by
insisting they are just guests.
   ``I certainly don't feel like a guest,'' said Ali Gasanov, who
lives in a largely Azerbaijani area of Georgia around Marneuli.
``My family has been here for 200 years.''
   Growing Georgian demands for independence from the Soviet Union
_ Georgia is now a Soviet republic _ have prompted the Azerbaijanis
of the Marneuli area to call for secession from Georgia. The
population of the area is now three-quarters Azerbaijani due to the
Moslem preference for large families.
   One summer night in Marneuli, an industrial city, a car full of
youths careened about the town warning of an impending attack by
Georgians.
   ``Several thousand men gathered, armed with axes, iron bars,
clubs, and knives,'' said a local Communist Party official, T.G.
Beridze.
   ``But nothing happened,'' said Anna Kleshnina, another party
official.
   She added, however, that men carying green Islamic flags moved
on to the nearby towns of Bolnisi and Dmanisiu, spreading the word:
``The Georgians are finished with Marneuli and now they are coming
to get you.''
   Fighting soon broke out, and the five deaths occurred there, she
said.
   The 17-year-old Gasanov also blamed Georgian discrimination for
his inability to find a job. Ragimov complained that Georgians
commuting from Tbilisi, the republic's capital, are claiming all
the local managerial jobs.
   Several older residents in the crowd that quickly gathered
around a visiting correspondent insisted that the multi-national
residents of Marneuli ``live together like brothers.''
   ``I was born here, and I've never had any problems,'' said
Farida Orudjeva. ``This land is Soviet. It's not his or mine.''
   But that sentiment, which native Georgian Josef V. Stalin tried
to instill by uprooting whole nationalities from their homelands,
is proving to be rare among the myriad minorities of the Soviet
Union.

   Every day at noon, Estonian activists
gather in Tallinn's Old Town to collect signatures for a proposed
referendum on the secession of their Baltic republic from the
Soviet Union, a right guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution.
   Five years ago, before the reforms of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, such a petition would have been a sure ticket to prison.
Even a year ago, such a notion seemed out of the question.
   But for nearly 500,000 non-Estonians in the Baltic republic it
could mean trouble and some are raising their voices in protest.
   In late July, several thousand of non-Estonians struck major
factories in Tallinn, returning to work only when the Estonian
government set up a commission to assuage their fears that they
might someday be exiled from Estonia.
   ``A lot of people have no other homeland. Where would we go?''
said Gennady Korol, of the 56-member coordinating committee of
Intermovement, formed last summer by Russian residents of Estonia.
   ``We just want to defend ourselves. We want our children to grow
up here,'' said Korol, assigned by Intermovement as liaison with
the strikers.
   Every day, the drama is acted out at the petition table in Old
Town.
   A muscular man strides up to the table and writes on a petition
in Russian: ``Throw the Estonians out of the USSR so they won't
disgrace us.'' He marches off, without signing his name.
   The situation is similar in the two neighboring Baltic
republics, Latvia and Lithuanian, where Russian-speaking movements
have organized to counter the march to autonomy.
   The conflict stems from the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939,
which gave Germany most of Poland and gave Moscow eastern Poland
and the Baltic republics. Recent Baltic newspaper accounts have
reported that hundreds of thousands of Balts were killed or exiled
under Red Army occupation, and a government commission in Moscow is
reviewing the 1939 pact to determine whether Soviet annexation of
the Baltic republics was legal.
   ``A lot of time has passed since the 1940s. It's not our fault
how the war turned out,'' said Korol, who has lived in Tallinn
since his mother, a war widow, married a Red Army soldier and moved
here in 1944, when Gennady was 3.
   Since the annexation, hundreds of thousands of non-Estonians
have settled in the republic, working mostly in heavy industries
that the Estonians complain pollute their environment without
giving them material benefit.
   Of the 1.6 million people in Estonia, 65 percent are Estonian by
nationality, and most of the rest are ``Russian-speakers'' from
Slavic republics, 28 percent Russian, 3 percent Ukrainian and 2
percent Byelorussian.
   The Baltic republics won a major victory July 27 when the
national legislature in Moscow voted overwhelming for a law that
would grant them economic autonomy from Moscow starting Jan. 1.
   Details remain to be worked out and the law must be voted on
twice more, but Mikhail Bronshtein, author of the idea, said in an
interview it will allow Estonia, Lativa and Lithuania to print
their own currencies and take control of industry and agriculture
from Moscow-based ministries.
   But ``the Estonian people are realists'' and will not seek full
independence, said Bronshtein, 66, a member of the Communist Party
and head of the political-economic faculty at Estonia's Tartu
University.
   The Russians will not be exiled, but their status will change,
said Rein Veidemann, chairman of the Estonian People's Front, the
mass movement that is working with the Estonian Communist Party for
greater autonomy.
   ``Until now, they have lived like a privileged class,'' he added
in an interview. ``They came, got new apartments more quickly than
Estonians, and quickly landed places in the governing apparatus.
   ``We want an equal chance to take part in governing Estonia.''
   Russian residents want to stop what they see as the Baltics'
slide toward independence. They claim their rights were undercut by
laws recently passn for office.
   ``We're against separatism,'' said Vasily Anson, 46, a truck
driver and chairman of the strike committee at the Tallinn
Autotransport Affialiate No. 8.
   Interviewed at the Tallin Ship Repair Yard with other strikers,
Anson said his family was exiled from Estonia before the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution, and that he settled here in 1965.
   ``My wife, a Byelorussian, worked for 22 years in one of the
worst factories here, and we just got an apartment in 1987,'' Anson
said. The Soviet government owns virtually all housing and much of
its is controlled by state-run factories, such as the one his wife
works for.
   ``Now, the Estonian legislature has passed a law making Estonian
the official language,'' Anson added. ``The other day, we got a
letter written in Estonian saying that she must take an examination
in Estonian in two months. If she doesn't pass, she can be fired
for lack of professional qualifications and we will lose the
apartment. We will have nowhere to live.''
   The Ansons have a 16-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter.
   Another strike committee member, shipyard worker Mikhail
Zakariadze, moved to Tallinn from Soviet Georgia in 1983. He
married another Georgian two years ago, and they now have two
children.
   After living in dormitories for five years, he became elegible
to move with his family into a two-room apartment last year.
   ``But the city executive committee would not let me move there,
because I had not lived in Estonia for 10 years. They said
Estonians should get first crack at new apartments,'' said
Zakariadze.
   The Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee was scheduled to
hold a plenum on nationality problems in July, at which the Baltic
dispute would be on the agenda. But Kremlin leaders have postponed
the session while they grapple behind the scenes with the emotions
that have boiled to the surface with the greater openness in the
Soviet Union.

   The Bush administration and congressional
negotiators reached agreement Thursday night on financing a
sweeping $159 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry
after Senate Republicans torpedoed a Democratic plan.
   The compromise was reached after a series of fast-paced
developments in which President Bush threatened to veto the bill,
the Democratic-controlled House ignored him in on a 221-199 vote in
favor of it and Senate Democrats fell six votes short of mustering
the 60 needed to complete action.
   That automatically tossed the bill back into a House-Senate
conference committee, which locked up the deal after 11 p.m..
Approval is expected by the full Senate, and then the House, on
Friday, the last day before the August colngressional vacation.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and White House Budget
Director Richard Darman accepted a compromise proposal splitting
the cost of the bailout so that only 40 percent of the $50 billion
needed immediately would balloon the federal deficit.
   The deal calls for the Treasury to borrow $20 billion this year,
raising the estimated deficit from $149 billion to $169 billion,
and borrowing by a new agency to raise the $30 billion balance next
year and the year after without counting that in the official
deficit.
   ``Obviously we've only had an opportunity to make a quick
review, but based on that review ... in the spirit of which the
president sent us here, which was one of compromise, we accept,''
Brady said.
   The compromise was approved on a 26-22 vote among House members
of the conference committee despite vehement objections from Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee. Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., was the only one of the five
Senate negotiators to vote against the deal.
   All of the money would be used to close some 500 insolvent S&amp;Ls
_ the bulk of them in Texas _ and pay off savers whose federally
insured deposits were lost through failed an often fraudulent loans.
   The administration and Congress had reached agreement long ago
on the bulk of the legislation directing a massive overhaul of the
industry's structure and regulation in an effort to prevent a
recurrence of the cisis.
   But a confrontation over the financing which one Democrat
characterized as a ``game of chicken'' had threatened to blow the
deal apart.
   With S&amp;L losses mounting at a rate of $20 million to $30 million
a day, both the administration and congressional leaders were
adamant in their demands that the fix be approved before the
vacation recess.
   ``Ninety percent of the people want to get out of here,'' said
Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., chairman of the House Rules Committee.
``They have reservations for vacation.''
   Darman earlier had called the $20 billion-$30 billion,
on-budget-off-budget split ``conceptually sound'' but declined to
give it a blanket endorsement without a vote on it among the
congressional negotiators.
   Prior to Thursday night, the administration has steadfastly
demanded that all of the bailout's costs be raised 30-year bonds
issued outside the normal Treasury borrowing process, and outside
the official deficit.
   The bill also would institute a major overhaul of the
government's regulation of the nation's nearly 3,000 thrifts and
require their owners to put billions of dollars more of their own
money at risk.
   ``Both of them are turkeys,'' Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said of
the alternative Bush and Democratic plans for raising the bailout's
costs. ``It's a question of the lesser of two evils.''
   Democrats contended Bush's plan would increase the cost by $150
million a year over the next three decades because the bonds would
carry higher interest rates than normal U.S. Treasury obligations.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., described the dispute as
``politics, plain and simple.''
   ``The only difference now is they (Republicans) do not want the
deficit number to go up the first year of the Bush
administration,'' he said. ``If it did not cost any money to not
tell the truth, that would be fine. But not telling the truth is
going to cost $4.5 billion to $60 billion.''
   Bush issued his veto threat early in the day, shortly before the
House began debating the bill that has been months in the drafting.
   ``If the conference report is presented to me in its current
form, I will veto the bill,'' he said. ``While
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings is not perfect, it represents the only
available institutional requirement for fiscal discipline by the
Congress and the executive branch.''
   Over the next 10 years, the costs, including interest, would
rise to $159 billion, according to the latest administration
estimates. The interest costs over future years push the
three-decade total for the rescue to more than $285 billion _ $157
billion of it from taxpayers.
   S&amp;Ls would have to devote more of their lending to home
mortgages. Their investments in risky real estate ventures would be
curtailed and their purchases of junk bonds would be outlawed.
   It also would remove five decades of prohibitions on bank
ownership of S&amp;Ls, enabling banks to buy out their most competitive
lending market rivals in many communities.
   A new government agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., would be
established to dispose of between $100 billion and $400 billion in
real estate and other property falling into the government's
custody.
   The property was used as collateral behind loans that defaulted
when real estate markets _ particularly in the Southwest _
collapsed with declining oil prices, contributing to the failure of
more than 200 S&amp;Ls last year alone.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar gained against European currencies
this morning.
   Gold prices retreated from Thursday's peaks in U.S. trading.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's advance during Asian and early
European trading mostly to position-squaring ahead of the release
today of July U.S. unemployment figures. The threat of U.S.
military action in the Middle East is lending additional support to
the currency, they said.
   ``People had been already short, and then came the events in the
Middle East,'' said Manfred Totzauer, a dealer at Citibank AG in
Frankfurt, West Germany. ``The dollar is politically supported, and
the (job) figures are already expected to be very weak, so the
chances for a rise a good.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.05 yen, up 1.65 yen from
Thursday. Later in London, the dollar declined to 137.85 yen.
   The pound traded at $1.6350, down from $1.6475 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
1.8763 West German marks, up from 1.8650; 1.6147 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6065; 6.3550 French francs, up from 6.3192; 2.1157 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0950; 1,351.80 Italian lire, up from 1,338.00,
and 1.1740 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1715.
   Gold opened in London at $371.90 a troy ounce, up from $369.75
late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $371.55 an ounce.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $371.50 an ounce.
   On Thursday, gold for August delivery closed at $373.70 a troy
ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   In Hong Kong today, gold closed at $372.86 an ounce, up $2.19
from Thursday's figure.
   Silver was trading in London at $5.29 a troy ounce, up from
$5.23 an ounce late Thursday.

   An expert in cutting through gobbledygook is
offering some free advice on how to cut the federal deficit and
ease taxpayer anxieties: simplify federal tax forms.
   ``Further simplification of tax forms and instructions _ without
compromising technical accuracy _ is possible,'' says Janice
Redish, a linguist. ``The payoff would far exceed the investment.''
   ``Such a project has the potential to collect billions of
dollars in taxes that are not now paid and the potential to change
the public's perception of the IRS and of government in general,''
Ms. Redish said Thursday to the House Ways and Means subcommittee
that oversees the Internal Revenue Service.
   Ms. Redish, who recently wrote a ``user-friendly'' owner's
manual for the Ford Taurus, cited the basic 1040, the most common
individual form, as visually overwhelming and incredibly crowded.
   ``It has 65 numbered items _ and several unnumbered ones _ all
on one piece of paper ... boxes on the left for some items and on
the right for others. It means that IRS uses small type for most
lines and then condenses that type even further to fit all the
words in other lines,'' she said.
   She got no argument from the subcommittee. Chairman J.J. Pickle,
D-Texas, had the Ways and Means hearing room decorated for the
occasion with a copy of each of the 392 federal tax forms _ enough
paper, he said, to produce a stack thicker than the District of
Columbia yellow pages.
   ``Do you need so many?'' Pickle asked a panel of IRS officials.
   ``I'm afraid so,'' replied Arthur Altman, who is in charge of
the agency's tax forms coordinating committee.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. said that as a result of
the big tax overhaul that Congress enacted in 1986, the agency had
to create 88 new forms and revise 162 others.
   ``So much for simplification,'' Pickle complained.
   ``Our tax forms and publications are often the first (and
sometimes the only) contact taxpayers have with the service,''
Goldberg said. ``The IRS has no interest in making tax forms
complicated.''
   Goldberg said the IRS is constantly reviewing to determine how
forms and publications can be simplified.
   In the works now, he said, are a simplified Form 1040A for older
taxpayers, which will include new lines for retirement income, and
a study to determine why only about one-quarter of the taxpayers
who were eligible to shift from the long Form 1040 to a shorter
form did so this year.
   Also, he said there will be a study that could lead to an
overhaul of the W-2 form, on which wages are reported by employers,
and new publications offering tax guidance for the military and for
students.

<HEAD>Task Force Studying Design Changes for DC-10, Other Big Airliners</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ A government task force will study possible design
changes in DC-10s and other wide-body airliners that will allow
pilots to retain control after an engine blowup or other in-flight
failure.
   The FAA announcement Thursday of the government and industry
task force came two weeks after the crash of a United Airlines
DC-10 that killed 111 people in Sioux City, Iowa. An explosive
engine failure apparently destroyed the plane's hydraulic flight
controls.
   The agency said similar incidents involving a Japan Air Lines
Boeing 747 in 1985 and an Eastern Airlines L-1011 in 1981 indicate
design changes may be needed to further protect flight-control
systems in flight.
   All three planes, each built by a different manufacturer, lost
hydraulic power that controls wing and tail surfaces.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, called for the FAA to
consider grounding all DC-10s.
   In a letter to the agency, Metzenbaum cited news accounts saying
that lives might have been saved in the Iowa crash if the DC-10 had
four rather than three hydraulic systems or a shut-off valve to
prevent hydraulic fluid loss.
   ``If these allegations are true, the FAA should ground all
DC-10s and correct their design flaws immediately,'' Metzenbaum
said.
   Tony Broderick, head of FAA safety regulations, said the planes
would not be grounded.
   ``There are no design flaws in the DC-10 or any other aircraft
presently flying that warrant grounding,'' he said.
   About the task force, Broderick said that safety improvements to
protect flight control systems ``are within the realm of technical
and economic feasibility.''
   The task force, he said, will include experts from the FAA,
airlines, manufacturers, industry groups and foreign aviation
safety officials. The review eventually will cover all airliners
that rely on hydraulic controls, including those built by McDonnell
Douglas, Boeing, Lockheed and the European Airbus consortium, he
said.
   Failure of hydraulic systems, Broderick said, indicates the need
for considering an extra level of safety in airliners. The task
force will be asked to come up with ``a system or a modification of
existing systems'' to allow an airliner to fly and land safely even
with complete hydraulic failure.
   The FAA approves design, construction, testing and operation of
all planes used by U.S. carriers. Many foreign governments follow
its lead.
   The FAA said the study also would cover engine design ``with an
eye toward possibly preventing crippling damage to an aircraft in
the event of an engine explosion.''
   In the Iowa crash, the FAA said the center engine apparently
ruptured, sending shrapnel through the engine casing, disabling the
primary hydraulic system and its two backups.
   The Japan crash also involved a loss of control after a rear
pressure wall ruptured, knocking out part of the vertical
stabilizer and rudder, the FAA said.
   In the L-1011 incident, the plane landed safely after parts of
its center engine penetrated the fuselage and three of its four
hydraulic systems were cut and the fourth damaged, Broderick said.
   The FAA requires that jet engines be built to contain fragments
of fans, compressors or turbine blades that may break off in
flight. But the agency says its regulation recognizes that ``there
is no practical way to contain the parts on which the blades are
mounted _ the disks _ when they fail because of their weight and
the speed at which they travel.''

   Fewer major airline flights are arriving on
time, according to the latest Transportation Department consumer
report.
   The department said Thursday that the 13 largest domestic
carriers reported 72.2 percent of their flights arrived on time in
June, compared with 79.5 percent for May.
   The department said East Coast weather was largely to blame.
Delays caused by mechanical problems are not counted in the monthly
Air Travel Consumer Report.
   The report showed a surge in complaints to the government about
airlines, with 1,119 received in July, a 30 percent increase over
June complaints.
   The overall trend, however, continued to be a decline, with July
complaints down 43 percent from the 1,969 filed for the same month
last year.
   The department keeps a file of consumer data on performance of
specific flights, airlines and airports. Much of the information is
made available through travel agents.

   The Food and Drug Administration is
investigating another drug company to determine whether it
misrepresented samples of one of its products to win FDA approval.
   Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. of Copiague, N.Y., said Thursday
that it ``unequivocally denies'' that any of the research,
formulation, manufacture or testing of its generic version of
Dyazide was compromised.
   The allegation of possible fraud came from Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of a House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee, which started the probe into the FDA's generic drug
division.
   He said documents obtained by the panel from a Baltimore testing
laboratory show that Bolar ``may well have substituted'' samples of
the originally approved brand-name Dyazide, made by SmithKline
Beecham, for its own generic version to win FDA approval.
   In June, another company, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of
Springfield Gardens, N.Y., told the FDA its company employees
appear to have switched samples of its generic Dyazide with the
brand-name product to gain approval.
   Vitarine and Bolar are the only two companies that won FDA
approval to market generic versions of the popular hypertension
drug, a combination of hydrochlorthizide and triamterene.
   Last month, Par Pharmaceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y.,
recalled its generic version of the high blood pressure drug
Maxzide because samples of the product were misrepresented in a
government inspection.
   In each of the cases, the FDA and the companies have said they
have found no evidence of safety problems with the drugs, though
FDA officials say there are concerns the drugs may be less
effective than they were supposed to be.
   Bolar, Vitarine and Par are among 11 drug makers being
investigated by the FDA.
   Agency spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the FDA is analyzing drug
samples Bolar submitted to the Baltimore lab and that though the
results are not final, ``the preliminary data has raised some
questions.''
   Generic drugs are lower-cost versions of brand-name products
whose patents have expired. Before they are approved for sale, the
FDA requires that tests show they are chemically equivalent to the
brand-name products.
   Dyazide and its generic competitors are among the most widely
prescribed drugs in the country.
   Before its first generic competition appeared in 1987, Dyazide
sales were more than $300 million annually. However, when Bolar
Pharmaceutical put its generic version on the market, SmithKline's
Dyazide sales dropped 45 percent, to $200 million in 1988,
according to Philadelphia-based SmithKline.
   Bolar reported overall sales for the first half of 1989 of $69.8
million. Its generic Dyazide is the company's largest selling drug,
said Patricia Shukri, a Bolar vice president. She declined to say
what the company's generic Dyazide sales were, but said it was less
than half of total product sales.
   Dingell said the testing lab, PharmaKinetics Laboratories,
conducted a visual examination on Bolar's samples and compared them
to SmithKline's, just as the lab had done in the case of Vitarine.
   As with Vitarine, PharmaKinetics found a color difference
between the samples tested in a bioequivalency study and samples
from more recent batches of the product, according to memos from
lab officials that were turned over to the subcommittee.
   Bolar said in its statement that the company ``reaffirms its
complete faith in the safety, effectiveness, bioequivalence and
quality of the product. The test data submitted to FDA to gain
approval reflect that Bolar's formulation is equivalent to
Dyazide.''
   Dingell's subcommittee has been investigating fraud and
corruption in the generic drug division of the FDA for months.
Information the panel uncovered and turned over to the U.S.
Attorney in Baltimore has resulted in charges against several drug
companies and their officials as well as FDA employees.

<HEAD>Half of All Americans Live in 37 Metro Areas</HEAD>

   Two centuries after the United States was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the Census
Bureau reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the 1970s when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about 86 percent of the nation's
population growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the Great Depression, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of 1987 figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.
   Led by New York and Los Angeles, these metro areas had 119
million residents in 1987, the Bureau said.
   New Jersey leads the way as the only state entirely included
within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion
of the state is included in the greater New York metro area while
the southern portion is part of the Philadelphia region.
   Seven other states have more than 90 percent of their
populations in metropolitan areas _ California, Maryland,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts and New York.
   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about 20 percent
of its residents in urban areas, the report added.
   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan
area growth has tended to flow to the South and West in recent
years, the Census Bureau observed in its study of growth patterns
between 1980 and 1987.
   The population loss experienced in the Northeast during the
1970s has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the
Midwest has continued to have net losses in recent years.
   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 in
much of the interior of the United States, especially in
nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by Donald E.
Starsinic and Richard L. Forstall.
   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10
contiguous states _ Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, the
bureau pointed out.
   The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as of
July 1, 1987, were New York, 18.0 million; Los Angeles, 13.5
million; Chicago, 8.1 million; San Francisco, 5.9 million;
Philadelphia, 5.9 million; Detroit, 4.6 million; Boston, 4.1
million; Dallas, 3.7 million;
   Also Washington, 3.6 million; Houston, 3.6 million; Miami, 2.9
million; Cleveland, 2.7 million; Atlanta, 2.6 million; St. Louis,
2.4 million; Seattle, 2.3 million; Minneapolis, 2.3 million;
Baltimore, 2.3 million; Pittsburgh, 2.3 million;
   And San Diego, 2.3 million; Tampa, 1.9 million; Phoenix, 1.9
million; Denver, 1.8 million; Cincinnati, 1.7 million; Milwaukee,
1.5 million; Kansas City, 1.5 million; Portland, Ore., 1.4 million;
Norfolk, Va., 1.3 million;
   Plus Sacramento, 1.3 million; New Orleans, 1.3 million;
Columbus, Ohio, 1.3 million; San Antonio, Texas, 1.3 million;
Indianapolis, 1.2 million; Buffalo, N.Y., 1.2 million; Providence,
R.I., 1.1 million; Charlotte, N.C., 1.1 million; Hartford, Conn.,
1.1 million and Salt Lake City, 1.1 million.

   The Agriculture Department says 1988 grain
shipments from the United States remained of high quality even
though drought cut yields.
   The report by the Federal Grain Inspection Service, released
Thursday, compared inspection records from 1988 and previous years
for wheat, corn, soybeans and other grains.
   The report said wheat moisture decreased or remained the same
for all lots, except hard red spring wheat. For hard red spring
wheat, the average moisture was 11.9 percent, up from 11.8 percent
in 1987.
   Wheat represented 36 percent of the total 115.7 million metric
tons of grains and oilseeds exported in 1988.
   Nearly half the 42 million metric tons of exported wheat was
hard red winter wheat; 19 percent white wheat; 15 percent hard red
spring wheat; 14 percent soft winter wheat; 2 percent durum; and
less than 1 percent mixed wheat.
   The report said corn moisture and the amount of damaged kernels
decreased, but there was a small increase reported in broken corn
and the presence of foreign material.
   Corn represented 40.7 percent of the total metric tons of grains
and oilseeds exported in 1988. Except for a fraction, almost all
was yellow corn.
   Soybeans showed an increase in test weight and a decrease in
amount of damaged kernels, but an increase in the amount of foreign
material and split soybeans.
   Soybeans accounted for 15.7 percent of total exports of grains
and oilseeds in 1988, the report said.
   The other products are sorghum, barley, sunflower seeds, rye,
flaxseed and oats.

   The Agriculture Department has issued its
first permit for the use of genetically altered trees under the
notion that what's sauce for the potato is sauce for the poplar.
   The department said the permit, announced last week, will enable
investigators at Iowa State University in Ames to study a natural
plant defense mechanism that has been transferred from the potato.
   Twenty poplar trees, cloned for uniformity, will be tested to
see if the defense mechanism is ``switched on'' when the trees are
threatened by insects and other pests, thus saving plant energy
when there is no threat.
   The genetically altered trees won't be allowed to bloom or
produce seeds, USDA says.

   Americans cut back on their fresh fruit
consumption in 1988, the Agriculture Department says.
   Per capita fruit consumption was estimated at 211.3 pounds in
1988, compared with the previous year's record of 214.3 pounds.
   ``Most of the decrease was attributed to reduced consumption of
fresh fruit,'' the department said in its outlook and situation
summary for fruit published this week.

<HEAD>SEC Files Complaint Against Penny Stock Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed
a complaint charging two companies and 14 people with running a
penny stock scam that bilked investors of at least $10 million.
   The complaint, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
alleges the defendants secretly controlled the stock of the two
companies and artificially raised the share price before selling at
large profits.
   When investors discovered that the companies had little or no
real assets, ``they were left holding the bag,'' said Stanley
Whitten, chief investigator for the SEC's Chicago office.
   The SEC is seeking a injunctions against the two companies, GSS
Venture Capital Corp. and Max Inc., and the 14 persons named in the
complaint for violating federal securities laws, Whitten said.
   He refused to say whether other federal agencies were pursuing
criminal charges against those named in the SEC complaint.
   Buying and selling shares in the two companies _ which were not
listed on any exchange _ effectively ended after the SEC suspended
trading for ten days in June 1987, Whitten said.
   GSS Venture Capital Corp. listed Marina del Rey, Calif., as its
headquarters, although it was previously based in Ft. Lauderdale,
Fla., and Max Inc. gave Orem, Utah, as its headquarters, Whitten
said. There were no telephone listings for either company.
   He said the SEC also filed a motion to freeze the assets of the
companies and the alleged ringleaders of the operation: Arnold
Kimmes, of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.; Thomas Quinn, of New York
City; and Michael Wright, of Salt Lake City.
   Quinn is being held by authorities in France for his alleged
involvement in fraudulent business deals in that country, Whitten
said.
   The SEC complaint alleges that the two companies were created by
Kimmes, Quinn, Wright and others involved in the scheme.
   The complaint charges them with secretly buying the stock in an
initial offering and then artificially boosting the price through
such fraudulent means as announcing impending mergers that never
happened, Whitten said.
   They also allegedly coordinated the buying and selling of shares
to investors at huge profits, he said.
   Before trading in both companies was suspended, Max's stock
climbed from an original price of 15 cents per share in 1985 to a
high of $6 per share, while stock in GSS rose from an initial share
price of 15 cents in 1986 to more than $3, Whitten said.
   Investors around the country who heard about the companies
through news releases that the firms put out invested more than $10
million in both companies only to find their shares were worthless,
he added.
   Others named in the complaint are: Michael Kimmes, Arnold
Kimmes' son, Auburn, Calif; Arthur Packard Condie, Springville,
Utah; Robert Matzner, Long Island City, N.Y.; Patrick Moore, Laguna
Beach, Calif.; Martin Hirsh, North Woodmere, N.Y.; Raymond Morris,
Aurora, Colo.; Dennis Denoble, Park City, Utah; Eloise Barney, Salt
Lake City; Terri Lee Graff, Orem, Utah; Debby Romney, Salt Lake
City; and Joan Hosey, Sacramento, Calif.

   Prosecutors say losses suffered by victims of the
illegal schemes that resulted in charges against traders at
Chicago's futures markets were significant, but at least two
investors expressed surprise to learn they had been bilked.
   The exchanges, meanwhile, still feeling the sting of indictments
against 46 traders Wednesday, took steps to implement tougher rules
and penalties and increase scrutiny of the trading floor.
   The head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said Thursday the
measures were intended ``to put the fear of God into the
membership.''
   The Chicago Board of Trade took out full-page ads in today's
editions of several newspapers, including The New York Times and
The Washington Post. In them, the exchange promises to investigate
all reports of wrongdoing and take disciplinary action against
those found guilty.
   And the Chicago Sun-Times reported in today's editions that more
than 100 additional traders will be indicted this year as a result
of the investigation, according to unnamed defense and government
sources.
   David Neisler of El Paso, Ill., identified in the indictments as
one of the customers victimized by the illegal trading practices,
said Thursday, ``I don't know what to make of the whole thing.''
   Neisler said he has used the futures markets for nearly 20 years
as a hedge against his investment in the soybean crop he grows on
part of a 1,500-acre family farm.
   ``I don't suppose I'll know how much is gone until this goes
through trial,'' Neisler said. ``But it's like somebody telling you
that you got gypped when you bought clothes at the department store
not too long ago, and not telling you much else,'' he said.
   ``You don't know how much, you don't why, you just know you've
been gypped.''
   Peter Gerlikas, another investor identified in the indictments,
said he lost $6,000 in a year and had heard talk of illegal trading
activities from friends at the Board of Trade.
   ``I'd heard rumors, but I traded through a reputable company and
I didn't figure this would touch me,'' said Gerlikas, a 31-year-old
who runs a string of small businesses from his home in the
northwest Chicago suburb of Palatine.
   ``Looking back now, I have no real way of knowing how much, if
any, of the $6,000 was taken through illegal trades.''
   Gerlikas said, however, he might return to the Merc in the
future.
   ``There'll always be dishonesty,'' he said, ``but I've got a
feeling they're going to clean things up this time around.''
   Both exchanges sought to get started with the cleanup Thursday.
   ``The integrity of the markets and public confidence in them is
our highest priority,'' Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's
executive committee, said at a news conference. ``If we falter in
this responsibility, we will lose the right of self-regulation.''
   Trading practices in the Chicago markets have come under severe
scrutiny from federal regulators and politicians since the
disclosure earlier this year of the 2{-year federal undercover
investigation that led to the indictments.
   Rule changes enacted and proposed by the markets _ which for the
most part regulate their own trading practices _ appear to be aimed
not only at cracking down on wrongdoing but also heading off
possibly tougher restrictions by lawmakers and regulators.
   One new rule adopted by the Merc calls for automatic expulsion
of any trader found guilty of a second offense involving a
customer's account.
   ``That's what we meant by putting the fear of God into the
membership,'' said Melamed.
   But the most significant rule change approved by the Merc's
Board of Governors requires membership approval. It would severely
limit dual trading, in which a trader is allowed to trade on his
own account as well as those of customers.
   That practice made possible many of the frauds alleged in the
indictments: pre-arranged trades; order crossing, in which a trader
crosses buy and sell orders rather than bring them to the
competitive auction process of the pit; and front-running, where a
trader trades on his own account in advance of a large customer
order, knowing the price of a commodity will rise or fall because
of the order following it.
   The Board of Trade issued a similar response late Wednesday,
proposing tougher regulations, penalties and surveillance measures.
   The indictments accused traders of systematically conspiring to
skim profits from customer accounts and attempting to hide earnings
from the Internal Revenue Service.
   In announcing the indictments, U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas
called the amount customers may have lost by fraud ``significant,''
but declined to specify the amount.
   Brokers trading for their own accounts as well as customers'
accounts were alleged to have routinely and illegally cheated
customers with the cooperation of ``locals'' _ traders who traded
only for their own accounts.
   Eighteen of the defendants were charged with violating the
federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations act, which
carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison. The law also
empowers the government to freeze defendants' assets before trial
for seizure upon conviction.
   Fourteen of those charged already have agreed to plead guilty
and cooperate with investigators, according to government sources
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Elf Aquitaine Offer For Pennwalt Expires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French oil giant Societe Nationale Elf
Aquitaine has ended its $132-a-share offer for Pennwalt Corp. after
purchasing 96 percent of the outstanding shares.
   Thursday's move comes three days after the companies reached an
agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that will permit the
completion of the $1.05 billion acquisition.
   Elf Aquitaine plans to merge Pennwalt, a pharmaceutical company,
with AC Development Inc., an Elf subsidiary in Stamford, Conn., the
companies said in a statement Thursday.
   Under the agreement with the FTC, Elf Aquitaine must sell a
4-year-old Pennwalt plant in Thorofare, N.J., where two chemicals _
polyvinylidene flouride and vinylidene flouride _ are produced. The
company will be allowed to keep a Pennwalt plant in Calvert City,
Ky., which produces the same chemicals.
   The chemicals, which Elf Aquitaine also produces, are used to
coat electrical wires, to line pipes in chemical plants and to coat
buildings.
   The FTC, which reviews takeovers for possible violations of
antitrust laws, originally planned to seek a court order preventing
the combination because it ``could substantially reduce competition
in the production and the sale'' of the two chemicals.
   In March, Philadelphia-based Pennwalt's management accepted the
offer from Elf Aquitaine, an energy and chemical company owned
largely by the French government. Elf's bid won out over a hostile
attempt by Centaur Partners, a New York investment group.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, Pennwalt
closed at $131.87{, up 12{ cents.

<TEXT>
   Convincing Mexicans to keep their
savings inside the country is essential for Mexico's economic
recovery, says President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Salinas inaugurated the Fifth National Banking Meeting here
Thursday with a plea to bankers to ``improve the quality of
attention that customers receive.''
   Increasing savings and providing credit to lower income groups
``is part of your responsibility,'' he told bankers.
   During the past few months Mexicans brought back $2.3 billion
deposited in foreign banks, helping to boost the country's foreign
reserves to $6 billion, said Miguel Mancera, general director of
the Bank of Mexico, the country's central bank.
   Mancera told the nearly 1,500 banking and government officials
from Mexico, the United States and other countries that the first
half of 1989 saw an ``abundant repatriation, lured by high interest
rates.''
   It is estimated that Mexicans have $28 billion in foreign banks,
mostly in the United States.
   To entice more people to bring back deposits, the government
announced this week a plan to only minimally tax repatriated funds.
   ``We Mexicans must finance our own development. We can
accomplish that by saving more and increasing income to the country
through exports of manufactured products,'' Salinas said.
   Mancera said Mexico's balance of payments showed a $585 million
deficit through July, which he called ``relatively modest
considering the circumstances.''
   Mexico paid out $600 million to service its public debt and $700
million on private debt service, he said.
   During the same period, Mancera said, net foreign direct
investments totaled $900 million.
   The two-day meeting, held for the second consecutive year in
this northern industrial capital, follows a July 23 accord between
Mexico and private bank creditors to restructure $54 billion of its
$107 billion foreign debt.

   The stock market lapsed into an erratic decline
today, responding to a stronger-than-expected report on the
employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .38 to 2,661.23
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 314 up, 724
down and 455 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.19 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the civilian
unemployment rate dropped to 5.2 percent in July from 5.3 percent
the month before.
   Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 169,000, on top of an
upward-revised 250,000 gain in June.
   The figures were interpreted as evidence of persistent strength
in the economy, suggesting that the Federal Reserve might see
little need to relax its credit policy further any time soon.
   Interest rates jumped in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds fell more than $10 for each $1,000 in face value,
pushing their yields back above 8 percent.

<HEAD>Toyota to End Use of CFCs by 1995</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automobile
manufacturer, said Friday it will stop using chlorofluorocarbons,
the gases blamed for destroying the Earth's protective ozone layer.
   Toyota spokesman Anthony McMillan said that by 1995, the company
will stop using the gas for cleaning and cooling during the
manufacturing process.
   Toyota used 2,800 tons of CFC during 1988, he said. The Toyota
group, which includes affiliated parts suppliers, used 9,500 tons
last year, McMillan said.
   Nippondenso Co., a major producer of electronic parts and a
member of the Toyota group, also has agreed to stop using CFC, he
said.
   Toyota's announcement follows decisions by Nissan Motor Co. and
Honda Motor Co, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers
respectively, to cease using the gas by the mid-1990s.
   The automobile industry consumes 14 percent of all CFC used in
Japan, auto makers say.
   At a meeting in 1987 in Montreal, Canada, 38 countries agreed to
reduce the production and use of the gases. Under the Montreal
Protocol, participating countries must freeze their CFC consumption
at the 1986 level by July 1 this year and reduce consumption to 5
percent of the 1986 level by the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Bank To Issue Credit Cards For Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank dedicated to young customers is offering
what it says is the first-ever credit card for children.
   Young Americans Bank introduced the new credit cards Thursday at
a party marking the institution's second anniversary.
   Like most credit cards, these have restrictions. Youngsters must
talk a parent or other adult into co-signing and guaranteeing
payment on their accounts.
   Although cardholders must be at least 12 years old and cannot
exceed a $100 credit limit, the bank will consider increasing
credit limits and lowering age requirements for particularly
creditworthy children, said Leanne Cadman, who heads the bank's
loan department.
   Otherwise, the MasterCards, issued by United Bank of Denver, are
just like mom's and dad's. Monthly statements will tell kids they
can make a minimum monthly payment or pay off the whole balance.
Interest will accrue on the balance at the annual rate of 18.8
percent, Cadman said.
   Young Americans Bank, a full-service, state-chartered and
federally insured bank, already offers checking accounts for
children 12 or older. In its two years of service, it has signed up
10,000 depositors.
   United Bank of Denver officials were on hand Thursday to counsel
young applicants about using credit cars.
   ``We tell them they need to use credit cards with care and not
to abuse them,'' Cadman said. ``And of course, we impress on them
that whatever you charge you have to pay back.''
   The bank was founded two years ago by Denver cable executive
Bill Daniels.

   Turner's all-news Cable News Network said it has completed a

   The satellite, positioned over the Indian Ocean, complements
satellites that broadcast the network to South America, Europe and

   Haworth said CNN also is working on a deal with the Soviets to

<HEAD>Market Leaves Auto Stocks Behind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many other stocks have reached or
approached new highs of late, shares of the Big Three U.S. auto
manufacturers have faced trouble getting into gear.
   Ford Motor Co., for example, traded late last week around $50,
down from the peak of $56.75 it reached early this year.
   Chrysler Corp., in the neighborhood of $24, is going for barely
half its 1987 high of $48. And General Motors Corp., even with a
recent spurt from the low $40s to $45, remains short of its
early-1989 high of $47.37.
   The group's laggard behavior is no puzzle to followers of the
industry's fortunes. Car sales have been weak for some time now,
and production plans have been cut repeatedly for the remainder of
the year.
   Indeed, when Wall Street economists argue that the economy is
headed for a recession, the state of the auto industry is usually
one of the first pieces of evidence they cite.
   ``The weakness in the auto market has been quite obvious for
months in disappointing car sales,'' said Kathleen Heaney, an
analyst who follows the industry for Nikko Securities International
in New York.
   ``As a result, the earnings of the Big Three will begin to
reflect the strain.''
   Some observers say the industry is paying a price for the
marketing innovations that helped sell so many cars from the
mid-1980s through last year _ sales incentives such as rebates and
cut-rate financing, and auto loans stretching out for periods as
long as five years.
   When consumers go shopping to replace cars bought with four- or
five-year loans, they often find themselves with little equity in
them to use toward a down payment on a new vehicle.
   ``Incentives are now the bane of every automaker selling cars in
the U.S.,'' Heaney says.
   ``Automakers have discovered that while they can no longer sell
cars without some type of incentive, this year they are learning
that they can't even sell cars with incentives.''
   Those problems aside, many analysts argue that the industry was
due for an inevitable down stage in its business cycle.
   The long-term trend is for growth of the American car and truck
fleet at about 1.3 percent a year, the Value Line Investment Survey
says in its latest quarterly report on the industry.
   From 1984 through 1988, the advisory service says, sales of
vehicles surpassed that level, using up a lot of demand. ``We
expect that unit sales comparisons will be negative through most of
1989,'' wrote Value Line's Mark Leach.
   All that doesn't mean, however, that everyone on Wall Street is
down on the auto stocks. ``Viewed from a long-term perspective,''
Leach said, ``industry fundamentals don't look all that bad.
   ``The quality of domestically produced vehicles continues to
rise and operating costs are being reduced, all of which should
ultimately lift earnings.''
   Philip Fricke, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, has
just raised his ratings of the Big Three stocks.
   ``We think the stocks are already discounting a severe sales and
earnings decline next year which we don't think will happen,'' he
said.
   ``The stocks tend to begin to outperform when the news
background is bad, when interest rates have peaked and are headed
down, and when a cyclical trough is in sight. Our call may be
early, but we think the greater risk is missing the move up.''
   Says Heaney: ``Although the outlook for the next year is not
optimistic, we would be looking for an opportunity to buy these
stocks.''

<TEXT>
   The federal government has yet to buy a
single apple under its $15 million bailout of the Alar-plagued
industry, but its emergency program is already a rousing success in
the orchards.
   The market for apples has improved so dramatically in the past
month that there is speculation there will not be a surplus even if
the government fails to buy any apples. There could even be
shortages.
   Retailers and industry officials credit the federal buyout plan
announced July 7 with restoring consumer confidence in apples,
which jumped 20 percent in sales and as much as 50 percent in
wholesale price last month.
   ``The increase in sales is because of the added reassurance to
the public,'' said Vicky Sanders, a spokeswoman for Vons Cos., a
chain of 342 food stores based in El Monte, Calif.
   ``The federal government is saying that apples are safe, and I
think it has had an effect on consumers,'' said Robert Keeney, an
administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service of U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which runs the program.
   While the buyout already has had the desired effect of
increasing sales and prices, the Agriculture Department has no
intention of halting planned purchases, Keeney said from Washington
D.C.
   ``If we don't go ahead, it would have an adverse effect on the
marketplace, and we would certainly lose credibility with the
industry,'' Keeney said.
   Recent statistics indicate the government's plan to purchase as
many as 2 million 42-pound boxes of apples is unnecessary.
   In the past three weeks, Washington growers have shipped 2.7
million boxes of apples out of state. Washington grows half the
nation's apples but has about 90 percent of the remaining U.S.
warehouse supply.
   There were just 3.5 million boxes of apples left in the state's
warehouses as of Aug. 1, and if sales continued at the same rate as
in July, the entire surplus would be gone by the end of this month
just as havesting of the 1989 crop begins.
   But Tom Hale, president of the Washington State Apple
Commission, said it is wrong to assume that sales will remain so
hat high in August when there is considerable competition from
other fruits.
   ``To expect that we could sell that volume in August would be
fantasy land,'' said Hale, noting such sales would break records
for the month.
   The average sales in August for the past six years have been 1.9
million boxes, said Walt Shields of the Yakima Valley
Growers-Shippers Association.
   The industry became worried this summer when warehouse
inventories climbed to twice the norm as concern over Alar
depressed sales.
   Industry leaders aggressively pursued the federal apple purchase
as a way to clean out warehouses and boost prices that had fallen
below the cost of production.
   ``The market was headed for a black hole and this probably
prevented it from going into the black hole,'' said Derl Derr,
president of the International Apple Institute in McLean, Va.,
which represents many of the 20,000 growers in the nation's $1
billion apple industry.
   Under the program, apples and apple juice will be shipped to
charitable organizations, with the government reimbursing
warehouses for the fruit.
   Keeney said 56 apple warehouses offered apples to the buyout
program by Wednesday. Under the program, warehouses offer a certain
number of apples and name a price. The government will not pay more
than $8.20 per box.
   An announcement on exactly how many apples the government will
buy and how much it will spend will come Tuesday, Keeney said.
   The industry's troubles were created by the Alar controversy
that began in February when a consumer group said eating apples
treated with the growth regulator increased cancer risk in
children. That report by the Natural Resources Defense Council has
been disputed, but its impact on the market was undeniable.
   Prices for the top grade of red apples fell to $8 per box. But
since the government announcement, they have risen to between $10
and $12 per box, prices well above the ceiling of $8.20 the
government intends to pay.

<HEAD>Hoosier Finds Buckwheat a Hot Commodity Among Japanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH HARRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerald LeMaster has never visited Japan,
but this year 75 percent of his income will come from growing
buckwheat used to make Japanese pasta.
   Through a contract with a Japanese trading association, LeMaster
directs the processing and shipment of Midwest-grown buckwheat,
including a crop from his own farm in Indiana.
   He is one of a small group of American brokers with contracts to
produce buckwheat for the Japanese. His one-year deal with the
Buckwheat Millers Association to produce 22,000 acres in Indiana
and Ohio will pay him $9 per 100 pounds.
   It's a growing business. Last year, just 25 percent of his
income came from buckwheat production.
   The Japanese consume about 250,000 tons of buckwheat a year,
mostly in the form of a noodle called soba, a staple in their diet.
   Soba is made from a mixture of 30 percent to 50 percent
buckwheat flour and hard red wheat flour.
   ``They tell me buckwheat flour has more protein, it's a sweeter
flour and gives it an added flavor,'' LeMaster said in an interview
on his farm near Portland, a rural community about 100 miles
northeast of Indianapolis.
   LeMaster started growing buckwheat almost as an afterthought in
1981 when rain threatened to keep him from planting 600 acres of
soybeans.
   ``I just thought we'd feed it to livestock if nothing else,'' he
said. ``But we started marketing it to some flour mills.''
   Buckwheat is an attractive crop to farmers because of its short
growing time and ability to produce a better crop on poor soils,
LeMaster said.
   Its white flowers bloom four to six weeks after planting in
mid-July and the crop matures in about 10 weeks. A farmer's
investment is typically $20-$30 an acre, LeMaster said.
   ``We're not competing with any of the other crops,'' LeMaster
said. ``Not only is it a profit to farmers, it enhances the soil
the following year.''
   As a protein source, nutritionists say, buckwheat is nearly
unbeatable, and unlike other crops, it's mostly free of chemicals.
   Two-thirds of the buckwheat used in Japan is produced in China,
but the recent civil unrest there has caused the Japanese to search
for alternate suppliers, LeMaster said.
   In Canada, a large buckwheat producer, the government subsidizes
freight costs, but the country's cold weather has hurt crops.
   ``The only reason we're getting it instead of them is because we
have a lot less chance of losing a whole crop,'' LeMaster said.
   ``Down here, we're just about guaranteed of a crop every year.
Since 1981, we've only had one year where we've had a total failure
and we were delayed over 45 days at harvest.''
   LeMaster expresses pride in his family run farm, which employs a
handful of outsiders. A Rolex watch on his arm and a seldom-used
pleasure boat in his yard are evidence of LeMaster's success.
   He said he wants to see buckwheat qualify for the federal export
enhancement program, which provides support to make certain crops
more competitive in foreign markets.
   ``We can be more competitive in price, still maintain a good
price to our farmers and we'd probably be looking at 80,000 acres
through the Corn Belt region,'' he said.
   LeMaster said he's been working with representatives of the
Buckwheat Millers Association and the other American brokers to
arrange a meeting with Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh to discuss export
enhancement and crop insurance.
   ``We tell all of our growers how important it is to keep the
buckwheat clean and free from other grains because if we want their
business we have to maintain a high standard of quality,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's unemployment rate fell one notch
to 5.2 percent in July as businesses added 169,000 new jobs despite
the slowing economy, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department said the growth was again found
predominantly in the service-producing sector of the economy, which
added 140,000 of the new jobs.
   The civilian joblessness rate declined from the 5.3 percent
reported for June. The government also revised its figures on new
jobs created in June to 250,000, up sharply from the 180,000
reported last month.
   ``We have a soft economy but one that appears to have been
stronger in July than in May and June,'' said chief economist Allen
Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. ``This certainly should
ease fears of imminent recession.''
   Michael Boskin, the Bush administration's top economic adviser,
said the report ``suggests the economy is continuing to expand.''
He said the July job growth brought to 20 million the number of new
jobs created during the record-long expansion, which began in late
1982.
   Today's report contained further evidence of persistent wage
inflation.
   The department said hourly earnings of production and
nonsupervisory workers increased 0.8 percent in July _ about twice
the rate analysts had predicted _ while average weekly earnings
climbed by 1.7 percent. The jump in hourly earnings followed two
months of modest increases.
   Goods-producing industries added 29,000 new positions as
construction posted a gain of 35,000 jobs, helping to offset a
decline of more than 10,000 jobs in the automobile industry.
   Manufacturing posted a modest gain of 3,000 jobs last month
after three months of declines, according to the Labor Department's
survey of business establishments.
   In all, 117.4 million Americans were at work in non-farm jobs
last month, the government said.
   The average work week for production and nonsupervisory
employees in private industry increased by 0.3 hours, to 34.9
hours. The factory work week held steady at 41 hours and overtime
in July averaged 3.9 hours a week, up from 3.8 hours in June, the
Labor Department said.
   The jump in hourly earnings brought average hourly pay in the
private sector to $9.70 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from
$9.62 in June.
   Weekly earnings rose to an average of $338.53 from the June
average of $332.85.
   The government said the summer expansion of the youth labor
force in the past four months has totaled about 3.1 million, about
the same as recent years despite a significant drop in the youth
population.
   The unemployment rate fell last month despite a dip in the
number of Americans at work from 117.5 million to 117.4 million.
The rate fell because the 169,000 new jobs were created in a month
in which the civilian labor force _ the number of people who have
jobs or are looking for them _ fell by 146,000.
   Evidence of a number of recent economic developments could be
found in today's unemployment report, the first comprehensive look
at the economy's performance in July.
   The data showed employment in the mining industry fell by 11,000
jobs _ the result of a coal strike in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky that also has led to wildcat walkouts in other
coal-producing states.
   The rebound in construction coincides with reports showing a
upswing in housing starts and home sales.
   And the decline in auto manufacturing follows recent
announcements by major automakers that they are cutting production
bacause of sluggish sales.
   The 140,000 job growth in the service-producing sector came
despite a 25,000 drop in the number of government jobs.
   Elsewhere in that sector, retail trade added 52,000 jobs,
wholesale trade 5,000, transportation and public utilities 23,000
and finance, insurance and real estate 11,000. Employment in
services was up by 74,000 positions and both business and health
services posted modest gains, the government said.
   The payroll and wage data is taken from the Labor Department's
survey of businesses. A separate household survey found few major
shifts in unemployment among demographic groups, although
joblessness among black teen-agers fell to 33.1 percent last month
from 40.2 percent in June. The June total was up sharply from 28.4
percent in May.
   For white adult men, the unemployment rate was 3.8 percent last
month, up from 3.7 percent in June. Among adult white women, the
rate rose from 4.1 percent to 4.3 percent.
   Unemployment among white teen-agers was 13.4 percent, up from
12.6 percent in June.
   Among blacks, the overall jobless rate was 10.9 percent, down
from 11.9 percent in June. Unemployment fell from 9.4 percent to
9.3 percent for adult black men and from 10.5 percent to 9.9
percent among black women.
   The government said 9 percent of Hispanics in the civilian labor
force were unemployed in July, up from 8.1 percent in June.
   A separate calculation of unemployment that includes members of
the armed services stationed in the United States was also 5.2
percent in July, unchanged from June.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., under pressure from its
bankers, today cut its bid for Prime Computer Inc. by $74 million
to $1.18 billion, and Prime accepted the new offer.
   The New York venture capital firm said it will pay $20 a share
for the outstanding common stock of Natick-based Prime, down from
its previous offer of $21.50 a share.
   After Prime reported a $19 million quarterly loss last week,
Whitney came under pressure from its main financing sources _ Bank
of Boston and Chemical Bank _ to line up additional funds to ensure
that it could ride out a period of continued losses.
   Whitney said Thursday it had been unable to obtain the
additional financing at $21.50 per share and was entering
negotiations with Prime to reduce the offer.
   Don E. Ackerman, a Whitney partner, said today Whitney has
informed Prime that ``our financing sources have furnished us
financing commitments at $20 per share.''
   In a statement, Prime Chairman David J. Dunn said, ``The board
of directors of Prime is very disappointed that J.H. Whitney and
its financial sources have not completed the $21.50 per share offer
agreed to in the original merger agreement.''
   However, Dunn said, the board believed the amended Whitney offer
remained economically superior to a competing offer from MAI Basic
Four Inc. of Tustin, Calif., and recommended that Prime
shareholders accept it.
   Prime, a manufacturer of minicomputers and computer-aided design
and manufacturing systems, last month agreed to merge with Whitney
while fending off the hostile bid from MAI.
   MAI, a computer firm controlled by New York investor Bennett S.
LeBow, had originally offered $20 a share for Prime but cut its
offer on June 1 to $19.50 a share.
   Whitney's new offer of $20 a share applies to Prime's 49.5
million outstanding common shares, which represent about 79 percent
of the company's stock on a fully-diluted basis. Whitney has
offered to exchange securities with a face value of $22 per share
for the remaining 21 percent of Prime's shares.

   Stock prices surged Friday in heavy trading with
the key British index closing at a new high for this year.
   Strong investor interest in insurance and pharmaceutical stocks,
combined with news of a sweetened $1.5 billion offer by Boots Co.
PLC for Ward White Group PLC, underscored the market's rise.
   Dealers said investors interpreted the renewal of speculative
interest as an excuse to push prices higher, thus giving a
technical twist to the market's rise.
   ``There's no real selling pressure at all because people are
afraid of being left out when the market makes its next move
forward,'' one dealer said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
21.2 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,327.5.

close at 1,312.74.
   Volume totaled a robust 731.4 million shares Friday, compared
with 550.1 million shares Thursday.

   The stock market headed lower today, responding
to a stronger-than-expected report on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.09 to
2,648.52 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 531 up, 931 down and
481 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate dropped to 5.2 percent in July from 5.3
percent the month before.
   Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 169,000, on top of an
upward-revised 250,000 gain in June.
   The figures were interpreted as evidence of persistent strength
in the economy, suggesting that the Federal Reserve might see
little need to relax its credit policy further any time soon.
   Interest rates jumped in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds fell more than $15 for each $1,000 in face value,
pushing their yields back above 8 percent.
   The reaction in the stock market was less clear-cut, however.
While the news was a negative for interest rates, brokers said, it
also helped to ease recent worries about a possible recession.
   Walt Disney fell 3~ to 117[ after climbing 6] points Thursday.

<HEAD>Brown Suits Are Staging A Minor Comeback, Minus Spats</HEAD>

   Call it the latest summer brownout.
   Brown suits are making a fresh appearance this year, minus the
two-tone shoes and natty hats, spats and cravats that your
grandfather wore with them.
   Clothiers say the modern brown suit is subtler than its ancestor
and usually has a strong tinge of blue or gray, the official colors
of the corporate office.
   About 5 percent of Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx's men's suits this year
are in brown or olive shades and that share could double in 1990,
according to Robert E. Bruno, executive vice president.
   Last year, Bruno said, sales were ``minuscule.''
   Similar increases are being posted by Greif Cos., whose suit
lines include Perry Ellis and Chaps by Ralph Lauren, and Joseph &amp;
Feiss Co., maker of Cricketeer suits.
   Theories for the trend range from the influence of European
fashion to nostalgia for military uniforms to attempts by the
clothing industry to drum up sales with a new look.
   Chocolate brown suits are still very out, despite a blip in
sales after Ronald Reagan wore them.
   What's in is taupe, a chameleon-like brownish gray that can
range from pale to charcoal, from reddish to bluish to greenish.
   ``Brown is coming back,'' said Rick Pallack, a clothier to the
stars in Sherman Oaks, Calif., whose clients include talk show host
Pat Sajak.
   ``Basically brown's never been an important color in this
country. But taupe, with off shades of different colorations, that
could be big, if the retailer gets behind it,'' said Jack Bier,
vice president of Greif Cos.
   Clothing manufacturers are disarmingly frank about their
attempts to engineer interest in browns and olives to increase
sales.
   ``We're trying to stimulate the business by obsoleting last
year's designs,'' said Bruno, of Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx.
   Jeffrey M. Moriber was spotted recently on Manhattan's
fashionable 57th Street wearing a good-looking suit.
   ``I would say it has a brown cast with blue influence,'' said
Moriber, creative director of a public relations agency. ``I like
it because it has a subtle pattern. It can go either way. It has
blue tones as well as warm tones.''
   Dressing advice books say a man in a brown suit won't be taken
seriously, but taupe may be another matter. Its peculiar beauty is
that no one can quite describe it.
   Webster's Third New International Dictionary says taupe comes
from the Latin talpa, for mole, and calls it ``a brownish gray that
is paler and slightly yellower than chocolate, duller and slightly
redder than mouse gray, and duller and slightly redder than
castor.''
   ``We started seeing it about five years ago,'' said Rick White,
a salesman at The Tailored Man in San Francisco. ``It can have a
green cast or an olive cast or a purple cast. ... It's hard to
define.''
   For fall and winter, taupe will carry on in its darker tones, as
a thread or accent color in a pinstripe, windowpane or subtle plaid
suit, said Tom Julian, associate fashion director of the Men's
Fashion Association of America.
   Europeans have always used a bigger palette of colors in men's
suits, and that influence is crossing the Atlantic. But the most
interesting theory on the popularity of brown and olive is the
military one.
   ``Men get a little leery of wearing things like taupes and
olives when they just get out of the military. Right after World
War II or the Korean conflict or the Vietnam War you couldn't give
away colors like that,'' said Sue Smyth, vice president for
communications at Joseph &amp; Feiss.
   Now that the nation has been at peace for some time, the bad
feelings are gone, she said. ``There may even be some nostalgia.''
   Still, navy and gray are entrenched.
   ``You can't push a man that quickly,'' said Bier of Greif Cos.
``He's not in the same category as women. We only made that mistake
once in our business and that's with the Nehru jacket.''

<HEAD>Bush Endorses Agreement on Savings and Loan Bailout</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 3-11 pvs, House leaders, with 7 new grafs to UPDATE
with three House Committee chairmen opposing compromise.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today endorsed a compromise on
his $159 billion savings and loan bailout, lifting a veto threat
after White House and congressional negotiators struck a deal in a
late-night bargaining session.
   ``This legislation has been developed in a bipartisan process.
It is badly needed, and must be enacted without further delay,''
Bush said in a letter to congressional leaders. ``I ask that the
House and Senate approve this legislation today.''
   House leaders scrambled to muster enough Republican votes to
compensate for defecting Democrats unhappy with the pact. Opposing
the deal were three influential committee chairmen, Reps. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., of the Ways and Means Committee; John D.
Dingell, D-Mich., of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., of the Budget Committee.
   The Senate planned to vote on the deal first, with leaders
expecting passage by a wide margin. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., said despite opposition within his own party he was
pushing for enactment in time to allow Congress to leave for its
summer vacation at the end of the day.
   ``I think this bill needs to be passed,'' Foley said. ``This is
a compromise that we didn't prefer to make, but because the
president has been adamant ... we had to deal with that.''
   Aides said they had collected signatures from 28 of the 55 House
delegates to a conference committee that worked out the compromise
late Thursday night with help from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady and Budget Director Richard Darman.
   That was just enough to move the plan to the House floor, but
there were other procedural hurdles to be overcome before the House
could act today.
   Foley said the compromise plan for financing the bailout will
cost more than the method originally proposed by Democrats. But, he
added, ``If we delay it or defeat it, that will cost money.''
   The compromise would cost each American taxpayer an average
total of $1,000 over 30 years.
   The administration and Congress long ago agreed on the most
important elements of the landmark bill, which will close or merge
hundreds of insolvent savings institutions hemorrhaging losses at
an estimated $20 million a day.
   It also contains a series of what Bush labeled ``never again''
provisions designed to prevent the recurrence of what analysts
describe as the worst financial crisis since the wave of bank
failures in the 1930s.
   In the key reform, savings and loan owners will be required to
raise billions of dollars of their own capital to discourage risky
investments and act as a cushion between future losses and
government deposit insurance funds.
   Thrift institutions will be channeled back into home mortgage
lending and away from speculative commercial real estate ventures
and high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
   The bill also gives the Justice Department $75 million a year to
root out fraud at financial institutions, permits banks for the
first time to buy healthy institutions in the rival thrift
industry, and enacts the most sweeping restructuring of the
regulatory bureaucracy in five decades.
   The agency overseeing S&amp;Ls, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
will be dismantled, with one piece wrapped into the Treasury
Department and the other coming under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures commercial bank deposits.
   While taxpayers will bear most of the bailout, the savings
industry also is contributing through higher deposit insurance
premiums.
   A dispute between the White House and congressional Democrats
over how to account for the taxpayer funds was the last snag.
   Shrugging off a morning veto threat, the House at midday
Thursday voted 221-199 to approve the legislation with its own
financing plan. But by evening, the bill bogged down in the Senate.
   Senators voted 54-46 in favor of the House financing proposal,
but fell six votes short of the 60-vote majority required under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   That sent the bill to a House-Senate conference, which after 2{
hours of talks endorsed a compromise offered by four of the five
Senate delegates.
   Thursday night's compromise was a hybrid of two conflicting
plans to evade automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.
Democrats wanted to avoid the cuts by waiving the law.
   The Bush administration would have borrowed rescue money through
a private agency, keeping the spending out of the budget.
   The compromise calls for raising $20 billion this year along the
lines Democrats had suggested, ballooning the 1989 deficit from an
estimated $148 billion to $168 billion, the highest in three years.
However, spending cuts would not be triggered because the deadline
for meeting spending targets has passed.
   The remaining $30 billion would be borrowed ``off-budget'' in
1990 and 1991 as Bush wanted and will not show up in the deficit.
   Darman questioned whether regulators could spend $20 billion
before the end of the 1989 fiscal year on Sept. 30, but he called
the compromise ``conceptually sound.''

<HEAD>Soybeans Lead End-of-the-Week Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from a week-long
string of losses as traders evened up their positions ahead of the
weekend.
   Grain futures also advanced, partly in sympathy with soybeans
and partly in reaction to a private crop-production estimate
pegging the 1989 corn and soybean harvests slightly below the
Agriculture Department's latest projections.
   Soybeans for delivery in August had fallen a total of more than
85 cents a bushel in the five previous sessions as growing
conditions improved and supplies of newly harvested South American
soybeans increased.
   ``This rally was long overdue,'' said Walter Spilka,
grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New
York. ``The market was oversold technically and it was just a
matter of which day it would fall on.''
   He said many traders typically even up their positions on Friday
so they have no risk exposure over the weekend. Some of those who
had sold at higher prices earlier in the week may have been buyers
on Friday.
   Another bullish factor was a report Thursday on crop production
estimates by Sparks Commodities Inc., a private analytical firm
based in Memphis, Tenn.
   A financial news service reported that Sparks had pegged the
1989 U.S. soybean harvest at 1.9 billion bushels and the corn crop
at 7.3 billion bushels. Sparks would not confirm the report.
   Both reported estimates were slightly below the Agriculture
Department's latest predictions. The USDA will issue new harvest
projections in a crop report due out on Thursday.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to } cent higher with
September at $3.87\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2} cents higher
with September at $2.19} a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4} cents
higher with September at $1.40\ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to
16{ cents higher with August at $5.91 a bushel.

<HEAD>Former Football Star Expresses Concern on Eastern to Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro football Hall of Famer Roger Staubach has
joined the lineup of those backing Eastern Airlines strikers,
writing a letter to President Bush saying that continued sales of
Eastern assets could bring the airline's eventual demise.
   In a letter to Bush dated Aug. 1, the former Dallas Cowboys
quarterback asked that a meeting be set up as soon as possible
between representatives of the Eastern pilots union and Roger
Porter, Bush's domestic policy adviser.
   Staubach wrote that his interest in the airline stemmed from
personal relationships with many striking Eastern pilots. He said
that group includes the best man at his wedding, football teammates
and classmates at the U.S. Naval Academy, where Staubach also was a
quarterback.
   From his conversations with those friends and from ``all other
accounts,'' Staubach wrote, ``it is obvious that the Eastern
situation is far more than a traditional labor-management dispute.
It goes to the very root of the free enterprise system within our
country.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said he had no comment
on Staubach's letter or speculation that the former football player
might get involved in making a buyout offer for the company.
   Staubach, who now runs a commercial real estate company in
Dallas, didn't return a call seeking comment Friday. It wasn't
immediately clear whether Staubach's interest in Eastern could
extend to a possible bid for the crippled airline.
   Another sports figure, former baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth, made a buyout bid for Eastern in partnership with the
unions in early April. But the takeover agreement between Ueberroth
and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
later fell apart over the unions' demand that Lorenzo be removed
from daily control of the airline.
   Eastern pilots, Machinists union members and flight attendants
are in the sixth month of a strike against the Miami-based company,
which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors since March 9.
   The company is reorganizing as a smaller carrier, selling $1.8
billion in aircraft, landing slots and other assets, and hiring new
pilots to replace the strikers.
   Eastern's unions support an alternative buyout proposal by
Joseph Ritchie, a Chicago businessman who has met at the White
House with high-level members of the Bush administration.
   On Thursday, the master executive council of Eastern's pilots
union passed a resolution calling for pilots at carriers nationwide
to undertake a temporary work stoppage to pressure Congress to
investigate Lorenzo's fitness to run Eastern and its sister
carrier, Continental Airlines.

   The dollar rose nearly 2 percent Friday against
major foreign currencies, its biggest gain in months, after a
government report upset expectations of an economic slowdown.
   The dollar's rally was the mirror image of a debacle in the bond
market. The selling binge in bonds drove interest yields higher and
made the dollar-denominated securities more attractive to global
investors.
   Gold prices fell in U.S. trading after finishing higher overseas.
   The dollar remained well below the peaks reached in June in
spite of its one-day surge, which amounted to 1.9 percent against
the West German mark, British pound and Japanese yen and an even 2
percent vs. the Swiss franc.
   The Labor Department triggered the rally by announcing that
nonfarm payrolls rose by 169,000 in July.
   Although the figure was consistent with economists' predictions,
many traders had been betting that payroll growth would be much
smaller. Also, the department revised upward the figure for June
job growth.
   The job statistics renewed fears of inflation, which hurts the
value of interest-paying securities. As a result bond prices fell
and their yields shot up.
   The higher yields on bonds and short-term securities attracted
money into dollars, said Marc Cohen, a vice president at Republic
National Bank of New York.
   Also helping the dollar was heightened tension in the Middle
East, Cohen said. The dollar widely is seen as a safe haven from
political turmoil.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.05 yen, up 1.65 yen from
Thursday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 139.40 yen. In
New York the dollar rose to 139.85 yen from 137.20 yen late
Thursday.
   In London, the dollar jumped against the British pound, with
sterling falling to $1.6150 from $1.6475 late Thursday. In New York
the pound fell to $1.6060 from $1.6373.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.9070 West German marks, up from
1.8718; 1.6435 Swiss francs, up from 1.6115; 1.1783 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1733; 6.4555 French francs, up from 6.3395; and
1,370.50 Italian lire, up from 1,348.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.8975 West German marks, up from 1.8650; 1.6353 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6065; 6.4260 French francs, up from 6.3192;
2.1300 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0950; 1,366.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,338.00, and 1.1775 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1715.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $372.86 a troy ounce, up $2.19 from
Thursday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $370.75 a troy ounce, from
$369.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to close at a bid of
$370.50 from $369.50 an ounce Thursday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $367.25 an ounce from $373.30. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $367.50, down from
$372.25.
   Silver bullion prices held steady on the London market, where
the metal was trading at a late bid of $5.23 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Thursday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.168 from $5.296 on Thursday.

   The stock market retreated Friday as a
stronger-than-expected report on employment sent interest rates
sharply higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.16 to
2,653.45, trimming its gain for the week to 18.21 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
642 up, 867 down and 492 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate dropped to 5.2 percent in July from 5.3
percent the month before.
   Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 169,000, on top of an
upward-revised 250,000 gain in June.
   The figures were interpreted as evidence of persistent strength
in the economy, suggesting that the Federal Reserve might see
little need to relax its credit policy further any time soon.
   Interest rates jumped in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds fell more than $20 for each $1,000 in face value,
driving their yields back above 8 percent.
   The reaction in the stock market was less emphatic, however.
While the news was a negative for interest rates, brokers said, it
also helped to ease recent worries about a possible recession.
   Thus, numerous stocks of companies in industries closely tied to
the ups and downs of the business cycle, such as metals, chemicals
and forest products, actually gain ground.
   Phelps Dodge rose 2} to 69~; Alcoa ~ to 71{; Dow Chemical 1\ to
93; Amax 1| to 26{; International Paper 1] to 54\, and Monsanto 1\
to 117.
   Walt Disney fell 4~ to 116[ in active trading after climbing 6]
points Thursday. Some analysts expressed skepticism about recent
takeover talk involving the company.
   Other losers among the blue chips included McDonald's, down \ at
29}; Coca-Cola, down 1\ at 65~, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
down ] at 39}.
   Bolar Pharmaceutical, the most active issue on the American
Stock Exchange, tumbled 4} to 23. Investigators in Congress said
Thursday they had received information suggesting that Bolar used a
Smithkline Beecham blood-pressure drug in getting approval to
market a generic version of the product.
   Bolar denied the allegations.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 169.75 million
shares, against 168.69 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 201.56 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $6.05 billion, or 0.18
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .45 to 191.64.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .48 to 393.14, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .82 at 343.92.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.49 to 457.42, setting a record high for the second straight day.
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at
376.10, down .72.

   Crude oil futures sank lower Friday but the
near-month contract failed to pierce the $18 level on the way down.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
fell 18 cents to finish at $18.03 a barrel. The contract traded at
a low of $18 during the session.
   Contracts for delivery in October and November were down 21
cents each to $17.70 and $17.66 respectively.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
for September fell 0.42 cent to 50.24 cents a gallon, while other
contracts closed mixed. Heating oil for September delivery edged up
0.6 cent to close at 49.18 cents a gallon. Most other contract
months were lower.
   Traders said volume was extremely light in an uneventful session.
   ``There was not a lot going on,'' said John H. O'Connell, energy
broker for Refco Inc. in New York.
   Most of the concern about possible oil supply disruptions from
the Middle East have subsided, analysts said. Worry about political
events involving the U.S. hostages had given prices some support
earlier in the week.
   ``Now that the Middle East is out of the way, the market is
bearish,'' O'Connell said.
   Weak gasoline prices due to excess refinery output and an
increase in OPEC production have softened crude prices in recent
weeks.

<HEAD>Merger Will Increase Amount Of Gold From American Girl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boise-based Morrison Knudsen Corp. has
entered into a joint venture with a British Columbia company to
develop a gold mine in southeastern California, MK Chairman William
Agee announced.
   MK said Friday it will enter into an equal partnership with
Eastmaque Gold Mines Ltd. of Vancouver to own, develop and operate
the American Girl gold mine now held by Eastmaque.
   MK will purchase 500,000 common shares from Eastmaque for $5 per
share U.S., contribute $10 million to the venture and assume
certain obligations.
   ``By acquiring an equity position in a productive gold mine we
have advanced a key goal in our mining strategy. Our owner's
position is a sensible expansion in an industry we know well
through 40 years' experience as a contract miner,'' Agee said.
   The mine currently produces 2,000 ounces of gold per month. With
improvements made this summer, it could increase the yield to about
3,200 ounces a month. When the mine is in full production next May,
it should come up with 6,000 ounces of gold each month, MK said.
   MK is an international engineering, mining and construction
company with 15,000 employees and annual revenue of about $2
billion.

<HEAD>Younger Gallo Denied Re-Trial In Trademark Dispute With Brothers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The younger brother of winemaking giants
Ernest and Julio Gallo has been denied a new trial in a trademark
dispute that bars him from using the Gallo name to sell cheese.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle ruled Friday that his
association with a law firm that once represented the Gallo Winery
is not a conflict of interest, and that there is insufficient
evidence to warrant a new trial.
   The elder Gallos sued the brother they raised after he began
using the family name to sell cheese in the mid 1980s.
   In his June 20 ruling, Coyle denied Joseph Gallo use of his full
name as a trademark because consumers confused it with the famous E
&amp; J Gallo Winery. The ruling allows Joseph Gallo to use his name as
a signature or in block letters if the label contains a prominent
trademark without the Gallo name.
   A lawyer for Joseph Gallo, Joseph Yanny, argued in the retrial
motion that his client didn't get a fair trial because Coyle's law
firm represented Gallo Winery in a 1983 trademark dispute with
Gallo Salame of San Francisco.
   Coyle wrote in the decision that lawyers representing Joseph
Gallo knew of his association with the law firm, and hadn't
objected when he was assigned the Gallo cheese case.
   Coyle said he doesn't remember the earlier case, which was
settled before he became a district judge.
   Yanny also argued that the original ruling denied Gallo his
freedom of ``commercial speech'' as protected by the First
Amendment. But Coyle ruled that those arguments had been covered in
the trial.

<HEAD>Checchi Completes Buyout of Northwest Airlines Parent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi signed
the acquisition papers Friday to complete his group's $3.65 billion
buyout of NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines.
   The 41-year-old former Marriott Corp. treasurer said all
publicly held shares of NWA common stock have been purchased for
$121 each, officially ending the takeover battle initiated by
Checchi in late March.
   Checchi has said he will spend some of his time at NWA's Eagan,
Minn., headquarters but will not take a management position. Steven
Rothmeier will stay on as the company's chief executive officer and
chairman while Checchi will become a board member, a spokesman for
the airline said.
   As a result of the takeover, Moody's Investors Service announced
Friday it has lowered the senior debt ratings of NWA to Single-B1
from BAA2, and of Northwest to BA2 from Single-A3. About $400
million of long-term debt is affected, the credit rating agency
said.
   Checchi's group, described early on by Rothmeier as a friendly
suitor, beat out at least three other bidders: rival airline Pan Am
Corp.; the 20,000-member Machinists union local at Northwest; and
Los Angeles oil billionaire Marvin Davis, who started the public
bidding with an offer of $2.7 billion, or $90 a share, on March 28.
   Checchi, who once worked for the Bass brothers of Fort Worth,
Texas, financed the takeover with $700 million cash and another
$3.35 billion in financing from commercial banks led by Bankers
Trust Co. Equity partners include KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Elders Finance Group of Australia, neither of which are allowed a
controlling interest under laws that limit foreign investment in
U.S. airlines.
   The deal did not require government approval, but Checchi's
group will need an operating permit from the U.S. Transportation
Department, which is conducting a financial fitness review of the
new owners. Checchi has said it is ``laughable'' to think that the
permit would be withheld.
   He acquires an airline in the midst of tense contract talks with
its 5,000 pilots. The pilots have been without a contract for about
2{ years and have asked the National Mediation Board to declare an
impasse in the negotiations. If the request is granted, the pilots
would be free to strike legally after a 30-day ``cooling-off''
period.
   Checchi is depending on a steady cash flow to service the large
takeover debt and a pilots' strike could idle the carrier.
   Checchi also inherits an airline that earned the nickname
``Northworst'' after a prolonged performance slump that followed
the 1986 purchase of Republic Airlines. The carrier has vastly
improved its service, however, and earnings are on the rise.
   After posting record earnings in 1988 of $135 million, or $4.63
a share, NWA is positioned to surpass that mark. It earned $83.3
million, or $2.82 a share, in the first six months of this year.
   Of the 21.2 billion revenue passenger miles logged by
Northwest's 314 planes in the first six months of the year, 12.6
billion miles were domestic and 7.3 billion were flown on routes to
the Pacific Rim, where Northwest has the largest presence of any
U.S. carrier. A revenue passenger mile represents one paying
passenger flown one mile.
   Checchi has vowed to keep the company's headquarters in Eagan, a
St. Paul suburb minutes from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport, and he has said the jobs of the carrier's 37,590 employees
are secure.

   Test wells have confirmed the discovery
of a major oil reservoir near the Prudhoe Bay field on Alaska's
North Slope, Arco Alaska Inc. said Friday.
   Arco Alaska, a division of Atlantic Richfield Co., said a test
well 2{ miles west of the 1988 discovery well at Point McIntyre
produced flow rates up to 5,400 barrels a day. Arco spokeswoman
Susan Andrews said that would make it one of the largest oil
discoveries in the United States in the last 10 years.
   Arco estimates the reservoir, two miles north of the Prudhoe Bay
field, contains 300 million barrels. Prudhoe Bay, the nation's
largest oilfield, contained an estimated 10 billion barrels.
   ``With testing completed on these two delineation wells, we have
confirmed the presence of a high-quality reservoir with good
porosity and permeability,'' said Jerry Dees, vice president of
exploration for Arco.
   Exxon Corp. and BP Exploration, a unit of British Petroleum Co.
PLC, are Arco's partners in the Point McIntyre field.

   There's no telling how many people will be
indicted as a result of the ongoing federal probe into fraudulent
trading at the world's largest futures exchanges, but it could be
as many as 200, a defense lawyer said Friday.
   Attorney George Collins, asked about a published report saying
the next few months could bring an additional 100 indictments, said
the government could seek many more than that _ or less.
   ``It could be as many as they want,'' said Collins, who
represents an indicted trader.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas' office did not immediately return
telephone calls, but his office has consistently declined comment
about the breadth of the investigation into trading at the Chicago
Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``They could potentially indict anybody who ever put a (trading)
jacket on'' said defense attorney Thomas Durkin, referring to minor
violations. ``I think it will go on for a couple of years.''
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported in Friday's editions that more
than 100 additional indictments are expected this fall, with
charges ranging from minor infractions to major violations like
those already charged.
   Meanwhile, 25 of the 46 traders indicted Wednesday were expected
to cooperate with federal authorities in meetings next week, the
Wall Street Journal reported in Friday's editions.
   A handful of traders had been cooperating for months, and 14
have agreed to plead guilty and help investigators, federal sources
have said.
   Collins said whether people decided to cooperate likely would be
a matter of personal character, the strength of evidence against
them, and whether they had information that was valuable to
authorities.
   ``It's a matter of selling something valuable,'' Collins said.
   ``You've got to sell something to get something,'' he said.
``Some people as a matter of principle wouldn't even tell the truth
to the government. Others would lie on their mothers to get out of
it.''
   Collins said his client, Bradley Ashman, would not cooperate.
Ashman was indicted on one count of conspiracy under the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, 13 counts of
violating the Commodities Exchange Act and one count of making
false statements to a government agent.
   The indictments capped a 2{-year undercover investigation in
which at least four FBI agents posed as traders at the two
exchanges.
   Pleas were scheduled Wednesday from 21 of those indicted before
U.S. District Judge George M. Marovich, who was assigned cases
involving the Japanese yen pit.
   The 19 soybean-pit defendants were to be arraigned Aug. 25
before U.S. District Judge William T. Hart.
   Three more traders were indicted for alleged activities in the
bond pit, and three others were accused of wrongdoing in the Swiss
franc pit.
   In the indictments, traders were accused of systematically
conspiring to skim profits from customer accounts and attempting to
hide earnings from the Internal Revenue Service.
   Brokers trading for their own accounts as well as customers'
accounts, a practice called dual trading, were alleged to have
routinely and illegally cheated customers with the cooperation of
``locals,'' or traders who traded only for their own accounts.
   Eighteen of the defendants charged Wednesday are accused of
violations of the RICO act, which carry penalties of up to 20 years
in prison.
   RICO empowers the government to freeze defendants' assets before
trial and to seize them upon conviction if they are found to have
been acquired through illegal means. But the Sun-Times quoted
government sources as saying prosecutors would not try to seize
defendants' homes.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices took their biggest dive in about 22
months Friday as a stronger-than-expected employment report jolted
a market already bracing for a heavy supply of new Treasury issues
to be auctioned next week.
   The yield of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose above 8
percent, just a week after it finished the session below that level
for the first time in more than two years.
   The bond's price fell 2[ points, or more than $21 per $1,000
face amount, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction
from its price, leaped to 8.07 percent from 7.90 percent late
Thursday.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, dropped 12.67 to 1,188.13.
   That was the biggest one-day decline in that index since it fell
13.08 on Oct. 14, 1987 _ five days before the stock market crash.
   The trigger for the big price decline was the Labor Department's
report on Friday morning that businesses added 169,000 jobs in July
as the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent. In addition, the
government revised upward its original estimate of job growth in
June to 250,000 from 180,000.
   Elliott Platt, research director for Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities, said the job creation numbers indicated the economy has
more resilience than some economists have expected.
   ``It really brought the sellers out,'' he said.
   In recent days, Platt said, the perception had been growing that
the economy was slowing markedly and that the Federal Reserve may
have to loosen its credit policy to avoid a recession.
   But with the economy still expanding, he said, bond traders are
now betting that the central bank will leave its policy unchanged
for awhile.
   Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities
International, said he doesn't ``buy the argument that the
employment report was that strong.''
   He said the market is more concerned about absorbing the $29.5
billion in new securities that the Treasury plans to auction next
week.
   In addition, he said, the market is wary about the new supply of
issues that may be headed its way as a result of a compromise
between the White House and Congress on a rescue package for the
nation's savings and loans.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell | point to a full point, intermediate maturities
lost 1[ point to 1{ points, and long-term issues fell as much as 2[
points, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   In corporate trading, industrials fell. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, lost
4.20 to 331.10.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds dropped 7-16 point. The average yield to
maturity rose to 7.20 percent from 7.16 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.11 percent as the
discount jumped 22 basis points to 7.85 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 8.11 percent as the discount rose 27 basis
points to 7.70 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.05
percent as the discount rose 33 basis points to 7.50 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8~ percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

   Gold and silver futures prices fell sharply Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as the dollar surged in value against other
major currencies in reaction to the government's report on July
unemployment.
   On other markets, the major agricultural commodities were higher
while energy futures prices were mostly lower.
   Gold futures settled $5.40 to $6 lower with August at $367.80 a
troy ounce; silver was 12.2 cents to 13.3 cents lower with
September at $5.20 a troy ounce.
   The Labor Department's report of a 5.2 percent jobless rate in
July fell within the market's expectations and was considered
neutral for the financial markets, analysts said.
   But the agency's revision of the June non-farm payroll number,
showing a gain of 250,000 jobs instead of 180,000, indicated the
economy was healthier than had previously been believed.
   ``That revision obviously pointed toward the fact that while the
economy has slowed down significantly, it certainly is not pointing
toward an imminent recession,'' said Peter Cardillo, an analyst
with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``Either way, it means economic conditions do not favor
metals,'' he said. ``They'll have to look to the dollar for
direction.''
   The dollar skyrocketed and interest rates jumped in response to
the report, prompting a shift of investment dollars from the
precious metals to interest-bearing instruments.
   Soybean futures prices posted strong gains on the Chicago Board
of Trade, rebounding from a weeklong string of losses as traders
evened up their positions ahead of the weekend.
   Grain futures also advanced, partly in tandem with soybeans and
partly in reaction to a private crop-production estimate pegging
the 1989 corn and soybean harvests slightly below Agriculture
Department projections.
   Soybeans for delivery in August had fallen a total of more than
85 cents a bushel in the five previous sessions as growing
conditions improved and supplies of newly harvested South American
soybeans increased.
   ``This rally was long overdue,'' said Walter Spilka,
grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New
York. ``The market was oversold technically and it was just a
matter of which day it would fall on.''
   Wheat settled } cent lower to } cent higher with September at
$3.87{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with
September at $2.19{ a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4} cents higher
with September at $1.40\ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 16{
cents higher with August at $5.90} a bushel.
   Most live cattle futures climbed on buying spurred by strong
cash markets. Higher cash hog prices supported the pork complex.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .62 cent higher with August at
74.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher
with August at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent to .90
cent higher with August at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .65 cent to 1.28 cents higher with August at 26.27 cents a
pound.
   Crude oil futures sank on the New York Mercantile Exchange but
the near-month contract failed to pierce $18 a barrel.
   Traders said volume was extremely light in an uneventful session.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 21 cents
lower with September at $18.03 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent
lower to .06 cent higher with September at 49.18 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .43 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
September at 51.24 cents a gallon.

   Walt Disney Co.'s stock price fell nearly $5
per share Friday after rising $11.25 the previous two days as
speculation that it was a takeover target died down.
   Disney shares dropped $4.87{ a share to close at $116.12{ in
active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Harold Vogel, entertainment analyst with Merrill Lynch Research
in New York, attributed the decline to reports dismissing a
takeover of Disney as unlikely, including a column by Dan Dorfman
in USA Today.
   ``A lot of people realize there's nothing imminent happening,''
Vogel said.
   The run-up this week was the latest in a series of recent surges
of Disney share prices, fueled by far more than takeover rumors.
   Disney recently reported its second-quarter profit rose 24
percent, its summer movies have turned in better-than-expected
performances and attendance has been so strong at its new studios
theme park that Disney plans to double the size of the Orlando,
Fla., attraction.
   Disney disclosed this week that it plans a new sea-oriented
theme park next to the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose attractions in
Long Beach.

<HEAD>Whitney Cuts Offer for Prime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the wake of three consecutive quarterly losses,
Prime Computer Inc. on Friday reluctantly recommended that its
shareholders accept a buyout by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. for about $1.1
billion, $74 million less than Whitney's previous offer.
   Prime's board of directors said the merger was still preferable
to selling its minicomputer business to MAI Basic Four Inc. of
Tustin, Calif., which has offered $525 million for the division.
   Whitney, a New York venture capital firm, said it would pay $20
a share for Prime's outstanding common stock, down from its
previous offer of $21.50 a share or about $1.2 billion.
   The reduction in Whitney's offer was not as drastic as Wall
Street had anticipated, and Prime's stock rose $1.12{ cents a share
to close at $17.75 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   An arbitrageur, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Whitney's original offer had been widely viewed as untenable, and
the new offer was more realistic, raising traders' confidence that
the deal would go through.
   ``The board of directors of Prime is very disappointed that J.H.
Whitney and its financial sources have not completed the $21.50 per
share offer ...,'' said David J. Dunn, Prime's chairman.
   ``However, after review of all the alternatives, the board of
directors believes that the revised J.H. Whitney offer is the best
economic alternative available for Prime stockholders,'' Dunn said
in a statement.
   Prime, which makes minicomputers and computer-aided design and
manufacturing systems, turned a profit of $19 million on sales of
$1.6 billion in 1988. But the cost of defending against a takeover
and slow sales of minicomputers led to losses of $14.4 million in
the final quarter of 1988, $5 million in the first quarter of this
year and $19 million in the second quarter.
   Whitney emerged last month as a ``white knight,'' or friendly
buyer, to save Prime from a hostile, $970 million bid by MAI Basic
Four and its chairman, New York takeover specialist Bennett S.
LeBow.
   After Prime reported the most recent, $19 million loss last
week, Whitney came under pressure from its main financing sources _
Bank of Boston and Chemical Bank _ to line up an additional $50
million of financing to ensure that it could ride out a period of
continued losses.
   Whitney said Thursday it had been unable to obtain the
additional financing at $21.50 per share and was entering
negotiations with Prime to reduce the offer.
   The revised offer of $20 a share applies to Prime's 49.5 million
outstanding common shares, which represent about 79 percent of the
company's stock on a fully-diluted basis.
   Whitney has offered to exchange notes with a face value of $22
per share for the remaining 21 percent of Prime's shares.
Securities analysts said those notes would trade at a substantial
discount and estimated the total value of the deal at $17 to $18.50
a share, or $1.06 billion to $1.16 billion.
   Prime postponed its annual meeting from Aug. 9 to Aug. 24 to
give stockholders time to consider the revised offer.

   Civilian unemployment dipped a tick to 5.2
percent in July, the government said Friday. Analysts say the data
should ease fears of an imminent recession but heighten concerns
about inflation.
   Joblessness was down from 5.3 percent in June, with nonfarm
businesses adding 169,000 jobs, the Labor Department said.
   At the same time, June's job growth was revised from 180,000 to
250,000, additional evidence that the economy continues to grow,
though at a slower pace than last year.
   ``This suggests an economy that is clearly, clearly far from a
recession,'' said Elliot Platt, senior vice president of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ``Despite a lot of signs of economic weakness
the labor market remains fairly strong.''
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, said the report was ``good news'' and ``suggests the
economy is continuing to expand.''
   While the job growth number provided encouraging news, analysts
were wary over data showing significant upward pressure on wages _
a welcome development for workers but a sign of stubborn inflation
as well.
   The Labor Department said average hourly earnings rose 0.8
percent in July after increasing just 0.1 percent in the prior two
months.
   ``That's a very, very powerful increase,'' said Platt.
   ``Ominous,'' was the way Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. chief
economist Allen Sinai described the wage gains.
   Both agreed that July's wage increase should give pause to the
Federal Reserve Board, which of late has relaxed monetary policy in
hopes of fueling enough new growth to avert a recession.
   ``There will be no more easing by the Fed until after Labor
Day.'' said Sinai.
   The government said the unemployment rate fell last month even
though civilian employment declined by 82,000 people to 117.45
million. The rate fell because of a larger decline, of 146,000
people, in the labor force _ the number of people who have jobs or
are seeking employment.
   The job growth again came predominantly in the service economy,
which accounted for 140,000 of the 169,000 new positions.
   Within services, government employment was down by 25,000 jobs
but retail trade added 52,000, wholesale trade 5,000,
transportation and public utilities 23,000 and finance, insurance
and real estate 11,000. Both business and health services posted
modest gains, the government said.
   The goods-producing sector added 29,000 jobs, with gains in
construction and manufacturing offset somewhat by declines in
mining and the automobile industry.
   The 35,000 boost in construction jobs came at the same time that
housing starts and home sales were rebounding. Manufacturing posted
a modest gain of 3,000 positions after three consecutive monthly
declines.
   Employment in the auto industry fell by 12,000 jobs last monh
after a decline of 16,000 in June, a slump coinciding with sluggish
car sales.
   Employment in mining was down 11,000, a figure heavily
influenced by coal strikes in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky
that have sparked wildcat actions in other coal-producing states.
   The government said the average workweek for production and
nonsupervisory employees in private industry increased by 0.3
hours, to 34.9 hours. The factory work week held steady at 41 hours
and overtime in July averaged 3.9 hours a week, up from 3.8 hours
in June, the Labor Department said.
   The jump in earnings brought average hourly pay in the private
sector to $9.70 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from $9.62 in
June.
   The payroll and wage data are taken from the Labor Department's
monthly survey of businesses. A separate household survey found few
major shifts in unemployment among demographic groups, although
joblessness among black teen-agers fell to 27.4 percent last month
from 36.5 percent in June. The June total had been up from 32.4
percent in May.
   These were the July and June rates for other population groups:
   _Adult white men, 3.8 percent, up from 3.7.
   _Adult white women, 4.3 percent, up from 4.1.
   _White teen-agers, 13.4 percent, up from 12.6.
   _Adult black men, 9.3 percent, down from 9.4.
   _Adult black women, 9.9 percent, down from 10.5.
   _Hispanics, 9 percent, up fro 8.1.
   A separate calculation of unemployment that includes members of
the armed services stationed in the United States was unchanged at
5.2 percent.

<HEAD>Phillips Seeking Replacement For Hyundai in Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. said Friday it
is seeking a new partner for a $100 million joint venture to
explore for oil and natural gas in the United States after Hyundai
Corp. withdrew.
   Phillips, Hyundai and the Overseas Petroleum and Investment
Corp. signed a joint venture agreement April 3 to launch a
three-year, 100-prospect drilling venture.
   Following the signing, the South Korean government was to review
the agreement for approval of Hyundai's investment in the project,
but the government did not give its approval to the Korean company.
   The South Korean government wanted assurances that all 100
prospects would be drilled in the three-year period and Phillips
was not prepared to make that guarantee because of variables
affecting oil exploration, said Jere Smith, a spokesman at Phillips
headquarters here.
   Smith said Hyundai sought a subsidy from the South Korean
government to underwrite its participation in the project.
   Phillips was to bear 10 percent of the cost of the venture while
45 percent each was to be provided by Hyundai and OPIC, an
affiliated company of Chinese Petroleum Corp. of Taiwan. The
Taiwanese government has given its approval to OPIC's participation.
   Smith said Phillips is, at least for now, accepting the cost of
Hyundai's part of the venture, which already has begun with 11
wells drilled or being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico, California,
Texas and elsewhere.
   ``We have made provisions in case something like this
happened,'' Smith said.
   He said Phillips is seeking a replacement for Hyundai in the
venture, but he would not say whether a new partner might be a
domestic or foreign company.
   ``We've had several prospects express interest. We're
optimistic,'' Smith said.

<HEAD>TWA Suspends Contract Talks; Mentions Possible Merger or Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. has suspended
contract talks with its largest union because of the possibility of
a merger or change in management at the airline, a union spokesman
said Friday.
   The company, owned by takeover specialist Carl Icahn, confirmed
that the talks had been halted, but refused to say why.
   Icahn had previously expressed interest in buying strikebound
Eastern Airlines and had been in extensive talks with that
carrier's unions.
   His interest recently has shifted to other possible
combinations, according to a Machinists union official.
   ``Carl's been shopping that airline (TWA) now for the past
couple months,'' said John Peterpaul, vice president of the
International Association of Machinists. ``If he's got a buyer,
we're not going to impede that ... unless it's a bad deal,'' he
said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   A TWA memo sent to management employees late Friday said it
would be premature to speculate about a merger.
   ``As you are aware, the subject of combination or merger of TWA
has been discussed from time to time over the last several years
and continues to be one of several possible strategies for TWA,''
Jerry Nichols, executive vice president and chief operating
officer, wrote in the memo.
   ``For us to speculate on any such possibilities at this time
would be premature,'' Nichols said.
   Contract negotiations broke off Thursday, according to David
Schulte, secretary-treasurer of Local 949 of the Machinists union
District 142.
   Schulte said he received a bulletin from the union's district
office in Kansas City, Mo., about the halt in negotiations.
   The bulletin said TWA had informed the union's negotiating
committee of the ``possibility of a corporate change in TWA as a
result of a combination or merger of the airline.''
   The Machinists union represents mechanics, reservation clerks,
janitors and other on-ground personnel. Its contract with the
airline expired Dec. 31 and employees have been working under a
temporary contract.
   Schulte said the union has been negotiating since last fall.
   ``We don't know whether he's (Icahn) looking to buy or looking
to sell, we don't know,'' said Schulte.
   Both sides agreed to meet within 10 days to discuss and review
the situation.

<HEAD>Announce $9.5 Million in Payments to Apple Growers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department on Friday announced
details of $9.5 million in payments to apple growers under a
program to combat surpluses arising from concern over use of the
chemical Alar.
   Under the plan, 57.5 million pounds of fresh apples will be
diverted by 56 growers in six states to an array of organizations
requesting them, including manufacturers of ethanol and livestock
feed, the department said.
   The plan is designed to divert the apples from normal trade
channels and thus, without disrupting the market, reduce a huge
surplus that piled up during the first half of the year after an
environmental group charged that Alar posed an unacceptably high
risk of cancer.
   Governmental officials say that apples are safe to eat and the
Environmental Protection Agency is taking steps to ban the use of
Alar, which is sprayed on fruit to enhance red color, extend
storage life and make harvetsing easier.
   The payments were awarded to bidders under a $15 million overall
program to aid the industry that was announced July 25 by the
department. it said growers participating are located in
Connecticut, New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington.
   Apples in the program will not be distributed through school
lunch programs, the department said.
   It said producers will receive payments of $4.97 to $8.20 for
40-pound cartons of apples and from $9.45 to $16.50 per
hundredweight for apples in bulk bins.

   A federal judge on Friday ordered Fairchild
Publications to change the name of its Automotive Electronic News,
but denied a $1 million damage claim by publishers of a similarly
named trade journal.
   U.S. District Judge George LaPlata ruled that the new magazine's
name infringes on Crain Communications' trademark for its
long-established weekly Automotive News.
   He gave Fairchild until Oct. 1 to remove either ``automotive''
or ``news'' from the title.
   Both media companies appeared satisfied with the ruling, which
followed a three-week trial.
   ``We consider it to be a complete victory,'' said Raymond E.
Scott, an attorney for Chicago-based Crain. ``One would like to

<HEAD>Pan Am Reports $7.7 Million Second-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. on Friday reported it lost more
money in the second quarter than it did in the same period last
year.
   Pan Am reported a net loss of $7.7 million for the quarter,
compared with a loss of $5 million in the same quarter last year.
   The nation's eighth-largest airline company said revenue of its
main subsidiary, Pan American World Airways, continued to suffer
from lower international traffic in the wake of the Pan Am crash
over Scotland last December.
   The latest loss occurred despite ``aggressive pricing actions''
and some benefit from the strike affecting rival Eastern Airlines,
Pan Am said.
   The results for the latest quarter include a gain of $92.1
million on the sale of the company's Pan Am World Services unit and
expenses of $28.2 million stemming from its unsuccessful takeover
bid for NWA Inc., the parent of rival Northwest Airlines.
   Total revenue for the second quarter declined 1.7 percent to
$909.4 million from $925.4 million a year earlier.
   Combined revenue from the Pan Am Shuttle and Pan Am Express, a
commuter airline subsidiary, jumped 47.8 percent to $83.2 million
from $56.3 million, partly offsetting the decline at Pan American
World Airways.
   ``We are determined to stay on course with our efforts to
restore Pan Am's competitive position despite these unfortunate
setbacks,'' said Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett. ``While our bid (for
NWA) was unsuccessful, we believe Northwest presented the type of
opportunity we will pursue aggressively in order to secure Pan Am's
long-term future.''
   Separately Friday, Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi signed
the acquisition papers to complete his group's $3.65 billion buyout
of NWA.
   For the first half of the year, Pan Am's net loss widened to
$158.8 million from $88.4 million in the same period of 1988.
   First-half revenue slipped 2.7 percent to $1.64 billion from
$1.69 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>SEC Accuses Two Investors Of Trying To Cheat 100 Brokerages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Thursday accused two investors of a scheme to defraud more than 100
brokerages, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In a civil lawsuit, the SEC says the investors, Jury Matt Hansen
and Fergus M. Sloan Jr., and their New York brokerage firm, Fermat
Associates, committed fraud by buying millions of dolars worth of
securities without having sufficient money to pay for them and
selling them later the same day at a profit to cover their cost,
The New York Times reported in Friday's editions.
   The illegal practice is known as ``free riding.''
   The SEC also charges the Toronto Dominion Bank violated federal
banking regulations by providing the investors with credit although
the two did not produce collateral. The bank was not charged with
fraud.
   The SEC said the investors, through a partnership registered in
Panama, Graycliff International SA, opened an account at the New
York branch of Toronto Dominion. The agency said the bank often
covered the investors' checks overnight when the funds in the
account were insufficient.
   The investors then opened 250 accounts at more than 100
brokerages, using 76 names, the suit charges. Since December 1984,
the SEC claims, the defendants used this ``web of accounts'' to buy
and sell securities on the same day.
   The agency says the men earned more than $1 million through the
scheme but left debts of $1.5 million at four brokerage houses at
which they had steep losses: Steinberg &amp; Lyman, Universal
Securities of America Inc., Merrill Lynch and Dominick &amp; Dominick.
   The SEC said it found no losses at any other brokerages.
   Calls to the investors' office were answered by someone who
identified himself as a temporary employee and said he had know
knowledge of the SEC suit, the Times reported. A message left on
Sloan's answering machine was not returned, the newspaper said.
Hansen's home phone number is unlisted.
   Elliot Schnapp, a laywer representing the men, said he belived
the charges were without merit.
   ``It appears to us that the SEC is seeking to retroactively
declare illegal a type of trading many investors and banks have
engaged in for many years and not thought to be illegal,'' he told
the Times.
   He also denied that the men left debts at the four brokerages.
   In response to an SEC request, a U.S. District Court judge in
Manhattan on Thursday issued a temporary restraining order to stop
the two men from continuing their investment activities. The court
also froze their assets.
   In addition, the court issued a temporary order to restrain the
Toronto bank from ``further violations of the credit extension
provisions.''
   In a statement, the bank said it had been cooperating with the
SEC for several months and was ``an innocent bystander in the areas
under investigation.''
