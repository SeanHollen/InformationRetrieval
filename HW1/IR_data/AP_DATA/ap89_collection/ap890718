<HEAD>Some Experimental Instruments Left on Moon Are Still Working</HEAD>

   A laser reflection experiment that scientists
compared to using a rifle to hit a moving dime two miles away is the
only instrument on the moon from the Apollo program still working,
NASA officials said Tuesday.
   The device, called a laser ranging retro-reflector, is used
regularly to reflect laser beamss aimed at it from Earth, said
officials at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   One was set in the lunar dust in the Sea of Tranquility 20 years
ago by astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin
Jr., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.
   ``One of the reasons why it's still being used is because there's
no energy required on the moon for it to be used,'' said Jean
Dickey, supervisor of the Space Geodetic Science and Applications
Group at the laboratory.
   Similar reflectors were left elsewhere on the moon by Apollo 14
and Apollo 15, and by Lunakhod 2, an unmanned Soviet lander, and all
four still are used by three ground stations on Earth, Dickey said.
   ``It's the only experiment from the Apollo program that is still
working,'' she said.
   A solar-powered instrument package also was left on the moon to
transmit data back to Earth by Apollo 11, and each of the five
successful lunar landings placed nuclear-powered instrument stations
on the moon.
   But all were shut down during the mid-1970s, as budget cuts made
it impossible to continue processing data transmitted from the moon,
said Charles Redmond, a NASA spokesman in Washington.
   The laser ranging retro-reflector is the moving dime in
scientists' rifle-shooting analogy, and was designed to reflect
laser pulses fired from the McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis,
Texas. The idea was to measure the round-trip travel time of a pulse
of light from the Earth to the moon and back.
   The information can be used to calculate distances with
unprecedented accuracy, not only from the Earth to the moon, but
between particular observatories on Earth, Dickey said.
   ``When you think that we can measure the distance from the Earth
to the moon to within three centimeters, about an inch, it's really
pretty incredible,'' Dickey said.
   Among other things, experiments have shown that the moon is
gradually pulling away from the Earth, at about 1{ inches a year.
   Scientists using the lunar reflectors also have measured how the
Earth's continental plates are slowly drifting. They found that the
atmosphere, tides and Earth's core cause variations in the length of
a day, varying by about one-thousandth of a second over a year.
   ``There's been a tremendous growth in our accuracy,'' Dickey
said. Twenty years ago, ``the original ranges were with an accuracy
of meters.''
   Improvements in accuracy were made possible primarily by the
placement of additional reflectors on the moon, and of two
additional observatories, in Hawaii and France, Dickey said.
   The reflectors are too small to be seen from Earth, so even when
the laser is correctly aligned on Earth it is a challenge to
actually hit the lunar target, laboratory officials said.
   The amount of light reflected back to Earth is very small, Dickey
said, and usually is measured in photons, the fundamental unit of
light.

<HEAD>Kirov Dances `Bayadere' and `Potemkin'</HEAD>

   The Kirov Ballet combined the beautiful ``La
Bayadere'' third act with a paean to its revolution, ``Battleship
Potemkin,'' at the Metropolitan Opera on Tuesday night.
   Altynai Asylmuratova, 28, the ballerina most admired during the
current Kirov Ballet engagement, danced the leading role opposite
Konstantin Zaklinsky, who is her husband, in ``La Bayadere.''
   There is a story to this Marius Petipa ballet, but seeing the
third act alone, one doesn't need to know it and dancers don't need
to act characters. The corps de ballet enters, one at a time, and
this corps de ballet is unsurpassed for timing and sweetness. Miss
Asylmuratova didn't surpass memories of Dame Margot Fonteyn dancing
the same thing, but she, too, made this section of ``La Bayadere''
magical.
   Three ballerinas, Irina Chistyakova, Yelena Pankova and Zhanna
Ayupova, who danced variations, all were wonderful.
   ``Battleship Potemkin'' was choreographed some four years ago by
the company's artistic director, Oleg Vinogradov, to a score
composed for it by Aleksandr Tchaikovsky. Americans would consider
``Potemkin'' a novelty but it's obvious from its hour-plus length
and many elaborate backdrops that it's intended to be more than
that. Americans probably also wouldn't want to see ``Potemkin'' more
than once. Some of it is decidedly odd.
   The choreographic technique is to use modern dance, not following
the rules of ballet but making the turns and steps extremely
balletic, especially for solos by Vladimir Bondarenko and Andrei
Garbuz as sailors. Ship's officers kick a sailor to death, then
another. Death (Gennadi Babanin) has a long, athletic duet with each.
   The ship's commander (Yuri Gumba) hops with both feet together
and has other steps which portray him as a childish madman. The Tzar
and Tzarina come on board, moving stiffly like puppets. She dances
as though imitating the can can. The choreography makes the
oppressors look silly but it isn't very interesting as dance.
   Finally the sailors band together, face officers with guns who
run away, kick the commander, toss their shirts in the air, cavort
with joy and run down an aisle.
   The artistic image to hold from this program is ``La Bayadere.''

   All children in the United States, especially
those entering middle school or junior high school, should be given
a second vaccination against measles, the American Academy of
Pediatrics said.
   The shot would be in addition to one that all children are
supposed to receive when they are about 15 months old, according to
the academy headquartered in suburban Elk Grove Village.
   The warning issued by the academy Monday comes with doctors
fearing that measles infections in 1989 could be worse than in any
of the past nine years.
   Many children are contracting the disease even though they were
vaccinated as infants, Dr. Scott Giebink of the University of
Minnesota said Monday. Giebink is a member of the academy's
committee on infectious diseases.
   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has counted 7,563
measles cases throughout the nation this year up to July 9, a 376
percent increase over the 1,586 cases reported during the comparable
period last year.
   John Mullen of the CDC said there are 30 outbreaks, or clusters,
of measles cases in 19 states.
   The majority of new cases are in children and young people from
kindergarten through college, Giebink said.
   ``About 60 percent were in children already vaccinated,'' he said.
   As a result, ``the academy and the U.S. Public Health Service
both now recommend two doses of the vaccine for all children in the
United States,'' he said.

   ``Batman'' has passed such stellar hits as ``The
Exorcist,'' ``Gremlins'' and the original ``Superman'' to become the
highest-grossing film in Warner Bros. history.
   Although it finished second on the weekend box-office charts,
with receipts of $15.1 million, ``Batman'' has collected $167.6
million to date, and will almost certainly become this summer's
biggest hit, surpassing ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   Meanwhile, ``Lethal Weapon 2'' claimed the No. 1 spot for the
second consecutive week, leaving the new James Bond film ``Licence
to Kill'' reeling in its wake.
   ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as Los
Angeles policemen out to smash a South African money laundering
scheme, grossed $17.2 million nationwide to lead all other titles,
according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   In third place over the weekend was the Disney comedy ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids,'' which continues to attract waves of moviegoers.
``Honey,'' starring Rick Moranis, sold $8.806 million worth of
tickets, topping the opening of ``Licence to Kill.''
   The latest Bond film, starring Timothy Dalton, debuted weakly,
grossing $8.775 million to finish in fourth place. The last Bond
film, ``The Living Daylights,'' netted more than $11 million in its
opening weekend in 1987.
   In fifth was Disney's re-release of the animated ``Peter Pan,''
with sales of $5.6 million. It was followed in sixth by Steven
Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' with a gate of
$4.6 million.
   The comedy sequel ``Ghostbusters II,'' starring Bill Murray and
Dan Aykroyd, was seventh on proceeds of $4.33 million. In eighth was
Robin Williams in ``Dead Poets Society,'' which grossed $4.26
million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' with $3.7
million, place, and ``Do the Right Thing,'' with $3 million. The new
romantic comedy ``When Harry Met Sally...'' had a strong opening in
a limited release, selling $1.1 million worth of tickets in only 41
theaters.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' Warner Bros., $17.2 million, 1,830
screens, $9,392 per screen, $49.2 million, two weeks.
   2. ``Batman,'' Warner Bros., $15.1 million, 2,201 screens, $6,867
per screen, $167.6 million, four weeks.
   3. ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' Disney, $8.806 million, 1,460
screens, $6,031 per screen, $74.8 million, four weeks.
   4. ``Licence to Kill,'' MGM-UA, $8.775 million, 1,575 screens,
$5,571 per screen, $8.775 million, one week.
   5. ``Peter Pan,'' Disney, $5.6 million, 1,475 screens, $3,805 per

   Here are highlights of events on the
Apollo 11 moon flight 20 years ago today:
   As Apollo 11 coasted smoothly toward the moon, astronauts Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left Mike Collins alone in the command
module Columbia and crawled through a connecting tunnel to enter the
lunar module Eagle. With earthlings watching on television,
Armstrong and Aldrin inspected the craft and checked switch settings
to make certain nothing had been disturbed or damaged by buffeting
at the time of launch. They reported the lunar ship was in good
shape.
   At 11:32 p.m. EDT, the astronauts passed through an area called
the equigravisphere, a ``twilight zone'' in which the gravitational
influence of the Earth and moon is about equal. Once through this
zone, the moon won the gravitational tug-of-war and Apollo 11 was in
the grip of lunar gravity. The ship passed through this invisible
barrier when it was 43,495 miles from the moon and 214,402 miles
from Earth.

   A new genetic discovery may help the search for
treatments for retinitis pigmentosa, a disease of blindness that
afflicts some 100,000 Americans, researchers say.
   Scientists reported Monday they had located a gene that causes
one form of the inherited disease, a step toward isolating and
analyzing the gene.
   That analysis in turn could give leads for finding genes that
cause other forms of the disease, said researcher Peter Humphries.
And finding out what the genes do may give researchers ideas for
treatment, he said.
   Retinitis pigmentosa, called RP, progresses from night blindness
to tunnel vision to blindness. Symptoms are caused by degeneration
in the retina, a delicate layer of cells at the back of the eye that
detect images and relay them to the brain.
   RP comes in several forms. About 20 percent of cases are caused
by the ``autosomal dominant'' form, in which each child has a 50
percent chance of inheriting the disease from an affected parent.
   The gene in the new study may cause about half the autosomal
dominant cases of RP, said study co-author Stephen Daiger, professor
of medical genetics at the University of Texas Health Science Center
in Houston.
   Other scientists located the gene for another form of RP several
years ago, but they have not yet been able to isolate it, Daiger
said.
   He and Humphries, who is lecturer in medical genetics at Trinity
College in Dublin, Ireland, discussed the discovery at a news
conference sponsored by the Baltimore-based RP Foundation Fighting
Blindness. The organization supported the research.
   The work is ``the first big step'' to isolating and analyzing the
gene, said Gerald Chader, director of intramural research at the
National Eye Institute, in a telephone interview.
   Genes lie on tiny thread-like structures called chromosomes. Some
genes cause disease when they fail to work correctly.
   To locate particular genes, scientists begin with so-called
chemical ``markers'' on the genes. These markers, which can be
easily recognized in the laboratory, can be used to trace patterns
of inheritance. When researchers find families with markers close to
a gene of interest, they can move toward isolation of the gene
itself.
   The new work revealed a marker that appears to lie ``very, very
close indeed'' to the RP gene on the chromosome scientists designate
number 3, Humphries said.
   Humphries and colleagues studied a family near Dublin that has
100 living members, of whom half have RP. The work involved
comparing genetic material from affected and unaffected family
members.
   It may take several years to isolate the gene, Daiger said.
   Daiger said tentative data from his lab suggest that the gene
found in the Irish family is not responsible for the disease in an
American family he is studying.
   That is not surprising, since the two families have different
kinds of autosomal dominant RP, he said. The Irish family shows an
early-onset form, in which night blindness can be apparent as early
as age 1, while the American family shows a late-onset form, in
which night blindness may not appear until age 20 or later.
   The work on the Irish family is to be published in the October
issue of the journal Genomics, the RP foundation said.

   An explosion that ripped through a
fireworks factory on the side of the Vesuvius volcano killed two
people, wounded three and produced panic in nearby towns, police
said.
   Monday's explosion was heard up to a half-mile away and the
inhabitants of nearby hamlets thought the volcano was erupting,
authorities said. Several firetrucks and a helicopter arrived from
nearby Naples and doused the flames.
   Police said they did not know the cause of the blast.
   The victims were workers at the factory, which produced
skyrockets.
   Vesuvius last erupted in 1944.

   The government insisted Monday that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega would not step down as Panama's de facto
leader, complicating talks with the opposition on resolving the
nation's political crisis.
   Earlier, government representatives had said they were willing to
listen to a proposal for Noriega's departure. The negotiations began
Sunday under sponsorship of the Organization of American States.
   The discussions mark the first time since the annulled May 7
elections that the opposition has met with representatives of
Noriega, pro-government parties and the executive branch.
   Despite disagreements the groups agreed on an agenda in the talks
mediated by OAS diplomats.
   A government representative said negotiations will resume when
the opposition delegates return from an OAS meeting Wednesday in
Washington.
   The items listed on the agenda by the opposition include the
removal of Noriega as chief of Panama's Defense Forces, defining
what is meant by transfer of power, the elections that international
observers said the opposition won by a 3-1 margin, and human rights
violations.
   Government and military representatives listed as their agenda
items an end to what they called U.S. agression and military threats
against Panama; withdrawal of additional U.S. troops sent to Panama;
the return of Panamanian funds being held by the United States;
strict compliance with the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties that provide
for Panama to gain full control over the canal at the end of 1999,
and no U.S. interference in Panama's political affairs.
   ``The main differences are over fundamental issues,'' said
Ricardo Arias Calderon during a break in the second day of talks.
Calderon was an opposition vice presidential candidate in the May
vote.
   Carlos Duque, the government party candidate, said during the
break: ``Noriega is not negotiable.''
   Before the session began, Duque said government representatives
would consider Noriega's departure but they also want two U.S.
generals to leave and U.S. sanctions to end.
   ``We will bring the evidence to defend Noriega's case,'' Duque
said. ``They can bring it up as we could bring up the departure of
Gen. (Marc) Cisneros and Gen. (Fred) Woerner, and an end to the U.S.
economic aggressions and the withdrawal of the additional U.S.
troops sent to Panama.''
   Woerner heads the Southern Command, which includes all U.S.
military installations in Panama. Cisneros is commander of Army
troops charged with the defense of the Canal.
   Cisneros often is criticized locally for his anti-Noriega
statements and the military maneuvers and exercises his forces
conduct.
   The opposition had refused to take part in talks unless
representatives of the military also took part; Noriega's position
was that the problem was one for politicians to solve and that he
would remain as head of the Defense Forces, come what may.
   The U.S. government also is opposed to Noriega, whom it has
indicted on drug-related charges and accused of domestic repression.
The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Panama to force
Noriega's ouster and has increased its military forces for
protection of the Panama Canal.
   The meeting was arranged by an OAS mission led by foreign
minister Diego Cordovez of Ecuador. Other members of the mission are
OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares of Brazil, Guatemalan
Foreign Minister Mario Palencia, and Sahadeo Basdeo, Foreign
Minister of Trinidad and Tobago.
   The group said it would leave for Washington on Tuesday to submit
a report to the organization the following day.
   While Monday's meeting was in progress, Noriega attended a
session of the State Council, which is studying a proposal for
forming a junta after Sept. 1 when the current government's term
ends.
   As he left the meeting, Noriega was asked about the country's
political situation. He said nothing but reached into the seat of
his car and, smiling, took out a police club and waved it at
journalists.

   Interim results from a study of an experimental
Alzheimer's disease drug called THA are promising enough to keep the
study going, the project's chief investigator says.
   Researchers analyzed results from the first 100 patients to
complete the project, said Kenneth Davis.
   The study could have been stopped if interim results demonstrated
that THA was either worthless or highly effective.
   Davis said that under the rules of the study, he could not
release details from the interim analysis. But he said it was
``encouraging enough to warrant continuation of the study.''
   Researchers hope 300 patients will eventually complete the study.
Final results may be available in a little more than a year, Davis
said Monday.
   Davis is professor and chairman of psychiatry at The Mount Sinai
Medical Center in New York, and principal investigator of the THA
study, which involves 16 institutions.
   The project, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, the
Alzheimer's Association and the Warner-Lambert Co., follows up on a
1986 study that suggested the drug may ease some symptoms in some
patients.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative illness that
impairs memory, thinking and behavior. An estimated 2.5 million
Americans are afflicted.
   THA, or tetrahydroaminoacridine, is also called tacrine.
   About 340 patients have entered an initial phase of the study so
far, but only 40 percent have proven eligible to continue into the
main portion of the project, Davis said.
   About 15 percent of the original group had to drop out because
they showed signs of potential liver damage from the drug, he said.
The balance of the drop-outs were removed because THA created no
significant improvement in their Alzheimer's symptoms in the initial
phase of the study, he said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost every day the sound of rocket
and artillery fire echoes through the capital, a reminder that the
Moslem guerrillas are close.
   ``It sounds like thunder. But when you look at the sky and there
are no clouds, you know what it is,'' said Iqbal Akhmed.
   ``And you know they're out there, just waiting,'' the 38-year-old
antiques dealer said, pointing at the mountains.
   The mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, are hiding in the
mountains about 10 miles away, just beyond the ridges that ring this
city of 2.25 million people.
   Since the final pullout of Soviet troops on Feb. 15, the
guerrillas have been saying a full-scale attack on Kabul is
imminent. But if they carry through with their threat, they will
face powerful air and land defenses capable of resisting a
substantial offensive.
   In a military emergency, the government can put 200,000 armed men
and women into battle against the guerrillas. This includes the
elite 16,000-man Presidential Guard and 20,000 armed civilians
fiercely loyal to the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan.
   ``I can assure that Kabul is well-defended,'' said the mayor,
Gen. Mohammad Hakim. ``This is no hollow claim.''
   Rebel commanders in the frontier city of Peshawar, Pakistan, say
they are mobilizing 20,000 fighters and readying them for action.
   U.S.-supplied weapons are loaded on colorfully painted trucks,
captured Soviet jeeps or donkeys and hauled from Pakistan, on narrow
dirt roads that crisscross the rebel-controlled countryside and over
mountains toward Kabul.
   ``Some pressure has got to be brought on the government,'' said
Mohammad Ishaq, a Peshawar-based spokesman for Hezb-e-Islami,
believed to be the strongest of the guerrilla groups around Kabul.
   But guerrilla leaders and field commanders appear divided about
their strategy, fearing a repeat of the March offensive on the
provincial capital of Jalalabad, about 75 miles east of Kabul.
   The country's fifth-largest city, Jalalabad was the guerrillas'
first major target after the Soviet troops left Afghanistan. The
insurgents had predicted the city would fall within three days, but
they have so far failed in their assault on President Najib's
well-equipped and dug-in forces.
   ``In Kabul, the mujahedeen want to go step-by-step and not face
the problems they faced in Jalalabad,'' said Mohammad Shoaib, a
Peshawar-based spokeman for the Jamiat-e-Islami rebel group.
   Foreign military experts in Kabul say any attack on the capital
would require a major effort in manpower and fire support as well as
a unified command structure and coordination by the already divided
guerrilla alliance.
   ``We do not think that the rebels have such capabilities, at
least they have not shown that they possess such capability in the
battle for Jalalabad,'' said an Asian defense expert, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The only option before the mujahedeen is to carry out
large-scale sabotage and create a fear psychosis and then during the
confusion, aim to launch a physical attack,'' he said.
   The Afghan army has divided Kabul into three sectors. The
northern district is defended by regular army units. The eastern
district is under the command of the Sarandoy, or state police.
   The western and southern districts, which have been linked as one
security zone, are under the Afghan secret police, known as KHAD.
   While the hills that surround Kabul provide cover for the
guerrillas, they also are a strategic advantage for the government.
Defense posts dotting the hills can detect advancing rebel groups
and pound them with artillery fire.
   The army also has 122mm rockets to bombard rebel-held points and
converted Soviet-made transport planes that can drop bombs from well
above the range of the rebels' American-made Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles.
   Although the Soviet troops are gone, the Kremlin still sends
dozens of giant military transport planes to Kabul every day with
weapons and ammunition.
   The rebels refuse to be tied to deadlines but say they won't wait
until next year to launch an attack.
   ``We're not willing to postpone it that long, but it is hard to
predict from day to day. It takes time,'' said Abdul Haidi
Arghandehwal, a spokesman for fundamentalist guerrilla leader
Gulbaddin Hekmatyar.
   Arghandehwal said the guerrillas plan to concentrate on the
perimeter defense posts and roads around Kabul and will try to
infiltrate into the city, mobilizing the people and generating mass
protests to undermine Najib's government.

   It's life in the fast lane for a road
crew given 24 days to complete a repaving project that usually would
take more than three months.
   About 75 workers hopped on bulldozers Monday along the seven-mile
stretch of Interstate 96 west of Grand Rapids after state Department
of Transportation officials fired a starting pistol and waved an
orange construction flag, DOT spokeswoman Janet Foren said.
   ``They really started moving when that gun went off,'' Foren said.
   Cold cash might have accounted for the hot start.
   The state will pay the chief contractor, Thompson-McCully Co. of
Belleville, $500 for each hour by which the company beats the 24-day
_ or 576-hour _ deadline. But if the company misses the deadline, it
will be fined $500 for each additional hour needed, Foren said.
   Road crews will work from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. six or seven days
a week to complete the $1.4 million project, Foren said. They
usually work from about 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. five days a week.
   Motorists can monitor the progress of the project by watching two
huge clocks at either end of the construction site that will count
down the 24 days.
   Foren said the clock will stop only when it rains.
   Unlike baseball, however, no full rain days will be allowed _
when the raindrops stop, the clock starts ticking.

   Bill Reasor doesn't shoulder 50-pound
blocks of ice anymore, but handling a pair of 20-pound bags is still
pretty good for a 91-year-old man.
   Reasor has operated an ice delivery business for 40 years, and he
has no intention of stopping.
   ``I'm never going to give this up until the day I die,'' he says.
``It gets me out of bed in the morning.''
   Reasor delivers for weddings, family reunions, restaurants and
club gatherings, bringing ice to people who identify him only by
what he does.
   ``People don't know my name,'' he said recently. ``They just call
me the ice man.''
   Demand always has been steady.
   He once delivered 2,000 pounds of ice a day. Now, he gives
heavier orders to his son, Kevin.
   But he still does his share.
   ``It's exercise,'' he said. ``Some fellows like to play baseball
or play tennis. It's a nice clean, cool job.''

<HEAD>President Calls For Peace Negotiations With Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Joaquim Chissano said Monday
his country is weary of war and said he authorized church leaders to
present government peace proposals to guerrillas.
   Chisano said the church officials and a government delegation
were in Nairobi for talks with guerrilla leaders on Wednesday. In
Portugal, a rebel spokesman said the guerrilla delegation would
consider the government proposals.
   It was not immediately clear what the government proposals would
include.
   An estimated 100,000 people have died in the 12-year-old civil
war that broke out after Mozambique gained independence from
Portugal. About 1.6 million Mozambicans are refugees, and half the
country's 14.7 million people depend, at least partially, on food
aid.
   Chissano, who in the past has rejected negotiations with the
Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas, said Monday he decided to
negotiate because of ``the sentiments of the population vis a vis
the war.''
   He said that although the Mozambican people repudiated the
guerrillas' ``acts of violence'' they also had ``a great desire for
the end of the war.''
   Chissano said he asked Catholic and Protestant members of the
19-church Mozambican Christian Council to meet with a guerrilla
delegation in Nairobi, Kenya to find out ``what they want,'' the
government news agency, AIM, reported.
   AIM quoted Chissano as saying the government will not inist that
the guerrillas lay down their arms, but that they ``end all acts of
terrorism and banditry.''
   Chissano said a Mozambican government delegation consisting of
provincial leaders was also in Nairobi to clarify the government's
position for the Kenyan government or the church delegation.
   RENAMO began its guerrilla war against the Marxist government in
1977, with Rhodesian help, and was then aided by South Africa from
1980-84, until South Africa signed a non-aggression pact with
Mozambique.
   The Mozambican government continued to accuse South Africa of
violating the agreement, but relations have improved recently and
the Mozambican government now says support for the guerrillas still
comes from South Africa, but it does not say who is behind it.
   RENAMO, which has been accused of mutilating peasants, enslaving
children, burning villages and crops and attacking food relief
convoys, is not openly supported by any government, but it maintains
offices in the United States and Portugal.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Henry Bellmon unveiled a plan Monday to
do away with property taxes and substitute a system of income tax
surcharges and new levies on most goods and services.
   The governor said the plan, designed to increase financing for
public schools, could generate $245 million in new revenue beginning
in 1991, amounting to about 8 percent of the state budget.
   ``Teachers would get most of this new money,'' Bellmon said,
noting it could mean average raises of up to $6,000 per teacher.
   The Republican governor met privately with legislative leaders to
discuss the plan, which Bellmon said he wants the Legislature to
pass in a special session he has called to begin Aug. 14.
   Teachers' union officials praised the plan, but some legislators
expressed reservations about the possibility of passing the
``Funding Equity and Equal Educational Opportunity Act'' in the
special session.
   Bellmon said the plan addresses public school funding and teacher
pay, areas in which Oklahoma has lagged far behind the national
average.
   ``We believe that once the plan is understood, there will be
widespread support,'' Bellmon said. ``Once the plan is fully
implemented, Oklahoma will be among the leaders in educational
excellence.''
   The state ranks 48th nationally in teacher salaries, with an
average of approximately $$22,000 a year, according to the Oklahoma
Education Association.
   The tax program overhauls the method of financing schools and
county government by replacing the local property tax with a 15
percent income tax surcharge and a new 2 percent ``school tax'' on
goods and services.
   The 2 percent ``school tax'' would be levied on value received
from the sale or lease of finished goods and services. It would be
in addition to the current 4 percent state sales tax.
   Groceries, on which the sales tax is now levied, and prescription
drugs would be exempted. The sales tax exemption would be removed
from the value of professional services such as those provided by
doctors, dentists, attorneys, accountants, plumbers, barbers,
beauticians and mechanics.
   The income tax surcharge would be assessed as a percentage of
personal and corporate income taxes paid. That money would be used
to fund county government that now depends on property taxes.
   The plan abolishes property taxes on homes, farms and other
personal property. A property tax would remain for commercial
property valued at more than $100,000 and on utility company
property.
   Local property taxes now produce more than $800 million for
schools and county government.
   Bellmon said his proposal is designed to solve ``a whole series
of problems related to education.''
   Kyle Dahlem, president of the Oklahoma Education Association, was
smiling broadly after Bellmon unveiled the plan.
   ``I am optimistic,'' Ms. Dahlem said. ``I must be optimistic. We
cannot afford to go another year or two or three without a
long-range plan.''
   Some legislators expressed caution.
   ``It's quite the most comprehensive change I've been associated
with since I've been in the Legislature,'' said Democratic Sen. Bob
Cullison, president pro tempore of the Senate. ``Maybe this plan has
merit. I hope it does.''

   BAIE-STE-CATHERINE, Quebec (AP) _ Prince Andrew has become the
prince of whales.
   Britain's Duke of York and his Duchess, Sarah Ferguson, adopted
an endangered beluga and named it White Mischief. The couple took
the action Monday while on a whale-watching tour from this port on
the St. Lawrence River about 125 miles northeast of Quebec City.
   The newest and largest addition to the Royal Family wasn't seen,
however, and in fact hasn't been seen since 1987.
   The royal couple, on a 13-day Canadian tour, join 44 other people
who have paid $5,000 each to adopt belugas _ white whales about 12
feet long. Prince Andrew's whale, however, was a gift from the
Charlevoix Tourist Association.
   The adopt-a-beluga program helps fund studies of the 500 whales
who live in this part of the polluted St. Lawrence River.
   The duke and duchess were due in Montreal today before flying on
to Saskatchewan.

charges of making terrorist threats.
   Tina Marie-Ledbetter, 26, of Camarillo, on Monday was ordered to
remain without bail in the Sybil Brand Institute for Women, said
Deputy District Attorney Susan Gruber.
   Fox, 27, received nearly all the letters over the course of a

Tracy Pollan, prosecutors said.
   ``Divorce Tracy or you are dead!'' one letter said.
   Fox did not attend Monday's arraignment, but he testified in a
preliminary hearing in May that he had worried about his family's
safety.
   Fox starred in the former television series ``Family Ties,'' and
was featured in such movies as ``Back to the Future'' and ``Bright

   A Pink Floyd rock concert that left St.

nightmare for local officials.
   The Venice city government offered to resign Monday after civic
groups condemned the officials for not providing hotel, first aid,
toilet and other facilities for the estimated 200,000 people who
attended the free show.
   Mayor Antonio Casellati said he and members of city council would
offer their resignations to the five political parties forming the
governing coalition. He said the parties had to decide on
regulations for use of the historic city.
   Angry citizens interrupted Casellati with shouts of ``Resign!''
and ``Get out!''
   Saturday night's concert by the British group set a record for
attendance at an Italian rock event. The band played on a floating
barge near St. Mark's, and fans watched from the piazza and from
rooftops.
   Workers were still cleaning Monday.

   Ronald Peters, who federal authorities say
was Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose's bookie, has begun his
two-year prison term on drug and tax charges.
   On Monday, before he left for the federal prison in Terre Haute,
Ind., Peters said he was looking forward to an end of publicity
surrounding his case.
   ``Seeing your face in the paper every day and on the news _ I'm
sure it's going to be a while before my face gets in the paper again
_ just to get away from all that for a while will be nice,'' Peters
said.
   Peters, 32, former owner of a restaurant and tanning salon in
this southwestern Ohio town, pleaded guilty to federal charges of
cocaine distribution and making false statements on his 1985 income
tax return.
   Major League baseball executives are investigating Rose's
gambling, and a federal grand jury in Cincinnati is investigating
whether he reported all taxable income. Rose denies any wrongdoing.
   Peters hopes to transfer to a halfway house after a year, and
said his sentence could be reduced by six months for good behavior.
   He said he will live in a dormitory at the prison, which has
tennis courts, a putting green and educational courses. Peters is a
former golf teaching professional.

   Courtroom spectators cheered Monday as a
judge upheld an anti-loitering ordinance designed to rid streets of
drug dealers.
   The 4-month-old city ordinance was challenged by attorneys for
four men arrested under the law and by the southwest Michigan
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. They argued that the
law violated the constitutional right of freedom of association.
   District Judge Quinn Benson ruled the city had a ``compelling
interest to stem the flow of drugs'' which outweighed any potential
infringement on the right of people to associate with drug dealers.
   City Attorney Robert Cinabro and lawyers representing four
neighborhood groups argued that without the ordinance, the rights of
residents to lead peaceful, safe lives would be violated.
   ACLU attorney Robert Travis argued that if the ordinance was not
overturned, then it should be amended to allow the arrest only of a
person having intent to use or sell drugs.
   The ACLU said it had not decided whether to appeal Benson's
ruling.
   Under the law, those who knowingly loiter in places where drugs
are used or sold may be arrested.
   Benson's ruling was cheered by Mattie Jordan, executive director
of the Northside Association for Community Development. ``This is
going to clean our streets up,'' she said. ``At least the police are
left a tool to fight the war.''
   City police have made 33 arrests since May, said Capt. Scott
Dolfman of the department's Special Investigations Unit.
   ``We've allowed citizens of the area freedom of movement in their
neighborhoods again,'' Dolfman said.
   Although other cities around the country have similar laws, the
only similar ordinance in Michigan is in Detroit.

   Hurricane Dalilia swirled toward Hawaii on Monday
on a course that would take it 150 miles south of the state's
southernmost island, meteorologists said.
   ``Anything can happen. The way it looks now we may get a little
from it, but not much,'' said Edmund Manning of the Central Pacific
Hurricane Center here. ``But then you can't be too optimistic.''
   At 2 p.m. HST Monday, the hurricane was 630 miles east-southeast
of Hawaii Island, southernmost in the chain, moving west at 20 mph,
Manning said. Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 mph; a storm
is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph. Wind
gusted up to 90 mph.
   At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to pass
south of Hawaii Island, the ``Big Island,'' on Tuesday night.
However, the center said a slight change in direction would bring
the hurricane closer to the state.
   A tropical storm watch was issued for the island at 5 p.m. HST,
which means winds up to 73 mph, large waves and heavy rains might
hit the island, the center said.
   An Air Force reconaissance plane from Keesler Air Force Base in
Biloxi, Miss., was scheduled to fly through the storm Tuesday to
collect data on its intensity and direction, said Clarence Lee, head
of the hurricane center.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of Oahu and roared over the top of Kauai with
winds up to 117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.
   Manning said it was too early to predict with certainty how
Dalilia would affect Hawaii's weather.
   ``A lot depends on how close Dalilia moves to the Islands,'' he
said. ``Some increase in showers and winds will likely result,
especially on the Big Island. There will also be some surf.''
   Manning said wave action associated with a fast-moving hurricane
like Dalilia tends to bunch up and arrive close to the passage of
the center. Surf on Hawaii Island's southern beaches was not
expected to increase until midday Tuesday, he said.
   Harry Kim, Hawaii County Civil Defense administrator, called a
briefing Monday with Hawaii Island agencies responsible for
monitoring surf. ``At this time, it seems like the worst we will
have is surf problems,'' Kim said.

   The dozen heavily armed officers abandoned
their cars haphazardly on the street and raced across the housing
project's muddy yard, their guns aimed at the doors, the windows.
   Though trying to ignore the children setting off firecrackers
next door in a belated Fourth of July celebration, they flinched
occasionally as the explosions went off.
   These guys were on edge. For two months, the members of the U.S.
Marshals Service and local police had worked for the Street Terror
Offender Program that nabbed 456 fugitives wanted on drug or
drug-related homicide charges in the Washington-Baltimore area.
   On this dreary July afternoon, they stormed into the southeast
Washington home in search of a 40-year-old fugitive, James Alston.
According to the officers, Alston failed to appear on a cocaine
distribution charge and violated parole.
   The officers had been briefed at their Navy Yard headquarters on
the home's basic layout, but they had no idea whether anyone inside
would be armed, waiting for them. So they kept their guns drawn,
wore bulletproof vests _ some of them weighing up to 35 pounds _ and
carefully scanned each room.
   Ten officers remained outside, making sure no one escaped or
tossed contraband out a window.
   There was no resistance as the entry team barged into the home
and discovered a young woman and her baby on the living room couch.
   Upstairs, past the bathroom door hanging by one hinge to the
rotting door frame, they found six men and a woman. Some already had
injected heroin. Others were preparing to do so. One man had a
needle sticking into his ankle, and it pulled when he jerked his
leg. Blood dripped down, soaking into his white canvas shoe.
   One by one, the entry team sent the addicts down the stairs to
fellow officers, ordering them to keep their hands on their heads.
They were directed to keep their fingers entwined, palms outward,
but the maneuver was beyond them.
   Sullenly, quietly, the addicts walked downstairs. They provided
their names and whatever identification they carried. At least one
would turn out to be false.
   ``Ever been in jail?'' one was asked.
   ``No.''
   ``Oh, come on!''
   ``No.''
   ``When's the last time you were in jail?''
   ``About a month and a half ago.''
   And so it went, with officers peering at the men's faces and
comparing them with a grainy photocopy of Alston's picture.
   Eventually a wiry man came down the stairs. He said his name was
Bradley, but he matched the photo. At an officer's direction, he sat
on the couch beside the other refugees from the shooting rooms.
   An officer confronted the man and asked if he was ``Mr. Alston.''
   The man smiled slightly as he nodded his head, resigned to the
inevitable.
   ``That's what I like about him,'' said an officer as Alston was
escorted outside. ``The guy's honest.''
   Operation STOP, which targeted fugitives for eight weeks starting
May 22, eventually arrested 25 people on drug-related homicide
charges. The other 431, including Alston, had at least three
previous felony drug arrests or convictions and were wanted on new
charges.
   Although 62 percent of those arrested were considered armed and
dangerous, no shots were fired during the raids, U.S. Marshals
Service Director Stanley Morris said Monday when the results were
announced.
   The $1.3 million federal program _ involving 56 federal marshals
and 34 local officers from the District of Columbia, the surrounding
suburbs and Baltimore _ was shut down after eight weeks even though
another 229 people targeted for arrest remain at large, the Marshals
Service said.
   ``People get tired,'' Morris said in an interview when asked why
the program ended before all the suspects were arrested.
   ``Eight weeks is a long time. Our experience is that's about ...
the length of time you can run an operation like this without people
starting to get homesick, a little careless and start to lose their
edge.''
   Back in southeast Washington, the officers were on alert.
   ``Until we leave, we're in control,'' bellowed Metropolitan
Police Department Sgt. Ricky Barrow. ``If you want to get up, ask
somebody...
   ``What we've seen today gives us about carte blanche to come in
here anytime we want,'' he lectured the woman who rents the home,
the woman whom a tipster had identified as Alston's girlfriend.
``Everything leads us to believe you're running a crack house,
heroin,'' he said as she shook her head, saying there's no crack.
   The officers eventually freed everyone but Alston, even though
they were caught shooting heroin and two full hypodermic needles
were found in a dish on a bedroom dresser.
   ``Why clog up the system?'' said one officer.
   Before the six-hour series of raids was over about two dozen
addicts and squatters had been rousted.
   Half were found in a well-known shooting gallery the team has
raided repeatedly. After ordering the addicts to lie down on the
rain-drenched sidewalk and checking their identification, the
officers ``cut them loose,''
   One marshal told an addict familiar to such busts, ``See you
later.''

<TEXT>
   A second former federal housing official is
refusing to testify about his role in the scandal-riddled Department
of Housing and Urban Development.
   Hunter Cushing, a former deputy assistant HUD secretary, invoked
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination Monday before a
House subcommittee investigating HUD operations.
   Meanwhile, subcommittee chairman Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said
Monday his panel is not considering granting immunity to anyone.
   Lawyers for former HUD official Deborah Gore Dean have met with
Lantos and the subcommittee staff, but no deal was reached that
would prevent her testimony from being used against her in some
possible prosecution.
   Last month, Ms. Dean, who was executive assistant to former HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr., also invoked constitutional protection
in refusing to testify.
   Cushing told the panel he hoped to testify ``at the appropriate
time,'' but said he had not received enough documents from the
agency to allow him to prepare for his testimony.
   ``In these circumstances, until I've had an opportunity to review
all the transactions that may be discussed ... I have decided to
follow my counsel's advice and assert my Fifth Amendment rights in
response to questions concerning activities at HUD,'' Cushing said.
   The subcommittee is investigating allegations of
influence-peddling, abuse and mismanagement at the agency. Current
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has suspended three HUD programs and ordered
an agency-wide review.
   Other witnesses in the investigation have testified that Ms. Dean
used her authority at HUD to direct funds to developers who used
consultants with political connections during the Reagan
administration.
   One of those consultants, Fred Bush, who has been nominated to be
ambassador to Luxembourg, has told the panel one of his colleagues
had been directed by Cushing to seek out Ms. Dean in securing
funding for a project.
   Lantos labeled ``absurd'' a request by Cushing that subcommittee
members submit their questions to him in advance.
   Cushing is now a deputy assistant secretary for loan programs at
the Commerce Department. A senior department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Cushing went on unpaid leave about a
week ago at the urging of the department.
   Earlier Monday, former HUD Secretary Carla Hills defended her
role in helping persuade Pierce to ease restrictions on DRG Funding
Corp., a client company that eventually cost the government millions
of dollars in bad loans.
   ``I don't disagree that the company had misbehaved and was being
spanked ... thrashed if you like and you feel that it should be
strung up,'' Ms. Hills said. DRG hired her law firm in 1981 to
represent it in housing matters.
   HUD has indefinitely suspended the company frm doing government
work. Congressional investigators say the lender cost the government
at least $69.5 million in bad loans and that the figure could rise
to $300 million.
   Ms. Hills told the House panel she was hired because of her
housing expertise and not because of any influence she might still
have at the department. Currently the U.S. trade representative, Ms.
Hills served as HUD secretary during the Ford administration.
   She said DRG paid $33,500 for her representation, including a
one-hour meeting with then-Secretary Pierce.
   Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee sent a bill
including funds for HUD to the full House _ but without money for a
housing rehabilitation program involved in the investigation.
   With tens of millions of dollars still unspent in the program,
the committee directed HUD to issue rules prohibiting the use of
consultants by companies lobbying the agency for approval of their
projects.

<HEAD>Commodity Credit Farm Investments Remain Low</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The taxpayer's investment in surplus farm
commodities continues to show a sharp decline from last year's
levels, largely as a result of drought-reduced crop production in
1988 and rising market prices.
   An Agriculture Department report released Monday showed the
Commodity Credit Corp. had $13.5 billion invested in price support
loans and actual inventories as of May 31. That included $9.1
billion in loans outstanding, and $4.4 billion in government-owned
commodities, said the report by Keith Bjerke, the CCC's executive
vice president.
   A year earlier, on May 31, 1988, the CCC had an investment of
$23.1 billion, including $14.3 billion in loans outstanding and $8.8
billion in inventories.
   The CCC finances various price support operations of the
department, including those for wheat, feed grains, rice, tobacco,
cotton, soybeans, dairy products, honey and sugar.
   In the case of the major grain crops, the 1988 drought reduced
production and pushed up prices. That reduced the need for price
support loans and forfeitures, which means the CCC takes over
ownership of crops when farmers opt not to repay the loans.
   When market prices are high enough, it's usual for farmers to pay
off the loans and use or sell as they choose.
   The farmer-owned grain reserve, which enables wheat and feed
grains to be stored and kept off the market under government loan
until prices rise enough to trigger their release, consisted of 287
million bushels of wheat valued at more than $1 billion as of May
31, the report said.
   Corn and other feed grains in the reserve totaled more than 1.03
billion bushels valued at $2.57 billion.
   The total value of commodities acquired by CCC in the first eight
months of the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1 was $1.72 billion,
the report said. In the same period of 1987-88, CCC acquired
products valued at $9.62 billion.
   Net losses to CCC totaled about $3.52 billion through May 31, the
report said, compared with a loss of more than $10 billion in the
same eight months of 1987-88. The decline was mainly due to the
smaller volume of grain moving into CCC inventories, and reduced
payments to farmers.
   Dairy inventories held by CCC also continued to edge down from
the high levels of a few years ago.
   As of May 31, for example, total holding were reported at 567.6
million pounds of products valued at $759.4 million, compared with
715.9 million pounds with a CCC investment of $820.1 million.
   Inventories of dried milk and cheese were down sharply, but the
butter stockpile was up from a year ago.

   Agriculture Department scientists are working
on an edible, nearly invisible coating made from milk that could
extend the shelf life of fruit and vegetables.
   Attila E. Pavlath, a chemist with the department's Agricultural
Research Service, said tests are concentrating on a film based on
casein, a milk protein. A small amount of vitamin C is added to help
protect against browning.
   Pavlath, who works at the agency's research laboratory in Albany,
Calif., said in a report released here on Monday that small pieces
of sliced and peeled apple dipped in the coating stayed fresh for
several days. Unprotected pieces shriveled and turned brown within a
few hours.
   The scientists want to make the film thinner, a process that
might take two more years, Pavlath said.
   Films that ``the tongue cannot feel and the taste buds cannot
detect'' also could be made from protein in soybeans, corn and
wheat, the report said.
   ``Some people who like fresh produce don't necessarily want to
spend time in their kitchen washing, slicing, peeling, pitting and
paring,'' Pavlath said. ``It's part of the trend toward buying food
that is ready to use and easy to store.''
   A successful coating would allow more types of produce to be
pre-sliced and packaged. Such coatings may have other potential
uses, perhaps for keeping fillings in pizzas or preventing pies from
soaking the crust.
   Unlike waxes on cucumbers or other edible coatings such as the
``skin'' on sausages, new films could be modified to add flavors or
colors to standard fare, Pavlath said.
   One possibility, he said, would be fresh sliced pears protected
with a somewhat thicker protein coating flavored with red cherries.
   John M. Krochta, a former chemical engineer at the Albany
laboratory who is now at the University of California, Davis, said
an ideal edible coating should keep out microbes that promote
softening, browning, mold and other types of decay.
   The coating should also trap vital moisture in produce to keep it
fresh, yet enable it to ``breathe'' by taking in oxygen and giving
off carbon dioxide, he said.

   John A. Stevenson, the Ohio state executive
director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service,
has been named as the No. 2 official in the Agriculture Department
agency.
   Undersecretary Richard Crowder said that Stevenson ``brings with
him first-hand experience and knowledge of our complex farm
programs.'' The position of associate administrator, as it is known,
pays $71,800 a year.
   Stevenson, who lives in Circleville, has been Ohio state
executive director for four years. He has been farming since 1958
and has an 800-acre operation in partnership with his daughter in
Pickaway County.

   Managers of a key Star Wars experiment who
claim major progress with a potential anti-missile weapon say
Congress' budget cuts leave the futuristic space defense program
``up in the air.''
   ``The real issue is, what is the funding for SDI?'' said Air
Force Col. Thomas Meyer, the head of the Strategic Defense
Initiative Organization's office of directed energy.
   ``It's difficult for me to tell you when we'll have a weapon in
space without a clear definition of what our future funding is. And
it's continuing to be up in the air,'' Meyer told reporters.
   He spoke at a Pentagon news conference Monday on the results of
SDI's latest experiment, which for the first time shot a beam of
atomic particles into the heavens.
   The BEAR _ or Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket _ was considered a
primary step in the Pentagon's reseach into the lasers, beam
accelerators and other futuristic weapons to shoot down nuclear
missiles.
   Meyer said elements of the experiment have produced
``on-the-shelf hardware,'' but that some engineering problems still
need to be worked out.
   ``It only takes the money to put it together ... and that's when
we'll get the weapon,'' he said.
   The $60 million experiment, launched over White Sands Missile
Range in New Mexico last Thursday, was conducted to test how a
neutral particle beam accelerator would work in space.
   The SDI system would make use of particle beams as a potential
anti-missile weapon. A beam would be shot across space to determine
whether an object fired into the sky is a decoy or an enemy warhead.
Also, the beam could be used to disable such a missile.
   Last week's experiment involved lifting into space _ just for a
few minutes _ a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Aires
rocket. Before the rocket returned to earth, the accelerator was
turned on and scientists collected data on how it worked and how the
particle beams moved.
   Meyer and his aides declared the test a success, displaying a
fuzzy black and white video tape of the bright, pulsing beam as it
emerged from the rocket.
   Meyer said the experiment showed that the complex equipment
needed to produce the beam could be made compactly, survive being
shot into space, and function well.
   ``We took a laboratory experiment and showed .. it can be
operated autonomously in space. It is a major achievement, both in
technology and engineering,'' Meyer said.
   Overall, Meyer said, the experiment clearly ``demonstrates the
promise (of SDI) that we have talked about all along.''
   The director said the program's designers and scientists also
wanted to test how the beam acted in space and how space affected
the beam.
   The test came as Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has been
fending off budget cuts directed at the billion-dollar program by
Capitol Hill.
   Last month, the House Armed Services Committee voted to slash
$1.1 billion from Cheney's budget for the anti-missile program. By
voice vote, the committee approved a $3.5 billion budget for SDI,
considerably less than the $4.6 billion President Bush proposed for
the program.
   On Friday, the Senate Armed Services Committee reduced the
administration's request to $4.5 billion.

   House tax-writers seem intent on changing the
catastrophic health program for retirees, but they apparently will
have to do it without cutting the tax on capital gains.
   In the face of intense lobbying, the House Ways and Means
Committee was working on a plan today that could reduce both the
special tax bite on older Americans and some benefits from
catastrophic health insurance.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the committee chairman, said after
a fruitless day of negotiating Monday that his own proposal for
solving the catastrophic care problem will not include a cut in the
capital gains tax.
   Asked why, he responded, ``Because I'm a Democrat.''
   President Bush has proposed a capital gains cut as a way to raise
revenue, although not necessarily for financing the catastrophic
program. Many Democrats are reluctant to go along because most of
the direct benefit from a lower tax on capital gains _ profits from
the sale of stocks and other investments _ would go to people with
incomes over $100,000 a year.
   The committee is working on a bill to raise $5.3 billion in new
revenue for deficit reduction in the budget year that begins Oct. 1.
The committee is likely to attach to that bill several tax
amendments, including measures extending a handful of tax benefits
that are expiring and whatever agreement can be reached on
catastrophic insurance. Rostenkowski's statement Monday left some
committee members wondering where they would find the revenue to pay
for those tax benefits.
   Although Bush contends a lower capital gains rate would boost
revenues several years into the future, Democrats say it likely
would be a money-loser after the first year, when many investors
would find it beneficial to sell some assets.
   But a congressional source said Monday night the Bush
administration is willing to accept an increase in the wage ceiling
on which the hospitalization part of Social Security taxes is
levied, raising revenues without raising tax rates.
   The extra revenue would be aimed at easing, but not completely
eliminating, the income surtax on elderly Americans with high
incomes that finances catastrophic health insurance coverage for
Medicare recipients.
   Administration tax officials told the committee in a closed
session Monday the proposal by Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., was
``generally acceptable.'' The option would increase the wage base on
which the 2.9 percent payroll tax for Medicare coverage is levied
from $50,700 to $60,000 in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, and
make state and local government employees subject to the tax for the
first time.
   Members of the committee make no effort to disguise their concern
about the catastrophic program. That is because many older Americans
_ who are paying for most of the program _ don't like the financing
mechanism.
   Members say most of the fire has come from higher-income
retirees, some of whom are paying a surtax of up to $800 this year
so older people with low incomes can also be protected against some
of the costs of a catastrophic illness.
   The people who are paying the most insist the expense of
providing catastrophic protection for the poor should be borne by
society in general.
   For 1989, the surtax is 15 percent of a retiree's ordinary income
tax above $150. About 59 percent of retirees pay no surtax at all;
5.6 percent are paying the full $800.
   The rest of the cost of the insurance is paid by most persons 65
and older through a $4 increase in the $27.90 monthly premium they
already pay for doctors' fees coverage.
   A plan under discussion Monday _ but gaining little support _
would have eliminated the surtax and transferred more of the cost to
elderly people with lower incomes and to workers in general.

   George Bush's vision of a ``kinder, gentler
nation'' may collapse under the weight of a severe economic crisis
that forces a leaner, meaner society to cancel social programs for
the poor and elderly, an expert believes.
   Amitai Etzioni, director of the Center for Policy Research at the
George Washington University, said he and other experts believe the
United States may soon face an economic disruption so severe that
government spending would be ``cut into the bone,'' resulting in
what he called a ``meaner'' society.
   ``A major, major economic shakedown could result in a 10-year
belt-tightening,'' he said Monday following a keynote address to the
general assembly of the World Future Society. ``If that happens
society will find it very difficult to be generous and gentler and
kinder. Belt tightening almost inevitably leads to a meaner, more
conflict-filled society.''
   Etzioni said he can't guarantee there will be such a serious
national financial shakedown, but he noted: ``The longer we delay
our economic solutions, the severer the crisis will be. I would
think that American society is not about to become kinder and
gentler.''
   Bush, in his speech accepting the Republican nomination for
president last August, pledged a ``kinder, gentler nation'' and that
became a theme of his campaign.
   Etzioni said current efforts by Congress and the Bush
administration to cut the federal deficit by reducing government
spending increases are ``some extremely minor trimming, just window
dressing and adjustments.''
   ``The belt-tightening I'm talking about would be larger by an
order of 10,'' said Etzioni. In such an event, he said, ``our
society will not be able to afford the essentials of decent and safe
social programs ... we will not only be unable to afford the
luxuries, we will have to cut into the bone.''
   He described a ``meaner'' society as one doing away with programs
like Head Start, which is designed to help the early education of
poor children, and ``taking mental patients and throwing them into
the street.''
   ``It means cutting down on police forces, school lunches, make it
tough for handicapped to apply for Social Security, taxing the
elderly for Medicare,'' said Etzioni. ``Above all, (it means) using
Social Security to cover deficits.''
   Averting such an economic crisis, he said, may require a major
change that would allow the U.S. economy to grow at a faster pace.
   But he said he doesn't believe the political parties have shown
the willingness to deal with such a tough issue.
   Etzioni is also a visiting professor at the Harvard Business
School and author of a book called ``The Moral Dimension'' which
deals with social sciences and economics.
   The five-day meeting of the World Future Society concludes on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Congress Would Strip Parks Power From Interior Secretary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A move to sharply limit the interior
secretary's power over the National Park Service is headed to the
Senate amid complaints that park employees have been intimidated by
administration officials.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., is expressing optimism that anger over
decisions by top Interior Department officials is strong enough to
push through a measure that was not considered by the Senate last
year.
   ``Individual senators have contacted me concerned about the
undermining of park professionals,'' he said.
   The House, by voice vote, approved legislation Monday that would
give the head of the National Park Service a fixed term and make the
person answerable directly to Congress.
   Vento, chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on national
parks and public lands, said the measure would give more power to
professional park employees who have been ``harassed, intimidated
and drummed out of the service'' by administration policies.
   Supporters said environmental concerns were being swept aside by
businesses interested in using the parks for commercial development.
   Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., told of the Reagan administration's
approval Jan. 19 of ski lift construction over the Appalachian Trail
in Vermont that was opposed by the Interior Department's career
staff.
   He said the career staff's opposition was reversed when the
proposal reached the top political appointees in Washington.
   ``Special interests have been better represented than the assets
of the parks,'' Vento said. ``The way they do that is by suppressing
the professionals.''
   The legislation would require the president to nominate a park
service director who would be confirmed by the Senate for a
five-year term that could not be terminated except for just cause.
   The interior secretary would relinquish power over the parks,
including hiring of personnel, keeping only the power over the
budget and cabinet policy authority.
   The Park Service director now is appointed by the president and
is not subject to Senate confirmation.
   Opponents of the bill, led by Rep. John Rhodes, R-Ariz., tried
unsuccessfully to change the measure. They say President Bush will
veto the bill if it passes unchanged in the Senate.
   Although the bill was approved by voice vote, the key vote came
on Rhodes' amendment that would have eliminated all provisions of
the bill except the one requiring the director to be confirmed by
the Senate. It failed 148-251.
   Although that margin was wide, supporters of the bill would have
to get more votes to override a presidential veto.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan told the House Interior Committee
this year he would recommend a veto if the bill passed in its
present form, according to department spokesman Tom Wilson.
   Steve Whitney, of the Wilderness Society, which pushed for the
legislation, emphasized the environmental damage that could occur
when the professionals are ignored.
   He said the interior secretary's office last year decided to
allow oil and gas exploration in the Florida's Big Cypress National
Preserve, despite the objections of all the professionals in the
department.
   ``This is the Everglades,'' said Whitney. ``It is extraordinarily
biologically rich and fragile.''
   He said the Wilderness Society sued to stop the exploration,
which would have required extensive use of explosives. The day a
judge was to hear arguments for an injunction, two weeks after
exploration work began, the Interior Department stopped the project.

   President Bush traces his ancestry to
religious dissenters who fled here for the New World, according to a
city archivist who says the president also is a distant relative of
Vice President Dan Quayle.
   The archivist, Theo Schelhaas, presented Bush with a copy of his
family tree Monday, showing his links to an English couple who
married in Leiden in 1603. The president was in the Netherlands for
a 24-hour stop, the last in his 10-day journey.
   Bush ``appreciated very much that his lineage had been fleshed
out'' said Pieter de Baar, a research assistant for Schelhaas.
   A small community of English Protestant dissenters lived in
Leiden for more than a decade before setting sail for America in the
early 17th century.
   Bush is a direct, 12th generation descendant of Francis Cooke and
his Canterbury-born wife, Hester Mahieu, according to Schelhaas'
records.
   Little is known about the Cookes except their marriage date, June
4, 1603, and that they had three children, including their daughter
Jane Cooke, a Bush ancestor born here in 1615.
   According to the Leiden records, Bush's roots can also be traced
to another Pilgrim family, the sisters Abigail and Sarah Jenney,
both born in Leiden and daughters of a brewer's apprentice, John
Jenney, and his wife Sarah Carey.
   Bush's father was related to Abigail Jenney as well as to the
Cookes, and his mother is a descendant of Sarah.
   Bush, in his remarks at St. Peter's Church in Leiden, joked:
``I'm glad to be back with my cousins because we fondly remember
Aunt Abigail back there those many years ago.''
   De Baar said the records show the president also is a distant
relative of Vice President Dan Quayle, with some branches of their
ancestry going back to a 14th century family living on the Isle of
Man, and of archivist Schelhaas himself.
   ``You might say they're cousins in the 35th degree,'' De Baar
said, referring to Bush and Quayle.
   Leiden's mayor, G.H. Goekoop, also mentioned Bush's roots, and
pointed out that two other American presidents, William Howard Taft
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, had ancestors in Leiden.
   ``Yes, here in Leiden not only the Dutch and American nations
come together, indeed, even the families of Democratic and
Republican presidents are linked,'' Goekoop said. ``We believe the
American reality began right here when the Pilgrims asked for
refuge.''

<HEAD>Escort, Lynx Owners Face Recall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owners of 518,000 subcompact Fords and
Mercuries face a recall order from the company following a federal
investigation into 652 reports of engine fires.
   The cars are among 2 million Ford cars and trucks affected by
safety and environmental recalls ordered Monday. In a separate
action, investigations were announced by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration into other alleged safety defects in
1.6 million Ford vehicles.
   The alleged engine fire problem resulting from oil leaks in 1984
and 1985{ Ford Escort, Mercury Lynx and Ford EXP models has been
blamed for two deaths and nine injuries, said NHTSA spokesman Tim
Hurd.
   ``We urge motorists with these cars to have the safety work
performed. There is no advanced warning except smoke coming out of
the hood,'' said Hurd. ``They could be walking away, turn around and
find their engine on fire.''
   The agency began investigating the engine fire problem in Ford
subcompacts in December 1986.
   The engine fire recall was going out to owners of 296,000 1984
Escort, EXP and Lynx automobiles. Some of the cars had been found to
have cracks in the engine which could leak oil onto exhaust
manifolds.
   Also, owners of 222,000 1985{ model Escort and Lynx cars were
being told a rocker-cover gasket, also called a valve gasket, could
leak, allowing oil to drip onto the manifolds. No Escort or Lynx
cars were designated 1985 models.
   The company acknowledged that both oil leak problems could cause
engine fires.
   Ford spokesman Michael Parris said the company received two
reports of hand burns, most likely sustained when the owner was
putting out a fire. NHTSA, in its monthly Defect Investigation
Report, did not give details of the fatality or injury reports it
received.
   New investigations announced in the monthly report Monday were:
   _1987-88 Taurus and Thunderbird for power seat electrical shorts
that allegedly caused fires in at least two incidents. The agency
received five complaints, with 295,000 of the cars on the road.
   _1986-87 Taurus models, for allegations of belt buckle failure,
resulting from five complaints among 350,000 cars.
   _1986-87 Ford F-350 pickup trucks and 1986-87 Ford Ranger trucks,
for reports of broken gearshift levers in manual transmission
models. The agency said it had nine complaints and had not
determined how many such vehicles were covered by the inquiry.
   _1984-88 Ford F-series trucks, for alleged clutch failure. NHTSA
has had 13 complaints, with about 900,000 trucks in use.
   _1988-89 Mustangs, four complaints of fires starting under the
dash, potentially affecting 100,000 cars.
   Other new investigations cover 13,000 1985 Toyota vans for an
alleged failure in the steering gear box, an undetermined number of
1989 Mitsubishi Monteros for a possible fuel hose problem, and
200,000 1987-86 GM light trucks for a suspension system ball joint
failure.
   NHTSA also closed investigations into several 1980-84 Ford
models, saying there was no evidence of a trend in parking brake
failures. It likewise closed an inquiry involving 1986-88 Taurus and
Sable automobiles, saying no unreasonable risk was posed in
allegations of headrest problems.
   An investigation of 1983-86 Subaru cars for allegations of front
seat failure also was ended, finding no trend of defects.
   One of Monday's recalls involved about 28,000 1989 Ford Ranger
and Bronco II four-wheel-drive vehicles with automatic locking
front-wheel hubs. The company said some of the vehicles may have
been built without a locking key in the left front hubs, which could
cause the wheel to fall off.
   The company also said it was recalling about 1.4 million 1985-87
cars to correct a problem with emissions control systems stemming
from the fuel injectors, engine control modules or catalysts.
   Included in the recall are 1985-87 Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz
cars with 2.3-liter and 2.3-liter high output engines, 1986-87 Ford
Taurus and Sable cars with 2.5-liter engines and 1987 Ford Escort,
Mercury Lynx and Ford EXP vehicles with 1.0-liter engines.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities are at their highest level in more than two weeks.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $6.6 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.87 percent, up
from 7.76 percent last week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.67 percent, up from
7.50 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.96
percent on July 3 and six-month bills averaged 7.78 percent on June

   The discount rates understate the actual return to investors _
8.14 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9.801.10 and 8.09 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,612.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the

<HEAD>U.S. Offers Up to $250,000 Per Victim In Downed Iranian Jetliner
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is offering to pay up to
$250,000 per victim to the families who lost relatives when a U.S.
Navy cruiser shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf last
year.
   The State Department says, however, that the U.S. government will
only turn over the money if the Iranian government names an
``appropriate intermediary'' to disburse the funds.
   An intermediary _ possibly another government or an insurance
company _ is needed to make sure the proper people benefit from the
money, officials said Monday.
   Some 250 Iranians were among the 290 people killed on Iran Air
Flight 655 July 3, 1988, when the cruiser USS Vincennes mistakenly
fired on the jetliner.
   The payment plan, personally approved by President Bush, calls
for the United States to give the families of each full-time worker
$250,000, while the families of others will receive $100,000. To get
the money, families would have to waive legal claims against the
United States.
   The package could total $30 million, with the money coming from a
special department fund.
   ``Although the United States is not liable under international
law to pay compensation to the families of Flight 655 victims, on
July 11, 1988, President Reagan announced that in accordance with
the humanitarian traditions of our nation, the United States would
do so on an ex gratia basis,'' Boucher said in a statement.
   The commander of the Vincennes said he believed he was threatened
with attack when he fired the missile at Flight 655 after warning
the pilot.
   The United States has contacted officials in India, Italy,
Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Yugoslavia to have them relay
the offer to victims' families there.
   Although the countries have yet to respond, Boucher said the
United States is confident the offer will be accepted.
   ``The same offer has been communicated to the government of
Iran,'' he said. ``Unfortunately during the past year the government
of Iran has ignored repeated efforts by the United States to obtain
information from the families of the Iranian victims.'' Iran was
contacted through an unidentified channel.

   United States aid to the Afghan rebels will
continue despite reports that 30 rebel military leaders were
murdered in an ambush by a rival resistance commander.
   ``Our commitment to support the Mujahedeen is very clear,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday ``And the nature
and character of our support is unchanged and it will continue.''
   Boucher said the U.S. is still investigating the reports of the
internecine killings, which apparently took place July 9 in the
Fakhar Valley northwest of Kabul.
   ``We deplore this tragic and brutal act,'' he said. ``It can only
play into the hands of the enemies of a free Afghanistan. We urge
the Mujahedeen to focus on the vital work of improving unity and
cooperation.''
   Boucher said Peter Tomsen, Washington's special envoy to the
Mujahedeen interim government, is looking into the attack.
   Preliminary information indicates the rebels were ambushed by a
rival Mujahedeen commander affiliated with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
Boucher said. Hekmatyar heads a faction of Islamic fighters who
reportedly have received aid from Washington.
   ``The murdered commanders were returning from a strategy planning
session with Ahmad Shad Massoud,'' Boucher said, adding that Tomsen
met with one of Massoud's brothers last week.
   Pressed on whether the incident might prompt U.S. human rights
concerns, he said: ``We're looking into this incident and I'm sure
we'll draw the appropriate conclusions.''
   In the Netherlands, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
asked at a news conference about reports of stepped up U.S.
assistance to the rebels, who seek to bring down the Marxist
government in Kabul.
   ``The policy of the United States has not changed,'' he said.
``Our policy is to seek and support self-determination for the
Afghan people in a number of ways and the nature and character of
that support has not changed.''

<HEAD>Fishermen Stage Anti-Dredging Protest on Bay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 boat captains protested the
dredging of muck from the San Francisco Bay, which they say is
suffocating fish, devastating the fishing industry and creating
toxic hazards.
   Fishermen blew their horns and flew flags of protest on Monday to
call attention to the more than 10 million cubic yards of new
sediment that ends up in the Bay every year.
   Boats displayed banners that read ``Stop Choking Our Bay,''
``Stop the Dumping,'' and ``Muck Kills.''
   Bob Martin, 27, a recreational fisherman who has been fishing for
striped bass in the San Francisco Bay since he was a young boy, said
he was worried by the decline of the fish.
   ``Right now it's hardly worth fishing for them,'' he said. ``I
just hope we get to the point that if I have kids someday I can tell
them what a striped bass is instead of what it was.''
   ``We want the people of California to know, and the politicians
to know, and the Regional Water Board to know that our Bay just
cannot take anymore dumping of dredging spoils,'' said Keith Fraser,
former president of the United Anglers Association. ``We are at the
saturation point.''
   But Bill Prout, spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
which does most of the Bay dredging and oversees the rest, defended
dredging as a necessary means of maintaining shipping channels in
the naturally muddy area.
   ``We've been dredging here for 65 years and it hasn't killed off
all the fish up to this point,'' Prout said. ``The species here live
in the turbid environment.''
   Dredging critics also fear that an underground mountain of
dredged muck west of Alcatraz Island poses a navigational and toxic
hazard. The Alcatraz dump site is targeted for closure in December
1991, but critics want it closed immediately.
   Critics said seals and sea lions already have fled the Bay for
cleaner water, and striped bass and halibut populations have been
way down in recent years.
   Demonstrators want the muck hauled up the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta to shore up levees, or at least 25 miles out to sea where the
ocean depth drops abruptly from a few hundred feet to at least 3,000
feet.
   Prout said it costs between $2 and $3 per cubic yard to haul
sediment from the Port of Oakland to Alcatraz, compared to estimated
costs of up to $8 per cubic yard to haul it out to seas.
   ``There's not an easy answer to this problem,'' he said.
   Denny Larson of Citizens for a Better Environment conceded that
proposals to haul dredging spoils beyond the Bay will be costly, but
he said keeping open the Alcrataz dump site may pose greater costs.
   Dredging stirs up toxic chemicals like cadmium, mercury, nickel,
lead, zinc and petroleum hydrocarbons, said Greg Karras, a toxicity
specialist for Citizens for a Better Environment.
   Karras said about 40 percent of all dumped material ends up
recirculating in Bay waters, about 30 percent remains near Alcatraz
and another 30 percent is swept out to shallow ocean areas.
   ``We're creating toxic hot spots underwater,'' Karras said.

   The Supreme Court granted a stay of execution
early Tuesday for convicted killer James William Hamblen, hours
before he was scheduled to be executed in Florida's electric chair.
   The stay was granted to permit the justices to review an appeal
by Hamblen's lawyers, said Toni House, a spokeswoman for the high
court.
   Since the court is out of session and won't be back until
October, Hamblen's appeal cannot be heard until then, she noted.
   The stay of execution was granted without comment, she said.
   Hamblen had been scheduled to be executed at 7:01 a.m. EDT for
the April 24, 1984 robbery-murder of Laureen Jean Edwards, owner of
the Sensual Woman lingerie shop in Jacksonville.
   Hamblen, during his trial in 1984, fired his court-appointed
attorneys and pleaded guilty, agreeing he deserved the death
penalty. He also admitted killing his ex-girlfriend, Debbie Abbot in
Spring, Texas, earlier the same year.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers opened fire to break up
a small demonstration at the University of El Salvador, and eight
people were reported injured, including an American who broke his
leg while fleeing.
   Students said the soldiers fired to prevent the roughly 30
demonstrators from leaving the campus Monday night. But a military
officer said the troops were returning shots fired from inside the
school.
   No soldiers were reported hurt.
   The protest was called to demand that soldiers free Rene Cruz, an
economics student and leader of the General Association of
Salvadoran University Students. Students say soldiers arrested him
Sunday, but the army denied it.
   The military said in a statement on the demonstration that the
students committed ``acts of provocation against the troops that
guard and provide security to the University of El Salvador.''
   During the protest, police defused a car bomb 500 yards from the
1st Infantry Brigade headquarters, near the school, the statement
said. It did not say whether the military believed the protest and
the bomb were related.
   Several students, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
soldiers fired to keep the demonstrators from leaving the campus.
   But Col. Francisco Elena Fuentes, commander of the 1st Infantry
Brigade, said in a telephone interview that Soviet-made AK-47 rifles
were fired from inside the school and that firebombs were thrown.
   In television film of the disturbance, shots appeared to be
coming from one of the campus buildings.
   Ambulances were not allowed onto the campus until the shooting
stopped, two hours after the disturbance began, said a Red Cross
worker who requested anonymity. He said eight people were taken to
hospitals, including a man who identified himself as Robert Drennon,
33, of New York City.
   Drennon, who said he has been studying Spanish on a student
exchange program, told reporters: ``When I heard the shots I ran and
I broke my leg.''
   The Red Cross did not describe the injuries suffered by the other
seven protesters who were taken to the hospital.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, fighting for
nine years to overthrow the U.S.-backed government, said in a call
to a local radio station that its urban units were not involved in
the the university incident.

<HEAD>Briefs Filed in Divorce Battle for Embyos</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a divorcing couple who are
battling over control of seven frozen embryos have established key
differences over the donors' rights in an in-vitro fertilization
program.
   In a brief filed Monday, J. G. Christenberry, an attorney for
Mary Sue Davis, who is seeking the right to have the embryos
implanted in her, said that males have never had any control over
the reproductive process once they have fertilized an egg.
   ``The fact this case represents an artificial method of
fertilization and conception and that the gametes are in artificial
storage only allows the opportunity to artificially change a law of
nature which has been determined since the beginning of history,''
he wrote.
   But Charles Clifford, attorney for Junior Lewis Davis, said in a
brief filed in Circuit Court Friday that that to give Mary Davis the
sole right to decide what to do with the embryos would leave Junior
Davis ``only to ponder when and if he will be a father and what his
legal, emotional and psychological relationship will be with any
children (Mary Davis) may elect in her sole discretion to bear.''
   The trial is scheduled for Aug. 7.
   Junior Davis, 30, sued his 28-year-old wife for divorce in
February. In that suit he asked the court to ensure that his wife
could not have any of the seven frozen embryos that he had
fertilized implanted without his permission.
   Mary Davis has since counter-sued, and claims she can have the
embryos implanted if she so decides, regardless of her husband's
wishes or their marital status.
   Clifford, in his brief on behalf of Junior Davis, said the
embryos, which are in storage at the Knoxville hospital where the
Davises participated in an in-vitro fertilization program, are not
``persons'' under the law and thus can be treated as property.
   He also argued that both Junior Davis and Mary Davis ``have a
fundamental right to control'' their reproduction process, and the
decision should not be made by one party alone.
   Christenberry said that Junior Davis consented to his wife's
pregnancy when he entered the in-vitro fertilization program with
her.
   And he said Mary Davis' contribution to the in vitro program was
greater than her husband's because ``the process involved in
removing egg cells from her body is much more discomforting than the
sperm donation process.''
   In-vitro fertilization involves surgically removing a woman's
eggs from her ovaries and fertilizing them with a man's sperm in a
laboratory dish.

   For years, Northrop's chief test pilot
had to contain his enthusiasm for the progress of the top-secret
stealth bomber.
   But Bruce J. Hinds emerged Monday from the cloak of secrecy
surrounding the radar-evading B-2, as the aircraft itself left its
giant hangar and took to the air.
   The pilot, and Air Force test pilot Richard Couch, had high
praise for the arrowhead-shaped plane's handling characteristics.
   ``It was meant to fly,'' Hinds said. ``It likes to fly.''
   Hinds, 50, and the 43-year-old Couch applied terms such as
``nimble'' and ``beautiful'' to their sunrise test flight 10,000
feet above the Mojave Desert.
   For Hinds, a former Air Force test pilot who has flown 66
different aircraft including the U-2 spy plane and the F-104
Starfighter, the flight from a Northrop hangar to nearby Edwards Air
Force Base represented a rendezvous with history.
   ``I had always been fascinated with flying wings,'' Hinds said,
referring to the wing-shaped prototypes built by aviation mavericks
in the 1930s and 1940s on which the B-2 is based.
   The Northrop pilot couldn't indulge his curiosity publicly,
however. Little more than a year ago, the stealth bomber, with a
program price tag of more than $70 billion, did not officially
exist. For a decade, it lurked in the shadows of the Pentagon's
highly classified ``black programs.''
   Since Hinds was the bomber's chief test pilot, he had to maintain
the same vow of secrecy as the 32,000 other workers in the B-2
program.
   ``It's often the case with test pilots that they can't discuss
the airplane they're working on,'' said Northrop spokesman Tony
Cantafio.
   Still, Hinds crossed paths with other fliers at meetings of the
Society of Experimental Test Pilots. There, he listened to pilots
from earlier generations discuss test work from flying wings
conceived before he was born.
   As early as the 1930s, aviation pioneer Jack Northrop was
building such all-wing aircraft. Stubbornly, he contended the wings
had great load-carrying capacity, superior fuel economy and
aerodynamics.
   During World War II, the Germans built prototype all-wing
bombers. Today's B-2 shares an eery resemblance to a Horten bomber
built for the Luftwaffe but never flown in combat. According to
William Sweetman's reference work titled ``Stealth Bomber,'' at
war's end, German designers were working on a six-engine all-wing
jet bomber.
   ``With the flying wing, you get the feeling they should have kept
going,'' Hinds said. ``That whole series of planes was pretty
remarkable for its time.''
   Just as remarkable, Hinds said, is the B-2's advanced computer
controls that keep the flying wing stable in flight without aid of a
tail.
   ``It's like flying a conventional aircraft,'' he said.

   Hawaii Island residents were urged to stock up on
batteries, canned goods and other emergency supplies as Hurricane
Dalilia swirled toward the state.
   Late Monday, the hurricane was moving west at 20 mph several
hundred miles east-southeast of Hawaii Island, according to the
National Weather Service. Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75
mph, with gusts up to 90 mph.
   At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to pass
about 150 miles south of Hawaii Island tonight. However, the weather
service said a slight change in direction would bring the hurricane
closer to the state.
   ``Storms have a mind of their own,'' said lead forecaster Hans
Rosendal. ``We've put out a tropical storm watch in case Dalilia
strays from the path.''
   The weather watch issued Monday afternoon warned residents that
73 mph winds, large waves and heavy rain could hit the island, he
said. It was issued only for the island of Hawaii.
   An Air Force reconaissance plane from Keesler Air Force Base in
Biloxi, Miss., was scheduled to fly through the storm Tuesday to
collect data on its intensity and direction, according to the
Central Pacific Hurricane Center here.
   Dal said it was too early to predict with certainty how Dalilia
would affect Hawaii's weather.
   ``It depends how close it comes,'' he said. ``There would
probably at least be some heavy rain and high surf on the Big
Island. It's too early to say about Oahu and the rest of the state.''

   A congressional study of the nation's system
for guiding aircraft says some air traffic controllers work without
video screen information on altitude, speed and direction for up to
16 minutes.
   However, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Agency said Monday
safety had not been compromised, thanks to adequate backup systems.
   ``The long and short of it is that controllers are not working in
the blind when these things occur,'' Dick Stafford said. ``Backup
systems provide them with information _ not as good as the regular
information _ but we're not going to put more aircraft in the sky
than can be safely handled at any given time.''
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., on Monday released a draft of the
study he had commissioned in March 1988 from the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   He also released a companion draft of a GAO report on efforts to
reduce near collisions. It showed 231 of 326 such incidents
involving commercial flights in 1988 were classified as serious.
   But Stafford said incidents of near-midair collisions are
actually declining.
   He said the number of reports dropped by 33 percent in 1988 to
their lowest level since 1985. Through the first five months of
1989, he said near-collision reports were down another 23 percent
from the same period in 1988.
   In its study on the facilities used by air traffic controllers,
the GAO recommended Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner direct
the FAA to take action that would avert further interruptions of air
traffic functions.
   ``Computer capacity shortfalls at terminal area facilities are
widespread,'' the study said. ``FAA did not recognize these capacity
shortfalls until controllers began experiencing lost, flickering or
delayed data on their displays.''
   The FAA plans to overhaul the existing traffic control systems
with new equipment in the mid-to-late 1990s, but the report called
for Skinner and the FAA administrator to study available
alternatives for the next 10 years.
   The GAO found between June 1988 and June 1989, computers at 27 of
FAA's 63 larger airport radar control centers were overloaded.
   The study said the problem could worsen with a requirement, in
effect since July 1, that all planes flying within 30 miles of large
traffic control centers be equipped with transponders that transmit
altitude information. The requirement, which affects 44,000
additional aircraft, was designed to reduce near collisions.
   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which represents
nearly 300,000 operators of small planes, want that requirement
withdrawn.
   ``Adding additional workload to a system that is already severely
overloaded will further jeopardize the safety of the flying public
and general aviation in particular,'' said association spokeswoman
Patricia Weil.
   Lautenberg said it doesn't make sense ``if an effort to improve
safety at one level degrades it at another.''
   Steven Schlein, a spokesman for Lautenberg, chairman of the
Senate Transportation Appropriations subcommittee, noted air traffic
is being guided with 1960s technology.
   ``The technology will be 30 years old by the time the new
equipment comes in,'' Schlein said. ``They didn't have a contingency
plan for this, for what to do in the meantime.''
   The FAA plans to award a contract by Sept. 30 to Unisys Corp. to
acquire additional capacity for the air traffic computers, which
have been obsolete for years, according to the study.
   ``To supply the outdated processors, Unisys will have to restart
a production line because these computers, developed in the late
1960s, have not been manufactured since the 1970s,'' the study said.

   A boy who was impaled on an iron spike has a
metal plate in his jaw, some numbness in his mouth and a tooth
missing, but he's talking again and probably will leave the hospital
this week.
   Julio Castillo, 15, slipped on July 8 as he tried to climb a
6-foot-tall, wrought-iron fence to retrieve a baseball.
   A square spike about an inch wide entered his throat below his
jaw and came out his mouth.
   Wearing a bandage around his neck, Julio told reporters at a news
conference Monday that the ordeal didn't really hurt much, but that
he was afraid of ``them burning me with those things they were
cutting me out with.''
   Firefighters covered the boy with their coats to protect him from
sparks while they used torches to cut away a 4{-by-6{ foot section
of the iron fence.
   The boy was carried on the fence by ambulance to the hospital,
where firefighters scrubbed, put on gloves, went in the emergency
room and used an electric hacksaw to cut away most of the fence.
   ``I thank them a lot for saving my life,'' he said.
   Dr. Daniel Buchbinder, chief surgeon at the hospital where the
boy was treated, said Julio will have a metal plate holding two
parts of the jaw together for six months so the jaw won't have to be
wired shut while it is healing.

   A House subcommittee has approved a $14.4
billion foreign aid bill which increases the amount of money for a
plan to help the Philippines.
   The Appropriations Committee's foreign operations panel on Monday
added $30 million to the Philippines aid program, bringing the total
proposed U.S. share to $160 million for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1.
   But that figure is still $40 million below the amount Secretary
of State James A. Baker III pledged for the program at a recent
Tokyo meeting with other nations participating in the development
effort.

<HEAD>KAL Jury Picked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-member jury has been selected to decide a
suit which accuses Korean Air Lines of willful misconduct when one
of its passenger jets was shot down by Soviet planes in 1983,
killing all 269 people aboard.
   Families of 132 of the passengers killed when Flight 007 was
destroyed are suing KAL. They claim the plane's crew, due to a
navigational mistake deliberately left uncorrected, let the plane go
hundreds of miles off course over a period of several hours into
Soviet air space.
   After the six jurors and three alternates were chosen and sent
home for the day Monday, KAL lawyers asked U.S. District Judge
Aubrey Robinson to limit presentation of the conclusions of a report
on the shootdown by the International Civil Aviation Organization.
   The ICAO said Flight 007 had been off course for nearly 5{ hours
before it was destroyed.

<HEAD>Bush Urged to Veto Aid Restriction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush should veto legislation that
would block him using money from other countries for activities that
the U.S. Congress refuses to bankroll, according to Sen. Jesse Helms.
   ``This doesn't even make good nonsense because Congress doesn't
have the authority to do that,'' Helms, R-N.C., said Monday as
debate opened on an amendment offered by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to a State Department authorization bill.
   Moynihan's proposal arises from the Iran-Contra investigation,
when it was revealed that the Reagan administration solicited funds
from foreign nations to aid the Contra rebels in Nicaragua at a time
when Congress had barred using U.S. funds to provide such aid.
   During the hearings the countries were referred to by code names
such as ``Country One'' and ``Country Two'' and the like. But it was
clear that nations like Saudi Arabia and Brunei had contributed.

<UNK>Former Aide To President Chun Sentenced to 10 Months in Prison</UNK>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former director of the nation's
intelligence agency was convicted today and sentenced to 10 months
in prison for abusing power during the rule of disgraced former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Chang Se-dong, 52, was convicted by a three-judge panel of
building an opulent private residence for Chun with public funds
while serving as Chun's chief bodyguard from 1981 to 1984, a
politically powerful position.
   Chang headed the Agency for National Secuity Planning, the
country's intelligence agency, from 1985 until 1987, Chun's last
year in office.
   The residence was allegedly for use by Chun after retirement and
has been returned to the government for use by a foundation.
   In handing down the sentence in Seoul District Criminal Court,
Presiding Judge Hong Suk-chae said Chang had acted out of excessive
loyalty to Chun rather than being faithful to his job as chief
presidential bodyguard.
   Chang had maintained he was doing his job.
   The prosecution, which had demanded four years imprisonment, said
it would appeal the sentence. Defense lawyers also indicated they
would appeal.
   Chang was among dozens of Chun's former aides, relatives and
others who have been arrested on charges of influence peddling,
corruption and violations of human rights during the former
president's authoritarian seven-year rule.
   Chun, accused of misrule and human rights violations, apologized
to the nation in November and has been living in rural exile at a
Buddhist temple.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell sharply.
   The dollar ended trading at 142.35 yen, up 0.82 yen from Monday's
141.53-yen close. The index started at 141.55 yen and moved between
141.43 yen and 142.50 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 112.49
points, or 0.34 percent, closing at 33,343.73. The index has lost
more than 400 points since last Wednesday.
   The index fell as market players remained on the sidelines ahead
of the major national election for the upper house of Japan's
parliament Sunday, dealers said.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue said the number of issues
sold markedly outnumbered those purchased ``mainly because of
concerns over the elections, and the yen's losses against the
dollar.''
   A series of recent polls have predicted that the governing
Liberal Democratic Party will lose badly in the upcoming election.
Although senior party leaders say they will win at least 54 seats of
the 126 to be decided Sunday, analysts see that as a tough goal.
   The governing party has lost its popularity due to an
influence-peddling stock scandal, an unpopular sales tax and reports
about Prime Minister Sousuke Uno's affairs with women.
   In currency dealings, yen-selling pressure remained strong since
the dollar's higher opening Tuesday, but many market participants
were also reluctant to make major moves before the U.S. trade report
for June, traders said.
   The U.S. trade figure, which the U.S. Commerce Department is to
release later Tuesday in Washington, is considered an important
indicator of the health of the U.S. economy.

<HEAD>Priests Crusade Against Drug Paraphernalia Sold Next to Bread, Candy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Death threats to a pair of Roman Catholic priests
are a daily ritual now. They say it is proof that their crusade
against the sale of drug paraphernalia is paying off.
   At hundreds of stores throughout the city, an elementary school
pupil looking for candy can find himself shopping side-by-side with
an addict buying a new crack pipe, the priests say.
   ``You go in a store and what you see right off is bread, candy
and drug paraphernalia,'' said the Rev. Michael Pfleger. ``This is
teaching children that drugs are an ordinary part of life.''
   And death.
   ``Drugs are the No. 1 killer I've had to deal with,'' said
Pfleger, a white priest who for nearly 15 years has ministered to
the all-black congregation at St. Sabina's.
   Between them, Pfleger and the Rev. George Clements, whose
parishes are in the city's South Side, have attended hundreds of
funerals for junkies, drug pushers and bystanders killed in drug
warfare.
   ``In my neighborhood, it's an epidemic, a raging epidemic,'' said
Clements. ``Virtually no family has been left untouched.''
   Finally, it became too much for the priests, both of whom have
the added worry of their own adopted sons being exposed to and
possibly lured into drugs.
   ``Our effort is really to heighten the contradiction in a society
which says that it's legitimate to buy drug paraphernalia, but
illegal to take drugs,'' said Clements. ``That's the height of
hypocrisy.''
   That may stop soon.
   A bill outlawing the sale of drug paraphernalia was recently
passed by the state General Assembly. Gov. James R. Thompson is
expected to sign it.
   The priests say they've been meeting with local congressmen as a
first step toward a national ban.
   Their efforts have brought confrontations with store owners and
misdemeanor arrests for refusing to leave shops in Chicago and, in
Clements' case, in Shreveport, La.
   Each Saturday, Pfleger and 100 or so parishioners fan out to the
neighborhood liquor stores, groceries and video shops that openly
sell the drug gear. From Clements' Holy Angels Church, the priest
and parishioners make daily forays.
   Some of the stores have scales for weighing cocaine and
substances for diluting the drug. Most have the user's tools, such
as pipes, glass vials and capsules.
   In the last two months, about 400 stores have taken the
paraphernalia off shelves, the priests say. Those that don't readily
agree get repeated visits and threats of boycotts.
   Some doubt the usefulness of the priests' work.
   ``We pulled it off the shelf, no problem,'' said Ali Saleh, who
agreed to remove the paraphernalia from shelves at the F&amp;G Liquor
and Food Mart he manages. ``But there has to be a law against it or
people can just go down a block or two and they'll be selling the
same thing there.''
   As the priests' efforts have progressed, so have the threats.
   Not a night goes by without a half dozen telephoned threats,
usually between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., said Pfleger.
   Written death threats have been flung through church windows with
rocks.
   Clements, who is one of the nation's best-known black Catholic
priests and who officiated at last year's wedding of heavyweight
boxing champion Mike Tyson and actress Robin Givens, said someone
recently smashed his car window and tore out the radio and air
conditioning.
   A note read, ``The first of many. From your friendly drug
dealer.''
   ``Obviously, we're having an effect,'' Pfleger said.
   The priests now plan to take their fight against drugs further _
to the doorsteps of pushers.
   ``We want people to tell us where drugs are being sold,'' he
said. ``And when we find out, we'll put a sign up saying a drug
dealer lives here and the neighbors want him to leave the
neighborhood.''
   Pfleger acknowledged it could be dangerous.
   ``But fear is not going to do anything to stop us,'' he said.
``The only thing we're afraid of is not doing anything.''

<HEAD>Review Accepts Report Blaming Gander Crash on Icy Wings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judicial review has accepted an investigation
that found that icy wings, rather than a bomb, caused a 1985 plane
crash that killed 256 U.S. servicemen and crew in Gander,
Newfoundland, a newspaper said today.
   The review found no need to reopen the case, the paper said.
   The Canadian Aviation Safety Board probe was controversial
because five board members said icy wings caused the crash, while
the other four theorized that a bomb was to blame.
   Some board members also charged that evidence pointing to a
terrorist attack was withheld.
   Sources at the safety board and Department of Transport said the
review, ordered in March by Transport Minister Benoit Bouchard,
generally exonerates the board's staff investigators, the Toronto
Globe and Mail said.
   The newspaper said in today's editions that the review, written
by Justice Willard Estey, a former Supreme Court of Canada judge,
will be released Friday.
   The five-member majority on the investigatory board found that a
thin layer of ice reduced the lifting capacity of the wings of the
Arrow Air jet, causing the chartered aircraft to crash on takeoff on
Dec. 12, 1985.
   The paper quoted sources as saying the review gives no credence
to the bomb theory or to claims that evidence was withheld.
   The dissenters suggested a coverup by Canadian and U.S. agencies
sought to hide what they argued was a terrorist attack on the aging
DC-8 that was taking U.S. troops home for Christmas after a
peacekeeping tour in the Middle East.
   No evidence of a bomb has ever been presented, although the
dissenters say its absence demonstrates the wide-ranging nature of
the coverup.
   Safety board Chairman Ken Thorneycraft refused Monday to discuss
Estey's review. He said he was unaware of its findings, but added
that he had always been confident that any independent assessment of
the agency's investigation would conclude it was conducted
thoroughly and reached reasonable conclusions.
   Critics of the icing finding, including the U.S. Airline Pilots
Association, have accused the board of fabricating evidence in a bid
to blame the plane's pilots. Both pilots, six other crew members and
all 248 U.S. servicemen on board died in the crash _ the worst ever
in Canada.
   The Globe and Mail also said Les Filotas, one of the board's
dissenters, sent a letter to Estey saying Arro Air may have been
involved in ``arms-for-hostages exchanges conducted secretly on
behalf of highly placed individuals in the American administration
(and that) if so, there would have been strong motivation for
attempts to confound aspects of the investigation.''
   The letter, obtained through the Access to Information Act,
suggests the unsubstantiated link could also have been a motive for
targeting Air Arrow for a terrorist attack, the newspaper said.
   It said Estey returned the letter, dated April 2, unread to
Filotas.

   The pilot who survived an unconscious
800-mile flight and crash has been dismissed by an Arizona
corporation that he represented as a lawyer, a spokeswoman for the
company said.
   Thomas Root's Sonrise Management Services Co. had been
representing Sun Health Corp. in its effort to obtain a license from
the Federal Communications Commission to operate a FM radio station,
said Madeline Lutz, the corporation's education director.
   Sun Health, which owns and operates hospitals in Sun City and Sun
City West, dismissed the Washington attorney after his plane
splashed down Thursday into the ocean off the Bahamas, Ms. Lutz said
Monday.
   ``We were advised to hire him and he performed all of his
functions as our attorney well. But we felt that because of his
injury he might not be available to fully represent us,'' she said.
   The 36-year-old lawyer from Alexandria, Va., remained in a
Florida hospital in stable condition Monday; a hospital spokeswoman
predicted he would be there for another week.
   He planned to fly his small plane from Washington to Rocky Mount,
N.C., but told air traffic controllers he was having trouble
breathing, and apparently passed out until his plane ran out of fuel
and plunged into the sea near the Bahamas.

Meet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   America's first astronaut in the 1960s
space race with the Soviet Union opposes joint missions today, but
not for political reasons.
   ``I think it would be a step backwards to go that route,'' Alan
Shepard said Monday during a visit to the Space and Rocket Center
for Space Celebration '89 festivities. ``I would rather see us
develop the technology to have planetary travel _ manned and
unmanned.''
   A separate celebration of the 20th anniversary of the 1969 moon
walk, meanwhile, included some bitterness.
   About 40 aging German rocket scientists who helped build
America's space program expressed disappointment that one of their
brethren was not present for a reunion of the 20th anniversary
celebration of Americans landing on the moon.
   Arthur Rudolph, project manager for the Saturn 5 rocket at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, remained in voluntary
exile in his native West Germany, under threat of prosecution for
alleged Nazi war crimes if he returned to the United States.
   ``It's a shame for the United States to send out a man who did so
much for the United States,'' said scientist Konrad Dannenberg.
``Everyone here should be ashamed this thing happened.''
   Rudolph, now 84, retired in January 1970 after helping send two
spaceships to the moon and moved to San Jose, Calif., where he lived
in relative obscurity for 14 years.
   His tranquil retirement ended when the Justice Department's
Office of Special Investigations raised allegations that during
World War II he was involved in the deaths of thousands of
concentration camp prisoners who were forced to work in a V-2 rocket
factory where he was technical director. Those allegations were
backed up by some survivors.
   Rudolph left the country and returned to Hamburg, West Germany,
where a two-year investigation found no offense against Rudolph. His
West German citizenship was returned.
   Shepard, one of 12 Americans to walk on the moon, disagreed with
Apollo 11 moonwalker Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, who said during a trip
to Huntsville Saturday that America should pursue joint missions
with the Soviet Union and possibly Japan.
   ``I think our space technology level, in general, is ahead of the
Soviets,'' Shepard said.
   Shepard, now 65, rode a Huntsville-built Redstone rocket into
space on May 5, 1961, as the American space program rushed to catch
the Soviets, who had sent Yuri Gagarin into space on April 12.
   He returned to space in February 1971 on Apollo 14 and became the
fifth man to walk on the moon _ a feat never matched by the Soviet
Union. Shepard is now is a commercial real estate developer in
Houston.
   Meanwhile, children who weren't alive when man first landed on
the moon got a chance to guide another ``spacecraft'' to a lunar
landing Monday.
   Fifteen students worked at the Challenger Center's mock Mission
Control in Houston, while another group of children were ``flying''
in a simulator at a second Challenger Center in Greenbelt, Md. They
were helped by flight controllers who were in NASA's Mission Control
during Apollo 11's historic landing.
   The youths talked through headsets and completed checklists
before giving the go-ahead for the mock landing.
   The centers, built as a memorial to the seven astronauts who died
in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, offer youngsters a
chance to learn by participating in simulated missions.

<HEAD>Body Parts Found In Trash Trailer With Reported Mob Connection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators found human body parts amid four
tons of medical waste near a trash hauling company and said they
suspected a link with organized crime, according to a report today.
   Authorities are trying to determine whether the body parts _
arms, legs and part of a torso _ discovered in September belonged to
an mob execution victim or victims, and if so, whether other victims
were disposed of the same way.
   ``There were no fingers or other identifiable parts,'' a law
enforcement source told the Daily News.
   City and federal investigators got and executed a search warrant
for the company, National-Stage Carting, after a tip from a mob
informant, the report said.
   They found the parts in a refrigerated trailer full of medical
waste, which was packed in more than 50 boxes, parked on a side
street near the company in the Brooklyn borough.
   A spokesman for the city Department of Investigation, Ron Davis,
confirmed that the trailer contained body parts.
   The newspaper said the tractor-trailer was registered to
Rosendale Haulage, a Florida company with ties to Anthony Vulpis.
   Vulpis, National-Stage owner Angelo Paccione and a developer,
Fred Weiss, were indicted last month on federal charges of
racketeering, conspiracy and mail fraud for their operation of a
dump that allegedly stored infectious medical waste.
   Vulpis' nephew, Anthony Senter, was convicted recently of
racketeering and a civil rights conspiracy. During his 17-month
trial, witnesses said he disposed of two mob execution victims who
were chopped up and hauled in garbage trucks.
   The tipster identified Senter as the man who killed the victim
whose body parts were found at National-Stage, the newspaper said.
   ``The two cases have nothing to do with each other,'' said Ben
Brafman, the attorney for Vulpis and Senter. ``It is stretching the
truth to connect them.''
   Paccione is a major player in a mob carting cartel controlled by
the Gambino crime family, investigators told the Daily News.
   He has said he is a businessman with no organized crime
connections and that nothing improper happened at the dump.
   National-Stage has no license for collecting medical waste, a
state Health Department spokesman, Jerry Wolf, told the Daily News.

<TEXT>
   A judge will allow Philippine government
lawyers to question Imelda Marcos in connection with a $50 billion
civil racketeering lawsuit that also names her husband, former
Philippine leader Ferdinand Marcos.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer on Monday lifted a
two-year-old stay to allow lawyers to take a deposition from Mrs.
Marcos, although attorneys from both sides concede they are unlikely
to get many answers.
   The couple's attorney, John J. Bartko, said he would advise Mrs.
Marcos to invoke her right against self-incrimination. No date has
been set for the deposition.
   Marcos, who is gravely ill in a Honolulu hospital, is unable to
communicate with his attorneys or otherwise take part in the
proceedings, Bartko said.
   Attorneys representing the Philippines also amended their
complaint on Monday, adding charges that the Marcoses embezzled
money and property from the Philippine government and got kickbacks
from both foreign and domestic companies doing business in that
nation.
   Mrs. Marcos and her husband are accused of running their nation
as a personal enterprise, looting the country of billions of dollars.
   The couple left the Philippines in February 1986 as Marcos lost
control of the country amid allegations of voter fraud in his
election campaign against Corazon Aquino, who replaced him as
president.

   At least two bystanders failed to help two
toddlers found floating face down in an apartment swimming pool, and
a fire department official said he was baffled by their inaction.
   ``Anybody in their right mind _ you'd think they would, but they
didn't,'' said Capt. C.A. Beasley.
   Beasley said two men stood by while Taffidie McGough, 2, and her
15-month-old half-sister, Tiffidie Anne, were rescued from the pool.
   Tiffidie Anne was found floating face down in the shallow end of
the pool and was declared dead at the scene.
   Taffidie was on the bottom of the pool near her sister. She
didn't show a pulse but was revived en route to the hospital,
officials said. She remains in critical condition and on life
support systems at Texas Children's Hospital, spokeswoman Tina
Foster said.
   One man told Beasley there appeared to be ``dolls or dogs'' in
the pool.
   ``Regardless of what they thought they were,'' Beasley said. ``I
can't imagine anybody standing there looking at two kids in the
pool. They would be better off out of the pool no matter what.''
   District Attorney John B. Holmes said there are no criminal
sanctions for failing to rescue the children.
   ``But common sense suggests that no caring, thinking human being
would stand handily by while two kids were drowning,'' he said.
   The girls apparently left their apartment Sunday morning while
their mother slept and wandered into the pool.
   The girls' mother, Tammie Patterson, 20, said she learned her
children had fallen into the pool when an unidentified man knocked
on her door.
   ``I don't understand why they didn't'' try to save the children,
said Ms. Patterson.
   ``It's too late,'' she said. ``I've got one baby that's dead and
one baby who's fighting for her life.''

   The retired commander of a NATO intelligence
gathering post said he noticed a drop in material from East Bloc
sources in late 1985 and 1986, when two men accused of passing
secrets to East Germany were working at the base.
   Retired Col. Kenneth Roney's testimony Monday came on the opening
day of the federal trial of Huseyin Yildirim, 61, who is accused of
scheming with Army Warrant Officer James William Hall III to provide
military secrets to the Soviets and East Germans.
   Yildirim worked as a civilian mechanic at an Army auto shop in
West Berlin during Hall's time at the field station.
   Army intelligence experts said the operation funneled information
about the West's eavesdropping capabilities to East German and
Soviet agents for more than six years. They said the case appeared
to have inflicted serious damage to electronic spying efforts in
Europe.
   Roney, who was commander of the Berlin field station from 1984 to
1986, testified that toward the end of his command he noticed a
reduction in the amount of material coming to the Berlin listening
base from Eastern bloc sources.
   Roney also testified that Hall, Yildirim's alleged
co-conspirator, attracted his attention at Field Station Berlin in
1986 because he owned a $21,000 1985 Volvo 760 GLE auto. Roney said
he was hesitating about buying the same model on his colonel's
salary.
   The government is prosecuting Yildirim while trying to avoid
disclosing details about the intelligence operations he is accused
of harming. Two experts at the trial, representing the Defense
Department's national security interests, effectively were serving
as censors.
   During Roney's testimony, the experts objected to several defense
questions regarding the operation of Field Station Berlin.
   ``Did anyone under your command engage in counter-espionage
activities?'' asked defense attorney Lamar Walter. Roney was not
allowed to answer because the security advisers said the response
might include classified information.
   In opening arguments, assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Kramer said
the intelligence operation that the two men are accused of violating
was needed to overcome the Warsaw Pact's edge in conventional forces
in Europe.
   ``What is required to equalize the balance is information,''
Kramer said.
   Walter said his client ``did not participate in this conspiracy
to the extent he should be charged.''
   ``I know some of you read spy novels. You never know what the
conclusion is until you read the last chapter,'' Walter told the
jury, adding that Hall did most of the work.
   The trial is being held in Savannah since Hall was stationed at
nearby Fort Stewart at the time of his arrest. Kramer said Hall, who
was court-martialed in March, will be a government witness against
Yildirim. Hall, 30, was sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined
$50,000.
   Hall pleaded guilty to 10 counts of espionage, attempted
espionage and failing to obey Army regulations. He was dishonorably
discharged and forfeited all future Army pay and allowances. Hall
admitted to Army officials he received more than $100,000 between
1983 and 1988 to provide classified documents to Eastern bloc agents.
   Yildirim, identified in court documents as Meister Bie or Mike
Jones _ the man Hall identified as his conduit of classified
national defense documents to East Germans _ is charged with
conspiring with Hall to provide classified information from 1983 to
1988. Hall was named as a co-conspirator in Yildirim's indictment.
   Yildirim has been held in seclusion since his arrest at his
Belleair Beach, Fla., home in December.

<HEAD>Major Soviet Magazine Publishes Solzhenitsyn Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since he was exiled, a
mass-circulation magazine has published a work by Alexander I.
Solzhenitsyn _ a speech in which he urges other writers to throw off
the shackles of Communist censors.
   The 10-page speech was published Monday in Novy Mir, the nation's
leading literary journal. Solzhenitsyn wrote it after winning the
Nobel Prize for literature in 1970.
   Soviet officials barred him from traveling to Sweden to give the
lecture.
   Publication of the Nobel speech marked another important step
toward the rehabilitation of Solzhenitsyn, who was kicked out of the
Soviet Writers' Union in 1969 and exiled to the West five years
later.
   The chronicler of Stalinist terror was sent abroad after Western
publishers published his magnum opus ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' a
critique of Soviet rule since its birth in the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution.
   In his Nobel lecture, Solzhenitsyn condemned the persecution of
millions of Soviets, including writers. He urged his fellow authors
to describe reality as they saw it, not as dictated by Communist
authorities.
   ``The whole of our national literature lies buried, not only
without clothes, but also without underwear, naked, tagged on the
toe. But not for a minute was Russian literature interrupted,
although it was left aside.''
   Solzhenitsyn urged writers to take what he called ``a simple step
for a simple brave man: do not take part in lies, do not support
lying actions.''
   ``Defeat the lie!'' he wrote.
   ``Do not make excuses, do not give up the joys of life _ but
enter the struggle ... one word can pull the world together.''
   Novy Mir has a circulation of 1.5 million, and publication of the
speech gave Russian readers their first sanctioned taste of the
banned writer since the same journal published his novella, ``One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' 27 years ago.
   Novy Mir editor, Sergei Zalygin, said in introductory remarks
that the journal expects to publish the bulk of Solzhenitsyn's books.
   Excerpts from ``Gulag'' and two novels, ``The First Circle'' and
``Cancer Ward,'' will be published in subsequent issues, the note
said.
   Zalygin wrote that Novy Mir and other publications had received
many letters ``with demands to tell the truth about the unusual fate
of this writer, to print his work.''
   The Soviet government has moved toward rehabilitating
Solzhenitsyn, who is seen by some countrymen as a prophet of free
speech and by others as an avatar of Russian nationalism.
   The magazine Twentieth Century and Peace, a minor journal largely
distributed abroad, published in March a 2{-page essay written by
Solzhenitsyn. In early July, Looming, a literary journal in the
Baltic republic of Estonia, carried an excerpt from ``The Gulag
Archipelago.''
   The Soviet Writers' Union, which publishes Novy Mir, voted this
month to restore Solzhenitsyn's membership and urged the government
to reinstate his citizenship.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has promoted increased
openness as an important part of his reform program, hinted to
reporters that might happen.
   Solzhenitsyn, who lives with his family in seclusion in
Cavendish, Vt., has been invited to return to the Soviet Union for a
visit. Writers' Union sources have said they expect the visit as
early as this fall.

   A man charged in the murder of a church
volunteer was a small-time burglar, but no murderer, a defense
attorney said during the first day of John David Brown's murder
trial.
   Brown, 34, went on trial in Circuit Court Monday, more than two
years after a slaying that touched off an intensive two-month
manhunt.
   Brown's flight from the law inspired songs, T-shirts and other
local folklore, but the state regards him as a murderer and is
seeking the death penalty.
   In his opening remarks, Brown's court-appointed attorney, Brad
Kessler, portrayed Brown as someone who had a penchant for stealing
guns. But he said Brown was no murderer.
   However, Assistant Attorney General Tim Finnical said tests from
four ballistics experts showed that the .357-caliber Magnum revolver
Brown carried when he was arrested at a motel in Oklahoma was the
same gun used to kill Claude Long, 56.
   Long was shot and his car stolen shortly after he opened the New
Life Apostolic Church, near Doolittle in south-central Missouri, for
evening services on April 1, 1987.
   At the time, dozens of police officers were manning road blocks
and searching the surrounding Ozark hills for Brown, who was wanted
for wounding a Rolla police officer with a rifle two days earlier.
   Brown had been at large since escaping from the Ozark
Correctional Center near Springfield in June 1984. He was serving a
four-year term for burglary and possessing explosive weapons.
   Two hundred law officers from across the state, including
National Guardsmen, were involved in the two-month search for Brown.
   ``The evidence will be that this man deliberately took a life to
steal a car'' to avoid capture, Finnical said.
   Kessler said that the state was relying on circumstantial
evidence. No one saw Long killed, and police did not find Brown's
fingerprints in the church, he said.

   Bourguiba, 86, was ousted by Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali on Nov. 7,
1987 in a bloodless coup.
   Ben Ali, now president, said Bourguiba was removed because he had
become senile and physically incapable of performing the duties of
president.
   Until the ouster, Bourguiba was the only president Tunisia had
ever had since independence from France in 1956.

   Three black men were hanged

of Justice said.
   Spokeswoman Marie Pienaar said Joseph Lebeloane, Joseph Manyane
and Simon Selepe were executed in Pretoria prison. They had been
convicted of robbing and murdering their victim in July 1986 after
meeting him in a night club in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg.
   The rate of executions is down this year from 1988, when 117
people were hanged, and 1987, when 164 were executed.
   Those executed this year include 28 black men and two white men,
six men of mixed race and one mixed-race woman.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms continued over the nation's midsection this morning
after producing damaging winds, heavy rains and hail as big as
baseballs from Louisiana to the Dakotas.
   Winds gusted to 60 mph at Atlantic, Iowa, Foreman, Ark., Fremont,
Neb. and near Sioux Falls, S.D., late Monday. There were about two
dozen reports of wind damage in southern Arkansas, southeast
Oklahoma, the northern two thirds of Louisiana and west-central
Mississippi.
   In Nebraska, baseball-size hail fell at Wellfleet, and Farnam was
pelted with hail the size of golf balls and deluged with more than
1\ inches of rain in 15 minutes.
   Three-quarter inch hail fell at several locations in Kansas.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT included
2 inches at Sioux City, Iowa; 1{ inches at Omaha and 1.39 inches at
Norfolk, Neb.; and more than three quarters of an inch at Sioux
Falls, S.D.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued this morning from North
Dakota across central Kansas and from Minnesota into northern
Missouri.
   There were more showers and thunderstorms over the coast of
Virginia and North Carolina, and scattered over Florida and Georgia.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
upper Great Lakes and upper Mississippi Valley across the middle
Mississippi and lower Missouri valleys into Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Storms were likely to become severe from southeast Kansas into parts
of Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms were forecast from the eastern Carolinas to the
Florida Peninsula.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s over the upper Great Lakes
and upper Mississippi Valley, across northwest Washington State and
eastern Maine; between 100 and 110 degrees from the California
interior through much of Arizona and New Mexico into southwest and
central Texas; and between 110 and 115 degrees over the Desert
Southwest. Highs elsewhere generally were expected to be in the 80s
and 90s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 43 degrees at Yellowstone,
Wyo., to 96 degrees at Phoenix.

<HEAD>French Edition of Rushdie Novel Goes on Sale Wednesday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The French edition of ``The Satanic Verses'' goes on
sale in bookstores Wednesday, and its publisher said orders have
been brisk, despite the controversy and violence the book has
provoked in other countries.
   The novel, first published in English last year, is considered
blasphemous by many Moslems. Before he died last month, Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Moslems to kill the author,
Salman Rushdie.
   Two Iranian clerics supported the edict by offering a $5.2
million bounty.
   Demonstrations against the book by angry Moslems have occurred in
many cities around the world, including several in England. Rushdie,
an Indian-born writer now living in England, has been in hiding
under police protection.
   Of the 55 million people living in France, 2.5 million are Moslem.
   ``I am not publishing this book to reignite a religious war but
because a publisher must respect his obligations,'' Christian
Bourgois, head of Editions Christian Bourgois publishing company,
said in a radio interview today.
   ``I am publishing it under my name, and I have received the
public support of the minister of culture, Jack Lang, in the name of
the government ... to publish a book is not a provocation for a
publisher.''
   Publication of the French edition has been postponed several
times. Bourgois said the delay was in the translation and that he
only received the definitive French version in June.
   ``I don't feel in danger, but I can only take seriously the
demonstrations that occurred in the Middle East, in Pakistan or in
London,'' Bourgois said. He said he and his family had been taking
special security measures since winter.
   ``This is the integral version of the book,'' Bourgois said.
``There was never any question of publishing a modified or truncated
version. I have always intended to publish this book in its integral
version, that is, 585 pages.''
   The publisher would not say exactly how large the printing of the
French first edition was. ``It's a big printing,'' he said.
   ``Tens of thousands of copies have been ordered. Most of the big
department stores have ordered copies as well.''
   The book is considered blasphemous by many Moslems because it
includes a scene in which prostitutes take the names of the wives of
the Prophet Mohammed and because it suggests that Mohammed wrote the
Koran himself rather than receiving it from God.

   From cornfields and the backs of pickup
trucks, hundreds of people waved at Amtrak's Montrealer passenger
train as it snaked through northwestern New England for the first
time in more than two years.
   The Washington-to-Montreal train resumes end-to-end service for
the public beginning today, following Monday's special train that
left Amherst, Mass., and ended in Montreal.
   The Montrealer has been a fixture in New England since 1972, but
the train stopped running north of Springfield, Mass., in April
1987. Amtrak said 49 miles of track had deteriorated so badly that
the train could only inch along at 5 mph in spots.
   The former owner, Guilford Transportation Industries, and Amtrak
couldn't agree on payments for repairs, and Amtrak finally asked the
Interstate Commerce Commission to condemn the line. The ICC agreed,
and another railway bought the line and fixed it with a
congressional appropriation.
   Money has also been set aside to fix another 50-mile stretch in
Massachusetts. In the meantime, the train is running on an alternate
route in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
   About 400 politicians, rail buffs and train executives were
aboard Monday's train.
   A fife and drum corps greeted them in Claremont, N.H., where
passenger rail service returned for the first time in 23 years.
   ``My wife and I are going to go to Montreal on this train in a
couple of weeks,'' said Tom Burnham, one of 300 to welcome the train
in Claremont. ``This is great for the area. It's the only stop in
New Hampshire, but I think it's excellent _ an opportunity we can't
afford to miss.''
   The politicians took turns engineering the train, with Vermont
Gov. Madeleine Kunin in the driver's seat as the train pulled into
Montpelier.
   ``We look at passenger train service as a nostalgic look into the
past. But I really think it's a look into the future,'' she said.
``If you're worried about the ozone layer up there, here's one
alternative.''
   Mike Brazinski, an assistant conductor from Waterford, N.Y., saw
another reason to make the trip.
   ``It's a beautiful way to go,'' he said.

   Ronald Lauder has spent $8.5 million so far in
his quest to become mayor, more than any mayoral candidate in New
York history, according to a report.
   All the mayoral candidates filed campaign finance reports
Tuesday, and Lauder's dwarfed that of five other strong candidates.
   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, Lauder's opponent in the
Republican primary, has raised between $1.2 million and $1.4 million.
   Ninety-three percent _ $7.9 million _ of Lauder's campaign money
came out of his pocket, according to The New York Times in today's
editions.
   Lauder, an heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune, had an
income last year of $30 million and reported his net worth at $227
million.
   The Republican primary turnout is expected to be about 100,000,
campaign aides told the Times, so Lauder has already spent about $85
on each potential voter.
   The bulk of Lauder's spending has gone for television ads _ $5
million worth.
   The finance reports indicate that all the candidates except
Lauder are having trouble raising money, and as a result, public
matching funds for their campaigns is likely to be lower than
anticipated.
   Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins has raised nearly $1.9
million.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch also has $1.9 million to spend.
   City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin has between $1.4 and $1.7
million.
   And former Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman Richard
Ravitch has raised $1.2 million.

<HEAD>State Budget Crisis: The Best of Times Led to the Worst of Times</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Absentee leadership, bad economic forecasting and
tax-cut fever all may have contributed to Massachusetts' current
budget crisis, but there's no simple explanation for how the best of
times turned into the worst.
   People still find it difficult to understand how a state
overflowing in money, with a presidential nominee for a governor,
wound up in a financial hole.
   ``This state had six of the most extraordinary years in our
history,'' Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Monday. ``Maybe we began to
believe it would never change.''
   In 1986, as Dukakis told everyone who would listen, Massachusetts
was a miracle state, able to pay for new, innovative programs and
cut taxes at the same time. The major domestic debate that year was
over what to do with a $348 million budget surlus fueled by a
booming state economy.
   Three years later Dukakis suffered what he called the most bitter
day of his political career _ this coming from a man who lost 40
states in the presidential election. Dukakis last Thursday, unable
to convince voters to support a tax increase, cut nearly a half
billion dollars from the state budget.
   The $491 million in budget cuts included a $210 million reduction
in state aid to cities and towns for such things as schools and
police, a $97 million cut in human services and $62 million from
education.
   The explanation Dukakis gives for the state fiscal situation is
that revenue taken in by tax collectors plummeted over the past two
years and the state has been been taking up the slack left by Reagan
administration budget cuts.
   Both are true. Revenue experts can talk for hours about how
changes in the federal tax code, the stock market crash of October
1987 and this year's sales tax decline made a mockery of their
revenue estimates _ the numbers on which state spending is planned.
   But critics who hold a more conservative fiscal viewpoint than
Dukakis say the governor and the Legislature over the past six years
simply allowed state spending to rise out of control.
   James Howell, chief economist of the Bank of Boston, dismissed
the notion that faulty revenue forecasts led Massachusetts into its
current crisis. ``The right question is: if they had been given the
right information all along, would they have had the courage to make
the right decisions?''
   Partisan critics have blamed the 18-month Dukakis presidential
campaign for leaving the state without a leader as the financial
crisis developed. Others see roots much deeper.
   From 1984 through 1989, state spending increased 67.3 percent, or
nearly three times the rate of inflation, according to the
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. Personal income during the same
period has gone up 51 percent.
   Figuring precisely what the Massachusetts public wants has not
always been easy. In one recent newspaper poll, for example, 64
percent of those responding opposed an emergency tax increase passed
by the Legislature to make up for last year's budget deficit. In the
same poll, 65 percent said they were opposed to Dukakis' budget
spending cuts for this fiscal year.
   Some argue that the fiscal conservatives _ those most critical of
Dukakis and state spending _ are partially to blame for the current
crisis.
   In 1986, when state revenue was pouring in, Dukakis, under heavy
pressure from the Legislature and public opinion, repealed a surtax
he had imposed in his first term. The move cut state revenue by $280
million. Other tax cuts which Dukakis eventually supported trimmed
revenue by some $400 million during the past six years. Ironically,
those cuts just about equal the shortfall the state is facing.

<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers at the racketeering trial of E.
Robert Wallach have called one former U.S. attorney general as a
witness, but they will not get a chance to question the man
currently holding the post.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen on Monday threw out a subpoena
to call Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to the stand.
   Wallach's attorney, Gary Naftalis, said he wanted to question
Thornburgh about an internal Justice Department report that faulted
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, a defense witness.
   The report, which was issued in January, said Meese had violated
codes of ethics in his efforts to help Wallach in an ill-fated,
Mideast oil pipeline proposal and to assist him with the Wedtech
Corp.
   Wedtech, once a small machine shop in the South Bronx, grew into
a $100 million government contractor through a special Small
Business Administration program that set aside contracts without
competitive bidding for minority-controlled companies.
   Evidence at earlier trials has shown that Wedtech continued to
receive the no-bid contracts through a series of bribe schemes even
after it ceased to be a minority-owned company.
   Wallach, a San Francisco attorney who is a longtime friend of
Meese, is charged with two others in a 21-count racketeering
indictment with extracting almost $2 million in illegal payoffs and
payments from Wedtech, including $525,000 in alleged bribes to
Wallach to influence Meese and other government officials.
   Meese was asked about the report when he was cross-examined by
Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss last Thursday.
   Weiss submitted into evidence a press release that stated
Thornburgh had accepted the report after Meese testified that
Thornburgh had not adopted the report's findings.
   Naftalis argued that Weiss had incorrectly stated that Thornburgh
had ``adopted'' the findings of the department's Office of
Professional Conduct.
   According to Naftalis, Thornburgh had in fact distanced himself
from the report and had delayed its release so Meese and his lawyers
could prepare a rebuttal, made public on the same day.
   Naftalis said Weiss tried to make it look like Meese had lied to
the jury and that he needed to question Thornburgh to set the record
straight.
   Weiss opposed the subpoena and said Thornburgh's testimony would
be irrelevant.
   The other defendants are W. Franklyn Chinn, 47, a former Wedtech
board member and onetime Meese financial adviser, and a business
associate of theirs, R. Kent London.

   A wooden replica of a Civil War-era sailing
vessel sank in the North Atlantic after its seven-member crew was
rescued from a massive ice pack shrouded in fog, the ship's builder
says.
   A Danish shrimp boat responded to the Sheila Yeates' mayday call
on Friday and plowed through ice and fog to save the crew, said
Geoffrey Pope, 76, who built and skippered the ship.
   The trawler towed the ship 430 miles from the spot off the coast
of Greenland where it was trapped, but the boat took on water and
finally was cut loose and sank Monday, he said.
   The Sheila Yeates, a topsail ketch with a 50-foot deck, was one
of the tall ships that commemorated the U.S. Bicentennial. The ship
left Duluth on May 15 bound for Cornwall, England.
   Pope's account was delivered from aboard the trawler to friends
in the Minneapolis area just moments after the ship went down.
   ``I feel very responsible,'' Pope said. ``I lost the ship. But
aside from that, I feel such a reaffirmation of the potential ... of
the bond that exists between men in extremus.''
   Pope said the voyage went smoothly until Thursday, when the ship
approached a point about 80 miles south of Greenland's Point Farwell
and encountered ice farther south than expected.
   In an apparent misunderstanding over ice conditions, the Sheila
Yeates found itself in thick fog surrounded by massive chunks of ice
with no room to maneuver. The shifting ice would have crushed the
wooden ship to bits, Pope said.
   The trawler Kiviuq, which fishes in the Arctic and is equipped
with ice-breaking equipment, responded to the tall ship's mayday. By
radio, the skippers of the two vessels traded navigational
coordinates until the Kiviuq broke through the ice pack and found
the Sheila Yeates.

   A Tamil leader with close links to
India was shot and killed by unidentified assailants in Colombo,
police said today.
   Uma Maheswaran, 44, was killed on Sunday, said a police official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The leader's body, which had a
gunshot wound in the head, was identified late Monday, the official
said.
   Last week, two other Tamil leaders, also considered pro-India,
were shot and killed in their Colombo residence. Witnesses
identified the assailants as members of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, a rebel group fighting the 40,000 Indian soldiers
deployed in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   The Tigers denied the charge.
   In Madras, India, a spokesman for Sri Lankan Tamils said
Maheswaran had been attacked by Tiger assailants at least three
times in the past. The spokesman, Ponnudurai Ravinesan, said
Maheswaran was targeted because he broke away from the Tigers in
1975 to form his own militia.
   Maheswaran headed the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil
Eelam, a former rebel group that accepted an Indian-sponsored accord
in 1987 aimed at ending the insurgency by members of Sri Lanka's
Tamil minority who seek greater autonomy.
   The Tigers rejected the agreement and turned their guns on the
Indians. Since May, the Tigers have been holding talks with the Sri
Lankan government and both sides have called for Indian soldiers to
pull out by the end of July.
   India has refused, saying a hasty withdrawal will enable the
Tigers to attack rival Tamil groups and escalate violence on the
island nation.
   The issue has soured relations between the Colombo and New Delhi,
and both sides have exchanged sharply-worded letters on the subject.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Tigers said 16 members of the
group left Colombo on Monday after concluding a round of talks with
the government. The talks started in May, the fist direct contact
between the two sides since the insurgency began in 1983.
   Both sides say they are satisfied with the progress in the
negotiations. Another round of talks will be held soon, the Tiger
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At least 9,000 people have been killed in the Tamil insurgency,
which was launched by at least a half-dozen guerrilla groups. The
victims have included many Tamils caught up in internecine fighting.
   India became involved in Sri Lanka's problems because of the
sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
allege they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up
75 percent of the population.

   A religious group's call for a one-year boycott of
products made by Mennen Co. and Clorox Corp. for advertising on
television shows full of ``sex, violence and profanity'' was
denounced by some advertising and TV executives.
   Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, or CLeaR-TV,
announced Monday that it singled out Clorox and Mennen for placing
ads on offensive television programs from April 27 through May 24, a
``sweeps'' period during which the popularity of network programming
was gauged.
   ``We hope that concerned Americans will join us in this boycott
and in our efforts to preserve the quality of life we enjoy in this
country,'' said Billy Melvin, chairman of the suburban Wheaton-based
group.
   But advertising executive George Lois said calls for such
boycotts were threats to the independence and creativity of his
industry.
   ``We're in a hell of a shape if people succumb to those kind of
tactics,'' said Lois, chairman of Lois-GGK in New York.
   Sue Binford, a spokeswoman for NBC, said CLeaR-TV is ignoring
America's traditions of free choice and free speech in attempting to
define for others what is acceptable programming.
   ``We're confident that viewers who believe in their own right to
choose what to watch on television will support the advertisers that
have been unfairly singled out and will recognize this one-sided,
misguided tactic for what it is,'' Ms. Binford said.
   Programs the group found particularly offensive during that
period included ``Miami Vice,'' ``Tour of Duty'' and ``Midnight
Caller,'' Melvin said.
   CLeaR-TV describes itself as a coalition of 1,600 Christian
leaders with constituencies totaling 60 million people. Its founder,
the Rev. Donald Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss., is a vocal critic of
``anti-Christian'' television.
   In a written statement, the Mennen Co. said it should not act as
a censor for CLeaR-TV or any other group objecting to programs
sponored by the manufacturer of toiletries. The company said it
pre-screens shows and doesn't advertise on shows that don't meet its
standards.
   Clorox said in a statement that the company ``for years has had
very stringent standards for the shows it buys time on.'' It said
the shows were pre-screened by its advertising agencies and ``there
is no indication they did not meet our standards.''

   Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski
is taking a big and politically perilous step in streamlining the
network of veterans' hospitals and clinics, but he's counting on a
commission to help take the heat.
   Even so, the recent shock of military base closings recommended
by a Pentagon commission might make the maneuver more difficult for
Derwinski.
   ``It would be hard to take a hospital closures bill where we just
got through with base closures,'' Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery,
D-Miss., said Monday after Derwinski announced his proposal.
   VA facilities, like military bases, are pet projects among
members of Congress, largely because of the jobs they provide.
   Montgomery, head of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, said
he would co-sponsor the bill out of courtesy to Derwinski but will
give it only one hearing and put off further action until next year.
   On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska,
said he will help sponsor Derwinski's bill but has also introduced
his own, which specifically makes closings a possibility. Derwinski
only talks about ``changing missions'' and ``realignments.''
   ``It's no secret that when VA desires to modify the size or
mission of VA facilities its efforts are met with a great deal of
resistance from members of Congress who represent those districts or
states,'' said Murkowski, the ranking GOP member of the Senate
Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   ``A mechanism to remove political considerations from discussions
of mission changes and consolidations is desperately needed,'' he
said.
   His and Derwinski's bills would be all or nothing, giving
congressmen virtually no chance of reversing decisions to close the
facilities once the process has started.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. and chairman of the Senate Veterans'
Affairs Committee, said only, ``I will work with the administration
to develop acceptable legislation.''
   As a result of the military base-closing panel, 86 installations
and housing complexes were ordered closed, and 54 received new
missions. Montgomery said some similar decisions could be made about
hospitals, with some changing to outpatient facilities, for example.
   Murkowski noted no VA hospital has been closed since the Johnson
administration, when six were closed.
   If established by Congress, the commission would examine all 172
Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers plus hundreds of
clinics and treatment units. The nine to 15 members, chosen by the
VA secretary, would make an all-or-nothing proposal to the VA by
Jan. 1, 1991.
   The VA secretary would send the proposal to Congress. If the plan
is approved, the recommendations would have to be implemented by
Jan. 1, 1997.
   The members would be chosen from the fields of clinical care,
academic medicine, research and veterans' interests.
   ``We have an aging veteran population that is also shifting
geographically, and we have pressures on the VA system that must be
addressed,'' Derwinski said. ``This legislation provides the impetus
for getting many of our problems solved quickly rather than trying
to make piecemeal changes.''
   Said Murkowski: ``The practice of medicine is constantly changing
due to advance in medical technology and sometimes as a result of
efforts to control the cost of health care. The delivery of care has
shifted from a system which relied on inpatient hospitalization to
increases in outpatient care.''
   The number of veterans over 65 is increasing, meaning a greater
need in nursing home care and care for the diseases of old age.
   Also, veterans as they age are moving to Sun Belt states, where
there are fewer facilities, according to the VA.

   A new paperback edition of ``Fatal Vision,''
about a physician convicted of murdering his family, includes author
Joe McGinniss' response to charges that he misled his subject, The
New York Times said today.
   Signet New American Library is to begin shipping 100,000 new
copies of the book Wednesday.
   ``Fatal Vision'' tells about Jeffrey MacDonald, a physician and
former Green Beret convicted in 1979 of the murders of his wife and
two young daughters.
   McGinniss befriended MacDonald, even after he was convinced the
doctor was guilty.
   In an article in The New Yorker magazine earlier this year,
writer Janet Malcolm argued that McGinniss deceived MacDonald by
continuing their friendship. She went on to suggest in
``Reflections: The Journalist and the Murderer'' that all
journalists deceive their subjects somewhat.
   In an epilogue to the new edition of the nonfiction book,
McGinniss wrote that ``There was no commitment, indication or even
hint that my book would portray MacDonald as innocent.''
   He said that he did not hide his doubts about MacDonald's
innocence and never intended to deceive him.
   ``I liked MacDonald when I was with him during his murder trial.
I felt sorry for him for months afterward and wrote him letters
genuinely expressing that sorrow, even after I'd formed my opinion
as to his guilt,'' McGinniss said.
   The book was published by G.P. Putnam in 1983 and put out in
paperback by Signet the next year. It also was made into a
television miniseries.

   A golfer who shot a hole-in-one to win a
car will get to keep it even though he made the shot two days after
the car contest ended.
   A car dealer had refused to deliver the 1988 Chevrolet Beretta GT
that Amos Cobaugh claimed after hitting the shot on the ninth hole
of the Fairview Golf Course in southeastern Pennsylvania in May 1987.
   The car was intended as a prize for a charity golf tournament two
days before Cobaugh played. The car and signs announcing the prize
for a hole-in-one were still on the tee when Cobaugh dropped the
ball into the cup with one shot during another tournament.
   In a 2-1 decision released Monday, the Pennsylvania Superior
Court said Cobaugh is entitled to keep the car offered by
Klick-Lewis Inc. of Palmyra.
   Contract law dictates that if a person performs as stated in a
contest and wins, it's an enforceable contract, the court said.
   ``A person reading the signs would reasonably understand that he
or she could accept the offer and win the car by performing the feat
of shooting a hole-in-one,'' said Judge Donald E. Wieand.
   ``I feel great,'' said Cobaugh, 56, an electrician for Hershey
Foods. It was his only hole-in-one in 21 years of playing golf. He
plays about twice a week.
   The dealer's attorney, Robert M. Frankhouser Jr. of Lancaster,
said the dealer fears the ruling will discourage other car dealers
from donating vehicles for charitable purposes.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Zoran Popovich said the contract
couldn't be enforced because giving a car for a hole-in-one amounts
to illegal gambling.
   Quoting statistics from Golf Digest magazine, Popovich said an
average golfer playing a par-3 hole of average difficulty has a
1-in-20,000 chance of ``acing the hole.'' A professional has a
1-in-10,000 chance, the judge said.

<HEAD>Texas Goat Trader Gets 18-Month Prison Term in Horse Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas goat trader was sentenced to 18 months
in federal prison for his role in a failed scheme to collect
insurance money on eight horses that were killed in a staged
accident.
   Rocky Beene, the last of four defendants sentenced in the case,
received the longest prison term for trying to defraud an insurance
company of $83,000 through phony claims involving the horses. He was
sentenced Monday in U.S. District Court.
   The animals, six of which were old and had little resale value,
were put inside a horse trailer and driven off a cliff in May 1983
near rural Jacumba in eastern San Diego County.
   The insurance company never paid the claim, but its investigation
and a subsequent lawsuit prompted authorities to file criminal
charges last year against Beene and five others.
   U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving allowed Beene, 48, of
Junction, Texas, to begin serving his 18-month term Sept. 15. Beene
requested the delay so he can help finish blood testing on his goats
under an experimental AIDS research program.
   His attorney, Ronald Waska, in Houston, asked the judge to place
Beene on probation, arguing that his client didn't profit from the
scheme.
   However, Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Hayes said Beene admitted
he stood to receive $2,500 of the insurance proceeds if the company
had paid on the claims.
   The owner of the horses, Raymond Paul, 53, of Keyes, Calif.,
surrendered to authorities Monday to begin serving the one-year
prison term he received last month.

   The B-2 stealth bomber is a
revolutionary advancement in intercontinental bombers that was in
development for 18 years, Air Force officials say.
   The B-2 was designed to evade detection by sophisticated enemy
air defenses with an unorthodox design of curves and contours.
   The stealth technology does not elude enemy radar so much as
absorb it, reflecting little radar energy back to ground receivers.
   ``We're talking about an aircraft now that basically negates the
air defenses built up in many many places around the world over many
years,'' said Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, who directs research,
development and testing of aerospace systems for the Air Force.
   The flying wing design was first conceived in the 1940s by
Northrop Corp. founder Jack Northrop, although the YB-49 aircraft he
built was scrapped by the government in 1948 in favor of more
conventional bomber designs.
   A factor leading to the demise of the YB-49 was a crash that
killed air force test pilot Glen Edwards. The Mojave Desert air
force base that now bears his name has become a focus of advanced
flight test research.
   The history of the flying wing came full circle Monday, as the
B-2 successfully completed its maiden flight and landed smoothly at
Edwards.
   The bomber is about 17 feet high and 69 feet long, only slightly
longer than an F-15 fighter.
   The wingspan, however, is about 172 feet, almost the span of a
B-52 bomber.
   It is powered by four General Electric engines mounted on top of
the wing. The Air Force says the engines were derived from those
used in F-16 and F-14 fighters.
   The bomber flies at subsonic speeds and is capable of hugging the
terrain closely or flying as high as 50,000 feet, the Air Force said.
   The B-2 has an operational range of more than 6,000 nautical
miles at high altitudes and more than 10,000 nautical miles with
aerial refueling capability.
   The aircraft will carry both nuclear and conventional weapons,
the Air Force said.
   The two-hour test flight was conducted with the landing gear
extended during the entire flight.
   Northrop test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, 50, and copilot Air Force
Col. Richard S. Couch, 42, said they flew the bomber at three speeds
and guided it through numerous turns to test its stability.
   Couch described the B-2 as ``a very nimble aircraft'' and said
the landing approach was ``rock'' steady.

   Authorities today threatened people who
join a major anti-government rally with death sentences in a
crackdown a day after monks reportedly clashed with security forces
at a Buddhist shrine.
   Ten people were arrested in the confrontation Monday at the
capital's Shwedagon Pagoda, the country's most famous shrine,
official Rangoon Radio reported.
   Opposition groups have said they will mount a mass pro-democracy
rally Wednesday during the annual Martyrs Day, which commemorates
the 1947 assassination of seven leaders to helped Burma achieve
independence from Britain. Burma became independent in 1948.
   Today, trucks equipped with loudspeakers moved through Rangoon
warning people to stay away from Wednesday's protests, diplomats
said. Public gatherings of more than five people are illegal under
martial law.
   ``There are trucks going round with loudspeakers telling people
that if there is any trouble on Martyrs Day, if there are any
demonstrations, people must not go out and join in,'' said a Western
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``It looks as if they are trying to head off a big showdown,'' he
said.
   The martial law decrees have been in force since September, when
military commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power. Thousands of people
were killed in last year's crackdown of a popular nationwide
movement demanding an end to a quarter century of military rule.
   Radio Rangoon announced today that all cases of defiance of
government orders would be tried exclusively by military tribunals.
People found guilty will receive at least three years imprisonment
or a maximum penalty of death, the radio said.
   Rangoon residents and Western diplomats have predicted a showdown
between the ruling military council and the most popular opposition
party, the National League for Democracy, on Wednesday.
   The National League, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi, has announced
that it will not participate in the government plans for Martyrs Day
and will instead lead 104 opposition parties in a rival march to the
Martyrs Mausoleum in Rangoon.
   Ms. Suu Kyi is the daughter of Aung San, a national hero and one
of the seven independence leaders slain in 1947.
   Political dissent has swelled in Burma in the past month with Ms.
Suu Kyi denouncing military rule before large crowds in Rangoon.
Strong warnings have come from the government to end political
confrontation.
   On Monday, military authorities announced that three members of
Ms. Suu Kyi's party had been arrested in connection with a bomb
attack at a government oil refinery. Three people were killed and
two were wounded in the July 7 attack, they said.
   Monday's clash at the shrine occurred during the Waso festival,
one of the most holy in the Buddhist calendar. Waso marks Buddha's
first sermon to his followers after attaining enlightenment.
   Rangoon Radio said monks and pilgrims began chanting protests
after about 100 monks were refused entry to the pagoda because they
were not carrying identity cards.
   Monks began ``protesting loudly'' when the gates of the eastern
part of the pagoda were locked, the radio said.
   ``As the chants were going on, lay people ... arrived and joined
in the chants,'' the radio reported. ``Security forces appealed for
calm ... (but) as the appeal went unheeded, (they) chased the people
and the crowd dispersed.''
   Ten people were detained for ``further legal action'' the radio
said.
   The Shwedagon pagoda has been the site of numerous political
protests in Burmese history. During last year's upheaval,
pro-democracy demonstrators used it for a time as a headquarters for
their movement.

   A mild earthquake jolted Hollister and
nearby Northern California communities early today but there were no
reports of damage.
   The earthquake measured 3.6 on the Richter scale of ground motion
and was centered 5 miles northeast of Hollister on the Quien Sabe
fault, said Lu Page, spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Service in
Menlo Park.
   ``We had a few calls and felt it right here in police
headquarters,'' said a Hollister police dispatcher who declined to
give her name. ``It was a pretty good shake.''
   The earthquake, which struck at 4:07 a.m., was felt in Salinas 25
miles away.
   ``I was in a water bed and felt it so it had to be a pretty good
one,'' said Tom Lee, city editor with the Salinas Californian.
   Hollister is 120 miles south of San Francisco.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means a tenfold increase in magnitude. A quake of 3.5 can cause
slight damage in populated areas; a 6.0 quake can cause severe
damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

<HEAD>Abkhazia Explodes in Civil Strife, Thousands Involved in Shootings</HEAD>

   Thousands of Georgians and Abkhazians have been
shooting at each other, taking hostages and halting traffic for
three days along a resort strip on the Black Sea, officials said
today. At least 16 people were reported killed.
   Ethnic rioters in numerous cities in western Georgia, including
the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic, broke into prisons and police
stations, stole firearms and shot up official buildings, according
to several accounts.
   The official news agency Tass said 16 people have died. Gizo
Grzeledze of the Georgian Foreign Ministry said that as of Monday,
137 were hospitalized, including 15 in serious condition.
   Tass said there were no new clashes Monday but a highly placed
official in Sukhumi, capital of Abkhazia, described the autonomous
republic as remaining under virtual attack.
   On the border between Abkhazia and western Georgia, ``masses of
people are moving against the Interior Ministry troops,'' said the
official, who refused to be further identified. ``They are armed,
with shotguns and automatic weapons.''
   ``In effect, they are spreading terror,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Thousands of Soviet tourists in the resort area were reported
trying to escape the ethnic violence, but transport was interrupted
in the area 870 miles south of Moscow.
   ``There is no food. Seaside vacationers are desperate for means
to leave the city,'' said the Sukhumi official.
   Many Abkhazians are seeking their own republic, which would be
the 16th in the Soviet Union. The Georgian Republic now administers
the region of 3,320 square miles in the Caucasus mountains near
Turkey. Out of Abkhazia's population of 535,000, 94,000 are
Abkhazian.
   The fighting started Saturday in Sukhumi, where both the minority
Abkhazian and majority Georgians claim discrimination.
   The Georgian newspaper Zarya Vostoka reported that on Sunday
night, 5,000 people were armed in the Sukhumi area, and gunfire was
exchanged. Violence was reported in Ochamchira, Tkvarcheli,
Gulripsh, Gali, and Gudauta in Abkhazia and in Zugdide in western
Georgia. The official news agency Tass said officials have
confiscated more than 300 firearms.
   One battle along the Gumista River near Sukhumi involved at least
400 Abkhazians and Georgians, said Grzeledze, who read the Zarya
Vostoka report over the telephone.
   ``Large groups of armed people moved in the direction of
Ochamchira,'' but were stopped on the Galidze River by Interior
Ministry troops, he quoted the newspaper as saying.
   The official in Sukhumi said of the Galidze River confrontation
that ``Abkhazians stood alone on the river for 10 hours, defending
the border against Georgians until the arrival of Interior Ministry
troops.''
   On Monday night, ``a group of 300 to 500 Georgians crossed the
river and attacked the village of Merkula,'' he said. Two people
were wounded, one critically, he said. The official said the
attackers took two hostages, but that police later managed to free
them.
   Mobs ripped up train tracks and halted road and rail traffic into
the area, according to Zarya Vostoka. The Sukhumi official said
women and children were evacuated by boat from the city.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin said Monday that 3,000 police and
troops had been deployed to keep order. The Sukhumi official said
there were 3,500 troops alone in the area of Ochamchira, on the
coast south of Sukhumi.
   He said 90 percent of businesses were not operating. Tass put the
figure at more than 50 percent in certain cities and said
demonstrations continued.
   Three top Georgian leaders in Sukhumi trying to stabilize the
situation, Grzeledze said.
   The Sukhumi official said the clashes began when 5,000 to 8,000
people of various nationalities demonstrated on Lenin Square in
Sukhumi on Saturday afternoon to protest the splitting of the local
university into Abkhazian and Georgian sections. He said 1,000
Georgians attacked peaceful demonstrators.
   The Georgian Foreign Ministry said earlier the violence started
when Abkhazians attacked Georgians at a university branch where
classes will be in Georgian.
   In April, ethnic conflicts in Abkhazia set off demonstrations in
Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, that turned into demands for Georgian
independence from the Soviet Union. The protests were crushed by
troops, and at least 20 people died in the unrest.

<HEAD>Newborn Baby Found Alive Four Days After Being Abandoned In Woods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBERTY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newborn baby boy who survived almost five
days in a cardboard box in the woods was suffering from frostbite,
swelling and respiratory problems, but is a ``real fighter,''
authorities said today.
   The infant, known as Baby John Doe, was in stable but critical
condition when he was transferred from the Community General
Hospital in Harris to the Westchester County Medical Center.
   ``It is a miracle. We never expected to find the baby alive,''
said Liberty Police Chief Edward Eisley. ``Temperatures were
extemely cool here and we had a period of rain that the baby was
exposed to.''
   The infant's mother, a 17-year-old who concealed her pregnancy
from her family, was arraigned Monday night on charges of
first-degree assault and first-degree reckless endangerment, both
felonies.
   Police refused to release the name of the girl, who was granted
youthful offender status by Village Justice David Schiff and sent
without bail to the Sullivan County Jail in Monticello.
   The teen-ager told police she abandoned her son because she
thought he was dead when born about 6 a.m. last Thursday, Eisley
said.
   The girl delivered the baby herself at her parents' home and may
have thought the baby stopped breathing and died after birth, Eisley
said. Her parents learned that she had been pregnant when police
called to question them.
   The girl was distraught but ``happy to hear the baby was alive,''
he said.
   The baby, which weighed 6 pounds, 3 ounces, was wrapped in a bed
sheet, placed in the box and left in the woods behind an apartment
complex in Liberty, located about 70 miles northwest of New York
City.
   Temperatures dipped into the 50s during the five days that the
boy went without food, Eisley said.
   Police found the boy Monday after receiving several tips that the
teen-ager had abandoned her baby. He will be turned over to county
social workers when he recovers, Eisley said.
   ``It looks like he might be a real fighter,'' said a nursing
supervisor at Community General who requested anonymity. ``I'd say
he's in rather good condition, considering. I'm surprised he's
alive.''

<DATELINE>MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crews battling a stubborn
wildfire reinforced their air power today and continued to struggle
to cut a containment line through steep terrain.
   The fire, which flared up over the weekend after experts thought
it was defeated, has burned 3,000 acres of pinyon trees and juniper
brush, but has spared Anasazi Indian cliff dwellings in the park in
the southwestern corner of the state.
   Firefighters planned to double their capacity to dump
fire-retardant slurry on the flames by setting up a depot in the
park to load the chemical mix into three helicopters working the
blaze. They previously had to shuttle to Durango or Grand Junction,
20 and 120 miles distant, respectively.
   The staff on the fire lines was tripled Monday, to 260, said fire
information officer John Pasquantino, and fire bosses were hoping to
contain the blaze Wednesday.
   Officials estimated the blaze was 85 percent contained and there
were about 3{ miles of fire line left to build. The remaining 15
percent, however, was on extremely steep terrain, Pasquantino said,
and containment wasn't expected until Wednesday afternoon.
   Elsewhere in the West:
   _The U.S. Bureau of Land Management launched a renewed attack
against a week-old lightning-caused blaze in pinon, juniper and sage
that was estimated at 1,000 acres outside Rangely in northwestern
Colorado. BLM spokesman Mike Rieser said the blaze approached a
ranch and a cow camp, but firefighters moved engines in and prepared
to back-burn an area to protect them.
   _Decreasing winds helped turn a wildfire away from summer homes
and a fish hatchery in southwestern Utah, but officials doubled
their manpower in case the 6,500-acre blaze explodes today. Forest
Service officials added 10 more pumpers and 400 fresh firefighters
to the lines Monday night in anticipation the blaze, burning in the
Dixie National Forest east of Cedar City, would grow to 8,000 acres.
   The fire is one of five uncontained blazes in southern Utah.

<HEAD>Hand-Crank Phone Network to Lose Link to Outside World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH FORK, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Progress is about to claim another
victim _ the Depression-era ring-down telephone system that has been
serving 18 homes in the canyon of Idaho's Salmon River.
   On Dec. 15, the operator keeping the customers of the North Fork
Telephone Co. in touch with the outside world will be replaced by an
AT&amp;T computer.
   The new equipment will no longer make the link between the
world's communications system and the crank-operated canyon
telephones that run on batteries and magnetos. Residents will be
able to talk to each other but won't be able to connect with the
outside world.
   The system is the last of its kind in Idaho and one of the last
in the United States.
   ``It hit us so unexpectedly. We've always been assured we would
have this service,'' said Marsha Smith, who with her neighbors is
accustomed to living without electricity and only seasonal running
water in the central Idaho canyon cut by the wilderness river.
   Century Telephone Co., which has been providing the operator,
offered to help solve the problem, but since it is becoming simply
the local exchange, company manager Frank Barsalou said there was
little his company could do.
   The system's users are linked to the world beyond by a single
wire connected to insulators hanging from rocks, poles and trees.
Calls to and from the outside must go through a local operator, who
buzzes the proper phone with a coded ring.
   The system originally served the U.S. Forest Service, and it was
bought by the resident cooperative in 1952 when the government
switched to radio communications.
   The canyon is too curvy for antenna radios to work, and while
residents of the 18 homes strung along a 31-mile stretch of the
canyon could hire their own operator, it would cost more than $1,600
a week.
   Because the Salmon is a wilderness river in that area west of
North Fork, the Forest Service refuses to allow new above-ground
telephone lines, and burying the phone cable could cost $600,000.
   Neither is economical, and canyon residents don't want to change
anyway.
   ``We would much rather have this for a wilderness area,'' North
Fork Vice President John Booker said.
   Idaho Public Utilities Commissioner Perry Swisher said he
believes phone service can be saved if everyone cooperates until a
technological answer can be found.
   But, Swisher said, ``What's bothered me, personally, is that I
haven't seen much imagination by the telecommunication people in how
to get down that canyon with service.''

   A new agreement calling on the Census Bureau to
double-check its 1990 results and adjust them if necessary could
mean more federal money for some cities and changes in congressional
representation.
   The federal government agreed on Monday to examine results of the
1990 census and adjust them if necessary to correct a historical
undercount of minorities and inner city dwellers.
   ``This is a civil-rights issue, not a money issue,'' said New
York City Corporation Counsel Peter L. Zimroth. ``The money is
secondary, what we want is the most accurate count. There are people
in this country who are not brought into account. They are losing
representation.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who called the agreement a ``a great
victory'' for the city, added, ``The impact is money.''
   Relying on the one-person, one-vote doctrine, New York City _
joined by two states and several major cities with large minority
populations and civil-rights organizations _ filed suit last
November to get the census bureau to use a statistical method
devised to correct the undercount.
   The dispute focuses on drawing electoral districts for the House
of Representatives.
   Because the House is limited to 435 members, distributed
according to population, areas where people are missed in the census
lose seats to other states. In addition, many federal programs
distribute money according to population.
   Under a settlement announced in federal court, the Commerce
Department and the Census Bureau agreed to set up an eight-person
panel of statisticians and demographers to review the results of the
1990 census and recommend to the commerce secretary whether the
numbers need to be adjusted.
   The secretary will not be bound by the recommendations.
   Following the nationwide head count, the Census Bureau also will
conduct a massive followup survey, sampling 150,000 households
nationwide to determine whether the final tally should be adjusted.
   A somewhat smaller survey already was planned to evaluate the
count.
   Following criticism that it missed as much as 1 percent to 2
percent of the population in 1980, the Census Bureau already
analyzed the possibility of adjusting its figures for under-counting
of some population segments.
   However, last fall the Commerce Department, parent agency for the
Census, decided against making an adjustment.
   Commerce officials said they didn't believe any sample could be
as accurate as the national head count itself. They also said they
were concerned an adjustment would undermine public confidence in
the Census.
   That decision was widely criticized.
   Barbara Bailar, the Census official who researched methods of
adjustment, resigned. She is now head of the American Statistical
Association. Bailer could not be reached for comment on Monday's
agreement.
   In addition, some local officials accused the department of
playing politics in the decision, an accusation the department
denied.
   Because the undercount largely affects minorities and inner-city
residents _ most often represented by Democrats _ critics asserted
that Republicans stood to benefit from cancelling the adjustment
plans.
   ``The agreement provides for a careful and thorough
re-examination as to whether the census requires adjustment to
produce a more accurate population count,'' Secretary of Commerce
Robert Mosbacher said in a statement.
   In the suit joined by New York state, California, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston, Dade County, Fla., and several civil-rights
organizations, New York City charged that the methods of the Census
Bureau commonly undercount blacks, Hispanics, the homeless and
illegal aliens.
   Zimroth said the agreement potentially means ``many millions of
dollars'' for the city in federal funds lost because of the
undercounting. It also could affect legislative boundaries, which
are drawn according to population.
   According to the city, the 1980 census missed as many as 500,000
people, or 6 percent of the city's population. The mayor's office
said the city has lost out on more than $200 million since the 1980
census because of the undercounting.
   Stephen Hart, a Justice Department lawyer, said that as many as 7
percent of the nation's blacks were overlooked in previous censuses.
The Census Bureau was looking at methods to reduce the undercount,
caused by people not responding to questionnaires or not cooperating
with neighborhood canvassers.
   Monday's agreement removed a motion by the city for a preliminary
injunction that could have stopped the 1990 census.

   The U.S. Marshals Service task force that
arrested 456 fugitives over eight weeks was designed to target
people wanted in drug-related crimes in a region hard hit by the
violent narcotics trade.
   William J. Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, said the $1.3 million federal program that teamed
the marshals with local police proves ``the bad guys can be
apprehended and brought to justice.''
   The U.S. Marshals Service led the Street Terror Offender Program,
or STOP, which captured 25 fugitives charged with murder in the
Washington-Baltimore area. Some fugitives were arrested as far away
as California and Florida, officials said.
   The program, which began May 22, targeted those with an active
drug felony warrant and at least three felony drug arrests or
convictions. Also targeted were suspects with an active warrant for
a drug-related homicide.
   Among those arrested was Herbert Douglas Jr., a suspect in three
Washington homicides.
   Douglas had been sentenced to 146 years in prison after being
convicted in a 1981 shootout with police during an armed robbery,
but he was paroled after serving less than six years. He is charged
with murder in a 1987 killing and a 1989 double homicide.
   Authorities also said they arrested Tony Miller, an alias for
Sean Henry, while he was trying to hide in the Marines.
   On the day Henry's trial was to begin on charges of distribution
of cocaine, the court received a death certificate for him. He was
subsequently arrested under another name and released, but a
fingerprint check revealed his identity. He was arrested at Parris
Island, S.C., while attending Marine Corps boot camp.
   STOP targeted 840 fugitives, arrested 456 and filed detainers on
155 already jailed on other charges. A total of 229 remain at-large,
said the Marshals service.
   The program involved 56 federal marshals and 34 local officers.
Officials lauded the cooperation between federal and local agencies.
   Of those arrested, 172 were wanted for crimes in the District of
Columbia, 154 in Baltimore and 130 in suburban Maryland and Virginia.

   Republicans and Democrats, hailing the first
successful flight of the B-2 bomber, warn that the
half-billion-dollar aircraft must still clear the ``checkbook
hurdle'' in Congress.
   The radar-evading bomber, accompanied by two F-16 fighters,
performed test maneuvers during a nearly two-hour flight Monday in
Southern California _ a maiden excursion 18 months behind schedule.
   Despite the success, lawmakers stressed that the stealth bomber,
which at about $500 million a copy is the most expensive plane in
history, looms large on the radar screen of the budget-conscious
Congress.
   ``I think there's a great deal of reluctance to spend that much
money per airplane,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2
Republican leader. ``The president and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
will have to work hard to carry a vote in the House.''
   The Pentagon has proposed $4.7 billion for the stealth bomber in
the fiscal 1990 budget and about $24 billion for the program during
a peak three-year spending period in the mid-1990s.
   The House Armed Services Committee last month slashed $800
million from spending for the B-2 program. On Friday, the Senate
Armed Services Committee trimmed $300 million from the Bush
administration's request and included a series of testing
requirements before the plane could go into full production.
   The full House and Senate take up the defense bill, and the
spending level for the B-2, next week.
   ``I think it's going to be one of the most controversial items in
the defense authorization bill,'' said House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash. ``Right now I would say it's an uphill fight for the
B-2.''
   Gen. Bernard Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command,
said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show this morning that the actual
production cost would amount to $274 million per plane in 1989
dollars when such expenses as research and development and spare
parts were removed.
   Regardless of the differing cost estimates, Randolph said, ``The
real issue you have to ask is how we can afford not to have the B-2.
... (which) is fundamental to the deterrent posture of the nation.
... We're talking about an airplane that can literally penetrate
hundreds of billions of dollars of air defenses in the Soviet Union,
so this is a fantastic step forward.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and a supporter of the stealth program, said the B-2's
cost would not have been as high had the nation not gone ahead with
building the interim B-1B bomber.
   ``I think when you look at the $23 billion in (B-2) research and
development, divide that into only 100 aircraft, that's $230 million
per aircraft that we already have invested,'' Nunn said on ``CBS
This Morning.''
   ``I think it tells us something about the cost of the B-2, but it
also tells us that we should never have produced the B-1. Then we'd
be talking about 200 stealth aircraft or more, and you would be
amortizing or dividing that very large research and development
package into more aircraft,'' he said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said the bomber ``just cleared one hurdle. But the test
program just begun has far to go to answer all the technical
questions.
   ``And the B-2 has still another hurdle to clear _ the checkbook
hurdle. The issue is whether it's worth the price.''
   Members of the House plan a number of amendments on the B-2,
including a measure that would mothball the production line after
the manufacturer, Northrop Corp., has produced 13 bombers.
   After testing and evaluation, Congress would have an opportunity
to decide whether to continue or kill the program.
   Introducing the amendment will be an unusual coalition _
Republicans John Rowland of Connecticut and John Kasich of Ohio and
Democrat Ronald Dellums of California.
   The three members are planning an all-out effort to win support
for the amendment, including calls and letters to their colleagues.
But at least two members indicated Monday they won't support the
measure.
   ``Right now I'm going to offer an amendment to sustain the Cheney
budget, including full funding for B-2,'' said Rep. William
Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel.
   ``I think that at this point total termination of the program is
probably premature,'' Aspin said.
   Rowland, in response, said: ``Only in Washington can you spend $9
billion and be accused of terminating.'' The amendment would include
spending that amount to meet its requirements.
   While the battle lines were clearly defined on the House side,
members of the Senate generally expressed their support for the
program.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said he was ``very proud as an American with
this accomplishment coming 20 years after man landed on the moon.''
   But Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said no more B-2s should be funded until the
results of flight testing are received.
   ``One flight does not a test program make,'' the former astronaut
and test pilot said.

   Wanda and Henry Brannam lived in
marital bliss for 17 years, until they discovered they weren't
really married.
   Mrs. Brannam found out a week ago when she heard a news report
about a May 1 state Supreme Court ruling that declared a marriage
invalid because a divorce decree from a previous marriage wasn't
filed until after the second ceremony.
   ``I was not going to let any grass grow under my feet before I
could get things taken care of,'' she said. ``My husband at first
thought it was funny, but when I told him he was sleeping on the
couch because we weren't married, he started to pay attention to
me.''
   Mrs. Brannam was divorced March 2, 1972, and married Henry
Brannam on March 12. Her divorce papers weren't filed until March 31.
   She fretted the ruling could endanger the legal rights of her
14-year-old daughter.
   So the Brannams tied the knot, again, on the courthouse steps
last week, with the bride decked out in white satin.
   ``I hope it's better the second time around,'' she said.

   A team of scientists led by a lawyer
wearing a skull-and-crossbones T-shirt is homing in on the graves of
five gold prospectors who were slain and cannibalized 115 years ago.
   The 13 scientists and anthropologists on Monday used
radar-mapping equipment to pick up underground abnormalities that
could turn out to be the remains of the five victims of Alferd
Packer. The men died during a bitter winter in the San Juan
Mountains.
   Onlookers and hot, clear weather gave a festive atmosphere to the
dig.
   In addition to the skull and crossbones, the T-shirt worn by dig
leader James Starrs bore the legend, ``Gimme Five, The Alferd Packer
Expedition July 1989.''
   The George Washington University law professor has nicknamed the
site ``the bone zone.''
   The scientists working with Starrs were to begin digging for the
bones today based on the results of the radar mapping data.
   ``It's subtle, but after years of looking at this type of data, I
feel confident that we are in the right place,'' said Stan Smith, an
engineer who on Monday operated the radar equipment at the site 170
miles southwest of Denver.
   The scientists working with Starrs are hoping to resolve
lingering questions about how the five men died and whether Packer
consumed their remains.
   The gold-hunting party formed by Packer became snowbound on the
9,000-foot pass in 1874. Maintaining one of the members of the party
killed the four others, Packer said he was forced to kill the fifth
in self-defense. Packer also admitted to consuming the remains of
the five to survive.
   Packer eventually was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to
40 years in prison. He was paroled in 1901 and died April 24, 1907.
   The scientists are searching near a grave marker that was erected
to the victims in an area known as ``Deadman's Gulch,'' between
Cannibalism Plateau and Round Top Mountain, two miles south of Lake
City.
   The marker honors the five men ``who were murdered on this spot
early in the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources of the
San Juan country.''
   The scientists were watched by residents and tourists who were
kept behind barricades erected by the Hinsdale County Sheriff's
Department.
   Observers joked that the scientists probably would unearth the
remains of such celebrities as Jimmy Hoffa, or Elvis Presley belt
buckles. Many sat in lawn chairs, with coolers of refreshments by
their sides.
   Although Starrs is fairly certain the group will locate the
bones, Walter Birkby, curator of physical anthropology at the
Arizona State Museum in Tucson who is on the dig, was less confident.
   He said there is no guarantee any bones were ``down there at
all.''
   ``It would be wonderful to have 206 bones for each individual,
but it's bloody unlikely,'' Birkby said. ``We don't know if anything
is there, and we won't until we actually start digging.''
   The dig differs from usual practices of archaeologists, who often
are secretive about their research. Starrs, however, said his goal
to raise $10,000 to fund the expedition has not been reached,
leading him to encourage media coverage.
   The group has set aside the week to search for the bones. Any
findings will be sent to the Arizona State Museum at Tucson for
analysis.
   Next month, Starrs plans to restore the site to its
pre-exhumation condition. The expedition's results are scheduled to
be released early next year.

<HEAD>State Blames Mismanagement For Nation's Worst Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's worst oil spill resulted
from ``arrogant and complacent'' managers who failed to prevent the
accident and then failed to move quickly to contain the spreading
ooze, a state study concluded.
   Robert LeResche, who heads the state's inquiry into the grounding
of the Exxon Valdez, said in a report issued Monday that poor
management by Exxon Shipping Co., not ``a berserk captain,'' is to
blame for the spill.
   ``Exxon Shipping's failures and lapses in management were so
numerous and pervasive that it is a wonder the Exxon Valdez was the
first tanker grounded,'' LeResche said.
   He described Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.'s response after the
spill in similar terms, calling it a ``total _ massive _
incredible'' failure and likening it to something out of the
Keystone Kops.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 shortly after leaving
Valdez, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince
William Sound.
   ``The real causes of the Exxon Valdez disaster were not heroic,
but only pedestrian,'' LeResche said. ``There was not a berserk
captain waving a bottle on the bridge, there was not an autopilot
device run amok, there was not a broken radar, or a storm.
   ``There were simply arrogant and complacent people at the top
levels of Exxon Shipping Co. and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. who
did not pay attention to their responsibilities.''
   LeResche's comments were contained in 110-page document submitted
to the National Transportation Safety Board. The document is the
state's proposed findings and recommendations based on the NTSB's
week-long hearings in Anchorage in May. The NTSB will issue its own
findings later.
   LeResche was the state's representative during the hearings.
   Calls for comment to Exxon Shipping offices in San Diego and
Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Houston, Texas, were not returned Monday.
   But Alyeska, a consortium of seven oil companies _ including
Exxon _ that operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the Valdez
tanker terminal, rejected LeResche's conclusions.
   ``We totally disagree with the findings,'' said Alyeska spokesman
Tom Brennan.
   ``Nothing Alyeska could have done in the first 24 hours of the
spill would have significantly affected the course or environmental
impact of the spill,'' Brennan said. He repeated the company's
contention that the spill was simply too big to manage, ``even if
all the resources in the world had been instantaneously available.''
   Alyeska also renewed its claim that its response was hamstrung by
the unwillingness of the state and the Coast Guard to allow the use
of chemical dispersants and burning to dissipate the spill. The
state and the Coast Guard repeatedly have dismissed Alyeska's
argument in the past.
   LeResche chided Exxon Shipping for its ``amateurish and
bumbling'' attempt to monitor and assist skipper Joseph Hazelwood
after his 1985 treatment for alcoholism.
   The report also accused Exxon Shipping of failing to plan for
crew rest and alertness on trips from Valdez, trying to reduce
manning levels aboard tankers with little regard for crew safety,
and failing to provide the ship's officers with needed management
skills and a stable work force.
   As for Hazelwood, the report said his judgment was impaired at
the time of the accident, he left the bridge when he should have
been on it and he endangered the ship further after the grounding by
trying to free the Exxon Valdez from a reef.
   Hazelwood has been charged with three misdemeanor and three
felony crimes, and is scheduled to stand trial this fall. Hazelwood
pleaded innocent to all charges.
   The state report includes 13 recommendations for the NTSB,
including increased drug and alcohol testing for tanker crew members
and enhanced navigational aids in Prince William Sound.

<HEAD>Unexplained Radiation Found Near Site Of Soviet Submarine Mishap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traces of radiation were found in the air
filter of a Norwegian ship that shadowed a stricken Soviet nuclear
submarine near the Norwegian coast, scientists said today.
   The tiny amount of radioactive Iodine 131 could have been left
over from a previous accident or other ships that the Norwegian
vessel trailed, said researcher Gunnar Saxeboel of the Norwegian
Institute on Radiation Hygiene.
   Soviet officials had denied radioactivity was released from the
Alfa-class sub that surfaced Sunday and released clouds of black
smoke 75 miles east of the Norwegian coast in the Barents Sea and 30
miles north of Soviet territorial waters.
   Norwegian officials thought the smoke was from a fire, but Moscow
said it came from auxiliary diesel engines the sub had to start up
after a short circuit in a battery forced the shutdown of the
reactor.
   ``Preliminary tests don't prove any radioactivity that can be
traced to the submarine reactor,'' said a statement from the
institute. But it did not rule out the submarine as the source.
Water samples from the area proved free of radiation.
   ``The filter may have been on the ship for a long time and the
amount of radiation is so small that there is no danger of
contamination,'' said Saxeboel.
   Saxeboel speculated the isotope could have come from a Soviet
power plant on the Kola Pennisula or from another Soviet ship.
   The Norwegian ship, the Mariatta, was in the Norwegian Sea on
June 26 when a fire broke out on another Soviet submarine. The
Soviet Tass news agency reported four sailors suffered radiation
poisoning but later said the four were healthy.
   Norway complained of Soviet tardiness in reporting three
accidents aboard Soviet nuclear submarines near its shores in less
than four months.
   The supreme commander of the Soviet fleet, Adm. Vladimir
Chernavin, said in an interview published in the Soviet newspaper
Pravda today that warnings will be promptly issued in the future,
the Norwegian news agency NTB reported from Moscow.
   ``If there ever is a problem with radiation, information will
immediately be provided,'' the admiral was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
   Leslie Sferrazza, twice the ex-wife of Reno
Mayor Pete Sferrazza, says she recovered part of her shattered ego
when she uncovered for Playboy magazine.
   ``After my breakup with Peter, I really had a poor self-image,''
Ms. Sferrazza said Monday. ``Playboy restored my self-confidence.''
   The 25-year-old blonde said posing in the nude came naturally
after extensive local publicity about her two stormy marriages to
the mayor.
   ``I feel my life is so open to the public that I might as well
have done Playboy. People in this town have sometimes judged me so
bitterly that I wanted to give people the chance to know the real
me.''
   Ms. Sferrazza wouldn't say how much she was paid for the
non-centerfold pictorial, which is due out next week.
   When first told of his ex-wife's upcoming Playboy appearance,
Sferrazza said, ``I wished her the best of success. What else can I
say?''
   In the interview that goes with her photos, Ms. Sferrazza says
she'd still vote for her ex-husband: ``I hope the voters of Reno are
smart enough to vote on Peter's political, not his personal, life.
He's been a fine politician.''

   An elementary school teacher and author who has
developed a technique for young children to act out their
classmates' fantasies has been awarded $355,000 by a philanthropic
foundation.
   Vivian Gussin Paley, 60, a teacher at the University of Chicago
Laboratory School, will receive the money with no requirements. She
can do with it whatever she wants.
   Mrs. Paley is one of 29 people awarded fellowships, ranging from
$150,000 to $375,000, by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation. Also among the recipients was the producer of the
documentary ``The Thin Blue Line,'' that movie that led to the
release of a Texas inmate convicted of murder.
   ``She deserves every accolade she gets,'' a colleague, Lucinda
Katz, said Monday after Mrs. Paley's award was announced. ``She's a
wonderful teacher.''
   Mrs. Paley has spent 32 years in the classroom _ 18 at the Lab
School _ and is the author five books on her teaching experience.
   She believes that children solve their problems through play, and
her technique of ``storyplaying'' allows children to tell stories
and the classroom to act them out.
   A total of 283 fellows ranging in age from 18 to 82 have been
named since the program began in 1981.
   There is no way to apply for a MacArthur Fellowship. Potential
recipients are proposed to the foundation by a group of more than
100 designated nominators throughout the country, who serve
anonymously and come from a variety of professions.

<HEAD>Shadowy Chinese Group Threatens to Kill Japanese</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 8 grafs to UPDATE with journalist, dissident arrested;

   Accusing Japan of colluding with China's
``dictatorial government'' and plotting an economic invasion, a
Chinese group has threatened to kill two Japanese in China each
month, Japan's embassy said today.
   The previously unknown group, which calls itself the Blood-Bright
Dare To Die Squad, sent a letter written in Chinese to Japan
Airline's Beijing office and said the killings would start Aug. 15.
   The letter concluded: ``Please tell other countries, if they
collude with the dictatorial government, they will meet the same
fate.'' Japan Airlines, which received the letter Monday afternoon,
released copies of it today.
   The anti-government tone suggested the group might be linked to
students whose nationwide pro-democracy protests were crushed by the
army in Beijing and by police in other cities. Students and
supporters in many cities formed ``dare to die squads'' during the
democracy movement.
   Police rounding up participants in the seven weeks of protests
arrested a leading journalist, Dai Qing, and Yang Wei, a recently
freed dissident linked to a New York-based Chinese group.
   The husband of Ms. Dai, contacted by telephone, said plainclothes
police came to their home Thursday during dinner and led her away,
saying they wanted to talk to her. He said he had not heard from her
since.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Shanghai police arrested
Yang on today on charges of ``conducting demagogical propaganda for
counterrevolutionary ends.'' Yang, 33, was jailed from 1987 until
January on similar charges.
   Several Western embassies said there were no reports of other
companies, Japanese or non-Japanese, receiving threats from the
Chinese group.
   ``We don't know how serious this is,'' said Hideo Watanabe, first
secretary of the Japanese Embassy. He said the embassy contacted
Beijing police and planned a meeting with them later today.
   Communist China has no known terrorist organizations, although
sporadic acts of sabotage are reported from time to time and usually
are attributed to disgruntled individuals.
   Official controls and supervision extend to many aspects of daily
life, making it difficult for underground groups to operate.
   But there has been speculation since the army killed hundreds of
unarmed civilians June 4 in running student protesters out of
central Beijing that some of protesters would turn to underground
activity.
   When dynamite exploded on a Shanghai-bound train June 26, killing
24 people, authorities said they suspected sabotage. Results of a
police investigation have not been released.
   A Japan Airlines official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he believed the letter writers' real target was the Chinese
government, not Japan. ``I think the person selected Japan Airlines
because (it) is comparatively famous,'' he said. He said he did not
believe the threat would be carried out.
   However, he said it was up to the airline's head office and the
embassy to decide if any safety precautions should be taken.
   The letter, written in block-like, almost childish characters,
said:
   ``Because the Japanese pirates collude with the Communist Party
dictatorial government and plot to launch a large-scale economic
invasion of China, from today we, the Blood-Bright Dare to Die
Squad, enter into a state of war with the Japanese pirates.''
   It said if Japan did not repent ``we will kill one Japanese
pirate in China each week.'' The group said its targets would be
businessmen, tourists and friends of the Chinese Communist Party.
   Students, journalists and diplomats and their families were
exempt, the letter said. It made no specific demands.
   Watanabe said there are about 1,000 Japanese living in Beijing,
about half the number before the June army attack on the protesters.
Many foreigners fled China in the following days.
   Some Japanese businessmen have returned since, but most say they
are reluctant to put more money into China. The Japanese government
has halted high-level contacts with China and frozen development aid.
   Few Japanese tourists have returned.
   In the only other known case of a terrorist threat being made
against foreign nationals, Chinese authorities told the U.S. Embassy
in June 1988 that nationals of an unidentified third country planned
a terrorist attack on Americans in Beijing.
   The embassy issued an alert but lifted it three days later when
the Chinese said the danger was over. No details of the threat were
ever made public.

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas Kill 30 Rival Rebels in Power Struggle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fundamentalist guerrilla group today
acknowledged killing at least some fighters of a rival faction after
reports it ambushed and executed 30 fighters of the competing force.
   Rebel sources said the two groups are locked in a power struggle
that could hinder efforts to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan
government.
   Reacting Monday to the earlier reports of the killings on July 9
in Takhar Province about 140 miles north of Kabul, Bush
administration officials deplored the attack but said U.S. support
to the Afghan guerrillas would remain intact.
   ``Our commitment to support the mujahedeen is very clear and the
nature and character of our support is unchanged and it will
continue,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. The
guerrillas call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   The dead, including seven key commanders, belonged to the
fundamentalist Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group. Jamiat-e-Islami said
the ambush was carried out by the rival Hezb-e-Islami group, which
is led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar.
   Jamiat spokesman said Mohammad Shaoib said five people were
killed in the ambush, and 25 others were later executed. Spokesman
Qaribur Rehman Saeed, of the Hezb-e-Islami group, denied anyone was
executed, but he acknowledged at least some of the killings.
   Saeed did not say how many guerrillas were killed, and he said
his group was still investigating what happened.
   Hekmatyar is a hard-line, anti-American fundamentalist. Despite
his anti-U.S. stand, the United States has backed him and other
guerrilla commanders who are trying to overthrow President Najib's
government in Afghanistan.
   The struggle for power between the guerrillas has been waged
almost since the outset of the decade-old war. It has left scores of
Afghan rebels from both groups dead, guerrilla sources said today.
   The forces killed in the latest attack were from Afghanistan's
northern provinces of Badakhshan, Kunduz, Takhar and Baghlan. They
were returning from a strategy meeting with Jamiat commander Atmad
Shah Masood, said Shaoib.
   Shaoib gave no details of the attack or executions.
   ``It is a great loss for all Afghanistan, especially for the
north,'' he said.
   ``In the northern provinces, there are only two powers, Jamiat
and Hezb,'' said Saeed. ``Many of our commanders have been killed by
Masood's people.''
   Masood formed a northern council to incorporate guerrillas
belonging to the seven rebel parties with headquarters in Pakistan's
border city of Peshawar. In a message to his headquarters in
Pakistan more than one year ago, Masood said he was consolidating
forces and establishing an Islamic army.
   Saeed said, ``The conflict started right from the beginning when
Masood wanted the upper hand in the north.''
   ``Masood wanted to clear the area of Hezb mujahedeen,'' he said.
   He said had Masood agreed to temporary cease-fires with Soviet
troops during their nine years of Afghan military intervention
ending in February. Rival clashes broke out when Hezb-e-Islami
forces refused to recognize those arrangements, said Saeed.
   Another rebel source, who spoke on condition of anonmity, said,
``Both the sides are greedy .... They want more and more control.''
   Rebel sources independent of either group, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said they fear the latest round of killings could
cripple guerrilla efforts to gain control of government-controlled
cities in the north.
   Sources within Jamiat said Masood's strategy has been to
concentrate on northern cities, particularly Kunduz, Baghlan and
Badakhshan.
   A moderate rebel who spoke on condition anonymity, said Masood's
troops could not approach the Afghan capital, Kabul, even if they
wanted because they are blocked by Hezb-e-Islami forces in central
Parwan province.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, officials said today that senior U.S. and
Soviet officials will meet there on July 31 for talks on Afghanistan.
   Swedish news reports said the talks likely will focus on U.S. and
Soviet arms supplies to the opposing sides in the civil war.

<HEAD>Government, Opposition, List Agenda for Further Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials said more talks are planned
between the government and opposition despite the government's
insistence that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega will not step down.
   The two sides announced an agenda Monday after the first meeting
to include military representatives since the May 7 election that
intensified the country's political crisis.
   Diplomats from the Organization of American States who arranged
and were mediating the talks were to leave today for Washington. On
Wednesday, they report to the OAS on the progress of their effort.
   Negotiations will resume when opposition representatives return
from the OAS meeting, a government representative said.
   Noriega, who chief of the Defense Forces and de facto leader of
the country, did not attend the Monday meeting. Instead, he attended
a session of the State Council, which is studying a proposal for
forming a junta after Sept. 1, when the civilian government's term
ends.
   Asked about the country's political situation, he said nothing
but reached into the seat of his car and, smiling, took out a police
club and waved it at journalists.
   In addition to Noriega's departure as chief of the Panamanian
Defense Forces, the opposition agenda includes: defining what is
meant by transfer of power; the elections, which international
observers say the opposition won by a 3-1 margin, and human rights
violations.
   Government and military representatives listed: an end to U.S.
aggression and military threats against Panama; withdrawal of
additional U.S. troops sent to Panama; an end to economic aggression
and return of Panamanian funds held by the United States; strict
compliance with the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, and no U.S.
interference in Panamanian political affairs.
   Under the treaties, Panama is to take full control of the canal
at the end of 1999.
   International observers say Noriega rigged the presidential
election in favor of his candidate, Carlos Duque, and had it
annulled when the fraud and opposition victory became obvious.
   The opposition and the United States have insisted for a year and
a half that Noriega step down as chief of Defense Forces. Noriega
refuses.
   Noriega was indicted in the United States on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges, but he denies the charges and says they
are part of a U.S. attempt to retain control of the canal.
   As part of its effort to force Noriega to leave, the United
States froze Panamanian government deposits in U.S. banks, barred
payments to the Panamanian government and increased its military
strength in the Canal Zone.

   A nuclear plant supervisor who deliberately
drank lemonade laced with radioactive material is under
investigation, but officials said today they had no ready
explanation for the act.
   The dose of radioactive material swallowed by the supervisor at
the James A. FitzPatrick plant was not life-threatening and was
equal to the amount of radiation in five chest X-rays, officials
said. He didn't require hospitalization or medical treatment.
   ``There are a lot of questions unanswered and we are attempting
to get the answers,'' said Cliff Spieler, spokesman for the New York
Power Authority, which runs the plant.
   The authority released a statement Monday saying the worker told
investigators that he had put radioactive material in a bottle of
lemonade before drinking the liquid. Spieler refused to say what
reason the man gave.
   The supervisor was idenitified by the power authority only as a
worker for Institute of Resource Management, a Maryland company
under contract to provide short-term workers at the Lake Ontario
plant.
   Wayne Schmidt, senior resident inspector for the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, said he was a radiation supervisor on the
plant's refuel floor, an area where fuel is loaded and unloaded from
the reactor.
   A radiation detector alerted officials to the presence of
radioactive cobalt inside the man's body as he walked through the
whole-body detector while leaving the plant Friday, Schmidt said.
   In addition to cobalt-60, the man also swallowed cesium-137 and
manganese-54, Schmidt said.
   The man's estimated dose of radiation was between 50 and 100
millirems, he said. A single chest X-ray has 10 to 20 millirems.
   He man was given laxatives and cranberry juice and was detained
at the plant until the material had passed from his system and could
be analyzed, officials said.
   The plant did not have to declare an ``unusual event,'' the
lowest of four types of public emergency warnings, because the
radiation dose was so low, he said.

   An Arab teen-ager died after the car she was
riding in overturned after being stoned by Palestinian activists who
may have attacked the vehicle because of its Israeli plates, a
hospital official said today.
   Raeda Issa Suleiman, 14, of Beit Safafa in the Jerusalem area,
died of head injuries she suffered when the car she was riding in
was stoned Sunday in the West Bank town of Bethany. Three others in
the car were injured.
   Police and residents said her car apparently was mistaken for an
Israeli vehicle because it had yellow Israeli license plates instead
of blue West Bank tags.
   Hadassah Hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said Ms. Suleiman was
declared dead Monday night.
   Her death brings to 566 the number of Palestinians killed in the
19-month uprising. Thirty-six Israelis have also have been killed in
the uprising.
   Army prosecutors meanwhile filed charges against two Palestinian
shepherds, Fahem Ramadan Shihan Ali and Mustafa Othman Omar Al-Haj,
both 21. They are accused of stabbing to death Steven Rosenfeld, a
Jewish settler who immigrated from Washington, D.C.
   He was killed June 17 while hiking near the suspects' West Bank
village of Burkin.
   A third, unidentified Palestinian shepherd is suspected of
participating but has not yet been charged, the army said.
   Ali and Al-Haj were accused of membership in the outlawed Fatah
group, Yasser Arafat's mainstream faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Praise, Criticism from Dutch Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush won praise from
Dutch government officials today for his knowledge of European
affairs, mixed with criticism from an opposition leader over the
environment and other issues.
   Duth Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said the first visit by
an American president to the Netherlands had established ``a new
marker'' in the two centuries of close ties between the two
countries.
   Joep de Boer, a parliamentarian for Premier Ruud Lubbers'
Christian Democratic Appeal party, called Bush ``the most European
oriented president there has been for years.''
   Bush conferred with 11 Dutch politicians over breakfast before
departing for Washington at the end of his four-nation, 10-day trip
to Europe.
   Bush also met privately for 30 minutes before breakfast with
Dutch opposition leader Wim Kok, leader of the opposition Labor
party and a likely winner of elections scheduled for Sept. 6.
   Aboard Air Force One, Bush told reporters the Dutch politicians
had expressed strong views on the environment and other issues that
at times bordered on argument.
   Kok told reporters after the meeting that he had argued for
U.S.-Soviet negotiations on elemininating both superpowers' arsenals
of short-range nuclear missiles.
   Kok also criticized Bush for not endorsing a Dutch government
plan to enlist United Nations help in setting up monitoring rules to
protect the atmosphere's delicate ozone layer.
   ``The attitude of the Americans towards strenghtening the United
Nations in environmental matters is too reluctant,'' said Kok.
   During his Dutch visit, Bush reiterated the NATO position that
the allies must first press for substantial reductions in
conventional troops and weaponry in Europe before seeking a treaty
with the Soviets on short-range nuclear weapons.
   ``As regards his attitude towards the Soviet Union, Bush is more
cautious then we are. We can do a lot more ... to give the process
of economic and political reform a chance,'' said Kok, whose party
helped orchestrate nationwide opposition to basing 48 U.S.-built
cruise missiles on Dutch soil in the early 1980s.
   Although the Lubbers' government decided to go ahead with the
plan, the missiles never came, because of the 1987 U.S.-Soviet pact
to ban all intermediate range nuclear wapons.
   Van den Broek, in a radio interview, called the Bush visit
``extremely gratifying and successful.''
   ``In the uninterrupted relations between our two countries this
is a new marker in a long era of mutual friendship,'' the foreign
minister said.
   Joris Voorhoeve, leader of the right-wing Liberals, junior
partner in the coalition government, said Bush had offered ``the
American prescription'' of lower taxes to speed up economic growth
as a cure for the Netherlands' economic woes.
   Although Dutch economic growth is above average for the 12
nations of the European Economic Community, the nation still suffers
a crippling 14-percent unemployment rate.
   De Boer, his party's foreign affairs spokesman, said he had
warned the president about the resurgence of ``nationalism'' in West
Germany. ``I'm totally reassured. They are aware of the problem,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski
reversed himself today and said he will be a candidate for
president, which the National Assembly is to elect Wednesday.
   Also today, bus and tram drivers in the country's most populous
province of Katowice went on strike for higher pay, a sign of
growing public dissatisfaction with the beleaguered economy a new
president will face.
   Gen. Jaruzelski had declared June 30 that he was not a candidate,
saying he was too closely linked to the 1981 martial-law crackdown
that attempted to crush Solidarity and not closely enough with
democratic changes now sweeping Poland.
   He proposed the candidacy of a longtime loyalist, Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak. But Communist leaders asked Jaruzelski to
reconsider and he appeared in the last few weeks to be leaning
toward running.
   A victory hinges on how whether the Communist coalition, which
has a majority of the seats in the National Assembly, will stand
behind its leader.
   The presidency, whose powers include control of the military and
foreign relations, was a result of government-Solidarity talks in
the spring. The negotiations also brought elections in June in which
Solidarity candidates were limited to winning a minority number of
seats in the National Assembly.
   On Monday, Jaruzelski met with Solidarity lawmakers and submitted
to nearly six hours of questioning in an attempt to win votes.
   But as the Solidarity delegation convened this afternoon to
decide how to vote, the opposition lawmakers indicated they doubted
there would be any support among them for Jaruzelski.
   ``I feel he is responsible for all of the mistakes. He is
responsible so I cannot support him,'' said Zofia Kuratowska, a
deputy speaker of the Senate.
   The new president will seat a government that must deal with
worsening consumer shortages and inflation that, based on a new
statistics for the first six months of 1989, appears headed for an
annual rate of 160 percent.
   The vote Wednesday is to be a roll call, which should make it
easier for coalition leaders to insist that each lawmaker vote for
Jaruzelski.
   The state-run PAP news agency said Jaruzelski, announcing his
candidacy today at a meeting of Communist lawmakers, said he was
``driven by a sense of duty'' in heeding the urging of party leaders
that he run.
   To win approval, Jaruzelski would need the votes of nearly all
coalition lawmakers because the coalition holds a 54 percent
majority in the National Assembly. The president is to be chosen by
a simple majority during a joint session of the 100-member Senate
and 460-member Sejm.
   Some members of the Communist and affliiated Peasant Party were
elected to in June's balloting with Solidarity support and it is not
clear if they could support a Jaruzelski candidacy.
   Under the April agreement that reinstated Solidarity, the free
trade union movement was only allowed to field candidates for 46
percent of the 560 seats in the two-chamber assembly. It won all but
one of those seats.
   On Friday, Solidarity chief Lech Walesa said he would cooperate
with Jaruzelski if the general is elected. He said political
conditions require that the president come from within the Communist
coalition.
   There are fears that a non-Communist president would provoke a
dangerous reaction from hard-liners at home and elsewhere in the
Soviet bloc.
   Solidarity lawmakers who met with him on Monday said Jaruzelski
did not sufficiently repudiate the 1981 crackdown or Poland's
participation in the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed ``Prague
Spring'' reforms in Czechoslovakia.
   Jaruzelski was defense minister at the time. He has led Poland
for 8{ years and this year presided over the reinstatement of
Soldarity. Under a revamped constitution, the new president is to
serve up to two six-year terms.
   Senator Karol Modzelewski of Wroclaw, speaking for the Solidarity
lawmakers, stressed Monday that Walesa's endorsement of Jaruzelski
does not mean they feel bound to vote for the general.
   It appeared virtually certain that the Solidarity group would
feel bound to somehow register their dissatisfaction with Jaruzelski.
   Walesa's statement and words of praise for Jaruzelski from
President Bush during his trip to Poland July 9-11 are considered to
have helped persuade Jaruzelski to run.
   If Jaruzelski becomes president, he said Monday, he would give up
the post of party chief, according to Solidarity lawmakers.

   Herbert von Karajan, the brilliant
Austrian maestro and long-time conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic,
was buried in a small ceremony in his hometown near Salzburg, a
spokesman at the Salzburg Festival said today.
   Karajan, who died Sunday of heart failure at 81, was buried
Monday night in the family crypt in Anif, said the spokesman on
condition of anonymity.
   A religious service in the local parish church attended by few
family members and guests preceded the burial, he said.
   ``It was the wish of his wife Eliette Mouret and his daughters,
Isabelle and Arabelle, that the ceremony be held without a furor in
a small circle of relatives and friends,'' the spokesman said.
   Karajan was to have opened this year's festival July 27 with
Giuseppe Verdi's Opera ``A Masked Ball,'' starring Placido Domingo.
   Festival officials said the celebrations to follow the premier
would be canceled and the festival would hold a formal memorial
ceremony for Karajan on July 30 with the Vienna Philharmonic and the
Vienna state Opera choir. Riccardo Muti and Sir Georg Solti are to
conduct, festival officials said.
   The Festival directorate said Solti would replace Karajan
conducting the Verdi opera at the premiere and three planned
performaces after that.
   However, it was not yet known who would conduct the remaining
three performances of the opera and a concert with the Vienna
Philharmonic in August that was to have been conducted by Karajan.

   The Detroit Symphony Orchestra says it will be
unable to pay regular biweekly salaries to 155 employees this week
because of worsening financial problems.
   Symphony Chairman Robert S. Miller announced Monday there was
``no way'' the orchestra would be able to come up with the $200,000
needed to give 97 musicians and 58 other staff members their full
checks Thursday.
   The Detroit Federation of Musicians, which represents the
symphony members, agreed to continue performing if the symphony
could issue one-week paychecks. Symphony finance committee chairman
Alfred R. Glancy III said he expected to learn today if that was
possible.
   Miller said last month that the symphony would close in mid-July
unless the state, city and businesses pledged $18.2 million for the
next four years to help it overcome chronic financial problems.
   Since then, state, city and corporate leaders have given hopeful
signs of additional funding but no hard commitments, spokeswoman
Mary Loiselle said today.
   ``We have made a lot of progress and we are encouraged by that,''
Lioselle said. ``But in the mean time, the cash is running out.''
   The symphony has an $8 million debt that officials have said will
reach $16 million by 1993.

   Victims of the Bhopal gas disaster will
launch a weeklong campaign in August to ban Union Carbide Corp. from
India, an activist said today.
   Abdul Jabbar Khan, organizer of the Bhopal Gas-Affected Women's
Organization, said the group will hold public meetings beginning
Aug. 9 to support its demand and urge shopkeepers not to sell Union
Carbide products.
   The main product sold by the chemical company in India is
batteries. It also sells flashlights and other products in India.
   A gas leak in December 1984 from a pesticide plant operated by
the U.S. multinational's Indian subsidiary left at least 3,100
people dead and more than 20,000 injured.
   Khan said the campaign will end with an attempt by protesters to
enter the plant and demands that it be declared a national monument
in memory of the victims.

   No cause of death could be determined
for the seven bodies dug up in the yard of a boardinghouse operator
who has been charged with killing her tenants, the Sacramento County
coroner says.
   Coroner Charles Simmons issued a statement Monday saying that
although drugs were found in all seven, their significance could not
be determined because of decomposition. Also, no other traumas that
might have caused death were detected.
   Boardinghouse operator Dorothea Puente, 60, remains in jail
without bail on charges of murdering the seven, plus two others
whose bodies were found elsewhere. She has pleaded innocent. A
preliminary hearing is scheduled for Sept. 12.
   Puente is accused of doing away with residents of her downtown
boardinghouse in order to cash their Social Security checks.
   Her attorney, Assistant Public Defender Peter Vlautin, said the
coroner's results ``are consistent with all we know about the case.
Dorothea Puente is innocent of any allegation of murder, and these
results just confirm that.''
   Simmons' report said that in all seven cases the drug flurazepam,
a sleeping pill sold under the brand name Dalmane, was found. An
anti-convulsant called Degratol was found in two cases.
   In three of the bodies, Elavil, an antidepressant known as
amitriptyline, was found. And the tranquilizer Valium, painkiller
codeine, tranquilizer Haldol, tranquilizer loxapine and
anticonvulsant Dilantin were found in one or two other cases.

   A body found in the Mohawk River has
been identified as the last missing victim of the 1987 collapse of a
bridge on the New York State Thruway, police said today.
   A boater spotted the body in the river near Schenectady on
Saturday, said Sgt. Ralph Reichert of the Schenectady County

   Relatives of Edward Meyer tentatively identified the body late
Monday from keys, jewelry and clothing found on the remains, said
state Trooper Edward F. Dyer.
   Meyer was one of 10 people killed when rain-swollen Schoharie
Creek eroded away bridge supports and six cars and one truck fell
more than 80 feet on April 5, 1987. The nine other bodies were
recovered.
   Meyer, 50, a chief gas mechanic for Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.,
was returning to Albany with two co-workers from a bowling
tournament in Syracuse when the bridge collapsed.

   Flag burner Gregory Johnson ``will have
succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of his fetid imagination'' if
the nation adopts a flag-burning amendment shrinking basic rights, a
constitutional scholar testified today.
   ``He will have succeeded in making the greatest nation on earth,
if we give him this amendment, look just a little silly, a little
less brave and a little less free,'' said Walter E. Dellinger III of
Duke University law school.
   He testified at the beginning of two days of hearings by the
House Judiciary Committee's constitutional law subcommittee on the
Bush administration's proposed constitutional amendment to ban flag
burning.
   Dellinger said the nation should beware of any stampede toward an
amendment curtailing the rights of dissidents. He said many
Americans have tolerated freedom of speech when it was painful to do
so and changing the system now would be unfair to them.
   Johnson ``will have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of his
fetid imagination,'' Dellinger said.
   Johnson was arrested in Dallas during the 1984 Republican
National Convention following a protest that ended with
demonstrators igniting an American flag authorities said was taken
from a pole outside a bank building.
   He denied he actually ignited the flag, but said he approved the
action and gave speeches during the protest. He claimed he was
singled out for prosecution because Dallas police knew he was a
member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade.
   The Supreme Court threw out his conviction in ruling that flag
burning is a form of free speech protected by the Constitution.
   In a statement at the outset of the hearing, Rep. James F.
Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., urged lawmakers to ``be serious and frame
the issues as they are in reality _ whether we really want to carve
an exception out fo the First Amendment and hold our honored and
revered flag above all else or whether we want to let the flag
burners have their way.''
   A man who might have made the ruling come out differently, if the
Senate had not rejected his nomination to the Supreme Court, is
scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
   Robert Bork has said he would have upheld the Texas statute if he
were on the court. The man who took the seat Bork would have had _
Anthony Kennedy _ provided the fifth vote in the 5-4 majority that
overturned the flag ruling.
   Bork, who is now with a Washington think tank, contends Congress
must now go ahead with a constitutional amendment if it wants to
overcome the court's decision.
   There's near total agreement in Congress that something must be
done about the ruling. However, there are some, mostly Democrats,
who are hesitant to amend the Constitution and especially in a way
that restricts individual rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., plans to bring a simple
statute before the chamber before the August recess. Supporters of
that approach hope the issue which seemed so urgent at the time of
the court decision as the Fourth of July holiday approached will
fade.
   However, President Bush is behind a constitutional amendment that
has already been introduced in the House by Minority Leader Bob
Michel, R-Ill., and that Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
planned to introduce in the Senate.
   Many Democrats, remembering last year's presidential campaign in
which Bush visited a flag factory, fear that voting against the
constitutional amendment will let Republicans portray them in the
next election as somehow less patriotic.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, last week
promised that both the statute and the constitutional amendment
would see Senate action. He and Dole have agreed to hold those votes
in October.

<HEAD>Chinese Dissidents' News Conference Breaks up in Disarray</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A news conference called by exiled Chinese
dissidents broke up in disarray Tuesday as student leaders arrived
late and then fled, apparently in fear.
   Held at a hotel off the Place de la Republique, the dissidents
were supposed to announce the formation of the ``United Democratic
Front'' to oppose authorities in Beijing.
   But no one showed up. The hotel management asked the 30
journalists who had gathered to leave.
   As they dispersed, two taxis pulled up, the first bearing Wu'er
Kaixi, one of the best-known leaders of the student-led movement for
democracy, and three compatriots.
   Reporters said Wu'er appeared confused and frightened and sped
off immediately.
   A second taxi arrived carrying Yan Jiaqui, onetime adviser to
Zhao Ziyan, former secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party,
and Liu Bin Yan, a Chinese author exiled in the United States. They
spoke between themselves in Chinese outside the hotel.
   Asked for a translation, another dissident said only that they
were calling for the non-violent overthrow of ``the tyrannical
regime in power in Beijing.''
   Reporters said Yan and Liu also appeared nervous and confused.
   Wu'er, 21, and eight other Chinese dissidents surfaced in France
two weeks ago after escaping China to Hong Kong through a secret
underground network.
   Both he and Yan Jiaqi, the leader of the dissident intellectual
movement, have said they have neither asked for nor received special
protection from French authorities.
   The dissidents held their first news conference in Paris on July
12, calling for the United Nations to investigate the June 3-4
killing of unarmed demonstrators in Beijing.
   China has repeatedly protested France's granting refuge to the
dissidents as an ``unfriendly action.''
   Hundreds of Chinese students wearing headbands with Chinese
characters reading ``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' rode bicycles
in the Bastille Day parade through Paris on Friday, and carried a
banner saying ``We Carry On.''

   The Cambodian resistance says next
week's peace negotiations may fail because Vietnam refuses to
resolve key issues and looks upon talks ``as part of the war and not
part of the search for peace.''
   Hopes for a settlement are the brightest yet because the warring
factions have agreed to meet in Paris on July 24-25 and join an
international conference with the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council five days later.
   A guerrilla radio broadcast Monday, however, said success hinged
on Vietnam's sincerity and mentioned ``recent historical lessons.''
   A text, seen Tuesday, said Vietnam's wars with France and the
United States showed that it ``always considered the negotiating
stage as part of the war, and not part of the search for peace as
expected by the rest of the world.
   ``One thing is indisputable: Not even once has Vietnam respected
any negotiated agreements,'' the broadcast said.
   The Vietnamese refuse to work out a comprehensive settlement on
the futures of the Vietnamese-sponsored government in Cambodia and
the Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group, and oppose deployment
of a peacekeeping force, the broadcast said.
   ``Vietnam loudly states that it wants peace more than anything
else, but Vietnam blocks every key leading to this peace,'' the
radio said. ``Vietnam's odious goal would always be to use the
negotiating stage ... as a forum to gain some reprieve at a time
when its economy is moribound. In this case, we of the Cambodian
resistance will ... fight on.''
   Three guerrilla groups oppose Vietnam's decade-old occupation of
Cambodia _ the Khmer Rouge, Khmer People's National Liberation Front
and the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former ruler of Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded in December 1978, ousting the brutal Khmer Rouge
regime led by Pol Pot, and the civil war began after the Vietnamese
installed a new government in Phnom Penh the next month. Hanoi has
pledged to have all its military forces out of the country by the
end of September.
   A central issue for negotiators in Paris is the future role of
the Khmer Rouge, who killed hundreds of thousands of people when
they ruled Cambodia from the end of the Indochina war in April 1975
until the Vietnamese invasion.
   Premier Hun Sen's government has rejected resistance demands that
the Khmer Rouge be included in a provisional coalition government.
   Cambodia's official news agency SPK said five-day international
conference on ``The Phenomenon of Genocide and the Prevention of the
Genocidal Pol Potists' Return to Power in Cambodia'' would begin
Wednesday in Phnom Penh.
   It said those expected to attend included Cambodians living
abroad and about 100 foreigners, including lawyers and academics.

   A Yugoslav minister told a conference
of evangelical Christians on Tuesday that efforts to spread their
faith have been hindered by the ``scandalous behavior'' of American
television preachers.
   Another speaker warned that TV preaching often fails to strike a
responsive chord among audiences in underdeveloped countries.
   During a speech to the conference, Peter Kuzmic, director of the
Biblijsko-Teolofski Institut in Osijek, Yugoslavia, said evangelists
must lead by example and that the integrity of their movement will
``enhance the Gospel'' or ``discredit and hinder it.''
   ``This is illustrated by the recent scandalous behavior and
related worldwide negative publicity of prominent American TV
evangelists and other evangelical leaders,'' Kuzmic said.
   ``These scandals show what the `cheap Gospel' related to dollars
_ rather than rooted in Christ _ does and how it links with the
sinful human nature,'' Kuzmic said.
   The Yugoslav did not mention names, but he appeared to be
referring to scandals involving American evangelists Jimmy Swaggart
and Jim Bakker.
   American evangelists have used television extensively to build
worldwide followings and multimillion-dollar corporate empires.
   But Philemon Choi, secretary-general of Breakthrough Ministries
of Hong Kong, said heavy use of satellite and television
communications, which only the rich can afford, may lead the
evangelical movement into ``the trap of insensitivity to culture.''
   ``While modern communication technology has its glamor and power
in terms of touching millions at a time, we should not forget that
in two-thirds of the world, many people still consider radio sets a
luxury,'' he said.
   Choi said the appeal of evangelical Christianity as presented by
TV preachers ``evaporates once the television is turned off.''
   ``We must remember that the tears of the TV evangelist is no
substitute for the weeping of the wounded, and the `electronic
church' is no substitute for the true Christian community life,'' he
added.
   The Lausanne II conference has brought together about 4,200
evangelical Christians from 191 countries to discuss ways to spread
their faith around the world.
   It was organized by the Lausanne Committee, chaired by the Rev.
Leighton Ford, a Canadian who lives in North Carolina. He is a
brother-in-law of Billy Graham, the famous American evangelist and
pioneer in television preaching.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `The Supreme ...' to CORRECT title of ruling

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle predicted the
Supreme Court's recent ruling on abortion will focus debate not on
whether abortions should be legal but under what circumstances they
should be performed.
   ``Most people in America support the right of a woman to have an
abortion,'' Quayle said Monday at a breakfast with reporters. ``But
that's not going to be the argument. ... The argument is going to
be, how are the abortions going to be performed in this country?''
   Quayle, on a California tour and campaign stop for Republican
Sen. Pete Wilson's gubernatorial bid, said he foresees such future
restrictions as parental consent required for minors, bans on
abortions in public hospitals and bans on abortions performed solely
because the fetus a woman is carrying is not the sex she wanted.
   The Supreme Court, ruling in Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services earlier this month, granted more authority to the states to
regulate abortions.
   Quayle, who said he personally favors abortion only if a woman's
life is in danger, said a so-called ``Human Life Amendment'' is
likely to be approved by Congress. Such a Constitutional amendment
would let states decide if abortions should be legal.
   Quayle said President Bush would support such a measure.
   Quayle's remarks drew criticism from those on both sides of the
issue.
   Democratic consultant Ann Lewis suggested the vice president was
trying to boost the Republican Party's appeal to voters who believe
women have a right to have abortions.
   Susan Carpenter-McMillan, the spokeswoman for the Los Angeles
chapter of Right to Life, responded, ``Read our lips. We will not
accept a change in the pro-life policy from the Bush
administration.''
   Later in the day, Quayle told the Western Governors' Association
meeting in Long Beach the nation needs to renew its enthusiasm for
the space program and chart a course for the future that includes
manned space exploration.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 members of the House have asked
President Bush not to meet with a prominent South African politician
unless that nation's white-minority government frees political
prisoners, lifts the state of emergency and allows dissident
political groups to form.
   The request was made in a letter dated June 29 and released at a
news conference Tuesday.
   One of the signers, Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., said he had seen
reports that Bush was considering meeting with F.W. de Klerk, leader
of South Africa's National Party, later this month.
   Wolpe is the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee
on Africa.
   The letter said that ``to meet with the National Party leader and
anticipated president of South Africa without any significant change
by the white-minority regime would send a terribly wrong signal
concerning the direction of U.S. policy during the Bush
administration.''
   The letter commended Bush for meeting with South African
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other opponents of the racial policies
of the South African government.
   As for Bush's meeting with de Klerk, congressmen said they
opposed such a session unless the South African government took
these steps:
   _Releasing all political prisoners jailed because of their
opposition to South Africa's racial policies.
   _Ending the state of emergency, extended into its fourth year
June 9, along with abolishing restrictions on leaders of
organizations outside parliament.
   _Removing bans on all political organizations.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, flying home from a
10-day trip to Europe, today said leaders in Poland and Hungary have
``too much hope'' for their economic and democratic reforms to fear
a Soviet backlash.
   ``I was struck by the tears I saw in almost every place,'' Bush
said of the thousands who greeted him on his four-nation journey
across both sides of the Iron Curtain.
   Earlier, bidding farewell to U.S. officials at the embassy in The
Hague, Bush said, ``I cannot think of a more exciting time in
post-war history.''
   Bush was flying back to a welcoming ceremony at the White House
with his full Cabinet, and planned to brief congressional leaders on
Wednesday about his 10-day trip.
   Bush, in an interview with reporters about the presidential
aircraft as it flew from Amsterdam to Washington, said the highpoint
of his 9,000-mile journey came in Hungary when he received a snippet
of the barbed wire recently torn down from that communist nation's
border with Austria and the West.
   The president also defended Vice President Dan Quayle against
renewed criticism of his campaign performance sparked by a new
political book. ``My judgment has been vindicated,'' said Bush. ``He
is serious. He is doing a first-class job.''
   The president said he had no information to confirm a New York
Times report that U.S. and Soviet negotiators had reached agreement
on key elements of a treaty banning chemical weapons.
   ``It would be a pleasant surprise,'' said Bush, adding that
verification ``is what has thwarted an agreement all along.''
   ``I'd like to see that in writing before I get euphoric about
it,'' he said.
   His chief of staff, John Sununu, and national security adviser
Brent Scwcroft also said they had no information on a chemical
treaty breakthrough.
   Asked the highlight of his journey, Bush cited the moment in
Budapest on Wednesday when Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth gave him a
plaque with barbed wire from the recently dismantled fence along its
western border.
   ``When Nemeth handed me that barbed wire _ that gets close to
it,'' he said.
   Recalling his reception from the crowds he encountered, Bush
remarked, ``I was struck by the tears I saw in almost every place.''
   But he said he was ``glad to be coming home. I think things are
going pretty well.''
   Asked if the Polish and Hungarian leaders feared a backlash from
the Kremlin if they go too far on their reforms, Bush said,
``They're not dwelling on that. There's too much hope, too much
optimism. It's still there, but it's overpowered by the moves going
on there.''
   Before Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands saw him off at the
airport, Bush met with Dutch opposition leader Wim Kok and other
parliamentary leaders for what he termed lively talks that at times
bordered on argument over environmental and other issues.
   ``Everybody wants the United States to pick up the check for
everything,'' Bush lamented. But he said, ``They understand we are
not rolling in money because of our deficit.''
   With stops in 12 countries under his belt since Jan. 20, Bush was
heading home from the first-ever visit to the Netherlands by an
American president after attending the seven-nation economic summit
in Paris and visiting Poland and Hungary.
   The highlight of his visit to the Netherlands was a speech Monday
at Pieterskerk, a medieval church in nearby Leiden where Bush
saluted moves toward political and economic reforms in Eastern
Europe, especially the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   ``And they know, as we do, that ultimately, whatever the odds,
freedom will succeed,'' Bush said.
   He said: ``We must work together toward the day when all of
Europe _ East and West _ is free of discord, free of division.''
   Compared with his predecessors, Bush has been a whirlwind of
motion, both internationally and domestically, since he came to
power.
   In his first six months as president, Ronald Reagan ventured
outside the country only once, to neighboring Canada.
   Jimmy Carter visited only two countries, England and Switzerland,
in his first six months.
   Bush, on the other hand, went to Canada three weeks after taking
power.
   He went to Tokyo in February for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito
and then made stops in China and South Korea.
   In May, Bush went to Italy, stopped in Brussels, Belgium, for a
NATO summit, and continued to West Germany and England.
   Bush also has been busy criss-crossing the United States. The
White House calculates he has visited 26 states since his
inauguration.
   And he won't be sitting still for long. Bush is expected to make
a two-day trip beginning July 28 to Chicago, Las Vegas and Tennessee.
   In eight years as Reagan's vice president, he toured almost 80
foreign nations.

<HEAD>Jackson, Moving to D.C., Sidesteps Questions About Race for Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson confirmed Tuesday that
he is moving his legal residence to Washington but again sidestepped
questions about whether he will run for mayor.
   Mobbed by reporters after his appearance before a congressional
subcommittee, Jackson, who made unsuccessful bids for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, said ``I'm not running for
mayor'' of Washington.
   However, when asked whether he would end all speculation by
saying unequivocally that he would not join the 1990 race for mayor,
Jackson said only that ``I will not bear the burden of your
frustration.''
   Pressed to explicitly state his plans, Jackson repeatedly changed
the topic from the mayor's race to the campaign for statehood for
the District of Columbia. He said he was moving to the city to press
for making the district a state and to work for other civil rights
causes.
   When asked if he was moving his legal residence here, he said,
``At some point we will.''
   Such a move, if it occurs at least a year before the Nov. 6,
1990, mayoral election, would make him eligible for the race.
   Mayor Marion Barry has held the office since 1979. Barry's aides
said last week that he was running for re-election and expected
Jackson to support him.
   Jackson has owned a house since 1984 in the northwest section of
the city, but has resided in Chicago where the Rainbow Coalition,
which he founded and still heads, has had its headquarters.
   The coalition is relocating to Washington, and Jackson said he
will be living here by Sept. 1. In order to become a legal resident,
he must change his voter registration or start paying city income
taxes.
   Jackson's house, which has been under renovation, is not ready to
be occupied. In the meantime, Jackson has made arrangements to rent
a three-bedroom apartment in the district.
   ``My opinion is that both the mayor and Jackson are engaged in a
holding pattern intended to keep other candidates for mayor off
balance and to keep the financial supporters of other candidates off
balance,'' said Charlene Drew-Jarvis, a member of the city council
who has said she will announce her candidacy for mayor soon.
   Jackson said it was too soon to be concentrating on the mayor's
race. ``The mayor has another year to serve,'' he said.
   ``Focus on the mayor's race is paralyzing the city,'' he said.
``The priority issue ought to be enfranchisement of the District of
Columbia.''
   Other announced mayoral candidates include David Clarke, the
council chairman; John Ray, a member of the council; and
businesswoman Sharon Pratt Dixon, a former Democratic National
Committee treasurer.
   Jackson was questioned by reporters after testifying in favor of
legislation to expand the rights of the disabled. His appearance was
before the House Committee on Education and Labor subcommittees on
select education and employment opportunities.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers and their allied militia
in south Lebanon shelled and intercepted a squad of guerrillas
Tuesday, killing one and wounding three, police reported.
   Police also said Syrian soldiers and the Christian army units of
Gen. Michel Aoun fought intermittent artillery duels in and around
Beirut. No casualties were reported.
   A police spokesman said an armored force of the South Lebanon
Army militia moved north from Israel's south Lebaon ``security
zone'' to intercept guerrillas ``encircled by Israeli shellfire.''
   He said the militiamen ``fought a one-hour confrontation with the
guerrillas'' about two miles north of the security zone, a strip
that varies in depth from six to 10 miles just inside south Lebanon.
   An Israeli ``observation post spotted the guerrilla squad north
of the zone before daybreak,'' the spokesman said. ``Israeli gunners
hammered the guerrillas with about 200 howitzer shells until shortly
after daybreak, when the SLA patrol was sent out of the zone to
intercept them.
   ``One guerrilla fighter was killed in the confrontation and three
others were wounded. SLA militiamen were seen carrying the dead
person into one of their T-54 tanks.''
   The wounded guerrillas managed to withdraw north to
Syrian-controlled territory in the Bekaa Valley, he said. No
casualties were reported among the militiamen
   Police did not identify the guerrilla group involved.
   Israel established the zone in June 1985, when it withdrew most
of its forces from south Lebanon after three years of occupation.
The South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia financed
and trained by Israel, helps patrol the zone.
   In the capital, Syria's 130mm howitzer batteries along the
seaside boulevard in west Beirut opened fire at 1 a.m. on the
Christian-held coast north of the city.
   Syrian gunners have shelled the coast since the artillery war
began March 8 in an attempt to keep supply ships from landing at
Christian ports.
   Shells landed around the ports of Jounieh and Byblos, causing
damage but no casualties, the police spokesman said.
   Jounieh and Byblos have been the main destinations for ships
bringing food and fuel to the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
north and east of Beirut, which the Syrians and allied Moslem forces
have under siege.
   Aoun's 155mm made howitzers bombarded the Syrian artillery
emplacements in west Beirut, police said.
   Artillery and rocket exchanges began two days after Aoun imposed
a land and sea blockade on illegal ports run by Moslem militias.
Druse militiamen responded with artillery fire and Syria soon joined
the Druse.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year after Lebanon's
sectarian civil war began. Aoun calls the Syrians an occupation army
and has sworn to drive them out.
   Because of a political crisis that arose last September, Lebanon
has two competing governments: a Christian one led by Aoun and a
Moslem Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Salim Hoss.

   Typhoon Gordon, which killed 26 people in the
Philippines and one woman in Hong Kong, weakened Tuesday night as it
headed west toward Guangxi province in southern China, the State
Meteorological Bureau said.
   The typhoon left nearly 186,000 people homeless in the
Philippines and caused $30 million in damage, according to the
Philippine Office of Civil Defense. Damage estimates from Hong Kong
and southern China were not yet available.
   China's Yangjiang and Wuchuan counties on the coast of Guangdong
province were hit hardest when the typhoon ripped through with winds
of up to 115 mph, said an official with the State Meteorological
Bureau.
   He said the island province of Hainan and western and central
Guangdong province also were affected, but he had no details.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said no information had
been received about deaths, injuries or damage.
   In Hong Kong, Gordon's winds ripped signs from buildings and blew
away scaffolding. All schools, courts and banks were closed, and
stock exchange trading was cut to just one hour in the afternoon.
More than 70 flights were delayed and several roads were blocked by
debris.
   A Hong Kong government statement said the body of a 68-year-old
woman was found in an inundated hut on outlying Lantau Island. It
said 31 people were injured, most by falling debris.
   Hong Kong's normally bustling streets were empty. Firefighters
evacuated families from low-lying areas because of flooding.
   In Macao, trees were uprooted, shops and streets were flooded and
cars were stranded in waist-deep water. Officials said flood damage
was extensive but there was no estimate on costs.
   One man was hit by a falling window and was hospitalized in
satisfactory condition.
   Five of Macao's six casinos closed Monday night but reopened
Tuesday after the typhoon swung away.
   In the Philippines, the Office of Civil Defense and Red Cross
said 26 people were killed, including eight children swept away by
floodwaters of the Amburayan River, near Bangar in La Union
province, 160 miles north of Manila.
   Eight people were reported missing.
   In Isabela and Cagayan provinces, officials said more than 1,500
families fled their homes to escape floodwaters and 1,400 homes were
destroyed. Crop damage in the two provinces was estimated at nearly
$20 million.
   Gordon was the strongest typhoon to strike Hong Kong and the
Philippines this year. It arrived in the Philippines early Sunday
with winds of up to 116 mph.

   Black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela says he will not be freed from prison this year, his wife,
Winnie, reported after a five-hour birthday visit today.
   ``His exact words were: `There will be no release, definitely not
this year,''' Mrs. Mandela told reporters outside the Victor Verster
prison farm north of Cape Town.
   The African National Congress leader, jailed for life for
plotting against white-minority rule, observed his 71st birthday
today with an unprecedented visit by 16 members of his family.
   His July 5 meeting with President P.W. Botha has sparked
speculation that the government might release him after September
parliamentary elections for whites, Indians and people of
mixed-race. The black majority of 28 million has no vote in national
affairs.
   Subsequent statements by spokesmen for Botha's National Party
suggested that the government was seeking a formula to free the ANC
leader as a prelude to possible white-black negotiations.
   Mrs. Mandela said that National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, who
is designated to succeed Botha as president after the elections was
``fully aware'' of the July 1 meeting. De Klerk has not commented on
it yet, and observers in South Africa had speculated that Botha,
facing forced retirement, took the action to upstage his successor.
   Mrs. Mandela said her husband's release has always been the last
item on his agenda. ``His own freedom is of no consequence. It is
the freedom of the people he went to prison for,'' she said.
   She said he had briefly touched on his meeting on Friday with
five African National Congress colleagues who were sentenced with
him in 1964 for founding and participating in activities of the
ANC's armed wing.
   She said he told her there was no specific significance to that
meeting but Mrs. Mandela added, ``Whatever Comrade Mandela does is
in full consultation with the leadership behind bars and the ANC
outside.''
   Mrs. Mandela and her daughter, Zindzi, wore black, underlining
the solemnity of the day that they had previously marked by fasting
and praying at home. Some relatives came from the United States, and
Mrs. Mandela said it was the first time Mandela's extended family
joined him since his arrest.
   Some family members wore symbols of the campaign for
black-majority rights.
   A grandson was draped in a vivid garland of roses and carnations
in yellow, black and red _ colors of the United Democratic Front,
South Africa's main anti-apartheid alliance before it was banned
last year.
   A son held up a fruit basket with ribbons in green, black and
yellow _ colors of the outlawed ANC guerrilla movement.
   About 20 supporters of Mandela shouted, ``Viva ANC!'' and, ``Viva
Mandela!'' as relatives arrived in five cars at the gates of the
prison farm. Mandela was transferred there from a Cape Town prison
after he recovered from tuberculosis last year.
   Well-wishers stood in the rain in near-freezing temperatures on
one of the coldest days in recent years.
   Mandela has been in prison since 1962, and he is serving a life
term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government.
   Mrs. Mandela said she brought birthday cards and greetings from
various anti-apartheid groups, including United Democratic Front
affiliates and the National Union of Mineworkers.

<HEAD>House of Commons Votes Against Divorced Clergy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Church of England's proposals to allow the
ordination of divorced men and of men married to divorced women were
defeated in the House of Commons on Tuesday.
   Lawmakers voted 51-45 to reject the proposals which had been
approved by the General Synod, the church's governing body, and by
the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament.
   Approval by both house of Parliament is needed for such measures
affecting the state church to become law.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the spiritual leader of
the Church of England and 70 millions Anglicans worldwide, supported
the proposals, hoping they would boost the declining number of
clergy.
   Runcie said the experience of a failed marriage could help others
facing a similar situation and called on Parliament to ``lay stress
on grace and forgiveness.''
   Conservative lawmaker Sir John Stokes told the House of Commons
he feared the proposals ``would send out a wrong or confusing signal
to ordinary people in England who are looking to the church and the
clergy to set high standards.''
   Debate on the proposals was delayed until early Tuesday by
several other items of parliamentary business the government wants
to clear up before the summer recess begins July 28. By then, many
of the 650 members of Parliament had gone home.
   Lord Hailsham, Britain's former chief legal officer, called the
vote ``unrepresentative and foolish.''
   ``You can't test a man's vocation to become a priest by a
majority in Parliament. It has to be done by the church
authorities,'' he said.
   The ban on ordination for remarried divorced men, or those whose
spouses have been divorced, has long been regarded as an anomaly in
the Church of England because ordained clergy can be divorced
without losing their posts.

<HEAD>Trade Gap Swells as America Brings in Record Imports</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Budget, Bjt</HEAD>

   The government said Tuesday the U.S. trade
deficit widened sharply to $10.24 billion in May as America brought
in record imports, sold less goods abroad and lost ground in its bid
to shrink the trade gap.
   May's imbalance was the biggest in five months and represented a
23.6 percent increase over the $8.29 billion deficit registered in
April, when the nation had its smallest monthly trade gap in more
than four years.
   Analysts predicted April's figure was the low point for the year,
and said May's increase dealt a blow to hopes that the U.S. trade
deficit would improve significantly this year.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the latest report
disappointing but said he was ``encouraged by the continuing
strength of exports,'' which declined slightly in May from a record
high in April.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the report was
``consistent with our expectation that the trade deficit will
continue to improve at a modest pace in 1989.''
   For the first five months of the year, the trade gap was running
at an annual rate of $111.1 billion, compared with an actual 1988
deficit of $118.53 billion. Last year's figure was a 22.1 percent
improvement over 1987.
   ``The trade deficit, over time and on average, is improving, but
only slowly,'' said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. ``We are
light years away from anything resembling balance in our trade.''
   The nation's best chance for trade improvement ``probably awaits
a significant turn for the worse in the U.S. economy,'' which would
cause American businesses and consumers to purchase fewer imports,
he said.
   In May, imports shot up 4.3 percent to a record $40.71 billion,
boosted by a big increase in America's foreign oil bill and stronger
spending on foreign agricultural products, capital goods, and
industrial supplies.
   Petroleum imports surged 17.3 percent to $4.75 billion as both
the price and volume of foreign oil purchases rose. The average
price for a barrel of oil rose for the sixth straight month and
reached $18.40 in May; the volume of oil imports rose for the second
straight month to 8.33 million barrels a day.
   Exports, meanwhile, dropped off 0.9 percent to $30.47 billion,
reflecting slower foreign demand for U.S. products in almost every
major catogory, led by a 5.7 percent drop in purchases of
American-made consumer goods.
   Analysts said exports are likely to decline further as the
strength of the U.S. dollar against other currencies increases the
price of American goods on foreign markets.
   Economist Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm,
said May's trade figure in part represented a bounceback from an
artificially low April deficit, but he predicted the monthly trade
figures are likely to gradually increase for the rest of the year.
   ``I wouldn't say this was just a fluke or that it's going to get
better again,'' Evans said. ``We are going to see pretty sluggish
exports this year, and that is the result of the higher dollar.''
   Bruce Steinberg, economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in
New York, said the United States might make some modest progress on
the trade gap later this year if the nation's slowing economy pulls
in fewer imports, but nothing like the $34 billion improvement
recorded in 1988.
   ``I would describe the trade environment as intractable,''
Steinberg said. ``It's difficult to get a lot more improvement than
we've seen.''
   The latest report showed increases in the U.S. trade imbalances
with most major trading partners.
   As usual, the United States posted its largest trade deficit in
May with Japan, a $4.28 billion shortfall that was up from $3.89
billion in April. The nation posted a small $78.3 million deficit
with Western Europe after registering surpluses in both March and
April.
   The imbalance with Canada, the largest U.S. trading partner, was
$739.3 million in May, up from $174.8 million in April. Other large
deficits in May were recorded with Taiwan, $1.09 billion; South
Korea, $503 million; and Mexico, $452 million.

   The superpowers have made some recent progress
toward a global treaty banning chemical weapons but the chief U.S.
negotiator in the talks today said ``there is no reason to be
euphoric.''
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the United
States and the Soviet Union have reached agreement on key elements
of a draft treaty that would ban the development, production,
possession and transfer of chemical weapons.
   Ambassador Max Friedersdorf, the head of the U.S. delegation to
the Geneva conference, told The Associated Press that some progress
was made in the latest round of U.S.-Soviet talks, ``but that's a
long way from completing a treaty.''
   Friedersdorf said the two sides agreed to a document on spot
inspections of chemical weapons sites, and the paper has been sent
to Washington for approval.
   But he called the issue ``just one aspect of the verification
problem,'' referring to the complex anti-cheating provisions widely
considered to be the most difficult issue in negotiations that began
more than 20 years ago.
   He also said agreement was reached earlier on a paper involving
exchange of data of the two superpopwers before the conclusion of a
treaty but that there were still ``fundamental differences'' on when
this information should be exchanged.
   ``Verification involves a lot more than the conduct of a
challenge inspection and bilateral data exchange,'' Friedersdorf
said. ''I dont think there is any reason to be euphoric.''
   The New York Times quoted a State Department official as saying
that the two sides had agreed in principle on ``a mathematical
formula'' prescribing the amounts and types of chemical weapons to
be destroyed over a 10-year period. But President Bush, national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft and White House chief of staff John
Sununu all said they had no information to confirm the Times' report.
   ``I'd like to see that (reported agreement) in writing before I
get euphoric about it,'' Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One en
route home from Europe this morning. `It would be a pleasant
surprise.''
   He said the problem of verifying compliance with the treaty ``is
what has thwarted an agreement all along.''
   The United States and the Soviet Union have the largest arsenals
of such weapons.
   The Geneva Protocol of 1925, adopted after poison gas in World
War I produced 1.3 million casualties, prohibits the use of chemical
weapons, but not their manufacture or stockpiling.
   Discussions on a chemical weapons treaty have been conducted on
and off in Geneva for eight years.
   The 40 members of the disarmament conferene include Iran, Egypt
and Morocco. Twenty-eight observers to the conference include Iraq,
Syria and Libya.
   Soviet authorities say they have no more than 55,000 tons of
chemical warfare agents, but Western intelligence agencies estimate
they might have as much as 300,000 tons.

   The contingent will be led by the flagship for the 6th Fleet in
the Mediterrean Sea, the cruiser USS Belknap, based in Gaeta, Italy.
   The Belknap will be accompanied by an Aegis cruiser, the USS
Thomas S. Gates, based in Norfolk, Va., and the frigate USS
Kauffman, based in Newport, R.I.
   On July 21-25, three Soviet warships will visit Norfolk, home of
the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
   They include the guided missile cruiser Marshall Ustinov, the
destroyer Otlichny and the oiler Genrikh Gasanov.
   Soviet warships last visited Boston in 1975.

   Frankfurt's Sachsenhausen
nightclub district wants to ban U.S. soldiers from enjoying its
hearty food, drink and revelry for at least six months because they
are too rowdy, the military said Tuesday.
   In a July 7 letter to U.S. officials, the Association of
Restaurateurs in the Sachsenhausen district complains about the
unruly conduct of the off-duty soldiers.
   ``The Association of Restaurateurs demands hereby that the
section of Old Sachsenhausen and adjoining access routes be declared
forbidden and off-limits for GIs of the American forces for a
minimum of six months,'' U.S. military community spokeswoman Ann
Adams quoted the letter as saying.
   Asked what the military had to say about the letter, Mrs. Adams
said: ``The response is still being worked out, but instructions
have been sent out to commanders at surrounding units to tell their
soldiers how to act downtown.''
   She said joint U.S. military and German police patrols are being
sent on weekends and paydays to Sachsenhausen, which is across the
Main river from Frankfurt's city center and is famous for its apple
cider and 200 restaurants and clubs.
   Normally, two military and two German police make up the patrols,
she said.
   There are more than 20,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in
Frankfurt and nearby areas, while the total number of American
troops in West Germany is about a quarter-million.
   The unofficial U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes carried
a front-page article Tuesday that included complaints from
restaurant and bar owners in Sachsenhausn about rowdy soldiers.
   ``I've had training grenades exploded in my place and tear gas
shot at guests,'' the newspaper quoted disco owner Harald Vogt as
saying.
   ``Why is it that every drug-high, drunk Ami thinks he has the
right to walk into any place he chooses dressed any way he
chooses?'' Vogt was quoted as saying. ``Ami'' is a German nickname
for an American.
   Disco operator Larry Grosskopf told the newspaper the Americans
are rude and bother other customers.
   ``They come in gangs. They're drunk before they get here and
raise hell when they arrive. They're foul-mouthed and molest the
women,'' he said.
   Stars and Stripes said Frankfurt's director of Licensing Office,
Malte Riechers, is against the ban.
   ``Impossible, unconstitutional and beyond implementation ...
that's all I'll say for the moment,'' Reichers told the newspaper.

   Leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party,
plagued by scandals and unpopular policies, gave bleak predictions
for this weekend's elections for the upper chamber of Parliament.
   Prime Minister Sosuke Uno, his image damaged by reports of a
relationship with a geisha, planned his first election appearances
outside the capital since the campaign began.
   ``I feel we hit bottom on Saturday,'' party Secretary-General
Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters. ``Since then, things have been
looking up ... but I can't say there has been a change in the
overall mood.''
   Hashimoto said Liberal Democratic candidates have been hurt by
public anger over the Recruit influence-buying scandal, which forced
Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, to resign June 2, and by a new
3 percent consumption tax, which the party backed.
   Hashimoto, the party's No. 2 leader after Uno, refused to comment
on public opinion polls and media forecasts that suggest his party
will suffer a major loss of seats in the 252-member upper chamber in
the election Sunday.
   But the mass-circulation Mainichi Shimbun newspaper Tuesday
quoted senior party member Michio Watanabe as predicting the party
will win only 37 of the 126 contested upper house seats, falling
short of the 54 it needs to win to maintain a majority.
   Watanabe reportedly said the party will be defeated in rural
areas, where moves to open up Japan's agricultural markets have
alienated farmers, traditionally an important source of the party's
support.
   The Liberal Democrats, who have dominated Japanese politics since
1955, hold 66 of the contested seats and 73 more which are not up
for re-election until 1992. The leading opposition Socialist Party
has 43 upper house seats, 11 of which are being contested.
   A serious setback at the polls could force Uno to resign,
although he has said he hopes to remain in office until his term as
party president expires Oct. 31. Due to the party's majorities in
both houses of Parliament, the party president concurrently serves
as prime minister.
   After Uno's return Tuesday from the Paris economic summit, party
officials said he is scheduled to travel to Osaka in western Japan
for his first election-related appearance outside Tokyo since the
upper house campaigns began July 5.
   Party leaders have distanced Uno from campaigns because of
reports he paid a geisha to be his mistress for several months in
1985. Uno has denied doing anything immoral.
   In Osaka, Uno will speak at a local university and travel to
nearby Kyoto for meetings with business leaders. On Thursday, he
will visit his home constituency in Saga prefecture, also in western
Japan.
   Uno's wife, Chiyo, will attend a Liberal Democratic women's rally
in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, on Wednesday, a local party
official said. Mrs. Uno has avoided comment on the geisha scandal,
but in one interview said she trusts her husband.
   Due to fears the sex scandal would cost votes, the party's Tokyo
chapter asked Uno to stay away from campaigns for the Tokyo
Metropolitan Assembly earlier this month. At one rally he did
attend, party supporters scuffled with women carrying
anti-prostitution placards and calling for him to resign.
   When campaigns for the upper house seats began, Uno gave only a
short speech in the parking lot of the party's Tokyo headquarters.
Before leaving for Paris, where he attended bicentennial ceremonies
of the French Revolution and the three-day summit meeting of major
industrialized countries, Uno made no campaign appearances and party
spokesmen said his future schedule had not been decided.
   In the Recruit Co. scandal, the publishing conglomerate sold
stock at cut-rate prices to politicians and bureaucrats it hoped to
influence. Stockholders made handsome profits after the stock went
public.

   Ballet superstar Rudolf Nureyev will make
his debut as a stage actor in a role that bears the indelible stamp
of Yul Brynner _ the monarch in ``The King and I.''
   Nureyev, who starred in the movies ``Valentino'' and ``Exposed,''

Aug. 18 in Syracuse, said tour director Arthur Storch.
   ``We have to find a fresh, 1989 way of looking at the show and
presenting it,'' Storch said of the choice of Nureyev. ``We must
give it vitality _ make it alive and exciting for current
audiences.''
   The 51-year-old dancer will work the production of the musical _
up to 25 weeks next year _ into his schedule as director of the
Paris Opera Ballet.
   Auditions are being held for Anna, the female lead in the Rodgers

<HEAD>Lawyer Defending KAL Disputes Finding of Probe of Flight 007</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney defending Korean Air Lines on
Tuesday disputed an international investigation of Flight 007 which
found the plane was significantly off course for hours before it was
destroyed by the Soviet Union.
   In opening statements in a civil jury trial, George Tompkins
refused to concede that the KAL jumbo jet was off track so early. It
was blown out of the sky over Soviet air space in 1983 by a
heat-seeking missile, killing all 269 people aboard.
   The best evidence is that the crew of the KAL jumbo jet was
flying its correct route until shortly before it was destroyed on
Sept. 1, 1983, Tompkins said.
   Tompkins said the crew sent radioed position reports periodically
to Anchorage, Alaska, and Tokyo pinpointing the plane's location as
being on course for the first four hours of its flight.
   U.S. air traffic controllers who tracked the earliest parts of
Flight 007 before it went out of radar range reported nothing
abnormal, Tompkins said.
   Families of 132 of the passengers killed when Flight 007 was
destroyed are suing KAL, alleging willful misconduct by the plane's
crew and seeking to collect in excess of a $75,000-per-passenger
limit in damages imposed under international treaty.
   The last radioed position report, in which the crew said it was
on course over the North Pacific, was about an hour before the plane
was shot down.
   What happened after that, only the Soviet Union can answer
because its radar tracked the KAL 747 and it was Soviet planes that
``shadowed'' the jumbo jet and destroyed it, said Tompkins.
   ``It certainly was willful misconduct on the part of the
Russians,'' the lawyer for KAL said.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization, which probed the
disaster, concluded that Flight 007 was off course for nearly 5{
hours and intruded into Soviet territory for several hours before it
was shot down with at least one heat-seeking missile from a Soviet
fighter plane. The report's conclusions were based on data from the
U.S. government, Japan and the Soviet Union.
   Tompkins labeled as ``theory, ... conjecture, speculation'' the
explanation offered by families of the dead passengers that the
plane's crew knew it was off course shortly after leaving Anchorage,
Alaska, due to an error in programming a computerized navigation
system aboard the craft.
   Tompkins said there was no proof of any programming error by the
crew.
   The three-member crew didn't want to turn back to correct the
problem because it would have had to dump much of the plane's fuel
and face disciplinary action, suggest lawyers for families of the
victims. Therefore, the crew may have sent incorrect position
reports and navigated without the use of the shipboard computer
system, the families' lawyers have suggested.
   Flight 007's crew ``literally ran four straight red lights'' by
being off course at various position checkpoints, Donald Madole, an
attorney for the families, told the jury.
   The plane was more than 300 miles off track when it was shot
down, said Milton Sincoff, who also represents the families.
   ``How could an airplane get 300 miles off course if they were
following procedures?'' asked Madole.
   Tompkins said that if the highly experienced crew aboard Flight
007 had made an error in programming the pilot's navigation system,
it would been aware of it immediately.
   Tompkins disputed the families' contention that the plane would
have had to return to Anchorage, Alaska, to correct the problem,
saying ``you can update it in the air.'' A crew member would simply
have to ``reach up'' and ``throw a switch'' to a second automatic
pilot and the plane ``would have turned and gone back on the
course,'' Tompkins said.
   KAL lawyers have asked U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson to
limit presentation of the conclusions of the ICAO report on the
shootdown. Robinson said he would decide as the trial progresses
what material from the report may be introduced. He said any
analysis from the report the families' lawyers want to present to
the jury must be buttressed by an adequate factual foundation.
   Numerous pieces of wreckage from Flight 007 were recovered in the
Sea of Japan in the days following the shootdown, but the cockpit
voice recorder and flight data recorder were never pulled up from
the submerged wreckage of the plane.

<HEAD>Residents Fighting To Save Depression-Era Phone System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH FORK, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Progress is about to claim another piece
of history, the state's last crank telephone system, and cut off 18
customers who live in the rugged Salmon River canyon from the
outside world.
   But the North Fork Telephone Corp. customers strung along 31
miles of the wilderness river in isolated central Idaho are not
going to give up without a struggle.
   ``I don't know what's going to become of it, but I know the
people are not going to take it lying down,'' store owner Donna
Myers said Tuesday. ``They're going to fight for it.''
   The system's party-line users of crank-operated telephones
running on batteries and magnetos are linked to the world beyond by
a single wire connected to insulators hanging from rocks, poles and
trees. Such systems were common in rural America decades ago but
only a few still operate.
   They can ring each other, but calls to and from the outside must
go through a local operator. On incoming calls, the operator alerts
the proper customer with a coded ring _ Mrs. Myers is three longs.
   But earlier this month, the North Fork customers were notified
that the operator will no longer be so handy.
   The operator service based in Salmon, 20 miles to the southeast
by air, is handled by the local exchange company, Century Telephone
Co., under contract to AT&amp;T. On Dec. 15, AT&amp;T is consolidating
operator services for the area to Salt Lake City.
   Computerized switching equipment that will handle long-distance
calls for Century Telephone customers can't handle a ``ring down''
system like the North Fork's. Placing calls through the Salt Lake
operator would run up long-distance charges.
   Century manager Frank Barsalou said there's no reason to keep on
an operator ``because all they'd do is handle the (canyon) calls.''
   North Fork customers could hire their own operator, but it would
cost more than $1,600 a week for round-the-clock service.
   A study is being made to see if service hours could be curtailed
and a switcher, someone less skilled than an operator, hired to
route calls in and out of the canyon.
   Canyon residents are accustomed to living without electricity and
only seasonal running water. But Marsha Smith said the phone
announcement ``hit us so unexpectedly. We've always been assured we
would have this service.''
   A letter-writing campaign to public and telephone industry
officials has been started in hopes of bringing attention to the
problem.
   ``This old phone, it might have its ups and downs, but by golly
it's been a life-saver in a lot of cases,'' said Mrs. Myers. ``We
have things from people who were hurt and needed ambulances to cars
breaking down.''
   The system, originally used by the U.S. Forest Service, was
bought by the resident cooperative in 1952 when the government
switched to radio communications.
   Because the Salmon is a wilderness river in that area west of
North Fork, the Forest Service will not allow installation of new
above-ground telephone lines, and burying the phone cable has been
estimated to cost $600,000.
   But, Barsalou said, ``They're really not interested in a modern
system. They want to keep their old crank phones.''
   ``We would much rather have this for a wilderness area,'' said
North Fork vice president John Booker.
   Idaho Public Utilities Commissioner Perry Swisher believes
service can be saved if everyone cooperates until a technological
answer is found.
   ``What's bothered me, personally, is that I haven't seen much
imagination by the telecommunication people in how to get down that
canyon with service,'' Swisher said.
   Mrs. Myers thinks a solution will take some time, but ``one way
or another they're going to work it out. They all know we need that
phone system.''

   The United Mine Workers and The Pittston Co.
agreed today to resume contract talks under supervision of a
mediator in an effort to end a bitter strike that has idled
thousands of coal miners in several states.
   UMW President Richard Trumka and Pittston Vice President Joseph
Farrell signed an agreement to hold negotiations Wednesday morning
for the first time since June 8.
   Under the agreement, a federal mediator will meet with each side
separately and deliver proposals to the other party.
   The agreement also said Pittston can continue to claim that talks
are at an impasse, and the union can still claim that Pittston has
failed to bargain in good faith.
   The agreement was a result of a four-hour meeting with U.S.
District Judge Glenn Williams.
   In the coal fields, more than 4,000 UMW miners failed to report
for work at Alabama's two largest coal companies today, a day after
they ended a four-week walkout. But a union official told them to go
back for tonight's shift.
   Trumka was joined at the meeting by UMW Vice President Cecil
Roberts, District 28 President Jackie Stump, and Judith Scott and
Michael Buckner from the union's headquarters in Washington.
   Joining Odom at the table was Joseph Farrell, vice president for
The Pittston Co., the coal group's parent company.
   The walkout at Pittston, one of the few coal companies not to
sign a UMW contract last year, led to unauthorized sympathy walkouts
beginning last month that affected up to 46,000 miners in 10 states.
   Most of those miners have since gone back to work, but wildcat
strikes still affect several thousand miners in West Virginia, and
two mining companies in Alabama reported that about 4,000 miners
failed to show up this morning. A union official told them to go
back for tonight's shift.
   Negotiations between the two sides broke down June 8. The
governors of Virginia and West Virginia had issued similar offers to
mediate talks, but Pittston officials had declined them.
   About 1,900 UMW members are striking Pittston in a dispute over
benefits and job security issues. The strike began April 5 in
Virginia and West Virginia before spreading to Kentucky. Hundreds of
miners have been arrested for a variety of violent incidents as well
as civil disobedience tactics.
   Federal statistics released Friday gave an indication of how
wildcat strikes that began June 12 are affecting coal production.
   The data showed that during the third week of the walkout, coal
production had dropped by 57 percent in the eastern half of the
country and 42 percent nationally, compared with pre-strike levels.
   Some miners in southern West Virginia remained on wildcat strikes
today, awaiting the outcome of today's meeting. Trumka last Friday
asked the wildcat strikers to return to work, and most appeared to
be doing so on Monday.
   ``It was time to come back,'' said Ron Airhart, president of UMW
Local 1412 at Keystone Coal Mining Corp in Indiana County, Pa.
   ``We made an important statement. We got the country's attention.
Now we'll get to work again and hope we've made a difference.''
   ``They have a full complement of people out there today and
everything seems to have started up very well,'' said Carl Heldt,
director of human resources for Old Ben Coal Co. in Oakland City,
Ind.
   ``They're in good spirits. I've been told by the mine management
that people seemed delighted and eager to be there. They've been
without paychecks for about a month.''
   In West Virginia, pickets continued to idle mines.
   ``There were pickets out there today, scattered all over the
highway,'' said Fred Jarrell, president of Local 1330 at
Consolidation Coal Co.'s Rowland Mine in Raleigh County, about 60
miles southeast of Charleston.
   ``I stood up there yesterday and preached for two hours telling
people to go back to work. I don't think it did any good.''
   Some scattered violence was reported Monday in southern West
Virginia, with coal trucks serving non-union Elk Run Coal Co. in
Boone County hit by rocks and other projectiles.
   Mark Polen, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association,
blamed a ``radical minority'' within the union for keeping the mines
idle, primarily in Charleston-based District 17, whose 8,000 working
members are among the most militant in the nation.
   ``District 17 is the root, as usual, of the problems,'' Polen
said.
   Some 200 Island Creek Coal Co. workers also were off the job in
western Kentucky on Monday evening, company spokeswoman Julie Accola
said. She did not immediately return a telephone call this morning
on whether they returned today.
   In Alabama, 4,000 miners failed to report for work at the state's
two largest coal companies, Jim Walter Resources and the Drummond
Co., just one day after they ended a four-week wildcat walkout,
company officials said today. Union officials declined to comment on
reports that the walkout stemmed from the firing of several miners.

<HEAD>Deaver, Citing $1 Million Legal Bill, Seeks to Reduce Fine to $25,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential aide Michael K. Deaver,
citing a $1 million legal bill, is seeking to reduce to $25,000 the
$100,000 fine he was ordered to pay for lying under oath about his
lobbying business.
   But the independent counsel who had sought a prison term for
Deaver suggested the former White House aide could pay the fine by
selling his family's home at a large profit.
   Independent counsel Whitney North Seymour said that the value of
Deaver's house has risen from its 1985 purchase price of $990,000 to
$1.45 million.
   ``Any reduction in the fine should be viewed against the
background of the leniency the court has already exercised toward
this defendant,'' Seymour said in response to the request Deaver
made last month.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who imposed the
$100,000 fine and ordered Deaver to perform 1,500 hours of community
service, has not ruled on the defense request.
   In their June 16 filing, defense lawyers said Deaver had not made
any payments on the fine because his expenses _ which include an
$8,250 monthly mortgage payment _ continue to exceed his income.
   Until he recently took a public relations job, which pays $6,500
a month, Deaver was ``without virtually any means of support for his
family other than borrowing money against his home to pay for
monthly living expenses,'' the defense said.
   Deaver, who was deputy White House chief of staff for President
Reagan until 1985, also has legal bills of more than $1 million
resulting from the investigation and prosecution that ruined his
lobbying business, the defense said.
   As a condition of probation, Jackson barred Deaver for lobbying
the government for profit for three years.
   Deaver, a close friend of the former president and his wife
Nancy, was convicted of three felony counts of lying to a House
subcommittee and a federal grand jury that investigated his lobbying
business for possible ethics-law violations.
   Seymour, who disclosed that federal probation officers suggested
that Deaver be sentenced up to 10 months in prison, said the former
lobbyist was ``in a better position to pay the fine than he was at
the time it was imposed.''
   ``Among other things, Deaver is now earning a healthy salary,
which was not true when this court imposed the sentence in question
here,'' Seymour said in his June 22 court filing.
   But the prosecutor said the appreciation of the value of Deaver's
house by $460,000 was ``the most significant disclosure'' in the
financial statement submitted to the judge.
   Deaver's share of the equity in his home ``more than doubled''
since his sentencing ``in an ammount more than sufficient to pay off
the fine in full,'' Seymour said.
   The defense said in a reply to Seymour's filing that ``it is
extremely doubtful that Mr. Deaver's home would bring anything near
its appraised value in today's real estate market, especially if he
was forced to sell.''
   Defense lawyers said ``Deaver's fine should be reduced to an
amount that, while substantial, can be paid without requiring him to
sell his home or go substantially further into debt.''
   Besides his outstanding legal fees, Deaver must pay the balance
of his $871,464 mortgage in three years, the defense said. His
monthly expenses are more than $12,000.
   The financial statement attached to Deaver's court filing did not
detail the earnings of his wife, Carolyn, who works as a real estate
agent.
   Deaver, who abandoned efforts to appeal his case earlier this
year, has begun counseling alcoholics at a downtown shelter for the
homeless.
   Under the terms of Jackson's order, Deaver, a recovering
alcoholic, will be required to spend nights and weekends at the
shelter. Deaver's work involves interviewing prospective patients
for the 25-bed clinic, leading Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and
counseling individuals.
   He is also helping a Georgetown University medical professor
devise a course to teach medical students to spot the symptoms of
alcoholism.
   Deaver declined through his attorney, Randall J. Turk, to discuss
his community service, saying publicity would jeopardize his
attempts to win the trust of the street alcoholics he is counseling.

   A federal judge says she will order a computer
hacker to spend a year in a rehabilitation center to treat what was
called his addiction to computer tampering.
   Kevin Mitnick, who authorities had described as too dangerous to
be allowed near a telephone alone for fear he might access
computers, will be placed in the custody of Gateways Hospital's
rehabilitation program, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer said
Monday.
   The judge said she will decide today whether Mitnick should also
be sentenced to prison. He was scheduled to be sentenced this
afternoon.
   Mitnick, 25, pleaded guilty in March to computer fraud and
possessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes.
   He previously was convicted of using unauthorized MCI long
distance codes to tap into computers at Leeds University in England
and the University of Southern California, and of causing million of
dollars in damage to a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.
   Both Harriet Rossetto, the rehabilitation program's director, and
Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said Mitnick's case was
the first they had heard of in which a person charged with computer
hacking had been treated as an addict.
   Ms. Rossetto testified that Mitnick has an ``impulse disorder,''
and would benefit from treatment. She said his illegal computer
activity gives him a sense of self-esteem he is otherwise lacking.
   ``This is a new and growing addiction,'' she said. ``There was no
greed involved. There was no sabotage involved.'
   ``It's something like climbing Mt. Everest,'' Asperger said. ``He
did it because it's there.''

<HEAD>Gingrich Arranging Legal Defense for Ethics Probe, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich is seeking
help from a former House colleague in mounting a legal defense to
the expected ethics committee investigation of his conduct, GOP
sources said Tuesday.
   The Georgia congressman has approached former Rep. Ed Bethune, an
Arkansas Republican with a law practice in Washington, the sources
said, speaking only on condition of anonymity. Bethune would not say
whether or not he had spoken with Gingrich.
   Gingrich, the second-ranking House Republican, answered ``yes''
when asked if he expected an investigation to cost him a lot of
money. But he declined further comment until the ethics committee
meets Thursday to decide whether to begin a preliminary
investigation.
   Gingrich, whose complaint helped lead to the committee
investigation that drove former Speaker Jim Wright from the House,
was himself accused last April of possibly violating House rules on
gifts and outside income as well as campaign-finance laws.
   The complaint, by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., focused on an
investment partnership formed by Gingrich and run by his wife to
promote a book they wrote along with a third writer.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel, of Illinois, said when asked
about Gingrich's plans on Tuesday, ``I heard he's thinking of
contacting former members. It gets to be a pretty expensive thing.''
   If the ethics panel, officially the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, begins a probe, it could hire an outside counsel
as it did in the case of Wright, who resigned as speaker and as a
member last June after the panel charged him with 69 rules
violations.
   The Chicago lawyer who conducted the Wright investigation didn't
dispute that he has discussed with the panel playing a similar role
in the Gingrich probe.
   ``I hear those rumors,'' Richard J. Phelan said. ``I wouldn't
deny the rumors.''
   He added, ``There's been a lot of discussion in Congress about
whether I would do it or not. We will have to leave that up to the
chairman (Julian Dixon, D-Calif.) or ranking member (John T. Myers,
R-Ind.).
   Ethics committee member Vic Fazio, D-Calif., asked about the
hiring of an outside counsel, said, ``There's obviously a lot of
inclination to go that route. There are people who think any time
you are dealing with a leadership position, outside counsel is
appropriate. On a personal level, I think an outside counsel is
appropriate, if it's determined there's a reason to investigate.''
   Rep. Alexander's complaint said Gingrich may have violated House
rules when 21 investors contributed $5,000 each to the ``COS Limited
Partnership,'' which was formed by Gingrich in 1984 to promote his
book, ``Window of Opportunity.''
   The complaint contends:
   _The investors' money could be construed as income to Gingrich,
in violation of limitations on House members' outside earnings.
   _The $105,000 raised could constitute a gift to Gingrich from
those with a direct interest in legislation. House rules prohibit
members from keeping gifts of more than $100 from anyone with such
an interest.
   _The money could be considered campaign contributions, subject to
reporting obligations and restrictions under campaign financing
laws. If so, Alexander said, the investment money may have exceeded
contribution limits and may not have been properly reported.
   Gingrich said in April that none of the investors received
``unusual or extraordinary personal help'' from him in their
dealings with the federal government. But the lawmaker acknowledged
that some of the investors had a direct interest in legislation and
that he had handled routine requests from some of them.
   The COS Limited Partnership was unusual because promotion of a
book is usually financed by the publisher. Gingrich has said he
believed the partnership could use a large publicity budget to give
him a best seller.
   Instead, sales of the book were modest and there were no profits
for investors, who got tax writeoffs instead.
   Gingrich's wife, Marianne, received a $10,000 payment for setting
up the organization, and later was given a 2 percent interest in the
partnership and a $1,500 payment for her work as general manager of
COS Limited, according to records released by the couple.

<HEAD>FmHA Preparing Collection Notices for Recent Defaulters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Collection notices are being prepared for a new
batch of Farmers Home Administration borrowers who missed paying
loan installments the first of the year, the agency said Tuesday.
   As of July 3, there were 15,704 newly delinquent borrowers.
Notices telling them to settle their debts or face foreclosure will
be mailed by early fall. Upon receipt, a delinquent borrower will
have 45 days to respond.
   Maryln Aycock, an FmHA spokesman, said the new wave of
delinquencies is in addition to more than 66,000 borrowers notified
last fall that they would have to provide certain financial and
production information to the agency if they wanted help in handling
their debts.
   If there is no response, or if a borrower is in such poor
financial shape that no alternative can be worked out, forced sale
or foreclosure proceedings are in order, the FmHA said.
   The procedure is specified by the Agricultural Credit Act of
1987, which requires FmHA collectors to tell delinquent borrowers of
various liberalized debt-servicing options available to the
borrowers.
   Aycock said the 15,704 newest delinquencies represent a sharp
reduction from more than 30,000 who missed the Jan. 1 deadline but
made their payments later.
   ``It will continue to go down as we get into the year,'' Aycock
said in an interview. ``By the time we get around to mailing (the
notices), I don't know what it'll be.''
   The FmHA, an agency of the Agriculture Department, is often
called the government's farm lender of last resort. Eligible
borrowers cannot qualify for loans from commercial lenders.
   When the first notices were mailed last fall, farmers had 45 days
in which to apply for loan assistance, which could include
reamortization or rescheduling, payment deferral, reduced interest
rates and, in some cases, debt forgiveness.
   The FmHA, in turn, had 60 days in which to review the
applications and decide on debt-relief options for the farmers.
   Delinquent borrowers submitted more than 35,000 applications, but
more than 31,000 who were notified last fall did not respond.
According to April 24 figures, the agency's most recent, more than
12,500 farmers had qualified for some kind of debt adjustment.
   The remainder of those applications received were still awaiting
FmHA action as of April 24, or had been returned incomplete. Some
had been settled by borrowers or were written off by the agency.
   In all, about $919 million of the estimated $8.8 billion in
delinquent loans were written off entirely or reduced under the
law's write-down provisions by April 24. Speculation has circulated
for months that FmHA eventually may write off or write down $2
billion or more.
   By state, as of July 3, here are the number of new delinquent
farmers who will be getting notices from the FmHA. The first column
includes the total number of farm borrowers and the second is the
number of delinquents, farmers whose payments are at least six
months past due.

   Nazi hunters who helped track down
suspected German war criminal Josef Schwammberger said Argentine
officials are taking too long to extradite him to West Germany.
   Schwammberger, 77, was one of the world's most-wanted suspected
war criminals before his arrest in Argentina in November 1987 on a
West German warrant.
   Prosecutors say he was responsible for the torture and murder of
thousands of people, mostly Jews, while commander of Nazi labor
camps during World War II.
   High-ranking officials from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles said they were worried that Schwammberger remains in
Argentina.
   ``The hard truth is, they have had ample time to deal with the
matter, and now we're getting worried,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier,
dean at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, on Monday.
   ``It's happened before that people have died in jail without
being brought to justice,'' Hier said in an interview at the Cologne
hotel where he was staying.
   Hier said he was informed by West German Justice Minister Hans
Engelhard on Monday that Argentina has told West Germany the
extradition hearings could take another year.
   ``This is an ominous development,'' Hier said. ``We think it's
necessary for the new Argentine government to immediately declare
itself on the Schwammberger case.''
   President Carlos Menem of Argentina succeeded Raul Alfonsin this
month.
   Hier also met in Bonn with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Hier said he asked the chancellor to contact Menem about
Schwammberger.
   ``The chancellor responded that he would look into this matter
and indicated there would be contact,'' Hier said.
   Simon Wiesenthal, the famous Austrian Nazi hunter, and colleagues
working for him had sought Schwammberger for years.
   In October 1987, the Simon Wiesenthal Center listed Schwammberger
as among the most-wanted Nazi war criminals still at large and
announced he was believed hiding in Argentina.
   The center's list appeared in Argentine newspapers, and Argentine
authorities were tipped off about his whereabouts.
   According to Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Los
Angeles center, the Wiesenthal organization has found about 50
witnesses in the United States, Canada, Israel and Britain who can
testify that Schwammberger was responsible for the murder of labor
camp inmates.
   Cooper said they included about a dozen former labor camp inmates
who saw Schwammberger personally carrying out inmate executions.
   ``To us the most important thing is putting Schwammberger on
trial for history,'' Hier said. ``To allow a person like this to sit
in jail in Argentina without a trial doesn't serve the record of
history.''

   Some say Seattlites drink more espresso than
water. In a city as wet as Seattle, that's saying a lot. For 10
years or so, the thick, rich brew has been found in department
stores, theater lobbies, ice cream shops, even at newsstands.
   Seattle has espresso bars lining downtown streets. Street vendors
hawk an aromatic cup the way hot dogs and pretzels are sold in
Manhattan.
   When it comes to coffee, Seattle is in a class by itself.
   ``People there don't realize how well off they are until they
travel,'' said Jerry Baldwin, owner of Peet's Coffee in Berkeley,
Calif., and co-founder of Starbucks Coffee in Seattle.
   ``Seattle is spoken of in reverent terms in the specialty coffee
industry now,'' said Baldwin.
   Dan Sampson, owner of a Danken's Ice Cream parlor near the
University of Washington, has watched as espresso shops ``just keep
opening up. It's unbelievable.''
   Sampson joined the craze. His store serves nearly a dozen kinds
of espresso drinks and specialty coffees.
   ``We put the machine in here because there's not any place in
town that people don't come in and ask for espresso,'' Sampson said.
``I would have been scared to open a place in Seattle without an
espresso machine.''
   At the Varsity Theater, the menu includes Milk Duds, popcorn and
espresso.
   ``You should see it in the wintertime. It's a madhouse in here,
all the espresso we make,'' Carol Texeira said from the ticket booth.
   Visitors sometimes don't know what to make of the drink, said
James Egan, who serves espresso from a cart on the Space Needle's
observation deck.
   ``The people from Montana and Wyoming want to know what it's
about, and I try to explain it to them, but then they usually don't
want to have anything to do with it. They say, `Give me a cup of
coffee.'''
   Originally a Middle Eastern drink, espresso was transported to
Italy, and from there all over the world. Today's version is brewed
in a special machine, where 200-degree water is pressured through
dark-roasted coffee beans that have been ground to a dust-like
consistency.
   The result is a concentrated, syrupy brew that can cost from 70
cents to $2 or more for an exotic drink.
   ``It's the best coffee in the world,'' said Kristen Barry,
sipping a tall espresso drink at Espresso Roma Cafe. ``I only hope
the rest of the United States catches on to espresso, because you
can't get it outside Seattle.''
   Barry said her favorite drink is an espresso variant called iced
chocolate almond latte. Seattle shops feature several varieties on
the latte theme, which in its most basic form is a shot of espresso
in a glass of steamed milk. The more familiar cappuccino is espresso
in foamed milk.
   From there the combinations are limited only by the server's
supplies and the drinker's imagination. Add nutmeg, mocha, lemon,
cinammon, raspberry, almond and on and on.
   To purists, such flavoring is fluff.
   ``The good places are the ones that will automatically put two
shots in. Ask for a double and you get three,'' said Angie Autio,
who drinks espresso along Seattle's Capitol Hill.
   Shoppers often browse with a cup in their hands. And espresso
carts are rarely more than a block away from any downtown office.
   Theories abound on why Seattle has become so coffee-conscious.
Baldwin said people in Seattle were receptive to new coffee tastes.
   ``They're not smug. Nobody ever thought Seattle was the be-all
and end-all of everything,'' he said. ``People in San Francisco and
New York have a tendency to think that they already have
everything.''
   Autio has her own theory.
   ``This place is very laid-back. There's not a lot to wake you
up,'' she said. ``Maybe if I were in New York I wouldn't need it,
but here I do.''

   A group calling itself the ``Blood-Bright Dare to
Die Squad'' says it will kill two Japanese each month because they
``collude with the ... dictatorial government'' of China, the
Japanese Embassy said Tuesday.
   A letter in Chinese mailed to the Japan Airlines office in
Beijing also said citizens of other countries would be killed if
they collaborated with the regime.
   Police continued rounding up participants in pro-democracy
protests that ended with the army crackdown June 3-4. Reports
Tuesday said journalist Dai Qing and Yang Wei, a recently freed
dissident linked to a Chinese group in New York, had been arrested.
   Ms. Dai, a reporter for the Guangming Daily, was a leader in a
democracy movement among intellectuals last fall. After students
took to the streets in April demanding reforms, she signed several
petitions to the government.
   Her husband, reached by telephone, said plainclothes police
arrived at their home during dinner Thursday and led her away. He
said he had not heard from her since.
   It was the first known arrest of a journalist involved in the
protests. Hundreds of journalists marched and signed petitions for
press freedom, and are said to be required now to write
self-criticisms.
   Xinhua, the official news agency, said Shanghai police arrested
Yang on Tuesday for allegedly ``conducting demagogical propaganda
for counterrevolutionary ends.'' Yang, 33, was jailed from 1987
until January on similar charges.
   While studying in the United States in 1985, he wrote articles
for a journal published by the China Alliance for Democracy, an
expatriate group seeking political reform.
   More than 2,060 arrests were reported in China in the first weeks
after the June 3-4 crackdown. Official reports of arrests have been
rare recently, but unofficial ones from families and friends
continue.
   Chinese sources say arrests have exceeded 2,000 in Beijing alone.
   A local official of Japan Airlines said the company had not
decided whether to take special security precautions because of the
letter received Monday.
   It said: ``Because the Japanese pirates collude with the
Communist Party dictatorial government and plot to launch a
large-scale economic invasion of China, from today we, the
Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad, enter into a state of war with the
Japanese pirates.'' it said.
   Two Japanese businessmen, tourists or people considered friends
of China's ruling party will be killed each month beginning Aug. 15,
the letter said. It made no specific demands, but said the killings
would increase next year to one a week if Japan did not ``repent.''
   ``Please tell other countries, if they collude with the
dictatorial government, they will meet the same fate,'' the letter
concluded.
   ``We don't know how serious this is,'' said Hideo Watanabe, first
secretary of the Japanese Embassy.
   The letter's tone and terminology suggested links to the student
movement. Students and supporters in many cities formed ``dare to
die squads'' during the pro-democracy campaign and there has been
speculation some would go underground.
   When dynamite exploded on a Shanghai-bound train June 26, killing
24 people, authorities said they suspected sabotage. Results of a
police investigation have not been released, but the government
later issued emergency orders for tighter security to stop ``the
enemy from blowing up and sabotaging railway facilities.''
   China has no known terrorist organizations. Acts of sabotage are
reported from time to time, but usually are attributed to
disgruntled individuals.
   Official controls and supervision extend to many aspects of daily
life, making it difficult for an underground organization to operate.
   Watanabe said about 1,000 Japanese are in Beijing, roughly half
the number living in the capital before political turmoil caused
many foreigners to leave.
   Some Japanese businessmen have returned, but express reservations
about future investment. Their government has halted high-level
contacts with China and frozen development aid.
   In the only other known case of a terrorist threat to foreigners,
authorities told the U.S. Embassy in June 1988 that nationals of a
third country planned to attack Americans in Beijing.
   China said several days later the danger had passed, but gave no
public explanation. The third country was not identified.

   Amnesty International is asking India to account
for three Sikh activists and four suspected criminals who are feared
by the human rights group to have been killed in police custody.
   The London-based group said witnesses reported the seven men were
taken away during police raids in April 1987 and January 1988.
   It said authorities at first acknowledged some of the detentions
but later denied them.
   In a report released Wednesday, Amnesty International called for
``speedy, impartial and independent investigations'' into these and
other disappearances. It also said police and security forces
implicated in such cases should be prosecuted.
   Indian courts have in rare cases held police or army officials
responsible for disappearances and ordered states to pay
compensation to relatives. However, no officials are known to have
been prosecuted or convicted in such cases, the report said.
   The three Sikhs, who were suspected of political violence in the
northern state of Punjab, disappeared in mid-January 1988 after
reportedly being arrested by plainclothes officers in Chandigarh and
Mohali, the report said.
   The government has tried to put down a movement of Sikh militants
who want a separate homeland. In June 1984, authorities raided the
Sikh Golden Temple at Amritsar, leaving 1,200 people dead.
   The report identified the three detained Sikhs as mechanic Manjit
Singh, electrician Jatinder Pal Singh and taxi driver Balwinder
Singh.
   It said fellow detainees, whose identities were not published,
claimed they saw the first two at Mayi Ki Sarai interrogation center
at the end of January 1988 and said the men had been severely
tortured, the report said.
   Another former detainee at the interrogation center said he saw
the third man, taxi driver Balwinder Singh, and said he also had
been tortured. No date was given for when he was reportedly seen.
   Amnesty International, which has been barred by Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi from visiting Punjab, says most cases of disappearances
in the state are difficult to verify. But it said the three cases in
the report ``were well-documented, sometimes by eyewitnesses.''
   The human rights group said the other missing men include truck
driver Puran Singh, described by police as a robber, and his
18-year-old assistant, Shyam Singh.
   They were last seen by relatives at an apartment in Nai Abadi in
the Hapur district of Uttar Pradesh on April 10, 1987, the report
said.
   Witnesses said the men were taken away by police officers of the
Lajpat Nagar station in New Delhi, apparently on suspicion of
robbery, according to the report. Police said they went to the
suspects' house but made no arrests.
   Two farmers, Veer Singh, and his cousin Tilak Ram, were reported
to disappear that same day in an apparently related police raid in
Baraundi, 30 miles away, the report said.
   ``There is strong evidence that (the four) have been killed,
either by shooting or following torture while in police custody, and
that staff of the South Delhi police have tried to cover up the
murder,'' the report said.

   Managua was a place of fear and confusion in the last days of
Anastasio Somoza's regime. It was a smoky, noisy, intensely
dangerous city with few safe havens.
   Smoldering tires and paving-stone barricades turned streets into
obstacle courses where ambushers might lurk. Looters smashed shop
windows. Renegade soldiers and guerrillas relieved the unarmed and
unwary of watches, wallets and jewelry.
   Bombs demolished restaurants. Teen-age snipers, some shorter than
their rifles, played hit-and-run with Somoza's army.
   White flags flew from automobile antennas. Drivers hoped that
would make them less of a target, but it seldom worked.
   Somoza's air force attacked guerrilla concentrations inside the
city _ strafing, rocketing, even rolling bombs out of helicopters.
   At Las Mercedes Airport east of the city, Somoza supporters and
their families tried desperately to get on departing flights. Somoza
stayed in his bunker.
   Reporting became especially difficult and dangerous in May 1979.
Sandinistas infiltrated the city. You never knew when you would run
into soldiers or guerrillas, or how they would react.
   Journalists, like combat troops, learned to gauge situations by
watching people in the street: Normal movement meant it was safe to
proceed; scurrying usually meant danger; if no one was about, the
area probably was in someone's field of fire.
   We learned to watch for flaring nostrils on soldiers or
guerrillas, a sign of extreme agitation that meant it was time to
leave, if you could.
   A chance encounter with irritable soldiers in Managua cost ABC-TV
correspondent Bill Stewart his life. Stewart and his interpreter, in
the country only a few days, were shot to death at an army
checkpoint.
   His crew recorded his death in dramatic television footage.
Stewart was forced to his knees, then made to lie face down in the
street. A corporal put the muzzle of his M-16 to the back of the
correspondent's head and blew it away.
   Soldiers realized their mistake when they opened Stewart's rented
van and saw the American film crew. A quick-witted Nicaraguan driver
saved their lives by suggesting to the soldiers that the murder be
blamed on Sandinistas.
   The body was put into the van and Stewart's crew returned to the
Intecontinental Hotel, just 200 yards from Somoza's bunker.
   In case the army came to seize the tapes, the ABC crew made
duplicates and passed them out to journalists in hopes at least one
would be smuggled out of the country.
   It was unnecessary. ABC transmited the tape to New York from
Sozoma's satellite ground station before Nicaraguan officials
realized what it contained.
   Stewart's death was shown across the world and hastened the end
of the Somoza regime. It also caused an evacuation of American
journalists.
   A U.S. Air Force C-130 arrived and took about 25 journalists,
most of them network television people, and some American dependents
to Panama. Those who remained had the curious, uncomfortable task of
reporting the evacuation of our colleagues.

   Israeli officials are increasing pressure on the
Bush administration to halt its dialogue with Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   As part of the campaign, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens on Tuesday
instructed more than 100 Israeli embassies and missions abroad to
distribute a report alleging the PLO had not abandoned terror.
   It was Arafat's pledge in December that cleared the way for the
dialogue with the United States, and Israeli officials hope they can
force an end to the dialogue by showing the PLO broke its word.
   The report, compiled by Israeli security officials, said Arafat's
Fatah faction had launched 70 anti-Israeli attacks this year, 10 of
which were carried out within Israel's pre-1967 borders.
   In an earlier report, the Foreign Ministry listed nine attempts
by PLO groups to cross Israel's northern border from Lebanon between
December and June.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Danny Naveh also noted ``a dramatic
increase'' in attacks on Palestinians by other Palestinians, saying
it coincided with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace initiative,
approved by the Cabinet on May 14.
   The proposal calls for Palestinian representatives to be elected
to negotiate interim autonomy for the occupied territories. The
final status of the areas would be determined in later talks.
   ``Right after the prime minister's initiative was launched there
was a dramatic increase in the murder of Arabs by Arabs,'' said
Naveh. ``We believe it is the result of PLO terrorism in Judea,
Samaria (West Bank) and the Gaza Strip.''
   As evidence, he noted the report said the number of Palestinians
killed by other Arabs rose from an average 1.6 per month in 1988 to
14 per month in June 1989.
   Arens told parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on
Monday that he had met recently with more than 10 Palestinians from
the West Bank and Gaza and all said they would not participate in
the elections plan for fear of reprisal from the PLO.
   ``Palestinian personalities with whom I met told me that anybody
who presents his candidacy for elections without PLO suport may find
himself dead in 24 hours,'' Arens told the committee.
   In a speech to U.S. fundraisers later in the day, Arens attacked
Western leaders for meeting PLO officials.
   ``Leaders of the Western world who meet with terror heads create
the perception with Palestinians on the ground (here) that they have
no choice but to surrender to the pressure and fear of PLO terror,''
said Arens.
   In support of the claim, the report said Palestinians carried out
1,403 assaults this year, 710 against Jews and the rest against
other Arabs.
   Since the start of the uprising in December 1987, it said a total
of 64 Palestinians have been killed and 243 wounded by other
Palestinians.
   By Associated Press count, 512 Palestinians have been killed by
Israelis, most of them shot to death by soldiers. The AP lists 82
Palestinians killed by other Palestinians since Dec. 8, 1987.
   Most of the victims have been described by Arab reporters and
residents as either collaborators with Israeli authorities or drug
dealers and prostitutes. Few of those attacked have been political
dissidents, according to Palestinian sources.
   With increasing pointedness, Israeli officials have urged U.S.
diplomats and visiting U.S. Jewish leaders to persuade the Bush
administration to abandon its dialogue with the PLO, which they
claim is undermining the election plan.
   ``The U.S. must decide whether to support the peace initiative
and its dialogue with the PLO. The two are mutually incompatible,''
Yossi Ben Aharon, the director-general of the prime ministry, said
earlier this week.
   ``The only chance for a dialogue can be through a dialogue with
the Arabs here and the PLO is an obstacle to that understanding.
There is no way to bridge that gap because we will never deliver the
Palestinian population to the PLO.''
   The Israeli campaign is likely to gain force following Tuesday's
death of Rita Levine, 39, of Philadelphia. She died of injuries
suffered in the July 6 Palestinian attack on an Israeli bus that
left 14 other people dead and 26 injured.
   Israeli officials hope their campaign will persuade a majority in
the U.S. Congress to order a halt to the dialogue. In response, Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has introduced legislation that would bar
U.S.-PLO talks unless President Bush certified participants had no
connection to acts of terror.
   But the campaign by right-wingers is undercut by liberals in the
coalition government who advocate direct dealings with the PLO and
argue that Israel is already conducting an indirect political
dialogue with the PLO .
   ``For months, clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have been
underway between the Israeli government headed by Yitzhak Shamir, vi
the Americans,'' said Deputy Finance Minister Yossi Beilin of the
Labor Party.

   Rapidly rising prescription drug prices may
soon affect health care for the elderly, members of the Senate
Special Committee on Aging said Tuesday.
   Steadily rising prescription prices have been driving up the
costs of Medicaid programs across the country and are a concern as
well for the Medicare program. Some lawmakers are concerned that the
Medicare drug benefit, which takes effect in 1991, may already be
underfunded.
   ``From 1981 through 1988, the prescription drug inflation rate of
88 percent dwarfed the general inflation rate of 28 percent,'' said
Sen. David Pryor, the committee chairman.
   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., said that ``soon many elderly will
be priced out of the market.''
   Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., worried that senior citizens ``are
already getting squeezed out'' and are not having their
prescriptions filled or are cutting their doses to make their drugs
last longer.
   ``Manufacturers claim they need exhorbitant prices in order to
pay for their research and development expenses,'' Pryor said. ``The
truth is, though, that the American public is footing much of the
bill'' for drug companies' research expenses.
   Pryor also released a report by the panel's Democratic staff
members showing that most of the new drugs pharmaceutical companies
put on the market are duplicates of drugs already being sold.
   That report found that 84 percent of the 348 new drugs brought to
market by the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies between 1981 and
1988 were judged by the Food and Drug Administration as providing
``little or no'' therapeutic potential to improve on existing drugs.
   The committee staff also said that hospitals and the Department
of Veterans Affairs get the best prices for prescription drugs,
sometimes paying several times less than prices charged by
pharmacies, where Medicaid and Medicare patients get most of their
medications.
   Winston Barton, secretary of the Kansas Department of Social and
Rehabilitation Services, said his state has kept Medicaid
prescription costs down with a bidding procedure. Under the program,
drug manufacturers bid for a contract that ensures the company
volume sales and the state discounted prices.
   But Barton said the program has met with significant resistance
from the pharmaceutical industry, because the discounts cut into
profits.
   ``The pharmaceutical companies are the only entity in the health
care field that do not pay their fair share in meeting the
health-care needs of the poor of this country,'' Barton testified.
   The Department of Veterans Affairs also negotiates for discounted
prices for drugs it distributes, but Dennis M. Styrsky, chief of the
department's pharmaceutical products division, said ``success is
unfortunately very limited'' because some drug companies won't
participate.
   Most of the drug companies asked to testify refused, Pryor said.
   Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, defended the industry, saying its share of the
health-care dollar dropped from more than 12 percent in 1965 to just
under 7 percent in 1987.
   Drug prices, he said, reflect extensive research and development
commitments, which have doubled every five years since 1970.
Mossinghoff said costs for labor, materials, product promotion and
taxes have also grown.
   Also, he said, companies have had to shorten the time during
which they recover their research expenses because of the surge in
generic-drug competition that comes when a brand-name drug patent
expires.

   Strikes shut down the railways, London subway, 37
ports, city libraries and day-care centers Tuesday, and even caused
Queen Elizabeth II to cancel a royal carriage procession for a
visiting Arab leader.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, trying to reduce
the 8 percent annual inflation rate, faces labor unrest from local
government employees, longshoremen, bus mechanics, ambulance crews
and others seeking seeking higher pay and other concessions.
   Two royal parks, Hyde Park and Regent's Park, were turned into
emergency parking lots for commuters suffering through the fifth
one-day railway and subway strike in five weeks. Trains and subways
carry nearly 5 million daily.
   Peak traffic periods started at 5:30 a.m. and midafternoon,
causing huge traffic jams on some routes.
   Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, president of the United Arab
Emirates, began a four-day state visit without the splendor of the
customary royal carriage procession to Buckingham Palace. The queen
called off the glittering procession because it would have closed
some of London's busiest roads.
   The sheik traveled from Heathrow Airport in a fleet of
limousines, battling heavy traffic, but arrived at the palace on
time.
   On Monday night, the 75,000-member National Union of Railwaymen
rejected a revised 8.8 percent raise offer from state-owned British
Rail. The 17,500-member Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers
and Firemen had accepted the offer, which was increased from 7
percent, earlier in the day.
   In the House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher castigated the socialist
Labor Party for not criticizing the striking rail workers. The
opposition party ``would rather inconvenience the consumer and
traveling public,'' she declared.
   Michael Meacher, the Labor spokesman on employment, said
government threats to ban strikes against essential public services
threatened ``fundamental democratic rights.''
   Rail workers are among Britain's lowest-paid industrial
employees. Average earnings, including overtime, are $471 a week for
drivers and $325 for others.
   The 10,500 striking London subway workers want a weekly raise of
$102 to operate subway trains without conductors. Management has
offered $48 plus extra vacation.
   Ports management said Tuesday a strike of 9,400 longshormen that
began at 60 ports July 10 was crumbling. Iain Dale, spokesman for
the National Association of Port Employers, said 23 of the ports
were operating normally.
   Dock workers are striking because the government abolished a
guaranteed-work plan in force at the 60 ports since 1947. Britain's
other 102 ports are not affected by the strike.
   More than 500,000 members of the National and Local Government
Officers Association began a three-day strike Tuesday, halting
municipal services that range from care for children and the elderly
to local tax offices, museums and libraries.
   Union leaders agreed Tuesday to informal talks tentatively set
for Thursday. The employees earn an average of $16,000 a year. They
want a 12 percent pay raise and have been offered 7 percent.

   Even in this day of runaway home prices,
Larry Austin can't give his house away.
   Austin wants the three-room bungalow off his lot to make room for
a new mobile home, so he put an ad in a local newspaper offering the
20-by-30-foot building free to anyone willing to have it moved.
   Five hundred people have called and at least 50 have looked at
the house in the outskirts of Augusta, but there have been no
takers, Austin said Tuesday. Perhaps its the estimated $2,500 moving
cost.
   ``Some people want me to move it, or pay them $1,000 to take
it,'' Austin said. ``I say `Jeezum, I'm giving it away.'''
   The house, which was built in the 1940s as part of a cedar
shingle mill, has been home to Austin, his wife, Tari, and their two
daughters for 10 years.
   Although it has a sagging roof and the floor is less than level,
Austin says it has new wiring and good plumbing. ``It was cozy, it
was warm, it was dry,'' he said.

   Ten pounds of chocolate chip cookies and
many persuasive letters later, Carolyn Goldston got her wish when
her 25th anniversary was mentioned in the nationally syndicated
comic strip ``Pogo.''
   Pogo and Porky Pine were shown in Monday's strip lying in their
boat discussing the hot weather. On the side of the boat are the
words ``A silver for the Goldstons.''
   Mrs. Goldston campaigned for several months to persuade ``Pogo''
writer Larry Doyle and artist Neal Sterneky to send a special
anniversary message to her husband.
   ``First she wrote a very funny letter, and said she'd send
cookies,'' Doyle seid. ``We asked what kind, and we proceeded to get
about 10 pounds of chocolate chip. Please tell her not to send any
more _ we're getting fat.''
   Mrs. Goldston said that in her letters to Doyle and artist Neal
Sterneky she used enough insider jokes and reference to show that
she was a dedicated fan. In fact being fans of the original ``Pogo''
strip helped draw the couple together in the 1960s, she said.
   ``I don't want anybody to think they can get on the boat by
that,'' Doyle said. ``This is the one time we put an anniversary on
the boat, and we won't be doing it again.''

   When a player goes under in this Monopoly game, it
doesn't necessarily mean he's lost.
   That's because the contestants are scuba divers taking part in a
marathon relay attempt to set a record for underwater Monopoly. The
game, being played in a cylindrical tank 10 feet deep and 10 feet in
diameter, is set to last 50 days, ending during the Jerry Lewis
telethon for muscular dystrophy on Labor Day.
   ``We'd played the game for 48 hours last November, and I thought
48 hours would be plenty for a world's record,'' said Bob Evans,
president of Venture Out, one of the Atlanta dive shops helping with
the record attempt. ``Then I found a dive club in Buffalo, N.Y., had
gone 48 days.''
   Volunteer divers must line up at least $50 in pledged donations
to join a game. They play on a weighted table, with the board
laminated to the top, and plastic-encased money and cards for Chance
and Community Chest.
   ``Physically, it's no problem at all, other than getting prune
fingers, and hungry,'' a slightly wobbly Rebecca Steele of Smyrna
said after a three-hour stint at the game board.

<HEAD>Iranian Ambassador Returns to France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iranian ambassador to France returned Tuesday,
the embassy said, five months after being recalled home during the
furor over the book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran's decision to send back Ambassador Ali Ahani was prompted by
French Ambassador Christian Graff's return to Tehran last month,
said Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus.
   The late Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urged on
Feb. 14 that British writer Salman Rushdie be killed for blaspheming
Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Two Iranian clerics
offered a $5.2 million bounty for his death.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community, along with Sweden and
Canada called home their ambassadors in protest and Iran retaliated
in kind.
   Iran later severed ties with Britain over the affair.
   Rushdie, an Indian-born writer, lives in hiding in Britain under
police protection.
   The Iranian news agency said Khomeini's decree had drawn
``worldwide support'' and ``the EC states had to eat humble pie and
quietly started sending back their envoys to Tehran; the last to do
so being West Germany and France.''
   Despite Khomeini's death June 3, Iran's new leadership has said
the decree against Rushdie still stands.
   The French edition of Rushdie's book goes on sale in bookstores
Wednesday and its Paris publisher said orders have been brisk.
   ``I am not publishing this book to reignite a religious war but
because a publisher must respect his obligations,'' said Christian
Bourgois, head of Editions Christian Bourgois publishing company.
   Of the 55 million people living in France, 2.5 million are Moslem.
   The novel was first published in English last year and the French
edition has been postponed several times. Bourgois said the delay
was in the translation, which was completed last month.
   ``Tens of thousands of copies have been ordered,'' Bourgois said,
without elaborating on how large the first printing was.
   The Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani, Paris-based spiritual leader of the
Shiite community in Europe, condemned the plans to issue the book.
   ``This book injures the feelings of millions of Moslems,'' he
told French TV. But he added he had also condemned Iran's death
sentence against Rushdie.

   The Bush administration lowered its forecast
for the economy on Tuesday and warned Congress to abide by its
budget blueprint or risk busting the $110 billion legal limit for
the fiscal 1990 federal deficit.
   But an uproar developed on Capitol Hill over an administration
plan to save $2.9 billion in fiscal 1990, opening Oct. 1, simply by
shifting a military payday from Oct. 1 to Sept. 29, the next-to-last
day of fiscal 1989.
   Congressional budget-writers complained that the Pentagon's shift
was encouraging House and Senate committees to claim deficit
reduction by bumping paydays of other agencies f
percent in 1990.
   ``The administration remains confident of the future course of
the U.S. economy,'' said Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's
Council of Economic Advisers.
   Each figure was more pessimistic than the administration had
forecast in February, estimates that at the time were called overly
rosy by congressional and many outside economists.
   Darman told the budget committee that the new projections were
``still a little on the optimistic side but achievable.''
   A slowing economy generally boosts the federal deficit because
goverment revenues drop, and its expenses increase from higher
interest payments and benefits paid to unemployed and poor people.
   But the administration forecast that if Congress enacts all the
savings included in the budget lawmakers passed in May, the deficit
would be $99.2 billion. That's even lower than the $99.4 billion
deficit forecast earlier this year.
   The gloomier economic assumptions were more than compensated for
by a $15 billion increase in 1990 tax collections over what was
expected in February, and $4.3 billion less in defense spending than
February's estimate, largely due to the payday shift.
   But the administration officials warned that Congress had little
room to avoid surpassing the $110 billion shortfall ceiling. If the
target is breached, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law would
trigger spending slashes in domestic and defense programs.
   ``There is very little room for slippage,'' Darman said.
   Congressional committees are still working on the spending, tax
and savings bills needed to actually implement the $1.17 trillion
budget for 1990.
   The administration also revised downward its projection for the
1989 deficit to $148.3 billion from $164.1 billion predicted in
February, mainly due to revenues running $13.2 billion higher than
anticipated.
   And the officials said that enactment of the savings in the 1990
budget would leave lawmakers facing an $88 billion deficit for
fiscal 1991 _ within $24 billion of the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman
target for that year.
   A storm brewed, however, over the Pentagon's pay-date shift.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the pay shift in May,
arguing that Oct. 1 will fall on a Sunday. He said moving the payday
for the monthly checks to the previous Friday would avoid
inconveniencing troops.
   Under a 1965 law that Darman said has been invoked seven times,
the defense secretary has the authority to move the payday.
   But lawmakers grumbled that the payday shift enabled Cheney to
claim a solution to a dispute between the administration and
Congress over the Pentagon's budget, in which congressional budget
officials were claiming that the military would spend too much money
next year.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., told
reporters that the administration ``can't foster the use of gimmicks
on the Department of Defense side of the ledger and not expect
similar treatment from Congress on the domestic side of the ledger.''
   The House Appropriations Committee on Monday approved a spending
bill in which $316 million in 1990 savings were claimed by shifting
a payday for NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Department of Veterans Affairs from October to September.
   Congressional budget officials estimate that if lawmakers shift
the paydays for all agencies, $5.5 billion would be claimed in
savings. Another $4.8 billion would be claimed as savings if federal
pension payments were bumped into September.
   Congressional leaders worked Monday and Tuesday to try to stem
the tide of committees shifting the paydays.
   At the budget panel hearing, Darman would not back down from the
Pentagon shift, but promised to oppose payday slippages by other
agencies.
   ``Our firm policy is no new pay shifts,'' he said, a play on
President Bush's ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge.

   One of 42 sled dogs from the International
Trans-Antarctica Expedition died of apparent heat stroke in Havana
after the air conditioning failed on the expedition's Soviet
airplane.
   The dog named Apak was found dead in his cargo box Monday as the
animals were being taken to a zoo for temporary keeping, expedition
spokeswoman Cathy Saypol said Tuesday. Apak, who died Monday was one
of six reserve pullers being taken as backups to the expedition's 36
first-string sled dogs.
   ``The other 41 dogs were moved to a zoo in Havana and are doing
fine,'' Saypol, who spoke with expedition organizer Will Steger,
said from her New York office.
   ``It's not a good way of starting,'' Steger, of Ely, Minn., told
a St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch reporter traveling with the
expedition. ``It's the worst thing that could happen outside of
losing a person. It's a shame for the dog, and it's a shame for the
expedition.''
   The expedition originally had planned only a brief refueling stop
in Havana before flying on to Lima, Peru, where the weather is
cooler. However, the plane was held over in Havana for work on the
same problems that delayed the flight's departure from
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport by five hours Sunday.
   The air conditioning broke down at the Havana airport and
handlers took the dogs to a cool spot at the zoo to escape humid
weather with a high temperature of 87 degrees.
   Steger and an international team of explorers plan to stop in
Peru, Argentina and Chile before finally landing in Antarctica to
start its seven-month, 4,000-mile trip across the bottom of the
world on Aug. 1.
   Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snow
tractors, but if it succeeds, this would be the first unmechanized
crossing.
   The team members are Steger, co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of
France, Soviet scientist Victor Boyarsky, Englishman Geoff Somers,
Keizo Funatsu of Japan, and Qin Dahe of China.

   Coal miners feel the government is making empty
promises and will contine an 8-day-old strike that has hampered
operations at scores of Soviet factories, a spokesman for Siberian
miners said Tuesday.
   The Soviet Union's worst labor trouble since the turmoil of the
1920s spread ``like a chain reaction'' to two more mines in the
Donetsk Coal Basin in the Ukraine, a strike leader said. The
official news agency Tass said 39 mines in region were closed.
   No new figures were available on the total number of strikers in
Donetsk and western Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin, the nation's main
coal-producing regions, but earlier reports put the figure at more
than 112,000.
   Tass said the strike had affected more than 160 coal, machinery,
electronics and light industrial businesses in western Siberia alone
and that lack of coal could cause ``a catastrophe'' at steel and
power plants.
   Government officials appealed on radio for Kuznetsk miners to
return to their jobs, but Tass acknowledged the effort might be
futile.
   ``Many of them are obviously irritated (and) have stopped
believing in the endless promises of local officials and central
agencies about improvements in work and living conditions,'' the
agency said.
   The Kremlin sent Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a Politburo member with
experience in industry and labor, to Kuznetsk to negotiate with the
miners.
   Valery Legachev, a spokesman for the regional strike committee in
Kuznetsk, said miners were continuing their walkout because Slyunkov
made ``only general statements'' in long meetings Monday and
Tuesday, not concrete proposals.
   Slyunkov, who leads a delegation of Communist Party and
government officials, also addressed 30,000 people Tuesday in the
main square of Prokopievsk, 2,100 miles east of Moscow.
   ``He promised to increase the area's regular food supplies by 20
to 30 percent, as well as soap and washing powder,'' then toured the
city to inspect living conditions, Legachev said.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, said Slyunkov promised higher
pay for night work, longer vacations and a doubling of the wholesale
price of coal to pay for the benefits.
   Tass said he gave partial support to demands that most businesses
in the region be allowed to sell some of their products outside the
control of central agencies and ruled out ``half-measures'' in
responding to the strikers.
   Officials have said agreements made with the Kuznetsk miners also
would apply to those at Donetsk in the Ukraine, 1,450 miles south of
Moscow.
   Legachev, the strike committee spokesman, said Slyunkov's
promises lacked substance and the miners would stay out until all
their demands were met.
   ``We are determined to go on with the strike because they
received no concrete documented response to their demands,'' he
said. ``There were only general statements.''
   Grimy miners in hard hats near a tent city in the Prokopievsk
square responded with a resounding, ``Nyet!'' when asked by a
television correspondent whether they were satisfied with Slyunkov's
offers.
   A striker interviewed on the nightly news program Vremya
predicted the money needed to pay for concessions would be taken
from the miners.
   Donetsk strike committee leader Vladimir Komissaruk reported the
spread of the strike there in a telephone interview from Makayevka.
Vremya showed miners marching in a column in the Donetsk Basin.
   Miners in the Ukranian coal fields demand 40 percent more pay for
night work, better living conditions, fixed days off and retirement
after 20 years of underground work. They also want the Coal Mining
Ministry to trim its bureaucracy.
   Tass said authorities agreed to the Donetsk demands for pay
bonuses and longer vacations. It also carried a report denying the
strike had spread to the third major coal region, Karaganda in
Kazakhstan.
   Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were put down by force
before Mikhail S. Gorbachev gained power in March 1985. Tass said a
draft law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts was being
rushed through the national legislature.
   It said the law would ``furnish a legal basis for a resolution of
labor conflicts,'' including the coal strike.

<HEAD>Two Sides Resume Talks In Pittston Coal Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUFFIELD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers union and The
Pittston Co. agreed Tuesday to resume contract talks under
supervision of federal mediators in an effort to end a long and
occasionally violent coalfield strike.
   ``You just had the 20th anniversary of man landing on the moon.
That was a small step, and this is just one small step,'' said
Michael Odom, president of Pittston Coal Group Inc., Pittston's
subsidiary.
   ``A step is better than no step at all,'' said UMW President
Richard Trumka.
   Talks will begin Wednesday, they agreed in a meeting called by a
federal judge. The two sides will meet in separate rooms at a
Duffield hotel with mediators shuttling proposals between them.
   About 1,900 UMW members are striking Pittston in a dispute over
benefits and job security. The strike began April 5 in Virginia and
West Virginia before spreading to Kentucky. Hundreds of miners have
been arrested for a variety of violent incidents as well as civil
disobedience tactics.
   The walkout at Pittston, one of the few coal companies that
didn't sign a national UMW contract last year, led to unauthorized
sympathy walkouts beginning last month that affected up to 46,000
miners in 10 states.
   Most of those miners have since gone back to work, but wildcat
strikes still affect several thousand miners in West Virginia, where
some shots were fired Tuesday. Union officials in Alabama told more
than 3,000 miners to return for Tuesday night's shift at two
companies after they failed to show up earlier in the day.
   Trumka said he would have preferred that the union and company
meet face-to-face, but he said anything is better than the stalemate
that began when previous talks with mediators collapsed in early
June.
   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams, who brought the two men
together for a four-hour meeting Tuesday, said Trumka requested that
the talks begin immediately. He said Odom insisted that the talks
begin in separate rooms.
   The two sides also disagreed on who will negotiate for the
company. Trumka said he is ``obviously disappointed'' that Pittston
Chairman Paul Douglas declined to participate in talks. Odom said
the company would not be pressured into changing negotiators.
   Trumka said he will attend only Wednesday's initial session and
UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts will head the union negotiating
team. ``The minute Paul Douglas indicates a desire to participate, I
will be there,'' Trumka said.
   Odom would not say who would represent the company.
   Trumka said he isn't sure if the agreement to resume talks will
prompt the strikers to return to work.
   Odom said the wildcat strikes showed that ``there's no comfort in
a national contract.''
   Negotiations between the two sides broke down June 8. The
governors of Virginia and West Virginia had issued similar offers to
mediate talks, but Pittston officials had declined them.

<TEXT>
   The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra will wait until
October to begin searching in earnest for a successor to maestro
Herbert von Karajan, and one critic suggested the process could take
years.
   Karajan, conductor of the philharmonic for 34 years, died Sunday
at 81.
   Klaus Geitel, a respected music critic living in West Berlin,
said other conductors could be tied up for years with long-term
contracts elsewhere.
   ``Sure, they could ask Riccardo Muti or someone else to take over
for Karajan,'' he said. ``But the big question is, could they
accept?''
   Muti conducts the Philadelphia Orchestra and Milan's La Scala.
   Bernd Gellermann, the Berlin Philharmonic's business director,
said the orchestra is now on summer break and won't even try in
earnest to find a replacement for Karajan until October.
   The Berlin Philharmonic is one of the world's most famous
orchestras. Its marriage to the celebrated Karajan reflected its
place in Germany's heritage of musical excellence and composing
geniuses like Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Sebastian Bach.
   Music fans suffered an initial shock in April when Karajan
announced he was ending his often stormy relationship with the
orchestra. They were buffeted a second time when Karajan died.
   He was buried Monday night in a small ceremony in his hometown
near Salzburg, Austria.
   Musicians, critics, and fans already were wondering who would
replace Karajan after he resigned as the orchestra's ``conductor for
life.''
   Orchestra musicians and administrators are highly secretive about
possible heirs, but they made it clear this week that only the best
conductors in the world are in the running.
   ``I could name nine or 10 people, but I won't,'' said Rudolph
Watzel, a double bass player in the Berlin orchestra for 21 years.
   The orchestra's members make recommendations for Karajan's
successor, so Watzel is in a position to know who the top candidates
are.
   Gellermann said Karajan will in any case be a hard act to follow.
``The successor will be taking over an enormous legacy,'' he said.
   He said Karajan's replacement will come from a group of
conductors who have already worked with the orchestra.
   West German music writers say the front-runners are guest
conductors who have been on Karajan's podium during his absences due
to illness or who have conducted the orchestra since he announced
his resignation. The orchestra may have to continue to rely on guest
conductors during the search for a permanent conductor.
   The Berliner Morgenpost newspaper said Tuesday that the likely
contenders to replace Karajan include Seiji Ozawa of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra; James Levine of the Metropolitan Opera in New
York; and Muti.
   All have lifted the baton in Karajan's place in recent months.
   Guest conductors are a venerable tradition at the 107-year-old
philharmonic. Such musical giants as Johannes Brahms, Antonin
Dvorak, Richard Strauss and Peter Tchaikovsky performed historic
concerts with the orchestra in its early years.
   Karajan's contemporaries have taken his place over the past few
years when he missed performances because of chronic back problems,
medical treatment and generally declining health.
   Karajan had not conducted the Berlin orchestra since Dec. 31,
1988.

   Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela
told his family during a five-hour birthday reunion Tuesday that he
won't be freed from prison this year, his wife said.
   ``His exact words were: `There will be no release, definitely not
this year,' '' Winnie Mandela said outside the Victor Verster prison
farm north of Cape Town, where the black African National Congress
leader is held.
   Some of the 16 members of Mandela's family who observed his 71st
birthday gave black power salutes as they walked out the prison
gates, where about 50 youths chanted ``Viva Mandela!'' and sang
songs in the intermittent rain and near-freezing cold.
   ``On his personal agenda his release will be the last item,''
Mrs. Mandela said. ``He wants freedom for his political views.''
   She said he had asked for more freedom to discuss political
matters with other leaders and wanted contact with black trade union
officials.
   ``Whatever Comrade Mandela does is in full consultation with the
leadership behind bars and the ANC outside,'' she said.
   It was the 26th birthday Mandela has spent behind bars since his
arrest Aug. 5, 1962, and the first one he has spent with his family.
He is serving a life prison term, imposed in 1964, for sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the government.
   Mandela's July 5 meeting with President P.W. Botha had sparked
widespread speculation the government might release him after Sept.
6 parliamentary elections, in which the black majority of 28 million
have no vote.
   Mrs. Mandela also said National Party leader F.W. de Klerk,
designated to succeed Botha after the elections, was ``fully aware
of the meeting.''
   Some South African observers had interpreted de Klerk's lack of
comment as a sign that Botha, facing forced retirement, may have
held the meeting to upstage his successor.
   The family gathering included Mandela's wife, two sisters, his
son, two daughters, eight grandchildren, a great-grandson and
daughter-in-law. They came from the United States, Swaziland, the
black township of Soweto near Johannesburg, and the Xhosa tribal
homeland where Mandela was born.
   Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, Mandela's daughter by his first marriage,
brought her three children to see her father, including her
4-year-old son Kweku who had never seen his grandfather.
   ``Although he stays in his own house he is still a prisoner and
we would like to see him free very soon,'' said Mrs. Mandela-Amuah,
who came from Massachusetts, where she is seeking a doctorate in
anthropology at Amherst College.
   ``He will be lonely, but he will be happy that he saw us all,''
she said. ``It will carry him through the rest of the year.''
   Mrs. Mandela said her husband told her there was no specific
significance to his meeting Friday with five African National
Congress colleagues who were sentenced with him in 1964 for founding
and participating in activities of the ANC's armed wing.

Federation economist said Tuesday.
   John K. Hosemann of Chicago said it is not enough to have sound
monetary, tax and trade policies and then ``have a regulatory
apparatus that is going in the opposite direction by jacking up the
U.S. cost of producing food and fiber.''
   Hosemann's remarks were in a speech prepared for a meeting of the
National Economists Club at the Brookings Institution.
   ``Cases in point, farmers have been whipsawed by consumer scares
about nitrates in bacon, salmonella in chicken and milk, to Alar in
apples,'' he said. ``All of these with little conclusive scientific
basis but costly to farmers nonetheless.''
   Hosemann said that each of the scares has ``fanned the fire''
that the U.S. food system is unsafe.
   ``To the extent that all of the hype over water and food purity
leads to restrictions on the production and resource decisions by
farmers, we are not likely to become a growth industry,'' he said.
   ``Right now,'' he added, ``decisions are being made in this town
about the next farm law that are very likely to increase the
farmers' cost of doing business. ``We do not have research to
respond to the simple question: Can U.S. farmers compete
internationally under alternative environmental restrictions on the
use of farm resources?''
   Hosemann said his views were personal and not the official views
of the federation.
   A new farm bill should keep the American farmer competitive in
the world market and avoid go-it-alone decisions for curbing
production, he said. The United States also should keep fighting the
European Economic Community and Japan for market access.
   Hosemann urged also that monetary, fiscal, trade and regulatory
policies be ``consistent with economic growth.''
   ``If I have a central message, it is that farming always has been
and always will be a lot more than the price of hogs,'' he said.

   The trial of a Puerto Rican
nationalist began Tuesday with the defendant saying he shot an FBI
agent to protect himself and his homeland.
   Filiberto Ojeda Rios, who took his own defense in federal court,
called the Aug. 30, 1985, FBI operation to arrest him an assault
``against a Puerto Rican home and against the Puerto Rican people.''
   However, he also said he acted in self-defense to save ``my life
and that of my wife.''
   He is charged with wounding Abelardo Alba, one of 15 FBI agents
who came to arrest him in Luquillo, Puerto Rico, for his suspected
role in a 1983 robbery of $7 million from a Wells Fargo depot in
Hartford, Conn.
   If convicted of the assault charge, he faces a maximum sentence
of 60 years in jail.
   Ojeda Rios, self-proclaimed head of the pro-independence,
clandestine Macheteros group, did not deny shooting the FBI agent
but said he was ``prudent and reasonable'' in doing so. He said the
FBI ``invaded his town with agents dressed like World War II
commandos.''
   Federal Prosecutor Daniel Lopez Romo said the federal officials
were clearly identified as FBI agents.
   Lopez Romo said the agents only shot two rounds when Ojeda Rios
raised his Uzi submachinegun to shoot. Ojeda Rios was not injured in
the exchange.
   Ojeda Rios protested to Judge Carmen Consuelo Vargas that federal
agents forced him to strip naked for a search just before the trial
began.
   The trial was expected to last at least two weeks.

<HEAD>NBC's All-Star Game First in Ratings As Fox Moves Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC's coverage of professional baseball's
All-Star Game topped the weekly Nielsen television ratings, and Fox
Broadcasting broke its viewing records to finish ahead of ABC on
Sunday night.
   The first-place game on NBC was closely followed by ABC's
``Roseanne,'' which was second for the week ending July 16. Both
were on Tuesday night but were in direct competition only in the
eastern United States.
   ``Roseanne'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years,'' both of which had
suffered the week before because of the Fourth of July, bounced back
into the Top 10.
   Fox was third in the ratings for Sunday night, coming in behind
NBC and CBS and surpassing one of the three major networks for an
entire night for the first time.
   Fox's ``Married ... With Children'' moved up to 23rd place and
``America's Most Wanted'' was 29th. Both shows had a 21 percent
share of the audience, the highest share level in Fox history.
   ``Totally Hidden Video,'' plagued by controversy and a lawsuit
after its record-breaking debut on Fox last week, fell from 21st to
34th place. Its rating, however, was off less than a point. Fox had
replaced several segments of the hidden camera show when it was
learned actors had been used. The network also fired the producer.
Allen Funt of ``Candid Camera'' filed suit on grounds that some of
the stunts were taken from his show.
   NBC posted its 56th week of domination of the prime-time ratings.
NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. chart with an average of 12.0.
CBS was second with 8.9 and ABC was third with 8.6.
   Ratings signify the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million
homes in the United States with television. The share is the
percentage of sets in use.
   Here is a list of the Top 10: NBC's All-Star Baseball Game; ABC's
``Roseanne;'' NBC's ``Cheers;'' NBC's ``A Different World;'' NBC's
``The Cosby Show;'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' and ABC's ``Wonder
Years,'' tied; NBC's ``Empty Nest;'' CBS' ``60 Minutes;'' and CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote.''
   ABC had the highest-rated evening news show with 8.8. CBS was
second with 8.6 and NBC was third with 7.9.
   Nearly all the Fox shows have moved up in the ratings, so that
only ``Cops in Russia'' and ``The Reporters'' placed in the overall
five lowest-rated shows.
   The lowest-rated show was NBC's ``Jim Henson Hour.'' The bottom
five among only the three major networks were: CBS' ``48 Hours,''
ABC's ``Incredible Sunday,'' CBS' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ABC's
``Have Faith'' and NBC's ``Jim Henson Hour.''

<HEAD>Progress on Banning Chemical Weapons Seen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union have reached
agreement on key issues for a chemical weapons ban, officials said
Tuesday, but they also said a global treaty is not at hand.
   Ambassador Max Friedersdorf, the head of the U.S. delegation to
the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, told The Associated Press
in Geneva that the superpowers made progress in the latest round of
talks, but ``that's a long way from completing a treaty.''
   Added Friedersdorf: ``I don't think there is any reason to be
euphoric.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said the two
nations, which have the world's largest arsenals of chemical
weapons, are holding bilateral discussions on technical issues
relating to a worldwide ban.
   Their recommendations will be given to the multinational
conference which has been meeting in Switzerland on and off for the
past eight years.
   Boucher said Russian and American negotiators have settled
differences on spot inspections of chemical weapons sites and on the
order in which weapons would be destroyed over a 10-year period,
once a treaty goes into effect.
   Negotiators have arrived at ``joint texts'' ready for review in
the two capitals on those issues, Boucher said. Friedersdorf said
the paper on inspections has already been sent to Washington for
review.
   ``While these discussions have been productive ... there have
been no major breakthroughs and much work remains to be done,''
Boucher said.
   The New York Times, which first reported progress on the talks,
quoted an unidentified State Department official as saying the two
sides have agreed in principle on a ``mathematical formula''
prescribing the amounts and types of chemical weapons to be
destroyed over a decade.
   The task of verifying compliance with the treaty is widely
considered the most difficult task facing negotiators.
   Inspections are part of verification, but Friedersdorf said,
``verification involves a lot more than the conduct of a challenge
inspection and bilateral data exchange.''
   President Bush, who has long supported a ban on chemical weapons,
told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way back from Europe that
verifying compliance ``is what has thwarted an agreement all along.''
   Bush said he had yet to see any draft agreements, but any
progress ``would be a pleasant surprise.''
   Officials said the superpowers have yet to resolve differences on
the exchange of data. Boucher said the two sides are discussing how
far in advance of a treaty agreement they should begin to provide
each other with information.
   The Geneva Protocol of 1925, adopted after poison gas in World
War I caused 1.3 million casualties, prohibits the use of chemical
weapons, but not their manufacture or stockpiling.
   The 40 members of the disarmament conference include Iran, and
the 28 observers include Iraq, Syria and Libya, all of which are
thought to have chemical weapons capabilities.
   For any treaty to be effective, Boucher said, a ``substantial
number, all the major players, would have to be part of this.''

   The Democratic-controlled Senate, reflecting
lingering political fallout from the Iran-Contra affair, voted
Tuesday to forbid a president from soliciting foreign or private
funds to carry out foreign policy activities prohibited by Congress.
   The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
passed 57 to 42. Moynihan said the aim was to bar government
officials from bending to pressure from superiors to conduct
activities outlawed by Congress.
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., voting on the losing side,
protested that the amendment ``is a clear, bald effort to usurp the
foreign policy prerogatives of the president of the United States in
a manner not allowed by the Constitution.'' He predicted that
President Bush will veto it.
   The provision, attached to pending legislation authorizing $4.6
billion in spending for the State Department and allied agencies,
would make violators subject to fines and jail terms of up to five
years.
   Testimony before the congressional Iran-Contra committees showed
that the Reagan administration had solicited millions of dollars
from American citizens, and from such nations as Saudi Arabia and
Brunei, to circumvent a congressional ban on direct U.S. aid to the
Contra rebels battling the Marxist government of Nicaragua.
   One-time presidential aide Oliver L. North testified that he had
helped arrange such unofficial assistance to the Contras.
   ``This amendment can be summed up in three words: `Obey the
law'!'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Mitchell noted that Helms contends the president is fully
empowered to pursue his policies by indirect means even when
Congress has outlawed a direct approach using U.S. government funds.
   ``The president of the United States is constrained by law just
as is any American citizen,'' Mitchell said in disagreement.
   ``This is a democracy, not a monarchy. The president is not a
king,'' he said.
   ``This is a modest, reasonable response to ensure there will be
compliance with law,'' Mitchell said. ``It will prevent officials of
the government from having to choose between loyalty to the
president and loyalty to the Constitution. This amendment says that
if the law prohibits an act, it is prohibited indirectly as well as
directly.''
   But Helms replied: ``The opposition to this amendment can be
summed up in three words: `Obey the Constitution'!''
   He said that Bush would be fully justified in vetoing the measure.
   Helms contended that in foreign policy issues Congress has the
power only of the purse, with the ability to cut off government
funds for a given activity. But Congress cannot bar a president from
pursuing foreign policy by other means, he said.
   Voting for the amendment were 53 Democrats and four Republicans.
One Democrat and 41 Republicans opposed it. One senator did not vote.

   Sandinista guerrillas were infiltrating Managua and their main
forces were only miles away.
   Anastasio Somoza had fled and those who had supported his
family's 42-year-old dynasty were desperate to do the same.
   The daily flight to Miami by the national airline Lanica, which
Somoza owned, was the only way out unless, like the departed
dictator, you had a private jet.
   Pandemonium reigned at Las Mercedes Airport. Hundreds of people
crowded around the airline counter, trying to get onto the daily
Boeing 707 flight to Miami.
   The discreet custom of slipping money to a Lanica employee for
preferential treatment had been cast aside along with normal
manners. People cursed, shouted, shoved and cried, waving handfuls
of dollars in the air to attract the attention of anyone who could
help.
   Standing quietly, apparently unworried and surrounded by more
suitcases than anyone else, was the president of Somoza's central
bank. He boarded the aircraft later, turning at the door with a wave
and slight smile to someone in the terminal.

<HEAD>Catholic Officials Say They're Disturbed by Jewish Protests</HEAD>

   Roman Catholic officials said Tuesday they
were disturbed by Jewish protests at a convent operated by Carmelite
nuns beside the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. They also
said the convent would be moved.
   But the officials, in their first response to the demonstrations,
did not say when the convent would be relocated as Jewish leaders
are demanding.
   In Rome, leaders of a Jewish group met with Vatican officials
Tuesday and asked that Pope John Paul II intervene in the dispute.
They said their request was refused.
   The group also met with the Polish ambassador to seek the Polish
government's aid in the dispute.
   Poland's official PAP news agency quoted Bronislaw Fidelus,
deputy to Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, as saying, ``The
Catholic community of the Krakow diocese is disturbed by the
incidents'' at the convent.
   ``It is difficult to accept that the two latest incidents were
led by a high official in the Jewish clergy,'' Fidelus said.
   On Friday, an American rabbi and six students held a five-hour
sit-in at the convent grounds. They said the protest ended when
convent workmen kicked and punched them and dragged them from the
grounds. No serious injuries were reported.
   The rabbi, Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute in New York,
returned with four students Sunday. That protest ended four hours
later without incident.
   In their remarks Tuesday, church officials did not mention
Friday's scuffle.
   A church statement, carried by PAP, said land had been purchased
for a religious center farther from the death camp.The relocation
would be in line with an agreement reached by 18 international
Catholic and Jewish leaders, but the statement did not way when the
move might begin.
   Fidelus said, ``In the center there will be room, both spiritual
and physical, for the Carmelite sisters, and for any other
initiatives which will together show the religious dimension of the
memory of the Auschwitz tragedy.''
   The agreed-upon date for moving the convent from a former Nazi
warehouse that is within feet of the Auschwitz guard towers passed
Feb. 22 without any action.
   Fidelus said work on the center was about to start on a tract in
the same town of Oswiecim but away from the grounds of Auschwitz.
   An estimated 4 million people, including 2.5 million Jews,
perished at the Auschwitz camp from 1940 to 1945. About 6 million
Jews were killed in the Nazi Holocaust.
   Many Jews consider the convent an affront to the memory of the
Jews who died in Auschwitz.
   In Rome, one of the Jewish leaders who met with Vatican officials
criticized elements in the Catholic church in Poland, a
predominantly Roman Catholic country.
   ``There are some elements in the church in Poland that don't want
to settle this problem,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier. ``What is at stake
is much more than a small issue, but the entire 40-year dialogue
between the church and the Jewish people. It cannot be looked upon
as a local matter.''
   The Jewish officials who went to Rome belong to the Los
Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, which focuses on Holocaust
issues.
   They said they had sought the help of the Polish-born pope in
moving the convent.
   ``They (Vatican officials) told us the pope has made the decision
to absent himself from deliberations and that the issue should be
settled by the church in Poland,'' said Hier, who serves as dean of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
   Hier and three other group leaders met with Monsignor Luigi
Gatti, an official in the Vatican Secretariat of State, and
Monsignor Gerard Daucourt of the Vatican's office for relations with
Jews.
   Vatican officials confirmed the meeting took place but released
no details.
   ``The meeting was basically very disappointing,'' Hier said. ``It
was very frustrating to learn that the one person who can settle the
problem _ the pope _is not involved by his own decision.''
   The Jewish officials also said they met Tuesday with Josef
Wiegacz, Poland's ambassador in Rome, and asked for the Polish
governement to press the church on the convent issue.
   The Polish Embassy made no immediate statement about the meeting.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, home after a 10-day trip to
Europe, said Tuesday he sensed the dawning of an age behind the Iron
Curtain in which ``freedom and democracy flourish for others as they
have for this great country of ours.''
   Returning to the White House, the president was cheered by
thousands, including members of his Cabinet and tourists pulled from
lines waiting to see the Executive Mansion.
   Visibly tired by his whirlwind trip _ four countries in 10 days _
Bush said he had found ``an enormous amount of excitement'' in
Poland and Hungary.
   He recounted some of the memories he will take from the trip:
   ``The open arms of the people of Poland. American flags waving in
the sqaure at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk. The faces of the people
who lined the streets greeting us with such joy. The thousands who
endured a driving downpour in Budapest to welcome us to Hungary. ...
   ``The warmth that Barbara and I felt as a reflection of the
warmth the people of Poland and Hungary feel for America snd for our
ideals.''
   His trip behind the Iron Curtain, Bush said, left him sensing
there is ``a new world within our reach, a world where the yearning
for freedom overcomes discord and confrontation, where freedom and
democracy flourish for others as they have for this great country of
ours.''
   Minutes later, meeting with Cabinet members in the Oval Office,
Bush extolled the achievements of the weekend Paris economic summit,
at which he helped to chart a campaign to preserve the global
environment.
   Flying back from Europe, Bush said earlier in the day that the
high point of his trip may have been the presentation to him by
Hungarian Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth of a plaque containing
fragments of a barbed wire fence that had stood between the
Communist nation and neutral Austria as probably the highlight of
his 9,000-mile trip.
   ``I think when Nemeth handed me that barbed wire gets pretty
close to it,'' Bush said to reporters traveling with him on Air
Force One.
   ``I love our country so much that when people express their love
of America by their tears, which we saw among some of the older
people in almost every place, that moved me a lot,'' he added.
   Or, he said, the high point may have been standing with Lech
Walesa, the leader of the Polish trade union Solidarity, at a
towering memorial to slain workers in Gdansk.
   ``There were so many wonderful things,'' Bush said.
   As for the future of moves toward democracy and free-market
economies in Hungary and Poland, Bush said he felt there was ``too
much hope, too much optimism'' for those movements to be quelched by
Moscow.
   In both countries, reform movements were crushed, in Hungary in
1956 and in Poland in 1970. But Bush said he did not think fear of
the Soviet Union or communism could reverse the trends underway now
in Poland and Hungary.
   ``They're not dwelling on that,'' Bush said of past Soviet moves.
``There's too much hope, too much optimism. It's (such a concern)
still there but it's overpowered by the moves going on there.''
   The closest thing to a hitch on the president's trip was a lively
discussion with Dutch parliamentarians at the U.S. Embassy in The
Hague before heading home. The meeting, which Bush said bordered on
an argument, dealt with the environment, arms control, East-West
relations and Western assistance to the Third World.
   Many in the Dutch opposition want their government and the United
States to take a more liberal stance on such matters.
   Bush was the first U.S. president to pay an official visit to The
Netherlands, which first established ties with America in 1782. He
received a warm welcome there, drawing cheering crowds of several
thousand people along his motorcade route.
   Referring to the quickening reform in Poland and Hungary, he told
some 250 workers at the U.S. Embassy in The Hague, ``I can't think
of a more exciting time in post-war history.''
   Bush also said he was troubled by a new book that suggests Vice
President Dan Quayle lacks the competence required by his job.
   ``This is the ugly side of politics,'' Bush said as he defended
Quayle's qualifications and his own judgment aboard Air Force One on
the flight home.
   The trip added to the image of Bush as a globetrotter, but he
said he did not have ``image-enhancement in mind'' by traveling
abroad. He said he had been concentrating on foreign affairs since
the early 1970s.
   ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``The respect for the United States
around the world, I think it's still very, very strong. Very
strong.''
   Bush will pass the six-month mark in office Thursday. Asked on
Air Force One how he feels about that semi-anniversary, the
president replied:
   ``You're asking me on a good day. Ask me tomorrow after we go
back and wrestle with some of these domestic problems.''
   In his first six months as president, Ronald Reagan ventured
outside the country only once, to neighboring Canada.
   Jimmy Carter visited only two countries, Britain and Switzerland,
in his first six months.
   Bush, on the other hand, went to Canada three weeks after taking
power.
   Barely a month in office, he flew to Asia for the funeral of
Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo and then stopped in China and South Korea.
   Late in May, Bush went to Italy, stopped in Brussels, Belgium for
a NATO summit, and traveled to West Germany and Britain.
   Aside from his foreign travel, Bush also has been busy
criss-crossing the United States. The White House says he has
visited 26 states since his inauguration.
   And he won't be sitting still for long. Bush is expected to make
a two-day trip beginning July 28 to Chicago, Las Vegas and Tennessee.

   Vegetable farmers have boosted the acreage of
major crops for processing sharply this summer but have cut back
slightly on those grown for fresh market sales, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   The planted acreage for five major processing crops was estimated
at 1.52 million acres, up 14 percent from last year when drought
reduced the harvest.
   Cucumber acreage for pickles was reported up 15 percent from
1988, while green peas were said to be up 12 percent. Increases were
also reported for snap beans, 22 percent; sweet corn, 8 percent; and
tomatoes, 14 percent.
   Fresh market plantings for harvest this summer included broccoli,
unchanged from last year; carrots, up 6 percent; cauliflower, down 3
percent; celery, down fractionally; sweet corn, down 1 percent;
lettuce, down 2 percent; and tomatoes, down 2 percent.

   Senators and legal scholars argued Tuesday over
whether a constitutional amendment was political ``patronizing'' or
the best American way to overcome a Supreme Court decision allowing
flag burning.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., introduced the
constitutional amendment supported by President Bush and belittled
the idea, championed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden,
D-Del., that the way to overcome the decision was a simple statute
satisfying the court's concerns about free speech rights.
   ``There is no guarantee that the Biden bill will
`constitutionalize' the federal flag desecration statute. ... We
will have to wait perhaps three to five years for the courts to put
their stamp of approval or rejection on the statute. That's simply
too long for the American people to wait,'' Dole said.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., ranking Republican on the Judiciary
committee, said he thought a constitutional amendment was ``the only
sound and safe way'' to protect the flag.
   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honor
winner, said lawmakers were jumping too quickly to push
flag-protection legislation in order to gain political capital.
   Kerrey said that while he was ``outraged by the decision,'' he
has come to believe there was no necessity to pass new legislation.
Reading the decision, ``I was suprised to discover... (it was)
reasonable, understandable and consistent with those values which I
believe have made America so wonderful.''
   And the dissenting opinion of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, he
said, might impose a ``functional litmus test of loyalty before
expression is permitted.''
   ``Today, I declare that I don't support any of the constitutional
amendments which are being offered by my colleagues,'' he said,
adding that even passage of new anti-flag burning statutes might be
``more patronizing than necessary.''
   Kerrey said the constitutional amendments ``create problems
rather than solving them, and Harvard University law professor
Laurence Tribe delivered a similar message to the House subcommittee
on constitutional law.
   ``There are many patriotic Americans who believe that the
toughest but best way to show respect for the flag _ to show why we
are so different from those in Beijing who massacre protesters _ is
to protect even the freedom of those who would desecrate this symbol
of our freedom,'' he said.
   Tribe said that could be accomplished through a statute like
Biden's, which would make it a federal crime, punishable by a fine
of up to $1,000 and a year's imprisonment _ or both _ for someone to
knowingly deface the flag.
   The statute would remove all references in the existing federal
flag burning statute to ``ideas communicated'' in the process of
flag desecration and would punish only the physical act itself.
   The Supreme Court held in its 5-4 ruling in the Texas case that
desecrating the flag was protected under the Constitution's First
Amendment guarantee of free speech insofar as the act of destroying
the flag amounted to communicating a political point of view.
   Tribe urged the lawmakers to ``count votes'' on the Supreme Court
like they do in Congress, assuring them that changing a properly
drafted statute would win over a majority of the Court and as many
as seven justices.
   ``I submit that's the response that best protects the flag,'' he
said, without running the risk that an amendment could ``rip the
heart out of the First Amendment.
   Walter Dellinger of Duke University urged Congress not to touch
the Constitution because of the Texas flag-burning case of Gregory
Johnson.
   Johnson ``will have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of his
fetid imagination'' if Congress reacts so strongly.
   ``He will have succeeded in making the greatest nation on earth,
if we give him this amendment, look just a little silly, a little
less brave and a little less free,'' he said.
   But Republicans on the subcommittee expressed increasing
impatience with those resisting a constitutional amendment.
   ``What's the reticence about amending the U.S. Constitution?''
asked Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif. ``In my opinion, the flag is
not a light or idle cause.''
   Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., criticized ``all this hoopla about we
shouldn't amend the constitution'' when, he said, the court itself
regularly amended it.
   Paul Kamenar of the Washington Legal Foundation, said he believed
the court ruled incorrectly but now a constitutional amendment was
the only way to proceed. He said that could be done without hurting
First Amendment rights.
   ``The proposed amendment, properly understood, is not an
amendment to the first amendment but merely overturns the court's
judicial amendment to the constitution,'' he said. It would simply
put ``the law back where it was the day before the decision was
rendered.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., plans to bring to the
full House an anti-flag-burning statute, possibly before the August
recess, but has not scheduled any action on a constitutional
amendment. In the Senate, Majority Leader George Mitchell has
scheduled action in October on both approaches.

   Drought took a toll of soybean quality last
year, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The department's Federal Grain Inspection Service said in an
annual report that only 14 percent of the 1988 soybeans sampled
graded U.S. No. 1, compared with 20 percent in 1987.
   Split beans, damaged kernels and foreign material also were up
significantly, the report said. The agency based its findings on a
survey of 5,449 random samples of last year's soybean crop.

   Attorney Ervin Lee has been known to accept
chickens from financially strapped farmers as payment for his advice.
   In exchange for taking the reduced payment, Lee, of Minot, gets
free legal research and information from the state's Farm Law
Project.
   ``Cash is always better,'' Lee said this week. ``(But) if people
can afford to pay whatever, I believe that's what's important.''
   Two agencies, North Dakota Legal Services and Legal Assistance of
North Dakota, founded the Farm Law Project in 1985 to provide free
resources for lawyers who agree to represent North Dakota farmers at
reduced rates.
   ``Until recently, very few attorneys concentrated on agricultural
law,'' said Jason Coffel, a spokesman for the project. ``But now,
since last year's drought and the falling-out of the agriculture
economy, it's become a necessity.''
   Jim Fitzsimmons, director of North Dakota Legal Services, said
the project helped both poor farmers who need legal advice and
attorneys who have questions about farm law.
   ``A lot of farmers don't go to lawyers,'' he said. ``What we're
trying to do is generate a body of attorneys who will work with farm
clients.''
   Under the Farm Law Project, Minot attorney Paul Temanson conducts
background research for cases and provides up-to-date information on
farm-related law through newsletters and public forums. He also
works directly on some cases.
   Attorneys who use the service reduce their fees however they see
fit, Fitzsimmons said, adding, ``Sometimes it's unbelievable; they
don't charge a thing.''
   One of the Farm Law Project's more notable cases is a 1987
lawsuit against the Farmers Home Administration that contests the
agency's practice of confiscating government crop subsidy payments
of some farmers who are in debt to the agency. While a ruling is
pending, there has been a nationwide moratorium on such
confiscations.
   The Farm Law Project is unique to North Dakota and assists as
many as 350 attorneys each year, Fitzsimmons said. He had no precise
figures on the number of farmers who benefit from the information.
   Comments about the project have been generally positive,
Fitzsimmons said. ``Attorneys I've heard from say, `Don't let this
thing go,''' he said.
   ``It's important to have somebody watching one specific area and
making that information readily available,'' Lee said.
   Coffel said the project, which is financed by private grants,
costs between $35,000 and $42,000 a year. Two grants expire Sept. 1,
but a $7,500 emergency grant from the Otto Bremer Foundation of St.
Paul, Minn., should carry the project through the end of the year,
he said.
   Despite the project's tight finances right now, Coffel said he
was not too worried about obtaining grant money for 1990.
   ``I'm confident about the program,'' he said. ``I have every
reason to believe it's going to be up and running again next year.''

   The nation's high rate of infant deaths could
be cut, along with million of dollars spent to care for premature
babies, with a community-based program of home visitors, said a
report Tuesday by a government commission.
   The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality envisions a
system based on those used extensively in other countries in which
health visitors visit pregnant women in their homes to instruct them
in good prenatal care and offer support services, such as driving
them to doctor's appointments.
   The cost of a ``resource mother'' could be as low as $100 per
pregnancy, compared with $30,000 and more to care for a baby born
prematurely _ and $400,000 and more in that child's lifetime for
medical care and special services, said former Sen. Lawton Chiles,
D-Fla., chairman of the commission.
   ``We are currently operating under a misguided principle _ we
have developed the best medicine in the world to care for babies
born too early and too small,'' Chiles said in a statement
accompanying the report.
   ``Home health visitors would let us work at the front end to
prevent these babies from being born at risk,'' he said.
   An estimated one-third of all pregnant women receive inadequate
prenatal care, the commission said. In 1986, more than 70,000
pregnant women received no prenatal care at all.
   Inadequate pre-natal care is linked to high rates of infant
deaths and low birthweight babies, who are 40 times more likely to
die in their first month of life and two to three times more likely
to develop chronic, handicapping conditions, the commission said.
   A House measure includes about $14 million in fiscal 1990 for
development of new home visiting programs and support for existing
programs. Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said he plans to offer an
amendment that would earmark $15 million to $20 million for home
visiting programs.
   Under a home visiting program, women in a community would be
trained and paid a minimum wage to go to the homes of pregnant teens
and women in their community and instruct them on the importance of
prenatal care _ including good nutrition and quitting smoking and
drug use.
   Such programs are used extensively in European countries, all of
which have lower infant mortality rates than the United States,
which ranks 19th among industrialized nations in the world, the
commission said.
   An estimated 4,500 home visiting programs are operating in the
United States, many funded by churches and community organizations.

   Barbara Bush concluded a 10-day trip to Europe
on Tuesday marveling about the newly renovated palace where she
stayed in the Netherlands but saying she wasn't impressed by a
massive military parade she watched in Paris.
   ``I'm not crazy about military parades,'' she confessed. ``Once
you've seen one tank, you've seen them all and 200 is too many.''
   She said her remarks probably would get her in trouble but
insisted that the tanks ``all looked alike.''
   Mrs. Bush discussed the trip to Poland, Hungary, Paris and the
Netherlands in an airborne interview on Air Force One on the flight
home from Amsterdam.
   Last Thursday, France rolled out tanks, armored personnel
carriers and other examples of military muscle in a parade that was
part of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Bastille Day,
marking the beginning of the French Revolution.
   On Friday, there was a Bastille Day parade of marching bands,
extraordinary floats and other attractions, including opera star
Jessye Norman singing the French national anthem.
   Clearly, Mrs. Bush preferred the second one.
   ``Actually, one bursts with pride over Jessye Norman. It makes
you want to, you know, rev up those missiles and run out and fight
for France,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   The first lady said she really enjoyed the last stop in the
Netherlands, where she and President Bush stayed at Nordeinde
Palace, the pale yellow, newly renovated ``working palace'' used for
official functions and government offices.
   ``We slept in a sleigh bed last night with an enormous'' wood
frame, she said.
   ``They have a 12-foot swimming pool that has a current'' of
moving water, she added. ``And I got in and swam for 40 minutes in a
12-foot pool and just stayed there and swam.
   ``It's a wonderful thing,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I never saw
anything like it.''

   Five astronauts boarded the space
shuttle Columbia on Tuesday to wrap up a two-day dress rehearsal of
next month's planned launch that turned up no significant problems,
NASA officials said.
   The test allowed shuttle workers to check the shuttle's
electrical systems at the launch pad and gave Columbia's crew a
chance to interact with flight controllers at the Kennedy Space
Center and at mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Texas.
   ``It sets the stage for final launch preparations and the launch
of Columbia in the first week of August,'' said NASA spokesman
George Diller.
   ``This exercise is designed to be a high-fidelity test, in large
part a carbon copy of what will be occuring on launch day. We're
coming out with a very good test,'' said Diller.
   Shuttle managers will not announce a firm launch date until July
26, when they complete a flight readiness review.
   NASA is conducting the secret mission for the Department of
Defense and military space experts believe the astronauts will
deploy an advanced reconnaissance satellite.
   The practice session covers the final 24 hours of an actual space
shuttle countdown.
   ``This is as much a people test as it is a test for the space
shuttle itself,'' Diller explained. ``It is a good opportunity to
bring out any bugs in all of the procedures that will be used when
Columbia is launched next month.''

   Thousands of armed men roamed an ethnically
troubled Black Sea region Tuesday where at least 16 people have been
killed and 239 injured in three days of gunfights, kidnappings and
beatings, officials reported.
   A national Interior Ministry official said some of the 3,000
ministry soldiers patrolling the Abkhazia region in Soviet Georgia
formed a human barrier between Georgians and Abkhazians who earlier
fought two battles along the Galidze River.
   ``The situation is very serious because so many people have
guns,'' said Vladislav G. Ardzinba, a national legislator from
Sukhumi, capital of Abkhazia, where both Georgians and Abkhazians
claim discrimination by the other.
   Many people in the region have shotguns or hunting rifles, and
several reports said mobs looted firearms, including automatic
weapons, from police stations and jails.
   A high official in Sukhumi said snipers fired at the local
Communist Party and Interior Ministry buildings, and other armed men
cut road and rail transport and some communications with the area
870 miles south of Moscow.
   ``In effect, they are spreading terror,'' he said by telephone.
   Deputy Interior Minister Ivan F. Shilov said on the national
television news show Vremya that 16 people had been killed and 239
injured, 188 of whom were hospitalized.
   He said the most volatile situation Tuesday was near Ochamchira,
on the coast south of Sukhumi, where the soldiers were acting as a
barrier between Georgians and Abkhazians.
   Zarya Vostoka, a Georgian newspaper, said 5,000 people were armed
in the Sukhumi area on Sunday night and there were exchanges of
gunfire.
   Violence was reported in Tkvarcheli, Gulripsh, Gali, and Gudauta
in Abkhazia, and in Zugdide in western Georgia. The official news
agency Tass said authorities had confiscated more than 300 weapons.
   Prisoners freed by a mob from a jail in Zugdide may be among the
armed marauders. Tass said only 14 of the 180 prisoners had been
recaptured.
   Ardzinba, the national legislator from Sukhumi, said the riots
started Saturday with the beating of an Abkhazian. The Georgian
Foreign Ministry said earlier the violence began when Abkhazians
attacked Georgians.
   The legislator said many Abkhazians want the 3,320-square-mile
region, where Georgians outnumber them 240,000 to 94,000, to become
a a 16th Soviet republic.
   Tass said there were no riots Monday, but the official in Sukhumi
gave a different picture.
   On the border with western Georgia, ``masses of people are moving
against the Interior Ministry troops,'' said the official, who
refused to give his name for fear of attack. ``They are armed, with
shotguns and automatic weapons.''
   V. Arseniev, a correspondent for the government daily Izvestia,
reported seeing ``agitated young people with hunting rifles and
sawed-off shotguns'' Monday night as he drove into Abkhazia from
Tbilisi, capital of Georgia.
   ``In the Gali region, pickets shot at a car which seemed
suspicious to them right before our eyes,'' he wrote.
   At least 400 Abkhazians and Georgians shot at each other along
the Gumista River near Sukhumi, said Gizo Grzeledze of the Georgian
Foreign Ministry, reading from Tuesday's Zarya Vostoka over the
telephone.
   ``Large groups of armed people moved in the direction of
Ochamchira'' but were stopped by soldiers at the Galidze River, the
newspaper said, without giving the date of the incident.
   The official in Sukhumi said, ``Abkhazians stood alone on the
river for 10 hours, defending the border against Georgians, until
the arrival of Interior Ministry troops.''
   On Monday night, ``a group of 300 to 500 Georgians crossed the
river and attacked the village of Merkula,'' he said. Two people
were wounded, one critically, he said.
   Rioters ripped up railroad tracks and halted road and rail
traffic into the area, Zarya Vostoka reported. The Sukhumi official
said boats took women and children out of the city.
   ``There is no food,'' he said. ``Seaside vacationers are
desperate for means to leave the city.''
   A Tass report said tens of thousands of tourists were stuck
without water for hours in halted, sweltering trains. It said 2,000
were evacuated Monday night.
   The Sukhumi official said 90 percent of businesses were closed.
Tass put the number at more than half in some cities and said
demonstrations continued in several towns.
   After the violence began Saturday, Ardzinba said, ``the worst is
that the police started to help their own, handing over weapons'' to
members of their own ethnic group.
   The Sukhumi official said 1,000 Georgians attacked about
5,000-8,000 demonstrators in the city's main square.
   ``They were naked to the waist,'' he said of the Georgians.
``There were two heavy trucks moving in front of them. The men were
carrying firearms and clubs, and they ran through the city
shouting.''
   In April, ethnic conflicts in Abkhazia set off demonstrations in
Tbilisi that developed into demands for Georgian independence from
the Soviet Union. Soldiers crushed the protests and at least 20
people were killed.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Suggests Moving Up Party Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday suggested
that a congress of the Communist Party scheduled for 1991 be moved
up to next year. That would give him another chance to remove more
oldtimers opposed to reforms.
   The official Tass news agency said Gorbachev made the proposal at
a meeting with Communist Party chiefs from the 15 Soviet republics
and from territorial and regional party committees. It said he
recommended that the 28th Communist Party congress be held in the
fall of 1990.
   Tass reported Gorbachev rejected calls to hold an emergency party
congress in addition to the one scheduled for 1991 on grounds that
many major political events are already on the calendar. Among the
events he listed are a a meeting of the party's policy-making
Central Committee, the second session of the new Congress of
People's Deputies _ the Soviet parliament _ and local elections.
   The Central Committee meeting is expected to be held this summer,
the Congress of People's Deputies session will open in October and
the elections are set for next spring.
   Gorbachev has increased the pace of political reform since taking
office as Communist Party general secretary at the last party
congress in 1985. He became president last October and could
strengthen his power base with a party congress.
   The congress would give Gorbachev an opportunity to revamp the
Central Committee beyond changes made in April at a Central
Committee meeting. At that meeting he engineered the retirement of
110 senior officials, including many holdovers from the era of the
late President Leonid I. Brezhnev blamed for leading the country
into an economic and political morass.
   In April the Central Committee promoted many non-voting members
to full voting status but was not empowered to bring in new members.
That is the exclusive job of a party congress.
   Several important party officials allied with Gorbachev are not
Central Committee members and he could bring them aboard at the
party congress. They include the party chiefs in the ethnic hotspots
of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the Baltics and Armenia and
Azerbaijan in the Caucasus.
   In a speech at Tuesday's meeting Gorbachev said the 20
million-member party was lagging behind the progress being made in
Soviet society and it could lose its leading position.

   The body of the only unaccounted for
victim of a 1987 bridge collapse was found downstream, where it
apparently had been snagged since the accident, police said Tuesday.
   Relatives identified the body of Edward Meyer of Albany by using
keys, jewelry and clothing found on the remains, said Trooper Edward
Dyer.
   A boater on Saturday spotted the body floating in the Mohawk
River near Schenectady, said Schenectady County Medical Examiner Dr.
Robert Sullivan.
   It was about 20 miles downstream from where the Schoharie Creek
bridge collapsed. The creek empties into the Mohawk River.
   Meyer was the last unaccounted for victim of the April 5, 1987,
collapse. Six cars and one truck fell more than 80 feet into the
rain-swollen creek. Nine other bodies were recovered shortly after
the accident.
   Sullivan said Meyer's body may have been snagged on a branch or
some other protrusion on the river's bottom, preventing it from
surfacing. He said hot summer weather probably caused the body to
float to the surface.
   Meyer, 50, was returning to Albany from a bowling tournament in
Syracuse when the raging creek wore away bridge supports and caused
the New York State Thruway bridge to collapse.

   A former congressman who recently returned from
Pakistan said Tuesday that members of the Afghan resistance would be
willing to link release of Soviet prisoners to the release of
Americans held in Indochina.
   William M. Hendon, chairman of the POW Publicity Fund in McLean,
Va., said the warm reception by the mujahedeen during an initial
visit to their base in Peshawar, Pakistan, led him to return with
relatives of servicemen who have been missing since as early as 1961.
   ``What we've accomplished is the biggest deal since the end of
the war,'' said Hendon, whose fund was set up to offer a $2.5
million reward to anyone who escapes, defects and brings an American
POW to freedom.
   ``They have indicated a clear desire to help ... and they are in
a position to help,'' said Hendon, from Asheville, N.C. ``That's the
exciting thing about it.''
   Hendon and the relatives have been in Washington this week to
talk about their weeklong trip, from which they returned Saturday.
   He said he would ask Congress to support further arms shipments
to fight the Kabul government although the mujahedeen did not make
that a condition of help.
   ``They said that their Islamic teaching and their genuine
compassion for our men and they view this as a humanitarian gesture
to help their friends the Americans ...,'' he said. ``We believe
that the way we can help them the most is to help them win the war
that they have fought for 11 years now, that they have suffered 1.5
million casualties, they have 45,000 of their own people disappeared
or missing.''
   Hendon said he that the idea came to him after reading an article
in the Aug. 19, 1988, issue of ``Asiaweek'' magazine during a flight
over Laos. The article about Afghanistan mentioned the strong desire
of the Soviets to recover their prisoners taken in the civil war in
that country.
   That and other news accounts mentioned how intent the Soviets
were on winning the release of the prisoners. The Soviet government
was even sending delegations of ordinary men and women to plead for
the release of the prisoners, he said.
   Hendon said he initially met in June with two fundamentalist
leaders, Burhanuddin Rabbani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and other
``top leaders'' of the resistance.
   The group then met with Dr. Zabihullah Mojadeddi, general
secretary of the Afghan National Liberation Front, and others,
Hendon said.
   ``They said to us directly, `We will help,''' said one of the
relatives, Beth Stewart of Washington, D.C. ``There were no hollow
statements, no platitudes.''
   ``They've lived what we've lived for many, many years because of
their own losses,'' said Beth Bischoff of Wilson, N.C.
   Ms. Stewart's father and Mrs. Bischoff's father-in-law are
missing in Southeast Asia.
   The State Department says it has received no reports from
Islamabad about such a possibility. A small number of prisoners was
exchanged last fall, and there have been periodic meetings.
   Although nothing would be wrong with a three-way deal, a State
Department source said, POWs are considered a humanitarian issue,
meaning they should not be part of political negotiations that lead
to a settlement.
   The Pentagon had no comment on the proposal, said Lt. Col. Keith
Schneider, a spokesman. ``I have no idea what the possibilities
are,'' he said.
   The official government position is that it is unable to prove
the existence of POWs in Vietnam although it won't rule out the
possibility. The number of Americans unaccounted for in Southeast
Asia is 2,348.

<HEAD>Agriculture Appropriations Bill Leads to Red Dye Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed farm legislation Tuesday
accompanied by a report calling for further study of Red Dye No. 3
before any ban on the food additive as a cancer-causing substance.
   However, the chairman of the committee that submitted the bill
said the government was not bound to hold off on such a ban.
   Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., said his committee's report seeking
more study of the dye that gives maraschino cherries their brilliant
color does not legally require the Food and Drug Administration to
leave it on the market.
   His statements came in response to questions from Rep. Ted Weiss,
D-N.Y., during debate over the $42.1 billion appropriations bill for
rural development, agriculture and related agencies, which includes
the FDA.
   The bill, which sets spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1, was approved 394-26.
   In 1960, when Congress called for a ban on foods that cause
cancer in laboratory animals, Red Dye No. 3 and others were put on a
provisional list that allowed them to stay on the market for an
additional two years pending further study.
   Weiss, who chairs a House Government Operations subcommittee that
has held hearings on the issue, said during the debate, ``Since
1962, the FDA has given the industry somewhere between 30 and 40
extensions of the provisional listing of Red Dye No. 3.''
   ``FDA scientists have concluded that Red Dye No. 3 causes
cancer,'' he added. ``The ostensible grounds for further study
outlined in the committee's report _ to test the so-called
`secondary mechanism' of the dye _ have already been studied and
dismissed in 1987 by a panel of expert government scientists in a
100-plus page report.''
   Weiss contended, ``Under the law, the FDA has no option but to
follow through with its stated intentions to terminate the
provisional listing of Red Dye No. 3. ... It is high time that it do
so.''
   Large doses of the additive have caused tumors in rats, leading
consumer groups to demand that it be banned.
   The language about further tests was put in the report on the
appropriations bill after requests by growers and canners, who would
like to postpone action against the dye.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that FDA commissioner
Frank Young said his office worked with proponents of the provision.
He has maintained that the additive doesn't pose a health threat.
   The report says the Appropriations Committee ``expects the Food
and Drug Administration to provide the technical expertise necessary
... for a long-term study to determine if the secondary mechanism
effect can be confirmed for ... Red Dye No. 3. ...
   ``The committee further expects the Food and Drug Administration
to review the results of this study, in addition to any other
scientifically based findings which may emerge, prior to making any
decision relating to changes in the provisionally or permanently
approved uses of this color.''
   The ``secondary mechanism'' refers to arguments that the dye is
not a primary cause of cancer, and causes tumors only when used in
doses higher than would ever be consumed through its use as a food
coloring.
   The appropriations bill covers spending for all agriculture
programs, including research, extension services, animal and plant
inspections, crop insurance, commodity credit corp. and conservation
programs.
   It also covers rural development programs such as the Farmers
Home Administration, Rural Development Insurance Fund and Rural
Electrification Administration. Nutrition programs, including food
stamps; women, infant and children food supplements, and food for
the needy fall under the legislation, as do foreign agriculture
service programs.

   No golden arches here. Just great
hamburgers. Great big hamburgers.
   In fact, the burger at Sioux Sundries is about the only thing
that puts this burg _ population 360 _ on the map.
   People from all 50 states and at least 14 countries have stopped
by to sample the specialty of the diner in the back of the 20-foot
by 60-foot store.
   It's a 28-ounce burger, with cheese, onions, lettuce, pickles and
tomato, and a bag of potato chips on the side for $6.00.
   ``Who would think that just a hamburger would create all this
fuss?'' says Delores Wasserburger, who's been frying the giant
patties for 18 years.
   The way Ms. Wasserburger explained it, it all started one day
when rancher Bill Coffee brought in a few hungry ranch hands and
asked for a big hamburger.
   ``We had your basic large hamburger, but these guys were
hungry,'' Ms. Wasserburger recalled.
   She whipped up her first Coffee Burger, 28 ounces of ground beef
in two patties with cheese on a bun that comes nowhere close to
covering it all.
   ``I have no idea how many I serve a day, let alone how many I've
served over the years,'' she said.
   The diner, which has five booths and a chrome-and-formica
counter, also serves traditional short-order meals, including
chicken, shrimp and sandwiches. But most customers go for the burgers
   ``I've cooked them for people for breakfast,'' Ms. Wasserburger
said.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Changes Mind, Says He'll Run For President</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Solidarity deciding against party
discipline in vote. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
reversed course Tuesday and announced he would be a candidate for
the new post of president of Poland.
   The president will be picked Wednesday by the National Assembly,
Poland's two-chambered legislature.
   Solidarity lawmakers decided overwhelmingly Tuesday night to
permit union legislators to follow their consciences when they vote
for or against Jaruzelski.
   ``I think it was a good decision,'' said Deputy Bronislaw
Geremek, chairman of the Solidarity parliamentary group. After a
long, emotional debate on Jaruzelski's candidacy, only 38 union
lawmakers wanted to require party discipline in the vote.
   The Solidarity-backed delegation makes up 46 percent of the
assembly, and most seemed likely to vote against Jaruzelski, who
imposed a martial law crack- down on the independent trade union in
1981.
   But Geremek indicated Jaruzelski would win even without
Solidarity support.
   ``I can say Gen. Jaruzelski should be elected, by the votes of
the coalition,'' he said.
   The communist coalition has 300 of the 560 votes in the National
Assembly, and Solidarity has 259. One seat was left open by the
death of a Solidarity legislator.
   Jerzy Stepien, a Solidarity senator from Kielce said during the
debate: ``Let's not be afraid of confrontation. It is bound to
happen.''
   Jaruzelski said a ``sense of duty'' drove him to change his mind
after announcing June 30 he would not run because he was linked more
with martial law than with current democratic changes.
   The Communist Party leadership asked Jaruzelski to reconsider and
he said he was swayed by support from the two allied parties of the
communist coalition and other groups.
   An announcement by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa that he would
cooperate with Jaruzelski as president and words of praise from
President Bush during a visit last week also appear to have helped
persuade him.
   Jaruzelski said the decision was difficult but many emphasized to
him the need for continuity and stability in Poland's government and
international position.
   ``It was commonly stressed that avoidance of responsibility in
such a special moment would be in contradiction to the duties of a
politician and a soldier and to the logic of my public service in
the recent years,'' Jaruzelski said.
   The president will appoint the next government, which must deal
with a disintergrating food market and skyrocketing inflation that a
new report shows headed for an annual rate of 160 percent.
   The Solidarity lawmakers said Jaruzelski did little to help his
cause during a six-hour questioning Monday by their delegation,
failing to repudiate the martial law that imprisoned some among them.
   ``I feel he is responsible for all of the mistakes. He is
responsible so I cannot support him,'' said Zofia Kuratowska, a
deputy speaker of the Senate.
   Jan Litynski, a deputy for Walbrzych, said the caucus was divided
between those who simply wanted to block Jaruzelski from becoming
president and those who see him as the lesser evil among other
possible candidates.
   Solidarity lawmakers could vote against Jaruzelski or vote to
abstain. They could also simply not participate, which would help
Jaruzelski by reducing the votes he needs to win.
   Ten to 15 Solidarity lawmakers will take that option, Litynski
predicted.
   A simple majority of those present will elect the president, who
can serve up to two six-year terms and control Poland's military and
foreign relations.
   Jaruzelski said opposition to him is ``understandable,
inseparably linked with openness and democratization of political
life,'' and acknowledged he could lose the vote.
   Jaruzelski's success appeared to depend on how well the communist
coalition could maintain internal discipline.
   Wednesday's vote was to be an open roll call, which should make
it easier for the communists and allied Peasant and Democratic
parties to insist that each lawmaker vote for Jaruzelski.
   Some members of the Communist and Peasant parties were elected
with Solidarity support, and it was not clear if they could support
a Jaruzelski candidacy.
   According to the opposition newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, Jaruzelski
has told Solidarity leaders he felt encouraged to run by statements
at the July 7-8 meeting of Warsaw Pact allies in Bucharest and the
stance backing him taken by the Polish military leadership.
   Jaruzelski moved to restore Solidarity's legal status this year
after a seven-year ban. He argued that dialogue must be carried on
with all social forces in order to help Poland out of its economic
crisis.
   After talks that ended in April, authorities agreed to admit the
opposition to parliament through partially democratic elections, the
freest held in Poland since World War II.
   Solidarity was restored to legal status April 17 and in June it
won all but one of the 261 seats open to it in the new Senate and
the Sejm, or parliament.

<HEAD>Energy Department Says Restart Date to Be Set Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said Tuesday it will
decide within two weeks when to restart the first of three
deactivated nuclear reactors in South Carolina that are the nation's
only source of a gas needed to make nuclear weapons.
   John Tuck, the undersecretary of energy, told reporters the
department was in the final stages of working out details of a
restart timetable with Westinghouse Savannah River, which operates
the Savannah River reactors under a federal contract.
   ``Within a couple of weeks, not far beyond the first of August''
the restart date will be set, he said, adding that the timetable
would be coupled with announcement of a broader plan for ensuring
safer and cleaner operation of the plant.
   The three Savannah River reactors, near Aiken, S.C., are the sole
source of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that is needed
in the manufacture of thermonuclear warheads. The three were closed
down last year for technical and safety reasons.
   Early resumption of tritium production is considered crucial
because supplies are falling. The material must be periodically
replaced in weapons in order to maintain their effectiveness. The
exact size of the tritium stockpile is classified, but the Pentagon
said earlier this year that a supply squeeze was imminent.
   Tuck commented after testifying before a special panel of the
House Armed Services Committee that is assessing a variety of
problems at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes 17 major
facilities in 12 states. These plants design, test and produce
nuclear weapons and are operated by private companies under federal
contract.
   Tuck said Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is strongly opposed
to a bill sponsored by Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., and a companion
bill in the House sponsored by Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that would
transfer authority for studying the health effects of radiation on
workers to the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Tuck said Watkins wanted to retain that authority within his
department.
   ``To excuse DOE from the responsibility of conducting
epidemiologic surveys of its work force would be to excuse it from a
key element of its responsibility to protect the health and safety
of its workers,'' Tuck said.
   Wirth said the Energy Department should not be trusted to assess
the health effects of radiation, since it is a promoter of nuclear
energy and weapons production.
   ``This appearance of the `fox guarding the chicken coop' has
inevitably led to a dramatic failure to win employee and public
confidence in the health research conducted by DOE,'' Wirth said.
   Tuck said Watkins also was opposed to legislation that would
broaden the powers of a newly created Defense Nuclear Facilities
Safety Board, an independent group that will oversee the weapons
program. It is expected to start functioning this fall.

   A ceremony marking the issuance of a
25-cent postage stamp honoring Ernest Hemingway was held Tuesday
outside the Kansas City Star building where the writer once worked.
   About 50 people attended the ceremony, where Postmaster James
Wood presented an enlargement of the stamp to David Zeeck, managing
editor of The Kansas City Star. The stamp was based on a 1957
photograph by Yousuf Karsh.
   Hemingway, a Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, worked at
the newspaper for about six months beginning in October 1917 before
leaving to work as an ambulance driver on the Italian front in World
War I. He died in 1961.
   Hemingway's novels and short stories were characterized by crisp
writing. He often credited his style to the Star's stylebook, which
emphasizes conciseness, Zeeck said.
   The ceremony in Kansas City followed the first-day issue of the
stamp Monday at the writer's former home in Key West, Fla.

   The State Department said Tuesday it has asked
France to clarify reports that Paris is seeking to sell sensitive
rocket technology to Brazil, a country with military trade links to
Libya.
   So far, the French Foreign Ministry ``has not yet said what, if
anything, has been approved for transfer to Brazil,'' said Richard
Boucher, the department spokesman.
   The Washington Times, quoting unidentified officials in a story
published Tuesday, said the French Embassy in Brasilia has notified
the U.S. Embassy there that France has granted preliminary approval
for the transfer of technology relating to the Viking liquid-fuel
rocket engine, which is used to propel the French Ariane
space-launch missile.
   The transfer could be in violation of the Missile Technology
Control Regime, signed in 1987 by several countries including France
and the United States.
   Boucher said the regime states ``there is a strong presumption
against the transfer of sensitive rocket technology, which is
classified as ``category one.''
   If France were to transfer a ``category one'' rocket, Paris would
have to require that it not be transferred without the consent of
the French government, Boucher said.
   He also said the United States has in the past raised with the
Brazilians its concerns about military trade with Libya, a country
the United States has accused of inciting acts of terrorism.
   But Boucher said, ``The supposition that French rocket technology
will flow to Libya is merely speculation.''

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas Kill Rival Insurgents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fundamentalist Afghan insurgents
acknowledged Monday they killed members of a rival guerrilla
faction. They were responding to reports that they ambushed and
executed 30 men from the other group.
   Rebel sources said the two factions are involved in a power
struggle that could hinder efforts to overthrow the Soviet-sponsored
Afghan government.
   Reacting Monday to the earlier reports of killings on July 9 in
Takhar Province, 140 miles north of Kabul, Bush administration
officials deplored the action but said U.S. support of the Afghan
guerrillas would continue.
   ``Our commitment to support the mujahedeen is very clear and the
nature and character of our support is unchanged and it will
continue,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. The
guerrillas call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   The dead, including seven field commanders, belonged to the
Jamiat-e-Islami guerrillas. Jamiat said the ambush was carried out
by the rival Hezb-e-Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a hard-line
anti-American fundamentalist.
   Jamiat spokesman Mohammad Shaoib said five people were killed in
the ambush and 25 were executed later. Qaribur Rehman Saeed,
spokesman for Hezb-e-Islami, denied anyone was executed but
acknowledged some members of Jamiat were killed.
   Saeed did not say how many were killed and said his group was
investigating.
   The struggle for power among guerrilla groups is almost as old as
the Afghan civil war, which began after a communist coup in April
1978. Guerrilla sources say scores of men have been killed.
   Those slain in the latest incident were from Afghanistan's
northern provinces of Badakhshan, Kunduz, Takhar and Baghlan and
were returning from a strategy meeting with Jamiat commander Ahmed
Shah Masoud, Shaoib said.
   Shaoib gave no details of the ambush or executions. ``It is a
great loss for all Afghanistan, especially for the north,'' he said.
   ``In the northern provinces, there are only two powers, Jamiat
and Hezb,'' said Saeed, the Hezb-e-Islami spokesman. ``Many of our
commanders have been killed by Masoud's people.''
   Masoud formed a northern council to incorporate guerrillas
belonging to the seven rebel parties based in Pakistan. In a message
to his headquarters in Peshawar more than one year ago, he said he
was consolidating forces and establishing an Islamic army.
   ``The conflict started right from the beginning, when Masoud
wanted the upper hand in the north,'' Saeed said. ``Masoud wanted to
clear the area of Hezb mujahedeen.''
   According to Saeed, Masoud agreed to temporary cease-fires with
Soviet troops when the Red Army was involved in the Afghan war, and
the guerrillas fought among themselves when Hezb-e-Islami forces
refused to recognize those arrangements.
   Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal from
Afghanistan on Feb. 15, after nine years of involvement in the war.
   Sources independent of either group said they feared the internal
conflict would cripple guerrilla efforts to capture
government-controlled cities in the north.
   A moderate insurgent, also speaking privately, said Masoud's
forces could not approach Kabul, the Afghan capital, because
Hezb-e-Islami blocked them in central Parwan province.
   In Kabul on Tuesday, the government said soldiers sealed off and
searched the capital's southern sector Tuesday after reports that
guerrillas were planning to infiltrate.
   On Monday, air force fighter jets bombed rebel bases near the
eastern city of Jalalabad, killing at least 78 guerrillas and
wounding 114, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani told
reporters in Kabul.
   He said the rebel bases were around Surkhdewar, 77 miles from
Kabul. The report could not be confirmed independently.
   Tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled out at dawn Tuesday
to erect road blocks around the southern district, home to about
one-fifth of Kabul's 2.5 million people.
   Amani said the search lasted five hours, but gave no details.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The mother of a former army
commander expelled in April after a coup attempt has begun a hunger
strike to protest his detention by U.S. immigration authorities, a
newspaper said Tuesday.
   Ketly Biamby, mother of ex-Presidential Guard commander Col.
Philippe Biamby, began her fast Monday, the independent daily Le
Matin reported.
   Mrs. Biamby told the newspaper her son and two other leaders of
the coup attempt, who also have been on hunger strikes, ``have
committed no infringement of American law and have been jailed
illegally.''
   In an interview with privately owned Tele-Haiti Monday night, she
accused U.S. immigration authorities of jailing her son and Col.
Himmler Rebu and Lt. Col. Leonce Qualo in New York and refusing to
review their case.
   The three were expelled from Haiti to the neighboring Dominican
Republic on April 3 after troops loyal to Haitian ruler Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril foiled their attempted coup the day before.
   They flew to Miami two days later and asked for political asylum.
They have remained jailed in the U.S. Immigration Service Detention
Facility in New York pending review of their request.
   The U.S. Embassy has said the three are not under indictment and
are free to leave the United States when they want to.
   ``All they have to do is withdraw their (political asylum) demand
and they are free to go,'' U.S. Embassy Spokeswoman Susan Clyde said
Tuesday.
   Mrs. Biamby denied the U.S. Embassy claim that the three can
leave. She said their passports had been confiscated, preventing
their departure.
   Biamby, 36, Rebu, 38, and Qualo, 35, began a hunger strike June
26 to protest their detention. Mrs. Biamby said her son was
hospitalized July 13 and was refusing transfusions.
   Charles Troy, spokesman for the New York District office of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said the three are in a
medical unit at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.
   ``Those three gentlemen are not accepting solid food. They have
been seen taking fluid, including juice and water,'' he said.
   ``They are under constant medical treatment in the medical unit
of the facility. Their vital signs are constantly being monitored.
Doctors are on the case.''
   On the passport and asylum issues, Troy said the INS position is
the same as that of the State Department _ their passports would be
returned if they withdraw their asylum application. ``If they don't
wish to go back to Haiti, we will assist them _ so there's no
problem there,'' said Troy.
   ``They applied for asylum and were interviewed by our officers.
We got a State Department advisory back that said they weren't being
persecuted down there in Haiti,'' he added.
   ``So we issued them a notice of intent to deny their application.
By regulation they could submit a rebuttal and they did so. All
three have retained counsel.
   ``Their rebuttal was forwarded to the Department of State for its
advisory opinion. That's where the case rests now.''
   After the State Department delivers its opinon the INS will make
a final decision, according to Troy. He said he did not know how

   Mrs. Biamby's ``declarations have provoked a wave of emotion and
indignation in all Haitian families,'' conservative politician
Hubert De Ronceray said Tuesday.
   Avril claimed the coup attempt and a rebellion the following week
by two units, also crushed by loyalists, was financed by supporters
of former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled into exile in
France in 1986.

<HEAD>Roseanne to Get New Job, But Not Rich, Say Producers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roseanne Conner, the wise-cracking mom on
ABC's hit comedy ``Roseanne,'' will be unemployed for a while at the
beginning of the new season but will eventually get a new job, the
show's producers said Tuesday.
   There were rumors that the Conners, played by Roseanne Barr and
John Goodman, would win the lottery and become rich, but that rumor
was quashed.
   Producers Tom Werner and Marcy Carsey were asked about the
``Roseanne'' lottery rumor, which turned up in a supermarket
tabloid, and Carsey said it was untrue.
   ``I don't know where they get this stuff. I really don't,'' she
said.
   Both were attending an ABC news conference on their newest show,
``Chicken Soup,'' which stars comedian Jackie Mason.
   Werner said there would be no major changes on ``Roseanne'' in
the upcoming season. Roseanne quit her job at the factory in the
last episode of last season.
   ``Roseanne's going to have a new job, we haven't even locked in
on that, but basically it's pretty much the same stories as we've
been telling,'' said Werner.
   ``We think it's a very fertile area, someone who's unemployed,
and the first few scripts we're dealing with that. Obviously, in a
family like this, you need two incomes, so pretty soon Roseanne
Conner is going to find a job.''
   Carsey said Roseanne might possibly get a more upscale job, but
there weren't even any definite plans for that.
   Carsey and Werner also produce ``The Cosby Show'' and ``A
Different World'' on NBC. Carsey said she doesn't know if Cosby will
sign for a seventh year, but she would like to see the show continue
after next season.

<HEAD>Storms in the Southeast and Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms drenched the Mississippi Valley and southeastern
United States on Tuesday, and showers and thunderstorms developed
ahead of a cold front in the Midwest.
   The Southeast storms were part of a slow-moving cold front, and
were clustered over Florida, southern Georgia and southern Alabama.
   In the Midwest, showers and thunderstorms fell over Wisconsin,
Iowa, southern Minnesota and northern Illinois. Strong thunderstorms
developed over central Iowa and southern Minnesota.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from northeastern Texas to
western Tennessee and southern Illinois. A few showers fell in
northern Maine. The rest of the nation had fair to partly sunny
skies.
   Temperatures topped 100 degrees in southwest Texas. In Midland by
midday, the temperature had already surpassed a previous record high
for the date of 104 degrees set in 1981.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Lompoc, Calif., to 110 degrees at Needles, Calif. The low
for the Lower 48 states was 31 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
the lower and middle Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast, with
showers and thunderstorms most numerous in northern Florida, the
central Gulf Coast states, the upper Ohio Valley and the lower Great
Lakes region; widely scattered thunderstorms over Arizona; and sunny
skies in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were expected to climb over 90 degrees from Florida
to Texas and across most of the western third of the country, with
readings above 100 degrees from southern Arizona to the central
valleys of California.
   Highs were predicted in the 70s for the lower Ohio Valley, the
upper Great Lakes and along the Pacific Coast, and in the 80s
elsewhere.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Cite Secret Document Issue, Request Delay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing problems with the use of classified
material, prosecutors on Tuesday requested a delay in the
Iran-Contra case against a former CIA station chief charged with
obstruction and lying.
   The trial of Joseph Fernandez was scheduled to start July 24, but
a change in the CIA's position regarding certain classified
information ``may substantially complicate'' the case, prosecutors
said in court papers.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh proposed that
July 24 be set aside for a hearing on the classified information
issue and that a trial begin ``as soon as practicable thereafter.''
   The prosecution didn't specify the nature of the change by the
Central Intelligence Agency, other than to describe it as ``a new
emphasis in the CIA's position.''
   Fernandez and others under indictment in Iran-Contra cases have
requested declassification of large amounts of sensitive documents
for use in their courtroom defenses. Intelligence agencies have been
reluctant to declassify much of the information out of concern for
national security.
   As CIA station chief in Costa Rica, Fernandez assisted former
White House aide Oliver L. North's secret supply network aiding the
Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebel
force battling Nicaragua's Marxist government.
   Questioned by the CIA inspector general's office and the Tower
Commission in 1987, Fernandez allegedly said he wasn't certain North
was running the network and asserted that a secret airstrip
construction project had been initiated by the Costa Rican
government. In fact, the airstrip project was initiated by North,
Fernandez and others to help supply the Contras.

<HEAD>Aide Says Commerce Secretary Will Decide Whether to Modify Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher will decide
soon whether to modify controversial regulations requiring shrimpers
to equip their nets with turtle-excluder devices, a spokesman said
Tuesday.
   Shrimpers claim the devices, designed to keep endangered sea
turtles from being tangled and killed in their nets, also keep out a
substantial portion of their catch because of clogging by debris and
seaweed.
   While opponents of the devices want Mosbacher to continue
suspending enforcement of the regulations until a study on the
devices is completed by the National Academy of Sciences in
February, Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman said that did not appear
likely.
   The Coast Guard last week ordered enforcement of the regulations
be suspended pending Mosbacher's decision. While the Commerce
Department has its own enforcement force, it relies on Coast Guard
vessels for the at-sea inspections.
   ``There is not a whole lot that can be done in terms of a
wholesale suspension of the regulations,'' said Gorman, citing a
federal court ruling upholding the law and a public comment period
on the devices before their implementation.
   Gorman said the judge who upheld the law involving the devices,
U.S. District Court Judge Patrick Carr of New Orleans, also agreed
the regulations are not subject to the pending study.
   Mosbacher, however, has asked for a survey of the Gulf Coast to
determine whether sargassum grass is a problem.
   ``Shrimpers claim an enormous infestation of this seaweed along
the coast is clogging the nets and rendering the (devices)
ineffective and causing a large loss of shrimp,'' Gorman said.
   The survey, he said, began at the beginning of the month and an
interim report is due within the next couple of days. Mosbacher will
decide by week's end or next week whether the regulations ``can be
in some small way modified,'' he said.
   Like the devices themselves, the survey by the National Marine
Fisheries Service is controversial, with Rep. Solomon Ortiz,
D-Texas, saying he is dissatisfied with the way the tests are being
conducted.
   Ortiz said nets are being brought in after 20 minutes, rather
than being kept in the water for three or four hours as shrimpers
would.
   ``I don't think this is comparable to fishing conditions, and of
course they're going to get different results,'' Ortiz said.
   Ortiz and other lawmakers said the devices reduce a shrimper's
catch by 17 percent to 35 percent, but with the recent seaweed
infestation, losses could reach 50 percent.

   Congress, which has a tough time agreeing on
ways to clean up the environment, is trying to take a small step in
that direction in its own House.
   A bipartisan group of House members has written the House
Administration Committee asking for the removal of polystyrene cups
from the restaurant system.
   ``If we are to pass and enforce new laws to ensure a cleaner
nation, we must, ourselves, be willing to take the first step,''
said the letter signed by 92 lawmakers.
   The group asks that cups made of a biodegradable material replace
the current foam ones. ``The use of such non-biodegradable products
in the House food service system is unnecessary and ill-advised,''
they said.

   Four members of Congress said Tuesday in a
lawsuit that President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III made an unconstitutional side agreement with congressional
leaders on $49.8 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras.
   The side agreement provides that the Bush administration won't
obligate funds appropriated under the law after next Nov. 30 unless
it receives unanimous consent in writing from nine congressional
leaders, said the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court.
   The suit says the side agreement doesn't follow constitutional
procedures requiring consideration by the entire House and Senate.
   It was filed by U.S. Reps. Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Chuck Douglas,
R-N.H.; Philip Crane, R-Ill., and Robert Smith, R-N.H.
   Burton and Crane voted for the law providing the assistance while
Douglas and Smith voted against it.
   The votes by the four congressmen ``have been rendered
ineffective and substantially nullified'' and they have been
inhibited in their performance of their constitutional duties, they
said in the lawsuit.
   Bush on April 18 signed into law a bipartisan plan to give the
Contras non-military aid.
   The aid is intended to sustain the rebels until Nicaragua holds
elections early next year.

   An American attorney died Tuesday of injuries
suffered July 6 when a Palestinian grabbed the wheel of an Israeli
bus and drove it into a ravine, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Rita Levine, 39, of Philadelphia was the first American to perish
in the 19-month Arab uprising against the Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Ms. Levine suffered serious spinal cord injuries, broken ribs and
damaged lungs in the attack, said Ruth Mekel, a spokeswoman for
Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem.
   Her death raised to 15 the number of people killed in the attack,
in which a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip grabbed the steering
wheel of a bus, shouted in Arabic ``God is great!'' and forced it
off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway into a 200-foot ravine.
   Two of the dead were Canadians. Of the 27 injured, eight were
holders of U.S. passports, including Ms. Levine.
   The suspect in the attack, Abdel Hadi Suleiman Rassem Ghanem, 23,
reportedly carried out the assault to avenge his friend, who was
shot in a clash with Israeli troops and subsequently paralyzed.
   The body of Ms. Levine, 39, will be flown to the United States on
Wednesday, Ms. Mekel said.
   Ms. Levine reportedly came to Israel to learn Hebrew and was
hoping to open a dual law practice in Philadelphia and in the Jewish
state.
   ``She talked about a possibility of settling here,'' the hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Israeli leaders have blamed the Palestine Liberation Organization
for the attack and criticized the Bush administration for being slow
in defining the attack as terrorism.
   Joan Levine, speaking at a July 11 news conference that was
arranged by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said her sister had said
from her hospital bed that the incident was a terrorist attack.
   Choking back sobs, Joan Levine called her sister a ``champion of
the homeless and the handicapped'' when she practiced law in the
United States.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said in a statement to The
Associated Press:
   ``While we mourn Rita's death and send our deepest condolences to
her family, we continue to hear repeatedly contemptuous declarations
by the PLO praising this horrible terrorist act, the last of which
was made by the official PLO radio station in Baghdad few days ago.''
   Liel recalled how he visited Rita Levine in the Hadassah
Hospital's intensive care unit.
   ``She was impressive,'' he said. ``She was paralyzed, had
injuries all over, (but) she was talking that she thought about
coming to live here, thought about opening an option.''
   Ms. Levine was the first American to die in the Palestinian
revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied territorities. At least
567 Palestinians and 36 Israelis, including a U.S.-born Jewish
settler, have perished in the violence.
   Also on Tuesday, troops dispersing a stone-throwing mob in Gaza's
Khan Yunis refugee camp shot and killed Bassam Farouk Ahmed Al
Jabri, 16. Officials at Khan Yunis' Nasser hospital said the youth
was dead on arrival at the hospital with a gunshot wound to the
heart.
   The army confirmed that Al Jabri was shot by soldiers. It said Al
Jabri was in a group of youths that hurled rocks at an army unit in
the camp and he ``was known to security forces as an instigator and
participant in disturbances.''
   At least 12 other Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes
with soldiers in the Gaza Strip. Arab hospitals in the West Bank
said they treated seven wounded. The army said it was checking the
reports.
   In another development, the army unveiled its new tactic of
``camera ambushes'' in which hidden video cameras are used to
photograph Palestinian stone-throwers, much the same way police
watch traffic violators.
   A military spokesman said the tapes were used to detain
stone-throwers on the spot, and were accepted as evidence by
military courts.
   Israeli newspapers said the ``camera ambushes'' were being
concealed near markets, streets and intersections where
stone-throwing attacks are especially frequent.
   The daily Maariv said in a recent incident in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, two suspected stone-throwers who denied their
involvement in an attack were identified on the basis of a
videotape. It said the camera was set up on the city's main street.
   In the past, the Israeli army has used videotape to identify
ringleaders in mass demonstrations, the daily newspaper Al Hamishmar
said.
   Army cameramen also have secretly photographed incidents of
soldiers' brutality against Palestinians. These tapes were used to
teach soldiers to not repeat the offenses.

   Guests are out. So is a honeymoon. But a man
convicted three times of murder is getting married _ in jail _ to a
woman he met through an ad in a supermarket tabloid.
   James Morgan, convicted and sentenced to die three times for the
1977 murder of an elderly woman, got his marriage license Monday,
said Martin County Jail Administrator John Murphy.
   Morgan, 28, will wed Rita Marie Runge, 26, of Homestead, Fla.
   ``He seems sincere about it,'' Murphy said. ``He went through the
procedures.''
   The Florida Supreme Court has overturned Morgan's three
convictions on technical grounds. He is awaiting a fourth trial for
first-degree murder in the slaying of Gertrude Trbovich of Stuart,
Fla.
   That doesn't bother Miss Runge. ``I plan to marry him because I
love him and it doesn't matter whether he stays in prison or gets
out,'' she said. ``It's not going change the way I feel about him.''
   The couple met in a jailhouse visit in November 1988, five months
after she answered his tabloid ad for a pen pal.
   Murphy said he denied Morgan's request for guests at the wedding,
a list that was to include judges, prosecutors and several of his
lawyers.
   Morgan and his bride-to-be will be allowed a 30-minute visit
after the wedding, but an officer will be with them, Murphy said.
   ``Morgan asked for a three-hour contact visit,'' Murphy said.
``But that's not allowed.''

<HEAD>Interior Secretary Tells Governors Offshore Oil Drilling Must Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
said Tuesday that a proposed congressional moratorium on offshore
oil drilling is asking Americans to ``blindly reject even the
possibilities before us.''
   Democratic Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said Lujan's remarks at
the Western Governor's Conference were further evidence that
President Bush's administration is unresponsive to public concerns
about restricting drilling in environmentally sensitive areas.
   ``On the basis of what I've heard today, there isn't much
optimism ... of avoiding an environmental fight,'' Goldschmidt said,
complaining he had ``not found the administration responsive at
all.''
   Lujan said at a news conference later that his comments were not
intended to signal the administration's intent to wage a major
counterattack on the proposed one-year moratorium resolution, which
has passed the House and is awaiting final action in the Senate.
   ``It's not an all-out fight, but we will try to convince the
Senate that moratoria is not the way to go about it,'' Lujan said.
``We're not looking at drilling any of these offshore areas in the
next year or two. But we do need the opportunity to study the
environmental problems that have to be faced to determine which
areas we should not drill in, and with the moratorium as it is now,
we cannot even do the environmental studies.''
   Later, the interior secretary told reporters that, ``I don't mind
a moratorium as far as drilling is concerned'' so long as it doesn't
also ban research and environmental studies.
   Lujan's tone in his formal address to the 17 governors was
considerably less conciliatory, with several direct attacks against
Congress, which he said has displayed a ``can't-do attitude'' in its
moratorium proposal and is not facing the nation's vital need for
energy independence from foreign sources.
   ``By imposing moratoria, the Congress is saying that we should
blindly reject even the possibilities before us,'' Lujan said.
``Certainly we must assess the risks. We must realistically weigh
the dangers. We should never act recklessly. But let us never be
afraid to search for the facts and act wisely on them.''
   Lujan also said the concern about oil spills is misdirected
against offshore drilling operations, which he said have spilled
only minuscule amounts of oil since a 1969 accident in Santa Barbara.
   ``While tankers continue to spill oil into our waters, and
offshore drilling continues to provide a record of environmentally
sound production, why are we attacking offshore drilling, and
letting the tankers nestle in their harbors?'' Lujan asked.
   ``Decreasing oil pollution in our waters can best be accomplished
by decreasing the amount of oil transported by ship,'' he said,
calling for an analysis of the feasibility of developing deep-water
oil transfer facilities, where oil would be transferred to shore
from ships.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper also raised oil spill questions in a
presentation that sharply criticized the federal response to the
Alaskan oil spill, the nation's worst such accident with nearly 11
million gallons of crude spilled in Prince William Sound.
   ``The federal response to the oil spill was woefully deficient,
and we must do something about it,'' Cowper said.
   ``We don't know how to clean up a major spill, ... and if we did
know how to clean it up, would we have the capability to do it? The
answer is no,'' Cowper said, asserting that current procedures lack
either a clear chain of command or assurance that cleanup equipment
will be available.
   Lujan replied that he agreed in general terms with Cowper's
criticisms. The governors unanimously adopted a resolution drafted
by Cowper to revamp their oil spill response to, among other things:
   _ Require that the Coast Guard maintain adequate emergency
cleanup plans and assure resources to carry them out for all ports
with oil spill risks.
   _ Provide guaranteed sources of money for immediate cleanup
efforts.
   _ Guarantee the states' rights to assess fees to support oil
spill cleanup supervision.
   _ Assure states the legal authority to set liability, and assess
penalties and damage claims.

<HEAD>IRA Suspects Charged in France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men and a woman suspected of belonging to the
Irish Republican Army were charged Tuesday with violating explosives
laws and involvement in terrorism, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse reported.
   It said the defendants, identified as Patrick Murray, Donnogh
O'Kane and Pauline Drunns, also were charged with counterfeiting and
falsifying documents. AFP said the case was assigned to
Investigating Magistrate Gilles Riviere of the special
anti-terrorism section.
   Scotland Yard in London said British police would have no comment
about the case. ``We are referring all calls to the French police;
it's their operation,'' a spokesman said.
   In Dublin, police linked a man and woman brought before the Irish
Republic's anti-terrorist Special Criminal Court on Tuesday with an
IRA unit operating on the continent and the three people charged in
Paris. Leonard Hardy, 28, and Donna Maguire, 22, were ordered held
in custody.
   Pierre Joxe, the French interior minister, said Monday the three
people were arrested in connection with security for last weekend's
Western economic summit in Paris and celebrations of the French
revolution bicentennial. He gave no details.
   Britain's domestic news agency, Press Association, said the three
told the Paris court they were members of the IRA and had no quarrel
with France.
   Charges and other pretrial criminal proceedings are supposed to
be kept secret under French law, but judicial sources often make
them known to courthouse reporters.
   In terrorism cases, the law allows police to hold people for
questioning for four days before bringing criminal charges. They
then can be held without bail pending trial.
   The AFP report said Murray, O'Kane and Ms. Drunns were arrested
Friday while driving on a superhighway in eastern France toward the
West German border. It said police suspected Murray, O'Kane and Ms.
Drunns of preparing attacks on British soldiers in West Germany.
   A search of the house where they were staying turned up false
passports, documents relating to British army bases in West Germany
and electronic gear that could be used for remote-control bomb
detonators, the agency said.
   Press Association said Murray had been sought since failing to
appear in court in Dublin in 1986 on charges relating to a shooting
there. It said he was known as ``The Pope'' because he has the words
``God Save The Pope'' tattooed on each forearm.
   Detective Inspector Kevin Carty told the court in Dublin that
Hardy and Ms. Maguire were arrested July 12 at Rosslare as they left
a ferry from Cherbourg, France.
   They were ``part of a group who were operating and engaged in
criminal activities'' outside the jurisdiction of Irish courts, the
inspector said.
   Hardy and Ms. Maguire are from Northern Ireland, where the IRA is
fighting to end British rule and unite the province with the
republic. The IRA is outlawed in both parts of Ireland.
   Carty said the Dublin defendants had false passports, explosives,
mercury switches that detonate bombs, photographs of a military base
and a telescopic rifle sight.

<TEXT>
   Two families and a 23-year-old man _
seven people in all _ escaped over border barriers Tuesday from
communist East Germany, Western border police reported.
   Two East German couples crossed the border with their sons, aged
5 and 8, in the Luechow-Dannenberg area 75 miles southeast of
Hamburg, said West German border police in Hanover.
   A police statement said one woman was slightly injured climbing a
steel mesh fence, but the other five members of the group were
unhurt and the escape apparently went unnoticed by East German
border guards.
   West German police in Kassel said a 23-year-old East German truck
driver escaped into Hesse state early Tuesday in the
Hersfeld-Rotenberg area 95 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   They said the young man was able to avoid East German border
guards even though he set off an acoustic alarm shortly before
climbing a steel mesh fence 10 feet high to reach West Germany.
   At least 10 East Germans have fled to the West in the past week.
   The Ministry of Inter-German Relations in Bonn said earlier in
July that 332 East Germans had crossed into West Berlin or West
Germany during the first six months of 1989. Last year, 590 escapes
were reported.

   A Venezuelan judge Tuesday charged
Economy Minister and former business executive Nestor Rapanelli with
misusing public funds in a multibillion-dollar foreign exchange
fraud.
   Rapanelli was sworn into office on Saturday to succeed Miguel
Roig, who died suddenly after serving less than a week.
   The allegation involved the overbilling of grain imports when
Rapanelli directed the Caracas offices of the Argentine grain
conglomerate Bunge and Born between 1985 and 1986.
   The purpose was to gain access to U.S. dollars provided by the
Venezuelan government at preferential, lower rates, said a spokesman
for Caracas Criminal Court Judge Luis Guillermo de La Riva.
   Rapanelli said he is innocent. ``My conscience is absolutely
calm,'' he told the government news agency Telam.
   Rapanelli, 60, said the charge initially was filed against him
and executives of four other grain trading companies in the
mid-1980s, and he was formally cleared in June 1988.
   President Carlos Menem, who took office on July 8, defended his
minister.
   ``It's a lie and it's going to end like all lies: buried by the
truth,'' Menem told reporters. ``We are going to defend him
totally.''
   Judge La Riva issued an order for Rapanelli's preventive
detention. The Venezuelan government, however, did not request his
extradition.
   In the scandal, a Venezuelan government agency known as Recadi
over five years distributed $40 billion for subsidized imports.
   Recadi was created in early 1983 as Venezuela's oil bonanza began
to fade and exchange restrictions were imposed. Cheap dollars were
lavishly granted via Recadi to private and public companies for
imports that otherwise would have fueled inflation.
   But of the $40 billion distributed, $6 billion is said to have
been granted fraudulently, mostly by overbilling, personal
connections or even outright bribery, contributing to the depletion
of the nation's monetary reserves.
   The scandal involved the executives of several multinational
companies, and nearly 50 arrest orders have been issued. Most
businessmen and government figures involved fled the country, many
before the warrants were issued. Only a dozen arrests have been
made, mostly of low-level company employees.
   No government figures have been detained, although several travel
prohibitions are pending against former finance ministers under the
previous government of president Jaime Lusinchi.
   La Riva has been accused of taking bribes in exchange for
juridical immunity for executives.

<HEAD>Education Reformers: Football Ruling Erodes Texas `No-Pass, No-Play'
Law</HEAD>

   Texas' education commissioner went too far in
overturning the grade of a high school football player and declaring
his team ineligible for the state championship trophy, a judge ruled
Tuesday.
   State District Judge Paul Davis Jr., in Austin, said Dallas'
Carter High School can keep its 1988 trophy despite a challenge to
the eligibility of running back Gary Edwards, and education
reformers fear the decision will undermine the state's ``no-pass,
no-play'' standard for student athletes.
   Last fall, state investigators found that Edwards had failed an
algebra class, which would have made the school ineligible for the
high school football playoffs under Texas' no-pass, no-play law.
   The principal at Carter High, in his own investigation, found the
teacher had miscalculated Edwards' grade and said he actually passed.
   The principal's finding was overturned by state Education
Commissioner William Kirby, but the Dallas school district got an
injunction from Davis allowing it to compete for the championship.
   The judge said the commissioner should not have interfered unless
the school abused its discretion in setting the grade.
   ``This court finds that it was improper for the state
commissioner of education to set the grade for an individual student
in an individual class,'' Davis wrote.
   The Texas Education Agency will appeal Davis' ruling. Kirby said
he believes the Carter principal did abuse his discretion by
altering the grade.
   Reformers say the ruling undermines efforts to set strict
eligibility standards for school athletics.
   ``It means that no-pass, no-play becomes no-pass, no-problem,''
said Lucius D. Bunton, attorney for the University Interscholastic
League, the state's governing body for high school athletics.
   The law, which prohibits students who fail a class from
participating in extracurricular activities, is a key part of
education reforms that Texas lawmakers approved in 1984.

<TEXT>
   A guerrilla organization seeking
independence for Namibia acknowledged Tuesday that some of its
members may have entered the territory but denied it was preparing a
large-scale incursion.
   Leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization told a
news conference that Louis Pienaar, administrator-general of
Namibia, told foreign diplomats Friday that 1,900 armed SWAPO
guerrillas were in Angola near Namibia's northern border and
appeared prepared to launch an incursion. Namibia also is known as
South-West Africa.
   SWAPO's international liaison officer, Theo-Ben Gurirab, said
small infiltrations by SWAPO members may be taking place.
   ``It is possible that there could be individuals or very small
groups of two or three in southern Angola or northern Namibia,'' he
said. ``It is possible. We are dealing with humans. But all ...
fighters have been instructed to return north of the 16th parallel''
in Angola.
   The dispute over possible guerrilla movements came as U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar arrived for three days of
meetings to assess progress of the U.N.-supervised independence plan
in Africa's last colony, ruled by South Africa for 74 years.
   ``Today (U.N.) Resolution 435 is being implemented in earnest,''
Perez de Cuellar said of the independence plan.
   ``I want to ensure that there will conditions for the holding of
free and fair elections,'' he said in a brief statement upon arrival
at the Windhoek airport from Lisbon, Portugal.
   He said ``critical problems remain'' but did not elaborate.
   Perez de Cuellar did not mention the allegations that SWAPO might
be planning to invade Namibia or Gurirab's accusation that Pienaar
was creating war hysteria.
   Jacobus Venter, of Namibia's Foreign Affairs Department, said
military intelligence indicated SWAPO guerrillas, in groups ranging
from 80 to 480, were massed in more than a dozen locations just
north of the Namibian-Angolan border.
   In a letter Friday to the top United Nations official in Namibia,
Martti Ahtisaari, Venter said the groups ``were armed, wearing
uniforms, and had taken their rucksacks and equipment with them.''
   A copy of the letter also was sent to several foreign observer
missions in Namibia, including the United States, the Soviet Union,
France, West Germany and Britain.
   A joint SWAPO-U.N. delegation, with Angolan and Tanzanian
observers, traveled to northern Namibia on Saturday to investigate
the allegations. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard reported Monday no
evidence was found of infiltrations or large-scale concentrations of
SWAPO fighters.
   Pienaar also said in a statement issued Monday that ``the
situation was calm and under full control on both sides of the
border.''
   Gurirab denied there was an impending invasion and called the
report an attempt by the administration to malign SWAPO.
   ``As a result of this war hysteria, several heads of state and
government were awakened to be informed of an imminent crisis facing
the Namibian independence process,'' he told the news conference.
   Under the U.N. independence plan for Namibia, SWAPO guerrillas
are allowed to return as unarmed refugees to take part in the
November elections, which SWAPO is favored to win after fighting a
23-year guerrilla war against South African forces.
   However, armed guerrillas are to remain at SWAPO bases north of
the 16th parallel, about 100 miles north of the Namibian border.
   Namibia's South African administration claims SWAPO guerrillas
are south of that line but SWAPO's statement said, ``There is no
SWAPO military presence south of the 16th parallel or in the
northern part of this country.''

   Cuban officials say they have talked with a top
State Department official about opening a dialogue on joint efforts
to combat drug trafficking, a congressman said Tuesday.
   The announcement by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the
House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, comes less
than a week after Cuban leader Fidel Castro criticized the United
States for failing to warn him of Cuban military involvement in
cocaine trafficking and the execution of four Cuban officers for
that illegal activity.
   Rangel said he met Tuesday with Jose Antonio Arbesu Fraga, the
new chief of the Cuban Interests Section _ the Cuban substitute for
an embassy, attached formally to the Czechoslovakian Embassy _ and
Arbesu's assistant chief, Manuel Davis.
   The Cubans told him they ``have talked with the State Department
and told them that Cuba is waiting to see how Havana can better
establish a dialogue, because no matter what the political
differences are, no one can allow the drug traffickers to take
advantage,'' Rangel said.
   They also told him they had told Michael Kozak, deputy assistant
secretary of State for inter-American affairs, that they are
``willing to cooperate in any international anti-drug venture,''
Rangel said.
   Although the exact date of the meeting was not revealed, a Rangel
aide noted that Arbesu only became chief of the Cuban Interests
Section in June.
   A State Department official said Tuesday evening, ``Mr. Kozak's
met with Cuban representatives many times over the years,'' and that
Kozak has met Arbesu. This official declined to confirm or deny that
the specific meeting in question had taken place, or what might have
been discussed.
   ``We have raised narcotics with the Cubans on many, many
occasions over the years,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   However, he refused to say whether the State Department had
discussed cooperative anti-drug efforts with the Cubans or simply
criticized them for involvement in drug trafficking, accusations
that have been leveled repeatedly by the United States.
   ``We certainly think there's ample room for the Cubans to take
action,'' he said. ``We're looking for deeds rather than just
words.''
   When the United States says it is looking for deeds, it's talking
about ``interdicting drugs, stopping the flow over their
territory,'' he added.
   He declined to comment on the recent execution of four Cuban
military officers for drug trafficking.
   People who answered the phone at the Cuban Interests Section late
Tuesday afternoon said Arbesu and Davis were both gone for the day
and no one else was available to speak on the matter.
   Last week, Castro told the Cuban Council of State in a four-hour
speech, ``We need some way to communicate in this common battle. We
need to talk to the Americans about how to manage this situation.''
   The Cuban leader also rebuked the United States, saying it had
``at least two names'' of military officers involved in a
cocaine-trafficking conspiracy long before contacts in Colombia
alerted Cuban officials.
   A hero of the Cuban revolution who was a trusted advisor to
Castro, Army Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, and three other
military officers were executed last Thursday for smuggling tons of
drugs into the United States.
   The drug scandal stunned and embarrassed Castro and his communist
government, which for years denied U.S. accusations that Cuba was
being used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana.
   Last December, Rangel led a congressional delegation to Cuba and
met with Castro for five hours.
   Before he left, State Department and Drug Enforcement
Administration officials told Rangel that there was no official or
unofficial cooperation with Cuba on drugs, although there had been
communications on other topics, a Rangel aide said.
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard abruptly canceled a closed briefing of
Rangel's committee regarding U.S.-Cuban drug cooperation that had
been scheduled for early Tuesday morning, the congressman said.
   Rangel said Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost called him late
Monday to cancel the meeting, saying ``changing developments'' were
responsible.
   ``If there are new developments, why can't they be told to the
Congress?'' Rangel asked.
   ``I can only conclude until I am informed otherwise that
administration anti-communist zealots stopped this briefing, which
could have shown the Congress how the United States and Cuba can
work together to stop the common enemy of drugs,'' he said.

   A replica of a Civil War-era sailing ship
became trapped in ice in the North Atlantic and later sank in rough
seas, but the seven crew members were rescued, the ship's builder
said.
   The Sheila Yeates, a topsail ketch with an oak frame and a
50-foot deck, left Duluth on May 15 through the Great Lakes and St.
Lawrence Seaway bound for Cornwall, England.
   It was one of the tall ships that commemorated the U.S.
Bicentennial and had made numerous other voyages since then,
including one in 1985 from Duluth to Greenland, but this was to have
been its first Atlantic crossing.
   Geoffrey Pope, 76, of Excelsior, who built and skippered the
ship, gave an account of the ship's last voyage and sinking to
friends in the Minneapolis area Monday from aboard the Danish shrimp
boat Kiviuq, which plowed through ice and dense fog Friday to save
the crew.
   ``I feel very responsible,'' Pope said. ``I lost the ship. But
aside from that, I feel such a reaffirmation of the potential ... of
the bond that exists between men in extremus.''
   Pope said the voyage went smoothly until Thursday, at a point
about 80 miles south of Greenland's Point Farwell, when they
encountered ice farther south than expected.
   The ship was soon engulfed in thick fog and surrounded by massive
chunks of ice with no room to maneuver. The shifting ice would have
crushed the wooden ship, Pope said.
   ``A lifeboat wouldn't have survived for two seconds,'' he said.
``It was kind of a mental hell. There was no escape. This was the
end.''
   Early Friday, the crew awakened Pope and urged him to radio a
mayday appeal for help.
   The Kiviuq, which fishes in the Arctic and is equipped with
ice-breaking equipment, responded and found the Sheila Yeates within
hours.
   The trawler freed the sailing vessel and towed it 430 miles.
   Pope said he thought the ship could be repaired within a month,
but that was before rough water made the ship take on water. It was
finally cut loose and sank Monday, he told fellow sailing enthusiast
Tim Carlson of Plymouth.
   The Sheila Yeates was designed by Robert Jackson of Hopkins, and
was built in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. It was launched a month before
OpSail, the July 1976 sailing extravaganza in New York Harbor.
   More than a dozen investors sank $150,000 into the vessel just to
get it launched, six times their original estimates. It was insured
for $150,000 by Lloyds of London, less than one-third what it would
cost to replace it, according to Pope.

<HEAD>Angola Expected to Join IMF Despite US Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola was expected to become the 152nd member
of the International Monetary Fund despite an announcement by the
State Department on Tuesday that the United States voted against it.
   ``The U.S. has made clear that it could not support Angolan
membership in the fund at this time and we voted against the
membership resolution,'' the State Department said.
   The United States has strong influence in the fund, but less than
19 percent of the voting power. International monetary sources, who
spoke on condition they not be quoted, said none of the other
members has indicated that it would vote against the southwest
African country.
   One source said the United States was apparently willing to let
itself be outvoted and that a strong U.S. position against Angola
could have delayed consideration.
   A spokesman for the fund said he could make no statement now,
that an announcement would come in about a week. The last votes are
due by telex Wednesday at the fund's headquarters in Washington.
   Approval of Angola's membership in the fund would normally clear
the way for it also to become the 152nd member of the fund's sister
organization, the World Bank.
   U.S. administrations have opposed fund membership for Angola,
because of its Marxist government, and supported the rebel Unita
movement of Jonas Savimbi. On June 22 Savimbi and the government of
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos agreed on a cease-fire.
   The fund's basic job is to keep currencies stable. To do that, it
makes loans -- in recent years, largely to Third World countries.
The borrowing governments promise in return to make belt-tightening
changes in policy so as to put their economies into better shape to
repay.
   Some of these changes have resulted in hardships for their
people. Devaluation of a borrowing country's currency, which the
fund often calls for, makes imported goods more expensive. Cuts in
government spending, another frequent requirement, often result in
cuts of subsidies on food and other basic articles and consequently
high prices for consumers.
   Riots earlier this year in Venezuela and Jordan were linked to
policies undertaken at the fund's suggestion.
   Fund officials say that unless borrowing governments adopt such
policies, their overall situation will grow even worse.
   Increasingly the World Bank has made similar ``structural
adjustment'' loans. But the bulk of its lending is for specific
projects, such as schools, roads, farming and health care, which
contribute directly to raising a country's standard of living.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Tuesday he was offended by
Republican advisers who portrayed Dan Quayle as a campaign disaster
who had to be protected from his own political ineptitude.
   In a new book by Jules Witcover and Jack Germond, several
consultants to last year's Bush-Quayle election campaign depict the
vice presidential candidate as a lightweight who was not ready for
the national political scene.
   One of the ``handlers'' employed by the Bush team to manage
Quayle's campaign travels, Joseph Canzeri, said the former Indiana
senator was tough to work with because he had a limited attention
span, the ``impatience of youth.''
   ``He's a fairly quick study, but about what he wants to hear,''
Canzeri was quoted as saying in the book, ``Whose Broad Stripes and
Bright Stars? The Trivial Pursuit of the Presidency 1988.''
   ``If he doesn't like it, he goes away from it. ... He was like a
kid. Ask him to turn off a light, and by the time he gets to the
switch, he's forgotten what he went for.''
   Canzeri said the handlers ``knew we were going to have to script
him.''
   The book also indicates that James Lake, the former Reagan
campaign press secretary who advised Quayle, was dismayed at some of
Quayle's remarks on television as controversy about his Vietnam-era
National Guard service heightened.
   At one point, when the campaign wanted Quayle to refrain from
answering questions so as not to overshadow Bush's convention
acceptance speech, Lake said Quayle ``wanted to answer those
questions. I just pushed him aside.''
   Bush, asked about the comments of Canzeri and other former
campaign operatives, said Tuesday that he found them ``personally
offensive.''
   ``That's the ugly side of politics,'' he said.
   He told reporters flying home from the Netherlands with him
aboard Air Force One that Quayle has been an effective vice
president.
   Quayle, traveling in California, said Tuesday he found it
``rather a cruel hoax that some of your top advisers would speak
like that behind your back. It's most unfortunate. That probably
explains a lot of the problems we had on the campaign. But that's
behind us.''
   Quayle made his comments during an impromptu news conference at
San Diego's Miramar Naval Air Station.
   He told reporters in Los Angeles on Monday that it was a
``critical mistake'' to rely on the advice of his handlers. ``If I
had it to do over again I'd do it differently. I would have been a
lot more accessible to the press from the outset. I wouldn't have
allowed myself to be in that controlled situation. I share the
blame. I could have told them to go to hell but I didn't,'' press
secretary David Beckwith quoted his boss as saying.
   Bush cited the vice president's two diplomatic trips to Latin
America for the new administration as examples of his merit, along
with his chairmanship of the national Space Council and his
contributions to Bush's morning briefings.
   ``He's a good man and he deserves something better than a
post-mortem kick in the .... ankles,'' the president said.
   ``My judgment has been vindicated. He is serious. He is doing a
first class job,'' Bush said.
   The Germond-Witcover book, which concerns the entire presidential
campaign, not just Quayle's part, deals with Quayle as a candidate
rather than as vice president.
   Political pros quoted as belittling his abilities included Stuart
Spencer, former adviser to Republican presidential candidates and a
California-based political consultant.
   Canzeri asked Spencer why he let a rebellious Quayle scrap his
text and deliver his own rambling speech on defense at one Chicago
appearance.
   Spencer used an obscene metaphor to state that he wanted Quayle
to foul up in public, and ``then we'll own him again.''
   After his debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle was widely criticized for comparing himself to
the late President Kennedy as a young man who won national office.
   Canzeri quoted Quayle adviser Mitch Daniels, a former White House
political director, as moaning, ``We told him not to get into that.''
   Daniels, in a telephone interview Tuesday, acknowledged campaign
advisers had agreed it would be inadvisable to bring up such a
comparison.
   But Daniels, who was on the road full time with Quayle, said he
did not agree with the tenor of criticisms from those quoted in the
book, saying, ``Their view of this is 180 degrees wrong.
   GOP consultant Ed Rollins, also a former White House political
director, is quoted in the book as saying that had the Bush forces
received an honest reading from GOP senators on Quayle as a possible
vice presidential candidate, they would have been told he was a
``lightweight.''
   Rollins was quoted as saying the campaign would have heard the
same from ``any group of political reporters or any group of
political people in this town.''
   Beckwith said in his boss' defense that Quayle has built a
reputation in Washington as ``a serious respected, effective vice
president.'' He said, ``The word is a little slower getting out to
the general public around the country.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle said Tuesday the
United States should commit itself to exploring and developing space
and that Congress should fully fund construction of a manned space
station.
   ``The president and I are committed to American leadership in
exploration, understanding, economic use and, yes, eventual
settlement in space,'' he said in an address to 4,000 employees of
General Dynamics Space Systems Division.
   ``We Americans have been pushing back frontiers throughout
history. Today, space is America's frontier,'' said Quayle,
appointed chairman of the National Space Council by President Bush.
   Quayle likened the first manned Apollo landing on the moon in
1969 to Columbus' discovery of the New World.
   ``The time is now at hand for Americans to be preparing for the
equivalent of 1620, the year Pilgrims landed on the shore of
Plymouth Bay and settled the New World,'' Quayle said.
   He addressed the employees after touring the plant, where General
Dynamics is building Titan Centaur rockets for use as launch
vehicles.
   Quayle said the expense of establishing colonies on the moon and
Mars would be returned many times over in the development of new
industry and jobs and the expansion of knowledge.
   ``Space is a high-yield investment,'' he said, and also urged
Congress to approve full funding for the National Aeronautic and
Space Administration's proposal to build a space station.
   Quayle said President Bush would go into more specifics about the
administration's space policy Thursday, when Bush delivers an
address to mark the 20th anniversary of America's first manned lunar
landing.
   ``We cannot afford not to go forward in space,'' Quayle said.
``Unfortunately, in the past couple of decades we've had somewhat of
a status quo approach to space. We've got to do better than that.''
   During his stay in San Diego, Quayle also visited Qualcomm, a
high-technology firm in Sorrento Valley, and met with business
leaders and officials from the University of California at San Diego.
   At Qualcomm, he used a satellite communications system to send
greetings to 4,500 truckers nationwide whose rigs are equipped with
OmniTRACS, messaging and position reporting computers.
   ``Congratulations on your use of high technology to enhance the
competitive position of the industry,'' Quayle told the truckers.

   He came, he saw, he spent ... and spent ... and
spent. Cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder has already dished out a record
$8.5 million in his mayoral bid, but the profits from makeup haven't
covered his campaign woes.
   ``He's got something none of the other candidates will ever have:
a very, very, very wealthy mother,'' political adviser Roger Ailes,
a former Lauder campaign worker, observed early in the candidate's
campaign.
   Lauder's mother is Estee Lauder, head of the cosmetics empire
that bears her name.
   Months later, that remains Lauder's one big advantage.
   In a year where the mayoral race is wide open, almost no one
gives Lauder a chance. Recent polls show former U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani crushing Lauder in the Republican primary. The
projections in the November general election, in which Lauder will
be on the Conservative Party line, are even uglier.
   ``Sure thing: Ron Lauder will lose by a margin so large he won't
be tempted to demand a recount,'' predicted Daily News columnist
Bill Reel.
   Lauder and Giuliani are vying for the chance to unseat Democratic
Mayor Edward I. Koch. So are Democrats Manhattan Borough President
David Dinkins, City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and former
Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Richard Ravitch.
   Yet Lauder, 44, continues undaunted, airing more and more
commercials, determined to continue his conservative,
pro-death-penalty campaign.
   Giuliani has ripped Lauder as an incompetent who ``never worked
for a living.'' Lauder has responded by calling Giuliani a liberal
in TV commercials.
   Lauder has spent $85 for each of the 100,000 or so Republicans
expected to vote in the Sept. 12 primary, double the total of five
other mayoral contenders combined.
   ``This is my money. I earned it honestly and I owe no one,''
Lauder said after Monday's revelation about his campaign spending.
``There won't be any favors to be called in with the Lauder
administration.''
   But a Lauder administration would have to overcome these bumps on
the campaign trail:
   _On a radio appearance, Lauder couldn't say how many members the
City Council has. It has 35.
   _His agenda for change included firing the schools chancellor.
The mayor has no power to do this.
   Asked why, Lauder said the incumbent hadn't done much for the
past couple of years. The incumbent had been in office for one year.
   _A recent news conference in the South Bronx was quickly changed
to a ``fact-finding tour'' when only one reporter showed up. Lauder
entertained his audience of one by incorrectly identifying the
surrounding neighborhood.

   President Bush declared parts of Texas and
Louisiana major disaster areas Tuesday as a result of the havoc
wreaked there last month by Tropical Storm Allison.
   The White House announced the disaster declarations shortly after
Bush's return from a 10-day trip to Europe.
   Nine Texas counties were made eligible for federal aid: Hardin,
Harris, Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Newton, Orange, San Jacinto and
Tyler.
   In Louisiana, the parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, East
Baton Rouge, Grant, Iberville, Natchitoches, Pointe Coupee, Rapides
and Winn were made eligible for help.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency will handle the
assistance, which can include temporary housing, grants, low-cost
loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help
the areas recover from the storm and its flooding.
   FEMA named Graham L. Nance as federal coordinating officer for
the recovery in Texas, and Robert D. Broussard for Louisiana. Both
work out of the regional FEMA office in Denton, Texas.
   Bush later declared Connecticut eligible for disaster aid to help
it recover from the severe storms, winds and tornadoes that struck
the western part of the state beginning July 10.
   The declaration will provide relief for individuals and local
governments in the counties of New Haven and Litchfield.
   Albert A. Gammal Jr. of FEMA's Boston regional officer was
appointed to coordinate the federal recovery operations.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has postponed a state
visit scheduled for next week due to ``the sensitive phase'' of the
Arab League's efforts to settle the strife in Lebanon, the White
House said Tuesday.
   The visit will be rescheduled sometime after Sept. 1, it said.
   Bush had planned to hold a state dinner for Fahd on July 27.
   In a brief statement, the White House said:
   ``King Fahd of Saudi Arabia called President Bush to request that
the state visit scheduled for later this month be postponed due to
the sensitive phase of the mediation on the Lebanese situation by
the Heads of State Committee of which the king is a member.
   ``The president expressed his understanding as well as his wishes
for the success of the committee's effort to bring peace and
stability to Lebanon. Both leaders agreed that the state visit would
take place as soon as could be arranged after Sept. 1.''
   The Arab League is attempting to negotiate a truce in Lebanon
between Syrian-backed Druze forces and Christian militia and to spur
major political reforms in the embattled country.
   Bush was briefed on the initiative at the White House June 14 by
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud Al-Faisal.
   The league, at a summit meeting in Morocco in May, gave King
Fahd, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algeria's President Chadli
Bendjedid the task of trying to arrange within six months a
ceasefire and a blueprint for lasting political reforms in Lebanon.
   Fifteen foreigners are thought to be held hostage in Lebanon,
nine of them Americans, including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press.

<HEAD>EDS: UPDATES in top 15 grafs with Justice Department acknowledging
that Lucas gave inaccurate answers on 1981 bar application; remaineder

<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

   William Lucas, nominated to be the Bush
administration's civil rights chief, gave inaccurate answers on a
sworn application to be admitted to the New York bar, the Justice
Department acknowledged Tuesday.
   The admission came to light as Lucas was administered a sharp
snub by his home state's two senators, who said they would not
introduce him to the Senate Judiciary Committee at the opening of
hearings Wednesday on his nomination to be assistant attorney
general for civil rights.
   Justice Department spokesman Deborah Burstion-Wade confirmed that
the black Republican from Michigan failed to state on the New York
form in 1981 that he had once failed the District of Columbia bar
exam. His application to New York was successful.
   Lucas, 61, simply stated that he was admitted to the Michigan bar
in 1971 when asked if he had ever taken another state bar
examination or applied to practice in another state.
   Lucas also answered in the negative when he was asked if he had
ever been a witness in a civil or criminal court proceeding, when in
fact he had testified numerous times, Ms. Burstion-Wade confirmed.
   Ms. Burstion-Wade acknowledged inaccuracies on the New York state
bar application but said ``I don't see that they negaate four
decades of public service.''
   ``There is no intention here to mislead,'' she said, adding that
she was not trying ``belittle'' or ``make light'' of the
inaccuracies.
   ``There is no concern about his honesty, or his ethics,'' Ms.
Burstion-Wade said. ``The man's background is just too admirable.''
   But she acknowledged that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and
his top aides were not aware of Lucas' inaccurate answers until last
week.
   The New York bar application could become an issue in conjunction
with the fact that Lucas stated on resumes and in court testimony
that he had been a Justice Department attorney in 1963 when in fact
he was a legal assistant, not a lawyer.
   Lucas was forced to leave the department when he failed the D.C.
bar examination. He joined the FBI, later becoming sheriff of Wayne
County, Michigan, which includes Detroit, and after that county
executive.
   In signing the New York form, Lucas swore to the accuracy and
truth of his answers. His signature was witnessed by a notary public.
   Earlier in the day, Ms. Burstion-Wade had said Lucas had given a
truthful answer to the question about whether he had ever been a
court witness, saying ``the application was filed in his personal
capacity as an attorney. In that capacity, he was never a witness.''
   Confronted with more details about the form, Ms. Burstion-Wade
acknowledged the inaccuracies and said she had not seen the form
when she gave her initial response.
   Lucas' nomination is opposed by a number of civil rights
organizations who say he lacks the professional legal experience to
head the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Michigan's two Democratic senators, Carl Levin and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., broke the Senate's usual practice by declining to
introduce Lucas to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Nominees most often receive the courtesy of an introduction from
home-state senators at confirmation hearings, regardless of party
differences and sometimes even the intention to oppose the nominee.
   Levin said in a statement he wanted ``to consider the Judiciary
Committee proceedings as part of my decision on the Lucas nomination
because an introduction of a nominee generally implies that one has
already decided to recommend the nominee.''
   Riegle also sent word he would not introduce Lucas, saying
through a spokeswoman that he had concerns about the nominee's
qualifications.
   ``It would have been desirable for them to have come, but I
wouldn't read to much into it,'' said David Runkel, an assistant to
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Civil rights groups including the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights have been opposed to Lucas, a one-time Democrat who lost a
Republican race for governor of Michigan in 1986.
   Lucas was to be followed as a witness by former Circuit Judge
Victor Baum, who in 1976 sat on a panel that held Lucas in contempt
of court for failing to ease crowding in the Wayne County Jail when
he was sheriff.
   That panel found ``culpability'' on the part of Lucas for ``his
deliberate and unilateral election to disobey the judgement and
orders of the Circuit Court.'' The judges imposed $250 fines for
each of several violations after finding Lucas had ignored a 1972
order to improve jail conditions.
   Critics also have been focusing on a U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals finding in 1985 that Lucas failed to investigate police
brutality charges in the 1976 beating of a jail prisoner named
Salvatore Marchese.
   The panel said this ``served to confirm the existence of an
unstated policy of toleration of illegal brutality.''
   ``I think that what it demonstrates is that Lucas is the wrong
person for this job by any measure,'' said Arthur Kropp, president
of of People for the American Way, a group that is fighting the
nomination.
   Lucas would succeed William Bradford Reynolds, whose tenure was
marked by constant friction with civil rights groups.

   The Senate on Tuesday brushed aside complaints
that President Bush is packing the ranks of the nation's envoys with
unqualified political cronies and defeated a bid to restrict
political appointments to 15 percent of the diplomatic corps.
   The vote rejecting an amendment by Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., was
79-20.
   Gore said he would try again Wednesday and offered an amendment
to hold to 30 percent the number of ambassadors and senior State
Department officials nominated for their political contributions.
   Gore said the higher percentage was more in keeping with the
average of political appointments in recent administrations.
   He said he also will seek to rally opposition against nominees
whose non-political qualifications to represent the United States
abroad are thin.
   Arguing for the more restrictive 15 percent level, Gore and other
Democrats said two-thirds of the 42 ambassadorial nominations
submitted by Bush can be classified as political.
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other senators contended that
the proposed restriction would represent an unwarranted and
unconstitutional intrusion on the president's ability to conduct
foreign policy.
   Gore said the political appointments undermine the U.S. Foreign
Service, damage its morale and represent ``an abuse for which there
is no justification.''
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said the 14 career Foreign Service
officers nominated as ambassadors by Bush represent by far the
lowest level in any of the last six presidential administrations.
   In general, career diplomats received 60 percent or more of
ambassadorships, Sarbanes said.
   ``This is a marked, radical change,'' Sarbanes said. ``This is a
vast departure from a pattern followed by previous administrations,
Republican and Democratic alike.''
   It is a departure ``so outrageous,'' Sarbanes said, ``that
something has to be done about it.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the ranking Republican member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the right of the
president to nominate whoever he chooses as ambassador ``should not
be prohibited by law.''
   ``We are intruding on the foreign policy authority of the
president,'' Helms said.
   But Gore disagreed.
   ``This practice has reached the point where the Foreign Service
is curtailing prematurely the careers of increasing numbers of its
finest diplomats,'' Gore said.
   ``We've created a game of musical chairs in which the
professionals _ the core of expertise and continuity modern
diplomatic life demands _ lose out,'' he said.
   The 20 senators voting for the amendment to restrict political
appointees were John B. Breaux, D-La.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; Quentin
Burdick, D-N.D.; Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.;
James Exon, D-Neb.; Wendell Ford, D-Ky.; Albert Gore, D-Tenn.;
Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Patrick J.
Leahy, D-Vt.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio;
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; Larry Pressler,
R-S.D.; David Pryor, D-Ark.; Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.; Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn.; and Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, did not vote.

   FBI Director William S. Sessions on Tuesday
filled the bureau's long-vacant No. 2 position by promoting
Executive Assistant Director Floyd I. Clarke to be his deputy
director.
   Clarke's promotion caps a meteoric rise in the ranks of the FBI's
high command. Clarke, 47, was named an executive assistant director
in February, making him equal in rank to Oliver B. Revell, once
mentioned as a possible director of the bureau, and John E. Otto.
   In announcing a realignment of the top FBI executive positions,
Sessions said that Otto would become associate deputy director for
administration and Revell associate deputy director for
investigations.
   The realignment was made to meet ``increasingly complex
responsibilities and the need to meet future challenges,'' Sessions
said in a statement.
   Sessions said that as deputy director, Clarke has the authority
to resolve management issues across divisional lines and will chair
the bureau's Senior Executive Service selection board.
   Clarke, Otto and Revell will continue to be part of the
director's advisory board on strategy, policy and planning, Sessions
said.
   Revell, 50, was criticized by some members of Congress for his
defense of the FBI's controversial surveillance of the Committee In
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES) in the early
1980s.
   Revell's defense of the operation came several months before
Sessions acknowledged on Capitol Hill last year that the bureau had
overstepped its bounds by gathering intelligence on domestic
political organizations.
   Six FBI officials were disciplined as a result of the CISPES
investigation. No action was taken against Revell.
   Revell will continue to oversee criminal investigations, foreign
counterintelligence and counterterrorism programs as well as the FBI
laboratory.
   Clarke, who had been a protege of Revell, was named deputy
assistant director of the criminal investigative division in 1982
and became assistant director for criminal investigations in 1985.
   Previously, he had headed the FBI's Philadelphia field office and
had served as an administrative assistant to the attorney general
during the Ford administration.
   The No. 2 position, officially known as the associate director,
has been vacant since the early 1980s with the retirement of James
B. Adams.

<UNK>Report Bush Urged Shamir to Give Up `Greater Israel'</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wrote a letter to Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir echoing the statement of Secretary of State
James A. Baker III that the idea of a ``greater Israel'' should be
abandoned, National Public Radio said Tuesday.
   Baker's exhortation, contained in a speech May 22, was attacked
by friends of Israel in Congress.
   The network said the president endorsed Baker's call on Israel to
give up any idea of annexation of the West Bank of the Jordan River,
occupied by Israeli troops since 1967, to stop new settlements in
that territory and to reopen Palestinian schools.
   At the White House, spokesman Robert Hall declined to say
anything about a letter from the president but added: ``That all
sounds like U.S. policy.''
   Reporter Daniel Schorr said the letter, sent at the end of June,
reiterated U.S. opposition to creating a Palestinian state, support
for secure Israeli borders, an undivided Jerusalem and assurance
that Israel's military advantage over its Arab enemies would be kept.
   He added it was designed, at the suggestion of 11 leaders in the
U.S. Senate, to help Shamir resist opposition within his own Likud
Party against the plan for an election in the disputed area of
representatives who would then negotiate with the Israeli government.
   Shamir then made a speech adopting conditions urged by other
Likud leaders: continued Jewish settlements in the area and a ban on
participation in the election by Palestinians living in Jerusalem.
   The conditions brought a threat from the Israeli Labor party to
pull out of Israel's coalition government.

   An unsealed tunnel leading from a storage
tank leaked up to 640,000 gallons of oil Tuesday, and nearly 300
gallons spilled into a waterway that leads to the Atlantic Ocean,
officials said.
   ``It wasn't sealed and why it wasn't sealed is something we are
looking into,'' said Coast Guard Capt. Robert C. North.
   Between 420,000 and 640,000 gallons of oil poured from the tank,
but most of it was contained on land by a system of earthen dikes,
said the Coast Guard and the state Department of Environmental
Protection.
   ``There's no threat to people,'' said North. ``We're concerned
about the environment if the tank should rupture.''
   Environmental department spokesman Gary Allen said the oil in the
water was confined to a 20-foot-by-80-foot area and was no more then
10 feet out to sea.
   Workers were vacuuming the oil from the Arthur Kill, the narrow
waterway separating New Jersey from the New York City borough of
Staten Island, using absorbent booms.
   ``It is free-flowing oil, so it should not take more then a day
to clean up,'' Allen said. He said the oil was fuel oil No. 6.
   The spill was reported at a tank owned by Northville Industries.
The tank is one of four near the edge of the Arthur Kill.
   North said the tunnel from which the oil leaked is used to carry
fuel from the storage tanks to barges and ships. Workers put a
makeshift clay seal at the mouth of the tunnel to cut seepage.
   Coast Guard spokesman Paul Milligan said the tank, which has a
capacity of 12.6 million gallons, was nearly full. The remaining oil
was transferred to other tanks and to barges.
   John Reiff, general manager at the Northville plant, said the
tank is 18 years old and was last inspected 7{ years ago.

   A group calling itself the ``Blood-Bright Dare to
Die Squad'' says it will kill two Japanese each month because their
nation collaborates with China's government, the Japanese Embassy
said Tuesday.
   A letter in Chinese mailed to the Japan Airlines office in
Beijing also said citizens of other countries would be killed if
they collaborated with the regime.
   Police continued rounding up participants in pro-democracy
protests that ended with the army crackdown June 3-4. Reports
Tuesday said journalist Dai Qing and Yang Wei, a recently freed
dissident linked to a Chinese group in New York, were arrested.
   Ms. Dai, a reporter for the Guangming Daily, was a leader in a
democracy movement among intellectuals last fall. After students
took to the streets in April demanding reforms she signed several
petitions to the government.
   Her husband, reached by telephone, said plainclothes police
arrived at their home during dinner Thursday and led her away. He
said he had not heard from her since.
   It was the first known arrest of a journalist involved in the
protests. Hundreds of journalists marched and signed petitions for
press freedom, and are said to be required now to write
self-criticisms.
   Xinhua, the official news agency, said Shanghai police arrested
Yang on Tuesday for allegedly ``conducting demagogical propaganda
for counterrevolutionary ends.'' Yang, 33, was jailed from 1987
until January on similar charges.
   While studying in the United States in 1985, he wrote articles
for a journal published by the China Alliance for Democracy, an
expatriate group seeking political reform.
   More than 2,060 arrests were reported in China in the first weeks
after the June 3-4 crackdown. Official reports of arrests have been
rare recently, but unofficial ones from families and friends
continue.
   Chinese sources say arrests have exceeded 2,000 in Beijing alone.
   The Chinese government said 200-300 people were killed in the
military attack on protesters in June, but Western diplomats and
Chinese sources said the death toll may have reached 3,000.
   A local official of Japan Airlines said the company had not
decided whether to take special security precautions because of the
letter received Monday.
   It said: ``Because the Japanese pirates collude with the
Communist Party dictatorial government and plot to launch a
large-scale economic invasion of China, from today we, the
Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad, enter into a state of war with the
Japanese pirates.''
   Two Japanese businessmen, tourists or people considered friends
of China's ruling party will be killed each month beginning Aug. 15,
the letter said. It made no specific demands, but said the killings
would increase next year to one a week if Japan did not ``repent.''
   ``Please tell other countries, if they collude with the
dictatorial government, they will meet the same fate,'' the letter
concluded.
   ``We don't know how serious this is,'' said Hideo Watanabe, first
secretary of the Japanese Embassy.
   The letter's tone and terminology suggested links to the student
movement. Students and supporters in many cities formed ``dare to
die squads'' during the pro-democracy campaign and there has been
speculation some would go underground.
   When dynamite exploded on a Shanghai-bound train June 26, killing
24 people, authorities said they suspected sabotage. Results of a
police investigation have not been released, but the government
later issued emergency orders for tighter security to stop ``the
enemy from blowing up and sabotaging railway facilities.''
   China has no known terrorist organizations. Acts of sabotage are
reported from time to time, but usually are attributed to
disgruntled individuals.
   Official controls and supervision extend to many aspects of daily
life, making it difficult for an underground organization to operate.
   Watanabe said about 1,000 Japanese are in Beijing, roughly half
the number living in the capital before political turmoil caused
many foreigners to leave.
   Some Japanese businessmen have returned, but express reservations
about future investment. Their government has halted high-level
contacts with China and frozen development aid.
   In the only other known case of a terrorist threat to foreigners,
authorities told the U.S. Embassy in June 1988 that nationals of a
third country planned to attack Americans in Beijing.
   China said several days later the danger had passed, but gave no
public explanation. The third country was not identified.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry has asked Chinese authorities to ``take
special care to ensure the safety of Japanese people in China,'' a
ministry official in Tokyo said.
   In another development in Tokyo the Foreign Ministry told a
Chinese envoy that although Japan joined six other industrialized
democracies at last week's summit in Paris in criticizing the
government crackdown, it hopes to resume cooperative relations with
China.
   Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Tadashi Ikeda, a Foreign
Ministry official, met with Tang Jiaxuan, China's charge d'affaires
in Tokyo.
   The spokesman said Ikeda told Tang that Japan ``cannot accept the
use of military force against citizens in China from the
humanitarian point of view. Therefore, our relations with China are
naturally restrained.''
   But Taizo Watanabe said Japan does not want China to be isolated
and that Ikeda told the envoy, ``We will be ready to resume
cooperative relations when China's response and international public
opinion have improved.''
   Tang echoed the Chinese government's denunciation of the
communique issued at the Paris summit, according to Taizo Watanabe.
He said Tang told Ikeda the criticism was a ``violent intervention
in domestic politics which ignores the facts.''
   Tang also said the Chinese policy of developing friendly
relations with foreign countries and its economic reforms remain
unchanged, the spokesman said.

   A daughter of a Newsday editor was found
dead in her home Tuesday, and police said she apparently had been
killed.
   The body of Lea Greene, 35, daughter of Newsday Assistant
Managing Editor Bob Greene, was found in her apartment by a neighbor
shortly before 9 a.m., Suffolk County police spokesman Randy Jared
said.
   The victim was in her bedroom and wearing nightclothes.
   ``We have definitely ruled out suicide,'' said Detective Sergeant
Kevin Cronin. ``This is a homicide we are investigating.''
   Cronin would not comment on what caused Ms. Greene's death. He
said there were no signs of a sexual assault. Jared said no weapons
were found in the house and there were no signs of a break-in.
   Ms. Greene, who was single and lived alone, was a nurse at
Community Hospital of Western Suffolk in Smithtown.
   Her father headed two teams that won Pulitzer Prizes. In 1970,
his team investigated political corruption on Long Island and in
1974 a team traced the route heroin takes from the Turkish poppy
fields to Long Island. In 1977, he won the John Peter Zenger press
freedom award.
   Greene and his wife, Kathleen, also have a son.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo on Wednesday
replaced six key Cabinet ministers and the head of South Korea's
politically powerful intelligence agency.
   There had been persistent reports of upcoming Cabinet changes to
quiet calls for Roh's resignation and stop public criticism of how
the government has handled recent unrest.
   The shuffle involved the home, construction, communications,
labor, health- social affairs ministers, and the first minister of
state for political affairs.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and other 16 ministers were
retained.
   Chief presidential press secretary Lee Soo-jung said the partial
shakeup was intended to restore law and order, ensure citizens'
welfare and safety and strengthen national security.
   In South Korea, periodic Cabinet shuffles stop the president from
having to take responsibility for government failures. In reality,
however, Cabinet ministers have little autonomy.
   In recent months there have been violent anti-government protests
by dissidents and radical students calling for Roh to step down.
They have, however, dwindled in recent weeks with police blocking
many rallies. The radical students lack public support because of
their extremist views.
   Former Attorney General Suh Dong-kwon, 56, replaced Park Seh-jik
as head of the Agency for National Security Planning, the main
intelligence agency.
   It was not immediately known if a new government post would be
given to Park, who was chief organizer of the 1988 Summer Olympic
Games in Seoul.
   Recent incidents, including the secret visits to North Korea by
dissident leader Moon Ik-hwan, opposition lawmaker Suh Kyong-won and
a disident student leader were thought to have prompted Park's
dismissal. South Korea forbids visits by its citizens to the
communist north.
   National Assemblyman Kim Tae-ho of the ruling Democratic Justice
Party was appointed home minister, succeeding Lee Han-dong, who was
dismissed because of an increase in violent crimes. Police come
under home ministry control.
   Kwon Yong-gack, president of the state-run Korea Housing Corp.
was appointed construction minister.
   Former lawmaker Kim Chong-in was made health and social affairs
minister, Communications Minister Choi Young-choul was reassigned as
labor minister, Former President Lee Woo-chae of the state-run Korea
Telecommunications Authority, took over Choi's former post.
   Park Chul-un was appointed first minister of state for political
affairs.

<HEAD>Governor Changes ``Revolutionary'' Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Henry Bellmon modified his day-old
school funding program that would all but abolish personal property
tax Tuesday, surrendering a plan to give a tax break on groceries.
   Bellmon proposed Monday to base school funding on a 15 percent
income tax surcharge on corporate and personal incomes and a new 2
percent school tax on goods and services.
   The governor said he made the proposal because the current
property tax is costly to administer and is not applied equally in
many counties.
   Bellmon's plan also called for eliminating the sales tax on
groceries. But the governor's office issued a statement Tuesday
saying the proposed exemption was being dropped because of
legislative objections.
   Bellmon also announced that the proposed new 2 percent gross
receipts tax earmarked for schools was being reduced to 1.9 percent.
   The plan has been called revolutionary by Education Secretary
Sandy Garrett because it eliminates local property taxes as a major
revenue source for funding schools. A drastically reduced property
tax would remain to retire any bonded indebtedness.
   The grocery tax exemption had been hailed by some as a selling
point for the program. But Bellmon said it drew objections during a
briefing session with legislators.
   He said the lawmakers were worried that some small cities, which
charge local sales taxes, could not survive the revenue loss from
exempting grocery sales.
   Oklahomans now pay a 4 percent state sales tax on grocery
purchases, in addition to municipal sales taxes. Bellmon said
grocery sales would be exempt under the new school gross receipts
tax.
   Bellmon's package also had included a 2 percent gross receipts
tax for cities, but he said that plan also will not be needed since
the grocery sales exemption was being deleted.
   He said the new program would provide an extra $245 million in
revenue, beginning in 1991, which amounts to an 8 percent increase
in the state budget.
   He has called the legislature to a special session beginning Aug.
14 to consider the plan.
   He said when it is fully implemented ``Oklahoma will be among the
leaders in educational excellence.''
   Under the Bellmon plan, the new school tax would redistributed to
counties on a per-pupil basis. The $847 million now going to schools
from the state's General Fund would continue to be distributed,
officials say.
   State Rep. Carolyn Thompson, chairman of the House Education
Committee, said legislators were ``trying to get some accurate
numbers'' to better analyze the program.
   ``There's no question it is a bold attempt to restructure our tax
policies and at this point it needs detailed analysis before public
policy decisions are made,'' she said.

<UNK>Jury Sees Tape of Soldier Admitting Yildirim Paid Him for Secrets</UNK>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A videotape played for a jury Tuesday in a
spy trial showed a soldier telling an undercover agent that the
defendant in the case paid him ``a lot of money'' for military
secrets.
   The tape was played on the second day of Huseyin Yildirim's trial
on charges he conspired to sell U.S. defense documents to the
Soviets and East Germans. Yildirim, 61, is from Turkey and lives in
Belleair Beach, Fla.
   On the tape, Army Warrant Officer James W. Hall III is seen
telling an FBI agent, who posed as a Soviet agent named Vladimir,
that Yildirim was his only contact in the scheme.
   ``The money had increased. It was substantial,'' Hall told the
agent during a meeting near Savannah late last year. ``He was paying
me a lot of money. What I wanted to be able to do was to afford some
of the things I wanted. ... I didn't flaunt the money.''
   On the tape, ``Vladimir'' counted out $60,000 in bundles of
$5,000 each to Hall at the end of an almost two-hour meeting.
   ``Now listen, please be careful with this when you get home,''
Vladimir told Hall on the tape.
   Hall, 30, is expected to testify later in the trial. He was
sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined $50,000 after pleading
guilty during a March court-martial to charges of espionage,
attempted espionage and failure to obey Army regulations.
   Yildirim is accused of helping Hall sell secrets to East German
and Soviet agents between 1983 and 1988, when Hall was stationed in
West Germany and New Jersey. Yildirim worked as a civilian mechanic
at an Army-run auto shop in West Berlin while Hall was there.
   The trial is being held in Savannah because Hall was stationed at
nearby Fort Stewart when he was arrested last December.
   Two Defense Department experts are at the trial to ensure that no
classified material is discussed. The videotape shown Tuesday was
edited to remove references to classified information, prosecutors
said.
   On the recording, Hall complained that his spy activity decreased
after he was transferred from Germany to New Jersey.
   ``In New Jersey, I was very busy,'' he said. ``I was with my wife
and children. ... The people I worked with were counterintelligence
people. They were very suspicious by their nature.''
   Army officials began investigating the case last summer after
being tipped that Hall, who had recently been promoted from staff
sergeant to warrant officer, was living a lifestyle his salary of
$20,200 could not support.
   Hall admitted to Army officials that he received more than
$100,000 between 1983 and 1988 for classified documents.

<HEAD>Central Figure in Florida Euthanasia Debate Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was a central figure in
Florida's right-to-die debate has died of natural causes before the
issue could be settled, but a relative says she will continue the
legal fight.
   Estelle M. Browning died Sunday at the Sunset Point Nursing
Center in Clearwater, where she had stayed since a debilitating
stroke 2{ years ago. She was 89.
   Mrs. Browning drafted a ``living will'' before she suffered the
stroke, asking not to be kept alive by artificial means if her death
appeared to be imminent.
   Doris Herbert, 80, Mrs. Browning's legal guardian, second cousin
and only living relative, said she will continue the legal battle to
uphold such a will because ``it might help someone else.''
   ``I'm sorry that things turned out the way they did, that she had
to suffer for 2{ years,'' said Ms. Herbert. ``I wanted more than
anything for her to live ... (but) I also wanted her wishes carried
out.''
   The case is destined for the Florida Supreme Court and may
clarify whether people have the right to refuse extraordinary
medical procedures that will prolong their lives.
   In September 1988, Ms. Herbert asked that intravenous tubes
giving Mrs. Browning nourishment be removed from her arm to carry
out her wishes.
   But a Pinellas Circuit Judge refused in April to allow the tube
to be removed.
   The Pinellas County state attorney's office said the case
involved more than Mrs. Browning's living will. It ``constitutes
genocide of the elderly,'' says prosecutor C. Marine King.
   In March, the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that
Ms. Herbert, as Mrs. Browning's legal guardian, had the right to
order the feeding tubes be withdrawn.
   The Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney's Office appealed the ruling to
the Florida Supreme Court, where it is pending. The appellate court
ruled that Mrs. Browning's constitutional right of privacy extended
to refusing such treatment, but asked the state's high court to
consider the case as a matter of great public importance.
   As a church volunteer, Mrs. Browning used to visit nursing homes
where she saw patients hooked to life-support machines. She signed a
living will in November 1985 asking that her death not be prolonged
artificially. ``I can go in peace when my time comes,'' she told
witnesses John and Rose King.
   Ms. Herbert moved to Dunedin from Albany, N.Y., to live with Mrs.
Browning in 1982, four years after Mrs. Browning's husband, Frank,
died. The two ``were like sisters throughout their lives,'' said
George Felos, Ms. Herbert's lawyer.
   ``It is hoped that the Florida Supreme Court ... removes the
government from the patient's deathbed, and leaves decisions in
these matters to be made by the patient and the patient's family,''
Felos said.
   State law allows patients to refuse food and water only if they
are competent and are terminally ill. Doctors testified that Mrs.
Browning was never terminally ill, although they said she couldn't
speak and had difficulty moving and that removing the feeding tubes
would end her life.
   Earlier this month, Gov. Bob Martinez vetoed a bill that would
have allowed people with living wills to refuse to be put on
life-support machines and feeding tubes, so long as doctors agreed
they were ineffective. He said the Legislature had prematurely
decided a controversial question without guidance from the state
Supreme Court.

   President Bush has before him a recommendation
to call for a permanent human outpost on the moon, to be used to
launch a manned mission to Mars, it was learned Tuesday night.
   The recommendation is contained in the draft of a major speech
the president is to give on Thursday, the 20th anniversary of the
day Neil Armstong took his ``giant leap for mankind'' on the moon
during the Apollo 11 mission.
   Bush said Tuesday that he had not decided what he would say on
Thursday.
   But if he accepts the speech before him, he will call for study
to begin on a multi-billion dollar project that would entail
building a permanent manned moon station and launching the first
manned flight to Mars from it, said a knowledgeable administration
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush also is expected to make a push for renewed funds for the
earth-orbiting space station, which is suffering congressional cuts
to the budget Bush proposed for it.
   One option that had been considered, a joint space mission with
the Soviets, is not in the recommendations Bush is reviewing, the
official said.
   Neither cost estimates nor a timetable was contained in the
moon-Mars proposal as drafted, but the venture would cost hundreds
of billions of dollars over decades.
   The source described Vice President Dan Quayle, who chairs Bush's
advisory National Space Council, as the driving force behind the
proposal, put together with the help of the council staff.
   The vice president has been briefing members of Congress and
industry leaders on what such a project might entail, the official
said.
   In California, where he is making a series of speeches, Quayle
did not divulge what Bush might say Thursday. But he fanned the
speculation by saying the Bush administration ``is moving forward to
put the pieces in place for another great leap forward in space.''
   He said the nation ``must begin to think about the voyage of a
new Mayflower _ about expanding the human presence into the solar
system _ as a long-term goal.''
   The only specifics he mentioned regarding White House plans for
space were three projects already announced _ asking Congress to
support Space Station Freedom, a new Earth observation satellite and
the national aerospace plane.
   Quayle's goal and that of other boosters of rejuvenation of the
space program is ``to give the space program a mission again, so it
gets the funding it deserves,'' the official said.
   Space boosters have been calling for the president to make a bold
proposal akin to President John F. Kennedy's 1961 pledge to put a
man on the moon by the end of the 1960s, a pledge that Armstrong
kept on July 20, 1969.
   Other sources said White House officials preparing Bush's
Thursday message on space asked for extensive briefings on plan
drafted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration called
``Mission to Planet Earth,'' a proposal for an intense environmental
study of the planet from space.
   The Planet Earth project calls for an intensive study of the
Earth and its environment, using data gathered by sophisticated
satellites and by scientists and instruments orbiting aboard the
space shuttle.
   ``There was talk that by supporting the Mission to Planet Earth
the President could help his image as the environmental president,''
a NASA source said.
   Bush, returning from Europe aboard Air Force One, was asked
Tuesday about his space speech, but gave no indication about what
his plans were.
   The president said he did not know if his announcement would be
``a big space announcement'' or simply ``an event commemorating
those (Apollo) years.''
   Bush added: ``I'm not ready to say whether we're going to have a
new space initiative. I want to be sure that what I propose passes
any test of fiscal sanity, fiscal reasonableness.''

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ The assistant U.S. secretary of state for
inter-American affairs met secretly with a Nicaraguan Foreign
Ministry official two weeks ago, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The center-right weekly La Cronica said the U.S. official,
Bernard Aronson, and the Nicaraguan official, Victor Hugo Tinoco,
met during the inauguration of Argentine President Carlos Menem in
Buenos Aires on July 8.
   ``The news was made known to La Cronica by sources at the
Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry who are above doubt,'' La Cronica said.
``The meeting was absolutely secret and no one else took part except
Mr. Aronson and Mr. Tinoco.''
   The United States has turned down a request by President Daniel
Ortega for talks aimed at improving relations.
   Washington has said Nicaragua instead should seek talks with the
internal political opposition.
   There was speculation here, but no confirmation, that Aronson met
with Tinoco last week in San Jose, the capital of neighboring Costa
Rica. Aronson and Ortega both were in Costa Rica on Friday.
   Aronson came to Central America on a four-country tour that did
not include Nicaragua.
   Ortega had gone to San Jose on Friday on what was announced as a
one-day trip to speak with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. Ortega
did not return to Managua until the following day. Aronson also left
on Saturday.
   While in San Jose, Ortega said he would be willing to start talks
with the Nicaraguan political opposition on further reforms to
electoral and news media laws in preparation for general elections
Feb. 25.
   Vice President Sergio Ramirez, in an interview with a small group
of journalists on Friday, praised Aronson as ``a civilized man, with
whom one can talk, converse, discuss.''
   Ramirez was comparing Aronson with his predecessor, Elliot
Abrams, a strong supporter of Contra rebels fighting to overthrow
the Sandinistas.
   When asked if he had met with Aronson, Ramirez said, ``No, but
Tinoco has.'' He did not elaborate.

   Republicans and Democrats, hailing the first
successful flight of the B-2 bomber, warn that the
half-billion-dollar aircraft must still clear the ``checkbook
hurdle'' in Congress.
   The radar-evading bomber, accompanied by two F-16 fighters,
performed test maneuvers during a nearly two-hour flight Monday in
Southern California _ a maiden excursion 18 months behind schedule.
   Despite the success, lawmakers stressed that the stealth bomber,
which at about $500 million a copy is the most expensive plane in
history, looms large on the radar screen of the budget-conscious
Congress.
   ``I think there's a great deal of reluctance to spend that much
money per airplane,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2
Republican leader. ``The president and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
will have to work hard to carry a vote in the House.''

   A congressional study of the nation's system
for guiding aircraft says some air traffic controllers work without
video screen information on altitude, speed and direction for up to
16 minutes.
   However, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Agency said Monday
safety had not been compromised, thanks to adequate backup systems.
   ``The long and short of it is that controllers are not working in
the blind when these things occur,'' Dick Stafford said. ``Backup
systems provide them with information _ not as good as the regular
information _ but we're not going to put more aircraft in the sky
than can be safely handled at any given time.''
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., on Monday released a draft of the
study he had commissioned in March 1988 from the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   The GAO recommended Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
direct the FAA to take action that would avert further interruptions

   Death threats to a pair of Roman Catholic priests
are a daily ritual now. They say it is proof that their crusade
against the sale of drug paraphernalia is paying off.
   At hundreds of stores throughout the city, an elementary school
pupil looking for candy can find himself shopping side-by-side with
an addict buying a new crack pipe, the priests say.
   ``You go in a store and what you see right off is bread, candy
and drug paraphernalia,'' said the Rev. Michael Pfleger. ``This is
teaching children that drugs are an ordinary part of life.''
   The efforts of Pfleger and the Rev. George Clements, whose
parishes are in the city's South Side, have brought confrontations
with store owners and misdemeanor arrests for refusing to leave
shops in Chicago and, in Clements' case, in Shreveport, La.
   Each Saturday, Pfleger and 100 or so parishioners of St. Sabina's
fan out to the neighborhood liquor stores, groceries and video shops
that openly sell the drug gear. From Clements' Holy Angels Church,
the priest and parishioners make daily forays.

   President Bush said Tuesday he was offended by
Republican advisers who portrayed Dan Quayle as a campaign disaster
who had to be protected from his own political ineptitude.
   In a new book by Jules Witcover and Jack Germond, several
consultants to last year's Bush-Quayle election campaign depict the
vice presidential candidate as a lightweight who was not ready for
the national political scene.
   One of the ``handlers'' employed by the Bush team to manage
Quayle's campaign travels, Joseph Canzeri, said the former Indiana
senator was tough to work with because he had a limited attention
span, the ``impatience of youth.''
   ``He's a fairly quick study, but about what he wants to hear,''
Canzeri was quoted as saying in the book, ``Whose Broad Stripes and
Bright Stars? The Trivial Pursuit of the Presidency 1988.''

   Thousands of armed men roamed an ethnically

beatings, officials reported.
   A national Interior Ministry official said some of the 3,000

   Today is Sunday, July 23, the 204th day of 1989. There are 161
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 23, 1886, New York saloonkeeper Steve Brodie supposedly
made a daredevil plunge from the Brooklyn Bridge into the East
River, a claim supported and disputed by various witnesses. Brodie,
who died in 1901, became a celebrity, although doubts about his
famous leap remain to this day.
   On this date:
   In 1829, William Austin Burt of Mount Vernon, Mich., received a
patent for his ``typographer'' _ a forerunner of the typewriter.
   In 1885, Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United
States, died in Mount McGregor, N.Y., at age 63.
   In 1904, by some accounts, the ice cream cone was discovered by a
Charles E. Menches during the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St.
Louis.
   In 1914, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia following
the killing of Archduke Francis Ferdinand by an assassin. The
dispute led to World War I.
   In 1945, French Marshal Henri Petain _ who had headed the Vichy
government during World War II _ went on trial. (He was condemned to
death and his sentence was commuted.)
   In 1951, Henri Petain died.
   In 1958, Britain's Queen Elizabeth named the first four women to
peerage in the House of Lords.
   In 1967, rioting that claimed some 43 lives erupted in Detroit
after police raided a black-owned nightspot.
   In 1977, a jury in Washington D.C. convicted 12 Hanafi Moslems of
charges stemming from the hostage siege at three buildings in March
1977.
   In 1982, actor Vic Morrow and two children were killed when a
helicopter crashed on top of them during filming for ``Twilight
Zone: The Movie.''
   In 1986, Britain's Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson at
Westminster Abbey in London.
   Ten years ago: Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini called

<HEAD>`Re-creations' to Be Part of New NBC News Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Network news will enter the questionable world
of ``re-creations'' this coming season on CBS and NBC.
   The cast and producer of NBC's new ``Yesterday, Today and
Tomorrow,'' as well as the news division's president, argued before
a meeting of television critics that there's nothing wrong with TV
news re-creating news events, though such dramatizations have
heretofore been the bailiwick of ``infotainment'' shows like
``America's Most Wanted'' and ``A Current Affair'' on Fox and NBC's
``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   ``It's just another way of telling a story, the same way
newspapers use graphics, they use other ways to reconstruct,'' said
NBC News President Michael Gartner.
   ``When we do re-creations, we will do them, I assure you,
responsibly, clearly labeled, and very cautiously,'' said Mary Alice
Williams, one of the three co-hosts of the new show.
   ``We will only use them when there is no other way to convey the
story, when there is no other archival footage for this. We might
compare it to, as you know in a federal court, you still can't bring
cameras in, and so we have courtroom sketch artists.''
   CBS' ``West 57th'' also plans to use re-creations this coming
season as part of a revamping of the show that includes the addition
of anchor Connie Chung.
   Chuck Scarborough, another co-host of the new NBC show, along
with Maria Shriver, said he did have ``trepidations'' about the use
of re-creations, but in fact had himself once used a dramatization
in a story he did on a murder _ which elicited a letter of complaint
from an NBC executive in charge of the local New York NBC station
for which Scarborough works.
   ``I think all of us have other assignments within NBC News, and
no one wants to damage their credibility,'' said Shriver.
   Executive producer Sid Feders suggested re-creations are ``a
natural next step'' in television news. ``We have done artist's
renderings, we have done animations and drawings. I think an
audience is sophisticated enough and ready for it. People aren't
dumb out there.''
   The questioning of the ``YTT'' group followed a press conference
by Gartner, who announced that former ``Saturday Night Live''
producer and current NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol would be
taking on additional duties in the news division overseeing the
``Today'' show. Some critics in the audience felt that the No. 1
entertainment network was blurring the lines between entertainment
and news.
   ``I'm going to work for Michael,'' said Ebersol, ``I'm working
for a newsman. (Gartner is a former newspaper editor who joined NBC
last year.) And when you talk about shows and so forth, let's keep
in mind that all the network news heads today, with the exception of
Michael, did not start in news. One started in politics (CBS' David
Burke) and another one started as the pre-eminent sports producer of
our time (ABC's Roone Arledge).''
   ``The sports department of The New York Times certainly talks to
the metro desk ... I just say, I don't believe in artificial
barriers, but I believe very, very strongly in principles and
guidelines,'' said Gartner.
   Gartner said being the news division in the No. 1 entertainment
network made it harder to get news shows into prime time.
   ``Now there's no question that CBS and ABC have, let's say, a
mediocre prime-time schedule ...,'' he said. ``Those networks,
therefore, are constantly coming to the news division saying, will
you give us something? ... It's cheaper to do a news show, and
that's why they have an easier time.''
   Speaking of NBC, he added, ``The overall robustness of the
network rebounds to the benefit of the news division.''
   ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' will premiere Aug. 2 as a
series of specials. NBC has not had a weekly prime-time news shows
since ``1986'' went off the air at the end of that year.
   CBS has ``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th.'' ABC has
``20-20'' and the new ``Prime Time'' with Diane Sawyer and Sam
Donaldson.

the outset of the 1980s that high technology would produce more
leisure time have not come true.
   Instead, longer hours are common, stress levels higher and the
amount of time available for family and social life reduced.
   ``Our observations are that people have become exhausted,''
Daniel Stamp, president of Priority Management, said in an
interview. ``I think the `80s were a time of of massive, massive
change.''
   The training company's survey of business people Stamp described
as ``middle management and above'' found 85 percent worked more than
45 hours each week, 89 percent take work home and 65 percent work
more than one weekend each month.
   Forty-eight percent of those surveyed said they experience stress
every day and 81 percent said they suffer stress at least once a
week. The stress is seen most commonly by headaches and anger and
its causes are listed first as the job, second as interruptions and
third as the manager or supervisor.
   The survey of 1,000 people around the world had a response rate
of 41.1 percent. Stamp said he believed it was highly accurate.
   Among the other findings were that executives are spending more
time traveling, but not on holidays. It found 26 percent spend more
than five weeks each year on business trips and 62 percent take two
weeks or less of vacation. The survey also found signs that family
and social life may be suffering as a result of the trend to longer
hours. Although 52 percent said they spend at least one hour daily
with their children, 27 percent said they spend less than 15 minutes.
   ``It doesn't make you happy working like this,'' Stamp said.
``It's going to inevitably reflect on the working day.''
   Stamp, whose office windows offer a panoramic view of Vancouver's
magnificent skyline of skyscrapers, sea and snow-capped mountains,
came to Canada from Britain in 1979.
   His experience had been in academics, and as he moved into the
business world he found himself snowed under by the demands of the
faster pace.
   ``I discovered that nobody had these skills,'' said the trim,
bearded, 43-year-old. ``I thought it was just me who was going to
pieces.''
   The company was started in Vancouver in 1984, offering a
``Time:Text'' program that teaches how to set priorities and get
organized.
   Priority Management, now headquartered in Irving, Texas, has 200
franchised offices. The operation extends to Canada, the United
States, Australia, New Zealand, Britain and Ireland. Offices in
Spain and Portugal are planned.
   The company claims more than 175,000 people have gone through its
programs.
   Stamp said he adheres to his own advice and sets a working day of
8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. After that, he's home with his family.
   ``There is no loss of income as a result of being balanced,'' he
said. ``I think it's probably quite the opposite.''
   The company's program asks clients to outline their goals for
three years. They learn to break those targets down to one year and
finally to one month.
   ``Monthly is a great cycle. It's also reachable,'' Stamp said.
``On a monthly basis it will guide you.''
   He said the techniques learned in setting a monthly goal also can
be applied to daily schedules, noting that even something as simple
as a phone call can take five minutes less time if it's planned.
   ``Everybody knows the theory. You don't have to be a rocket
scientist,'' Stamp said. ``My question is, do people practice it?''

   At Louisiana State Penitentiary, despair has a
name: Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   The maximum-security prison, once among the nation's bloodiest,
is under a state of emergency declared by U.S. District Jude Frank
Polozola after a string of murders, suicides and escapes this year.
Inmates blame Roemer's stinginess with clemency for the 4,800 men,
most serving life or very nearly life.
   ``It's the hope of release that generates faith in the system.
When an inmate loses faith, you have a ticking time bomb,'' said Ron
Wikberg, who has served 21 years of a life sentence for murdering a
grocery clerk during a robbery in Lafayette.
   Roemer granted clemency to four people _ only one of them from
Angola _ and approved 10 pardons from March 13, 1988, and June 23,
1989. Predecessor Edwin Edwards approved clemency for 42 people and
22 pardons from March 13, 1984, to June 23, 1985, the start of his
last term in office.
   Inmates accuse Roemer of going back on his word to reduce
sentences fairly, based on merit. Under Edwards, money and political
connections got inmates out of prison, they said. Howard Marsellus,
Edwards' pardon board chairman, is now serving five years in prison
for his role in a pardon-for-sale scandal.
   When model prisoners have no hope of release, they try to escape
or kill themselves, Wikberg said. ``Unmodel prisoners'' assault or
kill others.
   ``I don't believe that's the problem. That's an excuse,'' Roemer
said.
   ``There's two schools of thought,'' said state Department of
Corrections chief Bruce Lynn. ``One, inside the prison, says they
need more clemency. The people on the outside say, `No they don't.'
   ``The governor's caught between a rock and a hard place.''
   Prisoners cite the case of lifer Francis ``Corky'' Clifton, 52,
who after 27 years in prison was made a trusty, tending bloodhounds
and attack dogs. But two months ago he ran away from the house where
he lived, forfeiting the chance to spend the rest of his sentence
free of chains and cells.
   ``I realized I had a lot to lose,'' Clifton said after
surrendering five days later. ``To think you're going to die here,
it just gets to you. It gets to working on your mind.''
   Assistant Warden Roger Thomas said: ``The unwritten message from
other inmates and employees used to be, `If you behave yourself, in
10 or 15 or 20 years you're going to be able to go home.' What's
happening is the long-termers aren't going home.''
   Consequently, many prisoners believe they have nothing to lose,
he said.
   Inmates want only what they have earned, said Wilbert Rideau, the
editor of the award-winning prison magazine The Angolite.
   ``They're not asking for anything special. They're asking for
people to treat them fair. I can't imagine the average citizen
having a problem with that,'' said Rideau, 47, who has served 28
years of a life sentence for slashing the throat of a bank teller in
Lake Charles.
   ``The bottom line is he needs to grant clemency to deserving
inmates. He needs to keep his word to prisoners,'' said Floyd Webb,
36, who has served nine years of a life sentence for a shotgun
slaying in St. Tammany Parish.
   Wikberg, 46, an associate editor of The Angolite, said much of
the dissatisfaction can be traced to an April ``20-20'' feature on
Rideau and his inability to secure release. ``Every inmate at Angola
was watching that show.''
   In the ``20-20'' piece, Roemer made his stand on clemency clear.
   Clifton said that was when he decided to flee.
   On May 1, lifer Steven Calloway Howard, 34, escaped after 10
years in prison. He was captured nearby three days later.
   On May 8, lifer Donald Fink, 39, tried to run off and, after
warning shots, was wounded by guards. ``I'm tired and I'm going
home,'' long-term inmate Henry Patterson quoted Fink as saying.
   Angola has long had a reputation as a hard place. The state's 38
death row prisoners live here, close to ``Gruesome Gertie,'' the
electric chair used to execute 18 men since 1983. Eight were
executed in the summer of 1987.
   The 18,000-acre prison, 50 miles north of Baton Rouge, is
surrounded by the Mississippi River on three sides and the
impassable Tunica Hills on the other. The location is remote,
accessible only by a single, winding dirt road.
   In 1971, the American Bar Association described conditions as
medieval, squalid and horrifying. Inmates told of the ``Red Hat,''
where unruly prisoners were kept naked in dark, damp dungeons and
given only spoonfuls of food. There were reports of 70 murders in 18
years and rampant homosexuality.
   In 1975, Polozola of Baton Rouge declared the prison in a state
of emergency. Ross Maggio, called ``the gangster'' by inmates for
his unwavering adherence to rules, was brought in as warden to scour
away the blood and filth.
   By most accounts, he succeeded. Food was improved, wretched
dining halls were cleaned, prisoners were kept busy with work in the
fields and organized recreation. More guards were hired and given
better pay.
   The prison seemed dormant for almost a decade until four murders,
four suicides, 64 stabbings and 11 escapes in 14 months forced
Polozola to declare a new state of emergency June 21. Another
suicide occurred earlier this month.
   The fury at Angola is hidden behind the concertina wire. The
grounds are trim and neat. Guard towers rise above white fences,
rows of corn and herds of cattle. The prison camps look washed and
the steel bars are painted.
   Maggio, who retired in 1984, is coming back as Polozola's
court-appointed prison specialist, but Warden Hilton Butler remains
in his job. Polozola will not comment about the case.
   Maggio is a nervy man. Kidnapped at knifepoint with his mother by
two trusties in 1982, he ran his truck into the main gate, grabbed a
pistol from a guard and unloaded it into the cab. One inmate was
killed and another wounded. Doris Maggio, then 64, was cut by the
windshield's spraying glass.
   Butler, chosen warden of the year in 1987 by the North American
Association of Wardens, said Maggio isn't needed, that there is no
state of emergency. What is needed, he said, is more guards and
better pay for them.
   For two years, Butler has run Angola with a $46 million budget
and 1,200 guards. This year, budget cuts deprived guards of the
$100-a-month premium for working in a maximum-security prison. It's
been years since they had a raise.
   That doesn't help inmates either, Wikberg said. ``There's a
ripple effect here. When employees are happy they treat prisoners a
bit better. When they're demoralized, it's hard on inmates.''
   ``It's a situation that's ripe for anything,'' Webb said.

<TEXT>
   Vincent Melomo wants to be a journalist and was
thrilled to land an internship with a worldwide news agency. But
he's uneasy, even anxious.
   The news agency is Tass, the Soviet wire service.
   ``I have strong reservations about working for any government
organization that's primarily a propaganda device,'' said the
20-year-old history major. ``But that was overcome by saying, well,
I have to see it, see how it works, see what my involvement is
before I can really make such lofty decisions.''
   For the first time, the New York bureau of Tass has taken on
American university students as unpaid summer interns covering
metropolitan news. The agency hopes to spruce up its image in the
United States and help turn its English-language service into a
moneymaking enterprise.
   To that end, Tass also has hired Irene Stevenson, 28, a graduate
student of Slavic studies at the University of Texas, to edit its
English-language wire at its Moscow headquarters. She is to start
work in September.
   ``We are trying to show that we are not really the voice of the
government,'' said Igor Y. Makurin, the New York bureau chief. ``The
government told us: `You are on your own. You have to earn your
living.' We have to find means to be self-sufficient, to earn our
money, to pay our bills, to pay our lunch.''
   Tass' English-language wire has 11 U.S. customers, including The
New York Times, The Associated Press, the United Nations and several
databanks. But that isn't enough to make the service profitable. And
Makurin described two recent efforts to market the wire in the
United States as ``a disaster.''
   In 1987, Tass sent brochures and letters to 3,000 U.S. radio
stations; out of eight to 10 responses, none signed on. Last year,
it contacted 75 newspapers and eight agreed to a free two-month
subscription. All canceled after that.
   One criticism was that the English Tass was putting on the wire
was unfit for American consumption, Makurin said. ``You write a
story in Russian and then the guy in Moscow translates it into
English. And the service sometimes is very clumsy, the translation
is clumsy, and a ... lot of mistakes.
   ``Sometimes our subscribers call us and ask, `What do you mean by
saying this?' or `Something is funny.''' For example, ``Passover''
was once translated as ``Jewish history,'' he said.
   Enter the American students.
   The interns started working on Memorial Day. The three American
undergraduates and one Swedish graduate student, all of whom are
studying at local universities, were selected from six applicants.
   During their first week, the interns wrote about the Van Cliburn
International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, Texas, whose
semifinalists included three Soviet pianists; a Soviet-American
sailing expedition; and a recent anthology of Soviet and American
writers, ``The Human Experience.''
   The students hope their stories will be used by a news
organization in one of the 115 countries that have Tass subscribers.
   ``When I write a story I imagine that it might be picked up in an
African country that relies on Tass for information,'' said Sofia
Gustafsson, 29, a graduate journalism student at New York University
and U.N. tour guide.
   ``I probably don't realize the importance of the whole thing,''
said Laura Yow, 19, of suburban Philadelphia, who will be a
sophomore at Barnard College. ``It's just a place that I go and I am
working for them.''
   ``I don't look at it as a Soviet-American thing, but as a
journalism thing,'' said Miss Yow, who is working mornings at Tass
and afternoons selling crystal and china at Tiffany's, a five-minute
walk up Fifth Avenue from Tass' offices in Rockefeller Plaza.
   Miss Gustafsson agreed. ``It seems to me like any other news
service. All the big papers are here, the press releases seem to
arrive, calls are made. The things that I would expect to find in
any news organization are here.''
   But Melomo, who will be a senior at Adelphi University in the
fall, does not consider Tass just any news organization. And,
although he is reluctant to admit it, he is having second thoughts
about working there.
   ``I consider myself a progressive sort of person and I like to be
contributing to whatever societal progress we are having between the
two countries. And if I can help any way I suppose this is it.''
   And yet, he is skeptical.
   ``My father once worked for the government and he had to get a
security clearance and there's a lot that goes into that. And he
warned me to at least investigate this,'' said Melomo, whose family
lives in Knoxville, Tenn.
   ``Plus, I know in certain areas of the country, in the more
conservative South I don't know how they would welcome someone who
worked for Tass. I'm just aware of other people and other times and
how this thing would be viewed rather than just right now, when
everything seems so harmonious. Times change.''
   But for now the times are good.
   In the last few years, Soviet-American relations have changed
dramatically and so, too, has the operation of Tass, said Makurin,
who has worked in the New York bureau for nine years and been its
chief since 1987.
   Two to three years ago, most story assignments were made in
Moscow; now the bureau can file directly on the Russian wire without
editing in Moscow.
   ``We decide here what kind of story we'll write here. We've got
freedom of choice,'' said Makurin, a warm, genial man. The students
have taken to him and respect his editorial judgment. He reads their
stories and edits them.
   ``I know what is the news and I try to show them how to make
their stories readable. But I don't want to force anything.''
   What does Makurin want the Americans to take away from their
three months?
   ``Something good about Tass. That we're not bad guys.
   ``I want them to find out the way we work in the United States.
... It should be educational for them. Especially at the present
time, when relations between the two countries are not that bad.
   ``Maybe it could improve our relations, not on the official level
but on the level of common people.''

<HEAD>Split Has Widened in Year Since Schism Over Lefebvre</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A year after the first major Roman Catholic
schism in a century, the Vatican admits it has been unable to
curtail the ultra-traditionalist movement of Marcel Lefebvre, the
rebel archbishop.
   Both sides say Lefebvre has gained thousands of followers since
he was excommunicated for consecrating four bishops in defiance of
papal orders.
   Cardinal Paul Augustin Mayer, head of a papal commission charged
in July 1988 with keeping traditionalists in the church, says many
bishops resist a Vatican effort to make the old Latin Mass more
available.
   ``Among traditionalist Catholics there is an attitude of
desperation, and because of that an ever-greater number of them
consider returning to Monsignor Lefebvre as the only possible
response,'' the West German cardinal said in an interview with the
Italian Catholic monthly 30 Giorni (30 Days).
   Some Catholics believe the church should be cautious with
compromise. Church sources said the presidents of the bishops'
conferences of England, France, West Germany and Switzerland told
Pope John Paul II in May he was going too far in wooing
traditionalists.
   Lefebvre, 83, rejects the reforms of the 1962-65 Second Vatican
Council, including acceptance of religious freedom, celebration of
the Mass in local languages and interfaith cooperation.
   John Paul said after the schism June 30, 1988, that followers of
the French archbishop faced excommunication unless they renounced
him, but even the threat of expulsion, the church's gravest
punishment, has not hindered the movement.
   Spokesmen for Lefebvre said only 16 priests had left his St. Pius
X Fraternity, based in Switzerland, since the split with the Vatican
and 34 had been ordained, bringing the number of priests to 222.
   They said the number of faithful had increased by 10 percent to
15 percent. The papal commission serving traditionalists, Ecclesia
Dei, said attendance at Lefebvre churches in many areas had grown by
30 percent.
   ``An overall view of the statistics would indicate this
particular challenge is not being effectively met on the part of the
official church structure,'' said a Vatican official familiar with
the work of Ecclesia Dei, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the Lefebvre movement was ``growing in leaps and bounds''
in the United States and expanding in France, Australia and South
America.
   Ecclesia Dei officials say the attraction of the renegade
movement is mostly its use of the 16th century Latin Tridentine
Mass, which was suppressed after Vatican II. In the new Mass, the
local language is used and the priest faces the congregation instead
of the altar.
   Cardinal Mayer said in the interview with 30 Giorni that many
bishops have ignored the pope's request a year ago to make ``full
and generous'' application of a 1984 decree allowing the Tridentine
rite to be used in special circumstances.
   ``Lay people know this and their response _ in England, France,
America _ has been to turn to the St. Pius X Fraternity of Monsignor
Lefebvre,'' he said.
   The Lefebvre movement claims millions of sympathizers and Vatican
estimates put its membership at 100,000 to 1.2 million. The Roman
Catholic Church has about 850 million members.
   An official at the U.S. National Catholic Conference of Bishops
familiar with the traditionalist issue said privately the ``vast,
overwhelming majority'' of American Catholics support the new Mass.
   He also said the Lefebvre movement goes far beyond preference for
the Latin Mass to embrace ``social, economic and political stances.''
   Lefebvre is an ardent anti-communist. Some officials of his
movement say they doubt the Holocaust, in which the Nazis killed 6
million Jews during World War II. In May, a Frenchman accused of
crimes against humanity as head of a pro-Nazi militia was captured
in a French priory run by Lefebvre followers.
   In October, the Vatican recognized the Fraternity of St. Peter, a
traditionalist order led by a former Lefebvre official. The
fraternity, with 18 priests and 30 seminarians, encourages
Lefebvre's followers to return to the church.
   Ecclesia Dei has granted special permission to more than 150
priests to use the old Mass, and has received scores more requests
from priests who chose to ask the Vatican instead of their local
bishop.
   Vatican efforts to blunt the impact of his renegade movement have
irritated Lefebvre, making it unlikely the church will be able to
heal its first major schism since the Old Catholics left the church
in 1870 over the issue of papal infallibility.
   ``They are waging an indecent war against us,'' Lefebvre was
quoted as saying in 30 Giorni's latest issue. ``How is it possible
to have a dialogue with these men?''

   Dwayne Redding's voice softens and his eyes cloud
with dark memories as he talks about the year he turned 15.
   That was 1981 and Redding was a high school sophomore with
college plans and a part-time job. He also was a young black male in
a city where his type was being hunted down by a wily killer who
already had gotten someone Redding knew.
   ``I was frightened. I mean, I really was frightened, because it
hit close to home,'' he said. ``That's when it crossed my mind that
I could become a victim.
   ``Here I was, a 15-year-old kid, working at a Dairy Queen until
11 or 12 o'clock at night. What saved me from being a victim?''
   The killings began 10 years ago, soon bringing terror for the
children of Atlanta's black neighborhhoods. Residents believed the
deaths were linked after about four bodies were found, months before
police officially announced a connection. From July 28, 1979, until
May 24, 1981, 28 victims slipped into the clutches of a killer.
   Finally, there was an arrest. Self-styled music promoter Wayne B.
Williams, a pudgy, bespectacled young black man, was convicted of
two murders and sentenced to life in prison. Police also blamed
Williams for 22 other slayings.
   Not everyone accepted Williams' connection to the other killings,
and some people still push for the cases to be re-examined.
   From the time Edward Smith and Alford Evans were found dead in a
weedy lot until Nathaniel Cater's naked body surfaced in the
Chattahoochee River, young black men in Atlanta lived with the fear
they could be next, but they never really talked about it.
   They say counseling efforts never reached far enough into their
circles. Psychologists say many children shunned counseling, either
out of bravado or confusion.
   Whatever the reason, these grown men, when they reflect upon
their childhood horror, feel their generation was abandoned.
   ``We need to deal with it, get it out and talk about it. It's not
too late to do that,'' said Derrick Boazman, a 23-year-old student
at Morris Brown College. ``It's a must _ for the sake of justice _
that we re-examine the whole issue. It needs to be brought to the
forefront.''
   Boazman was 13 when the murders began. By the time they ended, he
had joined a youth group, the United Youth-Adult Conference, and
given up activities that kept him out after dark.
   ``We were kind of scared; we didn't want to say we were,'' he
said. ``It was a saddening feeling to think that someone out there
was preying upon and victimizing children.''
   Redding, 23, a student at Georgia State University, didn't say
much to anyone about the murders until 1986. Some soul searching
prompted him to think more about Timothy Hill, a victim who had
frequented the ice cream parlor where Redding worked at the time.
Hill's body was found March 30, 1981.
   ``He was a likeable kind of kid. He liked to talk to you,''
Redding said. ``I'll never forget the day of his funeral, seeing the
funeral procession. Everybody was silent and saddened, and it was
kind of weird being that close to someone who had been the victim of
what I still consider an unsolved murder.
   ``It never occurred to me to go to counseling. It hit me later.
It prompted me to be a bit more introspective about the magnitude of
what had taken place. It is an issue a lot of people would rather
forget about. And I can't understand that.''
   The fear still haunts Michael Hardnett, 26, an electrician.
   ``I thought if it could happen to them it could happen to me,
too, 'cause back then I used to hang out in the late hours,'' he
said. ``Every time I left the house and hit the street, I felt I had
to be on my guard. I had to watch my back.
   ``Now, I'll go out, and when I leave, I'm always looking out the
door or down the street. When I hear something, I want to know what
it is.''
   Hardnett said his friends didn't want to accept what was
happening.
   ``A couple of them, they didn't want to say they were scared, but
I'd say they were scared,'' he said. ``I wasn't just going to ignore
it. I knew I was a small person and I could get picked up that
easily.''
   Boazman said he had not been overwhelmingly concerned with the
murders until a schoolmate from his neighborhood, 12-year-old
Charles Stephens, was murdered Oct. 9, 1980.
   ``It struck home for me. I'll never forget it. I didn't want to
be caught outside after it had gotten dark,'' Boazman said. ``Now,
the magnitude is still a quandary for me. If I had been approached
or accosted, it would have been terrifying.''
   As lawyers prepare new appeals for Williams, the young men who
could have been victims say they do not believe Williams committed
all the murders pinned on him. They say those cases should be
reopened.
   They say the public was never fully aware of other suspects in
the case. Police questioned hundreds of possible suspects; they
arrested a relative in the case of 7-year-old Latonya Wilson, but
released him later.
   The young men criticize Mayor Andrew Young and Public Safety
Commissioner George Napper, both of whom are black, for not renewing
investigations of the 22 cases linked to Williams, who was arrested
in June 1981 and charged with murdering Cater and 21-year-old Jimmy
Ray Payne.
   ``I never felt in my heart that Wayne Williams was the killer of
all those persons. I really feel it was a conspiracy,'' Boazman
said. ``To close the doors on all the rest is an injustice. Whatever
happened to the leads on them, the public doesn't know.
   ``It was politically expedient to keep it hushed,'' he said.
``Here we have, in the black community, all these heinous crimes,
then have a black man convicted. To see another young, intelligent
black man arrested and sent to jail for those cases. ... The
psychological effect could be lasting.''
   Hardnett agreed. ``It just seemed like they were after anybody to
me. They just said, `Well, he did it.' I really just thought it was
wrong, because to me they just didn't care about the other cases.''
   Prosecutors decline to comment because of Williams' impending bid
for a new trial. But Larry Howard, who was director of the state
crime lab during the killings, says dog hairs, carpet fibers and
other evidence painstakingly plucked from victims' bodies solidly
linked the bulk of the murdered children to Williams.
   ``I think in those cases where we identified physical evidence,
there was a single person. I think we identified Williams as that
person,'' Howard said from his retirement home in Montana. ``We were
pretty much on target.''
   Redding, who leads a group that monitors racial situations on
college campuses in Georgia, said he also doubts Williams' guilt
because the city's leadership ``seemed to thirst and hunger for a
scapegoat'' once Williams was arrested.
   ``I feel justice must be served,'' he said. ``We have to
investigate these crimes just as thoroughly and just as severely as
the Jews have continued to investigate those who were perpetrators
of Nazi acts of war.
   ``We have to be that serious about it.''

   In just over a decade, a heart procedure called
angioplasty has grown from a high-tech experiment to a treatment
widely available in community hospitals. Cardiologists have rushed
to offer a service that clearly helps patients, but many are poorly
trained and inexperienced. In a continuing series, ``The Business of
Medicine,'' Science Writer Daniel Q. Haney and National Writer Fred
Bayles look at how large fees determine who does angioplasty.

   More than 200,000 Americans will have balloons
thrust into their hearts this year, often by doctors who are
inexperienced, poorly traind and motivated in part by the big fees
they can earn.
   Many attempt the delicate procedure known as angioplasty once a
month or less. Colleagues say some are so unskilled that hospital
technicians must lead them through the work step by step.
   Many top heart specialists believe these low-volume doctors are
often incompetent at angioplasty. Yet there is almost nothing to
stop them. Typically, hospitals allow their cardiologists to perform
the work alone after taking a three-day course or doing a few
operations with a colleague.
   ``It has been wide open to anyone who can convince their patients
to have it,'' said Dr. Stephen Oesterle, who performs 250 a year at
Los Angeles' Good Samaritan Hospital.
   Angioplasty is unquestionably an important medical advance,
capable of relieving angina chest pain for many people with heart
disease.
   Last year, an estimated 235,000 patients underwent the procedure.
Doctors fish wires through the plugged blood vessels of the heart,
then inflate balloons that squeeze back fatty buildups that block
the flow of blood. When all goes well, doctors remove the wires and
balloons, and blood sails smoothly through the dilated arteries.
   But many of the nation's leading cardiologists worry that
angioplasty has spread too quickly into too many small hospitals
where it is performed by too many doctors with too little experience.
   For an hour or so of work, doctors typically charge about $2,000.
In the view of many, those who attempt an occasional angioplasty are
motivated more by what's good for them financially than what's good
for their patients.
   ``It's dilate for dollars,'' said a worried Dr. Thomas Ryan of
Boston University Medical Center.
   Almost everyone agrees that in angioplasty, practice makes
perfect.
   ``There is no such thing as a good low-frequency operator. You
cannot do that kind of medicine on a casual basis, because it
requires technical skill that comes from doing it regularly,'' said
Dr. Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic. She, like Ryan, is a
former president of the American Heart Association.
   Among small hospitals doing a low volume of angioplasty is
229-bed Garfield Medical Center in Monterey Park, just east of Los
Angeles. The hospital's cardiac catheterization lab, where the
procedure is performed, is headed by Dr. Eugene Margolis.
   He has done 148 angioplasties in nine years, making him the
hospital's most experienced angioplastor. Last year, he performed
52, while the four other doctors who work there did 17, 14, 10 and
nine.
   In his view, performing two procedures a month is sufficient to
maintain proficiency. But he added, ``I have people who work at our
lab that, if I had the power to just say, `You stop,' I'd do it.
   ``Either they are too nervous, they don't have the experience or
they don't do that good a job.''
   Two of his colleagues _ whom he did not name _ are particularly
unsure of themselves, he said. ``They sometimes literally have the
technician almost have to do the case for them. The technicians know
enough to walk the doctors through the case, if they have to.''
   Bruce Lopez, a registered nurse who is one of the lab's
technicians, confirmed this.
   ``We are not physicians, but we have as much experience as they
do,'' he said. ``We don't like to be put in the position with
inexperienced angioplastors of telling them what to do next.''
   Why do these people perform angioplasties at all? ``Because it's
lucrative, and everybody wants a piece of the pie,'' said Margolis.
   The occasional angioplastors are allowed to continue at his
hospital, because no patients have died, he said. ``If they were
killing people you could do something.''
   Margolis explained: ``Unless something is really gross, it's hard
to get doctors to stop doing what they're doing, to take away their
priveleges. We don't have anybody that bad.''
   Even in inexperienced hands, angioplasty is rarely fatal.
However, less experienced doctors' complication rates can be higher,
they are less likely to react appropriately in emergencies and they
have less success with the basic goal of reopening clogged heart
arteries.
   At Garfield, for instance, Margolis said 75 percent of
angioplasties are initially successful, and 4 percent to 5 percent
of patients require emergency bypass operations when the procedure
abruptly closes an artery instead of widening it.
   A few miles away at Good Samaritan, where eight doctors do about
700 angioplasties a year, the figures are considerably better: 95
percent of angioplasties are initially successful, and 3 percent
require emergency surgery.
   Competition among doctors and hospitals to perform angioplasty is
particularly intense in California. USCI Division of C.R. Bard Inc.,
which makes angioplasty equipment, estimates that 850 hospitals in
the United States performed angioplasty last year, and 114 of them,
or 13 percent, were in California.
   However, experts say the motivation to perform a few procedures
each year exists everywhere. Money is seen as a chief reason.
   ``This is an ethical issue, because if there was no monetary
incentive, they would refer them to the experts and not do it
themselves,'' said Dr. Augusto Pichard of Washington Hospital Center
in the nation's capital.
   Pichard said doctors also are motivated by the desire to hold
onto patients. Some cardiologists worry that if they send
angioplasty cases to competitors, they will never see those patients
again.
   Another reason is ego. Dr. H.J.C. Swan of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles said many seem to tell themselves: ``If I'm a
cardiologist and I've had some training in angioplasty, by God I can
do it. And by God I can do it just as well as the big shot at the
big medical center who's doing 10 a day.''
   Finally, there is the prestige of being part of the most
technologically advanced branch of heart medicine.

   Exactly how many angioplastors are at the low end of the volume
scale is unknown. But even an industry official, USCI's marketing
vice president, Claudia Russell, called it ``an unfortunately high
number.''
   Ryan went further. ``I think the unskilled angioplastors
outnumber the skilled ones,'' he said.
   Ryan is helping draw up voluntary angioplasty standards for the
heart association, the American College of Cardiology and American
College of Physicians. Sources said Ryan's committee is expected to
recommend that doctors perform at least 75 angioplasties annually or
stop doing them.
   Several experts said 50 is a bare minimum necessary to maintain
the competence to do simple angioplasties _ and yet that may be only
the average number done annually by each of the roughly 4,600
cardiologists who perform them.
   ``Not everybody who has a catheterization lab should have the
privilege of being able to do angioplasty,'' said Dr. David Faxon,
who does 200 a year at Boston University Medical Center. ``I think
it should be restricted.''
   Dr. Spencer King III of Emory University in Atlanta, who does 500
angioplasties annually, said the number of doctors doing the
procedure is still growing, and money has to be a reason.
   ``The young cardiologists don't want to go into office
practice,'' he said. ``They don't want to run coronary care units.
They don't even want to do nuclear cardiology. They want to do
cardiac catheterization and angioplasty _ and those are the highest
ticket items. It's fun, but it ain't that much fun.''

<TEXT>
   If a doctor says you need an angioplasty,
here's a word of advice from the experts: Make sure your physician
is competent.
   How? Ask lots of questions.
   Many people are reluctant to challenge their physician's skill at
doing the procedure, perhaps because they fear the doctor will be
insulted.
   ``People spend more time in Los Angeles searching out the right
restaurants than the right person to perform a procedure that
potentially threatens their lives,'' said Dr. Stephen Oesterle of
Good Samaritan Hospital.
   But top cardiologists say that good practitioners will not be put
off by reasonable questions. Here are some to ask:
   _``How many angioplasties have you done?''
   Experts say 50 a year is a bare minimum to keep up competence.
Several cardiologists said they would not have the procedure done on
themselves by doctors who perform fewer than 200 annually.
   _``Do you routinely do angioplasties in cases as complicated as
mine?''
   A single narrowing in one heart artery is easier to treat than
multiple blockages in several arteries. If your problem is complex,
make sure the doctor has already successfully handled similar cases.
   _``What is your success rate?''
   Doctors who specialize in angioplasty are routinely able to
initially open up 95 percent or more of blocked arteries. About 3
percent of their patients require emergency bypass surgery, and less
than 1 percent die.
   _``Will a skilled team of heart surgeons be waiting in case
something goes wrong?''
   Surgical backup in the same hospital is considered mandatory.
   _``Are there are other options that might be better for me?''
   Alternatives to angioplasty can include medicine, bypass surgery
or no treatment at all. Don't hesitate to get a second opinion if
you have any doubts about whether angioplasty is necessary.

<HEAD>Over Six Months, Bush Has Edged Away From Reagan Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few weeks after Ronald Reagan was shot in
1981 by a would-be assassin, he was asked if he now favored gun
control. No, he said, it doesn't do any good.
   A few weeks after a man opened fire with an AK-47 in a schoolyard
in Stockton, Calif., George Bush, who had come to office just as
adamant as Reagan on gun control, switched signals.
   His administration imposed a temporary ban, now made permanent,
on imports of semiautomatic weapons deemed to have no legitimate
sporting purposes.
   Slowly, without calling attention to the process, the Bush
administration has turned away from positions firmly held by Ronald
Reagan and warmly endorsed in 1988 by candidate Bush.
   In place of a ``Reagan evolution'' is a Bush evolution.
   Now, six months after Bush stepped into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
there's evidence aplenty that the new conservative president has
parted company from the old conservative president.
   On Mideast policy, pollution issues, the minimum wage, the
defense budget, budgetary matters in general; on Star Wars and the
sale of oil leases, aid to the Contras and fuel economy standards
for automobiles, Bush has abandoned the Reagan agenda for his own
positions. Usually they are more to the left of where Reagan stood.
   Political analysts aren't surprised.
   ``Some change is inevitable,'' says C. Lowell Harris, former
executive director of the Academy of Political Science. ``After four
or eight years, there are bound to be occasions where new looks at
things _ even by people who are fundamentally sympathetic to the
earlier policies _ are inevitable.''
   Stephen Hess, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution,
says a vice president, after years in the shadows, has a visceral
need ``to show his differences, to show a streak of independence''
when he takes over as No. 1.
   ``Bush would say there is more that's alike than different, and
he would probably be right,'' Hess says, ``but what's different is
what's interesting and what makes news.''
   William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute says each
man revealed his own character in his presidency.
   Reagan was ``an agenda president'' who appointed people like
Edward Meese III, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Elliott Abrams, Oliver North to
carry out his agenda _ and theirs, he says.
   Bush, on the other hand, is an ``in-basket president _ you figure
out what the problems are and you deal with them.''
   Here are some places where Bush has abandoned Reagan policies:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONTRA AID. Reagan once summed up his policy toward the leftist
Nicaraguan government in two words: ``Say Uncle.'' For eight years,
he did whatever he could to help the Contras overthrow that
government. When Congress cut off funds for military aid, the
Iran-Contra affair resulted.
   Just two months into office, Bush struck a deal with Congress
that gave up Reagan's goal. The new president made it clear he was
willing to accept a future in which the leftist Sandinistas remain
in power in Managua.
   Much like a treaty between nations, a four-page agreement was
signed by Bush and congressional leaders after secret negotiations
on Capitol Hill by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   It provided $4.5 million a month in non-lethal aid to the
Contras, chiefly intended to encourage them to return home and
battle the Sandinistas in the political rather than the military
arena. Even that limited aid would be cut off automatically if the
Contras engaged in military attacks or cross-border incursions.

<TEXT>
   STAR WARS: With great fanfare, in a television speech to the
nation on March 23, 1983, Reagan announced plans for a space-based
defense system against intercontinental missiles _ the system that
became known as Star Wars.
   ``I've become more and more deeply convinced that the human
spirit must be capable of rising above dealing with other nations
and human beings by threatening their existence,'' said a president
whose commitment to the idea was evident to anyone watching.
   Billions of dollars later, Bush appears to be edging away from
the Reagan commitment. The first clue of that came from John G.
Tower, while he was still hopeful of being confirmed as secretary of
defense.
   Tower testified that he personally did not believe ``that we can
devise an ... umbrella that can protect the entire American
population from nuclear incineration.''
   An ``umbrella'' exactly like that was the Star Wars goal that
Reagan envisioned.
   Bush cut spending on the program to $4.6 billion for fiscal 1990,
down from the $5.9 billion Reagan had proposed. Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney also announced that Bush would shift the focus of Star
Wars from deployment sometime in the 1990s to research on a more
advanced system known as ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' consisting of 3,000
to 5,000 small orbiting satellites, each capable of tracking and
destroying an intercontinental ballistic missile.
   Whether Bush will be any more willing than Reagan to use Star
Wars as a bargaining chip in arms control negotiations with the
Soviets remains to be seen.

<TEXT>
   MIDEAST: The Reagan administration opened contacts with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, but was careful to go no further
than nudge the Israelis toward seeking a settlement with the Arabs.
Substance did not change, but emphasis did in the Bush
administration.
   The nudge became a shove when Baker replaced Secretary of State
George P. Shultz.
   Two speeches show the change in tone.
   Shultz, on Sept. 16, 1988: ``Israel will never negotiate from or
return to the lines of partition. But it must be prepared to
withdraw ... from territories occupied in the recent conflict.''
   Baker, on May 22, telling Israel to ``forswear annexation'' of
the occupied territories: ``Now is the time to lay aside, once and
for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel.''

   BUDGET: A state of budgetary warfare existed for most of the
Reagan presidency between the White House and the
Democratic-controlled Congress. After months of stalemate, the
October 1987 stock market crash _ which was fed by concern over
federal deficits _ made both sides agree they had no choice but to
compromise.
   The result was a budget accord that Reagan, swallowing hard,
signed off on. It provided for new taxes that he had opposed and
cuts in defense spending.
   When Reagan left office, Bush inherited a Reagan budget proposal
that called for more growth in military spending. Bush revised it:
The Pentagon budget would stay abreast of inflation but not grow
beyond it.
   Taking a cue from Bush's inaugural address _ ``To my friends, and
yes I do mean friends, in the loyal opposition, and yes, I do mean
loyal, I put out my hand'' _ Bush's budget negotiators quickly
struck a deal with Congress.
   Bush accepted even less for the military and more for domestic
programs, bragging of a budget compromise that for the first time
was ``reached ahead of schedule and not framed in the context of a
crisis.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GUN CONTROL: Each time he was asked if the shooting by John
Hinckley hadn't changed his mind on gun control, Reagan said no. He
said Hinckley broke a District of Columbia law, and more laws
wouldn't make any difference.
   That view was shared by Bush, too, when he took office, but the
new president changed his tune. Before he did so, his wife took a
stand.
   In the aftermath of the Stockton, Calif., schoolyard shooting
that left five children dead and 29 wounded, Barbara Bush said she
``absolutely'' favored a ban on semiautomatic assault-style weapons.
   Even then, Bush held firm. But a public outcry _ joined in by
police _ over the widespread availability of semiautomatic weapons
changed the atmosphere. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
responded. It froze, then banned, imports of those weapons which it
said were not suitable for sport.

<TEXT>
   THE ENVIRONMENT: Midway in his presidency, Reagan called his
environmental record ``one of the best kept secrets in Washington.''
But even Anne Burford, his first head of the Environmental
Protection Agency and herself a target of environmentalists'
criticism, became a critic of Reagan's record.
   ``We don't have an environmental policy in this administration,''
she said three years after leaving office.
   Bush said in June that it is time to ``break the stalemate that
has hindered progress on clean air for the past decade'' and
announced proposals for revising the Clean Air Act, unchanged for a
dozen years.
   Bush's program is intended to clean up the smog in most cities by
the year 2000 and sharply reduce the forest- and lake-killing
pollution known as acid rain. It provides for a 50 percent reduction
in sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants that are
a chief cause of acid rain. It also calls for a phase-in of cars
powered by methanol and a requirement that industry use new
technology to curb the release of cancer-causing chemicals.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the Bush proposal was
the most positive move by the United States in a decade of Canadian
complaints about acid rain.
   The Bush administration also has proposed higher fuel economy
standards for automobiles, standards that Reagan had tried to
eliminate outright.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OIL LEASE SALES: Reagan had proposed leasing three areas off the
coasts of northern and southern California and southern Florida for
oil exploration. Preparations were under way when Reagan left office.
   Bush held the leases up pending a review of the environmental
consequences. Said Bush: ``Should the task force report indicate
significant adverse environmental effects that have not been
previously identified, a decision will be made to delay further or
cancel the sale.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MINIMUM WAGE: From Franklin Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter, the
minimum wage was increased under every president until Reagan. It
was fixed at $3.35 an hour when Reagan took office in 1981 and it
remained there when he left. Reagan proposed a lower rate for young
people _ $2.50 _ but no increase for other workers.
   Bush retained the idea of a lower minimum for youth _ this time
dubbed a ``training wage'' _ but announced his willingness to accept
an increase in the minimum wage to $4.25 over three years.
   Democrats in Congress pushed through an increase to $4.55 with a
subminimum to be paid workers with less than two months' work
experience. Bush vetoed the bill and Congress failed to override.

   R. Gordon Hoxie, president of the New York-based Center for the
Study of the Presidency, thinks the nation is now seeing the real
George Bush.
   ``Prior to 1980, there was a great difference between him and
Reagan, so he had to always submerge those differences,'' Hoxie said.
   ``Bush's whole approach to things is different,'' he says. ``He's
far more of a hands-on president than his predecessor.''
   ``I think this president is much more sensitive to minority group
interests and I think he's going to make headway with blacks and
Hispanics,'' Hoxie adds, calling attention to one more area of
difference.
   Bush paid tribute to the late Martin Luther King as ``an American
hero.'' In 1983, Reagan was asked about charges by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., that King had communist sympathies. Referring to future
declassification of Justice Department records, Reagan replied:
``We'll know in about 35 years, won't we?'' He subsequently
apologized to King's widow.
   Hess says Bush, no matter how he departs from Reagan's record, is
careful to pay homage to Reagan.
   ``There will be a time when George Bush needs Ronald Reagan. In a
mid-term election, he may wish to use Reagan, or if there's a severe
economic downturn,'' Hess says.
   ``So he's got to be very attentive personally while making the
proper separations politically. That's the trick.''

   Business sales were virtually flat in May while
inventories rose 0.7 percent, the government said. Some analysts
predicted further production cutbacks during the rest of the year.
   The Commerce Department said Monday that inventories held on
shelves and backlots climbed to a seasonally adjusted $776.9 billion
in May after a 0.8 percent rise in April.
   The pace of business sales, on the other hand, hardly moved,
rising a minuscule 0.02 percent to a seasonally adjusted $517.9
billion. Sales had risen 2.0 percent in April after holding steady
in March.

<TEXT>
   A Chinese government company has given an
American camera maker the right to lease 60 million square feet of
land for up to 25 years and sublease it to other foreign firms that
want to manufacture in China.
   The Concord Camera Corp. signed the unusual agreement Monday in
Hong Kong with the Wan Kong Economic Development Corp. of Baoan
County.
   The deal appears to be an attempt on China's part to help regain
the confidence of Western investors following the June crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators that left hundreds of people dead.
   Many foreign business representatives fled the country during the
turmoil, and the repercussions are believed to be having a serious
impact on the nation's economy.
   Under the agreement, Concord, based in Rahway, N.J., will
sublease manufacturing space and supply labor to other corporations
that want to operate in the newly formed industrial park in Baoan
(prounced bow-ahn), in southern China's Guangdong province, about 15
miles north of Hong Kong.
   Jack Benun, chairman of Concord, declined to say how much the
deal was worth. He said his company had yet to determine how much it
would charge for space in the industrial park.
   Over the weekend, the official China News Service quoted a
Chinese official from southern Hainan province as saying China
wanted to proceed with another project that also allows a foreign
firm to lease space to foreign investors.
   An official at the Hong Kong office of that firm, Kumagai Gumi,
the Japanese construction giant, said Monday the firm had no comment
on the Chinese report about the Yongpu Port.
   In recent weeks, Hong Kong newspapers have said conservative
Chinese officials, who have gained power as a result of the
crackdown, had criticized projects such as these. The officials were
quoted as saying the projects were tantamount to selling China's
sovereignty to foreigners.
   To increase confidence of potential investors, Benun said,
Concord was planning to establish an insurance company that would
guarantee assets on the leased property. But he said his firm hadn't
arranged the details yet.
   Benun said he secured the deal during a visit of top officials
from Baoan County to his New Jersey home several weeks ago. The
basis of the deal, he said, was Concord's six-year relationship with
the county.
   Concord began producing cameras in Baoan in 1983 and has gone
from occupying 10,000 square feet of space to its current production
facilities of 240,000 square feet. It now employs 2,000 Chinese.
   Benun said Concord makes approximately 4 million cameras a year,
55 percent of which are sold in the United States and 45 percent in
Europe and Asia.
   Benun said he did not believe the recent unrest in China would
affect his investment.
   ``It's our belief that with six years under our belt and with the
local authorities having always delivered what they promised there
should be no reason why anything should change,'' Benun said.
   He said the space to be leased is currently fields and mountains.
   Asked why the Chinese were willing to grant leasing rights to a
foreign firm, Benun said he believed the Chinese saw the need for
foreign help in marketing China.
   ``It's like a company with a good product needing a little
marketing help,'' he said. ``They believed that the management of
our company would tell the story better even than they could.''

<HEAD>EEC Agrees To Continue U.S. Beef Hormone Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of the European
Community have agreed to continue talks with the United States
seeking to defuse the sensitive issue of the EEC's ban on
hormone-treated meat.
   Their decision Monday was a compromise between Britain's softer
line and Italy's harder one.
   Announcing the decision, the EEC vice president for foreign
affairs, Frans Andriessen, said the trade bloc would increase its
efforts to import U.S. certified, non-hormone-treated beef.
   Andriessen reiterated the EEC criticism of what it views as
unilateral U.S. action, both in the hormone dispute and in a
conflict over EEC soybean imports.
   ``We continue to contest unilateral actions taken by the U.S.,''
he said.
   Britain had proposed exempting ox-tongues, a popular food there,
from the hormone ban. British officials said that could have
restored as much as $40 million of the $100 million a year the U.S.
has estimated it is losing from the EEC ban.
   That might have enabled the U.S. to reduce its retaliatory duties
on $100 million worth of EEC goods, British officials said.
   But Andriessen said the 12 EEC foreign ministers decided against
the British proposal because it would have required a change in EEC
laws, and would have damaged the credibility of the ban on hormones.
   An Italian proposal for the EEC to erect counter-measures against
the U.S. retaliatory duties was also rejected as unwise, Andriessen
said.

   Dean Witter Financial Services Group Inc. says it
will expand its stock research capabilities, doubling the number of
companies it tracks, in a restructuring that will include up to 40
layoffs.
   Dean Witter said Monday the move is designed to improve the
company's retail brokerage business at its branch offices and to try
to stimulate more corporate finance activity.
   Spokesman Jim Flynn said the company, parent of the investment
firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., the nation's third-largest retail
brokerage, would increase the number of analysts who follow
companies to about 70 from about 45 now.
   Philip J. Purcell, Dean Witter's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a memo to employees that Dean Witter eventually
would track 1,300 publicly traded companies, compared with about 500
now.
   ``These initiatives are designed to provide additional equity
products for our account executives and clients, enhance the support
for our corporate finance growth and provide more effective
institutional client service,'' Purcell said.
   He said Dean Witter would be ``effecting modest staff
reductions.''
   Flynn said 30 to 40 layoffs were expected in the company's
equities division over the next six months. The area now has about
500 employees, he said.
   Flynn said Dean Witter hoped that by increasing the number of
companies tracked and improving contact with those companies, it
could stimulate activity in the firm's corporate finance department.
   ``We have been building our investment banking professional staff
and capabilities and this new alignment in research will only serve
to bolster our efforts,'' Purcell said.
   Dean Witter, which is owned by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., has more
than 24,000 employees, including 17,000 in its investment services
operations and 7,000 in its Discover credit card operation.

<HEAD>House Approves Bill to Let Farmers Plant Some Alternative Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House by voice vote approved legislation
that would allow farmers to plant some alternative crops without
losing their acreage base for federal farm programs.
   The bill was sent Monday to the Senate, where there has been no
action on similar legislation. The Bush administration has no
objection to the bill.
   Under the measure, farmers in 1990 could plant up to 20 percent
of the acreage designated for program crops, such as wheat, feed
grains, cotton and rice, with certain alternatives _ namely canola,
rapeseed, sunflower, safflower, flaxseed, kenaf, crambe, guayule,
milkseed and meadowfoam.
   The legislation allows the alternative planting without causing
loss of the acreage base used to determine eligibilty for federal
farm programs.
   The government would require farmers to plant at least 50 percent
of their acreage in program crops in order to be eligible to plant
alternatives.
   The congressional budget office estimates that the bill would
save the government $10 million in fiscal 1990 and $15 million in
fiscal 1991 because of reductions in deficiency payments and storage
and handling payments for program commodities.

<HEAD>Drexel Closes Madrid Office Due to Improper Stock Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has pledged to
toughen its securities law compliance, reacted swiftly to reports of
improper stock dealing at its Spanish office by closing down the
operation.
   ``We said some time ago that the new Drexel would not countenance
improper behavior, and we meant it,'' Drexel Chief Executive Fred
Joseph said in a statement Monday.
   Drexel, which has agreed to plead guilty to unrelated U.S.
securities law violations, said it determined the Madrid office had
told Spanish securities officials it would sell stock in a large
European oil company to individual investors but sold it to a few
private institutions instead.
   Drexel said it shut the office independently of an investigation
by Spanish officials into the stock sale during the partial
privatization of Repsol SA earlier this year.
   Drexel said it had determined that its Spanish affiliate, DBL
Capital Markets Espana SA in Madrid, used the names of 400
individual investors to obtain 97,600 shares of Repsol but sold the
stock to private institutions.
   The investment firm, which has offices worldwide, said all but
17,815 of the shares went to institutional clients and the rest went
into a trading account at Drexel. The firm said it made $123,069 in
commissions and trading profits on the transaction.
   Spain's National Securities Commission alleged that Drexel
falsified documents during Repsol's offer of 79.95 million shares at
the equivalent of $14.70 each, or a total of $1.14 billion. The
shares were sold to 400,000 investors worldwide from April 20 to May
6.
   In a filing with Spanish securities regulators, Drexel requested
a block of the shares worth about $60 million and said they would go
to the 400 individual investors. But officials said that on May 11,
the first day of public trading, Drexel improperly sold the shares
to the private institutions.
   Spanish regulators said last week that some of the 400 investors,
mainly friends and relatives of Drexel employees, were unaware their
names had been used as nominees for the stock in Repsol, Europe's
eighth-largest oil company.
   Results of the investigation in Spain have not been announced.
   Drexel could be fined up to five times the profit on the
transaction in the case, according to reports from Spain. Criminal
charges also are possible if Drexel used investors' names without
their permission, the reports said.
   Drexel said DBL Capital Markets Espana officials waited 10 days
before telling the parent company that Spanish authorities had
requested information about the Repsol transaction.
   Drexel also said it was withdrawing its application for a
brokerage license in Spain. The firm said Spanish authorities had
not requested the withdrawal.
   Drexel's Madrid office, which opened in 1987, employed 27 people.
   In his statement, Joseph said there were reports in Spain that
other firms in Madrid engaged in similar transactions during the
Repsol offering but ``that is something for Spanish authorities to
determine.''
   ``For Drexel, it is behavior which we find unacceptable and
cannot condone, and is clearly not the manner in which we plan to
conduct business,'' Joseph said.
   ``We recognize that the decision to close is a drastic step ...
however prompt response was called for,'' he said.
   Drexel last year agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a
record $650 million to settle U.S. securities law violations
stemming from the government's crackdown on Wall Street crime.
Drexel also agreed to overhaul its management and toughen its
internal compliance systems.

Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a period of sluggish investor activity,
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is getting a bargain by purchasing
the retail brokerage division of struggling Wall Street firm Thomson
McKinnon Inc., analysts say.
   After canceling a full merger, the two investment firms announced
Monday the sale that will add Thomson McKinnon's 2,000 brokers at
154 offices to Prudential-Bache's sales force of 6,000.
   The deal comes during a period of retrenchment on Wall Street and
sustained skepticism about whether individual investors scared off
by the 1987 stock market crash will ever return to the market in
pre-crash numbers. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. recently sold its
entire retail unit to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``If you acquire a firm with a lot of brokers it's an opportunity
to expand for a very low cost,'' said Brenda Davis McCoy, who
follows the securities industry for PaineWebber Inc.
   A merger agreement between the two investment firms announced
June 13 was scrapped Friday after Prudential-Bache discovered
problems with Thomson McKinnon's financial records.
   ``When it became clear a merger was not feasible, rather than
parting ways, we worked together to develop this new arrangement,''
Prudential-Bache Chairman George L. Ball and Thomson McKinnon
Chairman J. Ronald Morgan said in a statement.
   Prudential-Bache, the nation's fourth-largest securities firm,
will acquire Thomson McKinnon's retail business and customer
accounts. Officials said the combined retail sales force at
Prudential-Bache, which has more than 320 offices, would be trimmed
by an undetermined amount.
   Thomson McKinnon had 4,700 employees before the sale.
   Terms were not disclosed, but people familiar with the deal said
Prudential-Bache will pay $60 million up front plus another $60
million over three years in incentives designed to keep Thomson
McKinnon brokers from leaving.
   The sale effectively marks the end 104-year-old of Thomson
McKinnon, which has struggled since the market crash and repeatedly
entered into sale negotiations with other major brokerages.
   Thomson McKinnon officials said the firm planned to sell its
remaining assets, such as its capital markets, Hong Kong and
administrative operations, in the coming months.
   Among problems that led to scrapping the merger was a reported
$80 million difference between Thomson McKinnon's liabilities and
cash reserves. Weekend negotiations yielded the retail brokerage
deal.
   Prudential-Bache is the brokerage arm of Prudential Securities,
which is owned by Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
   Prudential-Bache also said it plans to purchase about 5 percent
of Thomson McKinnon Asset Management LP, the firm's only publicly
traded entity, which operates its money and investment management
business. The partnership's unit price closed down 50 cents at $10
in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday.
   Under the deal, Thomson McKinnon brokers will not be able to sell
Prudential-Bache money market mutual funds once they join that firm.
Officials said the split was designed to prevent brokers from
selling only Prudential-Bache funds and to keep the Thomson McKinnon
asset management fund alive.
   Thomson McKinnon brokers will continue to offer other non-money
market mutual funds managed by the asset management group. Also,
Prudential-Bache brokers will not sell Thomson McKinnon mutual funds.
   Last October, privately held Thomson McKinnon, the nation's
ninth-largest brokerage, said it was looking for a buyer to purchase
the 23 percent Thomson McKinnon stake owned by the Hartford
Insurance Group, a unit of ITT Corp.
   ITT spokesman Jim Gallagher said Monday the company may have to
increase to $27.5 million from $23 million the second-quarter
reserve it expects to take from the sale of Hartford Insurance's
stake in Thomson McKinnon, reducing ITT's earnings by 19 cents a
share.
   ITT said the size of the reserve depends on Thomson McKinnon's
ability to pay Hartford for the 23 percent stake. Under the aborted
June 13 merger agreement, Hartford was to sell back all its shares
to Thomson McKinnon.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Some Resent Job Interview By Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computerized job interviews make people more
honest but less comfortable, a recent study found.
   Applicants tend to give straighter answers to computers, possibly
because they believe the computer is more likely to catch a lie,
according to the study. But some people, particularly those seeking
higher-level jobs, resent placing their job future in the hands of a
machine.
   The study was done with students in simulated job interviews. It
was conducted by Dennis Nagao, a researcher at the Georgia Institute
of Technology's College of Management, and Christopher Martin of
Louisiana State University.
   A growing number of companies are using computers to conduct
initial job interviews. The applicant answers a series of questions
on a computer terminal, and if the responses show promise the job
seeker will be called back for a follow-up.
   ``In the case where you have a higher-level job, your expectation
probably includes some kind of face-to-face interview,'' Nagao said.
``These people come in expecting to get a little more detail _
someone to answer their questions.''
   The validity of the responses was checked by comparing the
interview responses with the students' actual academic record.
   ``We got a lot of exaggeration, but the exaggeration was much
stronger in the face-to-face situations than in the computerized or
the paper and pencil situations,'' Nagao said.
   Nagao attributed this to people making ``socially desirable''
responses _ telling the interviewer what they think he or she wants
to hear.
   ``If you try to present yourself in a favorable way, you will
respond in a certain way,'' he said.
   When the pressure of trying to make a good impression on the
interviewer was removed, Nagao said, the applicants tended to be
more honest.
   Nagao said there needs to be more study on the effectiveness of
computers in job interviews. But he said the findings of resentment
show the need to pay attention to how the computers affect people.
   Employers perhaps should have a company representative talk to
the job seeker immediately after the computer interview, he said.
   ``Our point is to alert people that you can't just put a bank of
PCs in a room and shuttle people through,'' Nagao said.
   ``We're not saying it (computer interviewing) is bad at all,'' he
said. ``All we are saying is let's not get blind-sided. Let's look
at the social consequences and get away from the feeling that
everything is hunky-dory and you don't need to look beyond.''
   Computer interview services sell their systems on the basis of
consistency, accountability and their ability to profile job
applicants. Steve Boyd, vice president of Human Resource Systems, an
Atlanta-based job interview service, said the computer programs are
especially popular with banks and retailers.
   Nagao and Martin conducted their study by observing a group of
students in simulated job interviews with a friendly interviewer, a
``cold'' interviewer, a paper-and-pencil application and a computer.
   The researchers divided the test applicants among those seeking
an entry-level clerk job and those wanting a management trainee
position. The researchers observed how the applicants felt
afterwards.

<HEAD>Canadian Interest Rates Remain High as Inflation Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates are likely to stay high in Canada
despite their drop in the United States because of the Canadian
government's determination to control inflation, economists here say.
   ``I don't think there's much chance of their coming down,'' Marc
Meagher of Merrill Lynch Canada said Monday. ``I'd be sort of
inclined to look for more stability than any decline over the short
term.''
   ``I don't think that recent months argue for any easing (of
interest rates),'' added Mark Chandler of the Royal Bank of Canada
in a phone interview.
   Inflation rose in June to a 5.4 percent year-over-year rate, the
highest level in more than five years, after a 5 percent rate in
May. The same figure in June 1988 was 3.9 percent.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson said last week in Paris that high
inflation in Canada leaves little room for loosening domestic
monetary policy. He said a ``different perception'' on inflation in
the United States allows American officials more flexibility to ease
monetary policy.
   The Bank of Canada kept its rate at 12.30 percent last week, in
the same range it has been since early June. The rate is the minimum
cost of short-term financing to Canada's chartered banks, who have
been offering most day-to-day loans at 13.5 percent.
   The prime rate in many U.S. commercial banks has dropped as low
as 10.5 percent. That rate is charged to customers with the best
credit ratings.
   Many analysts believe that the widening difference between
Canadian and U.S. rates has contributed to the Canadian dollar's
strength since spring, attracting investors. It has been trading in
the range of 83 to 84 cents to the U.S. dollar, one or two cents
higher than most forecasts had predicted.
   As in the United States, the Canadian economy has expanded for
seven years. Projections of a slowdown in the next year are
widespread, with some mention of a potential brief recession.
   A survey of forecasts by the Toronto Globe and Mail's Report on
Business earlier in July projected a fall to 2.9 percent in annual
growth for 1989 and 1.5 percent next year, down from the 4.5 percent
increase in the gross domestic product that was registered in 1988.
   Strong growth, however, took place in the first quarter of 1989
when real output rose at a 3.8 percent annual rate.
   Wilson said in June that the economy's strong showing in the
first part of the year indicated the Bank of Canada's high interest
rate policy was justified.
   The Bank of Canada's governor, John Crow, has said repeatedly
that keeping the lid on inflation is his top priority.
   The increase in June inflation, however, was largely a result of
higher federal and provincial taxes and seasonal food prices. As
such, most Canadian private sector analysts believe, the figures
would not prompt the government to push interest rates even higher.
   The employment situation in Canada also boosted the view that the
government must hold off before declaring that the brakes on the
economy have been applied sufficiently. No drop in interest rates is
expected until indications are clearer that the economy actually is
slowing down.
   In June, unemployment fell to 7.3 percent, which was its lowest
since summer 1981.

<HEAD>CFTC Curtails Control Over ``Hybrid'' Financial Instruments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is
curtailing its control over exotic investment products known as
``hybrids,'' such as bonds linked to the price of oil or bank rates
tied to the consumer price index.
   Hybrids are so named because they are financial instruments
combining some aspects of commodity futures and options with the
characteristics of debt securities such as bonds or bank deposits.
   Examples of these hybrid instruments include a bank deposit with
its interest rate indexed to the exchange rate of the dollar and the
Japanese yen, or a corporate note with its yield tied to the price
of gold or oil.
   New rules the CFTC approved Monday detailed the types of hybrids
that will be exempt from its scrutiny, including debt securities
already regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, time
deposits offered by a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. or instruments where the value of the option part has a
premium of no more than 40 percent of the instrument's issue price.
   The hybrid issue has been controversial since 1987 when the the
CFTC, which regulates futures and commodity options markets, first
proposed that such new investment instruments be regulated by the
commission and traded only on organized exchanges.
   But hybrid investment product issuers complained that such
regulation would kill the development of a potential
multibillion-dollar market.
   In January, the commission voted 5-0 to remove some kinds of
hybrid instruments from its control and formalized that vote Monday,
``thereby facilitating continued innovation and competition in these
and related markets,'' said CFTC Chairwoman Wendy L. Gramm.
   ``Some have argued that the commission should not make any
statements in these areas, arguing that the regulatory uncertainty
that exists was created by the commission's unwarranted assertion of
jurisdiction. This simply is not true,'' said Ms. Gramm in a
statement.
   ``Regulatory uncertainty results because these innovative
instruments, by their very nature, tend to cut across established
regulatory and jurisdictional boundaries,'' she said.
   The CFTC also voted to issue to a policy statement on the kinds
of swap transactions it will not regulate because of jurisdictional
limits.
   Interest-rate and currency swaps are widely used to manage risks
in world financial markets. In a typical interest-rate swap, one
party _ such as a bank strapped with by fixed-rate customer loans _
exchanges its fixed-rate debt for an equivalent amount of
floating-rate debt to alter its interest-rate exposure.
   The International Swap Dealers Association breathed a sigh of
relief after an 18-month debate with regulators over the issue.
   ISDA Chairman Mark C. Brickell said U.S. dealers were now free to
develop ``swap options and commodity swaps of all types, including
swaps of physical commodities and financial indices. This enables
U.S. dealers and end-users to play on a level field with their
worldwide competitors.''
   The CFTC criteria bar marketing a swap to the public and require
that the swap be undertaken within the parties' lines of business.
   The commission said it will continue to review swaps that do not
meet its criteria on a case-by-case basis.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Again Yen; Stocks Fall Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen today,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged for the
fifth straight trading day.
   The dollar ended at 142.35 yen, up 0.82 yen from Monday's
141.53-yen finish. The index started at 141.55 yen and moved between
141.43 and 142.50.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 112.49
points, or 0.34 percent, closing at 33,343.73.
   The index has lost more than 400 points since Wednesday.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said
market players avoided buying issues ahead of a release of U.S trade
figures later today and a major national election in Japan on Sunday.
   ``Japanese market players have been very nervous about this
election because we haven't experienced anything this big
recently,'' he said.
   Although governing Liberal Democratic Party leaders say they will
win at least 54 seats of the 126 to be decided Sunday, analysts see
that as a tough goal to reach.
   The party has lost its popularity because of an
influence-peddling stock scandal, a new and unpopular sales tax, and
reports that Prime Minister Sousuke Uno kept paid mistresses.
   The market has been inactive for an extended period because of
fears that an election loss by the governing party would lead to a
market plunge, Nomura said. The market expects the U.S. trade
deficit will rise, he added.
   Trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 300
million shares, up from 230 million the previous day.
   In currency dealings, yen-selling pressure remained strong since
the dollar's higher opening today, but many market participants were
reluctant to make major moves before the U.S. trade report for May,
traders said.
   The dollar was bought mainly by overseas investors, said
Yoshitsugu Hanada, trader with Mitsui Bank.
   ``It was largely because the G-7 (Group of Seven industrial
nations) meeting in Paris didn't specify an appropriate range of the
dollar,'' he said. ``Becuase they just agreed only that the dollar
should be stable against other key currencies, it inspired
dollar-buying,'' Hanada said.
   Japan wants the dollar to stay between 130-140 yen, he added.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a press conference today
that a slightly higher yen would be preferable.
   ``A slightly stronger yen would make things easier from several
points of view,'' he said.
   Although U.S. officials have indicated they are satisfied with
the current level of the dollar, Murayama said he disagrees with
that assessment.

   The dollar was firmer in early European trading
today as market participants moved to the sidelines ahead of the
8:30 a.m. EDT release of U.S. merchandise trade figures for May.
   Gold prices eased.
   Dealers said the dollar's short-term direction appears to be up,
and several said they sensed it could move higher right away if the
trade figures are better than expected.
   ``We're in an upward trend that I think only very bad trade
numbers can stop,'' said Manfred Totzauer, a vice president at
Citibank in Frankfurt. ``I have a feeling that the data will be
better than expected.''
   Dealers said the dollar was also buoyed in earlier Asian trading
after two reported rounds of intervention by the Bank of Japan
failed to slow the dollar's rise against the yen.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.82 yen to a closing 142.35 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 142.52 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.9198 West German marks, up from 1.9138; 1.6620
Swiss francs, up from 1.6540; 6.5130 French francs, up from 6.4890;
2.1603 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1580; 1,391.45 Italian lire, up
from 1,387.50; 1.1905 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   In London, the dollar gained slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.6053 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6075 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $370.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $372.20. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $369.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $369.75, down from $370.75 late
Monday.
   The Hong Kong Gold and Silver Exchange was closed today by a
typhoon.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.27 a troy ounce,
down from Monday's $5.29.

<HEAD>Founding Family Buys Back Cummins Engine Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of the founding family of
Cummins Engine Co., worldwide maker of diesel engines, have
repurchased more than 1 million shares of Cummins stock from Hanson
USA, easing the company's fears about a possible takeover.
   J. Irwin Miller, a Cummins director and former chief executive
officer, and his sister, Clementine M. Tangeman, purchased a 1.043
million-share holding of Cummins common stock for $72 million.
   The family said Monday it paid $5 million more than the going
price, based on Cummins' stock price before the purchase, to rid
itself of the uncertainty brought by the shareholder.
   Hanson, whose parent is the British conglomerate Hanson PLC which
makes Smith Corona typewriters and Farberware cookware, bought a
9.79 percent stake in Cummins in December, raising fears that the
company might move to get control of Cummins.
   Hanson officials, however, maintained that the stock had been
purchased only as an investment.
   Miller said the purchase reflects the family's confidence in the
company's future.
   ``It also reflects our conviction that the Cummins management
must be able to maintain its traditional long-term view of the
business in order to serve its customers in an era of worldwide
competition,'' Miller said.
   ``Cummins can best meet its responsibilities to its shareholders,
employees, customers, suppliers and communities alike as an
independent company,'' said Irwin, who was chief executive officer
from 1934 to 1973 and is chairman of the company's executive
committee.
   Cummins, which also makes diesel engine components and power
systems, was founded in 1919 by Will Irwin, the great uncle of
Miller and Ms. Tangeman, and by their grandmother, Linnie Sweeney.
   ``Five generations of my family were born here,'' Ms. Tangeman
said. ``I am interested in the long-term health of the company and
in having the company headquartered in Columbus, thriving and
independent.''
   Irwin's successor as chief exeuctive officer, Henry B. Schacht,
called the couple's investment ``an extraordinary vote of confidence
in Cummins' future and further proof of the wise and farsighted
stewardship that this family has provided to the company over the
past 70 years.''
   The investment nearly triples the couple's investment in the
company, according to a Cummins statement.
   The shares were exchanged with the company for $67 million
principal amount of newly issued Cummins notes. Miller, his wife,
Xenia, and Ms. Tangeman also exchanged their previous holdings of
Cummins common stock, 580,269 shares, for new Cummins preferred
stock valued at $37 million.
   Schacht said the company would try to obtain additional equity
capital from more long-term investors. The additional capital is
neeeded, he said, because of the reduction in equity involved in
issuing notes to the Miller family, the implementation of the
company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the company's intent to
implement a stock repurchase plan with ESOP proceeds.
   Also, more capital is needed to meet 1991 and 1994 federal diesel
engine emissions standards, he said.
   The company's second-quarter earnings will be released next
Monday. The company posted primary earnings of $1.61 per common
share in the first quarter of 1989.

<HEAD>Interior Secretary Considers Barring Oil Tankers From Most U.S. Ports</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS penultimate graf, `The energy ...' to CORRECT to interior,

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. is
considering barring oil tankers from most ports and requiring them
to unload at offshore ``super ports'' in an effort to prevent
spills, according to a published report.
   Lujan's plan was outlined in a speech that he was delivering
today in Long Beach, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   The speech, a copy of which was obtained in advance by the Times,
also blasted efforts to place a congressional moratorium on offshore
oil drilling and dismissed many environmental concerns against
drilling as unfounded.
   ``By imposing these moratoria,'' Lujan said, ``the Congress is
saying that we should blindly reject even the possibilities before
us, burying our heads in the sands of our ignorance.''
   On the issue of barring tankers from most of the nation's ports,
Lujan said oil could be transported inland from the ``super ports''
by undersea pipelines.
   Such a super port is already in place off the Louisiana coast,
and Lujan said similar structures could greatly reduce the risks of
oil spills in Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia and Alaska.
   Lujan spoke strongly in favor of more offshore drilling,
including off the Arctic National Refuge, a proposal that has come
under fire since the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million
gallons of oil off the coast of Alaska last March.
   The interior secretary said the nation's energy needs, set
against its apparent hostility toward future oil exploration,
represent ``a time bomb waiting to explode.''
   ``The choice we face is not between oil or the environment,'' he
said. ``It is a choice between utilizing our vast domestic energy
resources in an environmentally sound manner or holding our nation's
energy hostage to a volatile and unpredictable world.''

   A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit
claiming that more than 3,000 laid-off Detroit area General Motors
Corp. workers were entitled to $5,000 apeice in federal benefits.
   U.S. District Judge George LaPlata ruled Monday that the workers,
most of whom lost their jobs when GM phased out two factories in
Detroit in late 1987 and early 1988, were ineligible for benefits
under the federal Trade Readjustment Act.
   The Labor Department denied the benefits, saying the workers
missed a filing deadline. The United Auto Workers union, which
represented the employees, contended they were unaware of the
deadline before it passed.
   Jess Damesworth, the union's director of unemployment, said the
benefits could be worth more than $5,000 per person.
   A UAW spokesman said officials were deciding whether to appeal.

   Crude Steel production in the
non-Communist world rose by 2.8 percent to 40.1 million tons in June
from the corresponding year-earlier month, according to the
International Iron and Steel Institute.
   In the first six months of 1989, output rose by 3.7 percent to
245.35 million tons from the year-earlier period
   The June rise was led by Japan where steel companies increased
output by 5 percent to 8.96 million tons from June 1988. Production
in the United States edged up by 1.6 percent to 7.4 million tons,
while in the European Community it increased by 2.6 percent to 11.9
million tons. Among other steel producing nations, South Korea
raised output by 16 percent to 1.8 million tons.
   The 33 nations reporting their output to the Brussels-based

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The producer of Country Pride chicken has
filed suit to keep from sharing its name with a brand of cow manure
fertilizer.
   ConAgra Inc., which produces Country Pride-brand chicken, filed a
lawsuit Monday in federal court against Earthgro Inc., which
produces Country Pride-brand manure, alleging the use of the name on
fertilizer has hurt chicken sales.
   Besides cow manure, the Lebanon, Conn., company sells Country
Pride composted cow manure, dehydrated cow manure, potting soil, top
soil, peat humus and sand.
   The lawsuit says Earthgro, which owns a plant in Avondale, Pa.,
is deliberately misleading the public into associating Country Pride
cow manure with Country Pride chicken. The complaint accuses
Earthgro of infringing on ConAgra's trademark and asks the court to
prohibit the fertilizer company from using the Country Pride name.
   Timothy Sellew, co-owner of the family-owned Earthgro, said
Monday conflicting trademarks lie at the root of the disagreement.
   ConAgra received a federal trademark for the Country Pride name
in 1975, but the government also granted Earthgro the right to use
the name six years later, Sellew said.
   ``It sounds like one of those typical kind of things, the big guy
going after the little guy,'' Sellew said.
   Attorney John P. Passarelli, who represents ConAgra, said the
situation was bound to create confusion.
   ``We would simply not want our products associated with
Earthgro's product,'' Passarelli said. ``Especially considering the
nature of their product .''
   ConAgra, based in Omaha, Neb., produces such brand-name food
products as Banquet and Morton in addition to Country Pride. It had
approximately $11 billion in sales last year.

<HEAD>Insurance Firms Sue Nevada Over 15 Percent Auto Insurance Rollback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight auto insurance companies who contend
Nevada lawmakers were ``seduced'' into passing a 15 percent auto
insurance rate rollback law have challenged the newly mandated
premium reductions as unconstitutional.
   But a key lawmaker who led the drive for reduced auto insurance
rates to July 1, 1988 levels beginning this October said he had
expected Monday's suit and believes the new law can withstand the
U.S. District Court challenge.
   ``We knew it was coming,'' said Assemblyman Gene Porter, D-Las
Vegas, who initially proposed a 20 percent rollback in auto
insurance rates. ``But the U.S. government has had the power since
the 1930s ... to limit how much a company can make. What we did was
constitutional.
   ``We just can't drive them out of business.''
   Porter said a clause was put into the bill that included the 15
percent rollback to ensure companies wouldn't be forced to cut rates
if they weren't making a profit.
   That clause was added following a California Supreme Court
decision that said a 20 percent auto insurance rate rollback
approved by voters in that state's Proposition 103 couldn't rob
insurance companies of a ``fair'' rate of return, or profit.
   Dave Hill, a spokesman for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Co., one of the firms suing the state, said that language in the law
still lets the state make sure insurance companies are barely making
a profit by unconstitutionally taking away a property right.
   ``We say the legislators were politically seduced into approving
this rollback because they thought people wanted it,'' Hill said.
   ``But during hearings on the bill we showed them that almost none
of the insurance companies operating in Nevada were making any
profits by offering auto insurance. In fact, most of the companies
are losing money in that area. We lost $3 million in 1988. There was
no reason to pass this law in Nevada.''
   Hill criticized lawmakers for bypassing other insurance reform
measures that could have lowered auto insurance premiums, including
one that would have limited damages for uninsured motorists.
   Another proposal would have given drivers a choice between
regular liability insurance and no-fault policies in which damages
are paid no matter who is at fault in an accident _ but without
costly litigation.
   Under the no-fault policies, however, the right to sue for
anything other than actual damages would have been restricted.
   Nevada Insurance Commissioner David Gates, who would have to
approve any rate rollbacks under the law, wasn't available for
comment Monday. Gates is named as the principal defendant in the
suit.
   The new law was signed July 6 by Gov. Bob Miller.
   Earlier, Gates said that it appeared very few, if any, insurance
companies operating in Nevada would be forced to roll back rates
because the firms weren't earning profits on their auto policies.
   But he said the law requires every insurance company operating in
Nevada to justify its auto premium rates by refiling with his office.
   The companies suing Nevada include the largest in-state
operators, State Farm, Allstate and Farmers, along with National
Insurance Co., National Mutual, United Services Auto Association,
Safeco Insurance and Northland Insurance Co.

<HEAD>Time Stock Falls As Market Speculates on Failure of Paramount Bid</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd and 3rd grafs to UPDATE with early stock activity today.</HEAD>

   Time Inc. stock continued to fall amid the
growing belief on Wall Street that Paramount Communications Inc.'s
$12.2 billion hostile bid for the media giant is doomed and that
Time's own $14 billion offer for Warner Communications Inc. will
prevail.
   Time stock fell $1.12{ to $139.87{ a share in early New York
Stock Exchange trading today after falling $4.25 Monday and $4.75 on
Friday.
   Meanwhile, Warner stock, transformed into a takeover issue by a
Delaware court ruling last week, was up 37{ cents to $65.75 a share
early today after rising $1.12{ Monday. Paramount stock, which fell
$1.25 on Monday, slipped another 62{ cents to $55.62{ a share today.
   Delaware Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen ruled Friday that
Time could proceed with its $70-a-share offer for Warner, refusing
Paramount's request to block the deal. Paramount and some Time
shareholders are appealing the case, but Wall Street expect the
decision to stand when it reaches the Delaware Supreme Court.
   Legal scholars agree.
   ``The only basis they would have for reversing him (Allen) ...
would be on a quibbling over a factual determination,'' said James
D. Cox, a law professor at Duke University, ``But history has borne
out that he's rarely been overturned'' on factual questions.
   ``I think the opinion is pretty set,'' Cox said, although he said
a reversal by the Supreme Court was not impossible.
   John Coffee, a professor at the Columbia University School of
Law, said, ``I think the odds are very, very small that they will
overturn'' Allen's ruling.
   Allen turned down Paramount's request for an injunction against
Time's tender offer for Warner, which Paramount said would thwart
its own $200-a-share bid for Time.
   The judge disagreed with Paramount's contention that Time's board
had put the company up for sale in March when it agreed to a
stock-swap merger with Warner. Therefore, Allen ruled, the board did
not have to seriously entertain Paramount's unwanted offer.
   However, Allen delayed Time's tender offer for Warner _ which was
scheduled to expire at midnight Monday _ for 10 days to give
Paramount and the shareholders time to appeal.
   Time and Warner amended their original stock-for-stock merger
agreement to provide for the tender offer after Paramount announced
its bid last month.
   The Delaware Supreme Court will hear the case July 24 and could
rule any time after both sides make their arguments.
   Peter Appert, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence-Morgan Grenfell Inc.,
said that on Wall Street, ``most people would be willing to assume
that the (Time-Warner) transaction is a done deal.''
   Appert said it did not seem likely Allen would be overruled, and
most arbitragers, the stock speculators who scooped up Time stock
after Parmaount announced its bid, ``are not willing to make that
bet or make a big bet.''
   Time announced Monday it had extended its tender offer for Warner
until 5 p.m. July 24 in line with Allen's ruling delaying the
expiration of the bid.
   Time is offering to pay $70 a share in cash for half of Warner's
200 million outstanding shares and later exchange $70 in cash and
securities for each of the remaining shares.
   Time said that as of noon Friday, about 14.7 million Warner
shares had been tendered. Many Warner shareholders have been holding
on to their stock pending the outcome of the court case.

   Miners in western Siberia will not end their
crippling weeklong strike despite a pledge by Politburo member
Nikolai Slyunkov to increase food and consumer supplies, a spokesman
for the miners said today.
   The work stoppage in the Kuznetsk Basin in western Siberia has
spread to the nation's largest coal mining region, the Donetsk Coal
Basin in the Ukraine.
   Workers threw down their tools at two more mines in the Donetsk,
where 15 shafts are idle, a member of the strike committee said.
That job action began Saturday but was not disclosed until Monday.
   Slyunkov flew to the Kuznetsk Basin and met with the strikers
Monday night and today in an effort to resolve the walkout by more
than 112,000 miners there.
   Slyunkov addressed 30,000 people at midday in the main square of
Prokopievsk, 2,100 miles east of Moscow.
   Valery Legachev, a spokesman for the regional strike committee in
Siberia, said Slyunkov promised to increase food and consumer
supplies. But Legachev said miners there were continuing their
walkout because Slyunkov was not specific.
   In Moscow, the Supreme Soviet speeded up work on legislation on
resolving labor conflicts.
   The offical news agency Tass carried a report denying that the
third-largest coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, was also on
strike.
   In the first Kremlin comment on the strike, Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov said Monday that it threatened production at some
metallurgical and power plants.
   Weekend press reports said coal production had been cut by 1
million tons and a coal shortage had interrupted work at the
Magnitka steel complex in the Ural Mountains.
   In meetings with strikers, Slyunkov promised higher pay for night
work, longer vacations and a doubling of the wholesale price of
coal, the government newspaper Izvestia reported in today's editions.
   But the strike committee spokesman said the promises lacked
substance and the miners would stay out until all their demands were
met.
   ``We are determined to go on with the strike because they
received no concrete documented response to their demands,''
Legachev said. ``There were only general statements.
   ``He promised to increase the area's regular food supplies by 20
to 30 percent, as well as soap and washing powder,'' Legachev said.
   The miners from Prokopievsk and eight other towns in the Kuznetz
Basin are demanding greater economic autonomy from the Moscow-based
Coal Mining Ministry.
   In Makeyevka, in the Donetsk region, strike committee leader
Vladimir Komissaruk said the strike spread today to two more mines.
   ``It is like a chain reaction,'' Komissaruk said in a telephone
interview from strike committee headquarters.
   Miners in the Donetsk Basin, or Donbass, are demanding a 40
percent wage increase for night work, improved living conditions, a
fixed day off and retirement after 20 years of underground work.
They also demanded that the mining ministry trim its managerial
staff.
   No law deals with industrial strikes, which were suppressed in
the Soviet Union before the reforms launched by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev four years ago.
   Underground journals have described work stoppages that were far
shorter and not as widespread as the coal strike, which appeared to
be the worst labor unrest in the Soviet Union since the turbulence
of the 1920s.
   A draft law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts is being
pushed through the Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass said today.
   The draft was being studied by the Committee on Legislation,
Legality and Law and Order, which received the proposed legislation
Monday, Tass said.
   ``Their opinion is that the draft will furnish a legal basis for
a resolution of labor conflicts, including the current large-scale
coal miners strike,'' Tass said.

<HEAD>Administration Sees Continued Growth, Warns Congress on Deficit.</HEAD>

   The Bush administration predicted today that
economic growth will be slower and interest rates higher than in its
earlier projections.
   However, it said the federal budget deficit would be lower this
year than had been expected and that Congress can meet next year's
deficit-reduction targets _ if it sticks to its promises.
   ``We believe the economy is healthy and we believe growth will
continue but at a somewhat slower pace,'' Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady said at a news briefing.
   Although the administration prediction of 2.7 percent growth this
year and 2.6 percent next year was still more optimistic than many
other forecasters, including the Congressional Budget Office, Brady
said it was realistic.
   ``The administration remains confident of the future course of
the U.S. Economy,'' said Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's
Council of Economic Advisers.
   White House budget director Richard Darman announced that the
federal deficit in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, is
now projected at $148.3 billion, down sharply from the $164 billion
the administration was predicting in February.
   A $13 billion increase in expected tax receipts accounts for most
of the drop.
   For the 1990 fiscal year starting Oct. 1, however, Darman warned
Congress that it will violate the constraints of the Gramm-Rudman
law unless it more carefully carries out the deficit-reduction
agreement lawmakers struck with the White House earlier this year.
   If the agreement were fully implemented, Darman said, the fiscal
1990 deficit would drop to about $99.2 billion, just below the $100
billion goal contained in Gramm-Rudman. That figure includes $5.7
billion from selling federal assets _ revenue that does not count
toward Gramm-Rudman calculations.
   However, Darman said the current congressional pattern appears
headed toward a deficit of $110.5 billion _ more than $10 billion
above the Gramm-Rudman target and high enough to trigger automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts under the law.
   ``The Congress is cutting it very, very close,'' he said.
   In January, the White House projected that the economy would grow
by 3.5 percent this year, compared with the new forecast of 2.7
percent. For 1990, the growth in the gross national product is
expected to be 2.6 percent, compared with 3.4 percent predicted in
February.
   The administration predicted today that 91-day Treasury bill
rates will average 8 percent this year and 6.7 percent next year.
That compares with earlier predictions of 7.4 percent and 5.5
percent, respectively.
   Boskin said the administration expected inflation to moderate in
the second half of 1989, based on a prediction that the oil and food
price increases of earlier this year will end.
   Many outside economists and the Congressional Budget Office
considered the administration's earlier projections to be optimistic.
   Preliminary 1990 projections sent to Congress earlier this month
by CBO are more pessimistic than the White House, with economic
growth of 1.7 percent and 90-day interest rates of about 7.2 percent.
   The healthier the economy, the lower the federal deficit can be
expected to be. That is because when the economy is performing well,
the government collects more taxes, pays fewer social benefits to
people out of work and pays lower interest rates on the money it
borrows.
   The fiscal 1990 budget approved by Congress in May was written
one month after congressional leaders and Bush administration
officials reached a deal claiming to reduce next year's deficit to
$99.4 billion.
   Many of the savings _ such as no longer counting the Postal
Service's expected $2 billion in losses for next year in budget
calculations _ have been criticized as illusory.

<TEXT>
   Nationwide strikes by hundreds of thousands of
employees today shut down the train system, the London subway, 37
ports and city libraries and day-care centers.
   The stoppages are part of a wave of union militancy confronting
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government as it
tries to halt inflation topping 8 percent.
   The rail and subway strike is the fifth joint 24-hour stoppage in
five weeks. Hopes were raised Monday that the rail strike could be
averted when a second British Rail union accepted an 8.8 percent
wage increase.
   The 17,500-member train crews' union, the Associated Society of
Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, accepted the offer and called off
its ban on working overtime and days off.
   However, the third and biggest union, the National Union of
Railwaymen, rejected it late Monday night, holding out for a
10-percent raise for its 75,000 members.
   The union's general secretary, Jimmy Knapp, told reporters the
offer was simply not enough.
   Rail workers are among Britain's lowest paid industrial
employees, with average earnings, including overtime, of $471 a week
for drivers and $325 for the rest.
   Transport Minister Paul Channon called the decision
``irresponsible.''
   ``I think people will be utterly astonished and totally fed up,''
he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher came to office 10 years ago declaring that the
battle against inflation was her prime economic aim. But the annual
inflation rate, at 8.3 percent against 4.9 percent a year ago, is
the highest in the 12-nation European Economic Community.
   The 10,500 striking London subway workers are also among the
lowest paid industrial staff. They want a $102 weekly pay raise to
operate subway trains without conductors.
   Management has offered $48 plus extra vacation, but is demanding
increased production.
   The National Association of Port Employers said an indefinite
strike that began among 9,400 dockworkers at 60 ports around Britain
on July 10 is crumbling. The association's spokesman Iain Dale said
that just 37 of the 60 ports are now halted and that the other 23
are working normally.
   The dockworkers are striking over he government's abolition at
the 60 ports of a legally enforced scheme dating back to 1947 that
guaranteed them work. Britain's other 102 ports are unaffected by
the strike.
   Also on strike were more than 500,000 members of the National and
Local Government Officers Association, halting municipal services
across the country.
   The workers earn an average of about $16,000 a year. They want a
12 percent pay raise. Their employers have offered 7 percent.

   Congressional negotiators today narrowed the
issues separating them on a bailout plan for the savings and loan
industry to junk bonds, who will regulate 1,200 state-chartered S&amp;Ls
and how will the rescue be financed.
   ``We are prepared to move a very substantial distance toward the
positions you insist on,'' House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, told Sens. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., Jake Garn,
R-Utah, and Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   The House conferees had agreed among themselves Wednesday to bow
to Senate demands giving regulators more control over the activities
S&amp;Ls can engage in and ability to suspend, under certain conditions,
federal insurance coverage of insolvent institutions.
   Gonzalez today presented to the Senate negotiators the House's
broad counterproposal to a Senate plan last week that bowed to
tougher House language on making S&amp;L owners put more of their own
money at risk and making the industry pay for new low-income housing
initiatives.
   ``It looks to me to be a very constructive proposal,'' said
Riegle, who as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee is the chief
Senate negotiator in the bargaining.
   Garn said he still opposes House demands that S&amp;Ls disinvest in
junk bonds within two years and that the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., rather than the Treasury Department, be put in charge of
regulating state-chartered but federally insured thrifts.
   ``I can't find a single institution that has failed because of
junk bonds,'' Garn said, contending the House language would cause
``considerable losses'' because a fire sale of junk bonds would
lower the price that S&amp;Ls could command for them to 60 cents or 70
cents on the dollar.
   But he raised no initial objection to making M. Danny Wall, his
former aide and now the government's chief S&amp;L regulator, face new
confirmation hearings in order to keep his job, as the House is
demanding.
   With S&amp;L losses mounting at a rate of $10 million to $12 million
a day, the cost of the bailout already has mushroomed by $5 billion
since Bush outlined his proposal last February. The cost of the
biggest financial rescue since the Depression is estimated at $157
billion.
   The process was slowed last week when Senate conferees presented
a comprehensive package adopting most of the House's tougher capital
requirements on S&amp;Ls and accepting its demand for new
industry-financed housing subsidies.
   The House conferees said Monday they would offer to require that
Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and William L.
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., face new
confirmation hearings.
   Bush appointed Seidman to take over management of the crisis from
Wall last February when he proposed the rescue legislation to cover
some $100 billion in industry losses of government-insured S&amp;L
deposits.
   However, the president also proposed making Wall head of the new
Office of Thrift Supervision in the Treasury Department that is to
replace the Home Loan Bank Board as the industry's chief regulator.
   Although Seidman is widely praised as the best official available
to untangle the S&amp;L mess, the chief of the House negotiators,
Gonzalez proposed Monday that Seidman and Wall face new confirmation
trials.
   ``In this way, the performance of both the FDIC and Bank Board
incumbent would be subject to review, and certainly parallel
treatment is fair,'' said Gonzalez.
   As chairman of the House Banking Committee, Gonzalez has blamed
Wall as a major contributor to the escalation of the S&amp;L crisis by
underestimating its magnitude in 1987 and 1988.
   Wall, however, has support from Garn, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Banking Committee. Wall was director of the Senate
committee's staff from 1981 through 1986 when Garn was its chairman
and his wife is now the senator's personal secretary.
   House negotiators rejected the Senate's proposal to put
state-chartered thrifts _ which have been blamed for a large part of
the crisis _ under the regulation of the new office that Wall might
assume.
   Instead, they insisted Monday that Seidman be put in control of
state-chartered S&amp;Ls while the new Treasury office assumes
responsibility for regulating federally chartered thrifts.
   The House conferees also agreed Monday to adopt tougher Senate
language restricting business activities of state-chartered thrifts
and giving the FDIC authority to suspend deposit insurance if an S&amp;L
has no tangible capital.
   But they could not agree on how to reconcile the way junk bonds
are treated. The House wants to make S&amp;Ls dispose of all junk bonds
within two years. The Senate last week proposed cutting how much of
an S&amp;L's deposits can be invested in the high-yield securities from
the 11 percent now allowed to 6 percent.
   The biggest issue still dividing the two sides is over financing
the immediate $50 billion needed to pay off depositors in failed
institutions.
   Bush and the Senate would do it through 30-year private bonds to
avoid swelling the federal deficit while the House would have the
Treasury borrow the money directly but exempt it from Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction targets.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Widens to $10.24 Billion in May</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 4th graf pvs, May's trade, to UPDATE with
Mosbacher comment.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened dramatically in
May to $10.24 billion, the biggest imbalance in five months, as
America's appetite for foreign goods rebounded sharply, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the May deficit figure represented a
23.6 percent increase from a revised imbalance of $8.29 billion in
April, when the nation registered the lowest monthly trade gap in
more than four years.
   The deterioration in May reflected a sharp 4.3 percent increase
in imports to a new high of $40.71 billion and a 0.9 percent drop in
sales of U.S. goods abroad. Analysts had been expecting the deficit
to widen in May, but only to about $9 billion.
   May's trade gap was the biggest since a $10.8 billion deficit
recorded last December.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the May figure was
disappointing, but he added that ``we are encouraged by the
continuing strength of exports.''
   ``Exports, while off slightly in May, continued at near record
levels of over $30 billion for the third month in a row,'' Mosbacher
said. ``This is an encouraging trend, and reflects continued success
by American companies in expanding foreign markets.''
   Economist Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm,
said the increase in May was partly a bounceback from an
artificially low number in April, but he said the monthly trade
deficits are likely to rise gradually for the rest of the year.
   ``I wouldn't say this was a fluke or that it's going to get
better again,'' Evans said. ``I think it's a harbinger of things to
come.''
   Even with the spurt in May, the trade gap for the first five
months of the year was running at an annual rate of $111.1 billion,
below the actual 1988 deficit of $118.53 billion.
   Last year's figure represented a dramatic 22.1 percent
improvement over 1987, when the trade deficit hit an all-time high
of $152.12 billion, and accounted for almost half of all U.S.
economic growth in 1988.
   Analysts have been predicting the slowing of the U.S. economy
could help hold down this year's deficit by curbing domestic demand
for imports. But they also warn that the recent strength of the U.S.
dollar against foreign currencies could stunt further progress on
the trade gap.
   In May, imports reached a new high as increases were recorded in
virtually every major category except autos. Imports of agricultural
products jumped 10.7 percent.
   Petroleum imports shot up 17.3 percent to $4.75 billion as the
price of a barrel of oil rose to $18.40, up from $17.83 in April.
The volume of oil imports also rose in May, reaching 8.33 million
barrels a day, up from 7.57 million a day in April.
   U.S. exports, meanwhile, fell to a seasonally adjusted $30.47
billion in May as sales declined in most major categories. Exports
of consumer goods dropped 5.7 percent.
   As usual, the United States posted its largest trade deficit in
May with Japan, a $4.28 billion shortfall that was up from $3.89
billion in April.
   The nation posted a small $78.3 million trade deficit with
Western Europe after posting surpluses in both March and April.
   The imbalance with Canada, the largest U.S. trading partner, was
$739.3 million in May, up from $174.8 million in April.
   Other large deficits in May were recorded with Taiwan, $1.09
billion; South Korea, $503 million; and Mexico, $452 million.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said in advance of today's report that if the slowing of
U.S. economic growth continues, ``the trend would be toward
narrowing the trade deficit.''
   However, Dederick cautioned that gains on the trade front could
be held back by the stronger dollar, which would make it more
difficult for American manufacturers to competitively market their
products to other industrial nations.
   ``The foreign markets are there and expanding,'' Dederick said.
``The question is whether we, given the strength of the dollar, will
be able to maintain our share.''
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, is trying to strengthen
exports and spur economic growth at home by aggressively pushing
foreign countries to open their markets to more U.S. goods.
   At the just-concluded economic summit in Paris, leaders of the
world's seven most powerful democracies said that while progress had
been made in reducing imbalances in world trade, ``the momentum of
adjustment has recently weakened markedly.''
   In their final communique, the leaders pledged action to bring
down the trade deficits in the United States, Canada and Italy. At
the same time, they urged West Germany and Japan to take steps to
boost consumer demand for imports and thus help reduce their
partners' trade deficits.
   The leaders warned that trade ``protectionism remains a real
threat. We strongly reaffirm our determination to fight it in all
its forms.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said the heavy rains soaking Iowa and parts of the upper
Midwest weighed heavily on corn prices at the opening bell and
soybeans started trending lower in sympathy.
   November soybeans flirted with the contract low set about a month
ago and prospects for improvement were not good. A wave of selling
is expected as traders move to comply with last week's BOT emergency
order requiring market players to reduce their positions in the July
contract to 3 million bushels by the close of trading today.
   The order, widely interpreted as the exchange's reaction to the
large soybean position built by Italian agribusiness giant Ferruzzi
SpA, calls for traders to be down to 1 million bushels when the July
contract goes off the board Thursday.
   Only wheat managed to escape the price deluge early and traders
said if corn and beans continue sliding, wheat prices likely will
give way as well.
   On the open, wheat was { cent to 3 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.87 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 9\ cents lower, with July at $2.42{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cent
to 3 cents lower, with September at $1.46 a bushel; and soybeans
were 3{ cents higher to 11\ cents lower, with July at $6.81 a bushel.
   Livestock and cattle futures opened mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .27 cent lower, with August at 72.65
cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .30 cent lower, with
August at 83.72 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .30 cent
lower, with July at 47.50 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were .45 cent lower to .13 cent higher, with July at 29.20 cents a
pound.

<TEXT>
   United Airlines announced today that it is seeking
approval to enter the European market with service from four U.S.
cities.
   ``With today's announcement, United has moved decisively toward
becoming a trans-Atlantic carrier,'' United Chairman and President
Stephen M. Wolf said in a statement.
   The nation's second-largest air carrier said it filed petitions
for its proposed European routes today with the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
   Wolf said United will begin flying next spring between its
Chicago and Washington, D.C., hubs to Frankfurt and Paris. It also
will initiate flights between Chicago and Milan with continuing
service to Rome.
   Last month, United said it was seeking to begin service between
Chicago and Warsaw, with continuing service to Budapest.
   The airline has asked for authority to link Paris with both San
Francisco and New York. United currently has approval to fly between
those U.S. cities and Frankfurt, but does not fly the routes.
   Wolf said United will seek government approval to fly between
London and San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and New York. In
addition, the company will seek permission to fly between Glasgow,
Scotland and both Chicago and Washington.
   ``Within a year, we expect to have a presence in several of the
major transporation centers of Europe, and we will build
aggressively upon that base,'' he said.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 10.43 points at

   Investors signed a pact to complete the $1.6
billion buyout of the CNW Corp. and say they have tendered offers
for 98.6 percent of the company's outstanding common shares.
   The buyout group, formed by investment banker Blackstone Group
and CNW management, said Monday it has accepted for payment up to 91
percent of all validly tendered common and preferred shares.
   Under an agreement reached in June, the buyout group, known as
Chicago and North Western Acquisition Corp., offered to pay $45.50
cash per common share.
   At the time, New York's Chemical Bank committed $585 million in
buyout financing and the New York investment firm of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. agreed to provide up to $475 million in
financing.
   CNW Corp. is the parent of the Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co., a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that
operates in nine states, most of them in the Midwest. It also has
commuter lines in the Chicago area.
   The buyout group said 98.6 percent of the company's outstanding
common shares had been tendered before its offer expired on Friday.
   Officials say Blackstone's financing structure will not require
significant sales of operating assets to retire the debt caused by
the takeover. But the firm will complete CNW's previously announced
plan to sell its Chicago-area commuter operations and will divest
some real estate and surplus equipment.
   The buyout offer prompted a hostile suitor, New York-based
Japonica Partners, to withdraw its own bid to acquire CNW.

<HEAD>Profit Rises at Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber; Down at Morgan Stanley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. said Tuesday its second-quarter earnings
jumped 31 percent while another major investment firm, PaineWebber
Group Inc., posted a $15.1 million profit after only breaking even
for the same quarter a year ago.
   Both firms cited improved market conditions.
   A third investment firm, Morgan Stanley Group Inc., said its
second-quarter fell 17.1 percent from record results a year earlier
but still was its second best quarterly performance ever.
   Merrill Lynch, the brokerage, underwriting and investment
services giant based in New York, said it earned $70.2 million, or
62 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with
$53.5 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Total revenue rose 26 percent to a record $3.1 billion from $2.5
billion a year earlier. Excluding interest and dividends, revenue
rose 12 percent.
   William A. Schreyer, chairman and chief executive, and Daniel P.
Tully, president, said the firm's consumer market business had solid
revenue increases in virtually all of its operations, while its
capital markets business retained the top ranking among the world's
debt and equity underwriters.
   Commission revenue rose 18 percent to $462 million, reflecting
higher equity trading volume and increased sales of money market
instruments. Revenue from trading and other activities in its own
portfolio rose 3 percent to $462 million, while interest and
dividend revenue rose to 51 percent to $1.39 billion.
   Investment banking revenue fell 8 percent in the quarter to $234
million, reflecting lower levels of equity underwritings.
   Nonetheless, Merrill Lynch said it boosted its underwriting
market share for domestic issues to 17.7 percent from 15 percent
during the first half of the year and for worldwide offerings to
10.2 percent from 9.4 percent. It said it ranked first in both
categories.
   For the first six months of the year, Merrill Lynch profit fell
11.8 percent to $107.4 million, or 93 cents a share, from $121.7
million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier. First-half total
revenue increased 25 percent to $6.1 billion from $4.9 billion a
year earlier.
   PaineWebber, also based in New York, said it earned $15.1
million, or 33 cents a share, in the second quarter compared with
earnings of $159,000 a year earlier. There were no per-share
earnings last year after deducting preferred stock dividends.
   Revenue including interest for the quarter rose 8 percent to $433
million from $400 million a year ago.
   ``PaineWebber's results reflect better market conditions combined
with our progress in improving the fundamental economics of the
firm,'' said Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive.
   For the first six months, PaineWebber said it earned $24.3
million, or 44 cents per share, up 16.3 percent from $20.9 million,
or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. First-half revenue rose 19.7
percent to $1.40 billion from $1.17 billion a year earlier.
   New York-based Morgan Stanley said it earned $112.1 million, or
$2.83 a share, for the quarter, down from $135.3 million, or $3.52 a
share, a year earlier.
   Total revenue rose 44.8 percent to $1.52 billion from $1.05
billion. Net revenue after deducting interest expense rose 2.1
percent to $631.6 million from $619.4 million a year earlier.
   Morgan Stanley reported higher revenue from most of its
activities, although investment revenue for its own account fell to
$51.4 million from $124.2 million..
   But the latest results included a pre-tax revenue gain of $51.5
million from the restructuring of the firm's investments in two
companies, Essex Group Inc. and Silgan Corp., while last year's
results included a similar gain of $123.7 million from the sale of
its investment in Cain Chemical Inc.
   For the first six months, Morgan Stanley earned $193.3 million,
or $4.86 a share, down 17.4 percent from $233.9 million, or $6.07 a
share, a year earlier.
   First-half total revenue rose 36.1 percent to $2.75 billion from
$2.02 billion. But net revenue after deducting interest expense fell
1.7 percent to $1.17 billion from $1.19 billion.

   Share prices ended slightly lower Tuesday on the
London Stock Exchange, as the market absorbed news that the U.S.
trade deficit widened in May as did Britian's government deficit for
June.
   Trading closed at an hour earlier than usual, due to a 24-hour
strike by British public transport workers.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down 1.8
points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,273.1.
   Volume came to 418.8 million shares, compared with 513.5 million
shares on Monday.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 3.1 points to 1,883.3.
The Financial Times 500-share index fell 0.39 point to close at
1,285.27.
   ``The market was weakened by the U.S. trade report but managed to
comeback slightly during the afternoon,'' one trader said.
   The U.S. trade gap widened to $10.24 billion in May from $8.26
billion in April. Analysts had expected a May deficit of about $9
billion.
   In addition, the British public sector borrowing requirement, the
most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or surplus,
showed a deficit of 695 million pounds, or $1.1 billion, in June.
The May deficit had been 321 million pounds.

<HEAD>Earnings More Than Double At MCI And Parent Of US Sprint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-distance business was good to AT&amp;T's chief rivals in the
second quarter, as MCI Communications Corp. and the parent of US
Sprint Communications Co. both reported Tuesday that profits more
than doubled.
   MCI has grabbed about 12 percent of the long-distance market and
US Sprint 8 percent as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s share
has steadily eroded to about 68 percent. A variety of smaller
companies split the rest.
   MCI said its net income grew 142 percent on a 31 percent gain in
revenue that was helped by the availability of new services.
   MCI said it was competing more effectively in the $4 billion
operator services market because of expanded services since April 1
that enable customers to make collect, third-party-billed, and
person-to-person calls.
   MCI also began competing April 1 for long-distance customers of
pay phones, once a monopoly of No. 1 American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. During the quarter it won its largest contract to date, a $150
million award from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. for voice and data
transmission.
   Washington-based MCI said it earned $150 million, or 56 cents a
share, compared to $62 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $1.59 billion from $1.22 billion.
   For the first half, MCI earned $285 million, or $1.07 a share, up
from $120 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
to $3.09 billion from $2.35 billion.
   Daniel F. Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer, said the
company's $6 billion investment in its network has started to pay
off. The company has posted eight consecutive quarters of record
profit and revenue, he said.
   United Telecommunications Inc., the Kansas City, Mo.-based
majority owner of US Sprint, said the long-distance unit contributed
$48.1 million in operating income in the quarter as it posted its
first billion-dollar quarter, with $1.04 billion in revenue.
   A year earlier US Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance company, had an
operating loss of $98.3 million on revenue of $799 million.
   The turnaround at US Sprint led to a 121 percent profit increase
for the parent company, which also provides local phone service in
19 states, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest.
   United Telecom said its earnings rose to $90.5 million, or 86
cents a share, from $41 million, or 40 cents a share, a year
earlier. Companywide revenue rose to $1.85 billion from $1.56
billion.
   For the first six months, net income rose to $166.9 million, or
$1.59 a share, from $75.4 million, or 73 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $3.62 billion from $3.05 billion.
   In coming months US Sprint should benefit from its part-ownership
of a trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable and from its participation in
a federal government phone contract, it said. The contract will make
the U.S. government into the company's biggest customer.

<HEAD>Bass Group Increases Stake In Longview Fibre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert M. Bass Group Inc. has increased
its stake in Longview Fibre Co. to 7 percent, the investor group
said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In the filing Monday, the Bass group said it had bought 462,000
shares of the timber and paper products company between May 16 and
July 14 at prices ranging between $63.08 and $74.22 a share.
   The group now has 776,400 shares. Before the purchases, it held
2.85 percent of Longview Fibre, the filing said.
   The filing said the purchases were made for investment purposes,
and that the group may buy more shares. No takeover of the
Longview-based company was planned, it said.
   Longview Fibre's stock rose 50 cents to $72.25 a share Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange, giving the company a market value of
nearly $796.6 million. Nearly 100,000 shares were traded, more than
double the normal daily volume.
   Ray McDermott, Longview Fibre senior vice president, said the
company had no comment on the Bass group purchases. He said the
company did adopt anti-takeover provisions on March 1, but not in
anticipation of any takeover threat.
   Longview Fibre owns and operates tree farms in Oregon and
Washington that produce logs for sale, and owns a pulp and paper
mill that manufactures kraft paper and containerboard. It also owns
15 plants in 10 states that produce shipping containers and grocery
bags.
   For fiscal year 1988, Longview Fibre had net earnings of $96.33
million, or $8.71 a share, up 48 percent from the $65.17 million, or
$5.80 a share, in 1987. Net sales were $657.21 million for 1988 and
$569.4 million for 1987.

<TEXT>
   BellSouth Corp., one of the seven U.S. regional
telephone companies once owned by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., said Tuesday it was forming a consortium with General Electric
Co. PLC and Plessey Co. PLC to bid for a personal communications
network license in Britain.
   The Department of Trade and Industry intends to grant two or
three such licenses, perhaps by the end of the year. They will allow
operators to offer two-way communications anywhere in Britain using
lightweight handsets.
   The three companies have signed a memorandum of understanding,
which gives both GEC and Plessey a 30 percent stake in the venture,
and Atlanta-based BellSouth a 20 percent holding. The remaining
equity will be reserved to be taken up later, possibly by other
partners.
   GEC and Plessey, through its already existing GPT joint venture,
will design the system while BellSouth, the world's largest provider
of mobile communication services, will provide operation expertise.
   The announcement didn't say how much money each company would
devote to the venture.
   GEC is unrelated to General Electric Co. of the United States.

<HEAD>Troubled Arizona Thrift Announces `Turnaround Plan'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MeraBank officials said Tuesday they would lay off
an unspecified number of employees, sell three subsidiaries and
repossessed real estate and make changes in loan policy as part of a
financial turnaround plan for the money-losing thrift.
   ``We will accelerate the streamlining of operations, return to
the basic business of a federally insured depository of savings
accounts and become a major buyer of high-quality, low-risk home
mortgages in the future,'' MeraBank chairman Gene Rice said in a
prepared statement.
   MeraBank lost $209 million in 1988 and $29 million in the first
quarter of this year, and a 13,000-member group of stockholders of
its parent company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., urged last month
that MeraBank be spun off.
   Pinnacle West also owns Phoenix-based Arizona Public Service Co.,
the state's largest electric utility.
   Included in the Phoenix-based thrift's cost-cutting measures is
the layoff of an unspecified number of employees over five-year
period, Rice's statement said. He said the layoffs reflect the
economic condition of the marketplace.
   Mesa radio station KFNN said it was told by Rice that MeraBank
was laying off 160 people, including 150 in Arizona and 10 in Texas.
   MeraBank plans to sell three subsiduaries _ Sacramento,
Calif.-based FIA Associates Inc., which buys and manages real estate
for pension funds; MeraTeach Inc. a data processing service company
in Dallas and Phoenix, and Meracor Insurance Corp., a Phoenix
insurance agency.
   Rice also said MeraBank plans to sell off repossessed real estate
in ``an orderly manner.''
   While the plan is expected to reduce annual overhead to $80
million from $148 million within five years, MeraBank still expects
to continue to lose money because of non-performing loans until the
real estate market recovers, Rice said.
   Under the new plan, MeraBank will only make loans secured by
savings, he said.
   ``New applications will not be taken for residential, commercial,
construction, real estate, or consumer loans,'' Rice said.
   Federal regulators are demanding that Pinnacle West pump an
additional $180 million into MeraBank to guarantee against
insolvency, and the Arizona Corporation Commission last Wednesday
temporarily capped what APS can pay out in dividends to Pinnacle
West.
   The commission acted even though Pinnacle West and APS executives
had promised that APS would not be raided for money needed by
MeraBank.
   On June 29, Pinnacle West announced it and MeraBank had formed
committees of their boards of directors to negotiate with regulators
and to study restructuring options that include possible disposition
of MeraBank.
   Pinnacle West bought MeraBank in December 1986 for $426 million.

<HEAD>Wheat Higher, Soybeans Mixed and Corn Lower in Weather-Driven Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures closed higher, soybeans were mixed
and corn fell sharply Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   As in Monday's market, weather was at center stage in all three
pits.
   Because corn is in its most critical growing stage, heavy rains
in the Corn Belt were viewed as favorable to crop production and
prices in that pit opened under pressure and were lower all day.
   Wheat, however, was bolstered by forecasts for drier weather in
the Plains states and better-than-expected export business and
managed to stay on the upside through most of the session.
   Soybeans started the day lower in sympathy with the losses in
corn, but large buying by several commercial brokers enabled
old-month soybeans to rebound in light volume.
   November soybeans flirted with a contract low set last month, but
there was less selling than expected Tuesday in light of a BOT
emergency order last week requiring market players to reduce their
positions in the July contract to 3 million bushels by the close of
trading.
   The order, widely interpreted as the exchange's reaction to the
large soybean position built by Italian agribusiness giant Ferruzzi
S.p.A., calls for traders to be down to 1 million bushels when the
July contract goes off the board Thursday.
   On the close, wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.87{ a bushel; corn was { cent to
6\ cents lower, with July at $2.47 a bushel; oats were { cent to 3{
cents higher, with September at $1.42 a bushel; and soybeans were 9{
cents lower to 19{ cents higher, with July at $6.97 a bushel.

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food conglomerate ConAgra Inc. said Tuesday
its fourth quarter profit rose 42 percent from a year earlier.
   The company said it earned $65.4 million, or 80 cents per share,
in the three months ended May 28, compared with $46.2 million, or 58
cents per share, in the previous year.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.97 billion from $2.6 billion.
   ConAgra in June agreed to terminate a lengthy takeover battle
against Tyson Foods Inc. for Holly Farms Corp., one of the nation's
biggest poultry processors. ConAgra, which earlier had reached a
merger agreement with Holly Farms that was challenged by Tyson, will
receive $50 million from the companies for agreeing to drop out of
the bidding.
   For the full year, net income rose 28 percent to $197.9 million,
or $2.45 a share, from $154.7 million, or $1.94 a share, a year
earlier.
   Full-year sales gained 18 percent to $11.34 billion from $9.61
billion.
   In ConAgra's largest industry segment, Prepared Foods, operating
profit increased 43 percent to $293.1 million in fiscal 1989 from
$205 million in 1988. Sales increased 15 percent to $7.08 billion
from $6.13 billion.
   ConAgra is one of the nation's biggest food and agricultural
companies, selling poultry, frozen foods, processed meats, pet food,
fertilizer and animal feed under brand names that include Armour,
Banquet and Country Pride. The company also has major interests in
grain processing, finance and international trading.

   Stock prices sagged today, weighed down by the
government's report of a bigger-than-expected trade deficit.
   The Commerce Department said the nation's merchandise trade
deficit rose to $10.24 billion in April, well above expectations of
a $9 billion gap.
   The trade report contributed to weakness in the dollar, which
carried over to the bond market and then to the stock market.
   Today's decline was the second in a row after nine consecutive
days of increases, but both Monday's drop and today's were
relatively small.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Down in U.S., Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar lost value against most major
currencies in U.S. dealings that were hectic at times Tuesday as
traders reacted to an unexpectedly poor report on the U.S. trade
performance.
   Earlier, on foreign exchange markets abroad, the dollar finished
mixed.
   Gold prices moved modestly higher at home after a mixed showing
overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose $1.60 to $372.60 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank
of New York quoted a bid of $371.90 for an ounce of bullion at 4
p.m. EDT, up $1.60 from Monday's late bid.
   Simon Fischer, a vice president at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said
currency trading was brisk immediately after the Commerce Department
reported the country's merchandise trade deficit widened sharply to
a seasonally adjusted $10.24 billion in May from $8.29 billion in
April.
   It had been widely predicted that the May deficit would be around
$9 billion.
   News in the report that imports grew 4.3 percent to a record
$40.71 billion in May implied that the U.S. economy remains strong
because it is drawing in vast quantities of foreign goods.
   This point fed bullish sentiment toward the dollar because it
suggested that the Federal Reserve Board might be less inclined to
drive down interest rates. High U.S. interest rates have supported
the dollar by making earnings on dollar-denominated investments
attractive.
   Tempering the bullishness was speculation that the Bush
administration might favor a lower dollar _ and wish to promote its
decline through interest rate manipulation _ to help bring the trade
deficit down.
   Trading volume dwindled as the day went by, with the dollar
finishing lower against most currencies except the Japanese yen and
the Canadian dollar.
   Fischer said in the afternoon traders started to even out their
currency holdings so they might be able to make profits Wednesday no
matter which way the dollar moves in response to the Consumer Price
Index report for June.
   Before the trade report was released, the dollar had strengthened
in Tokyo to close at 142.35 Japanese yen, up from 141.53 yen late
Monday. Later, in London, the dollar traded at 141.70 yen, and, in
New York, the dollar closed at 141.50 yen, up slightly from 141.43
yen on Monday.
   The British pound strengthened against the dollar. In London, one
pound cost $1.6255 late Tuesday compared to Monday's $1.6075.
Sterling fetched $1.6235 in New York vs. $1.6150 on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8960 West German marks, down from 1.9030; 1.6430
Swiss francs, down from 1.6445; 6.4325 French francs, down from
6.4555; 1,372.00 Italian lire, down from 1,380.00; and, 1.19115
Canadian dollars, up from 1.19065.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Monday's late
levels included: 1.8920 West German marks, down from 1.9138; 1.6395
Swiss francs, down from 1.6540; 6.4175 French francs, down from
6.4890; 2.1505 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1580; 1,379.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,387.50; and 1.1907 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1905.
   In the gold markets, the late bid for bullion fell 25 cents a
troy ounce to $372.20 in London, but rose 75 cents an ounce to
$371.50 in Zurich.
   Gold had closed earlier in Hong Kong at $369.75 an ounce, down
from $371.05 on Monday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.27 a troy
ounce, down from $5.29. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery closed at $5.242 a troy ounce, down from Monday's
settlement price of $5.263.

<HEAD>Market Weakens in Anticipation of More Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices fell Tuesday, weakened by trader
expectations of more crude and gasoline supplies reaching the market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark grade of oil, fell 11 cents
a barrel to $20.34.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale unleaded
gasoline for August delivery fell 1.02 cent a gallon to 56.06 cents,
and wholesale home-heating oil for August delivery fell 0.05 cent a
gallon to 50.50 cents.
   Andrew Lebow, a broker at the New York energy futures firm
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc., attributed the weakness
partly to high gasoline production, which has led to a surplus along
the East Coast and Gulf Coast.
   ``I think what's happened is that refiners have been able to
produce much more gasoline than many analysts had figured,'' Lebow
said. Wholesale gasoline prices now have dropped by about 23 cents a
gallon from the spring high.
   Others said the market weakness reflected anticipation that the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly statistical report would
continue to show a big growth in supplies of oil and refined
products.

   A worse-than-expected trade deficit undermined
the stock market Tuesday, driving the Dow Jones industrial average
to a second decline after a nine-day rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 8.73 points to
2,544.76.
   The Commerce Department announced before the market opened that
the nation's merchandise trade deficit rose to $10.24 billion in
May, well above expectations of a $9 billion gap.
   The trade report undercut the dollar, which carried over to
weakness in bonds. The stock market opened lower and never recovered.
   Some analysts said the stock market showed underlying strength by
holding up as well as it did.
   ``It gives ground grudgingly. There's still lots of cash on the
sidelines,'' said Alan Ackerman, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst in New York.
   ``For a necessary pause that refreshes, this just isn't that
dangerous,'' agreed Lawrence Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Still, two down sessions in a row have put a chill on the July
rally, which saw the Dow Jones average rise 114.76 from the end of
June through last Friday's close.
   Tuesday's market decline, although modest, was more pronounced
than Monday's, when the Dow Jones industrial average slipped just
1.33 and advancing stocks narrowly outnumbered declining ones.
   On Tuesday decliners outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
618 up, 850 down and 540 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.35 million
shares, up from 131.96 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 187.14 million shares.
   Marion Laboratories led the list of most actively traded issues,
rising 1 to 34{, after the announcement Tuesday that Dow Chemical
had signed a definitive agreement to acquire 67 percent of its stock
over the next two or three years. It had gained 8\ points on word of
a tentative agreement Monday.
   More than 13 million Marion shares changed hands in composite
dealings, adding significantly to overall trading volume. Dow
Chemical, meanwhile, fell 1| at 86}.
   International Business Machines, a blue-chip bellwether, fell 1\
to 114} in spite of an earnings report that met expectations. The 39
percent quarterly gain was largely the result of special factors.
The stock had risen by an identical amount Monday.
   Apple Computer fell 1{ to 39\ in heavy over-the-counter trading
after reporting a 5.3 percent earnings gain, below market
expectations.
   Holiday, owner of Holiday Inns, jumped 6\ to 57\. A Drexel
Burnham Lambert research report said a ``golden parachute''
provision for senior executives gives them a strong incentive to
consider selling them the company later this year.
   B.F. Goodrich jumped 2] to 64. USA Today reported that Centaur
Partners, a New York investment group, and a European company other
than Hanson PLC of Britain were considering an $85-a-share takeover
offer. The stock had climbed 3\ on Monday on speculation of a bid by
Hanson.
   Warner Communications rose \ to 65|, Paramount Communications
rose } to 57, and Time fell 3 to 138. The companies are embroiled in
a three-way takeover battle.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $7.12 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.46 to 184.91.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.94 to 378.73, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index fell 1.09 to 331.35.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
2.02 to 447.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 370.17, up 0.62.

   International Business Machines Corp. on Tuesday announced a 39
percent quarterly profit increase that was swollen by a one-time
factor, while Apple Computer Inc. reported a smaller-than-expected
5.3 percent gain.
   IBM's report fell within expectations, and the stock slid back
$1.25 to $114.75 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading,
erasing its $1.25 gain from Monday. Apple took a bigger hit, sliding
$1.50 to $39.25 in late over-the-counter dealings.
   The second-quarter profit increase at IBM was unusually large
because results a year ago had been depressed by a one-time $600
million charge to cover the cost of cuts in manufacturing and
headquarters operations.
   Excluding that charge, earnings per share would have risen about
3.1 percent.
   Analysts said they were impressed by IBM's revenue growth, which
appeared to be in double digits both overseas and in the United
States, where sales had been weak. The company said sales were
growing across its product line, from personal computers to
mainframes.
   IBM Chairman John F. Akers has been moving employees into sales
and marketing jobs since 1987, which the company declared the year
of the customer.
   ``These are the first measurable results of the back-to-the-field
move,'' said Bob Djurdjevic, an analyst at Annex Research Inc. in
Phoenix.
   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said it earned $1.34 billion in the
quarter, or $2.31 a share, in comparison with earnings of $964
million, or $1.63 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.4 percent
to $15.2 billion from $13.9 billion.
   For the first six months of the year, IBM said its earnings rose
3.5 percent to $2.29 billion, or $3.92 a share, from $2.21 billion,
or $3.73 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.6 percent to $27.9
billion from $26 billion.
   Apple's results disappointed investors. Sales of most products
except the Macintosh IIcx and Macintosh SE30 are sluggish, and the
company continues to hire, resulting in a squeeze between costs and
revenue, said John McManus, an analyst at Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``They're losing some momentum in the marketplace and that
concerns me,'' he said.
   The Cupertino, Calif.-based personal computer maker said earnings
in its third fiscal quarter ended June 30 rose to $96.1 million, or
74 cents a share, from $91.3 million, or 71 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $1.25 billion from $993 million a year
earlier.
   For the first nine months, Apple said its earnings rose less than
1 percent to $293 million, or $2.28 a share, from $292 million, or
$2.24 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.9 billion from
$2.9 billion.
   Apple said it continued to be hurt by higher component costs,
especially for memory chips, which it bought when they were at their
highest price.

<HEAD>Audi Ads Say Sudden Acceleration Case Closed; Class Action Plaintiffs
Say No</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY ANDERSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Audi of America's full-page ads in dozens of
newspapers Tuesday triumphantly declared ``Case Closed'' on its
problems with sudden acceleration, but an attorney notes that a
related class action suit against the automaker remains wide open.
   ``These guys have a lot of nerve,'' said Robert F. Lisco of
Chicago, who represents plaintiffs in a suit covering up to 300,000
Audi 5000 owners seeking damages for lost resale value blamed on
sudden acceleration concerns. ``The case is not closed...''
   The ads ran nationally in the Wall Street Journal and USA Today
and in local newspapers serving the 34 top markets, said Audi
spokesman Joe Bennett in Troy, Mich.
   They note the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on
July 11 officially completed its investigation of sudden accleration
involving the Audi 5000 and determined the problem did not involve a
mechanical or electrical defect.
   The agency _ which in January 1987 noted 1,750 reports of alleged
sudden acceleration resulting in 1,269 accidents, 430 injuries and
nine deaths _ said the major cause of the problem ``appears to have
been drivers unknowingly stepping on the accelerator instead of the
brake pedal.''
   Audi's ad asks, ``Is there anyone who has not heard the rumors of
sudden acceleration in Audi? We doubt it.''
   After sketching the NHTSA findings, it closes with the words:
``Audi has been vindicated. Case closed.''
   Bennett agreed that the suit pending in Cook County Circuit Court
``theoretically'' involves people around the country _ it covers
about 300,000 current and former U.S. owners of Audi 5000 sedans,
model years 1978-1986 _ but said the clearly were not about the
court case.
   ``This is the only city in America where there could have been
any thought we were talking about that case. ...and anybody who read
the ad would know that's not what we're taking about,'' Bennett
said. ``We were talking about the larger issue and not just the
Chicago issue.''
   In August 1988, a judge rejected Audi's offer to give the
plaintiffs credits of between $300 and $2,000 toward purchase of a
new vehicle. The judge noted plaintiffs only would benefit if they
bought another Audi.
   Audi decided to drop negotiations and go to trial. Bennett said
the company did not expect any action on the trial before late
summer or fall.
   Lisco said plaintiffs' attorneys have asked the judge to apply a
finding by a New Jersey appellate court, which affirmed a $100,000
judgment for punitive damages against Audi because of a design
defect allegedly linked to sudden acceleration.
   At issue was the location of the gas and the brake pedal, ``so
close to one another that a driver might inadvertently place their
foot on the accelerator thinking they're applying it to the brake,''
Lisco said.
   Bennett rejected characterization of the pedal placement as a
design defect.
   The NTHSA found that Audi recall campaigns to modify the pedals
on 1978 through 1983 models, install automatic shift-lock mechanisms
on all models and correct idle-speed controls in 1984 through 1986
models ``appear to have resulted in a very substantial reduction of
the number of sudden acceleration incidents and accidents.''
   Bennett said the shift lock ``reduced the complaint level by over
90 percent'' about the West German-made cars, distributed by
Volkswagen of America.

<HEAD>Marion, Dow Officials Say Merger Fit is Perfect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY STREFF BUZBEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Company officials said Tuesday a
multibillion-dollar agreement for Dow Chemical Co. to acquire a
majority stake in Marion Laboratories Inc. will give Dow the solid
position in pharmaceuticals it wants and give Marion the new
products it needs.
   Under the agreement signed late Monday, Dow Chemical plans to
merge its subsidiary, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. of
Cincinnati, with Marion. The new company, called Marion Merrell Dow
Inc., will be based in Kansas City.
   The deal will create a new global pharmaceutical company with
worldwide annual sales of about $2.3 billion, said Fred W. Lyons
Jr., president and chief executive officer of Marion, who will
become president of the new company.
   ``We've become a major player right now,'' Lyons said.
   Joseph G. Temple Jr., executive vice president of Dow and
chairman and chief executive officer of Merrell Dow, will become
chairman and CEO for two to three years before retiring.
   The new company will have 1,500 sales representatives in the
United States and a significant marketing presence in foreign
markets, Lyons said.
   Dow Merrell and Marion both are growing rapidly. But the slightly
larger Dow Merrell has concentrated on basic research, while Marion
specializes in licensing other companies' compounds, developing
medical uses for them and then marketing the new drugs. Dow has a
much bigger overseas presence.
   ``It's really a perfect fit,'' Lyons said.
   Both Dow Merrell and Marion had been searching for possible
business partners for several months, Lyons said, and began talking
two months ago.
   For Dow Merrell's corporate parent, the deal satisfies a desire
to diversify and expand its pharmaceutical interests to protect
itself from the cyclical swings in chemicals and plastics, analysts
said.
   ``Dow has been trying to get out of the commodity chemical
business into something that's more value-added,'' said Steven
Bernard, an analyst with Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. in St. Louis.
   Marion's sales exploded in the early 1980s thanks to the drug
Cardizem, but the company had no significant new products under
development to compensate for increasing competition in 1992, when
companies can begin producing generic varieties of Cardizem.
   ``We didn't think the glory days would come back unless they came
up with a new product,'' said Jon Braatz, an analyst with B.C.
Christopher Securities Co. in Kansas City.
   Besides Cardizem, which is used to treat angina and high blood
pressure, Marion's main product is the anti-ulcer drug Carafate.
   Merrell Dow's main products are the antihistamine Seldane, an
anti-cholesterol drug Lorelco, the anti-smoking gum Nicorette and
Cepacol, a mouthwash.
   In the first step of the two-stage deal, Dow will buy 39 percent
of Marion's 150 million outstanding shares at 38 each, or about $2.2
billion.
   Later, the big chemical company will acquire about 28 percent
more of Marion's stock, giving Dow a 67 percent interest in Marion
by 1991 or 1992.
   Dow plans to pay for the newly issued shares by turning Merrell
Dow over to Marion and issuing a new class of securities that
provide for payments by Dow to Marion shareholders based on Marion's
stock price at the time.
   Ewing Kauffman, who founded Marion in his Kansas City garage in
1950, and his family support the transaction. The family will tender
their shares to Dow, Lyons said. The Kauffmans now control 23
percent of Marion stock. They would be able to sell only the same
portion of their shares as other Marion shareholders, or 39 percent.

<HEAD>July Soybean Contract Finishes Ahead as First Liquidation Deadline
Passes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures closed mixed Tuesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, as the first of two deadlines requiring traders to reduce
large positions in the July contract passed without fanfare.
   On other markets, copper extended its rally on renewed fears of
terrorist action against mines in Peru and Papua New Guinea, but the
precious metals failed to shake recent doldrums despite a sharp
decline by the dollar.
   Petroleum futures were mixed and livestock and cattle futures
were lower.
   Just as it had Monday, weather again took over center stage in
the grain and soybean pits.
   Because corn is in its most critical growing stage, heavy rains
in the Corn Belt were viewed as favorable to crop production and
prices in that pit opened under pressure and held to the downside
all day.
   Wheat, however, was bolstered by forecasts for drier weather in
the Plains states and better-than-expected export business and
managed to stay on the upside through most of the session.
   Soybeans started the day lower in sympathy with the losses in
corn, but several large buys by commercial brokers helped hold the
line and enabled the July and August contracts to rebound.
   With soybean supplies expected to remain tight for the near term,
both months held their gains while contracts for the back months
closed lower.
   Traders said, overall, that there was less selling than might
have been expected Tuesday in light of a BOT emergency order last
week requiring traders to reduce their positions in the July
contract to 3 million bushels by the close of trading.
   The order, widely interpreted as the exchange's reaction to the
large soybean position built by Italian agribusiness giant Ferruzzi
S.p.A., calls for traders to be down to 1 million bushels when the
July contract goes off the board Thursday.
   Ferruzzi said it had accumulated contracts for delivery of as
much as 24 million bushels of soybeans to meet export business
commitments and ensure a steady flow of product for its processing
plants; others have suggested the company sought to corner the
soybean market.
   ``Supply tightness aside, there are two reasons the closing
prices were interesting,'' said a trader who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. ``The first is that the volume in July beans was very
thin because nobody wants to get involved. That might explain the
healthy price climb there.
   ``As for August,'' he added, ``Ferruzzi may simply have rolled
their July contracts into the next month.''
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 4 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.87{ a bushel; corn was 6\ cents lower to }
cents higher, with July at $2.48\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3{
cents higher, with September at $1.42 a bushel; and soybeans were 9\
cents lower to 18 cents higher, with July at $6.95{ a bushel.
   July and August traditionally are the months of slowest
industrial demand for copper, but the September contract picked up
.50 cent a pound Monday on reports of trouble in Peru, and rocketed
ahead 3.8 cents Tuesday.
   Fueling the price climb was news of a strike by workers at a
copper mine in British Columbia, Canada, and reports that the state
of emergency declared by the government of Papua New Guinea _ set to
end in mid-August, when operations at the Bougainville mine were to
resume _ will be extended through mid-September.
   Also helping move prices were reports that Shining Path guerillas
in Peru who have caused disruptions at the lead, zinc and silver
mining operations of Centromin, the state-owned company, would
include copper mines in future actions.
   ``The supply picture has been bullish for some time, but the
demand is not there for much of the summer,'' said Bette Raptopolous
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. ``The threat of
terrorist activity gave it a lot more immediacy.''
   Copper settled 2 cents to 3.8 cents higher on the Comex, with
July at 109.8 cents a pound.
   Precious metals didn't fare quite as well.
   Gold, also traded on the Comex, climbed $1.60 to $1.90, with July
at $372.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.1 cents lower,
with July at 524.2 cents a pound. Platinum, traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, settled $4.30 to $4.50 lower, with July at
$504.20 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures were mixed to mostly lower.
   Crude oil settled 11 cents to 32 cents lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with August at $20.34 a barrel; heating oil was
.26 lower to .07 cent higher, with August at 50.50 cents a gallon;
and unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to 1.02 cents lower, with August
at 56.06 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and cattle futures were mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .32 cent lower, with August at
72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower to .05 cent
higher, with August at 83.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent
to .60 cent lower, with July at 47.47 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .75 cent to 1.1 cents lower, with July at 28.27 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>GM Putting Air Bags as Standard Equipment in 13 1990 Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARREN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Driver-side air bags will be standard in 13
models of General Motors Corp.'s 1990 cars, costing the automaker at
least $500 per car, the company's president said Tuesday.
   Robert Stempel refused to disclose what the device would cost
consumers. but said the company has spent nearly $1 billion in
research, design, development and labor costs.
   The cost per car could drop if consumers want the air bags on
more models.
   The federal government requires all cars made in the United
States after Sept. 1 to have a passive restraint system for
front-seat riders. That could involve air bags or automatic seat
belts.
   An exemption in the law allows automakers who put air bags on the
driver's side to equip the passenger's side with a manual
lap-and-shoulder belt system until Sept. 1, 1993.
   All of Chrysler Corp.'s U.S.-made cars for the 1990 model year,
which makes up 90 percent of its automobile fleet, will have
driver-side air bags and manual lap-shoulder belts as standard
equipment.
   Chrysler spokesman Ben Dunn declined to say what the system would
cost. Prices for 1990 cars have not been released.
   Ford Motor Co. has said about 1 million of its 1990 model cars,
or about half of its car fleet, will have driver-side air bags. They
will be standard equipment in the Ford Mustang, Taurus and Crown
Victoria; the Mercury Sable, Grand Marquis; the Lincoln Town Car,
Continental and Mark VII and the Merkur Scorpio.
   They will be offered as options on the Ford Tempo and the Mercury
Topaz.
   Spokeswoman Joy Stinson declined to say what air bags would cost
and said they are not included as a separate option, but as part of
a package of extra features.
   Auto industry observers expect higher prices for 1990 cars,
partly because of the passive-restraint law.
   ``It's an expensive system,'' Stempel said. He estimated that a
consumer could pay about $1,000 to replace an air-bag system used in
an accident.
   GM's system inflates when the car is involved in a front-end
wreck as strong as slamming into a barrier at 14 mph or more. The
bag, carried in the center of the steering wheel, inflates in 1-30th
of a second or three times faster than the blink of an eye. It
deflates slowly.
   Driver-side air bags will be optional in the Oldsmobile 88 Royale
and 98 Regency. In the past, the air-bag option in those cars has
cost $850.
   The company said about 500,000 1990 cars, or less than 15 percent
of GM's car fleet, would have the systems as standard equipment.
Included are:
   _Buick Reatta and Riviera.
   _Cadillac Allante, DeVille, Eldorado, Fleetwood and Seville.
   _Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette.
   _Geo Metro Convertible, later in the model year, and Storm.
   _Oldsmobile Toronado.
   _Pontiac Firebird.
   All other GM cars will have automatic seat belts for front-seat
passengers.

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Bill To Hinder Hostile Corporate Takeovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, moving to
protect Massachusetts companies and workers against corporate
raiders, signed legislation Tuesday to hinder debt-financed
takeovers.
   The law received support from a number of business and labor
groups in Massachusetts but has been attacked by some investors and
securities specialists as an effort to entrench corporate managers.
   Modeled after a Delaware statute, the law will freeze a target
company's assets for three years unless the buyer either is approved
by the company's board or obtains 90 percent of the stock not
controlled by management.
   Dukakis signed the bill at the Cambridge headquarters of Polaroid
Corp., the instant camera and film company, which earlier this year
used the Delaware law to fend off a hostile bid from a group led by
Roy Disney, heir to the Disney entertainment fortune. Polaroid is
incorporated in Delaware.
   State officials said the law was prompted by recent takeover
battles for Polaroid and other Massachusetts companies _ including
Gillette, Prime Computer and Dunkin' Donuts _ that the Dukakis
administration views as a threat to the state's economic vitality.
   More than 20 states have anti-takeover statutes, but the
Massachusetts law is among the most comprehensive, containing
provisions to protect labor as well as management, said Stanley
Keller, a corporate lawyer with the Boston firm of Palmer &amp; Dodge.
   While businesses may object to some provisions, such as a
requirement of severance pay for workers laid off during and after
takeovers, ``the corporate community has been willing to buy into
the legislation because it is well balanced,'' Keller said.
   The law also requires buyers to assume the collective bargaining
agreements of their target companies; clarifies the authority of
corporate boards to set up anti-takeover defenses; and raises the
number of shares needed to call a special stockholder meeting to 40
percent, from 10 percent.
   The law generally takes effect once a potential buyer obtains 5
percent of the target company's stock, one of the lowest thresholds
in the nation. In contrast, Delaware's statute kicks in at 15
percent and New York's at 10 percent.
   At the urging of mutual fund companies, however, the legislation
allows institutional investors to acquire up to 15 percent of a
company without triggering the anti-takeover restrictions.
   Bernard Black, a professor of securities law at Columbia
University in New York, called the measure ``basically a management
protection statute'' that could have ``perverse effects.''
   Dukakis and state Secretary of Economic Affairs Gray Hedgespeth
said the asset-freeze provision was designed to stop hostile raiders
from borrowing heavily to acquire a company, then selling off its
parts to help pay the takeover debt.
   Black contended the asset freeze would deter beneficial economic
activity.
   ``What you hope for in a business combination is some sort of
efficiency, combining the target's operations with your own and
slimming down because of economies of scale or scope,'' he said.
``The Massachusetts statute and others like it...have the potential
for preventing whatever efficiency gains may come from hostile
takeovers.''

<TEXT>
   United Airlines, seeking a niche in the already
crowded U.S.-European air travel market, announced Tuesday it hopes
to begin serving the continent next spring from four American cities.
   The nation's second-largest air carier said it has filed
petitions for its proposed European routes with the U.S. Department
of Transportation.
   United Chairman and President Stephen M. Wolf said that in the
first phase of its plan, United would begin flying next spring
between its Chicago and Washington, D.C., hubs to Frankfurt and
Paris, as well as between Chicago and Milan with continuing service
to Rome.
   Last month, United said it also was seeking to begin service
between Chicago and Warsaw, with continuing service to Budapest.
   In the second phase, the airline has asked for authority to link
Paris with both San Francisco and New York. United currently holds
authority to fly between those cities and Frankfurt, but does not
fly the routes.
   ``Combined with our extensive Pacific routes and our
comprehensive domestic network, this action means that United will
be a truly global airline in the 1990s,'' Wolf said.
   In addition, United has requested government approval to fly
between London and San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New
York. It also seeks permission to fly between Glasgow, Scotland, and
both Chicago and Washington.
   ``Within a year, we expect to have a presence in several of the
major transportation centers of Europe, and we will build
aggressively upon that base,'' he said.
   Analysts say United's announcement that it plans to serve Europe
from its U.S. hubs is not a surprise.
   ``Basically when they ordered a number of Boeing 767s, their
intent was very clear,'' said Helane Becker, a vice president of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Earlier this year, United announced orders for as many as 370
Boeing aircraft valued at $15.74 billion. The package includes firm
orders for 180 Boeing jetliners and options on 190 others.
   ``United's movement into the major markets of Europe, like our
recent record-breaking aircraft order, shows that we are committed
to serving the transportation needs not only of America, but also of
a growing portion of the international market,'' Wolf said.
   Seven U.S. airlines fly between the United States and Europe _
USAir, Continental, Delta, Pan American, TWA, Northwest and
American, the nation's largest carrier.
   ``It is not surprising they (United) want to serve Europe out of
major U.S. cities, that is everybody's goal,'' Ms. Becker said,
adding that the U.S.-Europe air routes are very well served.
   ``But relative to being a long-term viable competitor, you have
to look at all sorts of service.''
   The decision to expand service into Europe is the latest
indication that United has climbed out of the doldrums it wallowed
in earlier in the decade.
   In addition to acquiring aircraft, in the past year the airline
has snatched executive talent from other airlines, come out with
agressive marketing programs and has become more competitive at its
hubs.
   With United's renewed vigor has come rumors of a takeover attempt
that have sent the price of parent UAL Corp. stock soaring on the
New York Stock Exchange. Traders began focusing on United as a
takeover target after last month's acceptance by NWA Inc. _
Northwest's parent company _ of a $3.65 billion buyout by Los
Angeles investor Alfred Checchi.
   Analysts say a bid for United would substantially top that figure.

<HEAD>Weyerhaeuser Posts Profit Gain, Scott Posts Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Second-quarter profits for Weyerhaeuser Co. increased 3 percent,
while Scott Paper Co.'s earnings slipped 5 percent, the forest
products companies said Tuesday.
   Tacoma, Wash.-based Weyerhaeuser said it earned $154.8 million,
or 73 cents per share, in the second quarter compared with $150.6
million, or 72 cents per share for the same period last year.
   Net sales for the quarter totaled $2.64 billion, up 8 percent
from the $2.4 billion for second-quarter 1988.
   For the first half of the year, Weyeerhaesuser unet income was
$303 million or $1.43 a share, up 14 percent from the $265.4 million
or $1.26 a share in the same period last year. Net sales rose to
$4.97 billion, from $4.59 billion.
   Income figures for 1988 were restated to conform with a new
accounting standard affecting the company's GNA financial services
subsidiary, Weyerhaeuser reported. The change added one cent to 1988
per-share figures.
   Pulp and paper markets and pricing continue generally strong,
said Weyerhaeuser chairman and chief executive officer George H.
Weyerhaeuser.
   Some discounting is occurring in newsprint and other papers while
containerboard packaging markets are relatively stable, he said.
   The company's newsprint business has been hurt by lower prices in
Western U.S. markets as well as lower export prices and material and
energy cost increases, the company said.
   In forest products, domestic and overseas demand for Western
products has remained at a high level, the company said. But it
added that there is a weak market and soft pricing in Eastern and
Southeastern states.
   In another development, Weyerhaeuser announced Monday that it wil
sell its Specialty Plants Division, another move in its plan to
concentrate on the forest products business.
   The 53-person division, based in the Tacoma suburb of Fife, does
about $3.5 million in sales each year. It markets preserved palms
and floral materials.
   Philadelphia-based Scott earned $71.5 million, or 93 cents per
share, in the second three months of 1989, down from $75.3 million,
or 98 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose nearly 8 percent to $1.25 billion from $1.16 billion a
year earlier.
   Philip E. Lippincott, Scott chairman and chief executive, blamed
the second-quarter slump on price controls and tough competition in
Mexico, higher pulp costs, manufacturing problems in the company's
S.D. Warren printing and publishing papers business and slower than
expected growth in the food service business.
   For the first six months of the year, Scott's earnings increased
nearly 6 percent to $158 million, or $2.05 per share, on sales of
$2.52 billion. The company earned $149.3 million, or $1.95 a share,
on sales of $2.29 billion a year earlier.

   Eli Lilly and Co. said Tuesday its
second-quarter profit rose 20 percent on a revenue increase of 11
percent, citing increases in its medical instrument and
pharmaceutical businesses.
   Lilly earned $217.1 million, or 75 cents a share, in the second
quarter compared with $180.7 million, or 63 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales for the quarter rose to $1.12 billion from $1.01 billion a
year earlier.
   The company said sales of its new antidepressant Prozac were
particularly strong. Its medical instrument systems division's sales
growth was led by Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. and Advances
Cardiovascular Systems Inc.
   For the first half, net income rose 21 percent to $501.8 million,
or $1.74 a share, from $413.9 million, or $1.45 a share, a year

   First-half sales rose 12 percent to $2.35 billion from $2.09

   Imported foods that don't meet U.S. standards
regularly find their way to American dinner tables because
government inspectors lack the resources to enforce federal
regulations, a congressional staff report said Tuesday.
   Importers often exploit the weaknesses in the Food and Drug
Administration's inspection system and the lack of coordination
between FDA and the Customs Service to get substandard products onto
the U.S. market, said the staff report of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
   Moreover, the report said, the chance that violators will be
caught is slim and, even when they are caught, the penalties are so
slight that violators view them as nothing more than a ``minor cost
of doing business.''
   In 1987, the FDA tested 2 percent of more than 1 million
shipments of imported food, the investigators wrote. Some 40 percent
of the tested samples did not meet FDA standards for reasons
including contamination with salmonella, pesticides, insects and
filth.
   ``One cannot but wonder how many contaminated importations are
overlooked,'' the report said.
   The subcommittee begins a series of hearings Wednesday into the
government's food-import regulations.
   The FDA, in responding to the report, said it exaggerated some of
the problems, ``but the report is nevertheless correct in showing
that increased imports have strained the federal government's system
for sampling, testing and blocking some questionable imports. FDA,
however, has worked with the U.S. Customs Service to coordinate our
priorities and protect the public health.''
   The report details the ease with which shipments that are tested
and rejected by the FDA can still end up being sold to U.S.
consumers.
   The FDA's Import Operations Branch, in a March 1988 study cited
by the congressional report, estimated that more than 12 percent of
all refused shipments got onto the U.S. market anyway.
   For instance, importers sometimes give Customs officials fake
documentation purporting to show that rejected goods were destroyed
when, in fact, they were sold to U.S. distributors illegally.
   Another way importers evade the system is to ``port shop.'' When
a shipment is rejected, the importer can take his goods to another
port of entry and try again.
   An example cited in the report occurred in Puerto Rico, where the
FDA district office instituted an intensive examination of all
shellfish over a six-week period. Inspectors found that 75 percent
of the shipments did not meet federal standards, mostly from
decomposition. Shellfish imports dropped dramatically.
   ``San Juan believed its efforts to improve shellfish quality had
succeeded, but subsequently found decomposed shellfish in the food
distribution system,'' the report said. ``San Juan concluded that
the shellfish they refused to admit were entered at a mainland port
and shipped back to Puerto Rico.''

   Citicorp, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Continental Bank Corp. reported
higher second-quarter earnings Tuesday while Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. and Bank of New England Corp. said their profits tumbled
during the period.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest banking concern, based in New
York, said its net income for the three months ended June 30 rose 10
percent to $395 million, or $1.11 a share, from $359 million, or
$1.03 a share, in the comparable 1988 period.
   Manufacturers Hanover reported its profits fell 74 percent to
$106 million, or $1.87 a share, from $403 million, or $7.93 a share,
in second quarter 1988. The 1988 quarter included some $336 million
in one-time gains from asset sales and tax benefits.
   Wells Fargo's net income rose 18 percent to $147.4 million, or
$2.68 a share, in the second quarter from $124.4 million, or $2.24 a
share, in the year-earlier period.
   Bank of New England's net income dropped 47 percent to $36.5
million, or 52 cents a share, from $69.2 million, or $1 a share, in
the year-earlier period. The company said the profit decline
reflected significant losses on real estate stemming from the
slowdown of the regional economy.
   Continental reported its earnings for the second quarter
increased 6 percent to $64 million, or $1.01 per share, on revenues
of $286 million, up from profit of $60 million, or 95 cents a share,
on revenues of $258 million for the same period a year ago.
   Citicorp said its net interest revenue rose 8 percent to $1.84
billion, while other revenue rose 5 percent to $1.5 billion and
non-interest expenses rose 6 percent to $2.6 billion.
   The company took a $329 million provision for possible credit
losses and wrote off $534 million in credit, including $223 million
to debtor nations. Citicorp announced earlier in the year that it
was writing down $185 million of medium and long-term debt related
to its Argentine loans.
   For the first half of 1989, Citicorp's net income totaled $924
million, or $2.63 a share, up 29 percent from $717 million, or $2.04
a share, a year earlier.
   Citicorp said first-half results included a gain of $77 million
in the first quarter from the sale of property in Japan and $154
million in interest payments from Brazil, which were due but unpaid
in the first half of 1988. The Brazil payment was offset by $49
million of unpaid interest due from Argentina.
   Citicorp's total reserve for loan losses was $3.9 billion as of
June 30, down from $4.5 billion a year earlier.
   Manufacturers Hanover said its second quarter results reflected
strength in regional banking and global wholesale activities.
Results for the year-earlier quarter included a $291 million gain
from the sale of Manufacturers Hanover Consumer Services Inc.
   Net interest income was up nearly 1 percent to $453 million,
while non-interest revenue fell 47.2 percent to $353 million and
non-interest expense was nearly flat at $530 million.
   Net interest revenue was reduced by $38 million in the quarter
and by $70 million in the first six months due to $894 million in
nonperforming loans from Argentina.
   The company took a provision for possible credit losses of $100
million in the second quarter, down from $133 million in the same
period last year.
   Net charge-offs of loans to developing countries in the second
quarter totaled $291 million, up from $56 million in the 1988
quarter. It included $247 million in net charge-offs of medium- and
long-term loans to Argentina.
   As of June 30, Manufacturers Hanover's total loan-loss reserve
was $2.06 billion, down from $2.53 billion a year earlier.
   For the first six months of the year, the company had net income
of $209 million, or $3.70 a share, down 62 percent from $544
million, or $10.52 a share, in the first half of 1988.
   Bank of New England, based in Boston, reported net interest
income of $252.3 million, down 8 percent from last year. It took a
$69.7 million provision for possible loan losses during the quarter
and had a loan loss reserve of $341.7 million as of June 30.
   Nonperforming assets rose to $667.4 million as of June 30 from
$550.8 million three months earlier.
   The company reported net income of $78.8 million, or $1.12 a
share in the first half of 1989, down 42 percent from $135.4
million, or $1.96 a share, in the first half of 1988.
   Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, said its second-quarter
benefited from increased net interest income, which primarily
resulted from an increase in domestic loans.
   Net interest income was $531.5 million compared with $482.1
million a year ago.
   Net income in the first half was $288.9 million, or $5.24 a
share, up 18 percent from $244.8, or $4.39 a share, in last year's
first half.
   Wells Fargo took a $100 million provision for loan losses in the
second quarter and net loan charge-offs were $42.7 million.
Nonperforming loans totaled $1.2 billion as of June 30, down from
$1.4 billion a year earlier.
   Chicago-based Continental said that for the first six months of
1989, net income was $140 million, or $2.25 a share, up 9 percent
from $129 million, or $2.05 a share, a year ago.
   ``Our core businesses accounted for a $26 million, or 10 percent,
increase in second-quarter revenues, once again demonstrating good
progress in pursuing our all-business strategy,'' said Continental
Chairman Thomas C. Theobald, referring to the bank's emphasis on
business accounts instead of consumer accounts.

<HEAD>Republic Pilots Vote to Support Checchi Bid For NWA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAM SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Republic Airlines pilots now flying for
Northwest Airline gave their blessing Tuesday to a takeover bid by
Los Angeles businessman Al Checchi, calling it the ``best available
option'' for the carrier's well-being.
   The resolution, passed unanimously by the Republic Master
Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association, also urged
other employee groups and unions of Northwest's parent, NWA Inc., to
back the $4 billion offer by Checchi's acquisition group, Wings
Holdings Inc.
   NWA's board of directors approved the takeover last month.
   Union spokesman Curt Kruse said the endorsement by former
Republic pilots of Checchi's buyout offer doesn't mean pilots are
pleased with the pace of negotiations for a new contract between
ALPA and Northwest.
   He also said the pilots still have concerns over the $3.35
billion in debt that NWA would incur in the buyout.
   ``However, once we had an opportunity to review his (Checchi's)
financial plan, our concerns diminished somewhat,'' he said.
   NWA pilots have said they are running out of patience with the
slack pace of contract negotiations. They've also said a strike
would be disastrous for Checchi, who would pay shareholders of the
Eagan-based airline $121 a share.
   Checchi has said he prefers to have the pilots signed to a
contract before his group takes ownership. But some in the union
want to wait for his arrival to complete the negotiations.
   Northwest's largest union, the 20,000-member Machinists union
District Lodge 143, supports the Checchi bid.

<HEAD>Aeroflot Applies To Join IATA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, has applied
to join the International Air Transport Association, IATA spokesman
John Brindley said Tuesday.
   He said the association welcomed the decision by Aeroflot to
``become part of the civil aviation mainstream.''
   An IATA official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said one reason for Aeroflot's application was concern that the
airline might be barred from some airports by new regulations on
noise control.
   The official said government civil aviation authorities are
expected to discuss reductions in noise levels at a meeting in
September and Aeroflot's aircraft do ``not meet all the standards.''
   Brindley said membership in IATA, an organization of 187
airlines, would give Aeroflot access to technical information on
issues such as noise control.
   Aeroflot operates more than 3,000 aircraft flying to cities
within the Soviet Union and to 125 destinations worldwide, according
to IATA figures.
   In 1988 the airline transported 126 million passengers, making it
the world's largest carrier. But only 4 million were on
international flights, compared to the 16.9 million people
transported worldwide by British Airways, the biggest international
carrier, Brindley said.
   Boris Paniukov, first vice minister of Soviet Civil Aviation, and
Boris Ryzhenkov, executive secretary of the Soviet Commission on
International Civil Aviation, presented the formal membership
application at a meeting Tuesday at IATA's European headquarters in
Geneva, Brindley said.
   He said representatives at the meeting discussed ways of
integrating the Soviet airline into the association as quickly as
possible.

<HEAD>Jury Imposes $243.5 Million Damage Award Against B&amp;LE Railroad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal court jury ordered the Bessemer &amp;
Lake Erie railroad on Tuesday to pay $243.5 million in damages in an
antitrust case brought by steelmakers, truck lines and a dock
company.
   But the railroad, which plans to appeal the verdict, said in a
statement that several important motions remained before the court
that could significantly reduce or eliminate the award.
   B&amp;LE also said it expected the damage verdict to be offset by
payments from settlements by other defendant railroads.
   Litigation is expected to continue in the case for years.
   ``The B&amp;LE ... intends to pursue all of its appellate rights in
seeking to correct what it believes to be totally inappropriate
findings,'' spokesman Robert N. Gentile said.
   Ten suits were filed against the B&amp;LE and other railroads in 1983
and 1984, contending they conspired to block the development of
self-unloading ore boats, forcing steel companies to rely on the
railroads to receive ore shipments.
   Three railroad companies _ CSX Corp., Consolidated Rail Corp. and
Norfolk Southern Corp. _ settled out of court during the trial. The
B&amp;LE was the only defendant to proceed to a verdict in the case.
   Among the plaintiffs were Sharon Steel Corp., National Steel
Corp., Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., LTV Corp., Tauro Trucking
Co., Ambrosia Trucking and Erie Dock Co.
   The judgment returned Tuesday was in a consolidation of the suits.
   The case was heard by two juries. The first one found the B&amp;LE
guilty on June 19 of violating antitrust laws. The second jury,
charged with determining damages, returned its decision Tuesday
after four days of deliberations.
   The B&amp;LE formerly was a wholly owned subsidiary of USX Corp. USX
spun off the railroad last December to Transtar Inc., which is owned
by Blackstone Capital Partners LP, USX and former managers of the
B&amp;LE. Blackstone holds 51 percent of Transtar.

   On the same day it announced second
quarter earnings of $63.4 million, Primerica Corp. said Tuesday it
had decided to keep its Fingerhut subsidiary after failing to find a
qualified buyer.
   Greenwich-based Primerica announced last year at the time of its
$1.65 billion merger with Commercial Credit Group Inc. that it
intended to sell Fingerhut Companies Inc., a direct mail marketing
business.
   But Sanford I. Weill, Primerica's chairman and chief executive
officer, said Tuesday, ``No appropriate buyer, both in terms of
financial consideration to Primerica and business compatibility with
Fingerhut, has presented itself.''
   He said Primerica, primarily a financial-services company, would
keep Fingerhut and attempt to build up the business.
   Primerica's second-quarter earnings translated into 65 cents a
share. In 1988's second quarter it earned $31.9 million, or $1.37 a
share. The figures aren't directly comparable since the merger
hadn't taken place in the first half of 1988.
   For the six months that ended June 30, Primerica earned $114
million, or $1.18 a share, compared with $61.2 million, or $1.37 a
share, in the first half of 1988.
   Revenues totaled $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 1989 and
$2.6 billion for the first six months. In 1988, revenues were $238
million in the second quarter and $467 million in the first half.

   General Dynamics Corp. reported Tuesday its
second-quarter earnings improved despite an an after-tax charge of
$50 million, or $1.20 per share, associated with the SSN 688-class
attack submarine at the company's Electric Boat Division.
   The defense contractor reported earnings of $58.4 million, or
$1.39 per share, on sales of $2.5 billion during the second quarter.
For the second quarter of 1988, the company earned $46.7 million, or
$1.11 per share, on sales of $2.4 billion.
   The results for the second quarter of 1988 reflected an after-tax
charge of $33 million, or 79 cents per share, associated with the
same attack submarine program.
   For the first half of 1989, General Dynamics earned $133.8
million, or $3.20 per share, on sales of $4.9 billion compared a
profit of $132.4 million, or $3.15 per share, on sales of $4.9
billion for the same period in 1988.
   The company's backlog was reported to have reached a record high,
including a funded backlog of $17.9 billion and total backlog of
$28.8 billion representing approximately three years in sales. At
the same time in 1988, the backlogs were listed at $16.7 billion
funded and $23.8 billion total
   ``We have been advising since 1987 that the outlook for the SSN
688-class attack submarine program at Electric Boat has been
uncertain,'' said Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Pace said General Dynamics has stopped recognizing Electric Boat
earnings and that additional charges will be recognized in the
future. Continuing shortages of qualified New England-area workers
and productivity that has been lower than anticipated resulted in
the rescheduling of work and the extension of Electric Boat delivery
rates, Pace said.
   Cited by Pace for improved performance during the second quarter
were the land systems and general aviation segments of the company.
   The company achieved higher profitability rate on its M1 tank
program through advanced manufacturing techniques and cost
containments, Pace said, and the Cessna Aircraft unit achieved a
substantial increase in its Citation business jets sales.

<TEXT>
   Police said they have rearrested the president of a
machinery company for allegedly selling restricted semiconductor
manufacturing equipment to East Germany.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity Monday,
said Hirokuni Matsuda, president of Prometron Technics Corp.,
exported the equipment, valued at the equivalent of $98,600, via
South Korea and China in 1987 without governmental approval.
   The equipment, a mask aligner produced by Canon Inc. of Japan, is
used in etching integrated circuits onto silicon plates. It is on a
list of items restricted by the Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Control, or COCOM, a Paris-based organization
that regulates Western trade in strategic items with the communist
bloc.
   On July 7, police arrested Matsuda for allegedly supplying East
Germany in 1986 and 1987 with more than 22 pounds of hafnium, a rare
material that can be used in nuclear reactor rods. Hafnium also is
on the COCOM list.
   While questioning Matsuda about the first violation,
investigators discovered the semiconductor case, the official said.
   He said Prometron, a Tokyo-based maker of air plasma steel
cutters, set up a subsidiary in South Korea allegedly to purchase
the equipment from Canon on June 27, 1987. The subsidiary allegedly
shipped it to East Germany via Shanghai, China, the official said.
   He said police rearrested Matsuda on charges of violating Japan's
Trade Control Law, Customs Laws and Foreign Exchange Laws. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Stock Exchange Confirms Merger Talks With AMEX, Two
Others</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `The rule ...,' to CORRECT year to 1990 stead
1989.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Stock Exchange and two other
major U.S. exchanges separately are discussing merging with the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the country's oldest securities market,
the Philadelphia exchange president said Tuesday.
   The talks come amid concerns by members of the Philadelphia
exchange that a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule dealing
with equity options will put the Philadelphia market at a
competitive disadvantage, Nicholas Giordano said Tuesday.
   The rule, which will be phased in beginning Jan. 21, 1990, will
prohibit exchanges from holding exclusive rights to deal in
particular options.
   The Philadelphia exchange now handles about 13 percent of the
nation's options trading. An option is a right to buy or sell a
block of stock at a certain price within a stipulated time.
   The Philadelphia exchange has been approached numerous times
about mergers in the past, Giordano said. The talks with the
American Exchange and the two other, unidentified exchanges grew
serious after the SEC rule change, he said.
   ``While our discussions with all three markets have been
substantive, the difficulties and complexities of affecting such a
merger are great and we must be realistic about the likelihood of
successful merger discussions,'' Giordano said.
   ``We are proceeding on the assumption that the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange will be independent for at least another 200 years,'' he
said of the market founded in 1790.
   Giordano said determining whether a merger can be arranged would
take months.
   ``They are attracted primarily to our currency options and stock
options marketplace, but they are also attracted to our equity
floor,'' Giordano said.
   The Philadelphia exchange Tuesday also announced a 29 percent
increase in stock trading volume and a 24 percent increase in equity
options traded in the first six months of the year, compared with
the same period last year.
   The Philadelphia exchange and the American Exchange have been
bickering for months over Philadelphia's claim that the Amex copied
its idea for a new security, Cash Index Participations. The CIP,
which is tied to the Standard and Poors Index of 500 stocks, allows
investors to speculate on the trend of the stock market.
   Shortly after the Philadelphia exchange submitted its proposal to
the SEC, the American Exchange submitted a similar proposal. Since
the SEC approved trading of the participations earlier this year,
Philadelphia exchange officials have made sharply worded public
statements about the similarities of the Amex's Equity Index
Participations.
   On Tuesday, Giordano said the argument consisted of ``normal
business differences'' by Giordano.

<HEAD>TWR Reports Slight Drop in Second-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TRW Inc. reported Tuesday that its
second-quarter profit dropped 2 percent on flat sales.
   The high-technology company said its net income decreased to $70
million, or $1.12 a share on a fully diluted basis, from $71
million, or $1.15 a share, in the second quarter of 1988. Sales for
the quarter totaled $1.84 billion, compared with $1.82 billion for
the same period last year.
   However, the company said, the second-quarter operating profit of
its continuing businesses rose by 2 percent. TRW said the decline in
net earnings was caused by higher interest expenses resulting from
the company's Chilton Corp. and Talley air bag acquisitions.
   TRW provides technological products and services mainly for the
space, defense and automotive industries and for information systems
markets.
   For the first half, TRW earned $139 million, or $2.24 a share, on
revenue of $3.63 billion, compared with a profit of $137 million, or
2.22 a share, on revenue of $3.62 billion in the same period of
1988, the company reported.
   ``We continue to make sound progress in all our businesses,''
said Chairman Joseph T. Gorman.
   ``The information systems business has improved its performance
significantly, the space and defense segment again reported higher
earnings despite lower sales in a difficult market, and the occupant
restraints business continues its impressive growth,'' he said.
