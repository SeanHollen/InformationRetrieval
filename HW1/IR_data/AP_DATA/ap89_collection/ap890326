   Inmates took over a prison farm Sunday and
seized guards and visitors as hostages, news broadcasts said, with
as many as five people killed and up to 20 injured.
   Television station Notisiete said Easter was a visiting day and
about 250 prisoners were holding an estimated 400 people hostage,
including guards, other inmates and visiting families with children.
   Notisiete broadcast reports, which were not confirmed by
officials, said three guards and two inmates were killed. A private
radio station, National Broadcasters Information Patrol Service,
reported that at least two guards and two inmates were killed and
20 people were injured.
   Neither report gave any indication of the cause of the uprising
at the Pavon prison farm 12 miles east of Guatemala City.
   The takeover began early Sunday afternoon and continued into the
night, local television and radio stations reported.
   Witnesses said firefighters and Red Cross workers were seen
entering the prison with five stretchers.
   Prison officials and the national police refused to comment on
the situation.
   Television newscasts showed the prison farm surrounded by police
and soldiers sent from the capital. An air force helicopter hovered
overhead.
   Notisiete said additional army units were on standby.
   The National Broadcasters Information Patrol Service broadcast
an interview with a man identified as Marcos Antonio Morales who
said he and his wife Maria were waiting outside to visit a family
member when the revolt began.
   Morales told the radio station his wife was among about 20
people who were wounded in a gunfight between inmates and guards.
He said his wife was taken to a police hospital and he did not know
the extent of her injuries.
   He said he took his wounded wife into a nearby prison chapel
where many other visitors sought refuge and where other injured
were being cared for.
   Reports said officials tried to bargain with prisoners to get
them to surrender rifles they grabbed from prison guards, and then
most of the weapons were recovered after a gun battle. The reports
said negotiations were continuing.
   Notisiete quoted Fire Department Cmdr. Alejandro Giammattei
Falla as saying the inmates demanded to talk with federal human
rights director Gonzalo Mendez de la Riva and that journalists and
medical workers be allowed to enter the prison.

   The sweeping esplanade and
the giant granite cross thrusting up from the surrounding mountains
dwarf the schoolgirls and conscripts on an outing at the Valley of
the Fallen.
   The visitors giggle, shout and strut. They appear oblivious to
the presence in the crypt behind them of the bones of 40,000 people
who died fighting on both sides in the Spanish Civil War, which
ended 50 years ago on April 1, 1939.
   Neither the monument _ built by Republican prisoners-of-war
defeated by the forces of Gen. Francisco Franco _ nor the memory of
the three-year war itself seem to weigh very heaviliy on the spirit
of a modern Spain.
   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has
planned no public observance for April 1, the day a half-century
ago that ushered in a 36-year Franco dictatorship that outlawed the
Socialist and all other political parties.
   Socialists, Communists, liberals, anarchists, Masons and
free-thinkers all suffered in the harsh repression that followed
Franco's victory, which marked the end of his July 1936 uprising
against the forces of the Second Spanish Republic.
   Many who fought on the side of the Republic perished from hunger
and ill treatment while hacking away at the granite mountains to
build the Valley of the Fallen, 30 miles northwest of Madrid.
   ``The Socialists try to distinguish themselves from the
Francoists by not keeping alive the memory of the Civil War,''
British historian Paul Preston explained. ``There's nothing good to
remember. It wasn't really the end, it was the beginning of very
difficult times for many, many people.''
   A member of the Friends of Former Spanish Refugees said the
government had agreed to help with their project to have as many
indigent, elderly exiles as possible return to visit Spain this
year _ as long as no mention was made of the end of the Civil War
that drove them away in the first place.
   Jordi Corral Morales, a 21-year-old corporal in the army's elite
Brunete armored division, knows that Franco lies buried beneath a
plain, marble slab in the basilica, but he says he could care less
about the man whose crusade for a righteous, rightist Spain was
falling apart by the time the young conscript was born.
   The Valley of the Fallen _ which Franco designed as his final
resting place _ has been administered since 1982 by the National
Patrimony in hopes, according to some, that it will gradually lose
its fascist connotations and slip into the vast collection of old
castles and monuments that dot the Spanish landscape.
   Historian Javier Tusell and Culture Minister Jorge Semprun are
both concerned about Spaniards' reluctance to confront their past
and their lack of historical memory.
   On the eve of the 50th anniversary and 14 years after Franco's
death, ``it is striking that our country, which has gone through a
peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy, has not,
however, developed a shared historic conscience,'' Tusell wrote
recently in a Madrid newspaper.
   ``It's not a banal issue,'' he continued, ``because the image
that a group projects of itself on the past indicates its
willingness to live in harmony in the present and the future.''
   Pedro Alvarez remembers the day 50 years ago when he and a group
of other 12-year-olds joined the crowds in downtown Madrid that
hurried to put out the appropriate flags as the remaining
Republican troops fled and Franco's victorious Nationalist forces
approached the Spanish capital.
   ``We rushed into a barracks the `Reds' had abandoned and stuffed
our pockets with potatoes and carrots,'' he recalled. ``Hunger was
everywhere in Madrid during the war, and we were happy it was
over.''
   ``The war didn't really end in 1939, the hardships and
conditions of war continued well into the late 1940s,'' said
sociologist Amando de Miguel. ``People didn't marry very much, a
great sense of depression set in, there was a terrible shortage of
food, and then, the guerrilla warfare against Franco went on into
the 1950s.''
   Semprun, who wrote the screenplay for Alain Renais' 1964 film,
``La guerre est finie'' (The War is Over) as a Spanish exile in
France, warned attendants at recent academic conference that Spain
will be in trouble without a historical memory.
   To fill the gap, many of the country's leading newspapers plan
special supplements dealing with the end of the war and its
relevance today.
   And a surprising success of the current literary season has been
a novel entitled ``Luna de Lobos'' (Wolves' Moon), by 31-year-old
poet Julio Llanzamares, the sparse tale of three men in the
anti-Franco guerrilla movement who try to get to France through the
mountains of northern Spain.
   The late Spanish historian Claudio Sanchez Albornoz, who
exhorted his countrymen not to forget the Civil War, wrote that
during the 1931-39 Second Republic, Spaniards tried to carry out
religious, political and economic revolutions that their European
neighbors had taken centuries to realize.
   French historian Pierre Vilar says it will be possible to date
the real end of the Spanish Civil War to the time when the three
revolutions have been carried out.

   A 7-year-old boy who fell through ice and was
submerged in 40-degree water for nearly 20 minutes was in critical
condition, and authorities said his prognosis was good.
   Dwayne Peterson of Millcreek Township was in the intensive care
unit at Saint Vincent Health Center Sunday night.
   The boy was fishing on Presque Isle Bay with his father Saturday
morning when he fell into the bay and through the ice. Witnesses
said another young boy tried to pull him out but stopped when he
nearly fell in.
   The boy's father also tried, but could not find the youngster.
   Dwayne was eventually pulled from the bay by John Wronek of the
Erie County Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue SCUBA Team, who
said the water was about 18 feet deep and very dark.
   The child had no heartbeat.
   Wronek said the cold water may help the boy's fight for survival
because it tends to slow down body functions and defer the effects
of being underwater for a period of time, Wronek said.

   Said Al-Mufti, a former Jordanian prime
minister who helped his country become an independent kingdom, died
Saturday, state-run Jordan Television reported.
   The report did not give the cause of death or the age of one of
Jordan's leading citizens throughout the country's 68-year history
as an emirate under British protection and later as an independent
monarchy.
   He served repeatedly in Jordanian cabinets from 1929 until the
early 1960s, often as deputy prime minister and as interior
minister. As prime minister from April to December 1950, Mufti
opposed King Abdullah's negotiations with Israel. He was a major
figure in the regency council that governed Jordan between the
abdication of King Talal in 1952 and the 1953 accession of King
Hussein, then a teen-ager. He served a second term as prime
minister in 1956.

   Laotians voted to elect their ruling
national council for the first time Sunday in polling that some
foreign analysts described as a public relations exercise by
Communist leaders.
   A senior Laotian official said no major changes will be made in
the Communist autocracy that has governed the country for 13 years.
   Hundreds were already lined up at polling places at schools,
Buddhist temples and government offices in this capital city when
the polls opened in the morning.
   The 1.8 million eligible voters of this impoverished Southeast
Asian nation of 3.8 million people were electing the Supreme
People's Council, the highest state body. Officials said 121
candidates, mostly Communist Party members, are running for 79
seats on the body.
   The council was established when the Communists seized power in
December 1975.
   Some foreign analysts said the election is intended to convince
the world Laos was stable and an attractive country for foreign
investment, trade and foreign aid.
   In an interview last week, Thai political scientist Sirichai
Sirikai said the election is designed only to consolidate the power
of the Communist hierarchy and convince the world of Laos'
political stability.
   As he arrived at a temple to cast his ballot, Sisomphon
Lavansay, the chairman of the Supreme People's Council, was asked
by journalists about reports of major government changes following
the election.
   ``There will be no changes,'' he replied, adding that the
council will not select a new premier. Sisomphon refused to reply
when asked if he would be retiring.
   Thailand's ambassador to Laos and the Thai media had quoted
reports that some elderly officials may retire after the election,
including Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihane, 68; acting President
Phoumi Vongvichit, 80; and Sisomphon, 72.
   However, Somsavath Lengsavad, permanent secretary of the
National Election Committee, had called the election ``another step
toward socialist democracy.''
   He said results from the country's 4,153 polling stations would
be counted by hand, and the final tally would not be known for a
week to 10 days.
   The first nationwide district and provincial elections were held
last year.

   Millions of Soviets filled out ballots providing a
choice of candidates for the first time Sunday in parliamentary
elections that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called a triumph for
his vision of democracy.
   However, maverick candidate Boris N. Yeltsin, running to
represent Moscow in the new Congress of People's Deputies, claimed
many people are worried about the possibility of vote fraud and
ballot-box stuffing. He complained that the elections weren't
completely democratic.
   Moscow polling stations, brightly lit and festooned with red
banners and Soviet flags, opened at 7 a.m. Observers reported light
voter turnout in the morning, but the official Tass news agency
said more people were heading for the polls later in the morning.
   Voters will elect 1,500 deputies of the new 2,250-member
congress, which later will choose the country's president and elect
from its own ranks delegates to a new full-time Supreme Soviet
legislature. The congress itself will meet once a year.
   Official public organizations, ranging from the Communist Party
to a national association for book lovers, are directly electing
750 delegates to the new assembly.
   In Sunday's voting, hundreds of races were being contested for
the first time in 70 years, a major change in Soviet politics. In
the past, the Communist Party has allowed only one approved
candidate to run for each seat.
   Gorbachev, who voted with his wife Raisa at a polling station at
Moscow's Institute of Chemical Physics, told reporters afterward
the sometimes boisterous campaign was just what the Kremlin
leadership wanted.
   ``The electoral law that we passed has justified our hopes,''
Gorbachev said. ``It has advanced the political thought and social
activity of the people, and this is what we wanted to achieve.''
   While it was still Saturday evening in the capital, voters in
the Soviet Far East began casting ballots in voting stations 11
time zones away.
   Aboard the orbiting Mir space station, cosmonauts Alexander
Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and Valery Polyakov were also among the
first to vote, radioing their choice to Earth, Tass said.
   The Soviet voting age is 18, and about 190 million of the 285
million Soviets are eligible to vote, according to the Central
Election Commission. Voting is not mandatory and ballots are
secret, Tass said.
   Nearly 180,000 polling stations nationwide opened Sunday morning
and will close at 8 p.m. local time. According to Tass, the first
election results are expected Sunday night, but full returns will
not be known for about 10 days.

   Pope John Paul II proclaimed an Easter
Sunday message of hope tinged with sadness, recalling those
persecuted for their faith, the breakup of families, and sectarian
strife.
   About 100,000 pilgrims, tourists and Romans jammed into Saint
Peter's square to hear the pope say mid-morning Easter Mass on the
steps of Christianity's largest basilica.
   He later moved to the balcony to deliver his speech and Easter
greetings in 55 languages. By then, the crowd had nearly doubled,
spilling over into narrow and cobblestone streets surrounding
Vatican City.
   Keeping with Easter tradition, the pope, who is head of the
Roman Catholic Church and titular bishop of Rome, delivered his
Easter message ``Urbi et Orbi,'' Latin meaning ``to the city and
the world.''
   On Easter, Christians celebrate their belief in the resurrection
of Christ from his tomb following his death on the cross on Good
Friday.
   Calling Easter ``the new Passover,'' in reference to the night
the Jews were miraculously saved in Egypt, the pope said: ``God
continues to pass (through the world) through the resurrection of
his son, the son of man....''
   ``God passes and frees from the fear that oppresses so many of
our brothers and sisters,'' John Paul said.
   ``He passes where there do not exist conditions worthy of a
truly human life,'' the pope added. He cited poor housing, broken
marriages, prostitution, and countries where people cannot freely
worship.
   He did not name any country.
   ``God passes where ... the longed-for peace is not yet to be
seen,'' the pope said, singling out sectarian strife in Lebanon.
   ``God still passes and sets free the whole of creation .... In
his blood all is reconciled: man with God, with himself, with
nature,'' the pope said. ``At this point, the responsibility of man
gains new strength and awareness ....
   ``This is the truth which Easter proclaims to today's world,
which is so many ways seems to be rushing headlong towards
self-destruction and death,'' the pope said.

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the
first woman to lead a modern Moslem nation, is expecting her second
child in October, family sources said Sunday.
   Ms. Bhutto's first child, a boy named Bilawal, was born last
Sept. 21. A month later, Ms. Bhutto propelled her left-of-center
Pakistan People's Party to a victory in the country's first free
elections in more than a decade.
   The prime minister's marriage in December 1987 was reported to
have been arranged in line with strict Moslem tradition. She
married Asif Zardari, a prominent landowner from Pakistan's western
province of Baluchistan.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, was pregnant with her first child last year when
Pakistan's military leader, Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, announced
elections.
   Zia overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a
bloodless coup in 1977, and Bhutto was convicted of conspiracy to
murder a political rival and executed in 1979.
   Zia died in a plane crash in August. Investigators suspect that
sabotage brought down the plane, but they have never found a
definite cause or suspect.

<HEAD>It's Crunch Time For Brady Third World Debt Relief Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's heralded plan to
relieve the staggering Third World debt burden faces its first big
test this week when Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady tries to sell
the proposal to finance ministers from around the world.
   The sales talk will come at the spring meeting of the 151-nation
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the two major lending
organizations, and at a separate strategy session attended by
officials from the seven largest industrial countries.
   The sessions should be lively. Already, the Brady plan is being
viewed as a crucial watershed for the 7-year debt crisis, which has
at various times threatened financial calamity for major U.S. banks
and turned Latin America into a political time bomb as struggling
democracies in the region tried to cope with growing debt
repayments.
   The Brady plan, as the new initiative is being called, seeks to
encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of the $1.3
trillion in debt owed by poor countries in return for guarantees
backed by the IMF and World Bank that the remaining pool of debt
will be repaid.
   The new administration received high marks for abandoning what
many considered to be the failed policies of the Reagan
administration, which repeatedly refused to endorse any broad-scale
effort at debt forgiveness.
   But critics, including many of the largest debtor countries,
complain that the Brady proposal does not go far enough, especially
in view of the economic and political pressures building in much of
Latin America.
   Riots in Venezuela last month left more than 300 people dead
after the government announced a new austerity program implemented
to please the IMF and other creditors who hold $33 billion of that
country's debt.
   The administration is hoping to come out of the IMF and World
Bank session with a general endorsement of the principles of the
new debt approach when the meetings wrap up on April 4. But many of
the debtor countries are pushing for quick debt relief to accompany
the rhetoric.
   Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez has termed the Brady
proposals ``very timid'' and officials in that country are already
saying they may have to defer debt repayments if they don't get
help soon. Similar warnings have come from Mexico.
   Some observers say that the Brady plan, while attempting to
resolve the debt crisis, may initially lead to a greater period of
instability as debtors balk at meeting obligations on their old
debt while they wait to see the details of the debt relief packages.
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who played a
leading role in the initial U.S. response to the debt crisis in
1982, has warned that debt reduction could end up hurting both
creditor and debtor countries if not properly managed.
   Most observers believe the United States must come up with
concrete results quickly, at least with new initiatives for Mexico
and Venezuela, or risk more turmoil because of dashed expectations.
   ``It is important that debtor nations not get their expectations
too high. The Brady proposal represents measured improvement, not
radical relief,'' said William Cline, an economist with the
Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford, the key architect of
the Brady plan, says the administration's goal is to reduce the
total debt burden of 39 heavily indebted countries by 20 percent
over a three-year period with a similar 20 percent reduction in
interest payments.
   The Treasury believes that commercial banks can be enticed into
writing off a portion of their Third World loans by getting the IMF
and World Bank to earmark an unspecified amount of funds to
essentially guarantee the payments on the remaining level of debt.
   Officials of the lending organizations, while generally
supportive of the Brady proposals, said they need to see details on
just how much money they will be expected to put up.
   In addition to trying to line up support with the two major
lending organizations, Brady faces the task of selling his
proposals to officials of the world's largest industrial countries.
Finance ministers and central bank presidents of the so-called
Group of Seven, composed of the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Canada and Italy, will hold daylong discussions
which are expected to focus on the debt plan.
   Brady used a similar get-acquainted session in February to sound
out U.S. allies to the debt proposal the administration was
crafting.
   Based on initial comments, many observers expect the Bush
administration will win at least general agreement from the debtor
and creditor countries and officials at the world lending
organizations that the U.S. proposals are worth pursuing.
   ``The less-developed countries are now expecting something to be
done and that means something has to be done,'' said David Wyss,
chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., consulting firm. ``Brady has clearly signalled the direction
in which things will move.''

   In a new play about Menachem Begin, the
enigmatic former Israeli leader fantasizes about bombing Germany to
retaliate for the Holocaust and imagines being mobbed by admirers
after ending his self-imposed seclusion.
   The one-man play was written for the Israel Festival in May but
was rejected by festival officials who feared such free-wheeling
treatment of the 75-year-old Begin was too controversial.
   The rejection highlights the ambivalence and strong emotions
Begin still generates among Israelis nearly six years after he
unexpectedly resigned as prime minister and shut himself in his
two-story apartment at the edge of the Jerusalem pine forest.
   ``To the nationalists, Begin is a sacred man, a symbol of
everything that is pure and good. To those on the left, he stands
for everything they despise,'' said Ehud Sprinzak, a Hebrew
University professor and expert on right-wing Israeli politics.
   Begin became prime minister in 1977, the first from the
right-wing Likud bloc to hold the post. Two years later, he signed
the historic peace treaty with Egypt, sharing the Nobel Peace Prize
with President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. He resigned in 1983 at the
height of the war in Lebanon.
   Today, Begin's life is shrouded in mystery, frustrating
biographers and heightening curiosity among Israelis.
   He ventures outside his apartment for a public appearance only
once a year to attend a memorial service for his wife, Aliza, who
died in 1982.
   Begin breaks his silence rarely, usually to comment briefly on
the radio about history. He refuses to discuss his resignation,
commonly attributed to depression over the death of his wife and
the Lebanon war, in which more than 600 Israelis died.
   On Sunday, Begin commented on the 10th anniversary of the
Israel-Egypt peace accord, taking the unusual step of speaking
about current politics and criticizing the new American dialogue
with the PLO as ``a negative, harmful phenomenon.''
   He spends his days reading books, mostly biographies and
history, said longtime Begin aide Yehiel Kadishai. He said Begin
keeps up with news programs, reads Israeli and foreign newspapers,
and answers several dozen letters a week.
   Once an avid movie-goer, he now watches videos in the evenings.
``He likes Westerns,'' said Kadishai, adding that the former prime
minister also used to watch the American soap opera ``Dallas.''
   American oil magnate Armand Hammer offered to donate $750,000 to
Begin's favorite charity if the former prime minister wrote his
autobiography, but Begin has declined, Kadishai said.
   His family, aides and friends refuse to talk about Begin in what
Israeli journalists have described as a wall of silence.
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor, a longtime friend, visits Begin
every Friday to talk politics. When asked for details about the
talks, Meridor balked. ``I've never spoken about my conversations
with Begin.''
   Israeli journalist Amnon Dankner tried to skirt these obstacles
and probe the former prime minister's psyche in his one-man play,
titled simply ``Begin.''
   In one scene, Begin imagines ending his seclusion. ``People will
see me and will be amazed,'' he says, dreaming of a crowd cheering
and shouting ``long live Begin.''
   But then he stops himself and asks: ``What would be the point of
all those years? All the silence, the self-imprisonment?''
   In another scene, Begin fantasizes about ordering a strike
against Germany in retaliation for the Nazi Holocaust in which 6
million Jews, including Begin's parents and brother, were killed.
   ``On that day, bodies would pile up at the entrances of towns
and squares, like they were piled up at the entrances of the
camps,'' says the Begin character.
   Dankner said he and many other Israelis share these revenge
fantasies, adding that Begin's ability to articulate such emotions
was at the root of his popularity.
   ``In every Israeli, there is a little Begin,'' he said. `` He
expressed our fears, our nightmares, our delusions of grandeur.''
   Even today, the mention of Begin sparks strong reactions.
   During an election rally last fall, Likud followers listened
politely to speeches by party leaders, but at the mention of
Begin's name worked themselves into a frenzy, clapping and shouting
the name of the former leader for several minutes.
   But anger toward Begin has remained just as strong.
   While Begin celebrated his birthday last summer, a crowd
gathered outside his apartment, including a Jerusalem woman whose
son was killed in the June 1982 Lebanon invasion.
   ``This man caused dozens of young men not to reach even their
20th birthdays,'' said the woman, Raya Harnik. ``In the middle of
the war he just said he couldn't go on any longer. The bereaved
parents never had such a privilege.''

<HEAD>Time Flies When You're Having Fun Doing Your Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a five-year, $1.9 million study, the
Internal Revenue Service has concluded that the average taxpayer
should be able to fill out Form 1040, the dreaded individual income
tax return, in exactly 3 hours and 7 minutes.
   But if it's past midnight, and you're lost in a thicket of
deductions, exemptions, credits, exclusions and exceptions, you've
got a splitting headache, the clock is ticking away and you're
getting angrier by the minute, the IRS would like to hear your
complaint.
   This year, for the first time, IRS instructions for more than
350 tax forms includes an estimate of how long it takes to complete
each one.
   Time estimates also appear on the thousands upon thousands of
forms required by every other federal agency _ all under a new rule
issued by the Office of Management and Budget to implement the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
   The notices also include the name and address of an official to
contact if someone wants to complain about a form or dispute a time
estimate.
   The idea is that if enough people complain, bureaucrats will
feel pressured to simplify the forms _ or perhaps to shorten some
or eliminate them altogether _ in the interest of easing the burden
of government paperwork.
   Altogether, the IRS says, the total time the average taxpayer
should spend on Form 1040 is 9 hours and 17 minutes. That includes
3 hours and 7 minutes of record keeping, 2 hours and 28 minutes to
learn about the form, 3 hours and 7 minutes to actually fill it out
and 35 minutes to assemble the documents, copy them and send them
to the IRS.
   If the taxpayer itemizes deductions, add 4 hours and 34 minutes
for completing Schedule A, which lists deductions. That makes a
total of 13 hours and 51 minutes.
   The IRS man with the stopwatch was James Iocozzia, a statistical
researcher who helped develop the computerized time-motion study
conducted by a private management consultant, Arthur B. Little Inc.
of Cambridge, Mass.
   The exhaustive study, which began in 1983 and ended last summer,
included sending 10-page questionnaires to 6,200 individuals and
more than 4,000 businesses and tax preparers. A separate group of
750 taxpayers kept yearlong diaries recording the time they spent
on all tax-related activities, such as tossing receipts into a
shoebox.
   When he figured his personal taxes recently, Iocozzia said, ``I
kept track of my time spent, and I came pretty close to what is
listed here.''
   The new OMB rule is the brainchild of Leon Transeau, chief
paperwork manager at the Interior Department, who estimates that
Americans probably spend 12.7 billion hours a year filling out
forms for the federal government.
   If their time is worth, say, $10 an hour, that means a $127
billion annual loss to the national economy, Transeau says.
   It's such a staggering task, he said, that the entire U.S. armed
forces _ all 2.2 million men and women on active duty _ could be
kept busy all year doing nothing else but completing government
forms. And they'd need an additional half-million people to finish
the job.
   This bothered Transeau enough to call a meeting of fellow
paperwork managers in other agencies to talk about it. When he
suggested printing time estimates on every form, he recalled, the
room fell silent.
   Then the bickering began. Someone protested that blank spaces on
the forms would be eaten up.
   ``You mean to tell me that we don't want to change federal forms
to preserve doodling space for the American people?'' Transeau
responded.
   ``If we do this, people will write in and complain,'' a fellow
bureaucrat said. ``Then we'll have to change the damned forms.''
   ``That's the idea!'' Transeau replied.
   He said the new OMB rule, which he championed over the strenuous
objections of most federal agencies, already has had ``an enormous
impact'' in solving a problem that he believes shackles America's
competitive strength in world markets.
   ``Before anything happens in Washington, you've got to get to
the true magnitude of the problem,'' Transeau said. ``We now know
that the paperwork burden is far greater than we reported before.''
   The IRS, for example, has boosted sevenfold its previous
estimates of how long it takes taxpayers to complete its forms.
(Iocozzia says that's because the IRS formerly ignored such
activities as record keeping, which consumes 50 percent of a
taxpayer's time.)
   Transeau is still struggling to finish his own tax return before
the April 17 deadline. He laughs ruefully at the new IRS time
estimates.
   ``It's taking so long, I need professional help,'' he said. ``I
can't get through it. There's no way I'm going to finish in that
amount of time.''

<HEAD>Hunger Striker Suspends Fast After 37 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A detainee in critical
condition after 37 days on a hunger strike said Sunday he would
suspend his fast and hinted he may soon be released.
   In a separate development, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu told
residents of an impoverished township that black faction fighting
remains an obstacle in their struggle for political rights.
   Hunger striker Sandile Thusi, who has been fasting to protest
his detention without trial, said he decided to resume eating
following a Saturday meeting with anti-apartheid leader Rev. Frank
Chikane.
   Chikane also spoke Saturday to Minister of Law and Order Adriaan
Vlok about Thusi, who has staged the longest fast of the estimated
600 detainees who have participated in a hunger strike since
January to demand their freedom.
   Thusi said the negotiations between Chikane and Vlok were the
key to his decision to resume eating. His comment suggested there
has been some progress toward his release, but he would not say if
the government had given him any assurances that he will be freed.
   The government has said it would not consider Thusi's release
until he resumed eating. Chikane, meanwhile, said he will meet Vlok
this week for additional talks on the status of Thusi and other
detainees.
   Thusi, who is in the intensive care unit at St. Aidan's Hospital
in Durban, said in a statement he would begin eating Monday after
meeting with his family.
   The 26-year-old university researcher reportedly has lost 57
pounds, or about one-third of his weight, during his fast to
protest his nine-month detention without trial.
   Doctors have described his condition as critical and said he
risks blindness and brain damage if he continues to fast.
   The government says it has authorized the release of 580 people
in custody since the hunger strike began. Human rights groups say
several hundred activists remain held without charge. An estimated
30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths of time during
the 33-month-old state of emergency.
   Tutu delivered his Easter Sunday sermon to 600 people, including
dozens of uniformed policemen, at an Anglican Church service in
Mbekweni, a township about 45 miles east of Cape Town.
   ``There is no doubt that it is God's intention for us (blacks)
to be free in our land,'' said Tutu. ``For we do not want to
oppress anyone, we just want to live in peace and harmony and
happiness.''
   Several hundred township residents, including a band and drum
majorettes, sang and danced while they waited for the arrival of
Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner and the head of the
Anglican Church in southern Africa.
   ``I pray that we in this township will know that we are oppresed
because we are black,'' Tutu said. ``Therefore, we will be united
and not allow ourselves to be divided into warring factions. The
day we are so united there will be nothing to stop us.''
   There have been numerous black-on-black faction fights in recent
years, including 1986 battles in Cape Town between anti-apartheid
activists and pro-government vigilantes.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   A dispute over cooking oils is heating up as
farm state lawmakers and consumer groups join ranks on Capitol Hill
in what they say is literally a fight for the hearts of Americans.
   But underlying it all is a battle that has gone on for months
between agricultural producers. The fight matches U.S. soybean
farmers against foreign palm and coconut growers.
   ``It's a symptom of increased international competition that we
have today for all products,'' says Dan Reuwee, a spokesman for the
American Soybean Association.
   So far, the dispute has produced legislation as well as a war of
words in advertisements by both sides.
   At issue in Congress is a proposal by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,
and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to require more nutritional
information on food packages to help consumers know what vegetable
oils are used in products and how much cholesterol-raising
saturated fats they contain.
   At issue for producers is their share of the
multi-billion-dollar U.S. and international markets for edible
oils, which covers everything from salad dressings, cooking oils to
margarine.
   According to the Agriculture Department, soybean oil accounts
for more 70 percent of the edible oils used in the United States
while the so-called tropical oils _ palm, palm kernel and coconut
oils _ represent 4 percent. But internationally, tropical oils
dominate and the industry worries that worldwide sales could suffer
if the current health scare moves overseas from the United States.
   The U.S. farm group, by its own admission, helped start the
fight by persuading lawmakers to introduce legislation in 1987
targeting tropical oils as sources of cholesterol-raising saturated
fats.
   ``We'd be lying if we said we haven't taken advantage of the
health issue here to market our crop,'' says Reuwee. ``But it's
what any good marketing organization does.''
   Palm growers from Malaysia, the leading producer of the oil, are
striking back with a campaign to promote their product.
   ``We think we're getting a pretty bum rap from statements that
palm oil raises cholesterol when there isn't any evidence
whatsoever that this is true,'' says John Phipps, a spokesman for
the Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Association.
   The latest development came this month when Glickman and Harkin
introduced a new version of the legislation. The lawmakers
complained that some products claim to have ``no cholesterol'' or
are made with ``100 percent vegetable shortening'' although they
contain cooking oils with high levels of saturated fats.
   The American Heart Association, which supports the legislation,
says consumers can reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering the
amount of saturated fat in their diet.
   Lard is 41 percent saturated fat by weight. Palm oil contains 51
percent saturated fat; coconut oil, 92 percent; sunflower oil, 11
percent; corn oil, 13 percent; olive oil, 14 percent; and soybean
oil, 15 percent.
   In general, the legislation would require food labels to clearly
list all cooking oils contained in the product or disclose detailed
nutrition information, including the amount of total fat,
cholesterol and saturated fat.
   The previous bill would have required labels to identify
tropical oils as a ``saturated fat.'' Glickman and Harkin dropped
that provision in an effort to avoid continued opposition from
tropical oils producers, who blocked the original bill by arguing
it represented an international trade barrier.
   However, Phipps contends the new legislation still will hurt
tropical oil producers.
   ``It is safe to say that it does not really help their
predicament. Forcing a food company to put palm oil, coconut or
palm kernel oil down as a sole source oil probably would be
somewhat of a deterrent for food companies,'' says Phipps.
   He contends that negative publicity already has hurt the
industry. In fact, a group called the National Heart Savers
Association, led by a millionaire from Omaha, Neb., is conducting a
national advertising campaign against tropical oils using banner
headlines of ``The Poisoning of America.''
   Already nearly a dozen large food companies such as General
Mills and Pillsbury have announced they have stopped or are phasing
out the use of tropical oils from their products. Some products now
carry labels that say they contain no palm or coconut oils.
   Palm growers have countered with full-page ads of their own in
some of the nation's largest newspapers, decrying the ``smear
campaign'' against tropical oils. The industry also has
commissioned 30 scientific studies, including several at U.S.
universities, on the health effects of palm oil.
   Last year, the Food and Drug Administration opposed labeling
legislation, saying tropical oils contribute less than 8 percent of
saturated fat intake by American consumers. In contrast, 70-75
percent of saturated fats in U.S. diets come from consumption of
meats, poultry, milk, cheese, butter and eggs.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said on Sunday the
parliamentary election, which offered Soviets a choice of
candidates in many cases, can ensure democracy while preserving the
one-party rule of the communists.
   The Soviet president spoke after he and his wife Raisa voted at
a gold-and-white building in the Lenin Hills area that houses the
National Associatedion of Soviet Chemists and part of the Semyonov
Institute of Chemical Physics.
   They chose between Boris N. Yeltsin, a popular maverick who
Gorbachev ousted as Moscow Communist Party chief, and Yevgeny
Brakov, the director of the giant ZIL automobile factory, for a
seat representing Moscow in the new 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies.
   For a second seat, representing their Oktyabr region of Moscow,
they chose between two relatively young and lesser-known
candidates: Ilya Zaslavsky, a 28-year-old scientific worker at the
Moscow Textile Institute, and Alexander Krutov, a Soviet televison
commentator.
   Gorbachev wouldn't say for whom he voted in either case. He told
Soviet and foreign correspondents gathered in a cold mist on the
steps of the building that he voted ``for a candidate who was
nominated.''
   ``This is a secret ballot,'' he reminded them.
   The president said his policies of pressing for more democracy
and openness in Soviet society, while not permitting any legal
opposition to the Communist Party, are ``the key to opening the
potential of our socialist society, with the purpose of taking into
account the various interests of people and harmonizing them on the
basis of consensus or a majority.''
   Gorbachev said political pluralism is ``not a panacea for
solving problems and expressing a plurality of opinions.''
   Despite calls by some protesters for a multiparty system,
Gorbachev said he was confident most Soviets supported his views.
   The Communist Party has launched an investigation into charges
that Yeltsin advocates a multiparty system, which is not permitted
under the law.
   Gorbachev said he was satisfied with the election law approved
in December, saying it ``advanced the political thought and social
activity of people.''
   Officials knew when they wrote the law that it would need
perfecting and that the experience of the three-month campaign
would help them make corrections, Gorbachev said. But he did not
say what changes he would support.
   Gorbachev was not a candidate in Sunday's balloting, having
already been elected to the new parliament on March 14 as one of
100 deputies picked directly by the Communist Party.
   Voters elected 1,500 deputies Sunday to represent various
geographic districts throughout the country. For the first time in
decades, Soviets had a choice of candidates for many of the seats.
   The other 650 were being chosen from the party, its affiliates,
social, professional and trade union organizations.
   Gorbachev said he supported competition at all levels of the
election campaign but saw no contradiction in the party's
nominating only 100 candidates for 100 seats. He said many more
candidates' names were considered before the nominations were
announced.

   Legislators who passed the nation's first
law requiring instant background checks on people wanting to buy
certain guns say they hope to end Virginia's reputation as a
supplier of firearms to drug dealers.
   The deadline for signing the bill is midnight Monday; Gov.
Gerald L. Baliles has said he supports the measure and is expected
to sign it. It would take effect Nov. 1.
   Debate on the bill saw weapons drawn in the halls of the General
Assembly.
   The sponsor of the measure took a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault
rifle to a Senate committee hearing, saying he wanted to show that
dangerous guns can be sold to anyone who has the money. Sen. M.E.
``Sonny'' Stallings said the gun was similar to one that was used
to wound him when he served in Vietnam.
   The measure awaiting Baliles' signature is designed to keep
assault rifles and handguns with barrels 5 inches long or less out
of the hands of convicted and wanted felons. It sets up instant
background checks on resident purchasers; non-residents may have to
wait up to a week while the checks are made before they can take
home a gun.
   The system will be similar to that used by merchants checking
the validity of a credit card. Gun dealers, after checking a
purchaser's identification, will call a toll-free number operated
by the State Police. In minutes, an officer at a State Police
computer terminal will determine if the purchaser has a criminal
record.
   At present in Virginia, there are no identification requirements
or other state restrictions on gun purchases. Gun owners who want
to carry a concealed weapon need a permit, but for others, no
license is required and no registration files are maintained.
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry referred to the state's reputation
as a gun exporter a week ago when he put some of the blame for his
city's high murder rate on Virginia guns.
   The impetus for the measure came in December when a student at a
school in Stallings' hometown of Virginia Beach was charged with
killing a teacher and wounding another with an assault gun.
   The final measure, which passed the Senate 33-6 and the House of
Delegates 81-15 in February, was a carefully crafted compromise to
satisfy gun dealers, gun control advocates and firearms owners.
   ``What we basically have is a win-win situation from the
standpoint of everyone concerned,'' said Raymond W. Cahen of the
Virginia State Rifle and Revolver Association.
   Gun owners lobbied for the instant-check provision because they
did not want gun buyers to have to wait for days before taking home
their purchases. They also won a provision preventing information
in criminal background checks from being used as registration files.
   Gun dealers lobbied to make sure they would not be swamped with
paperwork. The law places most of the record-keeping burden on
State Police.
   Advocates of gun control wanted an outright ban on sales of
military-type rifles and small handguns but accepted background
checks as a first step.
   State Delegate C. Richard Cranwell, who wrote most of the
compromise language, said his aim was to fix Virginia's reputation
as an exporter of guns to East Coast drug dealers.
   ``I want to make sure those people buy their firearms somewhere
else,'' he said.
   Charles Cunningham, state liaison with the National Rifle
Association in Washington, said Virginia is the first state to have
an instant background checks law, although the Justice Department
is looking into such a requirement nationwide.
   Cunningham said the NRA wants instant checks to replace waiting
periods or license requirements in states that have such laws.

   A new coalition Cabinet on Sunday
endorsed a tentative peace agreement with southern rebels, calling
for an immediate cease-fire to a six-year civil war that has
created a severe famine.
   The peace plan was the first act of the Cabinet of the war-weary
country.
   The war costs the faltering economy $1 million a day, and the
famine has killed hundreds of thousands of southerners.
   The peace plan calls for a controversial suspension of Islamic
laws _ a rebel demand that has kept Sudan's Moslem fundamentalist
National Islamic Front from joining a Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's
coalition government, which includes all other parties and interest
groups.
   An immediate cease-fire also is called for in the agreement.
   Information and Culture Minister Hussein Abu-Saleh told
reporters the Cabinet has decided to form a committee headed by
Foreign Minister Sidahmed Hussein to start contacts with the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Organization.
   ``The Cabinet has agreed on the peace initiative,'' Abu-Saleh
told reporters. ``The committee will be in continued session as
from now to see ways for contacting the (rebel) movement.''
   Rebels led by Col. John Garang signed the agreement Nov. 16 with
the centrist Democratic Unionist Party, then the senior partner in
Mahdi's Cabinet.
   It calls for lifting the state of emergency in effect since
President Gaafar Nimeiri was overthrown in April 1985, and a
constitutional conference to negotiate peace.
   Initially, Mahdi refused to sign the agreement, maneuvring to
deprive the Unionists of credit for reaching a settlement where his
own party failed.
   This prompted the Unionists to quit the government in December.
Mahdi replaced them with the Islamic Front.
   That move, coupled with a successful rebel offensive to capture
a number of strategic garrison towns, led the army to intervene and
issue an ultimatum for Mahdi to resign or form a broad-based
Cabinet to bring peace. Political parties and trade and
professional unions supported the army's demands.
   Mahdi finally complied and, after repeated delays, swore in his
new Cabinet on Saturday.
   If the government succeeds in starting peace talks and calling a
cease-fire, it would greatly help an international relief operation
coordinated to send 100,000 tons of food and supplies to the south
before the rainy season starts May.
   The United Nations has warned that 100,000 to 600,000 people
could die in southern Sudan this summer if the operation fails.
   Garang's rebels have been fighting for economic reforms, more
autonomy and end to the Islamic laws decreed by Nimeiri in 1983.
They were suspended when Nimeiri was ousted in 1985.
   But the Parliament had been debating alternative laws based on
the same harsh criminal punishments that include amputating limbs
of thieves, flogging those who drink alcohol and stoning adulterers
regardless of their religious affiliation.

<HEAD>House Speaker Walks Delicate Line</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright seems keenly aware
that he's walking a fine line in leading the Democrats while
besieged by an ethics committee probe of his personal finances.
   ``If you are unyielding, an absolutist, you're criticized for
being a tyrant. And if you're cooperative and conciliatory, you're
criticized for being so weak you had to make concessions,'' Wright
mused last week.
   The subject was Democratic concessions on the minimum wage bill,
but the speaker's comment could have applied to any issue that
comes his way these days.
   The ethics investigation places the Texas Democrat, a member of
the House for 34 years and its speaker since 1987, in the worst
danger of his political career.
   If the panel's judgment is harsh, he could become the first
speaker ever forced to resign the leadership post. As everyone
waits for the verdict there is unease among the Democrats.
   At a news conference Friday following announcement of a new
bipartisan agreement with President Bush on a Central American
policy, Wright's top deputies made a point of praising the
speaker's efforts.
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the House Majority Whip, grabbed the
microphones to make sure reporters knew the plan was the direct
descendent of a 1987 effort by Wright. Wright had stuck to his guns
despite skepticism even among his colleagues, and showed ``a
willingness to take the heat, to give peace a chance,'' he said.
   ``If the speaker did not take the action at that point, we would
not be here today,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   Until proven otherwise, most House Democrats are operating under
the assumption that Wright will be cleared by the ethics committee.
   ``I think the speaker has an enormous margin of wait-and-see
support,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., although ``a damaging
report would be very difficult for the speaker.''
   ``My sense is a majority of Democrats do not expect the report
to be damaging, but recognize the report will be used by the
speaker's detractors and could be turned into a damaging tool,''
said Williams, one of Wright's close allies.
   Most Democrats, many of whom were reluctant to discuss the
matter, echoed Williams' sentiments. The party is unlikely to
abandon its speaker unless the ethics committee, which resumes its
deliberations next month, recommends disciplinary action.
   ``If a majority of members thought that a person ought to be
reprimanded, I believe that's inconsistent with the speakership,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   ``The unknown bothers people,'' said Coelho, the chief
Democratic vote-counter. But Wright's power as speaker has not been
diminished, he said. ``His support is solid. I don't see any
lessening of support.''
   There has been much less legislative activity in the House this
year than two years ago, when Wright first became speaker and had
an active agenda. In this Congress, Wright has repeatedly said the
House was awaiting an agenda from the president.
   Two years ago, Wright was faced with a presidential proposal for
a congressional pay raise and was able to maneuver so the raise
took effect. This year, when a larger raise was proposed, Wright
took a political black eye while the raise was killed.
   Last week, Wright's most vocal opponent, Republican Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, was elected the House Minority Whip. Gingrich
said one of the reasons he won was his attacks on Wright, including
the filing of the complaint that launched the ethics probe.
   To Democrats, Gingrich represents the GOP's hard-line approach
toward politics, aimed at wresting away control of the House for
the first time in more than three decades.
   But, curiously, many Democrats feel better about Wright since
Gingrich's elevation. Gingrich himself is controversial and, in a
leadership position, a much better target for the Democrats.
   ``It has sort of taken some of the sting out because people can
go after him,'' Coelho said.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., the chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, called Gingrich ``a gold mine''
for the Democrats, who are threatening to make him a target of an
ethics probe.
   But Anthony said he was not sure attacking Gingrich would
provide much political cover for Democrats to protect Wright.
   ``I think the Wright (situation) is separate and apart, and it
has to be judged on its own merits, based on the findings of the
committee,'' he said.

   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin broke his
silence on political affairs Sunday by using the 10th anniversary
of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty to criticize the United States
for opening talks with the PLO.
   Begin and the other surviving architect of th historic treaty,
former President Jimmy Carter, praised the pact but expressed
regret that it did not lead to a comprehensive settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the pact assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat four years after he signed it.
   There were no official ceremonies marking the occasion,
reflecting the chilly relations between the two former Middle East
adversaries, mainly over the lack of a solution to the Palestinian
problem.
   Israeli students did, however, sponsor a ``peace party'' at a
convention center in Jerusalem to mark the occasion of the signing
of Israel's only peace treaty with an Arab state.
   No official ceremonies were held in Egypt either, and only one
government- controlled newspaper mentioned the anniversary.
   Columnist Anis Mansour wrote in the al-Ahram newspaper that
although Arab countries accused Egypt of treason when the treaty
was signed, they now agree on the need for negotiations to
peacefully end the conflict.
   Israel's army radio broadcast interviews with U.S., Israeli and
Egyptian politicians and even played Egyptian music and Hebrew
peace songs that led the pop charts a decade ago.
   The 75-year-old Begin took issue with Washington's latest peace
move, the U.S. dialogue with the Palestinian Liberation
Organization in Tunisia that broke a 13-year American boycott of
Yasser Arafat's organization.
   ``This is in my opinion a negative, harmful phenomenon,'' he
said in his characteristically hoarse voice. ``The Americans, our
friends, are in essence asked to reconsider this matter.''
   Begin said he opposed formation of a Palestinian state in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as ``a danger to Israel and the
entire Middle East.''
   He complained that Palestinians persisted in clashing with
Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands and sending guerrillas to
raid northern Israel.
   ``If this isn't terror, it is difficult to know what terror
is,'' he said, referring to Arafat's renunciation of terror and
recognition of Israel's right to exist that led to the Americans
opening up a dialogue with PLO.
   The uprising in the occupied lands is now in its 16th month and
more than 400 Palestinians have been killed in the revolt, most by
army gunfire at stone-throwing youths. Eighteen Israelis also have
been killed.
   Referring to the treaty with Egypt, Begin said: ``I have the
feeling we achieved something very important, peace.''
   Begin, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Sadat, reportedly
became depressed over the death of his wife Aliza and Israel's
losses in the Lebanon war. He resigned suddenly in 1983 and has
lived in seclusion ever since.
   Carter was one of a half-dozen international figures connected
with the 1979 treaty interviewed on Israel radio on the anniversary.
   Carter, 64, applauded the peace agreement's survival through
persistent Middle East violence, noting especially that it was not
upset by Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   ``Both sides have courageously complied with the terms of the
peace treaty,'' said Carter, who negotiated the accords at Camp
David in Maryland between Begin and Sadat in September 1978.
   The following March 26, the three men signed the Israeli-Egypt
peace treaty on the White House lawn.
   But Carter said he regretted that the peace pact did not spur
other accords with Palestinians and Israel's Arab neighbors.
   ``My expectations and hopes and dreams were that building upon
the principles established in the Camp David accords, that we would
see a fairly rapid series of bilateral talks or negotiations
between Israel and her neighbors, including the Palestinians,''
Carter said in an interview broadcast on Israel's army radio.
   The Camp David accords offered a wide-ranging framework for
settling the Arab-Israei conflict, calling on Israel, Jordan and
Egypt to help negotiate a resolution of the Palestinian problem.
   They called for a five-year period of autonomy for Palestinians
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as an interim solution
before a final settlement was negotiated.
   ``That principle has not changed. I think it is still a good
prescription for the future,'' said Carter.
   Palestinians rejected the plan at the time because it failed to
guarantee them an independent state or a negotiating role for the
PLO, still key issues in the dispute today.

<HEAD>Yellowstone Park Fights Fire Aftermath: Drop in Tourism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yellowstone, its image
hurt by fires, starving elk and the slaughter of bison, is the
focus of a high-powered public relations effort to restore the
gleam to the national park system's crown jewel.
   Nature is slowly healing the wounds left from the summer of
1988's forest fires that burned nearly 1 million acres of the
2.2-million-acre park. But Yellowstone's magical lure is being
crippled by vivid images of 200-foot-tall walls of flame that were
projected into America's homes by television last year.
   ``The more sensationalistic coverage led the public to believe
that Yellowstone simply burned up, that there was nothing left,''
said Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. ``That's very far from
the truth. The park is open, it's alive, it's well.''
   Thick blankets of snow are slowly melting, uncovering in the
park a new landscape. In some areas, where visitors once could not
see beyond the green needles on the first phalanx of pines, the eye
can now scan up hillsides of charred tree trunks. Lining sections
of the Grand Loop that circles through Yellowstone's interior are
blackened skeletons of once-majestic lodgepole pines.
   But in other areas, grass and wildflowers are sprouting along
with lodgepole seedlings that got their start when the fires seared
open pine cones, scattering seeds.
   Higher than usual numbers of winter deaths of elk and Montana's
hunting of bison that roam north of the park's boundary have also
hurt Yellowstone's image.
   Park biologists agree some of the elk deaths can be traced to
starvation stemming from the fire damage. But they also point out
that recent mild winters and lush summers let some elk live beyond
their normal years and so this year's more typical Yellowstone
winter was bound to kill large numbers.
   As for the buffalo, there are killed when they wander outside
the park because of the fear they may bring disease to livestock.
   Yellowstone defenders stress that the park is intended to be a
natural environment, with death and fire as natural as regrowth and
rebirth.
   ``The very simple solution to all of this would be to put up a
12-foot high cyclone fence around Yellowstone National Park, and we
can now keep the buffalo in,'' said Steve Shimek, a spokesman for
Travel Montana, a branch of that state's Commerce Department. ``And
then we bring in the hay trucks and we feed all the elk and we keep
them nice and fat, and then we put out all the pesky fires.
   ``As a tourism product, we compete with a New York zoo,'' said
Shimek. ``Montana is not interested in competing with a New York
zoo. Montana is interested in competing on the level of a wild,
natural place.''
   Getting the public to understand that concept and return to
Yellowstone is costing Wyoming and Montana hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
   Surveys taken in recent months found that many people said they
were less likely to come to Yellowstone and many tourism counselors
foresaw a falloff in trips there.
   Gene Bryan, director of Wyoming's Travel Commission, is sending
media kits to 3,000 travel writers throughout the world. Those kits
contain a fact sheet on what the fires did and didn't do, a story
on the park's recovery program and an outline of the rehabilitation
work.
   Also outlined are the projects the Park Service is putting
together to explain the ecological role of fire. Those projects
will include an exhibit center and ``wayside exhibits'' along
Yellowstone's road system that will describe where the fires roared
and what they did.
   Also planned are nature trails that will lead visitors through
burned and unburned areas.
   In the weeks to come, TV stations in the nation's major markets
will receive videotapes depicting Yellowstone's rebirth. Tour
operators also will be escorted through Yellowstone to show them
the park is still an attractive destination.
   The goal behind Wyoming's decision to spend roughly $600,000 on
the tourism campaign is to reverse the dip in advance bookings for
the coming season, which at one point were running 33 percent
behind normal for this time of year.
   ``Bookings are still down,'' Bryan said, ``but there's a
definite trend upwards.''

   History is repeating itself rather quickly in
the demand by Oliver North that former President Reagan come from
his home in California to testify for North at his criminal trial.
   There was a gap of 167 years between the time Thomas Jefferson
was subpoenaed and the 1974 summons to Richard Nixon, by then an
ex-president. Less than 15 years passed before the subpoena for
Reagan.
   During the 1974 Watergate cover-up trial, former aide John D.
Ehrlichman almost succeeded in his request for Nixon's appearance.
It would have happened, too, had the former president not fallen
critically ill following surgery.
   ``I would have loved to have Nixon in court, I had a few
questions I wanted to ask him myself,'' U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica wrote in his memoirs.
   But at the time, a team of court-appointed doctors determined
that Nixon would be in no condition to travel for some time, which
would have delayed the trial. ``I ruled reluctantly,'' Sirica
remembered of his decision that the former president would not have
to appear. ``I did feel that no matter how anxious many of us were
to see Nixon face the lawyers and testify under oath, having him in
court was not really critical to Ehrlichman's defense.''
   Had he gone on the witness stand, Nixon would have been the
first ex-president to do so under subpoena. That dubious
distinction will fall to Reagan if U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell accedes to North's request.
   The debate whether a president must obey subpoenas and other
court orders dates to the beginning of the republic, and it is just
as volatile today as it was then.
   President Thomas Jefferson received a subpoena in 1807 demanding
that he turn over a letter sought by defense lawyers in the treason
case against Aaron Burr, Jefferson's first vice president.
   Burr wanted Jefferson to appear in court and testify about the
letter written to the president by one of Burr's alleged
co-conspirators. Chief Justice John Marshall, presiding over the
trial, declared that the president unlike a king was subject to law.
   Jefferson cited the independence of the executive branch of
government from the judicial branch and refused, at first, to
release the letter. Eventually, he turned it over but made clear
that his decision was voluntary and not in response to the subpoena.
   From then until Watergate, the concept of executive privilege
was never tested. No sitting president ever has testified in court
in a criminal trial, although several have provided testimony or
what might be considered an equivalent.
   It is not difficult to see why North's lawyers want Reagan to
testify. Defense attorney Brendan Sullivan has attempted to show,
in his cross examination of prosecution witnesses, that Reagan was
much more involved in the secret aid to the Contra rebels than was
known publicly before.
   The jury heard that Reagan personally approved an
NSC-recommended deal in 1985 to give Honduras $110 million in
covert economic and military aid as an inducement to support the
Contras.
   The jury also heard that Reagan apparently approved a plan from
North and others in the government to airdrop intelligence data and
recoilless rifles to the Contras for the purpose of destroying
ships carrying arms to the Nicaraguan government.
   Those actions all were at a time when Congress had banned U.S.
military aid to the Contras.
   The closest the Supreme Court has come to ruling on so-called
executive privilege was in the Watergate tapes case of 1974. The
special prosecutor had subpoenaed the White House for tapes of 64
conversation and Nixon didn't want to give them up.
   In the case called Nixon v. U.S. the court ruled unanimously
that Nixon had to comply with the subpoena. The specific need for
evidence in a criminal case, the court said, outweighed the
president's rights in the matter.
   In 1975, President Gerald Ford gave a videotaped deposition as a
defense witness in the trial of Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme who was
convicted of attempting to assassinate Ford. Lawyers for the
administration tried unsuccessfully to have the court accept a
written statement by the president. The videotape was played in
court.
   Jimmy Carter, too, as president, gave videotaped testimony _
twice. Once was as a government witness in the perjury and gambling
trial of a Georgia state senator. The second time he taped
testimony for a federal grand jury that was investigating
allegations that fugitive financier Robert Vesco sought to bribe
members of the Carter administration.
   Reagan was served with the subpoena while he was still
president, along with then-Vice President Bush. Both men sought to
quash the subpoenas.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh argued in a Jan. 13 court
filing that the summonses ``raise profound constitutional concerns
... regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by
a former or sitting president.''
   He added that ``The spectacle of a former or sitting president
being subjected to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign
governments in the way they deal with the president now and in the
future.''
   On the day before the North trial started, Gesell ruled the
defendant had not shown that Bush had ``relevant and material''
testimony to give and squashed the subpoena against the new
president.
   But Gesell left the decision on Reagan open. He'll probably make
it this week when the defense starts presentation of its case.

<TEXT>
   Disposal of the kind of old dental fillings
taken from millions of mouths has Roy W. Ott's family-owned dental
supply company battling the Environmental Protection Agency.
   At the heart of the EPA's partially-settled dispute with Ott's
company, 58 dentists, three other dental supply concerns and three
individuals is how far the government can reach to hold parties
accountable for toxic waste contamination.
   Ott's case has aroused attention on Capitol Hill because some
lawmakers believe the EPA has overstepped its bounds in the name of
pollution prevention and accountability.
   The case hinges on amalgam _ the stuff that fillings are made of
_ and whether it can be considered a ``hazardous substance'' after
it has been removed from peoples' teeth.
   Ott's Pittsburgh company, which sells drill bits and other
dental equipment, says it bought amalgam from its dentist customers
and sold it to a Connecticut metal reclamation business.
   Amalgam is a hard, durable alloy of mercury and silver. Dentists
often save old fillings or leftover amalgam and sell it to
processors, who break it down into mercury or silver.
   In Ott's case, the EPA alleged that he and others sold amalgam
to metal processor Eugene Bourdeaudhui between 1969 and 1984. As a
result of Bourdeaudhui's efforts to break the amalgam down, the
agency said soil in Willington, Conn., became so polluted with
toxic mercury that it required a $710,000 cleanup in 1985.
   In seeking out responsible parties to pay for the cleanup, the
EPA stunned the nationwide dental community by going after not only
Bourdeaudhui but also 58 dentists and several dental suppliers who
did business with him.
   The dentists settled last June with the EPA, which then sued the
Ott Dental Supply Co.; Benco Dental Supply Co. of Wilkes-Barre,
Pa.; A. Leventhal &amp; Sons Inc. of Scranton, Pa.; and Smith-Holden
Inc. of Providence, R.I. Also sued were Bourdeaudhui; his former
wife, Elsie; and Edward Battle, an amalgam broker in Whitehall,
Pa., who also did business with Bourdeaudhui.
   On Feb. 16, the EPA announced that Benco, Leventhal and Mrs.
Bourdeaudhui settled for amounts ranging from $40,000 to $60,000.
The other four parties are still battling the suit.
   Ott's son, Kenneth, 36, said it is difficult for him to grasp
that his family's firm, which has six full-time employees, has
ended up in a federal court case about dental fillings.
   ``It's a question of liability and how far it can go ,'' the
younger Ott said. ``You can break water down into hydrogen and
oxygen. The hydrogen could explode and the oxygen could feed the
fire.''
   Ott said the EPA suit, which is being heard in a federal court
in Hartford, Conn., could wipe out the business that he had hoped
to take over from his father.
   ``The fact that dental amalgam is considered a hazardous waste
under Superfund comes as a surprise to many,'' said Rep. Doug
Walgren, D-Pa., in a recent letter to EPA. ``A substance which is
in my mouth _ and the mouths of millions of Americans _ and is
deemed `safe' by dentists and the American Dental Association
hardly seems a candidate for Superfund coverage.''
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., also wrote the EPA last month saying he
feared the case could discourage recycling by dentists.
   ``The precedent of making recyclers of products liable for the
hazardous byproducts of a recycling process that is not directly in
their control creates a major disincentive for recycling,'' Heinz
said.
   But the EPA said the case should make dentists and dental
suppliers more responsible.
   In announcing the settlements last month, EPA Regional
Administrator Michael R. Deland said the agreements ``demonstrate
that members of the dental community understand that they have a
responsibility to make themselves aware of dental amalgam's
ultimate disposal method and that the dental community _ which
controls the disposition of waste amalgam _ rather than taxpayers,
should bear the cost of cleanup.''

   The Bush administration is reviewing the need
for tougher U.S. curbs as well as expanded international
cooperation to help block the export to Third World countries of
chemicals and equipment for making poison gas weapons, a Commerce
Department official said Sunday.
   Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said the steps could include new legislation or at
least bolstered regulations for enforcing current export control
statutes.
   ``We're reviewing the strengthening of controls,'' he said,
noting that the policy review was being handled primarily by the
State and Commerce departments, with some input from the Central
Intelligence Agency.
   Freedenberg said he expects the review will be completed in the
next few months.
   ``Most likely we won't need legislation, we just need further
regulation,'' he said. ``And more importantly, I think it's likely
that we'll be looking for international cooperation.''
   Freedenberg said the United States and 16 other industrialized
nations have pledged to prevent the export of critical poison-gas
chemicals and manufacturing equipment to four ``problem countries''
_ Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria.
   But there are other mainly Third World countries, he said, which
are believed to be interested in developing a chemical-weapons
capability.
   ``You have a country such as Egypt _ which is right next door to
Libya and obviously has a concern about Libyan capacity to make
chemical weapons _ where there are no controls whatsoever on that
type of equipment or those chemicals,'' Freedenberg said.
   Other countries which either have poison gas or are developing
the capability of making it include Israel, India, Pakistan, Burma,
North Korea, Taiwan, China and Ethiopia.
   ``If you want to have a comprehensive, worldwide regime, you
have to have a regime that controls both the precursor chemicals
and the equipment to make chemical warfare agents to all the world
outside of the United States and the other 16 members of the
Australia group,'' Freedenberg said.
   The group of industrialized nations is so called because it was
formed at a meeting held at the Australian embassy in Brussels in
1985.

<HEAD>GOP Spending Doubled Democrats' in 1987-88 Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During the 1987-88 election cycle the
Republican Party raised and spent more than double the amount of
money taken in and spent by the Democrats, but the gap between the
two parties' financial strength was less than in 1983-84, the
Federal Election Commission said Sunday.
   A report issued by the commission said the GOP raised $263.3
million and spent $257 million in 1987-88, compared to $127.9
million raised and $121.9 million spent by the Democratic Party.
   By contrast, when President Reagan ran for re-election in
1983-84, the Republicans raised a record $297.9 million and spent
$300.8 million, while the Democrats raised $98.5 million and spent
$97.4 million.
   In 1987-88 the two parties were more closely matched in terms of
so-called coordinated expenditures _ monies spent on behalf of
federal candidates in the general election but not directly
contributed to their campaign coffers. Coordinated expenditures by
the GOP totalled $22.7 million, 27 percent more than the Democrats'
$17.9 million.
   The Democratic Party figure was nearly double the $9 million
spent in coordination with general election campaigns in 1983-84,
while coordinated expenditures by the Republican Party rose only 13
percent from the $20.1 million reported in the earlier two-year
period.
   During the most recent election cycle, direct contributions to
candidates totalled $3.4 million for the Republicans and $1.7
million for the Democrats, the FEC said.
   It reported that of the GOP's total 1987-88 receipts, 87 percent
came from individuals, 3 percent from state and local party
organizations, 1 percent from political action committees, or PACs,
and 9 percent from other sources. For the Democrats, the breakdown
was 68 percent from individuals, 6 percent from state and local
parties, 8 percent from PACs and 17 percent from other sources.

<HEAD>Washington State Officials Gear For First Execution in Decades</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Washington state has found a hangman
to execute a prisoner who walked away from a work-release program
to extract vengeance against a woman who testified against him
after he assaulted her years earlier.
   If Charles Rodman Campbell goes to the gallows Thursday morning
as scheduled, it would be the first hanging in the nation since
Kansas executed four men in 1965, including Richard Eugene Hickock
and Perry Edward Smith, whose story was told in the Truman Capote
book ``In Cold Blood.''
   The execution of Campbell, 34, for the brutal 1982 slayings of
Renae Wicklund, her daughter and a neighbor would be the state's
first in nearly 26 years.
   Campbell's last avenue of appeals was to begin Monday in the
U.S. District Court in Seattle, but federal courts have turned him
down in the past. His final state-level appeal ended last week when
the Supreme Court of Washington denied Campbell's request for a
stay of his execution, scheduled for 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
   Barring a stay, Campbell will die by hanging in the
high-ceilinged execution chamber at the Washington State
Penitentiary, unless he decides to choose lethal injection of
drugs, which he has so far refused to do. Hanging is Washington
state's official form of execution, although a prisoner may opt for
injection.
   A bill that would ban hanging and make lethal injection the sole
method of execution in Washington is stalled in a legislative
committee.
   Only three other states _ Montana, Delaware and New Hampshire _
still have hanging as their official form of execution, though none
has carried out a hanging in at least 40 years.
   In his appeal, Campbell argued that his rights were violated
when he was allowed to miss the jury selection process, even though
it was at his request. He also claimed he must serve prior
sentences before being executed and that the state's decision to
have two methods of execution violates his right to religious
freedom because he is forced to make a choice in his own death.
   Defense lawyer Al Lyon said he plans to use basically the same
appeal in federal court, ``packaged a little differently.''
   Campbell was convicted of leaving an Everett work-release center
on April 14, 1982, and going to the Clearview home of Ms. Wicklund,
31, whose testimony about a prior attack had sent him to prison for
sodomy and assault in 1974.
   She was severely beaten, her throat was slashed and she was
raped with a blunt instrument.
   Her daughter, 8-year-old Shannah, had her throat slashed so
violently she was nearly decapitated. A neighbor, Barbara
Hendrickson, 51, came to the Wicklunds' house during the murders
and also had her throat slashed.
   Because hangings are so rare in the United States, state
Department of Corrections officials had difficulty finding a
qualified executioner, said Rich Bauer, penitentiary spokesman.
   Prison Director Larry Kincheloe said the executioner was hired
in the United States for $1,500. Corrections officials are keeping
the person's identity secret, prompting the American Civil
Liberties Union to ask for public records to prove the
executioner's credentials.
   State and prison officials have said little about their
preparations for the execution, hoping to avoid the carnival
atmosphere that accompanied the recent execution in Florida of
another Washington state resident, Ted Bundy.
   ``We're trying to keep this as low-key as possible. We don't
want a circus, like Bundy's (execution),'' said Dick Milne,
spokesman for Gov. Booth Gardner.
   Opponents of capital punishment are gearing up for
demonstrations against Campbell's pending execution.
   ``It is a gruesome business,'' said Teresa Mathis, Seattle,
coordinator of the Washington Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty. ``I'm appalled we would put so much energy into doing it.''
   Demonstrations or candlelight vigils are planned at Walla Walla,
Seattle, Spokane and the state capital at Olympia, she said.
   Prison officials planned to beef up security around the prison
and to designate separate areas in a parking lot to keep opponents
and supporters of the death penalty apart, Bauer said.
   Campbell has had two previous execution dates postponed while
his appeals made their way through both state and federal courts.
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an earlier appeal.
   Prison records indicate Washington state executed 73 prisoners
by hanging, some two at a time, after taking over the duty from
counties in 1904. The present gallows were built in 1938.
   Chester J. Self, convicted of murder in the slaying of a Seattle
taxicab driver, was the last to die here, in June 1963.

   Sucker Fest 1989 has gone belly-up.
   You say that from the sound of it you won't miss it? But there
would have been fun things to do at the eighth annual festival
scheduled for April 7-9.
   Sucker Fest, named for the freshwater fish found in nearby
Saginaw Bay, has offered events including a chain saw log-cutting
contest and rope crossings of the Rifle River that runs through the
Arenac County community of 403 residents.
   But the City Council in Michigan's self-proclaimed smallest city
voted last week to cancel the event, not for lack of participation
but because it couldn't get insurance.

   It was a protest to end all protests.
   A group of college students staged a protest for no reason,
holding blank signs and distributing fliers that said nothing. They
insisted nothing was on their minds.
   ``The whole point is there are so many protests that people
don't read the signs and don't care anymore,'' said Bryan Finch,
22, a Cabrillo College student who organized Friday's
``non-protest'' and served as the official ``unspokesperson.''
   He said the group was protesting the trivialization of protests.
   ``People are making them worthless by doing them so much,'' said
Finch.

   Peanut butter, invented by an anonymous St.
Louis physician as a health food for invalids and later fed to
mental patients, is 99 years old this year and still going strong.
   ``We don't know his name,'' said Marilyne Moore, director of
promotions and education for the Georgia Peanut Commission. ``We
don't know how it came about, other than that he ground up peanuts
to make a health food that they could consume.''
   The process was later patented by the Kellogg family of Battle
Creek, Mich.
   ``Mom and apple pie and peanut butter are a way of life in
America,'' said Don Koehler, the commission's executive director,
noting that Americans consumed about a billion pounds of peanut
butter last year.
   ``We'd like to think that peanut butter may be pushing apple
pie.''

   Producer Allan Carr says Wednesday's Academy
Awards will be ``the best show ever.'' But despite the hype, Oscar
can easily be upstaged by the Hollywood sideshows sharing the bill
each year.
   Who's wearing what and with whom _ the evening's Five Ws _ have
been known to steal the show from the golden statuettes that come
later, as arriving celebrities ritualistically alight from their
lengthy black limos.
   On the party scene, the Academy's official Governor's Ball is
generally a staid affair and Oscar winners usually make only
obligatory appearances before heading to private parties.
   But this year, many stars will party while watching the awards
on television.
   ``It is very fashionable this year to say, `I'm not going to the
Oscars,''' said celebrity insider Susan Price, who is also a public
relations consultant for Beverly Hills hair stylist Umberto.
   Superagent Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar will throw his annual Oscar
soiree at the posh eatery Spago, with dozens of celebrities
expected to gather there to watch the awards on television. Those
expected include Jeff Bridges, Glenn Close, Joan Collins, Michael
Douglas and Jane Fonda.
   The city's No. 1 celebrity of late, former President Ronald
Reagan, turned down an invitation to Lazar's party to watch the
awards with wife, Nancy, at their Bel-Air home, said spokesman Mark
Weinberg.
   Actress Elizabeth Taylor will hold a private get-together to
watch the Oscars show, and Ernest and Tova Borgnine will cast mock
ballots with friends during a private party in their Beverly Hills
home.
   Other mockers will gather at the Palace club in Hollywood, the
scene of the Golden Raspberry Foundation's annual Oscar spoof
ceremony, which this year will be held simultaneously with the
Academy Awards.
   Guests will dine on a potluck dinner while viewing the real
Oscar show on a large-screen TV. Presentation of the plastic
``Razzie'' trophies, which honor the worst in entertainment, will
be made during commercial breaks.
   The Oscars ceremony may not be the only game in town Wednesday,
but it could be the most expensive. A complete Academy Awards
evening can range from $1,800 to $15,000 per person.
   A seat at the Shrine Auditorium ceremony costs $150, the
Governor's Ball runs $450, it's $500 for a stretch-limousine,
tuxedo rental is about $70 and designer gowns range from $1,200 to
$12,000.
   Carr, who hired designers Ray Klausen and Fred Hayman to spiff
up the Oscar show, said the awards will be big, glitzy and
nostalgic, more like a Broadway play than the annual parade to the
podium.
   ``The trend this year will be drop-dead chic entrance gowns,''
said Hayman. ``The idea this year is a return to great glamour, the
Hollywood of the past. The public looks to Hollywood for glamour.''
He promised ``a lot of wonderful beading'' on the gowns.
   Two celebrities can particularly be expected to have the look
that might make someone drop dead. Cher can usually be counted on
to expose her navel, and actress-model Edy Williams habitually
steps out of a limousine wearing not much of anything.
   Last year, Miss Williams, the libidinous super vixen in ``Beyond
the Valley of the Dolls,'' arrived with a stuffed puppie on her
shoulder and doves on her head, but her revealing costume drew more
ogling than her pets.
   She promises more of the same this year.
   ``It's going to be outrageous, and I'm in better shape, better
condition because I've been working out,'' she said. She vowed her
escort would be a pit bull named Bum Rap.

<HEAD>Smokers Find Ally in Maryland Legislature</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of watching their right to
light up slowly whittled away, smokers are about to get some relief
from the Maryland General Assembly.
   The legislature is nearing enactment of a bill that would make
it illegal for employers to refuse to hire someone because that
person is a smoker. Both the House and Senate are on record as
supporting the measure, making it likely a bill will be sent to the
governor before the legislature adjourns April 10.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer has not taken a position on the
issue.
   Bruce C. Bereano, lobbyist for The Tobacco Institute, said he
knows of no other state that has a similar law, although the
Virginia legislature voted this year to prohibit discrimination by
state and local governments against smokers.
   Identical bills introduced in the Maryland House and Senate go
much further than the Virginia law, covering all private employers
as well as public agencies. An employer could not refuse to hire or
promote a worker or fire him simply because that employee smokes
when he is not at work.
   Sponsors of the two bills say they deal with freedom and
individual rights, not smoking, dismissing the arguments of
opponents who say employers have a right to try to reduce the costs
associated with smoking.
   ``I just see this as a right that people have to perform legal
acts in their homes as long as it doesn't jeopardize their job
performance,'' Delegate George W. Owings III said Friday.
   The Maryland legislation was prompted in part by a policy
adopted a year ago by the Montgomery County fire and rescue
services. The suburban Washington, D.C., county makes new employees
sign an agreement that they will not smoke on or off duty as long
as they work for the department.
   Owings, whose district is in the tobacco growing region of
southern Maryland, said he wonders what will come next if employers
can get away with telling people they can't smoke.
   ``Will they tell you that you can't watch Channel 9? You can
only watch Channel 11 between the hours of 10 and seven? You can't
read The Baltimore Sun?
   ``What are they going to take away next?'' Owings asked.
   ``If you want to take it to the extremes, an employer, say a
tobacco company, could say, `If you want to work here, you have to
smoke,''' he said.
   Sen. Albert Wynn, sponsor of the Senate version of the bill,
said he has seen newspapers ads offering jobs only for non-smokers,
showing that the Montgomery County agency is not the only employer
to penalize smokers.
   ``This is discrimination, and it ought to be a prohibited act,''
Wynn said.
   Opponents of the bill argued in committee and during floor
debate that employers have a legitimate interest in whether their
employees smoke because smokers have more health problems,
resulting in higher health insurance costs.
   Wynn said if employers can discriminate against smokers on the
basis of higher costs, they can move on from there to discriminate
against overweight people and people with high blood pressure.

<TEXT>
   Laotians voted Sunday in the first
national election since communists seized power 13 years ago.
Officials called the balloting a step toward ``socialist
democracy'' but said it would bring no policy changes.
   Citizens of this impoverished, Southeast Asian nation chose
members of the Supreme People's Council, the highest state body.
Officials said 121 candidates, about two-thirds of them Communist
Party members, were running for the 79 seats.
   ``After the elections, there will be no political changes,''
acting President Phoumi Vongvichit told reporters at a polling
station, dismissing foreign reports of major leadership changes.
   ``Policy and direction remain unchanged,'' said Phoumi, who
turns 80 next month.
   At another polling booth, 68-year-old Premier Kaysone Phomvihane
boasted, ``The people won't let me quit. ... I am still the prime
minister.''
   Kaysone said a new government will be formed in about 18 months,
after the newly elected national council drafts Laos' first
constitution.
   Kaysone and Phoumi helped lead the decades-long communist
guerrilla struggle against French colonial rulers and then the
American-backed government during the Vietnam War. Kaysone has been
premier since December 1975, when the communists won power, and has
led the party since co-founding it in 1955.
   Hundreds of people were lined up at polling stations at schools,
temples and government offices in the capital by the time polls
opened Sunday.
   Many voters appeared confused. Some turned in unmarked ballots,
and one 70-year-old grandmother asked a foreign reporter to mark
hers. Officials said voting was not compulsory, but some citizens
said they voted because they were not convinced there would be no
penalty.
   At temples where foreign reporters were taken, many voters
marked their ballots in open view. Many said they knew nothing
about the candidates.
   The council comprised 45 appointed officials when it was
established in 1975.
   Among Laos' 3.8 million people, about 1.8 million aged 18 years
or older were eligible to vote. Results from the 4,153 polling
stations were to be counted by hand, which could take a week to 10
days.
   When polling ended in the evening, 10 officials at one polling
station sat in a ring and turned a ballot box upside down and
dumped ballots on straw mats. They marked the tally on a chalk
board. Turnout at the station was more than 98 percent, they said.
   Kaysone said the polling was ``very important. The election
enlarges people's democracy in a genuine way and encourages debate
on who wants whom in the Supreme People's Council: who is good, who
has the qualifications.''
   But some foreign analysts called it mainly an attempt to
convince the world Laos was stable and an attractive country for
foreign investment, trade and aid.
   Sirichai Sirikai, a political scientist in neighboring Thailand,
said candidates were selected by authorities and there were no
alternative political parties.
   The landlocked state is one of the world's poorest, with an
average individual income estimated at $135 a year. In late 1986,
the party endorsed Western-style economic reforms to try to reverse
a decade of socialist policies.
   The first nationwide district and provincial elections were held
last year.

<TEXT>
   Shortly after sunrise Sunday, about 30
members of the dwindling Western community gathered for an Easter
service at the Italian Embassy, where the only remaining occupants
are a priest and three dogs.
   As rain poured down outside, turning Kabul into a morass of
brown-gray mud, the Rev. Angelo Panigati played a small, table-top
organ and led worshipers through three choruses of ``Christ the
Lord is Risen Today.''
   The congregation of Catholics and Protestants vividly
illustrated the effect of international politics.
   No diplomats were present, only aid workers and some military
men from the United Nations.
   The United States and 11 other countries evacuated their
diplomats two months ago during the final phase of the
now-completed Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Some of those who most wanted the Red Army to leave were the
ones who closed their embassies, professing fears security would
deteriorate rapidly when there were no longer Soviet soldiers in
the streets.
   The United Nations, which sponsored the Geneva accord that led
to the Soviet withdrawal, now is reduced to 23 foreign staffers,
one-fifth the number here eight months ago.
   Easter Sunday's congregation at the barricaded embassy, where
the Italian flag still flies but no business is conducted, was a
representative sample of the fluctuating Western community that
rarely exceeds 150.
   The Roman Catholic Panigati, an Italian citizen who spent the
last 24 years in Kabul teaching Afghan students and ministering to
foreign Christians, does not want to leave.
   ``This is my parish,'' he said, gesturing at worshipers.
   They included Irish and Fijian colonels from the U.N. force
established for the Soviet withdrawal, German nuns and laymen who
nurse in Kabul hospitals, Swiss from the International Committee of
the Red Cross, a Canadian Mennonite who stayed behind to help run
an eye hospital after most of his associates were withdrawn by the
International Assistance Missions, a Protestant aid organization.
   The Afghan government, trying hard but largely without success
to distance itself from its communist coup-installed origins in
1979 and the accompanying political killings, imprisonments and
torture, has harshly attacked the West for leaving Kabul.
   President Najib, a former secret police chief who took power in
1986, says he is ready to share power with the Moslem guerrillas.
   A Foreign Ministry statement Wednesday appealed to the United
States and other nations to reopen their embassies.
   President Najib's government repeatedly has denounced the
embassy closures as a propaganda ploy to destabilize his government
and boost morale of the U.S.-supported guerrillas, who have waged a
decade-old war against the regime.
   The government observes that a bloodbath has not occurred in
Kabul since the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15. Since
then, days and even weeks have passed without guerrilla rockets
landing in Kabul, compared to the 20 or 30 rockets that were
landing in the capital daily last fall.
   But the war is far from over, as evinced by new fortifications
in Kabul, the Soviet planes that bring missiles and ammunition as
well as food, and the 20-day battle for the eastern city of
Jalalabad, where the government's unverified figures say more than
2,100 people have been killed.
   But war's fears were set aside for a few minutes Easter morning
as Panigati read the story of Christ's resurrection from the Gospel
of Mark and a brown-and-white dog, a refugee from the now-shuttered
French Embassy, chased its tail.
   At the end of the half-hour service, the priest noted that the
work of a few Christians in this war-devastated nation still can
produce good results and he wished for ``peace for the beloved
Afghan people.''
   The last hymn of the Easter service was entitled ``The Strife is
Over.''

<HEAD>Investigators Narrowing Search In Chilean Grapes Poisoning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Food and Drug Administration
said Sunday that investigators have narrowed the search for those
responsible for injecting cyanide in two grapes imported from Chile.
   While offering no indication that officials necessarily expect
to make an arrest, FDA Commissioner Frank Young said the incident _
which prompted the removal from U.S. grocery shelves of all produce
from Chile _ could result in prosecution under U.S. laws.
   ``We don't have the exact person who would have done it, but we
do have a lot of information and we can trace back with a paper
trail to the small producer where this particular crop came from,''
Young said on the NBC television program ``Meet the Press.''
   ``We do not know who did it, but the person ... would come under
the U.S. laws of tampering ... and tampering is subject to multiple
years in jail and major, tens of thousands of dollars of fines,''
said Young.
   He also defended government action in removing Chilean products
from the U.S. market for several days while intensified inspection
techniques were worked out with Chilean officials and acknowledged
that there will never be a 100 percent guarantee against such
tampering in the future.
   Young said it is crucial for individual consumers to play a
large role in insuring their own safety by inspecting the fruits
and vegatables they eat.
   ``When you look at it, the (U.S.) government does one part, the
exporting country does another part, the consumers do a third
part,'' said Young.
   Is visual inspection by a consumer really an effective way to
reduce risk?
   ``Yes, it is,'' Young replied. ``In the case of fruit, you
should be able to, if it is injected in, see the needle site and
see the particular softening at that point. It's also important
that in the large fruits, like apples, to look at the stem and
blossom areas.''
   Young, who also headed FDA during the cyanide poisoning of
over-the-counter pain medication in Chicago several years ago, said
there are almost always visible signs of tampering.
   ``What I was impressed with is, when we looked at all of the
tampering that we've gone through, that even with medicines, when
capsules were involved, any consumer that had looked at the dosage
form would have seen that the capsule was tampered with,'' said
Young.
   He denied any suggestion that his call for increased consumer
awareness amounted to the agency shirking responsibility.
   ``I'd say that we have with the resources at hand moved these to
meet a variety of crises and we can do that quite well,'' said
Young. ``On the other hand, we cannot do 100 percent safety. In the
case of this inspection, we had to do a random sampling that we
then, with a probability, a statistical probability, say that we've
got the maximum feasible safety that can be done through
inspection.''

<HEAD>Former `Whiz Kid' Faces Sentencing On 57-Count Conviction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three months after he was convicted of 57
counts of securities, credit card and mail fraud, a man once
considered a teen-age business genius returns to court Monday to be
sentenced.
   A prosecution sentencing memorandum asked for a sentence of at
least 25 years behind bars for Barry Minkow, saying such a term was
``more than justified'' for the 22-year-old man.
   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian could sentence Minkow to
up to 300 years. But defense attorney David Kenner has said that is
unlikely, and was expected to argue for a much shorter term than
the government recommendation.
   ``Barry is a young man ...,'' Kenner said after his client was
convicted. ``I would hope Barry will still be a young man when he
is released.''
   Minkow, who was 16 when he launched his ZZZZ Best carpet
cleaning company in his parents' garage, has insisted he was a
captive of mobsters who took over his company and forced him to
commit fraud.
   The government claimed he was a shrewd con man who convinced
Wall Street investors and TV talk show hosts that he was a business
genius.
   ``He sold investors on a business which, for the most part, did
not exist,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger who said
Minkow's manipulations cost investors over $25 million.
   The collapse of ZZZZ Best rocked the volatile U.S. money markets
and exposed the vulnerability of major securities firms and banks
which bought Minkow's sales pitch and committed millions to his
company.
   The keystone of Minkow's scheme, devised with a number of
associates, was a claim that ZZZZ Best was making a fortune
restoring water- and fire-damaged buildings. Investors were taken
on tours of alleged restoration projects in abandoned buildings
with which ZZZZ Best had no connection.
   At the height of his fame, Minkow lived in a $1 million house
and drove a Ferrari. But he claimed he actually was living a
nightmare of fear as gangsters moved in on his empire.
   ``I was just a front man for the mob,'' he testified at his
trial. ``I was just a puppet.''
   It became clear at the trial that Minkow had dealings with such
mob figures as the late Jack Catain. The defense presented evidence
that Los Angeles police had investigated mob infiltration of ZZZZ
Best. But the judge limited such testimony and jurors rejected the
claim that Minkow was a hostage of the mob.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortly after sunrise Sunday, about 30
members of the dwindling Western community gathered for an Easter
service at the Italian Embassy, where the only remaining occupants
are a priest and three dogs.
   As rain poured down outside, turning Kabul into a morass of
brown-gray mud, the Rev. Angelo Panigati played a small, table-top
organ and led worshipers through three choruses of ``Christ the
Lord is Risen Today.''
   The congregation of Catholics and Protestants vividly
illustrated the effect of international politics.
   No diplomats were present, only aid workers and some military
men from the United Nations.
   The United States and 11 other countries evacuated their
diplomats two months ago during the final phase of the
now-completed Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Some of those who most wanted the Red Army to leave were the
ones who closed their embassies, professing fears security would
deteriorate rapidly when there were no longer Soviet soldiers in
the streets.
   The United Nations, which sponsored the Geneva accord that led
to the Soviet withdrawal, now is reduced to 23 foreign staffers,
one-fifth the number here eight months ago.
   Easter Sunday's congregation at the barricaded embassy, where
the Italian flag still flies but no business is conducted, was a
representative sample of the fluctuating Western community that
rarely exceeds 150.
   The Roman Catholic Panigati, an Italian citizen who spent the
last 24 years in Kabul teaching Afghan students and ministering to
foreign Christians, does not want to leave.
   ``This is my parish,'' he said, gesturing at worshipers.
   They included Irish and Fijian colonels from the U.N. force
established for the Soviet withdrawal, German nuns and laymen who
nurse in Kabul hospitals, Swiss from the International Committee of
the Red Cross, a Canadian Mennonite who stayed behind to help run
an eye hospital after most of his associates were withdrawn by the
International Assistance Missions, a Protestant aid organization.
   The Afghan government, trying hard but largely without success
to distance itself from its communist coup-installed origins in
1979 and the accompanying political killings, imprisonments and
torture, has harshly attacked the West for leaving Kabul.
   President Najib, a former secret police chief who took power in
1986, says he is ready to share power with the Moslem guerrillas.
   A Foreign Ministry statement Wednesday appealed to the United
States and other nations to reopen their embassies.
   President Najib's government repeatedly has denounced the
embassy closures as a propaganda ploy to destabilize his government
and boost morale of the U.S.-supported guerrillas, who have waged a
decade-old war against the regime.
   The government observes that a bloodbath has not occurred in
Kabul since the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15. Since
then, days and even weeks have passed without guerrilla rockets
landing in Kabul, compared to the 20 or 30 rockets that were
landing in the capital daily last fall.
   But the war is far from over, as evinced by new fortifications
in Kabul, the Soviet planes that bring missiles and ammunition as
well as food, and the 20-day battle for the eastern city of
Jalalabad, where the government's unverified figures say more than
2,100 people have been killed.
   But war's fears were set aside for a few minutes Easter morning
as Panigati read the story of Christ's resurrection from the Gospel
of Mark and a brown-and-white dog, a refugee from the now-shuttered
French Embassy, chased its tail.
   At the end of the half-hour service, the priest noted that the
work of a few Christians in this war-devastated nation still can
produce good results and he wished for ``peace for the beloved
Afghan people.''
   The last hymn of the Easter service was entitled ``The Strife is
Over.''

   Moslem guerrillas bombarded Jalalabad
with rockets and artillery shells Sunday, and government forces
retaliated with heavy air and ground attacks, the Foreign Ministry
said.
   A spokesman for the communist government said 248 guerrillas, 12
civilians and 3 soldiers were killed in the past 24 hours around
Jalalabad. He said 55 others were wounded and 12 houses were
destroyed.
   The official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan said
``after a shameful defeat'' U.S.-backed rebels fled their positions
around the city.
   But the guerrilla-controlled Afghan News Agency, also monitored
in Islamabad, said insurgents were successfully attacking posts
flanking the embattled city to the north and south. Rebels reported
no death toll after Sunday fighting.
   There was no independent confirmation of either report.
   The government also said the rebels killed at least 50 people in
attacks on four civilian buses elsewhere in the country on Saturday
and Sunday.
   The last Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan Feb. 15, ending
a nine-year intervention.
   Soon after, the Moslem guerrillas established an Afghan
government-in-exile in Pakistan and focused the fighting on
Jalalabad, located 75 miles east of the capital.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Nabi Amani, told
reporters the guerrillas pounded civilian and military areas of
Jalalabad with 12,000 rockets and shells between Saturday and late
Sunday.
   Jalalabad had a pre-war population of about 200,000 a decade
ago. With many people fleeing the war to neighboring Pakistan or to
other parts of Afghanistan, the population now is thought to be
less than 100,000.
   Amani said government artillery and warplanes attacked the
rebels at Chaparhar and Karizi Kbir, both west of Jalalabad, and at
Surkhrod to the east.
   He also said a large number of weapons were destroyed, including
six multiple rocket-launchers, three arms and ammunition depots and
two tanks.
   Amani also said the guerrillas blew up two mini-buses carrying
civilians on Sunday. He said he did not know how many people were
aboard the buses.
   He said one attack occurred on the road connecting Kabul with
the northeast province of Laghman. The other, he said, occurred on
the Jalalabad-Kabul highway.
   He also said the guerrillas detonated land mines that killed 10
people on two other buses in the past 24 hours. He said one attack
occurred at Islam Qala near the Iranian border, while the other
happened at Sayed Karem in Paktia province, which borders Pakistan.
   In Kabul, where basic foods have grown scarcer and more
expensive because of guerrilla attacks on roads leading to the city
and an exceptionally harsh winter, a small-scale free-food
distribution program was resumed by the United Nations on Sunday.
   In Khair Khanna, one of the city's poorer districts, 600 women
and children were given 22 pounds of flour and 6.6 Pounds of sugar
each.
   The U.N. program has targeted 30,000 people _ mostly pregnant
women, nursing mothers, children and lepers _ for its food
distribution program.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher leaves for Africa
Monday on a tour aides describe as a diplomatic push to launch a
peace initiative in southern Africa, including a political
settlement in South Africa.
   The weeklong trip to Morocco, Zimbabwe and Malawi, with a
stopover in Nigeria, underlines Mrs. Thatcher's transformation from
being in the mid-1980s the focus of African resentment over what
black states see as Western foot-dragging over South African
apartheid.
   ``This is the beginning of an initiative,'' said a senior
British government source, speaking on condition on anonymity.
``But how far it will go is anybody's guess at the moment.''
   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, once an outspoken critic of
Mrs. Thatcher for her refusal to impose tough sanctions against
South Africa, is planning a warm welcome for the British
Conservative Party leader.
   It is her first visit to the former white-ruled Rhodesia, which
Britain steered to independence in 1980, and to Malawi, another
ex-colony.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, who held a surprise
meeting with Mrs. Thatcher at her invitation in London on March 15,
indicated before the trip that she could play a pivotal role in
southern Africa.
   Con Botha, a spokesman for South Africa's governing National
Party, said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview that
South Africans have ``the highest regard'' for Mrs. Thatcher's
anti-sanctions stance.
   ``We also think she is in a particularly good position to
influence African states she is going to visit now to adopt a more
pragmatic attitude toward developments in southern Africa,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher may try to build on recent agreements under which
Soviet-supported Cuban troops will withdraw from Angola and
U.N.-supervised elections will bring independence to Namibia.
   In Zimbabwe, Mugabe will likely reiterate demands for Britain to
impose tough embargoes against South Africa, a major trading
partner.
   Talks in Zimbabwe and Malawi are expected to focus on new moves
to end the civil war waged in neighboring Mozambique by Renamo
rebels and on the implementation of the Namibian peace settlement.
   Mrs. Thatcher denied published reports she plans to organize a
southern African regional peace conference, but said Britain will
help if asked.

   French-born Jack Pointeau did it right,
which was wrong.
   He entered this country legally, so he must leave. Had he
entered the country illegally, he could stay. Now it is too late to
become an illegal alien and stay. So he really is an illegal alien
and must go.
   Don't laugh. Jack's not. Nor are his wife and four children. Or
their friends. Or the townspeople.
   ``This is a Catch-22 bureaucratic boondoggle,'' said Donny
Brown, editor of the Snyder Daily News.
   Some call it the French Fiasco.
   After selling their small, three-star hotel in Paris, the
vacationing Pointeaus entered the United States in 1981 on tourist
visas. They liked what they found. In 1982, they obtained an
investor's visa and bought a motel in the San Franciso area.
   When his night clerk was slain, Pointeau sold the motel and
moved his family to this West Texas oil town of 12,000. The
Pointeaus purchased a 50 percent interest in a motel for $212,000.
Pointeau's wife, Francoise, and the couple's four daughters became
honor students in school. Pointeau joined the Rotary Club.
   Now, the family must sell or surrender their motel and pack up
their possessions. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
in the fall told Pointeau, 52, that the family will be deported by
April 26.
   INS officials pointed to a series of alleged shortcomings but
the most critical seemed to be that Pointeau's investment was not
``substantial'' and that his enterprise was marginal.
   ``The regulations do not define what is substantial,'' the INS
conceded, but the agency noted that some consular offices use
$250,000 as a ``point of departure.''
   Pointeau said he appealed to the Lubbock immigration office for
help but was told, ``There is nothing we can do for you because you
are legal.''
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, a Texas Democrat, introduced legislation
designed to rescue the family but got only a polite rebuff and a
concession that immigration laws need changing.
   Referring to the recent pardon for many illegal aliens, Stenholm
aide Marc Lubin said: ``What's ironic about this is that if he had
not been here legally, if he had not renewed his visa each time, he
would have been granted amnesty.''
   Attorneys say the Pointeau affair may not be all that uncommon
in the wake of a recent get-tough edict by immigration officials.
   In September, a petition circulated in Snyder protesting the INS
action picked up 1,837 signatures. Earlier this month, a citizens
group pledged $3,000 to retain an attorney and pay filing fees for
a lawsuit to delay deportation.
   ``Now I know what is the spirit of Texas,'' Pointeau said last
week in his disjointed English, which he speaks with a lilting
French accent.
   When Pointeau headed for Snyder and bought a stake in the motel,
the town was riding the crest of an oil boom. Even after the boom
went bust, Pointeau dutifully renewed his investor's visa each year
and kept his motel afloat with hard work and modestly successful
outside business ventures.
   Meanwhile, the four children, who now range in age from 13 to
21, were excelling at school.
   So was Mrs. Pointeau, who graduated with high honors from a
nearby college and is on the verge of obtaining a master's degree
in French literature. ``She will not be able to graduate if we have
to leave,'' Pointeau said.
   ``Year after year, it became fact that we all were living in
America and that the children were receiving an eduation for a
future life in this country,'' Pointeau said. ``After having lived
here for years, we all started dreaming about becoming U.S.
citizens.
   ``Easy to say, tough to accomplish.''
   After years of temporary visa renewals, the immigration office
in Dallas notified Pointeau that another extension was being denied.
   Friends believe Pointeau can buy more time with the federal
lawsuit.
   ``We won't let this die,'' said restaurant owner Randy Perkins.
``This is a great cause to fight for.''

   Three-year-old Sasha's parents leaned down and
asked the young Muscovite attired in a snowsuit who is his favorite
candidate. ``Yeltsin!'' their son exclaimed.
   Most adults voting at Moscow polling station No. 74 were as
definite about their choice, and optimistic about what Sunday's
multicandidate elections mean. ``I think the quality of our leaders
will improve because now we have a real democracy,'' said Dr.
Valentina Agababova as she sat on a windowsill and crossed out
names of candidates she was voting against. Previously the
Communist Party allowed only one candidate for each seat.
   ``Once upon a time, we'd just take the forms and throw them into
the ballot box. Now, for the first time, we're really voting,'' she
said.
   The choice for the Moscow city seat between maverick communist
Boris N. Yeltsin and his opponent, automobile factory director
Yevgeny Brakov, seemed clear-cut: Of 50 voters interviewed around
Moscow on Sunday, 42 said they voted for Yeltsin _ ``naturally,''
said one. Only two said they chose Brakov.
   But at polling station No. 74 in southern Moscow, a separate
district race slowed the process.
   A small line formed before red-curtained voting booths and
voters decided between a dozen candidates for the new Congress of
People's Deputies, including a television commentator, a professor
of philosophy, a renowned military historian and a cosmonaut.
   Candidates have wooed voters over the past two months through
election meetings and television appearances. As Soviets made their
choice, the state media went into high gear. But they offered bland
fare by U.S. standards, lacking the pizazz of high-tech U.S.
network coverage. Absent were early returns from the Soviet Far
East, where the polls closed two hours after polls opened in
Moscow. Complete election results are not expected until April 5.
   Many Soviets, however, said television was indispensable in
helping them make their choices.
   ``I decided who to vote for in my local election as a result of
the televised debates. My choice seemed more intelligent and had a
more pleasing face; I guess it's the same reason many Americans
voted for Reagan,'' said a 37-year-old Moscow woman who declined to
give her name.
   In the televised ``debates,'' as they were called, candidates
gave speeches or answered reporters' questions. They seldom engaged
in exchanges with their rivals.
   A poll published Saturday showed 38 percent of 2,000 respondents
to a questionnaire in Moskovskaya Pravda newspaper criticized the
media for lack of depth.
   Poll results published Saturday by the newspaper left out what
Westerners would consider the main question: Which candidate will
you vote for?
   The newspaper said 85 percent of respondents did want to give
their choice. ``But it would have been tactless to assess the
chances of candidates a day before the election,'' the Communist
Party newspaper said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Moist air from the Gulf of Mexico fueled thunderstorms Sunday in
the south-central part of the nation and showers on the Plains, and
parts of Arizona got heavy snow or rain.
   Southerly wind brought mild temperatures into much of the
eastern two-thirds of the nation. Fort Wayne, Ind., tied its record
of 75 degrees and Ottumway, Iowa, tied its record of 78. Dodge
City, Kan., hit a non-record 85 degrees.
   Thunderstorms over much of Louisiana and southeastern Texas
produced pea- to marble-size hail at Longview and Talco, Texas, and
Lake Charles, La.
   Wind gusted to 36 mph during a thunderstorm in sections of San
Antonio, Texas, and lightning destroyed a house and damaged another
one in the town of Center, in eastern Texas, the National Weather
Service said.
   Scattered showers extended over eastern Kansas and northern
Missouri. Dodge City, Kan., also had wind gusts to 51 mph.
   Elsewhere, an upper level storm system over southern California
produced showers in sections of the Southwest.
   In Arizona, Phoenix received 1.05 inches of rain during the 24
hours up to 11 a.m. MST. Fountain Hills, Payson and Prescott all
received around 1 1-3 inches of rain during the 24 hours up to 8
a.m. MST.
   Higher elevations of Arizona received heavy snow, including 9
inches overnight at Flagstaff. Light afternoon snow was reported at
Butte, Mont., and Sun Valley, Idaho.
   Afternoon temperatures were in the 70s as far north as the
mid-Atlantic Coast states, the Ohio Valley and the Chicago area,
with some readings in the lower 80s in the Carolinas.
   In contrast, dense fog and temperatures in the 40s prevailed in
northern sections of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota and in North
Dakota.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 34
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 87 at Harlingen, Texas. Sunday's
early-morning low in the Lower 48 states was 14 degrees at Truckee,
Calif.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
across much of the great Plains and Mississippi Valley, and will be
most numerous from Texas across Oklahoma to the middle Mississippi
Valley. Showers were forecast in sections of Arizona and New
Mexico. Widespread rain was forecast in the Pacific Northwest, with
showers extending into Idaho and Montana.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted in North Dakota and sections of
Montana; in the 50s in Maine, northern Michigan and northern
Minnesota, and from the Pacific Northwest to the Rockies; in the
80s in sections of the central Plains, from southern Texas across
the Gulf Coast states to the southern Atlantic Coast states, in
sections of the Tennessee Valley and the southern Appalachians; and
in the 60s and 70s across much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Iran's navy hijacked an Arab tycoon's
yacht with five members of Kuwait's royal family and four Britons
aboard and was holding them for ransom, news reports said Sunday.
   Government information officers in Kuwait, Bahrain and other
gulf states said that they had no information about the incident,
which reportedly occurred Thursday.
   Independent Television News in Britain quoted diplomatic sources
in Kuwait as saying the four Britons are young women who were
aboard the 82-foot yacht, owned by Kuwait's al-Sabah royal family.
   The report said the yacht apparently was seized for ransom after
it strayed into a sensitive area near Iran's northern Farsi island.
   It said officials leaked information to the Kuwaiti newspaper
Al-Anbaa because Iran's Revolutionary Guards are demanding a ransom
and negotiations between Kuwait and Iran are going badly.
   Al-Anbaa first reported the story, saying the yacht had come
from France and docked briefly at Bahrain, before leaving Thursday.
Six hours after it sailed for Kuwait, a distress signal was picked
up, said the paper.
   Officials at Bahrain's leading yacht club, the Marina Club, said
their registers showed a distress signal issued Thursday.
   A man speaking English with an Arabic accent said, ``My yacht is
burning. What can I do?'' according to a club official. The caller
did not respond to a request for his location.
   Al-Anbaa identified those aboard the yacht only as royal family
members from an unidentified Persian Gulf nation and four Britons.
The newspaper said it had names of all those aboard but would not
publish them ``to avoid affecting the secret contacts going on with
Iran at the highest levels to end the incident.''
   In London, Britain's foreign office said it was the first it had
heard of the report. ``We've asked our embassies in the region but
they know nothing about it,'' said a spokesman on condition of
anonymity.
   Shipping executives speaking on condition of anonymity said
there were at least two cases in recent months of ``pirates''
seizing vessels in the northern gulf.
   ``They just turn over people aboard to the nearest fishing boat
and seize the boat,'' said one of the sources.
   The pirates most likely are Iranian, the sources said.
   Al-Anbaa said the yacht probably is at Farsi.
   The island was used as a base for gunboats manned by
Revolutionary Guards during the 8-year gulf war. The gunboats were
used to attack oil tankers and other merchant traffic in gulf
shipping lanes.
   Kuwait was one of Iraq's largest financial backers during the
war and registered 11 tankers in the United States because Iran
made its shipping a target. This prompted a large U.S. Navy buildup
in the gulf. Iran says the U.S. Navy presence was one of the
military setbacks that forced it to accept the Aug. 20 cease-fire
ending the war.
   Kuwait-Iranian relations had been improving since the
cease-fire. But friction surfaced March 15, when Kuwait said a
number of fugitives its government wants on charges ranging from
espionage to coup plotting were free in Iran.
   A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Kuwait said: ``We have no
information yet. We read the report like you in the newspaper.''

<HEAD>Government Mobilizes Thousands of Police To Halt Protests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government deployed thousands of
riot troops throughout Seoul Sunday in a crackdown on radical
groups to end anti-government demonstrations. Students clashed with
troops in two southern cities.
   Riot squads were posted outside important government buildings
in Seoul and at some major intersections.
   Police declined to say how many troops were deployed, but about
700 riot police in 18 buses were posted at the U.S. Embassy Sunday.
   Roh last week ordered security forces to take tough measures to
halt a wave of protests and break up radical organizations he said
were trying to stage a violent revolution. Radicals have called for
the resignation of Roh, who they say is not committed to genuine
democracy.
   No incidents were reported in Seoul, but radical students
clashed with riot police in the southern provincial cities of
Chonju and Kwangju, according to Yonhap, the national news agency.
   In Chonju, police battled about 600 protesters who hurled
firebombs and rocks after they were blocked from marching out of
Chonbuk University, Yonhap said. In Kwangju, several hundred
students battled police after police stopped them from leaving
Chonam University to support strikers at a shipyard, the report
said.
   About 1,000 dissidents and radical students took part in a
peaceful rally at Korea University in western Seoul to demand Roh's
immediate resignation. Dissident leaders denounced Roh and accused
him of attempting to impose military rule.
   ``We call for the resignation of the Roh Tae-woo regime which
cannot carry out democratic reforms and does not represent the
nation,'' said a declaration by the United National Democratic
Movement, South Korea's main dissident alliance.
   About 2,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and visored
helmets were posted in sidestreets around the campus. The
protesters dispersed peacefully.
   Yonhap also reported that police arrested about 600 students
late Saturday after a violent protest earlier in the day at Yonsei
University in east Seoul. National Police Headquarters said it
could not confirm the report.
   Roh announced March 20 he was indefinitely postponing a promised
referendum on his performance because of disputes over how to hold
the vote and violent protests by radicals.
   The former general called the radicals a threat to political
stability and said they were attempting to stage a leftist
revolution.
   Radicals have mounted a series of violent anti-government
protests, mainly on college campuses, to call for Roh's removal.
But they lack public support because most South Koreans reject
their violent tactics, and are not seen as a serious threat to the
government's hold on power.
   It was not clear if Roh could win a referendum even though his
government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms. Many
South Koreans are critical of Roh for his ties to his former ally
and authoritarian predecessor, former president Chun Doo-hwan.

   Country store owner Belva Rowe runs her
business on the ``honor system'' _ customers help themselves to the
cash register. They don't take her money, just change for their
purchases if she's not around.
   They also make sandwiches, pump gas and dip for their own
minnows at Rowe's Bait Shop &amp; Grocery.
   ``I trust everyone,'' says Mrs. Rowe, 53. ``You know, my son
says that's my biggest downfall.''
   She opens the store about 6:30 a.m., 30 minutes after an
automatic timer makes the first pot of coffee for familiar faces,
mostly coal miners, farmers and sportsmen.
   Cash for coffee is optional.
   ``There's a donation (can) back there,'' says Mrs. Rowe. ``If
they want to donate they can, if they don't want to, they don't. I
don't pay attention to it.''
   About $8 in bills and coins lies on the counter next to the cash
register and folks walk in and out intermittently while Mrs. Rowe
entertains a visitor.
   She links her business style to her Christian religious
background. ``I don't guess we've ever had anything stolen or
ripped off, that I know of,'' she said. ``This is a really special
place.''
   The store, outside this Southern Illinois town of 400, has been
in the family for 41 years. Mrs. Rowe bought it from her in-laws 15
years ago this week.
   A father and son walk in, grab a soda and order a bologna and
cheese sandwich.
   ``What time do you open?'' says the man.
   ``Six-thirty.''
   ``OK,'' the man says, giving it some thought.
   ``But if I'm not here,'' Mrs. Rowe offers, ``you take (the
minnows) and drop the money on the way back. We operate on the
honor system around here.''
   The store, in the shadow of a grain silo, is also a gossip shop,
a bus stop, a drop-off point, ``whatever,'' says Mrs. Rowe.
Customers, she says, ``talk about fishing, the local divorces.''
   ``They'll come in, and say, `What do you know? What did you find
out last night? Any local gossip?'''
   Closing time is around 6 p.m., but Mrs. Rowe still has about
five hours before bedtime.
   Nightly, she and her husband, Dick _ both motorcycle fanatics _
meet a group of friends at a nearby truck stop for rides to St.
Louis, Paducah, Ky., or Evansville, Ind.
   ``We'll drive a hundred miles just to get a piece of pie, a
cinnamon roll, a cup of coffee,'' says Mrs. Rowe. ``Rain or shine,
it doesn't make any difference.''

<HEAD>Police Clash with Ethnic Albanians for Fourth Day</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 ethnic Albanians jeered
and threw stones at police in southern Kosovo province Sunday,
Tanjug said. It was the fourth straight day of protests of
constitutional changes they say limit their autonomy.
   The state news agency did not say if there were casualties or
gunfire, both reported in protests Saturday.
   The crowd, gathered outside the Communist Party headquarters,
shouted ``we will give our lives but not the constitution!'' as
truckloads of police approached, Tanjug said. They then scattered
into side streets, hurling bricks and rocks at police, the agency
said.
   Protesters shouted for police to ``set our comrades free,''
Tanjug said.
   The agency said 146 demonstrators were arrested in the past four
days. Most were convicted of ``petty crime'' and immediately
sentenced to up to 60 days in jail.
   Police patrolled the streets of Pristina, the provincial
capital, and Belgrade television showed police checking identity
papers and inspecting cars.
   Fifteen miles away, in the town of Urosevac, the focus of the
past three days of riots, a small group gathered Sunday but was
dispersed by police.
   Ethnic Albanians are protesting the provincial parliament's
approval Thursday of constitutional amendments giving leaders from
the mainly Christian republic of Serbia more power in Kosovo.
   The ammendments go into effect Tuesday after approval by the
parliament in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics.
They give Serbia more power over police and judicial authorities
and allow Serbia to pass amendments affecting Kosovo without
approval of the provincial parliament.
   Serbia's provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina have enjoyed
considerable autonomy since 1974, but leaders of mainly Christian
Serbia said they needed more control over Kosovo to protect the
Serbian minority from the mainly Moslem ethnic Albanians, who make
up 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million population.
   In an editorial carried by the Albanian state news agency ATA
monitored in Vienna, the Communist Party daily, Zeri I Popullit
condemned the constitutional changes as ``anti-democratic.''
   On Saturday, rioters reportedly shot at police, who used
truncheons and tear gas to disperse more than 3,000 protesters.
Ethnic Albanians also threw stones and bricks at police, broke the
windows of a train at the local station and overturned three cars.
   According to Tanjug, 24 policemen were injured in the three days
of Urosevac riots, two seriously, though it was not known if any
was wounded by gunfire. It was not known how many demonstrators
were hurt, but Tanjug said none had sought medical help at the
local health center.
   The demonstrations rioting goes against a government ban on
public gatherings imposed after protests last month.

   A single-engine plane crashed during
rough weather in Pittsfield State Forest, killing all four people
aboard, authorities said Sunday.
   The four-seat Socata TB-10 aircraft, made by the Italian-French
consortium Aerospatiale, was based at Hanscom Field in Bedford. It
was en route to Albany, N.Y., when it crashed in a light drizzle,
according to Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Michael
Ciccarelli.
   The pilot radioed that he was encountering heavy turbulence
shortly before the plane disappeared from radar late Saturday,
authorities said.
   State Trooper Christopher Ware said the four victims were all
from eastern Massachusetts. They were not identified pending
notification of next of kin.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight British and Australian members of
the United Nations peacekeeping forces here brawled with 20 South
Africans following a rugby match, a U.N. spokesman said Sunday.
   One British soldier suffered a broken jaw, said Fred Eckhard, a
spokesman for the U.N. forces, which are to monitor Namibia's
transition to independence. The other U.N. soldiers suffered minor
injuries, he said.
   Eckhard said the troops were spectators at a rugby match
Saturday between a South African team and a Namibian squad in the
town of Tsumeb, about 300 miles north of Windhoek.
   The fight erupted after the game outside a nearby clubhouse when
five South Africans attacked an Australian, Eckhard said. The other
South Africans and soldiers then joined in, he said.
   Eckhard said he did not know what led to the fight or who the
South African were.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the
fight was believed to have involved white supporters of the local
rugby team who object to the presence of U.N. troops in Namibia.
   Eckhard declined to identify the U.N. soldiers, who were not in
uniform at the time of the fight. Local police and U.N. officials
were investigating, he said.
   The commander of the British forces in Namibia has confined his
troops to their base because of the brawl, Eckhard said.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since World War I, on
Saturday is to begin implementing the territory's transition to
independence. Elections are to be held in November.
   A total of 4,650 U.N. troops from more than 20 countries are to
monitor the independence process in Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa.

<HEAD>Baby Involved In Publicized Custody Battle Turns 3</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baby M, the New Jersey baby involved in a
much-publicized custody fight that prompted national interest in
surrogate motherhood, turns 3 years old on Monday.
   Her natural mother, Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, had agreed to be
artificially inseminated and then give the child to the natural
father, but reneged on the deal after the baby was born.
   The girl, now known as Melissa Stern, now lives with her father
and his wife, William and Elizabeth Stern of Tenafly.
   ``I'm not at liberty to discuss'' where Melissa will celebrate
her birthday, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said in a telephone interview
Sunday from her home in Bayport, N.Y.
   When she agreed under a $10,000 contract to bear the child, she
was a Brick Township housewife, married to Richard Whitehead. She
rejected the money and sought custody of the child.
   In 1987, a lower court judge stripped her of all parental
rights, in a case in which the baby was referred to Baby M. But the
state Supreme Court restored parental and visitation rights to Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould and outlawed surrogacy for pay in New Jersey.
   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported that Melissa would spend the
weekend with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and return to Tenafly on Monday.
   A judge ruled in a visitation order last year that the child
could spend birthdays with the Sterns because she is being raised
in their home and ``children normally have birthday parties with
their friends.''
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has since divorced Whitehead and remarried,
and has become a campaigner against surrogacy. The Sterns
continually decline to be interviewed.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said Sunday that she planned to leave
Monday for the last two weeks of a 22-city tour to promote the book
she co-wrote about the custody fight.

<TEXT>
   Christians emerged from underground
shelters Sunday to celebrate Easter in Beirut and its suburbs but
returned after a 12-hour lull in artillery battles ended at
nightfall.
   Syrian troops and allied Druse militiamen pounded east Beirut
and the Christian-held region north of the city with multibarreled
rocket launchers Sunday night, police said.
   Christian army gunners in hills above the capital struck back
with 155mm howitzer barrages, targeting residential neighborhoods
where they claim the Syrians set up rocket-launching batteries.
   Police said two people were killed and 12 wounded in Sunday's
bombardments, which were separated by a 12-hour daytime lull. That
raised the overall toll to 94 killed and 326 wounded since the
latest fighting broke out March 8.
   Residents on both sides of Beirut's dividing Green Line scurried
back to basements and bomb shelters for a fourth straight night as
the thunderous bombardment intensified.
   ``This is Lebanon's brand of Easter fireworks, deadly
fireworks,'' said Nada Akiki, a Christian housewife reached at her
home near the U.S. Embassy compound.
   Police said the power plant feeding Beirut from a Christian
suburb was burning after taking several direct hits. Authorities
started rationing residents to four hours' power a day.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, 53, the Christian army chief who also leads
the Christian cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, accused Syrian
gunners of trying to assassinate him after police reported his
residential palace and Defense Ministry headquarters took at least
1,000 hits overnight Saturday.
   Another 4,000 rounds struck other Christian suburbs, said police.
   They said 1,500 Christian shells struck Beirut's Shiite Moslem
southern slum, Druse-held towns along the Beirut-Damascus highway
and Syrian army positions in eastern Bekaa valley the same night.
   ``This is not going to end. I am sure they're going to fight
again,'' said Ali Kawtharani, 35, a carpenter who took advantage of
Sunday's lull to flee with his wife and four sons. ``We'll be safer
in the south.''
   Several car convoys, roofs loaded with beds and mattresses,
streamed out of the Syrian-policed slums.
   Long queues formed outside supermarkets as others stockpiled
food.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the powerful
Maronite community, asked in his Easter sermon:
   ``How long should we be trapped like herds in shelters with
cannons and multibarreled rocket launchers raining various kinds of
death on us. Is this a way of living?''
   The Islamic orphanage in the Barbir district abutting Beirut's
dividing Green Line said it came under Christian shellfire before
dawn Sunday.
   ``A divine miracle saved our 300 maimed and retarded patients,''
the orphanage's statement said.
   The latest fighting began after Aoun blockaded illegal
militia-run ports that deprive the government of $100 million a
year in tax revenue.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss' Syrian-backed Cabinet rejected
Aoun's move and in turn blockaded the Christian enclave.
   Lebanon's rival governments emerged when former President Amin
Gemayel appointed Aoun to lead an acting military Cabinet after
parliament failed to choose a successor when Gemayel's term expired
Sept. 22.
   Syria keeps 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
mandate to end the war.

   A Silver Spring, Md., man who received what
was believed to be the nation's first successful heart-pancreas
transplant Saturday, could be out of the hospital in a few weeks,
hospital officials said Sunday.
   ``We think his recovery will be quite fast,'' said Dr. Jimmy A.
Light, Washington Hospital Center transplantation services
director. ``If his recovery is uncomplicated, we expect he will be
discharged within two or three weeks,''
   Barry Katz, 45, a senior scientist for the Strategic Defense
Initiative program, was a severe diabetic whose heart had been
damaged by the disease to the point that it no longer functioned
properly.
   ``This is a young man whose heart was basically destroyed by 25
years of diabetes but was basically healthy otherwise,'' Light
said. ``He was a very good candidate for a heart transplant.''
   Diabetes causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin, a
hormone that regulates the metabolism of sugar in the body. Doctors
decided that Katz's diabetes was so severe that complications would
result if only his heart were replaced.
   Katz was admitted to the hospital Friday. Hospital officials
said he was within days of death, and they decided to do both
transplants on Saturday.
   The Hospital Center proceeded with the operation although it
lacked official permission to perform pancreas transplants from the
district's State Health Planning and Development Agency. That
agency must approve new services and technology offered by local
hospitals.
   Hospital spokeswoman Clare Fiore said the hospital filed an
emergency application with the city last week to do pancreas
transplants, but had yet received no official approval, The
Washington Post reported. Fiore said if the hospital had waited,
Katz would have died.

<HEAD>India and Nepal Disagree Over Trade and Transit Treaties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India and Nepal on Sunday failed to
agree on new trade and transit treaties, Indian officials said,
raising fears the landlocked Himalayan kingdom may face shortages
of food and gasoline.
   The trade treaty expired a year ago and India terminated its
provisions Thursday, said the officials on condition of anonymity.
   A separate transit agreement expired Thursday, even though
Nepalese authorities had asked India to continue its provisions
until a new arrangement was signed, officials said.
   India closed 13 of the 15 customs check points along the
country's 1,090- mile border with Nepal after the treaties
terminated, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab Seth told reporters.
   The officials also said the Indian government imposed customs
duties on all goods exported from India to Nepal. Under the transit
treaty, India had allowed free access for overland transportation
of goods imported and exported by Nepal.
   Most of Nepal's foreign trade is either with India or conducted
through India, and border closings could lead to food and fuel
shortages.
   Nepal's foreign minister, Shailendra Kumar Upadhaya, met his
Indian counterpart, P.V. Narasimha Rao, in New Delhi on Sunday.
Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ministers
failed to reach an agreement.
   Seth said the two sides agreed to discuss the issue at a later,
unspecified time.
   Officials said Rao rejected a Nepalese proposal that the trade
and transit treaties should be negotiated jointly and not
separately, as India had suggested.
   India and Nepal have enjoyed friendly relations for decades.
There are no restrictions on travel between the neighbors.
   But reports from Katmandu said India was increasingly concerned
over Nepal's expanding relations with China. India fought a border
war with China in 1962 and since then, relations between the two
nations have remained uneasy.
   In August, Nepal reportedly bought unspecified Chinese arms for
its 30,000-strong armed forces.

   An early-morning fire destroyed a
recording studio on the farm of rock 'n' roll star Chuck Berry,
including a tape with some Berry songs, officials said.
   Authorities said the fire in the unoccupied building several
miles south of Wentzville was reported early Saturday. The
one-story concrete block structure is one of several buildings on
Berry's 160-acre farm west of St. Louis.
   The cause of the blaze was not immediately determined, but
officials discounted arson.
   Among the items destroyed in the fire was a master tape with 13
numbers Berry recorded over the last seven years. But Berry, 62,
was philosophical about the loss.
   ``All things change, nothing remains the same,'' he said.
``There's no way to put a value on it.''
   Berry, known for such '50s and '60s hits as ``Maybelline,'' ``No
Particular Place to Go,'' ``Roll Over Beethoven,'' ``Rock and Roll
Music'' and ``Johnny B. Goode,'' said he had not determined the
extent of the loss and was undecided about rebuilding the studio.

   Saying it is time to end the ``carnage and
havoc'' caused by assault weapons, the International Association of
Chiefs of Police announced its opposition Sunday to the guns'
public sale and distribution.
   ``It's time we put an end to the carnage and havoc that occurs
whenever an assault weapon gets into the hands of the wrong
people,'' said Charles D. Reynolds, chief of police in Dover, N.H.,
and president of the Arlington-based police chiefs' organization.
``We need to find a way to keep these weapons out of the hands of
criminals and misfits.''
   The resolution said it defined assault weapons as firearms with
a high rate of fire and capacity for firepower such that its
function as a legitimate recreational firearm is ``substantially
outweighed'' by its possible use to kill and injure people. Those
include the AR-15, Uzi, M-16 and AK-47, the group said.
   Reynolds said his group is working with people favoring and
opposing gun control ``trying to develop a reasonable position that
will curb access to these firearms while leaving undisturbed the
legitimate rights of sportsmen and hunters.''

   Pope John Paul II Sunday offered Easter
wishes in 55 languages to a world he said was driven toward
self-destruction, and the Roman Catholic patriarch in Jerusalem
blamed politicians for violence in the Holy Land.
   The patriarch, Michel Sabah, made his comments before pilgrims
at Easter Mass in Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the
site where Christians believe Jesus was resurrected.
   Elsewhere Sunday, shells and rockets pounded Beirut as Lebanese
Christians commemorated Easter, and in Afghanistan, about 30
members of the dwindling Western community gathered for services.
   In Czechoslovakia, Christians called for the pope to visit the
communist nation, and in some parts of the Soviet Union, Masses
were held for the first time in years.
   About 180,000 faithful crowded the Vatican's St Peter's Square
for John Paul's message commemorating the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.
   In his 20-minute speech in Italian, the pope decried religious
persecution, exploitation of women, degeneration of family life,
sectarian strife and lack of concern for the environment.
   Earlier Sunday, the pope, squinting in the warm spring sun, held
a Mass on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica.
   Calling Easter the new Passover, a reference to the Old
Testament account of the miraculous rescue of the Jews in Egypt,
the pope said: ``God passes where there do not exist conditions
worthy of a truly human life, through lack of housing, promiscuity,
vagrancy, where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage
and the family breaks up.''
   He also decried violence against children and the ``shameful
commerce of vice...(where) women are still the main victim.''
   The pope devoted much of his message, broadcast to 50 countries,
to places ``where consciences are oppressed, where Christ's
faithful cannot openly invoke him or suffer persecution because of
their love of him.''
   In Jerusalem, Sabah, the first Palestinian to serve as Roman
Catholic patriarch _ or bishop _ of the city, alluded to the
searing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in an Easter
Mass.
   Under flickering candles and the glare of television lights, the
Mass was intoned in Latin, French and Arabic as pilgrims from
throughout the world crowded the chapel that many believe contains
Christ's tomb.
   ``We find the reality of the Holy Land, a reality of death and
suffering,'' Sabah said in an Easter plea for peace.
   ``We find those who tell us each day: We are hungry, we are
humiliated, we are prisoners, we have no schooling,'' he said. ``We
find those who have died and those who have yet to die while the
politicians take their time finding answers.''
   Sabah, named bishop in January 1987, never directly mentioned
the Palestinian uprising that for 15 months has torn the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But his mention of the ``two peoples in this Holy Land'' and his
repeated references to death clearly evoked the revolt in which
more than 400 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died.
   In the Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia, many
Christians celebrated the Easter Mass for the first time in years.
Last year, Moscow handed back confiscated cathedrals to many
communities after decades in government hands.
   In Czechoslovakia, about 400 people gathered beneath the balcony
of 89-year-old Roman Catholic Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek's Baroque
residence shouting, ``Long Live Our Father!'' and ``We Want the
Holy Father!'' in a call for John Paul to visit Prague.
   The demonstration of religious feeling came two weeks ahead of
new negotiations between the Communist authorities and the Vatican
to appoint new bishops. Czechoslovakia is the only Soviet bloc
country where Communist authorities have for decades blocked the
appointment of religious leaders.
   In Britain, Archbishop Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the
Church of England, said: ``we live in a world in which the worst
looks as if it is going to happen and the worst often does happen,
and yet out of the anguish and waste, love and trust come in new
forms.''
   ``A sober look at the world seems to raise more fear than
hope,'' Runcie told the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral.

   For the first time in more than 70 years, Soviets
had a choice of candidates when they voted Sunday for a new
parliament in an election Mikhail S. Gorbachev hailed as a triumph
for his vision of democracy.
   However, maverick candidate Boris N. Yeltsin, running to
represent Moscow in the new 2,250-seat Congress of People's
Deputies, claimed many Soviets were worried about vote fraud and
said the election wasn't completely democratic.
   Polling stations in Moscow, festooned with red banners and
Soviet flags, opened at 7 a.m. Eleven time zones to the east, in
the Kamchatka and Chukotka regions of Siberia, polls closed as
Muscovites were still voting.
   The millions of voters elected 1,500 deputies to the congress,
which will choose the country's president and elect about 400 of
its members to a new full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet.
   The Communist Party, labor unions and other officially
sanctioned organizations have already directly elected 750 members
of the congress, which will meet once a year.
   Hundreds of races were contested for the first time in more than
seven decades. The election marked a revolutionary change in Soviet
politics, where the party has allowed only one approved candidate
to run for each seat since the days of Vladimir I. Lenin.
   The official Tass news agency reported brisk to heavy voter
turnout nationwide. At one precinct in Moscow's Krasnopresnenskaya
district, 84 percent of those eligible cast ballots, according to a
Soviet television report.
   Final results may not be known for several days.
   Unofficial results given to Western reporters at three Moscow
precincts showed Yeltsin leading his opponent, auto plant director
Yevgeny Brakov by 4,069 votes to 532, a margin of better than
7.5-to-1.
   Yeltsin campaigned against privileges afforded high Soviet
officials and called for speeding the pace of reform to improve
living standards for all.
   Gorbachev is already assured of a seat in the new congress, and
the elections are unlikely to produce any major upheaval in the
present power structure, which is dominated by the Communist Party.
   The last elections in which most Russians had a choice occurred
weeks after the November 1917 revolution that swept Lenin and the
Bolsheviks to power.
   In June 1987, two or more candidates competed in 4 percent of
the races for municipal offices in what amounted to a test for
greater democratization.
   But Sunday marked the first such balloting on a nationwide
scale. In 74 percent of the districts, there were two or more
competing candidates, the Central Election Commission said.
   However, according to the weekly Moscow News, 82 percent of
those running in Sunday's races are Communist Party members,
guaranteeing the country's ruling political party will dominate
whatever assembly emerges from the voting.
   Gorbachev, who with his wife Raisa voted at Moscow's Institute
of Chemical Physics, told reporters the occasionally boisterous
campaign caused by the multicandidate election was just what the
Kremlin leadership wanted.
   ``The electoral law that we passed has justified our hopes,''
Gorbachev said, as Mrs. Gorbachev, holding a blue umbrella, stood
beside him under a light rain. ``It has advanced the political
thought and social activity of the people, and this is what we
wanted to achieve.''
   The 58-year-old Gorbachev, already elected to the congress by
the Communist Party, picked up a paper ballot, walked to a wooden
voting booth and closed the curtain. After 25 seconds he emerged
and dropped his ballot in a box. He would not disclose for whom he
voted.
   The president said his policies of pressing for more democracy
and openness in Soviet society, while not permitting any legal
opposition to the Communist Party, are ``the key to opening the
potential of our socialist society, with the purpose of taking into
account the various interests of people and harmonizing them on the
basis of consensus or a majority.''
   Gorbachev said political pluralism is ``not a panacea for
solving problems and expressing a plurality of opinions.''
   Despite calls by some protesters for a multiparty system,
Gorbachev said he was confident most Soviets supported his views.
   Yeltsin, attempting a political comeback following his November
1987 ouster as Moscow's party boss, voted at the Young Pioneers
palace in the Soviet capital.
   He said the elections were ``not fully democratic'' but called
them ``a big step forward.'' He told reporters Soviets in
particular were ``worried about election results, worried that
there will be deviation at election stations during the vote
counting. Everything is troubling them.''
   Yeltsin, who has become an anti-establishment figure in the city
where he once headed the Communist Party machine, has charged the
city's party apparatus is out to sabotage his candidacy.
   The Moscow-based Central Election Commission, which counts the
ballots, said about 190 million of the Soviet Union's 285 million
people are eligible to vote.
   Tass said the commission began its round-the-clock job of
tabulating returns Sunday night, after receiving telegrams
containing preliminary results from the Soviet Far East. Commission
spokesman Nikolai N. Isaeev told reporters certified returns for
Moscow would be made public Monday night.
   The counting of ballots nationwide is expected to take several
days. The election commission is required to make full returns
public by April 5.
   All Soviets over 18 years old are permitted to vote unless they
have been certified insane. Nearly 180,000 neighborhood polling
stations opened their doors to voters Sunday morning and closed at
8 p.m. local time.
   Elections in the Soviet Union were until Sunday carefully
choreographed rituals in which practically all eligible voters were
said to turn out and those running got 99.9 percent of the vote.
Some Soviets expressed satisfaction at finally having a choice, but
there were also objections.
   ``I think the quality of our leaders will improve because now we
have a real democracy,'' said Dr. Valentina Agababova as she sat on
a windowsill at voting precinct No. 5 in Moscow's Sverdlovsk
district, crossing out names of candidates she opposed. ``Once upon
a time, we'd just take the forms and throw them into the ballot
box. Now, for the first time, we're really voting.''
   But in southwestern Moscow's Gagarin district, where 12
candidates were running, ``some old people have gotten upset about
having so many choices,'' said local elections secretary Natalya
Safonkina.
   Three Soviet cosmonauts aboard the Mir space station _ Sergei
Krikalev, Valery Polyakov and Alexander Volkov _ cast their ballots
from orbit, radioing their choices to ground control in a
less-than-secret ballot, Tass said.

   President and Mrs. Bush celebrated Easter
Sunday by attending a christening for their latest grandchild.
   The christening for Ashley Bush, who was born on Feb. 7 to the
Bushes' son, Neil and his wife, Sharon, was held at St. Alban's
Chapel on the grounds of the National Cathedral.
   The family began the day with Easter morning services at the
presidential retreat at Camp David and had an Easter dinner of
turkey, sweet potatoes and marshmallows, cranberry sauce, green

<TEXT>
   Twenty-nine more activists opposed to
nuclear weapons were arrested at the Nevada Test Site on Easter
Sunday, bringing to 283 the number cited during the eight-day
Lenten Desert Experience.
   About 75 demonstrators turned out for a prayer vigil at the main
entrance to the test site 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Department of Energy spokesman Jim Boyer said 27 people were
arrested on state trespass charges for crossing a cattle guard on a
road leading to the main gate. They were released on their own
recognizance.
   Two others were arrested at Mercury, a base camp inside the test
site grounds, on federal charges of trespassing on the test site
and were being held by authorities.
   Boyer said those reaching Mercury could have hiked across the
desert from one of two roads in the area, at distances of one to
four miles.
   Sunday's event marked the end of the eighth annual Lenten Desert
Experience, an anti-nuclear protest sponsored by the Las
Vegas-based Nevada Desert Experience.
   The 1,350-square-mile test site is surrounded only by a simple
barbed wire fence, although areas where tests are conducted are
heavily guarded.
   Mercury is about 27 miles from the nearest active testing area,
Boyer said.

<HEAD>Nicholas Brown's Desk Expected To Sell For New Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mahogany desk once owned by the
namesake of Brown University is expected to fetch a record price at
auction this summer, surpassing the $2.9 million sale of Marie
Antoinette's console table.
   Nicholas Brown's former desk-bookcase, which stands 9 feet, 5
inches tall, is expected to sell for more than $3 million at
Christie's in New York on June 3, according to antique experts.
   Marie Antoinette's console table was sold at Sotheby's in London
last November.
   ``There's never been anything like it on the market,'' Eddy
Nicholson, a New Hampshire collector, told Art &amp; Antiques magazine.
Thought to have been built in the 1760s, the desk is believed to be
one of 11 of its kind made by Newport cabinetmaker John Goddard.
Nine others survive.
   When Brown, the eldest of four brothers who made their fortunes
in shipping and manufacturing, died in 1791, the desk was the most
valuable object listed in his estate.
   His great-great-great grandson, retired Navy Capt. Nicholas
Brown, remembers the desk as ``the imposing artifact that
symbolized our inheritance.'' Every afternoon, he recalled, his
father would assemble the family in the study to have tea ``in the
shadow of that desk.''
   Brown, executive director of the National Aquarium in Baltimore,
has donated the desk to raise money to save a Providence mansion
purchased by his great-great grandfather in 1814.
   ``One icon is saving the other,'' Brown said.
   Christoper Monkhouse, curator of decorative arts at the Rhode
Island School of Design Museum, said such desks were considered
status symbols.
   ``It was a very political piece _ a way of telling your peers
who you were,'' he said.
   Brown University was named after the original Nicholas Brown,
whose father and uncles had been also been patrons of the
institution.

<HEAD>Soldier Honored 44 Years After Daring Feat To Release Jammed Bombs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THURMONT, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former soldier has finally gotten his
recognition _ 44 years after he climbed into a bomber's open bomb
bay with no parachute and manually dropped a dozen 250-pound bombs
over Nazi Germany.
   Russell Lee Fisher performed his feat in 20-below-zero
temperatures and thin oxygen at 17,000 feet while anti-aircraft
fire exploded around the plane, according to records. Authorities
say he almost certainly saved the lives of the eight-man crew.
   The retired civilian Army employee and former state commander of
the American Legion received the Distinguished Flying Cross in a
ceremony Saturday.
   On March 30, 1945, Fisher was in a B-17 bomber on a mission over
the city of Bremen when a malfunction made it impossible to release
the plane's bombs automatically.
   The technical sergeant from Thurmont climbed into the bomb bay,
hooked his leg around a small catwalk and began pulling pins that
released the bombs to plummet into a railroad yard and munitions
factory.
   ``It happened too fast to be scared. No one told me to do it, no
one asked me, I just went down because I knew it had to be done,''
Fisher said before receiving the medal.
   Although his colleagues at the time recommended he receive a
medal, the war soon ended and in the confusion his honor was
forgotten.
   Fisher didn't give it much thought until about five years ago
when he ran into Bernard E. Schlesinger Jr., the flight's navigator.
   ``He said, `I'm sorry the rest of the crew wasn't around when
you got your medal,''' Fisher remembered.
   ``I said, `What medal?'''
   Schlesinger, an attorney from Alexandria, Va., started
``scratching around,'' for information, working with Rep. Beverly
B. Byron, D-Md., to locate military records.
   ``I wouldn't take a million dollars for my experiences,'' said
Fisher. ``But I wouldn't want to live through them again either.''

<HEAD>Scowcroft Denies US Knows Who Bombed Pan Am Flight 103</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft
denied a report on Sunday that U.S. intelligence officials know who
carried out the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Scowcroft said, ``We are
not that far along'' in the investigation of the Dec. 21 bombing of
the jet, which broke apart over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270
people.
   The Sunday Times of London reported that an extremist
Palestinian faction financed by Iranian radicals is alleged to have
carried out the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, and U.S. intelligence
knows where the bombers are.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified sources in Washington as
saying the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command made and planted the bomb on behalf of Iranians seeking
revenge for the U.S. Navy downing of an Iranian civilian jetliner
over the Persian Gulf on July 3. All 290 people on board the
Iranian plane were killed.
   The newspaper quoted one source as saying the Palestinian group
was paid $10 million to destroy the New York-bound Pan Am jumbo jet.
   The organization is led by Ahmed Jibril, a Palestine Liberation
Organization renegade who opposes PLO chief Yasser Arafat's drive
for peace negotiations with Israel.
   Scowcroft said there was ``a marvelous bit of detective work
going on in this whole thing ... (but) So far as I know, yes, we do
not know specifically who did it.''
   ``As far as I know, we are narrowing it down significantly, but
I don't know that there is a resolution,'' Scowcroft said.

<HEAD>Truck Driver Wins Federal Suit Without Attorney; Awarded $200,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man whose formal schooling stopped at eighth
grade took on City Hall in federal court without an attorney and
won the largest award ever assessed the city for a political firing.
   ``I'm still amazed,'' said Eugene Wzorek, 44, who expects a
judgment totaling more than $200,000 after battling for five years
to get his truck driving job back. ``I don't see how I got through
it.''
   It wasn't easy, apparently even for U.S. District Judge Brian
Duff, who for four days last summer goaded and helped Wzorek
through the legal maze of presenting witnesses, introducing
documents, cross-examinations and a passionate closing argument.
   ``He was winging it,'' said attorney Linda Friedman, who
represented Wzorek during the second phase of the trial to
determine benefits.
   ``It's a fun transcript to read,'' she said. ``Through the whole
hearing, he apologizes many times to the judge and tells the judge:
`I'm trying like hell, judge. I'm trying like hell.'''
   Last Tuesday, Duff ordered Wzorek reinstated and set the damages
at $132,825 for back pay, $13,833 in interest, $3,750 in medical
costs, and pension credits of nearly $30,000.
   Another attorney who worked with Wzorek during the second phase
of the trial, John Gubbins, said the city probably will appeal, so
Wzorek won't get his damage award anytime soon.
   Gubbins said the judgment is the largest of its kind ever handed
down against the city.
   Wzorek also is being paid a salary and medical benefits
reinstated by Duff until next November, although Wzorek hasn't gone
back to work.
   During the first part of the trial, which established that he
had been improperly fired, Wzorek frequently called witnesses by
their first names, said ``OK'' and ``sure'' to the judge and told
an opposing witness he thought the man was lying.
   ``I'm nervous,'' Wzorek said to the judge at one point, ``and I
don't know what I'm doing.''
   Wzorek argued that he was fired in 1984 by the Harold Washington
administration because he gave $1,000 to the unsuccessful mayoral
campaign of Richard M. Daley.
   The city said he was fired because of poor performance and
absenteeism, even though Wzorek had high performance ratings and
good attendance.
   The city is prohibited by a previous court ruling from firing
employees for political reasons.
   When Wzorek first sued in 1984 he hired a lawyer, but the
lawsuit languished until last summer when Duff decided there would
be no more delays. At that time, Wzorek had no lawyer.
   ``I was scared to death,'' he said, ``but I was even more afraid
that if we didn't go to trial after all that time, the case would
be thrown out.''
   ``This shows the system does work,'' said Wzorek, ``...that a
little guy ... can take on the city and actually win, if he gets a
fair shake from a judge.''

<HEAD>Nigeria Bans `The Satanic Verses,' Protests Held In Britain, Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Nigeria said Sunday night he had ordered a ban
on the book ``The Satanic Verses,'' and new Moslem protests against
the novel and author Salman Rushdie reached from Britain to Japan.
   Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, president of Nigeria's military
government, told reporters the consitution prohibited material that
offended either Christianity or Islam, Nigeria's two major
religions.
   Moslems comprise nearly half of Nigeria's more than 100 million
people.
   Babangida, speaking in Lagos, would give no details of the ban
or say when it began. Speculation about a possible ban mounted last
week when customs agents started seizing copies of the book from
travelers arriving at airports and seaports.
   Senegal, Kenya and some other African nations also have banned
Rushdie's book, as have other nations with large Moslem populations.
   Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India, now is a British
citizen.
   He has been in hiding since Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, ordered his death on Feb. 14, saying Rushdie
blasphemed Islam in his book. Iranian clerics have put a $5.2
million bounty on his head.
   In the novel prostitutes take the names of the wives of Islam's
prophet Mohammed. Also, the book suggests that the Koran was not
divinely inspired as Moslems believe.
   In Moslem-dominated Pakistan, demonstrators protesting the book
promised to greet Britain's foreign secretary with black flags to
mourn his arrival on Monday, said Kausar Niazi, a protester in
Islamabad.
   The secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, is cutting his trip to
Pakistan from three days to 26 hours out of fear that Moslem
outrage over the book will provoke anti-British demonstrations,
officials said.
   Violent protests over the book have killed 19 people in India
and Pakistan. Both nations have banned the book.
   Hundreds of Moslems marched near the British Embassy in Tokyo on
Sunday and called on Japanese not to read ``The Satanic Verses.''
They also demanded that Rushdie be killed.
   Speeches at a pre-march rally were interrupted again and again
by protesters, who waved clenched fists and shouted, ``We want
Rushdie!'' and ``Death to Rushdie!''
   Police said about 200 people joined the demonstration.
Organizers put the number at 500. No incidents or arrests were
reported.
   The Japanese government has stressed the need for freedom of
expression and has not banned the novel.
   However, Raees Siddiqui, vice president of the 10,000-member
Pakistan Association in Japan, organizer of Sunday's protest, said
the government told him the book will not be allowed into Japan and
that attempts to translate it will be discouraged.
   In Britain, demonstrators burned effigies of Rushdie at two
weekend demonstrations and demanded that ``The Satanic Verses'' be
banned.
   More than 600 demonstrators marched Sunday in Reading, west of
London, and burned effigies of Rushdie at a rally in a park. Police
confiscated a ``Rushdie Must Die'' banner being carried by three
boys between the ages 6 and 8; a 4-year-old boy walking with his
father shouted ``Kill Rushdie!''
   A life-size effigy of Rushdie was burned and clubbed at a
demonstration Saturday by about 3,000 people in Dewsbury, West
Yorkshire, in northern England.

   The Iranian navy seized an Arab tycoon's
yacht carrying up to five members of Kuwait's royal family and four
Britons, diplomatic sources and news reports said Sunday.
   A British report said the Iranian Revolutionary Guards were
holding the yacht and demanding a ransom.
   There were conflicting accounts about the identities of the
hostages.
   Press reports in the Persian Gulf area said five members of
Kuwait's Al-Sabah royal family and four young British women were
taken captive when the yacht was seized Thursday afternoon.
   A diplomatic source in Kuwait, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the 82-foot yacht Sailka had four British male crew
members on board when it disappeared in the northern gulf on a trip
from Bahrain to Kuwait.
   The official Gulf News Agency in Bahrain issued a brief dispatch
late Sunday saying ``responsible sources in Bahrain and Kuwait
denied the reports circulated by new agencies about the loss of a
yacht carrying gulf and foreign individuals aboard.
   ``The sources in the two countries affirmed tonight that the
official quarters had no information about the loss of any vessel
or yacht or persons missing at sea.''
   A Kuwaiti source said a report carried by a Kuwaiti newspaper
about the missing yacht ``is completely baseless. The government
has no information whatever about the reported hijacking of the
yacht.'' The source spoke with the condition of anonymity.
   Britain's Independent Television News quoted diplomatic sources
in Kuwait as saying the yacht was seized for ransom after it
strayed into a sensitive area near Iran's Farsi Island.
   It did not identify the sources but reported they said Kuwaiti
government officials had leaked details of the abductions to the
Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Anbaa because Iran's Revolutionary Guards were
demanding a high ransom and negotiations between Kuwait and Iran
were going badly. Al-Anbaa reported the story under banner
headlines.
   A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Kuwait said, ``We have no
information yet. We read the report like you in the newspaper.''
   A spokesman at the British Foreign Office in London was asked
about the report and he said, ``We've asked our embassies in the
region but they know nothing about it.''
   Al-Anbaa said it had the names of the people aboard the
comandeered yacht but would not publish them ``to avoid affecting
the secret contacts going on with Iran at the highest levels to end
the incident.''
   But the usually reliable newspaper said that among the captives
was the son of a prominent Arab who is not from the gulf region.
   It said the blue-and-white yacht had departed from France and
docked at Bahrain. A distress signal was picked up at 4 p.m., six
hours after the vessel left Bahrain Thursday for Kuwait, according
to the report.
   George E. Covino, maintenance manager of Bahrain's Marina Club,
said a distress signal was received Thursday but the time he gave
was about two hours later than that given by Al-Anbaa.
   Covino reported that in the distress call a man speaking English
with an Arabic accent said: ``My yacht is burning. What can I do.''
The yacht club manager said the caller did not respond to a request
for his location.
   Gulf shipping executives noted that during the eight-year war
between Iran and Iraq Iranian boats frequently seized vessels if
they strayed into Iranian territorial waters.
   Farsi Island was a base for gunboats used by Iran's
Revolutionary Guards to attack oil tankers and other merchant ships
during the war, which was halted by a cease-fire last August.
   Kuwait was one of Iraq's main financial backers during the war,
and Iran claimed the ships its gunboats attacked were providing
supplies to Iraq.
   Kuwait registered 11 tankers in the United States and the U.S.
Navy provided a war fleet in the gulf to protect shipping. Other
foreign forces also sent warships into the gulf.
   Kuwaiti-Iranian relations had been improving since the
cease-fire, but friction surfaced March 15 when Kuwait said a
number of fugitives it was seeking for plotting a coup against the
government were operating freely in Iran.
   Three distant cousins of Kuwaiti's ruler, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah, were among 112 passengers and crew aboard a Kuwaiti
Airways jet hijacked by Shiite Moslem gunman last April on a flight
from Thailand to Kuwait. The hostages were released unharmed after
the 16-day ordeal ended in Algeria.

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the fallen protege of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, led his rival for parliament by a margin of
more than 7.5-to-1 in early, unofficial returns in Sunday's voting.
   Unofficial returns from three districts of the citywide Moscow
vote had Yeltsin ahead with 4,069 votes to 532 for Yevgeny Brakov,
director of the factory that makes ZIL limousines _ one of the
flashiest symbols of Soviet privilege, which Yeltsin targeted in
his campaign.
   Certified returns for the voting in Moscow would be made public
Monday night, said Nikolai N. Isaeev, spokesman for the Central
Election Commission.
   Yeltsin suggested earlier in the day that the Communist Party
might cheat him out of his political comeback by rigging the vote
count.
   Of more than 2,000 Soviets interviewed at polling places after
voting, 1,734 were for Yeltsin and 162 for Brakov. Others either
refused to disclose how they voted or expressed opposition to
either candidate.
   The informal poll, conducted by Western correspondents, was not
a scientifically accurate indicator of the outcome. But it
supported Yeltsin's claim to widespread popular support, which has
surfaced increasingly toward the end of the first seriously
contested political race in the Soviet capital at least since the
days of Lenin.
   Yeltsin's backers predicted he would win the support of 5
million of Moscow's 6.7 million eligible voters. Yeltsin himself
predicted victory but declined to specify a margin.
   Large pro-Yeltsin rallies were held in the capital in the
closing days of the campaign for the new 2,250 Congress of People's
Deputies, the first seriously contested open political race in
Moscow since the days of Lenin.
   ``People are worried about the election results, worried that
there will be deviations at election stations during vote
counting,'' Yeltsin told reporters after voting Sunday.
``Everything is troubling them.''
   ``Democracy depends on the election procedure, which hasn't been
tested yet,'' he said.
   Yeltsin, 58, who headed Moscow's powerful Communist Party
bureaucracy and held non-voting membership on the ruling Politburo
before his ouster, claims the party worked against his campaign.
   He accused party officials of restricting public access to his
campaign speeches and said they tried to damage his election
chances by setting up a commission in the final weeks of the
campaign to investigate his conduct.
   Yeltsin has demanded an end to special privileges for party and
government officials, such as access to special stores and
chauffeured luxury cars. He also has called for more radical
economic reforms to fill empty store shelves.
   Brakov, 51, has said his top priority is to end food shortages
by providing more machinery to farmers and improving storage and
processing facilities.
   When Yeltin was asked if he was satisfied with his campaign for
Moscow's at-large seat in the new congress, he said Sunday:
   ``Not in its entirety. Maybe it's because there are things we're
not used to. This leap to democracy had some positive and negative
processes.''
   The election campaign, he said, was ``not fully democratic'' but
was a ``big step forward'' from previous balloting in which only
one candidate was put forward for each post. But the real test of
democracy will be whether the vote count is fair, Yeltsin said.
   Gorbachev, who brought Yeltsin into the leadership in 1985 and
two years later oversaw his ouster on charges of making political
mistakes and displaying personal ambition, said criticism of party
officials is normal during campaigns and that Yeltsin was not the
only one who received it.

<HEAD>Eastern Seeks New Pilots In Class, Old Ones In Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikebound Eastern Airlines, nearly idle while
other carriers handled busy Easter weekend traffic, plans to return
to federal court Monday hoping to have its pilots ordered back to
work.
   The Miami-based carrier also intends to open a school for its
first group of 40 to 50 newly hired replacement pilots, Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said.
   Ms. Ceremsak said Eastern was forced to sit out what in years
past has been one of its busiest, most profitable weekends.
   Routes from the airline's Miami hub to the Northeast and from
Florida to the Caribbean were the most heavily traveled on past
Easter weekends, ``and of course they're not running them now,''
Ms. Ceremsak said Sunday.
   Under orders from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S.
District Judge Edward Davis scheduled new hearings in Miami to
determine whether the 3-week-old walkout by Eastern's 3,600 pilots
is a sympathy strike, as the pilots claim, or is a separate strike
seeking its own aims, as Eastern management contends.
   Eastern asked a panel from the appeals court, meeting last week
in Tallahassee, to overturn Davis' earlier ruling that let the Air
Line Pilots Association honor picket lines set up March 4 by
Eastern's Machinist union.
   ALPA claims the Railway Labor Act gives its members the right to
show sympathy for the striking Machinists. The appeals court
agreed, but added that ``a claim of a sympathy strike cannot be
used as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear
violation of the Railway Labor Act.''
   Eastern said if Davis finds that ALPA members stayed off the job
not out of sympathy but primarily to pursue their own contract
objectives, without having exhausted all collective bargaining
options under law, ``the court would be expected to order them back
to work.''
   The pilots, however, expressed cautious satisfaction with the
appeals court move, noting that the judges denied Eastern's request
for an immediate injunction.
   The appeals court ruling Friday called on Davis to report back
to the court after his hearings on the issue.
   The pilots union Sunday also continued to downplay Eastern's
efforts to hire replacement pilots, saying there simply aren't
enough pilots to fill available airline slots, especially at
Eastern and Continential Airlines, the other carrier operated by
Frank Lorenzo and his Houston-based Texas Air Corp.
   ``Young pilots know better than to go to work for Frank
Lorenzo,'' said Capt. Jack Saux, a Delta Airlines pilot and
chairman of ALPA's education committee. Saux said in a news release
that he and other ALPA members have been meeting with pilots from
regional airlines and corporations as well as student pilots across
the nation.
   ``If Eastern thinks these pilots will replace the striking
pilots at Eastern, they have another thing coming,'' Saux said.
``We know these pilots and they know us. They understand what's at
stake here.''

<TEXT>
   A poll shows Republican Dan Heath with a
narrow lead over Democrat Jill Long in the race to fill the
congressional seat once held by Vice President Dan Quayle. The
election is Tuesday.
   In a telephone survey of 1,019 registered voters in the 4th
Congressional District, Heath was favored by 44 percent to 36
percent for Long. About 20 percent were undecided.
   The House seat became vacant when Republican Dan Coats was
appointed to replace Quayle in the Senate. Coats had beaten Long, a
36-year-old business teacher at Indiana University-Purdue
University, by a 62-38 percent margin in the November election.
Heath, 36, is a former congressional aide to Coats.
   The campaign has received close attention from the congressional
campaign committees of both parties. Republicans have been intent
on keeping the seat in GOP control, while Gov. Evan Bayh has been
among those campaigning for Long in hopes of picking up an
additional Demcratic seat in the House.
   The poll was conducted March 19-22 for The Journal-Gazette of
Fort Wayne. It has a margin of effort of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

   An Indiana fugitive and his female companion
were both in comas Sunday from drug overdoses that occurred moments
before they were arrested, authorities said.
   Ronald R. Plummer, 39, and Elizabeth Bonvillain, 31, are
suspected in an interstate crime spree that included the taking of
a hostage in an Indianapolis hospital, an Illinois armed robbery
and the shooting of a police officer in suburban Milwaukee.
   They remained in drug-induced comas Sunday at St. Luke's
Hospital in Racine, but both were taken off the critical condition
list, said nursing supervisor Linda Cohn.
   Racine County Sheriff's Deputy Kenneth Sowinski said the two
were arrested Saturday morning when officers found them hiding in a
barn shortly after a patrolman who surprised them in a parked car
was shot in the hand.
   ``They were found buried between straw in a box stall,''
Sowinski said. ``Both appeared to be under the influence of drugs''
they had just taken, he added.
   Plummer, a federal prison inmate who had been in Indianapolis to
face robbery charges, is accused of escaping Friday with Ms.
Bonvillain's help after he contrived a visit to a hospital
emergency room. They are suspected of taking an X-ray technician
hostage and releasing him unharmed in Chicago.
   Police said Plummer has tried to escape from custody on at least
four occasions in Ohio and Kentucky since 1973.

<HEAD>Cabin Crews Oppose Armed Guards On Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Permitting guards to carry loaded weapons on
aircraft will not deter terrorists but could endanger the planes
and passengers, a trade union representing airline cabin crews said
Sunday.
   The Observer newspaper reported Sunday that police officers
escorting top politicians and members of the royal family are being
allowed to carry loaded guns onto British aircraft under security
regulations revised after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Security personnel have been permitted to carry only unloaded
firearms onto aircraft.
   ``The problem is that indiscriminate firing of guns, which could
always occur, could create as much damage as anything else,'' said
George Ryde, national secretary of the Transport and General
Workers Union's civil aviation group.
   The Transport Department said Sunday it would not discuss
security matters. The Civil Aviation Authority declined comment and
Scotland Yard said it had ``no knowledge'' of the matter.
   British Airways, which the Observer identified as one of several
airlines affected by the new order, also said it could not comment.
   Ryde said armed guards on aircraft would do little to deter
terrorists.
   ``If the glass or shell of an aircraft is punctured, it could
cause decompression with people being sucked out,'' he said.
   ``What could an armed guard have done to prevent what happened
at Lockerbie?'' he asked.
   Investigators have said a bomb caused Flight 103 to explode in
midair over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people
on board and another 11 on the ground. The bomb was contained in a
radio-cassette player in the baggage hold, they said.
   The Sunday Times of London reported an extremist Palestinian
faction funded by Iranian radicals was responsible for the bombing,
and that U.S. intelligence officials know where the bombers are.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in Washington,
reported that the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command made and planted the bomb on behalf of
Iranians seeking revenge for the U.S. Navy downing of an Iranian
jetliner over the Persian Gulf last summer. All 290 people on board
the Iranian plane were killed.
   The newspaper quoted one source as saying the group was paid 10
million dollars to destroy the New York-bound jumbo jet.
   The PFLP is led by Ahmed Jibril, a Palestine Liberation
Organization renegade who opposes PLO chief Yasser Arafat's current
drive for peace negotiations with Israel.
   U.S. National security adviser Brent Scowcroft Sunday denied the
report. Appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Scowcroft said, ``We
are not that far along'' in the investigation.
   ``As far as I know, we are narrowing it down significantly, but
I don't know that there is a resolution,'' he said.
   The Observer said the new Civil Aviation Authority regulation
reads: ``Firearms may be loaded when retained by police officers in
the passenger cabin of an aircraft.''
   The newspaper said the regulation was in a leaked copy of a
``restricted'' report on Flight 103 by the government's National
Aviation Security Committee.
   Ryde, a member of the committee, said armed police were not
discussed when the committee held a crisis meeting in January, or
at a regularly scheduled meeting in February. He said he had not
seen the report.

   The opposition, from both left and right,
claimed victory over the governing Motherland Party early Monday in
elections for thousands of local offices throughout the country.
   ``The trend from early returns shows that we are no longer the
first party,'' acknowledged Oltan Sungurlu, deputy chairman of the
center-right Motherland Party.
   Sunday's balloting did not directly affect the government of
Premier Turgut Ozal. But opponents called it a referendum on Ozal's
policies and Ozal said before voting began that he might quit if
voters favored opposition parties.
   Former Premier Suleyman Demirel, leader of the center-right True
Path Party, and Erdal Inonu who heads the leftist Social Democrat
Populist Party, both claimed victory over the Motherland Party.
   Inonu, a nuclear physics professor turned politician, declared,
``The people accomplished a real spring cleaning, making it clear
who they wanted to see in power.''
   Two people were killed and 35 were wounded in violence at voting
booths in rural eastern Turkey, the Anatolia news agency reported.
It said police detained 42 people in clashes between rival families
over voting for village leaders.
   Early returns, based on 10 percent of the votes, showed Ozal's
party losing mayoral races to the Social Democrats in Turkey's
three largest cities _ Istanbul, the nation's financial and
cultural center; Ankara, the capital, and Izmir on the Aegean coast.
   Returns from provincial assembly elections had the Motherland
Party in third place behind True Path and the Social Democrats.
   True Path, strong in rural areas, was getting 28.5 percent of
the vote nationwide, the Social Democrats 26 percent and Ozal's
party 21.5 percent.
   A Moslem fundamentalist party, Prosperity, was making a strong
showing in several provinces in eastern Turkey and capturing 9
percent of the votes nationwide.
   Ballots are counted by hand and unofficial results are not
expected until Tuesday.
   Voters elected more than 326,000 mayors, provincial assembly
members, city council members, village leaders and neighborhood
representatives.
   Ozal's mandate as premier runs until 1992, but his popularity
has been slipping and his record was a major election issue.
   During five years in power, Ozal has sought to rapidly modernize
Turkey, building new roads, public housing, power plants and an
improved telecommunications system. Trade has been liberalized and
Turkey has applied for membership in the European Economic
Community.
   But inflation that reached 75 percent last year cost Ozal
support.
   Public opinion polls before Sunday's election indicated Ozal's
party would fall below the 36 percent of the vote it drew in the
general elections in 1987 and the 41.6 percent in local polls five
years ago.
   Opposition politicians have said early elections would be needed
if the governing party drew less than a third of the vote.
   Ozal, 61, ended his campaign Friday telling voters he was
prepared to quit if opposition gains were so large it would be
difficult for him to govern.
   The premier said that only he can prevent a return to the
turbulence of the 1970s, when terrorism and an economic crisis
paved the way for a 1980 military takeover.
   Seven parties with nationwide organizations sought the support
of Turkey's 28 million eligible voters. The nation has a population
of 55 million.
   The parties are: Motherland, which advocates free-market
economy; the main opposition Social Democrat Populist Party; True
Path; the Democratic Left Party, led by former Premier Bulent
Ecevit; Prosperity; the conservative Reformist Democracy Party and
the Nationalist Labor Party, also conservative.

<TEXT>
   An elderly man who blacked out and
drove his car through a supermarket window, injuring at least 10
people, will not face any charges, police said Sunday.
   West Orange Police Chief Edward M. Palardy said Wolodymyr
Szpyrka, 80, will probably be asked to take another driver's test
and submit to a medical exam.
   ``There will be no criminal charges,'' Palardy said. ``As far as
civil, that's always possible in any accident.''
   Palardy said Szpyrka apparently lost control of his four-door
Buick after blacking out Saturday. The car jumped the sidewalk and
crashed through the plate glass windows of a Pathmark store,
halting against a cash register.
   Police said at least two cashiers and a half-dozen customers
were injured, along with Szpyrka and his wife Ewhenia, 70, who was
also riding in the car.
   Patrolman Dennis Walczak said all the injured were treated at
area hospitals and released.
   One of the most seriously injured, store cashier Marie Elmera,
30, of East Orange, was released from University Hospital in
Newark, nurse Regina Koeppel said. Ms. Elmera sustained back and
internal injuries.
   Police mechanics will probably examine the car Monday to see if
mechanical problems may have contributed to the accident, Palardy
said.

   A single-engine plane crashed into a
forested mountainside in turbulent weather, killing four foreign
students aboard, authorities said.
   The plane, a four-seat Socata TB-10, was en route from Bedford,
Mass., to Albany, N.Y., when it crashed Saturday night into the
eastern slope of the Berkshire Mountains' Taconic Range,
authorities said.
   Dr. Jeffrey Ross, a Berkshire County medical examiner, said the
three men and a woman were studying in the Boston area and were
from Latin America, Indonesia and Africa.
   ``Because of those backgrounds, it's taking us some time to get
word to their families,'' said Ross, who said he could not release
details of the victims' identities until relatives were notified.
   Although the weather at the time was described as a light
drizzle, the pilot radioed that he was encountering heavy
turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared from radar screens
at about 10:30 p.m.
   ``It appears that they had no prior warning that they were going
into a mountain,'' Major Jim Mackey of the Massachusetts Civil Air
Patrol told a Boston television station.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was investigating the
incident.

   A mob of about 50 people attacked five
police officers making an arrest Sunday, causing several minor
injuries, authorities said.
   The officers were responding to a report about a man armed with
a gun on a street in north Philadelphia shortly after 1 p.m.,
according to Lt. John Walsh. When police arrived to investigate, a
man fitting the description in the report punched two officers.
   About 50 people gathered while police handcuffed the man, Walsh
said. When the officers tried to get him into a police vehicle, a
second man attacked the officers and others in the crowd shoved the
five, he said.
   Police said they arrested cousins James Crawford, 22, and
Maurice Crawford, 19, on charges of assault, risking a riot and
resisting arrest.
   Walsh said no gun was found.
   A sister of James Crawford, Alicia Roberts, gave a different
account of the confrontation.
   She said her brother had been fighting with his girlfriend but
the argument ended before police arrived. James Crawford denied to
the officers that he had a gun but handed over a knife he was
carrying, Ms. Roberts said.
   She said the officers began pushing Crawford, bringing a protest
from their mother, Joanne White. At that point, Ms. Roberts said,
the officers started beating her brother with nightsticks and then
turned on Ms. Roberts and Ms. White.
   Ms. Roberts said she received five stitches to close a head
wound.
   Police declined to comment on Ms. Roberts' account. Walsh said
the five officers were treated for minor injuries at Hahnemann
Hospital. But hospital spokeswoman Linda Clossey said only two
officers were treated for head and knee injuries and released.
   According to Walsh, the first man in the altercation was treated
at St. Joseph's Hospital. A nursing supervisor there, who would not
give her name, said a man named Anthony White and a mother and
daughter she did not identify were treated and released for minor
injuries they received in the confrontation.

   A Palestine Liberation Organization

   The British weekly The Sunday Times reported that during the

Israeli government representatives and Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip.
   The Palestinians, while not being PLO members, must be approved
by the organization, The Sunday Times reported.
   The PLO agreed to the proposal with American assurances that
such contacts would be a step toward formal peace talks on the
Palestinian question, the report said.
   ``This report is baseless ... and this issue was not discussed
in the talks,'' PLO spokesman Abdul Rahman said in a statement
facsimiled by telephone from Cairo, Egypt to The Associated Press
from Cairo.
   The Sunday Times said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will
be presented with the proposal when he visits Washington April 6.

   A poll indicates Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's popularity is at an all-time low and that most West German
voters want a change of leadership, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Welt am Sonntag newspaper published the results of a recent poll
conducted by the Wickert Institute, which reported that 64.2
percent of the voters polled wanted Kohl replaced; 35.8 percent
wanted him to stay on as chancellor.
   The newspaper said the survey was conducted at the request of
140 companies and foundations nationwide. The institute polled
2,410 registered voters in 324 localities over a seven-day period.
The poll's margin of error was not given.
   Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union party has lost
ground in state elections since Kohl was re-elected in 1987. Most
recently the party lost control of the Frankfurt city government.
   The loss of popularity stems in part from a scandal over the
involvement of West German companies in an alleged Libyan chemical
weapons plant.

<TEXT>
   The tanker that caused the nation's
biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate
when the vessel ran aground on a reef, Exxon Shipping Co. said
Sunday.
   Alaska's governor, meanwhile, declared once-pristine Prince
William Sound a disaster area as the toll on the waterway's
abundant wildlife began to mount. The Coast Guard said the slick
and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of
about 100 square miles.
   Exxon Shipping spokesman Brian Dunphy told The Associated Press
that the captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez, Joseph Hazelwood, was
not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate
Gregory Cousins was in command.
   ``It's Exxon's policy that in the waters that the ship was
located in, the captain should have been on the bridge,'' Dunphy
said. ``There's a problem there in that he was not there. It's our
policy he should have been there.''
   An Exxon spokeswoman, Sharon Curran-Wescott, said she believed
Cousin's actions violated federal regulations.
   ``He didn't have a proper pilot's license for that. He wasn't
authorized by the company, nor was it legal,'' she said.
   Dunphy said he did not know why Hazelwood was not on the bridge.
   ``I am unaware of any explanation he has made at this time. ...
There is a full investigation that will occur on the incident,''
Dunphy said, adding that the captain is consulting with an attorney.
   As clean-up efforts continued Sunday, fishermen fearing lost
income sought compensation Sunday. Exxon Shipping Co. held a
meeting Sunday between fishermen and a company claims officer.
   ``We're not ready to absorb any loss,'' said Riki Ott,
spokeswoman for United Fishermen of Alaska. ``We expect full
compensation.''
   Ten supertankers remained anchored 33 miles from Valdez, unable
to move toward shore because the harbor remains closed. The Coast
Guard said it ordered the closure to prevent pollution from being
carried to Valdez on vessels passing through the oil.
   Department of Interior spokeswoman Pamela Bergmann said a
wildlife specialist sailed in the sound Saturday and observed 75
ducks and two otters coated with oil. They could not be captured
for cleaning, she said.
   Gov. Steve Cowper declared Prince William Sound a disaster area,
freeing state resources for cleanup and paving the way for a
federal disaster declaration.
   ``This oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit Alaska
since the Good Friday earthquake 25 years ago,'' Cowper said in a
news release. ``It requires the most thorough response we can
muster and this disaster declaration is an important part of that
response. We'll be requesting President Bush to make a similar
declaration.''
   The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels
of North Slope crude oil loaded at Valdez, ran onto a reef 25 miles
from the port early Friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to
avoid ice. Valdez is at the southern end of the 800-mile Alaska oil
pipeline.
   Estimates put the spill at 240,000 barrels of oil, or about 10.1
million gallons, making it the biggest U.S. spill on record. The
only larger oil-related accident in U.S. waters was the spilling
and burning of up to 10.7 million gallons of oil when two ships
collided in Galveston Bay in 1979.
   More than four miles of floating boom had been placed in an
effort to contain the oil, the Coast Guard said Sunday. An
additional 3,000 feet was to be deployed at Galena Bay at the
request of fishermen. Skimming boats worked to remove the oil.
   The Coast Guard estimated the area affected by the spill at 100
square miles. However, Exxon insisted that the area was only 10 to
12 square miles, and Coast Guard officials said they were at a loss
to explain the difference in estimates.
   The transfer of oil remaining aboard the Exxon Valdez to the
Exxon Baton Rouge resumed late Saturday. The Coast Guard said about
84,000 gallons of oil an hour was being transferred; at that rate,
the unloading could take seven days.
   By late Sunday, Exxon officials said a total of 37,500 barrels
of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation,
leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship.
   Tests were under way to determine if dispersal chemicals should
be used despite the potential for environmental damage. The agents
need wave action to help break up the thick crude oil. Weather had
been calm since the accident, but the National Weather Service said
the wind was expected to increase to 25 mph and stir up a 5- to
6-foot chop on the sound.
   However, the wind and waves may make it more difficult to skim
oil off the water, said Coast Guard Lt. Ed Wieliczkiewicz.
   An experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil
was completed early Sunday and the Coast Guard said Exxon officials
were ``cautiously optimistic.''
   Environmentalists, the governor and other top state officials
have accused Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. of responding
too slowly to the spill. Alyeska operates the terminal at Valdez
that loads tankers with North Slope crude.
   Both companies said they were satisfied with the handling of the
problem.
   ``We're proceeding cautiously,'' said Exxon spokesman Tom
Cirigliano. ``We want to make sure we don't make any mistakes in
cleaning up the spill.''
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said Exxon has
reviewed information gathered by divers and determined there are
five holes in the vessel's hull on the starboard side. The largest
is 20-by-6 feet.
   All six tanks along the port side remain intact. Four are oil
tanks; two are ballast tanks.
   Investigation of the accident was turned over to the National
Transportation Safety Board on Sunday. The ship's captain and two
bridge crew members, including Cousins, were relieved of duty
Saturday and subpoenaed by the NTSB.
   Iarossi said relieving the three was intended to allow them rest
and was not a disciplinary measure. Hazelwood was in his cabin at
the time of the accident, Iarossi said.
   The third member of the bridge crew was identified as helmsman
Robert Kagan.
   The three were administered routine tests for drug and alcohol
abuse, but the results were not immediately available, officials
said.
   The spill came at a time when Prince William Sound fishermen
were preparing for the herring season, which is followed by
harvests of shellfish and salmon.
   Many are concerned they will get only minimal harvests because
of the oil damage, and then will face the longer-term problem of
bad publicity.
   ``This could ruin our reputation in Asian markets for years to
come,'' said Jim Brown, a netter.
   The herring catch, which usually takes place in April, primarily
is for the harvest of roe, a delicacy that brings up to $25 per
pound in Japan.
   ``It's possible they could avoid the oil,'' Brown said. ``Fish
are not stupid. But they can't avoid the chemicals.''
   Rick Steiner of the University of Alaska Marine Advisory Program
said the beaches on which the herring spawn could be polluted.
   Fishermen said they have had two good years back to back, and
some were spurred by that success to go into debt for new equipment
this year.
   Ott said fishing is an economic mainstay in Cordova, more so
than in Valdez, which also draws tourists and has the oil terminal.
   ``Half of Cordova is operating on credit,'' Ott said.

<HEAD>Protesters Halt Logging In Friendly Standoff; 13 Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An unusually friendly standoff between
environmentalists and loggers in a national forest resulted in 13
arrests Sunday, including that of a man who buried himself
neck-deep in a rock barricade.
   The demonstrators at the Willamette National Forest were charged
with disorderly conduct for blocking a road into the controversial
North Roaring Devil timber sale site, according to a Marion County
sheriff's dispatcher.
   About 30 protesters had camped on a bridge over the Breitenbush
River and were there to greet Bugaboo Timber Co. workers when they
arrived for a third day of logging in the disputed area.
   The U.S. Forest Service has sold timber rights in the North
Roaring Devil site for $1.6 million. Logging began Friday at the
33-acre area, located on a remote ridge about 60 miles southeast of
Portland.
   About 20 loggers gathered around the protesters' bonfire when
they were unable to proceed into the cutting area, and the two
sides spent several hours peacefully discussing their opposing
views on old-growth logging.
   The protesters argued that the timber site is forested with
old-growth trees that are hundreds of years old and is a nesting
ground for spotted owls, which they say are endangered.
   ``I feel real sympathetic towards the loggers,'' said Leslie
Hemstreet, a protester from Portland. ``I know they have to make a
living and they have to feed their kids, but we need to come up
with an alternative for them instead of cutting these trees down.''
   The timber cutters stressed that their livelihoods are at stake
and argued that the stand of timber at issue is comprised of
second-growth trees, not the ancient old-growth trees.
   ``People need to sit down and talk things out,'' said Bugaboo
Timber contractor Dennis Nielsen. ``Something needs to be done.''
   ``As far as I'm concerned, these people are protesting the wrong
people,'' Nielsen added. ``They should be protesting the U.S.
Forest Service, not us.''
   The timber sale already is the focus of a environmental lawsuit
challenging Forest Service timber management practices in the
Willamette National Forest.
   Sunday's arrests were made after the loggers left and sheriff's
deputies arrived, accompanied by Forest Service workers. The
banner-carrying protesters obeyed an order to move off the bridge,
but proceeded further along the logging road, refusing to clear the
way.
   Authorities arrested the protesters at a 3-foot rock wall that
had been built across the road, apparently overnight. A member of
the radical environmental group Earth First! was buried up to his
neck in the barricade.

   A volcano on the island of Stromboli
spewed a shower of ash Sunday and a West German tourist fell and
broke her arm as she fled down the mountainside, the Italian news
agency ANSA reported.
   It said there were no other casualties and authorites did not
see any cause for concern after the eruption Sunday morning.
   The volcano, which dominates the small island north of Sicily,
has been relatively inactive for about three years but almost daily
it sends forth bursts of flames and smoke, according to ANSA. The
agency said the displays attract tourists who ascend the mountain's
slopes with guides.
   ANSA identified the injured woman as Ulrike Wender, 20, of
Hohenwaret, West Germany. It said a group of tourists had camped
overnight on the mountain after watching the nocturnal show of fire.

   However, maverick candidate Boris N. Yeltsin, running to

the election wasn't completely democratic.
   Polling stations in Moscow, festooned with red banners and

the Kamchatka and Chukotka regions of Siberia, polls closed as
Muscovites were still voting.
   The millions of voters elected 1,500 deputies to the congress,
which later will choose the country's president and elect about 400

   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin broke his
silence on political affairs Sunday by using the 10th anniversary
of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty to criticize the United States
for opening talks with the PLO.
   Begin and the other surviving architect of the historic treaty,
former President Jimmy Carter, praised the pact but expressed
regret that it did not lead to a comprehensive settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the pact assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat four years after he signed it.
   There were no official ceremonies marking the occasion,
reflecting the chilly relations between the two former Middle East

   Yellowstone, its image
hurt by fires, starving elk and the slaughter of bison, is the
focus of a high-powered public relations effort to restore the
gleam to the national park system's crown jewel.
   Nature is slowly healing the wounds left from the summer of
1988's forest fires that burned nearly 1 million acres of the
2.2-million-acre park. But Yellowstone's magical lure is being
crippled by vivid images of 200-foot-tall walls of flame that were
projected into America's homes by television last year.
   ``The more sensationalistic coverage led the public to believe
that Yellowstone simply burned up, that there was nothing left,''
said Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. ``That's very far from
the truth. The park is open, it's alive, it's well.''

   The National Security Agency and a research
arm of the Commerce Department have reached an agreement aimed at
strengthening protection of sensitive information handled by
thousands of federal government computers.
   The memorandum of understanding was signed late last week by the
NSA's director, Vice Adm. W.O. Studeman, and Raymond G. Kammer,
acting director of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
   Under prodding from Congress, the two agencies have started
working closely together to review computer security plans
submitted by offices throughout the government for safeguarding
systems containing sensitive but unclassified data.
   The effort has been spurred by mounting concern over so-called
computer viruses, including a virus ``attack'' last November that
crippled more than 6,000 computers connected to the Defense

   The Bush administration's heralded plan to
relieve the staggering Third World debt burden faces its first big
test this week when Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady tries to sell
the proposal to finance ministers from around the world.
   The sales talk will come at the spring meeting of the 151-nation
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the two major lending
organizations, and at a separate strategy session attended by
officials from the seven largest industrial countries.
   The sessions should be lively. Already, the Brady plan is being
viewed as a crucial watershed for the 7-year debt crisis, which has
at various times threatened financial calamity for major U.S. banks
and turned Latin America into a political time bomb as struggling
democracies in the region tried to cope with growing debt
repayments.
   The Brady plan, as the new initiative is being called, seeks to
encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of the $1.3
trillion in debt owed by poor countries in return for guarantees
backed by the IMF and World Bank that the remaining pool of debt
will be repaid.

<HEAD>General Electric Teaches Computer To Keep An Eye On Takeovers</HEAD>

   Takeover strategists, take note: Your future
competition may have more in common with R2-D2 than with T. Boone
Pickens and Carl Icahn.
   General Electric Co. says it has taught a computer to keep track
of mergers and acquisitions by reading the Dow Jones news service
ticker.
   The finance-minded software package, called Scisor, was created
by the wife-and-husband team of Lisa F. Rau and Paul S. Jacobs at
GE's Research and Development Center in Schenectady, N.Y.
   The prototype software could be adapted to ``almost any area in
which human beings under intense deadline pressure have to struggle
through smothering amounts of paperwork,'' GE said in an
announcement for release Monday.
   Users can ask the computer questions in simple English and get
answers back the same way, GE said, giving this example:
   User: Who received an offer from Bethlehem Steel?
   System: Bethlehem Steel took over Rail Mill.
   The colorless language and relatively limited vocabulary of the
Dow Jones wire made it ideal for experimentation, Ms. Rau said in
an interview last week. Scisor did have some trouble at first with
``sweetened'' bids and ``tender'' offers, she said.
   ``It's not reasoning with the information. It's simply taking
the facts in a story and putting them down. It doesn't know if
something is true or false or reasonable or unreasonable,'' she
said.
   The Dow Jones wire, also called the ``ticker,'' contains
boiled-down company announcements, corporate earnings reports,
government actions affecting business and other information of
interest to the investment community. The wire, a fixture in
investment houses, is part of Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., the publisher
of the Wall Street Journal.
   GE's own Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. brokerage unit is interested in
Scisor and will be given a demonstration in coming weeks. But GE
spokesman Peter Gwynne said it may be one or two years before any
part of GE begins offering a Scisor-based product.
   The text enters the computer electronically and the user
communicates with the machine through a keyboard. It has a
vocabulary of about 10,000 words.
   The system figures out a text by diagramming sentences in the
manner of junior high school English classes. It extracts
additional sense by using programmed-in expectations _ for example,
that the bigger company is usually the acquiring one.
   Ms. Rau said some financial people who have seen Scisor in
action are surprised how well it does.
   ``In the distant future, we can imagine the computer not as a
static repository of information but as a librarian who not only
knows where all the information in the library is kept, but also
has read and understood everything in the library,'' Ms. Rau said
in the written announcement.

   Voters in Phoenix and its suburbs decide Tuesday
whether to add a half-penny to their sales tax to finance an $8.4
billion highway and transit program, including a controversial
103-mile elevated railway.
   The metropolitan area of 2 million people is the nation's
largest without an integrated freeway system. A vast grid of
north-south, east-west streets is stamped across the desert,
relieved only by two Interstate highways and a piece of state
freeway.
   Maricopa County residents are saddled with some of the highest
auto-insurance rates in the nation partly because of intersection
collisions.
   ``The population of this valley is going to double in the
future, whether we like it or not,'' says Herb Drinkwater, mayor of
the wealthy suburb of Scottsdale. ``I've been here 43 years, and I
don't always like it, but we have to deal with it, and there's no
way that there can be enough roads built to handle the traffic.
   ``We've got to get out of our cars and get them off the road.''
   Response to Proposition 300 and its addition of a half-penny to
the 6-cent sales tax is mixed. Neighborhood preservationists and
tax-dollar watchers have lined up against it while expansionists in
the metropolitan area called the Valley of the Sun back it.
   The ambitiousness of the ValTrans proposition can be read in its
statistics _ expansion of the bus system from 350 vehicles to
1,500, running longer expanded hours; 23 miles of commuter rail; 27
miles of rapid-transit bus routes; and the 103 miles of automated
rapid-transit rail lines.
   Cost estimates range from $8.4 billion to $10.4 billion by the
year 2019, but proponents call it about $44 annually for an average
household.
   Moreover, they say, the system will create 7,000 jobs and will
help clean the air over the valley.
   Air travelers approaching the city may be surprised by a brown
haze obscuring nearby mountains. The metropolitan area has just
gone through a voluntary program to cut down on car use and other
pollution causes. A new state law requires that gasoline be blended
with oxygen additives, similar to a program in Denver, six months
of the year to cut pollution.
   Drinkwater said the arguments against ValTrans were put forth 25
years ago against creation of a freeway system. That successful
fight against unified freeway planning led the current chaotic
state of driving here, he said.
   The only operating freeways in the metropolitan area are
Interstate 10, which comes in from the west and bends southeastward
toward Tucson; Interstate 17, which splits off I-10 and heads north
to Flagstaff; and State Route 360, the Superstition Freeway, which
extends eastward from I-10 in Mesa.
   About 100 miles south, I-10 is the only freeway in Tucson. But
while that Pima County seat has only about one-third as many people
as greater Phoenix, a coalition recently unveiled plans for a 1
percent sales-tax hike to raise $6.8 billion for transportation and
other improvements there.
   The rail system is the sticking point for most ValTrans
opponents.
   ``We agree that there are traffic-congestion problems,'' says
George Chasse, chairman of Voters Against Senseless Transit. ``VAST
is not against mass transit but against the part of Proposition 300
that includes 103 miles of light rail.''
   He and others said they doubt that Arizonans, accustomed to the
California-pioneered style of suburban sprawl and freeway driving,
would ever take a train to work.
   However, Ben Greenfield, an insurance agent in Scottsdale, said
residents might welcome a chance to use alternative transportation.
   ``As an individual, I think it's a good idea for the greater
good of everybody,'' Greenfield said. ``If it eliminates some of
the cars and gets some order to this thing, it's a good idea.''

<HEAD>Dollar Firms Slightly, Stock Prices Edge Down In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar firmed slightly in early trading
against the Japanese yen Monday, while stock prices edged down.
   The dollar opened at 131.68 yen, up 0.41 yen from Friday's close
of 131.27 yen.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said there was some demand for
the dollar but otherwise the market was extremely quiet in the wake
of a three-day Easter holiday overseas.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 20.14-point loser Friday, shed another 14.97
points, or 0.04 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to
31,553.55.
   Currency and stock markets in New York will reopen Monday, while
both markets in London will be closed until Tuesday.
