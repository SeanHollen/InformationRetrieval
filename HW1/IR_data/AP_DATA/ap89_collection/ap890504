<HEAD>Coal Strike Calms Down, Mediation Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pickets were peaceful Wednesday as striking
coal miners assessed a breakthrough in negotiations that followed
violence the day before.
   United Mine Workers and Pittston Coal Group Inc. representatives
agreed to sit down with federal mediators to discuss their
contract, and a mediator with the U.S. Labor Department's Mediation
and Conciliation Service discussed the ground rules and agenda with
union and company officials Wednesday.
   Neither a date for a meeting nor the principal negotiators have
been agreed upon by both sides.
   ``I always thought somebody else would have to step in,'' said
Sidney Burden, a striking miner who has worked for Pittston for 42
of his 64 years.
   About 1,500 miners in Virginia and West Virginia had been
working without a contract for 14 months when they went on strike
April 5.
   Burden, sitting along the picket line, said he hoped an
agreement could be reached quickly. ``The longer it goes on the
worse it's going to be,'' he said.
   Tuesday, violence broke out as trucks were hauling coal from a
Pittston mine to one of the company's processing plants near St.
Paul, 100 miles from the southwestern tip of the state.
   A coal truck and an escort pickup truck were pelted with rocks
thrown by striking miners, according to state police spokesman
Charles Vaughn. One hurled rock broke a driver's jaw and another
knocked a driver unconscious, said Pittston Coal Group President
Michael Odom.
   The coal truck then ran into striking miners and collided with a
parked truck with miners inside, injuring seven strikers, two of
them seriously.
   UMW President Richard Trumka suggested a seven-day cooling-off
period beginning Wednesday during which Pittston would stop hauling
coal and strikers would halt demonstrations.
   Odom said Wednesday that Pittston will not stop production.

<DATELINE>ABUSIR, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He was an ancient Egyptian turncoat,
backbone of the pharaoh's government one day and strong right arm
of the conquering Persians the next.
   Most of what the world knows of Udjahorresnet comes from
inscriptions on his statue in the Vatican collection, which boast
of his calculated opportunism and the power his treachery won him.
   But it's a tale without an end _ the finale missing, the last
lines obscured.
   Now, in the depths of a desert burial maze, Czechoslavak
scientists are finding clues to the fate of one of pharaonic
Egypt's dastardly personalities.
   Almost 60 feet down, at the foot of a central shaft cut through
soft petrified clay and filled with sand, the team discovered a
burial chamber.
   ``What a shock to see his name, Udjahorresnet, in such an
unexpected place, away from his home'' in the Nile delta, ``away
from his Persian connections,'' said Miroslav Verner, head of
Egyptology at Charles University in Prague.
   ``It was thrilling,'' Verner said. ``His name is what all
Egyptologists learn first when they study the Persian takeover of
Egypt. ... He was a dark personage, a man known for his betrayal.''
   Verner has been field director since 1976 of a Czechoslavak
archaeological mission in Abusir, an ancient burial and religious
center 18 miles southwest of Cairo.
   Mission scientists discovered a series of rubble-filled shafts
in 1981 on a site misidentified 150 years earlier as a pyramid
ruin. Verner's 10-man team and colleagues from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization began excavating last November.
   Udjahorresnet took few chances in life and fewer in death. The
maze of shafts he commissioned used a traditional method for
repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand, and was more
intricate than others found in Egypt.
   He was a trusted official of the 26th-dynasty Pharaoh Psamtik
III, then turned up as colonial administrator after Cambyses of
Persia conquered Egypt in 525 B.C.
   Little is known of Udjahorresnet's later life.
   ``The last we knew of him, he was leading an Egyptian army to
help the Persians under Darius I, Cambyses' son, put down internal
strife,'' Verner said. ``Then he disappeared from history. The
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was
ever found.''
   That obscurity may be about to end.
   In the limestone chamber at the bottom of the Abusir shaft,
excavators found a megalith-sized sarcophagus sheltering an inner
coffin with decorated sides. They bore the name Udjahorresnet.
   The chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles,
but Verner said team members found five small statuettes with the
names of Udjahorresnet and his parents, and a list of his titles.
   Since the 1960s, the pyramid-domed sands of Abusir have yielded
several major finds to Czech archaeologists: the oldest papyri
found in Egypt, the oldest hall with standing columns and several
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty, more than 4,000
years ago.
   Once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor, the Giza
Plateau, Abusir became one of Egypt's most exciting archaeological
sites.
   Because of his important titles _ Egypt's chief physician and
overseer of the royal navy and Greek mercenaries _ Udjahorresnet
would have been ``a man in the know when the Persian invasion
came,'' Verner said.
   ``History doesn't record his exact role,'' the archaeologist
said, ``but the next thing we know after Egypt's defeat is that
this man was part of the Persian regime, close to Cambyses: his man
in Egypt, you might say, highly rewarded for his new loyalty.
   ``Udjahorresnet even boasts ... that he put together Egyptian
titles for the new Persian ruler. He was a 100 percent quisling, an
opportunist.''
   His statue, obtained by the Vatican collection 200 years ago, is
thought to have left Egypt with the Roman Emperor Hadrian early in
the second century.
   Hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa
at Tivoli near Rome.
   The architect of Udjahorresnet's tomb used sand, in an
hour-glass effect, first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then
to seal the passages, Verner said. The burial chamber's roof
contained holes with clay pots beneath, which the last worker broke
one-by-one as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in
from a shaft above, the archaeologist said.
   At least four grave-robbing forays were made into the shaft, the
latest in medieval tims. Verner said robbers finally tunneled
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using
fire and water alternately to weaken it.
   ``During their robberies, the thieves lived in the shafts,'' he
said. ``We know all about them from rubbish they left'' and the
soot from their fires.

   A lottery in the Ukrainian city of Stakhanov
didn't top the $115 million jackpot offered last week in
Pennsylvania, but the winners seemed happy with their prizes: rolls
of toilet paper.
   The newspaper Literary Gazette on Wednesday told the story of
Ira, a girl who bought three tickets and walked away with several
rolls of toilet paper, a towel and a small bowl.
   The lottery tickets cost 50 kopeks _ about 81 cents _ more than
the actual price of many of the prizes.
   ``But, don't forget that there are great shortages,'' Literary
Gazette said. ``In the city of Stakhanov, except for the lottery,
one cannot get these goods.''
   Soviet consumers are suffering through chronic shortages of many
household goods and food products. Store shelves in Moscow are
barer than they have been in years, and the situation in the
provinces is worse. Thousands of people come to the capital every
day to shop in its stores.
   Other lucky ticket holders in Stakhanov won hens, pigs, goats,
detergent and bath soap, the newspaper said. It did not specify the
date of the drawing.
   One winner ``could not bring to his house everything he won. In
one hand he had a hen, in the other, there were four packets of
laundry detergent,'' the newspaper said.
   ``The lucky people were bringing hard-to-get products from the
park,'' it said. ``Seventy people won toilet paper and 50 of them
boxes of detergent.''
   An old woman who didn't read about the lottery in the local
newspaper was dismayed as she watched the people leaving with items
that were not at the shops.
   ``My God, where are you getting this stuff?'' the newspaper
quoted her as asking a winner.
   Literary Gazette said ``she had no idea that in the pockets of
other happy people there were bars of soap and boxes of detergent.''
   According to lottery results, the organizers sold 20,000 tickets
and pocketed about $3,890 by giving away prizes that cost less than
the tickets. The newspaper did not explain how the organizers
obtained the goods that were given away.
   The lottery was held in honor of the 175th anniversary of
Stakhanov, a city of 112,000 people about 500 miles south of
Moscow. It was founded in the 19th century as Kadievka, but renamed
to honor coal miner Alexei Stakhanov, who was held up by dictator
Josef Stalin as a model worker for far exceeding average coal
yields.
   His feat in 1935 spawned a movement of workers who strove to
emulate him as Stalin led the Soviet Union on a course of crash
industrialization. Stakhanov is located in the Don Basin coal
mining region of the Ukraine.

<DATELINE>ON THE SALANG PASS, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young soldiers had reason
to cheer along this dusty, rutted road lined with the burned-out
skeletons of tanks and trucks and bombed-out mud-and-brick villages.
   They had wrested control of the road to the Soviet border, the
lifeline for the capital, Kabul.
   Until a month ago, it had been under the control of rebel
commander Akmed Shah Masoon and his Jamait-i-Islami group, who
frequently clamp a stranglehold on the route and cut off essential
supplies of food and fuel.
   And the soldiers appeared more determined than ever to keep it
from falling back into Masood's hands.
   ``If he tries to take it again, we'll teach him a lesson he
won't forget,'' said one 30-year-old soldier, who gave his name
only as Capo.
   On Wednesday the government took a small contingent of foreign
journalists along a 20-mile stretch of the highway. It was the
first such trip since the Soviet Union 2{ months ago pulled out the
last of its troops who had been supporting the Marxist Afghan
government.
   Along the road that winds through the majestic Hindu Kush
mountains north toward the Soviet border, the soldiers stood beside
their embattled roadside checkpoints and mountaintop observation
posts as the small caravan of armored personnel carriers passed.
   Some of the soldiers saluted. Others waved or applauded. For
them, it was their moment of triumph in the midst of widespread
destruction. Nothing stood intact from years of shelling and
bombing.
   Their success would not have been thought possible in
mid-February, when the Red Army ended nine years of military
involvement in Afghanistan. Many people predicted the Afghan armed
forces would be plagued by mass defections. Those who did not
switch sides _ according to one line of conjecture _ would not be
able to stand on their own against the guerrillas, armed and
supported by the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China.
   Brig. Gen. Mohammad Shafi said his group proved them wrong.
   ``It needs no further explanation. You can see for yourself,''
said Shafi, who assumed commnd of the infantry unit that guards the
road a few weeks before the final Soviet pullout.
   The village of Bagh-e-Maidan, about 65 miles north of Kabul, is
proof of the devastation of 11 years of fighting between the Afghan
armed forces and the Moslem guerrillas.
   ``Masood was responsible for this,'' Shafi said of the ruins
that were once an ancient village carved in the mountain.
   But some soldiers under his command disagree.
   ``The Russians did it,'' said one soldier.
   The soldier, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
said about 500 people were killed in one pulverizing raid on
Bagh-e-Maidan.
   Shafi estimated that 180 villages in the area had been destroyed
over the years. No one knows how many people were killed.
   The United States earlier this year accused the Soviet Union of
``carpet bombing'' to clear the area before the final Red Army
pullout on Feb. 15. The Soviets denied it.
   But in late January, the Soviet and Afghan armed forces launched
a three-day offensive with bombers, artillery and tanks to clear
the Salang. Officials said at least 650 people were killed.
   About four miles farther north, the smell of smoke permeates the
air and the roadside is cluttered with rows of destroyed tanks and
supply trucks.
   Soldiers said the rebels had stopped the vehicles and demanded
some kind of toll to pass through. If they refused, the driver was
shot and the vehicle was doused with fuel and set ablaze,the
soldiers said.
   A month ago, the military moved in and cleared the area in a
gunbattle that left at least 250 rebels dead. Masood's lieutenant,
Abdul Bashir, was wounded but escaped, Shafi said.
   About 400 government troops occupy the area now.
   ``There hasn't been a major battle since then,'' Shafi said.
   And he said the road has been open for columns of supply convoys
to move toward Kabul.
   On Tuesday night, the general said, 1,800 trucks and tanks began
moving slowly toward Kabul and would reach the capital soon.
   The convoy had not reached the city of 2.25 million by Wednesday
night.
   Soon, he said, it may not matter. The government has been
constructing another route to detour through the rebel-controlled
areas.

<HEAD>Obey Holds Up Central American Money Over Honduran Aid Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee chairman vowed Wednesday
to hold up the release of more than $700 million in foreign aid for
Central America until the State Department answers new questions
about a secret quid pro quo deal between the Reagan White House and
Honduras.
   ``I don't expect to recommend any money for Central America
until we have some questions answered,'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations, said in a telephone interview.
   ``I am not trying to suggest that I would withhold aid for
Central America if the answers we get are answers I don't like,''
Obey added. ``But I do have an obligation to get those answers
before we provide any additional assistance to the same countries.''
   Documents released at the trial of former White House aide
Oliver L. North show that on Feb. 19, 1985, then-President Ronald
Reagan approved a plan to give Honduras ``incentives'' to support
the Nicaraguan contras after Congress stopped all U.S. military
assistance to the rebels. Major elements of the plan were carried
out, documents showed.
   A jury is deliberating North's guilt or innocence on 12 criminal
charges, including lying to Congress and the attorney general about
the Iran-Contra affair, misappropriating money, and conspiring to
defraud the Treasury.
   ``The North documents would seem to lead to some very troubling
conclusions about the use of foreign aid to persuade aid recipients
to provide foreign aid to the contras at a time when providing aid
to the contras was against official American government policy,''
Obey said.
   The congressman said he hoped to get answers from the State
Department ``anytime over the next two to three weeks.''
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee sources told The Washington
Post Wednesday that the committee probably would delay voting on
the nomination of John Negroponte as U.S. ambassador to Mexico
until questions raised by the North trial were resolved.
   Negroponte, who was U.S. ambassador to Honduras in 1985,
delivered a message from Reagan to Honduran President Roberto Suazo
Cordova that was part of the incentive plan. Negroponte also
attended a March 1985 meeting between then-Vice President Bush and
Suazo that White House documents described as part of the plan.
   The Post reported in its Thursday editions that Senate sources
said they doubted Negroponte's nomination was in danger, but said
Democrats on the panel agreed to informally postpone the vote to
elicit the administration's cooperation shedding light on the
Honduran deal.

   Police said they nailed a suspect in a series of
manicure-salon holdups after a victim fingered him.
   Richard A. Cobbs, 25, was suspected in the gunpoint robberies of
about 10 Lexington Avenue salons that netted about $5,000 in cash
and goods during the past few weeks, police said.
   He was arrested Wednesday after a woman whose salon had been
robbed spotted him on Lexington Avenue and called police.
   ``Our guys were right around the corner,'' said Lt. Donald
DeBellis, commander of the Manhattan Robbery Squad.
   Cobbs was unarmed and gave no resistance. Several salon holdup
victims identified him in lineups, and he was arrested on charges
of robbery, police said.

<TEXT>
   President Desmond Hoyte has rejected
allegations by Poland's Lech Walesa that his socialist government
has persecuted union leaders and clergy during a strike called to
protest austerity measures.
   Hoyte said in a telegram to Walesa that the Solidarity trade
union leader had been ``the victim of a cruel hoax or serious
misrepresentation'' about the bitter, monthlong strike by workers
in this South American nation's state-run sugar and bauxite
industries.
   ``I find your telex very puzzling. Government is not aware of
any trade union leaders or priests being repressed in this
country,'' Hoyte said in Tuesday's message.
   He asked Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace laureate, for more
information about his allegations.
   Walesa had sent Hoyte a telex Friday calling for negotiations
with the strikers and asking him to ``stop the repression against
the union leaders and the priests who are with them.''
   The strike is to protest austerity measures adopted under
provisions of a $115 million aid package from the International
Monetary Fund.
   Protesters have burned government buildings and firebombed a
school and two rural courts during nationwide demonstrations in
which police have arrested about 100 people.
   Hoyte said in a May Day speech that he doubted if Walesa
understood English, the language spoken in Guyan, or could find the
country on a map.

<TEXT>
   About 130,000 civilians fled their
homes in the countryside last year to escape fighting between the
military and Communist guerrillas, the International Committee of
the Red Cross says.
   Thierry Tribolet, Red Cross relief department chief, said
Wednesday that his organization helped 24,000 families in at least
12 of country's 73 provinces last year.
   He said Mindanao, the archipelago nation's second largest
island, accounted for about 100,000 evacuees, with the rest on
Luzon and in the central Visayas island chain.
   Field reports indicate most of the civilians flee when the
military launches operations to flush out communist New People's
Army guerrillas, Tribolet said.
   The military often forces civilians to move out to prevent them
from feeding and sheltering insurgents and to isolate the rebels
from the rural population, their main source of support and
recruits.

   International financier Adnan M. Khashoggi is
being dropped as a trustee of The American University in
Washington, D.C., according to university president Dr. Richard
Berendzen.
   Khashoggi, who is jailed in Switzerland for extradition to the
United States, pledged $5 million in 1984 to build the university's
new sports and convocation center, which was named in his honor.
   But Khashoggi's failure to attend board meetings, rather than
the arrest, which caused the board to decide to drop him, Berendzen
said.
   Khashoggi had only attended one trustees' meeting since being
named to the board in 1983, and stayed a total of about 30 minutes,
he said.
   ``He may not even be aware he is on the board,'' Berendzen said.
``I wouldn't be surprised about that.''
   He said the board's executive committee decided early last month
not to nominate Khashoggi for a third term.
   ``We have no address for him,'' Berendzen said. ``We can't send
him any material. We can't even tell him when the meetings are.''
   Khashoggi, a native of Saudi Arabia, was indicted on charges of
fraud and obstruction of justice by a New York City grand jury. He
is charged with helping former Phillippine President Ferdinand
Marcos illegally remove millions of dollars from the Phillippines
to buy paintings and real estate in New York.

<TEXT>
   Don't sell your palladium futures just yet. Cold
fusion is not dead.
   Physicists nearly succeeded this week in sending cold fusion
from the laboratory to the library (file under: science fiction).
   At an American Physical Society meeting in Baltimore, they
announced in a chorus that they had failed to confirm the
University of Utah's claims of fusion in a jar.
   The Utah chemists had misinterpreted their data, the physicists
said. That was putting it charitably.
   To which University of Utah Vice President John Brophy
responded: What about the positive results from Stanford, Texas A&amp;M
and Case Western Reserve universities?
   Researchers at those institutions said Wednesday they are still
getting positive results. Something is going on. They are hesitant
to call it fusion. But they can't make it go away.
   ``There are plenty of positive results to talk about,'' said
Charles Martin of Texas A&amp;M.
   ``We stand convinced,'' said Robert Huggins at Stanford. ``We
don't see anything wrong with our experiments. And we would be glad
to have other people replicate it under identical circumstances.''
   At Case Western, Uziel Landau revised his figures slightly, but
his results remain positive. On Friday, he said his device was
producing 8 percent to 30 percent more energy than was going into
it. Wednesday he said the energy output was 10 percent over the
input.
   The Utah scientists' claim is far more extravagant. They say
they are getting 10 times as much energy out as they are putting
in, according to Brophy.
   Some of the strongest of this week's attacks on the Utah
research came from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Yet a lone physicist there is holding on tight to his theory
explaining how fusion is possible in the Utah experiment.
   ``I'm not withdrawing my theory,'' Peter Hagelstein said
Wednesday through a spokesman.
   ``He put forth his theory on the basis that the Pons-Fleischmann
experiment had some validity,'' said the spokesman, Eugene Mallove.
   The chemists' chance to make their case comes Monday night, at a
meeting in Los Angeles of the Electrochemical Society. The Stanford
and Texas A&amp;M groups will be there. That could be
make-it-or-break-it for cold fusion.
   Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of
the University of Southampton in England, who kicked off the fusion
sweepstakes with a press conference on March 23, will be there.
   They claim to generate energy with palladium and platinum
electrodes dipped in a beaker of so-called heavy water. It is made
of oxygen and deuterium, a form of hydrogen with a neutron in the
nucleus.
   Unlike the meeting of the physicists, the electrochemists'
meeting will be closed to the press, according to tradition, said
V.H. Branneky, the executive director of the Electrochemical
Society.
   All the confusion could be erased if Pons and Fleischmann would
reveal the details of their experiment, which they have not done.
   ``In terms of the original experiment, there's no reason not to
release all the information they know,'' said Brophy. ``If there
were confirmation, they wouldn't be taking all this guff.''
   On the other hand, they probably will not write up details of
their work until June, Brophy said. ``Their choice at this time is
to get additional data.''
   The worldwide swell of excitement over cold fusion recalls the
recent excitement over high-temperature superconductivity, with one
important difference.
   All of the important findings in the superconductivity scramble
were confirmed within days at laboratories around the world. That
has not been the case with cold fusion.
   Science magazine this week recalled a 1972 incident in which
three University of Utah scientists claimed to have invented an
X-ray laser. Most other labs that tried couldn't reproduce the
results. But a few did.
   Ultimately, said Science, the Utah researchers were proven
wrong. The disproven results were referred to as the ``Utah
effect.''
   ``If cold fusion fizzles,'' said Science, ``the Utah effect will
have struck again.''

   Police said they found the body of an infant
Wednesday night in their search for a missing 6-week-old girl whose
reported abduction last week mirrored the disappearance of her
sister in 1986.
   The body was in a plastic garbage bag in a metal trash bin near
an old lock and dam across the Mississippi River from this
community, said St. Charles, Mo., County Sheriff Ed Uebinger.
   A fisherman had noticed someone ``acting a little bit strange,''
put something into the garbage can, Uebinger said.
   The sheriff said he did not know whether the baby was 6-week-old
Heather Sims of Alton, who was reported abducted last Saturday by
her mother, Paula Sims. An autopsy was planned for Thursday morning.
   Alton police said Heather's father, Robert Sims, called police
saying he had learned of the discovery from a TV news report, said
Sgt. Billy Lawrence. ``He asked when someone was going to come and
talk to him,'' Lawrence said.
   Robert and Paula Sims told police a masked man approached Mrs.
Sims while she was taking out the trash Saturday. The man forced
her back into the home, knocked her unconscious and took the baby,
the couple told police.
   The reported circumstances of Heather's disappearance are
strikingly similar to the June 1986 disappearance of Loralei Sims,
the couple's first child. The couple reported an armed intruder
entered their former home in Brighton and took the 13-day-old
infant.
   A week later, the remains of an infant believed to have been
Loralei were found near that home. The cause of death was not
determined.
   During their investigation into the 1986 case, investigators
conducted complete background studies of the parents and never
found anything, said Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom.
   The couple cooperated in extensive interviews at that time,
Yocom said.
   ``We looked at everything. We found no history of mental
problems, no children by a prior marriage, no insurance _
nothing,'' he said.
   In the 1986 case, the family was never contacted by anyone
claiming to have abducted the child and never had a ransom demand,
Yocom said.
   ``We were prepared for it, but we never got a note or a call,''
he said.
   A search Tuesday of property the parents owned in rural Brighton
proved fruitless. On Wednesday, Sgt. Rick McCain, Alton's chief of
detectives, said there were new and encouraging leads in the case,
but declined to discuss them.

   Thousands of students swept past police lines and
into Tiananmen Square on Thursday in a march for freedom and
democracy celebrating the 70th anniversary of the first student
movement in China.
   Policemen who had ringed the vast expanse were unable to hold
back the several thousand students from at least eight universities
in the city's northeast who surged into the square, the symbolic
center of power in China.
   A crowd of about 1,000 onlookers also ran into the square,
climbing on the monument to revolutionary heroes that has been a
focal point of pro-democracy protests launched by students more
than two weeks ago.
   Another 4,000 students from 10 Beijing universities and five
groups from out-of-town schools were heading to the square from the
west. They had left campuses at 8:30 a.m. with a burst of
firecrackers and the bang of a gong.
   The students had said Tuesday they would march unless the
country's Communist leaders recognized their independent student
organization. On Wednesday, the government refused and said the
square would be closed Thursday.
   A group of 300 journalists meanwhile held a protest at the
official Xinhua News Agency, calling for a free press, and some of
them broke away to join the student march, carrying banners calling
for press freedoms.
   ``A closed press does not contribute to stability,'' said one
banner.
   As they marched through streets lined by thousands of cheering
workers, the students met less police resistance than in previous
marches.
   The students carried dozens of red and white banners calling for
a free press and democratic reforms. Some wore headbands saying,
``Mom, I'm not wrong.''
   Most students met little police resistance when, at about 9:30
a.m., they broke through the first line of several hundred police
blocking the street.
   But several thousand students from Beijing Normal College
overcame strong resistance from several hundred police by shoving
their way through, as surrounding crowds yelled ``Let them
through!'' and ``Hurry up!''
   Students from the People's University pushed a three-wheeled
cart holding a loudspeaker that blared slogans. They also carried a
large red banner painted with a bright green dragon and the words
``science, democracy, freedom and human rights'' in each corner.
   In contrast to last week's march on Tiananmen Square, when
students were angered by the government's opposition to their
demands for democracy and freedom, Thursday's march commemorating
the anniversary of the 1919 May Fourth student movement had an air
of defiant celebration.
   Last Thursday, about 150,000 students and supporters had staged
a 20-mile march through the square and the capital's streets.
   ``Today is a holiday, and we are here to remember May Fourth,''
said one student.
   Thousands of workers had defied government warnings that they
would be fired if they attended the march, said one government
employee.
   ``But this is the first time in 40 years such a big movement for
democracy has occurred. I'll just show up at work tomorrow and see
what happens,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   People leaned out of bus windows and pushed into the crowds to
snatch leaflets handed out by the students. The leaflets explained
the students' goals and called on all sections of society to arise.
   ``If this develops, I think China has hope,'' said one bystander.
   At one corner, crowds jeered as a police loudspeaker said
repeatedly: ``Please, everybody, obey the people's police. Uphold
traffic order. Students who uphold the party and socialism please
return to school.''
   Student leaders said they expected more than 40 universities
around Beijing to join in the march.
   Since April 15, when the current demonstrations began, students
have successfully marched to the square on five different occasions.
   Students also have boycotted classes the past two weeks in the
largest protest the Chinese Communist authorities have faced in
their 40 years of rule.
   Student leaders participating in Thursday's march said they were
considering returning to class on May 8.
   Police had closed off the central square early Thursday,
clearing all pedestrians off the vast 100-acre plaza.
   About 2,000 international finance officials and bankers gathered
at the Great Hall of the People, on the western side of the square,
Thursday morning for the opening of the annual meeting of Asian
Development Bank.
   ``They tried to close it (the square) on April 22, and look what
happened then,'' Beijing Normal University student leader Wu'er
Kaixi said Wednesday.
   Police presence has been heavy at previous demonstrations, but
police are unarmed and have made only minimal efforts to stop the
marchers.
   Marches were reportedly planned in Shanghai, Tianjin and other
cities. About 60 journalists from state-run newspapers also said
they planned a rally outside the gates of the official Xinhua News
Agency.
   The tightly controlled press has barely covered the
demonstrations and has expressed the government line that the
independent student unions formed by the activists are illegal.
   On Wednesday, Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang, in a major
speech to mark the May Fourth Movement, called for stability.
   ``Haven't we had enough social turmoil? Since 1849, China has
had only about 20 years of stability,'' he said.

<HEAD>Some In Congress Look To Judges To Provide Cover For Pay Raises</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some members of Congress are clearly curious
whether providing a pay raise for federal judges will supply enough
political cover to vote one for themselves as well.
   That was the one clear lesson on Wednesday when William H.
Rehnquist became the first chief justice to testify before Congress
in 50 years. Rehnquist, who makes $115,000 a year, appealed for 30
percent pay raises and annual cost-of-living increases for himself
and all federal judges.
   He appeared before a veritable hotbed of support for the
controversial idea of boosting top federal pay: the House Committee
on Post Office and Civil Service.
   Among members of the committee, the 51 percent pay raise lost by
just 12-9 on Feb. 7. In the House as a whole that day, that
increase _ for Congress, the judges and top executive branch
officials _ was defeated 380-48.
   ``We've felt very lonely on this issue,'' said Rep. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y., who voted for the pay raise. ``Those of us in
this branch are taking all the heat.''
   Chairman William Ford, D-Mich., who also voted for the pay
raise, ended the session with special thanks to Rehnquist. ``You
give us credibility in a way that almost no one else could,'' Ford
said.
   Before then, four members _ Ackerman and three who voted against
the raise, Connie Morella, R-Md.; Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.,; and
Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio _ all asked whether, in proposing a judges'
raise, Rehnquist was advocating that the judges be treated
differently from their traditional pay equals in Congress and the
top executive offices.
   First, the chief justice said he had no position.
   But by the time the question was asked a fourth time, Rehnquist
said that just as good a case had been made for raises in Congress
and the executive as for judges. He said it was well within the
bounds of propriety for them to get 30 percent raises as well.
   It fell to Ackerman to make the point explicitly: ``The feeling
here is that if there's ever going to be a pay raise for the
legislative branch, we have to stay coupled with the judiciary.''
   So they threw him every argument against the raise that they had
heard to see how good his defenses sounded.
   What about voters who say that officials sought their offices
voluntarily knowing the salary in advance?
   Rehnquist: yes, but we didn't know that inflation would eat away
at our purchasing power.
   Judicial leaders predicted judges would quit if the raise was
defeated but they haven't; is that danger real?
   Rehnquist: more and more have quit in recent years, but ``even
now not a major or even a large minor percentage of the judges.''
   And the big one, as stated by Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., one of
several who made this point:
   ``A $10,000-a-year job or a $12,000-a-year job in Morgan County,
Ind., would be considered the job of a lifetime. The people there
who make those salaries can't understand how you can't get by on
$89,500.'' That is the salary of a federal district judge.
   Rehnquist replied, ``I have no good answer.'' But he added, ``I
never felt I wanted to go to a doctor who made no more than I did,
I wanted to go to a good doctor.''
   Other committee members kept touching on this argument. At
another point, Rehnquist responded: ``You want the best doctor,
don't you want the best judge?''
   Rehnquist said he worried that partners in big city law firms _
the highest paid lawyers in America _ were no longer coming onto
the bench. But then he added this observation:
   ``There's always going to be a large number of partners in big
city law firm who don't want to be federal judges, because they
don't want to make the financial sacrifices. If you're interested
in money and you now make $250,000, if the district judge's pay
goes from $89,500 to $115,000, it isn't going to influence you in
the least,'' Rehnquist said. ``Our pay raise is not going to affect
that.
   ``To get the very best, you have to offer not salaries that are
competitive with private practice but something that lets them live
a reasonably comfortable life and educate their kids.''
   But Rehnquist acknowledged getting mail on that point, including
a letter ``from someone earning $25,000 to $30,000 with a mortgage
who wanted to educate their kids too and wanted to know why I
wanted $150,000.''
   At the end, it was anybody's guess how many members thought
Rehnquist's explanations would satisfy their constituents and
provide political cover for a congressional raise.
   But all morning, no one mentioned an argument available to
members of Congress: unlike judges, who get the same pay, they have
to maintain two homes and commute between them.

<HEAD>Bush Rules Out Talks With Soviets Over Short-Range Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenneth L. Adelman, who was the Reagan
administration's arms control director, says the United States
should never negotiate a reduction in short-range nuclear missiles
with the Soviet Union.
   ``For two reasons,'' Adelman said Wednesday in an interview.
``They have been an essential element in deterrence since the early
1960s. No. 2, there is no way to verify whether the missiles will
have nuclear or conventional or chemical munitions.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has demanded that the United
States negotiate reductions in the missiles with the Soviet Union.
Kohl is also resisting U.S. and British efforts to more than triple
the range of NATO's Lance missiles to about 250 miles.
   But Bush on Wednesday ruled out negotiations with the Soviets on
short-range nuclear missiles. The White House put the best face on
the dispute by calling it a sign of NATO's vitality.
   Adelman, who was the U.S. arms control director from 1983 to
1987, said the Bush administration should propose to Kohl that the
missiles be modernized and then the U.S. arsenal of short-range
weapons could be reduced by about 1,000 from its current level of
4,500.
   But Adelman, who was an enthusiastic supporter of the 1987
treaty to ban U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles,
said the United States should never negotiate to reduce or _
another Kohl goal _ to eliminate the Lances.
   ``Never,'' Adelman said. ``Never under any circumstance. It is
unwise and it's unverifiable.''
   He said the United States would comply with a ban on short-range
missiles. But, Adelman said, ``we don't always know if the Soviets
would comply'' and it is impossible to distinguish between nuclear
and non-nuclear tactical missiles.
   Paul H. Nitze, a senior adviser on arms control in the Reagan
administration, told The New York Times this week that President
Bush was making a mistake in refusing to open talks with the
Soviets on short-range nuclear missiles.
   Nitze said such negotiations would provide an opportunity to
eliminate a large Soviet advantage.
   Adelman said he disagreed, but added ``there is nothing wrong in
his speaking out'' on the subject.
   Since leaving his post Adelman has been writing, teaching and
serving as vice president of the Institute for Contemporary
Studies, a public policy research group in San Francisco.
   With Bush's summit meeting with 15 allied leaders looming at
month's end, efforts by Norway and Canada to broker a compromise
did not meet with immediate success. Through his spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, the president insisted the Lance missiles must be
upgraded to deter Soviet attack.
   Bush told visiting Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland that ``entering into arms control negotiations on
short-range nuclear forces with the Soviet Union would be a
mistake,'' Fitzwater said.
   After a one-hour session in the Oval Office, Mrs. Brundtland
stressed a need to find ``common ground'' with Kohl.
   Canada, meanwhile, approached NATO members with a compromise
that called for negotiations with the Soviets on short-range
nuclear weapons with the understanding all Lances would not be
uprooted and the Warsaw Pact's edge in conventional forces would be
erased. The deal would permit modernizing the missiles first.
   Mrs. Brundtland told reporters in a White House driveway that a
solution would be found before the May 29-30 summit or at least
when the leaders are gathered in Brussels.
   But Fitzwater was dubious. ``We will continue to discuss it,''
he said of the missile dispute, ``but we are very firm in our
position.''
   On Capitol Hill, members of Congress warned that the United
States might reconsider keeping troops in Europe if West Germany
persisted in pushing for removal of the Lances.
   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee told Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney they had serious concerns about the West
German position.
   ``I think if the West German people have come to the conclusion
they can place more faith and reliance on Mr. Gorbachev's words and
assurances than they can upon sound NATO strategy, than it would be
very difficult for me to continue to commit the size of the forces
we have in Europe under those circumstances,'' said Sen. William
Cohen, R-Maine.
   Another Republican, Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, said that
if the missiles were eliminated and the 324,000 U.S. military
personnel in Germany were placed at risk, the administration's
policy should be ``that a substantial percentage of troops be
brought home and we allow West Germany greater responsibility of
their defense.''
   Cheney, who had come to Capitol Hill to discuss the fiscal 1990
defense budget, cautioned against ``overdramatizing the nature of
the current differences'' within NATO.
   But Cheney said that if a NATO consensus called for no
short-range missiles, ``I as secretary of defense would have
something of a stomach ache.''

<HEAD>Common Cause Asks Independent Counsel to Investigate Gingrich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public affairs lobbying group that joined
Rep. Newt Gingrich last year in asking the House ethics committee
to investigate Speaker Jim Wright now is asking for an outside
counsel to investigate Gingrich.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the lobbying group Common Cause,
made the request for an independent counsel in a letter Wednesday
to Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the committee.
   ``The use of outside counsel helps ensure that the results of an
inquiry are credible to, and accepted by, the public,'' Wertheimer
said.
   Gingrich, R-Ga., charged that Common Cause, usually associated
with liberal causes, is trying to get back in the good graces of
Democrats who were upset when the group helped bring about
investigation of Wright, D-Texas.
   ``There are 15 to 20 members who have had pretty powerful
allegations of real scandals made against them in the press and I'm
in the middle of being smeared,'' Gingrich said. ``I find it
bizarre that Common Cause would jump past those scandals and ask
for an investigation of the guy who's being smeared, the
whistleblower.''
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., filed a formal complaint with the
committee last month accusing Gingrich of 10 apparent violations of
House rules in the operation of a limited partnership set up to
promote ``Window of Opportunity,'' a book written in 1984 by
Gingrich, his wife, Marianne Gingrich, and David Drake.
   According to the allegations, the 21 partners who put up $5,000
each in the book ended up with a tax writeoff because the publisher
lost money.
   Mrs. Gingrich was paid $11,500 for her work as the controlling
general partner. She also was given a 2 percent ownership interest
in the organization, although she did not invest any of her own
money.
   While he had no direct financial stake in the partnership,
Gingrich was paid $1,320 in expenses by the partnership when he
traveled to promote the book, and he and his wife each have
received $12,018 in royalties.

<HEAD>Third World Has Market Potential, but Also Plenty of Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain sales to the Soviet Union and Japan
capture attention because of the countries and quantities involved,
but an Agriculture Department report says the Third World offers
strong export potential as well.
   Unlike the Soviet Union and Japan, however, the Third World
countries have little money to spend for food to keep pace with
expanding populations.
   These are 55 ``less-developed countries'' listed by the United
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. Most have food
shortfalls that are made up by imports, often in the form of aid
from richer nations.
   Gregory Gajewski and Ray Nightingale of the department's
Economic Research Service say U.S. farmers will have to rely mainly
on larger exports in order to handle increased production of cereal
grains. And policy changes by the poorer nations themselves could
help create greater demand.
   The 55 countries on the FAO's less-developed list currently
``are players in international cereals markets, but only on
concessional terms,'' the two economists said in the May issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``Yet about 1.9 billion people live
in these countries, accounting for about two-fifths of the world's
population.''
   But these countries are poor, and many have stagnant economies,
the report said. In addition, some are overburdened with
international debt that saps their ability to grow and import
agricultural commodities.
   ``Other have government regulations that depress prices paid to
local farmers, so that urban consumers may benefit from lower food
prices,'' the report said. ``These regulations hinder the
development of a market-oriented farm economy, and cut farmers'
incentives to produce.''
   Gajeweski and Nightingale said there is historical evidence that
farm-led development can boost a poor country's imports of
agricultural commodities.
   For example, they said, South Korea now imports more food each
year from the United States than it ever received in U.S. food aid.
Investment in rural infrastructure _ roads, dams, irrigation
projects _ tends to boost incomes across the board in developing
countries.
   ``As incomes rise, people increase their demands for better
food, including meats and processed products,'' the report said.
``Increased meat demand consequently leads to greater demand for
feed grains. So, on balance, demand for agricultural imports
rises.''
   Gajewski and Nightingale said that food aid increases labor's
diet and productivity, and has ``had a positive influence on
economic growth'' in some countries.
   ``But food aid can hamper a recipient country's long-term
prospects if it is not linked to policy changes,'' they said.
``Massive inflows of free or subsidized food weaken domestic farm
prices and reduce local farmers' incentives.''
   Despite last year's drought in North America, global food
production is ``not expected to be the long-term problem,'' the
report said. But the distribution of food has been and will
continue to be the major concern.
   Looking at some of the recent trouble spots, the report said
that on the basis of per capita food supplies, shortfalls are most
pronounced in Jamaica, Costa Rica, Tunisia, Cape Verde, Swaziland
and Liberia.
   ``In contrast, eight countries that once had serious shortfalls
now have sufficient domestic production, or are expected to import
enough cereals to maintain usual consumption without depleting
(grain inventories),'' the report said. ``These countries are
Burkina Faso, Chad, Gambia, Mali, Niger, Sudan, Uganda and Zambia.''

   A group of farm state lawmakers has proposed
legislation to establish a $60 million soybean research and
promotion program financed by a levy on domestic soybean production.
   The proposal, which was developed by the American Soybean
Association, would provide for a nationwide ``checkoff'' similar to
those imposed on other commodities, including dairy, pork and beef
producers.
   Money from the proposed mandatory assessment would go to pay for
farmer-run programs to expand exports, develop new uses for
soybeans and promote soybean products through a coordinated
national advertising campaign.
   The legislation calls for the overall program to be administered
by a system of state and national boards made up of soybean
producers.
   ``This program is and will be farmer-bred, farmer-fed and
farmer-led,'' James Lee Adams, of Camilla, Ga., president of the
American Soybean Association, said Wednesday.
   At a news conference, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said the
legislation would give ``American soybean farmers a war chest of
their own'' to combat promotional and research efforts of foreign
competitors, including Brazilian soybean producers and Malaysian
palm oil growers.
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said the goal of the legislation
was to ``restore America as the world's pre-eminent supplier'' of
soybeans.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the House Agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains, said lawmakers
would act on the measure as ``quickly as feasible.''
   Currently, 26 states have soybean promotion programs that
generate about $14 million to $15 million in total, but Adams said
a ``patchwork'' approach of voluntary assessments was inadequate
when ``our competitors have begun to outsell and outinvest us.''
   The proposed rate of assessment would be one-half percent of the
net market value of soybeans sold by a farmer _ 50 cents for every
$100 in sales. Half the collections would go to state programs.
   If the legislation is approved by Congress, the assessment would
be implemented and then a producer referendum would be held in 18

Current state checkoffs would be reinstituted if producers reject
the national assessment.

<HEAD>San Diegans Appeal America's Cup Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The San Diego Yacht Club asked a state appeals
court Wednesday to overturn a judge's ruling that awarded the
America's Cup to a New Zealand boating club after September's
mismatched yacht race off San Diego.
   The West Coast sailors said that the ruling March 28 by state
Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick was improper because the
judge invented a rule that didn't exist and illegally ordered the
cup forfeited.
   The judge said the San Diego Yacht Club had ``violated the
spirit'' of the race by using a 60-foot catamaran to defend the cup
against the Mercury Bay Boating Club's single-hulled yacht, which
is about 90 feet long at the waterline.
   The judge called the contest, which the San Diegans won, ``a
gross mismatch'' and ordered the 138-year-old silver cup turned
over to the New Zealanders.
   Oral arguments before the state Supreme Court's appellate
division have not been scheduled yet. In their filing Wednesday,
the San Diegans pointed to Ciparick's phrase saying the boats
should be ``somewhat evenly matched.''
   They said there was no such provision in the ``Deed of Gift,'' a
document that sets the rules for America's Cup races.
   The San Diego club argued that the forfeiture was ``drastic and
unfair'' and asked the appeals court to reverse it.

   They come by the thousands, carrying red and
white banners, bullhorns, leaflets and a fatalism leading many to
sew their names inside their clothes for identification in case
they are hurt.
   They confront unarmed police, young men fresh from the
countryside, many of whom still wear the black cloth slippers of
China's peasantry.
   On their way, they meet the people of Beijing, who line the
streets and pile on top of walls to watch and cheer.
   Five times in the last two weeks, Chinese students demanding
democracy and a free press have set out from their universities on
the 10-mile march to the center of the city.
   Today, they did it again, protesting the government's refusal to
recognize and open a dialogue with their independent student
association.
   _ Just east of Communist Party headquarters, April 20, 3:30 a.m.:
   A thousand students are conducting a sit-in demonstration,
blocking predawn truck traffic on Beijing's biggest boulevard,
Changan Avenue.
   ``One-two, sit down, one-two sit down,'' the students yell at
their standing classmates surrounding them.
   A man sits on a three-wheeled cart doing a fast business selling
orange soda pop. Hundreds more onlookers on bicycles stretch off
into the distance. Some demonstrators doze against a tree.
   Two lines of about 300 police block access to the party
headquarters at Zhongnanhai, where several hundred other students
also are sitting in.
   A police loudspeaker broadcasts a warning but cannot cut through
the students' din.
   ``Rise, ye who refuse to be slaves,'' the students bellow,
singing their national anthem. The students pass cigarettes to each
other. One has some dumplings that he shares.
   Police reinforcements arrive. Another warning is broadcast.
   With war whoops and battle cries the security forces rush the
crowd, sending it fleeing down the boulevard. A dawdling female
student is set upon by several officers, who slap her with open
hands. One student's bicycle wheel apparently gets stuck. He is
kicked to the ground and beaten.
   ``Police don't hit students,'' the crowd chants. The lights of
the boulevard cast a pale shadow over the protesters faces. Eyes
widen with fear.
   _ The intersection of New Street and South Institute Road, April
21, midnight:
   ``Long live freedom, long live democracy,'' roars a crowd of
tens of thousands as it moves south, banners flapping in the
late-night wind. Eight miles to go to Tiananmen Square, the
symbolic political center of China.
   Five buses, packed with passengers, wait, cemented in place by
the wall-to-wall crowd.
   ``Students, we love you,'' a young man with the beginnings of a
beard yells from one bus window.
   Students from dozens of colleges file by, school flag presented
in the front. Departments also carry their own flags.
   The students hold hands as they walk, girls with girls and boys
with boys. A ring of young men, student activists, surrounds the
group, preventing outsiders from entering their ranks.
   ``We are afraid of plainclothes police,'' says a student. ``They
are the ones who cause trouble and push.''
   _ Beijing University, April 27, 9 a.m.:
   The young men with the red arm bands are worried. Students from
Qinghua University, a major science center up the road, have
apparently dropped out of the protest set to begin in minutes.
   ``We can't stop it now,'' says one of the organizers.
   Thousands of their classmates line the entrance of the
university.
   ``Open the road,'' yells one leader.
   Moving neatly into line, the crowd rolls through the gates.
Hundreds of local residents pack the street. Others hang from their
windows or squat on roofs, clapping and flashing the V-for-victory
sign.
   At the first intersection, the crowd roars. Qinghua has arrived,
led by a banner: Qinghua Ren (Men).
   _ The Xidan Intersection, central Beijing. April 27, 4:15 p.m.:
   The intersection, one of the busiest in the city, swarms with
people. Some balance on top of a movie billboard advertising the
film ``Crazy Love.'' Others sit in the trees. Still more gather on
the avenue, licking popsicles and leaning slightly on their
neighbors.
   Another line of police forms to stop the marchers.
   Workers appear in the crowd _ older men with harder features,
stronger, dressed in the blue cotton of the Chinese working class.
   ``Clear the way, police,'' chants one part of the crowd as it
surges toward the officers, who stand arm-in-arm blocking the way.
   Another part of the crowd picks up the chant; it too surges
forward. One woman is pushed to the ground and screams.
   The banners loom closer, further compressing the pack.
   A late afternoon sun bathes the crowd in white light.
   The smell of sweat and garlic whirl together. The crowd pushes
again and breaks through the police lines, sending the officers
scattering to the side.
   ``My shoes, my shoes,'' yells one policeman, hobbling around in
his black nylon socks.
   An elderly lady returns one shoe. The second is found by a
marching student.
   Red and white banners, for democracy and a freer China, flap by.

<HEAD>Punishment Must Be Certain Rather than Long, Drug Czar Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Certainty of punishment is more important than
severity of punishment in dealing with drug offenders, drug czar
William J. Bennett says.
   ``I am for severe penalties, particularly when a drug crime is
severe, but what you have to have is certain punishment,'' Bennett
said Wednesday. ``You shouldn't make certain punishment hostage to
severe punishment.
   ``It would be better in many situations to have everyone that's
convicted of drug use to go to jail for a week ... than to just get
a third of them going for six months,'' he said.
   Bennett made his comments to reporters after telling several
hundred members of the Washington Metropolitan Area Interreligious
Coalition that ``those guilty of drug offenses must believe that
punishment is inevitable.''
   ``As long as they don't, the deterrent effect of incarceration
is neutralized,'' he said.
   The trend in recent years has been toward longer sentences for
crimes, and Bennett denied later that he was calling for reduced
sentences for drug offenders, including what he termed so-called
casual users.
   But he cited the practice in Phoenix as an example of where
short sentences have the desired impact on those who break the law.
   In that city, police are arresting drug users, many of them
middle-class, and putting them ``in jail for a weekend, that's all,
just a weekend,'' he said. ``For a lot of middle-class users, that
is plenty of time. ... They are cured after one weekend in the
slammer.''
   Bennett's speech, an overview of his thinking as he compiles his
national drug control strategy _ a report on which is due in early
September _ also called for parents to be made more responsible,
legally, for their children's transgressions.
   He cited in this case the example of Toledo, Ohio, where
``parents are brought before the juvenile-justice court and made to
answer for the actions of their children through civil penalties.''
   ``This policy establishes the principle that parents ... must
bear responsibility for the behavior and the activities of minors
in their charge,'' Bennett said. ``Minors who are non-addicted
users must be taught early on that they cannot behave with
impunity, and parents who have effectively turned them loose must
learn why the social contract demands that they oversee and control
the implses of their children.''
   Asked later if that included jailing parents for offenses
committed by their children, Bennett said that should occur only in
``extreme cases.''
   Bennett acknowledged that the federal government was unlikely to
get involved in imposing such regulations as the weekend jailings
and the arrests of parents and said such actions would be for the
state and local governments to carry out.
   The issues were raised, he said, because local officials have
asked him repeatedly to disseminate whatever good ideas are being
tried out around the country to combat illegal drugs.
   Bennett's speech, made only hours after his wife gave birth to
their second son, also addressed rehabilitation of drug users and
offenders.
   ``We don't know as much as we'd like to about how to treat drug
use, and sadly, many of our profoundly good-spirited efforts at
treatment have failed to pan out,'' he said. ``But what we do know
is this: successful programs and treatment almost always force the
addict to confront and internalize the fact of his addiction.''
   Bennett said it may take confrontation, primarily from the
family, for a drug user to recognize that ``there will be dire
consequences for him'' if he fails to end his addiction.
   But he said he realizes that ``rehabilitation is the wrong term
to use'' for many drug offenders, because the addict never had a
normal home life to begin with, and good habits must be instilled
for the first time.

   Passenger complaints against the nation's
airlines continued to decline last month, according to the
Department of Transportation.
   The department, in its monthly Air Travel Consumer Report
released Wednesday, listed the most complaints against Pan
American, Trans World and Hawaiian airlines.
   The department said Pan American World Airways received 7.58
complaints per 100,000 passengers in April, Trans World Airlines
6.91 and Hawaiian Airlines 6.53. All were well below last year's
figures for each airline.
   Overall, complaints received by the department against airlines
declined from 970 in March to 933 in April. There were 2,100 in
April 1988.
   The most dissatisfaction a year ago was reported against
Continental Airlines, with 14.94 per 100,000 passengers, and
Eastern Airlines, with 12.48. Both airlines are owned by Texas Air
Corp. Eastern, which has shut down most of its operations because
of a strike, received 1.83 complaints per 100,000 passengers last
month, and Continental 3.91.
   The 12 largest carriers reported that 72.3 percent of their
flights operated on time in March, the latest month for which
statistics were available. The February figure was 72.4 percent.
Eastern was not included in the latest report because of the
strike, the department said.
   Mishandled baggage reports filed against the carriers in March
increased from 7.36 per 1,000 passengers in February to 7.53 in
March, the report said.

<HEAD>18-Year-Old Argues Before the State's highest Court</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The plaintiff serving as his own counsel before
the state Supreme Judicial Court was younger than most attorneys:
He's 18.
   Harvard freshman Josh Gerstein, believed to be the youngest
person to argue before the state's highest court, appeared
Wednesday to protest what he says was a violation of the state's
Open Meeting Law.
   Gerstein contended the Weston School Committee violated the law
when it hired a superintendent in 1988.
   Gerstein said he spent more than 100 hours preparing for the
case. He submitted a 20-page brief. His arguments before five
jurists took only five minutes, but he said he was ``a lot more
nervous'' than when he argued the case before a lower court last
year.
   ``It's an interesting issue _ it's dealing with how much access
the public has to government,'' Gerstein told reporters after the
hearing.
   He said he was forced to skip Russian class.
   After Gerstein filed his complaint in 1988, he was joined by the
Middlesex County district attorney's office. An attorney from the
office also argued on behalf of the complaint Wednesday.
   Gerstein was a senior at Weston High School when he first
protested what he saw as insufficient student input in the
selection of a superintendent.
   Weston school officials contend they were entitled to close
three rounds of screening, including interviews, to the public.
   Gerstein and the district attorney say the law only allows the
first round of interviews to be closed.
   Gerstein said he has nothing against the superintendent chosen
by the committee, Meredith Jones. But he said he did not know if
she was more or less qualified than the other 100 original
candidates since students were excluded.
   A ruling is expected within four months.
   Despite his performance Wednesday, Gerstein said he does not
plan a career in law. He is majoring in government and wants to be
a journalist.

<HEAD>EPA: No Assurance Imported Food is Pesticide-Free</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says it
can't assure that pesticides banned in the United States won't show
up on imported food.
   The head of EPA's division on pesticides and toxic substances
said Wednesday that pesticide residue on imported food could be a
huge problem.
   ``There is no simple way of finding out the pesticide usage of
countries exporting food to the United States,'' said Victor Kim.
   Kim's comments came during a hearing of the House subcommittee
on environment, energy and natural resources which has jurisdiction
over the EPA.
   Rep. Mike Synar, R-Okla., chairman of the subcommittee, blasted
the EPA for not having a better system for informing foreign
countries about the dangers of pesticides they buy from American
companies.
   ``The United States carries an environmental responsibility and
a moral obligation to ensure that foreign governments through the
world are provided with the best information on, assistance with
and, if necessary, protection from unsafe pesticides,'' said Synar.
   ``To date, the EPA has failed miserably in fulfilling this
responsibility.''
   He said the agency also has failed to do its job in protecting
the American food supply by informing agencies like the Agriculture
Department that countries selling food to the United States use
pesticides banned here.
   Synar displayed memos from Agriculture Department inspectors
about two shipments of Honduran beef that were contaminated with
chlordane, a chemical believed to cause cancer.
   ``Our reports show that chlordane is made only in the United
States,'' said Synar, noting, however, that it is not allowed to be
sold here as pesticide.
   Most of the beef in the shipments was sold to grocery stores,
ground up and purchased by consumers before it was discovered.
   Under questioning from Synar, EPA officials admitted that they
haven't followed their own suggestions for helping other countries
understand better the dangers of pesticides made in the United
States.
   Linda Fisher, EPA assistant administrator for policy, planning
and evaluation, said the agency was aware that more had to be done.
   But when presented with an internal EPA memo dated April 17,
1987 outlining improvements that should be made, she said none of
the recommendations had been followed.
   She assured Synar the EPA would act soon on the recommendations
and those of international negotiators trying to establish a
worldwide policy for pesticide use.
   According to a report from the General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, the EPA doesn't have any procedures
for deciding when to notify foreign countries about pesticides that
the United States has decided are dangerous to human health.
   The report also said EPA doesn't have any standards for
determining when actions taken against pesticides in this country
are significant enough to warn another nation.
   ``The agency is considering improvements to its present
procedures, including those recommended by GAO,'' said Fisher.
   Under U.S. law, pesticides that are banned or unregistered
domestically can be sold abroad if foreign buyers provide a
statement saying they understand that the product is outlawed in
the United States.

<HEAD>Administration Defuses Beef Dispute with Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration issued a stern warning
to Japan on fair trade at the same time that it eased what had
threatened to become a full-blown trade war with Europe.
   The European agreement, announced late Wednesday, concerned
American beef containing growth hormones. U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills called the partial settlement with the 12-nation
European Community ``a positive step toward de-escalating'' the
dispute between the United States and its largest trading partner.
   In a separate trade dispute involving telecommunications, Mrs.
Hills released a target list of Japanese products which could face
100 percent duties unless Japan does more to open its market for
car telephones and business radios to American companies.
   The threatened tariffs would effectively double the price of the
Japanese products. Included in the proposed list are some of the
most popular Japanese electronic products including color
televisions, video recorders and photocopying machines.
   The agreement with the EC will affect about 15 percent of the
$96 million in annual U.S. beef sales to Europe. The other 85
percent of the market will remain closed, pending further
negotiations, U.S. officials said in announcing the settlement.
   The agreement follows the recommendations of a task force of
officials from both sides.
   Under the agreement, U.S. beef producers who wish to export beef
not treated with growth hormones to Europe will be allowed to do so.
   This partial resolution will cover high quality grades of beef
being shipped to Europe, but will not cover the other 85 percent of
beef trade which includes so-called ``variety meats'' such as
livers, tongues and kidneys.
   In return for this action, Mrs. Hills said, the United States
will reduce the retaliatory tariffs imposed by America against
imports from the European Community.
   The tariffs, which took effect on Jan. 1, covered boneless beef,
ham, prepared tomatoes, tomato sauce, instant coffee, fruit juices,
fermented alcoholic beverages and pet food.
   Those 100 percent tariffs, which covered $96 million in European
food shipments to America, will be reduced by the amount of
American beef which is allowed in under the new agreement, Mrs.
Hills said.
   Mrs. Hills said that the task force studying the situation will
continue searching for ways to include more American beef and will
report back before June 15.
   U.S. officials have insisted that there is nothing harmful about
the hormones being used to fatten beef. They contend that the
European action was an illegal trade barrier which was masquerading
as a health issue.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said that while the U.S.
position was unchanged on the health question, the administration
did not want to ``stand in the way of producers who are willing and
able to meet the EC's requirements'' for hormone-free beef.
   Under the agreement, American ranchers who want to export
hormone-free beef to Europe will have to meet a set of requirements
drawn up by European officials, who will also establish a
monitoring system to insure that the beef being shipped does not
contain hormones.
   Release of the target list of Japanese products facing possible
100 percent duties stems in large part from complaints by the
Motorola Co., the principal American maker car telephones and
business radios. It contends that it has been denied access to the
Japanese market, denying it potential sales of about $400 million a
year.
   A final list of products which could be subject to the higher
tariffs will be drawn up after a hearing scheduled for May 24. That
list will be selected from the broader one released on Wednesday.
   Mrs. Hills said the threatened American retaliation could be
avoided if the Japanese make meaningful concessions to end the
dispute.

<TEXT>
   Air Force inspectors have found cracks in the
wings of more than one-third of subsonic, single-engine attack
aircraft inspected since the problem was discovered last month, the
Pentagon says.
   As of late Wednesday, cracks had been discovered in 116 of 325
A-7D and K model aircraft inspected since the fleet was grounded,
said Air Force spokeswoman Maj. Donna Pastor. She said inspections
of the remaining 40 of the 365 planes were not yet completed.
   The first cracks in the trailing edges of the wings were
detected in mid-April during routine maintenance by the Air Force
National Guard at Tuscon, Ariz., International Airport, Pastor said.
   ``The Air Force Logistics Command has been doing sophisticated
tests because many of the cracks can't be seen by the eye,'' said
Pastor. ``They're very minute. The concern is if a crack exists at
takeoff, it has the potential of ... increasing and potentially
causing wing failure.''
   Aircraft with cracks will be repaired or modified by a team from
the Air National Guard's Sacramento, Calif.-based Air Logistics
Center, said Pastor. Those found to be clean have been promptly
returned to service, said Pastor.
   The A-7 Corsair II was originally designed for the U.S. Navy.
The one-seat A-7D model of the aircraft, designed for the Air Force
primarily for an air-to-surface attack role, has been in service
since December 1968. Production ended in December 1976.
   The A-7K model, a two-seat version of the A-7D, had been used in
combat operations and training.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition closed its
presidential campaign with some supporters predicting victory in
Sunday's vote over the handpicked candidate of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega _ or bloodshed.
   ``Count the votes or count the dead,'' read one of the
opposition coalition's signs Wednesday at a rally attended by
100,000 flag-waving people on Via Espana in downtown Panama City.
   President Bush, opposition candidates and others predict that
Noriega, the Defense Forces chief and Panama's de facto ruler, will
steal the elections. The government promises clean elections.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara said that if
the public will is denied through vote-rigging, ``Panamanians will
march in defense of liberty.''
   Never again, Endara said in reference to Noriega, ``will the
will of one man be above the will of the Panamanian people.''
   The opposition candidates say there is no hope of democracy in
Panama as long as Noriega, indicted in Florida last year on charges
of drug smuggling and money laundering, remains in power. Noriega
has denied the charges.
   Opposition supporters snake-danced through the crowd Wednesday
night with a black coffin pasted with a smiling picture of Noriega
and a pineapple attached atop. ``Pineapple face,'' a derogatory
name the opposition uses for Noriega, refers to his rough
complexion.
   The pro-government coalition closes its presidential campaign
tonight with a rally. Its ticket is headed by Carlos Duque Jaen, a
close business associate of Noriega.
   The central issue of the campaign has been Noriega, and not
Panama's protracted economic and social problems.
   The opposition contends government workers, representing about
20 percent of the labor force, are being pressured by Noriega
forces to attend the rally tonight and that the government will
truck thousands into the capital to swell the ranks.
   On Sunday, voters will choose a president, two vice presidents,
67 national legislators and 510 precinct representatives.
   Panama has about 2.2 million people and about 1.2 million
registered voters. At a news conference Wednesday, second
opposition vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford said Sunday's
vote ``is the last peaceful opportunity for change.''
   Said first vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon,
``There are thousands here who have never known liberty but are
here to fight for it.''
   Added Ford, ``I was born free. I am not free. I will be free on
May 7.''
   Rivers of people carrying colorful party flags poured into the
rally area Wednesday.
   Fireworks burst in the muggy air overhead and enthusiastic
opposition supporters fueled a street fire with pro-government
candidates' flags pulled from trees and lampposts.
   Speeches by Ford and Endara were broken up, once when the crowd
panicked after opposition security guards moved in on people
including some journalists trying to climb a fence protecting the
candidates.
   At least one person was carried from the stampede but did not
appear to be seriously injured. Others were knocked to the ground
but walked away without assistance.
   There was more panic when opposition supporters identified an
alleged government informer, or ``toad'' and chased him through the
crowd, beating him with sticks until he escaped.
   Many signs at the rally addressed the issue of vote rigging.
   Arias said a 29 percent jump in voter rolls since the 1984
elections was ``unexplainable.'' In the same period, there has been
only a 16 percent increase in population.
   The opposition contends the difference represents duplicate
voting cards and other measures issued to give pro-government
candidates an edge. Government officials say the increase is the
result of improved registration methods.
   After Noriega was indicted, then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle
tried to oust him but the general forced out Delvalle.
   Noriega and the government accuse the opposition of being
lackeys of the United States, which has imposed economic sanctions
on Panama as part of its attempt to drive him from power.
   Noriega says the United States is trying to get rid of him as
part of a plan to retain control of the Panama Canal.
   According to a 1977 treaty, the United States is to turn the
waterway over to local control in the year 2000 and remove its
12,000 military personnel from Panama.
   Among the observers expected Sunday are former presidents Jimmy
Carter, who signed the treaty, and Gerald Ford. They are part of an
unofficial U.S. delegation invited by the Panamanian government.
   The government has rejected any official U.S. delegation.

   A passenger train derailed about 400 miles
northwest of Mexico City, killing at least eight people and
injuring another 50, the government news agency Notimex said.
   The agency quoted railroad officials as saying the accident
Wednesday afternoon just north of this Nayarit state capital
occurred on a train that was bound for the border city of Nogales,
70 miles south of Tucson, Ariz.
   It was the second serious train accident in Mexico in as many

   On Tuesday evening, at least 20 people suffered minor injuries
when a passenger train plowed into a parked locomotive outside the
station in Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, Calif.

<HEAD>Administration Considering Total Electronics Ban For Airline Passengers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says it might prohibit
airline passengers from taking aboard portable computers, tape
players, hair dryers and other electronic devices as a stopgap
measure against terrorist bombings.
   The ban, covering items carried by hand or in luggage, would
prevent such items from being used to smuggle plastic explosives
aboard planes until sophisticated bomb-detection devices can be
installed at high risk airports around the world.
   Both Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and his deputy
secretary, Elaine Chao, raised the possibility of a total ban on
electronic devices in forums this week. Ms. Chao said Wednesday it
could include everything from hair driers and electric shavers to
lap-top computers and portable tape players.
   ``A total ban is an option that we'll have to consider,'' she
said, adding that other alternatives also were being discussed both
in the United States and abroad.
   Relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 asked that radio-cassettes and similar
devices be banned after officials concluded that plastic explosives
concealed in such a unit blew up the plane over Scotland.
   Current X-ray units used for hand-carried items cannot detect
plastic explosives, and checked-in luggage usually is not scanned
at all.
   The Transportation Department has ordered airlines to buy and
install devices that can detect plastic bombs, such as thermal
neutron analysis units which have been tested by the Federal
Aviation Administration on checked-in luggage. Skinner said the
first unit will be installed at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in July and another one in Great Britain later in the year.
   But officials acknowledge it could take two years or more to set
up the $1 million units in all high-risk airports.
   A bill passed by a congressional subcommittee on Tuesday would
have the government grant airlines and airports $270 million to pay
for the units. The administration insists the airlines should pay,
adding the cost to a security fee collected with airline tickets.
   Skinner said President Bush, who met with a group of the Flight
103 relatives last month, has been pressing him on the issue of
electronic devices. The secretary said he also took it up with
European transportation officials during his visits to five
countries last week.
   ``If we're going to develop a program that's going to work on
electronic devices, it's got to work with other nations,'' Skinner
said in a National Press Club speech on Tuesday.
   ``All governments agreed to work to develop a standard
program,'' Skinner said. He noted that many journalists regularly
travel with portable computers and other devices that might be
affected if a ban were imposed.
   ``We have to come up with a solution to make sure that if these
devices go on airplanes they are safe and that a bomb is not
inadvertently planted in one of these devices,'' Skinner said.
   But he added, ``We will not compromise safety for the sake of
expediency.''
   Both Skinner and Ms. Chao said that despite the need for
additional security measures in the United States and abroad,
airplanes are among the safest ways to travel and U.S. airlines are
the safest in the world.

<HEAD>Veteran State Official Says Reagan-Era Bush Declaration was Wrong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late in the Reagan administration a task force
headed by Vice President George Bush branded 52 groups around the
world as practitioners of terrorism, among them the African
National Congress in white-ruled South Africa.
   Now, the veteran Foreign Service officer nominated by President
Bush to be assistant secretary of state for African affairs says
that was a mistake.
   At his confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, the nominee, Herman J. Cohen, testified that
the black-nationalist organization is too important to be ignored
as the United States seeks a peaceful, negotiated end to South
Africa's system of racial apartheid.
   Cohen was asked by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., about the listing
of the ANC as a terrorist organization and about testimony from
Secretary of State James A. Baker III that it would be
``reasonable'' for the United States to shun such a group unless it
renounced terrorist tactics.
   Cohen took the opposite view.
   ``Sir, I think the designation of the ANC as a terrorist
organization was not correct,'' Cohen said.
   ``Wow!'' Helms exclaimed.
   Cohen said the ANC is a large and active organization and
conceded that the group's military wing has engaged in terrorist
acts.
   ``But I don't think we can designate the entire organization as
a terrorist organization because of one activity by one of their
wings,'' he said.
   ``In our discussions with them we have said we denounce such
violence and that our relations with them have to be very minimal
because of that.
   ``But since they are such an important organization and have
such a great influence in what goes on in South Africa, I don't
think it would be in our interest not to deal with them, not to
talk to them,'' Cohen said.
   Responding to further questions from Helms, Cohen said he
believes the military wing of the ANC has abandoned the practice of
``necklacing'' in which tires were placed around the necks of
opponents, filled with gasoline and set afire.
   He added that he would recommend that Baker meet with Oliver
Tambo, the ANC's president, if he visits Washington. He said a
meeting between Tambo and President Bush would depend on the
outcome of Tambo's discussions with Baker.
   Overall, Cohen said he sees a new realism emerging in South
Africa on both sides of the apartheid battle with the government
recognizing that it cannot impose changes on the black majority
without their consent and the majority recognizing it cannot cause
the collapse of the white power structure by direct frontal
assaults.
   ``It is increasingly clear to the black leadership, in my view,
that constitutional change will have to come through a process of
negotiation in which there will be no losers,'' the nominee said.
   Cohen, 57, a career Foreign Service officer since 1953, has
served as U.S. ambassador to the republics of Senegal and Gambia.
For the last two years he was the National Security Council's
senior director for Africa.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry's political problems are
mounting with the indictment of one of his former closest advisers,
who is charged with steering contracts to friends and routing money
from the deals to Barry's re-election campaign.
   A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted two men, including
former Barry adviser David E. Rivers, on charges they conspired to
award $3 million in city health services contracts to friends.
   Rivers and prominent city contractor John B. Clyburn were
indicted after they allegedly worked to secure several city
contracts for a company headed by undercover FBI agents, gave other
contracts to friends and assigned still others to a company Clyburn
owned.
   Rivers also faces two counts of agreeing to accept a bribe,
while Clyburn has been charged with helping to bribe him.
   Barry, already under federal investigation for his ties to a
drug suspect, said in a prepared statement, ``My focus continues to
be on managing the District of Columbia government.''
   Compounding Barry's difficulties are a growing drug-related
crime wave and the possibility that Jesse Jackson, Barry's longtime
civil rights ally, might move to the nation's capital and run for
mayor in 1990.
   Prosecutors provided no details on how money from the alleged
contract steering ended up in Barry's 1986 reelection campaign
fund, but a source familiar with Barry's 1986 campaign told The
Associated Press that Rivers and Clyburn organized at least one
fund-raiser for Barry's 1986 campaign.
   The indictments come after a 21-month grand jury probe that
followed a 17-month undercover FBI investigation into the city's
contracting procedures.
   If convicted of all charges, Rivers and Clyburn could each face
maximum prison terms of 50 years.
   ``This indictment alleged a seamy web of corruption, of
concealment, of manipulation and of self-dealing by one of the most
senior officials in the District of Columbia government,'' said
U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens.
   Stephens alleged that both Clyburn and Rivers took ``about 10
percent off the top'' in kickbacks for the 20 contracts and
contract extensions mentioned in the indictment.
   Rivers was out of town Wednesday, said his attorney, John Mercer.
   The 49-page indictment charges that the alleged contracting
scheme took place from 1983 through May 1987.
   Rivers took a leave of absence from his city job in August 1987
after he became a target of the investigation.

<HEAD>Administration Fights for FSX Deal Before Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>LaserPhoto WX ^By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will develop an advanced jet fighter
regardless of whether the United States participates, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney told congressional critics of the FSX jet
fighter.
   ``Disapproval of the FSX by the Congress would most likely
result in Japan modifying an existing aircraft to meet the
immediate military need, and then attempting to develop
indigenously a follow-on aircraft, possibly with European
assistance,'' Cheney told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Cheney was one of three top administration officials who went
Wednesday to Capitol Hill in an effort to put on a unified show of
administration support of the FSX deal.
   Also appearing were Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger.
   ``I am confident that this agreement will not harm the economic
security interests of the United States,'' Mosbacher told the
panel. Mosbacher previously had voiced concern within the
administration over economic implications of the $7 billion deal.
   Under the agreement, St. Louis-based General Dynamics and
Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would join forces to co-develop
and co-produce the FSX, an advanced version of the U.S. F-16, for
deployment by Japan in the late 1990s.
   But Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., declared at the hearing that ``I
remain convinced that co-development of the FSX is not in America's
national interest.''
   Levine has been joined by 36 House co-sponsors in introducing a
draft resolution of disapproval aimed at halting the deal. A
companion resolution has been introduced in the Senate.
   Critics of the deal have called it a ``giveaway'' of valuable
advanced technology that Japan may use to propel its own aircraft
industry into head-to-head competition with the United States in
the world market.
   They have argued that Japan instead should buy ``off the shelf''
American-made F-16s, to bolster its military capability more
quickly, at lower cost per plane and help reduce the $55 billion
U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   Even if the House and Senate were to pass the resolutions,
however, it would require a two-thirds vote of both house to
override a likely Bush veto.
   Mosbacher told the committee he was satisfied with
``clarifications'' reached with the Japanese, providing for a U.S.
share of about 40 percent in both development and production of the
plane, as well as tight controls on transfer of sensitive
technology to Japan.
   Cheney and Mosbacher reiterated the contention by supporters
that the FSX agreement would bring advanced technology from Japan
to the United States.
   However, Levine cited a report by the General Accounting Office,
an investigative arm of Congress, which found that key technologies
to be received from Japan _ involving composite wing construction
and phased-array radar _ are already well known to the U.S.
aircraft industry and in some cases are 10 years old.
   Cheney responded that the Japanese have made ``significant
advancements'' in industrial application of these technologies.
   ``While some, or even most, of the technologies that (the
Defense Department) is interested in exist in some form in this
country, U.S. industry has not successfully developed them into
usable technologies on the scale involved with the FSX,'' he said.
   Eagleburger sought to rebut another argument raised by FSX
critics, about reports that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had been
involved in building a bomb fabrication facility adjacent to a
suspected chemical weapons production plant in Libya.
   The No. 2 State Department official said there was no evidence
that the Japanese company was in fact involved with constructing
any portion of the Libyan complex. Eagleburger called such reports
``misinformation.''

   Sharing friendship and a fatal disease, the
mayors of Pittsburgh and Erie turned to faith healers in a hotel
room 17 months ago and joined hands to pray for a cure to save
their lives.
   ``Christ has cured a lot of people and I said, `What do we have
to lose?''' Erie's Louis J. Tullio said Wednesday. ``We're people,
too, and he can touch anyone.''
   ``Lou is still alive and I think this has something to do with
it,'' said Jeanne Caliguiri, widow of Pittsburgh Mayor Richard S.
Caliguiri.
   Caliguiri died at age 56 on May 6, five months after he and
Tullio prayed with faith healers Charles and Frances Hunter.
   The mayors were diagnosed in 1987 with amyloidosis, which
infiltrates and destroys vital organs through excess protein.
   ``We were talking about the things of God,'' Mrs. Hunter said in
a telephone interview Wednesday from Kingwood, Texas. ``When we
thought it was the right time, we just laid hands on them. You
never know when the healing is going to connect.''
   Jack Grazier, a reporter for the Erie Daily Times, said he
introduced the mayors to the Hunters on Dec. 12, 1987. Grazier and
his wife, Debbie, also joined the prayer session. Grazier said he
knew the Hunters from 1985, when the couple prayed for Grazier's
wife to become pregnant.
   The session was not publicized at the time. Grazier describes
the meeting in detail in his book ``The Power Beyond,'' to be
published in June.
   ``Here were these guys wielding so much power in Pennsylvania's
second- and third-largest cities going to a hotel room to meet with
elderly faith healers in hopes of being cured of a fatal illness,''
Grazier said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   ``To see them humbled like that was sort of a surreal
experience. Here they were praying for their very lives,'' Grazier
said. ``We were right up against it.''
   Both mayors disclosed within weeks of each other that they
suffered from amyloidosis, a rare disease that usually strikes men
of Mediterranean descent.
   Caliguiri, Pittsburgh mayor for 11 years, died of heart failure
resulting from the disease. The 72-year-old Tullio, Erie's mayor
for 23 years, has battled fluid accumulations in his lungs for
several months and was released from a hospital Saturday.
   Tullio and Grazier said Caliguiri was hesitant at first to join
the session because of his Roman Catholic faith.
   ``I said prayers are prayers and we have to have the Lord cure
us. Where it comes from is immaterial. I told him I thought it was
a great idea,'' said Tullio, who is also a Roman Catholic.
   ``I know Dick did it because of Lou. They were very close,''
Mrs. Caliguiri said. ``I remember sitting around a table and
holding hands with each other. They were both very inspirational to
both Dick and I,'' she said of the Hunters.
   According to Grazier, Caliguiri described his illness in detail.
Tullio added his own description of the disease but was impatient
to pray as the group talked about faith healing, positive thinking,
God and the devil.
   Soon, they stood in prayer in a circle around the mayors,
touching the mayors' arms, shoulders and backs as the Hunters
prayed.
   Caliguiri said he was trying to ``get this out of me by just
concentrating because I've read books on how people have gotten
better through their own ... tenacity ... and positive thinking,''
according to Grazier.
   Tullio described the session as ``wonderful.''
   ``I have become more religious as a result of my sickness,''
Tullio said. ``Asking the Lord to cure you and having everyone pray
for you means a lot.''

<HEAD>Medicare Surtax to Be Subject of Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee is arranging a
hearing this month to examine the financial underpinning of the new
catastrophic illness insurance program _ specifically whether the
surtax imposed on better-off Medicare recipients is too high.
   The hearing is a direct outgrowth of the outcry from elderly
Medicare beneficiaries who will be hit with an income tax surcharge
that can range up to $800 this year for about 5 percent of them in
upper income ranges.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the committee chairman and a major
architect of the landmark legislation that took effect Jan. 1,
recently raised the prospect that the maximum surcharge could be
reduced. He said new revenue estimates show the tax surcharge will
generate more money than originally contemplated.
   Ironically, those revised estimates suggest elderly Americans as
a group are better off financially than calculated last summer when
Congress was deciding to finance a major part of the program with a
progressive surtax, or ``supplemental premium,'' applied only to
Medicare enrollees.
   President Bush has taken the position that even though more
money than anticipated is flowing into the Medicare catastrophic
illness coverage fund, it still will not be enough to cover costs
over the long term.
   By publicly asking Bush for his thoughts on reducing the surtax,
Bentsen has cast the White House in the role of opposing a tax
reduction for elderly Americans.
   However, Bentsen had predicted in January that much of the
political support for reducing the tax surcharge would evaporate
after it became clear from hearings that nearly two-thirds of
Medicare beneficiaries _ or about 21 million people _ would pay
only $48 a year in additional fees in 1989 _ the flat $4 a month
increase imposed on everyone.
   For the remaining 12 million beneficiaries _ those with enough
taxable income to have to pay at least $150 a year in tax _ the
surcharge is determined by adding $22.50 per person to each $150 of
income tax liability.
   That means the surtax can be as little as $45 for a couple, or
as much as $1,600 and will show up first on tax returns filed after
Jan. 1, 1990 covering the current year.
   Medicare beneficiaries in lower income ranges tend to have lower
tax liabilities than wage-earners with a comparable gross income
because their Social Security benefits are not subject to taxes.
   Although individual circumstances vary widely, Congress' Joint
Committee on Taxation estimates a typical couple on Medicare would
have to have an income of at least $20,000 a year before having to
pay a surcharge and that, on average, it would amount to about $50
for a couple in the $20,000-$25,000 income range.
   The committee estimates about 1.6 million of the 33 million
people covered by Medicare would be hit by the maximum surcharge
this year _ and a comparable percentage in subsequent years as both
benefits and costs increase.
   Both the basic monthly fee and the ``supplemental premium''
rise, reaching $10.20 a month and $42 per $150 tax liability in
1993 when the expansion _ including a new prescription drug benefit
_ is fully implemented.
   That translates to a maximum 1993 surtax of $1,050 per
individual, or $2,100 for a couple.
   Using those actual 1993 fees and surcharges, the Joint Taxation
Committee estimates 11.1 percent of the program's total cost will
be born by those in the $75,000 to $200,000 income range, that
taxpayers in that category account for 12.9 percent of all reported
income and that their average return will be $112,538, in 1988
dollars.
   It does not break down its distribution estimates to the
$75,000-$100,000 range _ the lowest category where the maximum
surtax would start taking effect _ but says the average return in
that category will be $87,371 for a couple, again in 1988 dollars.
   Because the surtax is capped, those with incomes above $200,000
will pay 3.2 percent of the program costs in 1993. They account for
19.3 percent of income reported on tax returns.
   By contrast, the committee estimates 23.9 percent of 1993
program costs will fall on those in the $20,000 to $30,000 income
range, again in 1988 dollars, even though they account for 18.2
percent of total income, and that 25.1 percent of the costs will be
borne by those in the $30,000 to $50,000 range, who account for
16.3 percent of all income.
   It projects the 1993 tax surcharge for a middle-class retired
couple with $20,000 to $25,000 income at about $90, rising to about
$240 for a couple with a $30,000 to $35,000 income.
   For the current year, the committee projects the supplemental
premium for a $20,000 to $25,000 a year couple will average about
$50, rising to about $150 for a couple in the $30,000-$35,000 range.
   The committee estimates the maximum 1989 surtax for a couple
will kick in at the $75,000 to $100,000 level and that the average
joint return in that category will be $85,751.
   It estimates the average return in the $100,000-$200,000 level
will be $136,304.
   For joint returns above $200,000, the average jumps to $677,495
per return.

   Christine Jorgensen, who told the
world in 1952 she was a woman trapped in a man's body and shocked
it by becoming the first person to undergo a sex change, is dead.
She was 62.
   Miss Jorgensen died of cancer at San Clemente Hospital on
Wednesday, two days after she was admitted, said hospital
spokeswoman Jami Piearson.
   She fought a 2{-year battle with the cancer, which began in her
bladder. And a few weeks ago doctors found a brain tumor, according
to Chris Costello, a friend, publicist and daughter of the late
comedian Lou Costello.
   ``She was a wonderful, understanding woman who loved everyone,''
said actress Dorothy Lamour, who also was a friend of Miss
Jorgensen. ``She gave out so much love and was a God-loving woman;
one of the finest women I have ever met,'' Miss Lamour said in a
statement read by Ms. Costello.
   Miss Jorgensen, a heavy smoker, said in an interview last year
that when she learned she had cancer she told herself:
   ```This is cancer.' I wanted to be upfront and not try to deny
it. It's like anything else. I still joke and carry on. I see some
of the patients who just shuffle in and out, and you just know that
they aren't going to make it.''
   She voiced no regrets about the sex change and the ensuing
international publicity.
   ``I am very proud now, looking back,'' she said. ``It was the
sexual revolution that was going to start with or without me. We
may not have started it, but we gave it a good swift kick in the
pants.''
   Her operation is much more commonplace today.
   As of 1980, an estimates 3,000 to 6,000 adults in the United
States had undergone hormonal and surgical sex changes, according
to Harry Benjamin of the International Gender Dysphoria Association.
   The association estimates that 30,000 to 60,000 people have
considered themselves candidates for the surgery.
   Miss Jorgensen said last year her operation ``wouldn't get on
the 95th page of the newspaper if it happened today.''
   She cherished her privacy and spent her final years as a
homebody who stayed as much as she could out of the limelight.
   Still, the transsexual pioneer remained unafraid of publicity
and sued a Mission Viejo hospital for treatment of a cracked
shoulder bone and several vertebrae after she fell in September
1987.
   She had said the injury was partially responsible for her not
taking the lead role in an Anaheim production of the musical
``Mame.''
   Miss Jorgensen was born George Jorgensen Jr. on May 30, 1926, in
New York City to parents of Danish descent.
   At age 26, the handsome former soldier shocked the world when
news of the sex-change operation was leaked by a family friend.
   The willowy blonde who left the operating room in Copenhagen,
Denmark, found that her new life made her an instant celebrity. Her
notoriety sent her on the talk show, lecture and nightclub
circuits. She met royalty and celebrities and ended up with enough
money, jewels and furs to live a comfortable life.
   She never married and had lived the last few years in San
Clemente, a seaside community about 50 miles south of downtown Los
Angeles. She had lived in California the last 20 years, Ms.
Costello said.
   Miss Jorgensen had been planning a sequel to her 1967 book
``Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Biography,'' Ms. Costello said.
   She also was working on finding a U.S. distributor for a
documentary produced in Denmark on transsexuals, lesbians and
female impersonators.
   ``Christine was the type of person who always had an iron in the
fire even in the very end,'' Ms. Costello said.
   Miss Jorgensen is survived by a sister and two nieces. A private
memorial was planned, and arrangements for a public service are
pending.

   Today is ``Tax Freedom Day,'' the day the
average American taxpayer finishes paying off taxes.
   The Tax Foundation calculates the average American will have to
work 124 days this year _ the same as in 1987 and 1988 _ just to
pay federal, state and local taxes. Today is the 124th day of the
year.
   Tax Freedom Day has never fallen later in the year. This year's
date is also the same as in 1981, before President Reagan and
Congress agreed on a 23-percent across-the-board cut in individual
income tax rates.
   Economists for the foundation, a nonpartisan Washington research
group, say the value of that tax cut has been offset by more than a
dozen subsequent federal tax increases and by higher state and
local taxes caused partially by cuts in federal programs.

<NOTE>First Grant Given to Town Near Base That Will Be Closed</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town of Rantoul, Ill., is receiving the
first federal planning grant to help cope with the upcoming round
of military base closings.
   The Defense Department said Wednesday that the community next to
the Chanute Air Force Base will receive $73,045 ``to help organize
a base reuse committee to start planning the civilian conversion of
the base property.''
   In addition to the federal money, Rantoul is contributing money
and services worth $11,300 and the state of Illinois $10,000 to
support the effort.
   The grant to Rantoul is the first since Congress approved a long
list of base closings last month under a special procedure set up
last year. Chanute Air Force Base is one of 86 bases now set for
closure under the program, which was prompted primarily by budget
concerns.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The local economy is holding together
more than a year after the United States imposed sanctions on the
government, but increasingly it is a hand-to-mouth, day-to-day
existence.
   The sanctions of March and April 1988 were intended to force the
departure of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongman
who has been indicted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges.
   Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces, is a central issue in
Sunday's presidential election.
   Washington and the domestic political opposition accuse the
government of planning to cheat to ensure Noriega's handpicked
candidate victory.
   The sanctions froze about $56 million in Panamanian government
deposits in U.S. banks and banned payments of taxes and some fees
to Panamanian government entities.
   The United States also is holding about $140 million in Panama
Canal payments in the name of Eric Delvalle, deposed by Noriega in
March 1988 and still recognized by the United States as Panama's
president.
   Bank deposits are down sharply, huge sums have left the country,
savings accounts remain frozen and cash is short; loan availability
is down sharply as is new construction in what used to be a booming
Panama City.
   Ironically, the survival of the economy is due mostly to what
the United States and U.S. businesses spend here _ about $500
million a year not counting the payrolls for 10,000 troops and
several large American companies.
   The businesses include a Texaco refinery, the trans-Panama oil
pipeline and the Cherokee Land Co., which grows bananas but because
of the sanctions does not pay government export taxes of about $1
million a month.
   The $500 million is about 12 percent of Panama's gross domestic
product.
   The government blames nearly all its problems on the sanctions,
although the economic decline actually started in mid-1987, when
Panamanians worried about political instability started sending
money out of the country.
   The government says the gross domestic product dropped 17.1
percent last year, from $5 billion to $4.1 billion; American
economists contend only about a fourth of the drop is due to the
sanctions.
   Panama, which uses the American dollar, has no central bank and
cannot print more money unless it establishes its own currency,
which then would be subject to inflationary pressures.
   In a statement Wednesday, the government's National Banking
Commission said the situation had hit bottom and was starting to
improve slightly.
   But the commission said the banking system has a long way to go
before returning to where it was before the crisis.
   ``It still is necessary to increase the availability of loan
funds in banks. And this can be achieved if we Panamanians keep our
funds in banks in Panama,'' it said.
   Normally in Latin America, repatriation of capital flight
follows a period of political stability, something Panama may not
see for a time.
   A Panamanian government assessment of damages from the
sanctions, published in February, said its income was down 44
percent. The study said the number of Panamanians below the poverty
line has risen from 33 percent to 40 percent.

<HEAD>Man, 78, Who Allegedly Sweet-talked Women Out Of Valuables, Pleads
Guilty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 78-year-old man who police say
spent the last decade sweet-talking women across the country, then
taking their valuables and disappearing, has pleaded guilty to
stealing from a widow.
   Arthur Frankford also faces charges in Polk and Pinellas
counties, and the FBI is looking into the possibility he was
involved in bank robberies, said FBI agent Bob Neuman.
   Frankford, whom police nicknamed ``The Silver Fox,'' may have
cheated scores of lonely women from Iowa to Florida, authorities
said.
   His undoing came when a former sister-in-law saw his case on
NBC-TV's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and called the program's hot line
from the small coal mining town of Stearns, Ky., to say he was
living nearby.
   The case responsible for putting him on national television came
from Palm Beach County. The program depicted him as a man who met
the widow at a church singles dance, wined and dined her and moved
in with her for a month. When he disappeared, he took her jewelry
and a gun that belonged to her late husband.
   ``This guy is slick,'' Palm Beach County sheriff's Detective
Dave Hoyt said. ``He could charm the socks off a dead guy.''
   A Kentucky state trooper watching the show also recognized
Frankford as the man he had arrested on a drunken-driving charge
the previous weekend.
   Officers who went to Frankford's house to arrest him found he
was masquerading as 56-year-old James Ferguson and that he was
married to a 37-year-old woman.
   Frankford was escorted Tuesday into a Palm Beach County
courtroom in handcuffs, pleaded guilty to grand theft and agreed to
pay $500 to the 62-year-old Lake Park widow who allowed him into
her home, her heart and her safe in August.
   When Frankford was arrested, he gave back most of the $4,000
worth of jewelry he had taken, but the victim may never get the
money she is owed. Court records show the man, a former condominium
maintenance worker who has a criminal record dating from 1945,
cannot afford to pay his court costs.
   Frankford, who has spent the past three months in the county
jail, was sentenced to time served. He will be transferred to the
Polk County Jail where he awaits trial on 12 charges of forgery and
grand theft, said Assistant State Attorney Catherine Hall.
   Authorities trying to sort out Frankford's past found a February
1979 warrant based on a complaint from a Sarasota socialite who
told police that Frankford, then known as Ferguson, met her at a
church function, moved in and then stole her Mercedes-Benz.
   A man matching Ferguson's description later moved to Lakeland,
married a prominent woman and took nearly everything she had,
authorities said.
   ``He was unbelievably smooth,'' one victim, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said after Frankford disappeared. ``It was
wining, dining, dancing and trips. He mixed with the family, and he
was a very giving guy who always paid for things. You would never
have known.''

<TEXT>
   A homosexual allowed by a federal appeals
court to re-enlist in the Army says the constitutionality of
military bans on homosexuals will not be settled until more gay
soldiers come out of the closet.
   ``It's an issue that's probably going to take a class
action-type suit before a court makes that broad a ruling, 10 or 12
people in the military who are willing to stand up and say they're
gay,'' Perry Watkins said after Wednesday's ruling.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision that the Army
erred when it denied him re-enlistment was a ``wonderful ruling,''
said the 14-year veteran, who is now working as a U.S. Forest
Service clerk in Seattle.
   Civil rights lawyers who supported his case said the ruling was
important despite its limited scope.
   ``It is not a sweeping constitutional decision, but it is a
first step that recognizes the value of the services of openly gay
soldiers,'' said Nan Hunter of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, which helped Watkins.
   Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman, declined to comment on
the ruling, but said there had been several other cases that have
supported the ban against homosexuals from military service. He
said any decision concerning an appeal would be made by the
solicitor general, the Justice Department's top litigator, who has
not reviewed the ruling.
   If the Army doesn't appeal Wednesday's ruling, Watkins said he
would like to re-enlist.
   The court ruled in Watkins' favor on narrow grounds, saying he
was entitled to reinstatement because the Army was aware of his
homosexuality when he had previously re-enlisted.
   Watkins, of Tacoma, ``has greatly benefited the Army, and
therefore the country, by his military service,'' said Judge Harry
Pregerson in the majority opinion.
   But Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall said the Army never promised
Watkins an indefinite exemption from its ban. She also said a court
ruling prohibiting a service branch from applying one of its
regulations would have ``a disruptive effect on military
discipline.''
   Seven of the 11 judges voted in Watkins' favor, but only two
addressed the constitutional issue that a smaller panel of the
court had cited in a now-withdrawn February 1988 decision.
   That ruling was the first by any federal appeals court to
declare that homosexuals, because of longstanding persecution and
political powerlessness, were entitled to be protected against
discrimination to the same degree as racial minorities. By
sidestepping that issue Wednesday, the court left it unresolved.
   In Wednesday's decision, the court said it would be unjust to
allow the Army to enforce its anti-homosexual policy against
Watkins because he said he was a homosexual when he was drafted in
1967 and had been drafted and allowed to re-enlist three times
while the policy was in effect. After two tours of duty in Korea,
he became supervisor of the Fort Lewis, Wash., personnel
administration center.
   Defense Department regulations prohibited the enlistment or
re-enlistment of homosexuals throughout that period. New
regulations were added in 1981 to require the discharge of soldiers
whose homosexual conduct was discovered while they were in the
military.
   After a federal judge stopped the Army from discharging Watkins,
he was denied re-enlistment in 1982.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein ordered Watkins
reinstated, on grounds identical to Wednesday's ruling, but was
reversed in 1983 by the appeals court, leading to Watkins'
discharge the following year.

<HEAD>Woman Recounts How Wright Aide Once Nearly Killed Her</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pamela Small says she avoids business visits
to the Capitol because she could encounter the man who savagely
attacked her with a knife and hammer 16 years ago and now is a top
aide to House Speaker Jim Wright.
   But anger more than fear is what deters Small, an executive with
the Washington office of a major corporation. Anger that John Paul
Mack, 35, is one of the most powerful staff members on Capitol
Hill, earning about $89,500 a year as Wright's closest aide.
   Mack wouldn't have the job ``if he hadn't tried to kill me,''
Small told The Washington Post in an interview published today. She
described the unprovoked attack that required her to have seven
hours of emergency surgery and more than a year of plastic surgery
and hair transplants.
   ``Obviously, I would rather he still be in prison,'' she said.
``If he's not, I'm not sure what I would want him doing. But
playing a major part in running the government and making a lot of
money off my taxes isn't it.
   ``This guy has gotten special treatment from the beginning. All
the victim ever gets is a ride to the hospital.''
   Mack, whose brother was married to Wright's daughter at the
time, served just 27 months of a 15-year prison sentence for
malicious wounding before making parole, according to the Post. A
job offer from Wright helped make Mack's release possible, the
story said.
   The Post also reported that Mack served his sentence in the
Fairfax County, Va., Jail, rather than the state penitentiary.
   The attack happened in a discount store in the Washington suburb
of Annandale, Va., in 1973. Small was a 20-year-old college student
living with her parents but getting ready to move into her first
apartment.
   Mack was a clerk at the store, where Small went to buy blinds.
Unsuspectingly, Small followed Mack into a storeroom when the only
blinds on display turned out to be flawed. The attack began when
she refused to lie down as he had ordered.
   He pounded her once in the head with a hammer, knocking her
unconscious immediately, and then struck her four more times,
exposing her skull in five places, according to the Post.
   ``He just reached out with his arm and the next thing I knew ...
was the sound of the blow,'' she said. ``It was like when you dive
into water ... that sound. The sound and pain together were unreal
... like my brain was being squeezed into a tiny black dot.''
   He then stabbed her five times and slashed at her throat with a
steak knife.
   When she awoke some eight hours later, she was in her compact
car that Mack had driven to an alley. Despite her wounds, she drove
one mile to a service station for help.
   Although she knew as far back as 1977 that Mack was working on
the Hill _ she learned through an acquaintance who was dating him _
she didn't realize how prestigious a job he held.
   As executive director of the Congressional Democratic Steering
and Policy Committee, Mack decides which legislation to put on the
agenda, and which to keep off.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif, called Mack one of the
``top five staffers on the Hill in terms of competence.''
   ``This society believes in forgiveness,'' Coelho said.
   Mack, when contacted by the Post, said: ``When I was 19, I made
a terrible, tragic mistake. I regret it every day. I accepted the
judgment of society then and I accept it now. I have to put that
behind me.
   ``All I ask is that I be judged by what I've done since in terms
of trustworthiness, loyalty to my country, my family, and those who
depend on me.''
   Wright refused to comment for the story.

<HEAD>McDonald's Unveils Site of First Moscow Restaurant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's intends to lift its golden arches and
introduce the standard of a quick meal in clean surroundings when
it opens its largest restaurant in the world in Moscow.
   McDonald's announced its plans on Wednesday by posting a sign
outside a gutted cafe in a prime location on Pushkin Square at
Gorky Street, Moscow's major downtown shopping area.
   To meet a demand described as ``infinite,'' the first
McDonald's, to open by year's end, will have 860 seats indoors and
out and more than 400 Soviet employees, said George A. Cohon,
president of McDonald's of Canada Ltd., a subsidiary of McDonald's
Corp. of Oak Brook, Ill.
   It should be capable of serving 12,000 to 15,000 people a day,
he said.
   ``We opened in Budapest a year ago, and to this day, people are
lined down the street,'' Cohon said. His firm is a 49 percent
partner with the Soviet government in the joint venture.
   Even the Communist Party newspaper Pravda gushed in March that
when McDonald's finally opens, people will be able to ``give an
order and within moments walk away from the counter with appetizing
food.''
   McDonald's first announced its plans more than a year ago but
has had to overcome a shortage of quality food in the Soviet Union.
   To sell Big Macs for 1.50 to 2.50 rubles _ about $2.40 to $3.90
_ McDonald's is going local for its supplies, said Vladimir
Malyshkov, director of the Moscow Food Service Administration. His
agency, better known for offering greasy fare in dingy cafeterias,
is the Soviet partner in the venture.
   ``We're doing our best to make everything Soviet,'' Malyshkov
said.
   But to do that, McDonald's is shipping its own Burbank Russet
seed potatoes, teaching the Soviets how to raise the beef and
building its own processing plant, said spokeman Paul Chater.
Otherwise, it could suffer the same shortages and spoilage problems
as the average Soviet consumer.
   The factory, under construction by a Finnish firm in suburban
Moscow, will produce burgers, buns, French fries and milk for the
20 restaurants planned for Moscow, Cohon said. Lettuce will be
grown in greenhouses.
   Forget McDLT's _ Cohon gave up on finding a year-round Soviet
supply of tomatoes.
   The second restaurant, closer to Red Square, will sell its
hamburgers only for foreign currency.
   Getting profits out of the Soviet Union is the stumbling block
for most business deals because rubles are worthless in the rest of
the world and the Soviet Union has an extreme shortage of foreign
currency.
   But Cohon said he's not concerned about getting his profits out
of the country.
   ``We'll use our rubles to expand,'' he said. ``We're not worried
about taking profits out now. We're concerned about the 10,000
people who are going to line up here every day.''

<TEXT>
   A fisherman found the body of a baby in a
trash barrel but authorities wouldn't say if it was the infant
whose parents have reported two child abductions in three years.
   St. Charles County Sheriff Ed Uebinger refused to say if the
body was that of 6-week-old Heather Sims of Alton, Ill., but said
that there are no other reports of missing babies in the area.
   An autopsy was planned today to determine the identity and cause
of death.
   The body was found Wednesday night at an old lock and dam on the
Mississippi River north of St. Louis. The site is directly across
the river from where the girl's parents, Robert and Paula Sims,
live.
   ``A fisherman was in the area and saw an individual acting a
little bit suspicious,'' Uebinger said at the site of the
discovery. ``He walked over to one of these trash barrels, looked
inside and found the body.''
   The fisherman told investigators that when he moved toward the
barrel, the person left, Uebinger said. No other information was
released about the fisherman or the person seen at the barrel.
   Heather's parents told police that a masked man approached Mrs.
Sims while she was taking out the trash Saturday, forced her back
into the home, knocked her unconscious and took the infant.
   The circumstances of Heather's reported abduction were similar
to the June 1986 disappearance of Loralei Sims, the couple's first
child. The couple reported an armed intruder entered their home in
Brighton, Ill., and took their 13-day-old infant.
   A week later, the Loralei's remains were found near that home.
The cause of death was not determined and no one was charged,
although the parents were considered suspects. At the time, they
denied any involvement in their daughter's disappearance and death.
   St. Charles County deputies asked for a copy of Heather's
footprint shortly after the body was found. Earlier Wednesday,
Alton police used a search warrant to seize medical records of the
child, her mother and father.
   Sims called police saying he learned about the fisherman's
discovery from a TV news report, said Alton Police Sgt. Billy
Lawrence.
   ``He asked when someone (from the police department) was going
to come and talk to him,'' Lawrence said.
   The Simses have declined comment, citing advice from police.
They also have a 15-month-old son who was sleeping at the time of
the reported abduction.

   A strong earthquake severely damaged
seven villages in central Iran, injuring four people, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported today.
   The quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, occurred
Wednesday and was centered about 480 miles south of Tehran, near
the city of Shiraz.
   The agency said the noon quake destroyed homes in seven Fars
Province villages that were already damaged by a quake last year.
   Many of the villagers had moved out of their homes after last
year's quake and were living in tents, the agency said. It did not
detail the injuries.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage, while one

   Two Chinese dissidents were stopped in Tokyo from
boarding a flight for Beijing today because the Chinese government
told airlines not to accept them, they said.
   Wang Bingzhang and Tang Guangzhang, leaders of the Chinese
Alliance of Democracy, said they were not allowed to get on Japan
Airlines Flight 5.
   The men said they wanted to come to Beijing to ``investigate''
the student pro-democracy movement, the biggest ever in Communist
China's 40-year history.
   A spokesman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to
comment on the dissidents' allegations because, he said, they did
not constitute a question of foreign affairs. He declined to say
which ministry handled the affair.
   Wang, a native of China who has become an American citizen, said
he had no visa to enter China. He said he had planned to stay in
China for several days ``on transit'' and then head to Thailand.
   Tang, a Chinese citizen and chemistry student at Utah State
University, said he did not understand why he had been denied the
right to board a plane to his homeland.
   He was thrown out of China on Jan. 9 after he was apprehended in
Shanghai with copies of China Spring. The magazine is published by
the Chinese Alliance of Democracy, based in New York City. Wang set
up the dissident group in 1983 to promote democracy in China.
   Chinese officials have declared the alliance and its magazine
illegal and reactionary.
   Earlier this week, the government implied the group had been
supporting the student movement.
   Wang said that although his group agrees with the students'
demands for a more democratic country, his organization had not
contacted the movement.
   But he said he was determined to enter China and do so.
   ``We have made up our minds to use any possible methods to
return, including sneaking into the country,'' Wang said.
   Tang said he didn't think his activities would hurt the movement
by giving the Chinese government an excuse to crack down on student
protesters.
   ``Democracy is a common desire of all peoples, both overseas and
inside China,'' he said. ``It doesn't make a difference where you
are.''
   Both men said they would return to the United States to consider
their next move.

   State education officials said there was
good news and bad news in a national report that ranked Mississippi
at or near the bottom in college entrance test scores and
graduation rates.
   ``The good news is we continue to make progress. The bad news is
that progress comes slowly and even though we're beginning to pass
states by, we continue to rank down near the bottom,'' said state
Superintendent of Education Richard Boyd.
   The U.S. Education Department's ``State Education Performance
Chart'' released Wednesday showed Mississippi had made some gains,
but fared poorly compared to the rest of the nation.
   Mississippi ranked last among the 28 states where the American
College Testing Program, or ACT, is the predominant college
entrance examination.
   But state Department of Education spokesman Andy Mullins said
the average Mississippi ACT score was up 0.7 point to 16.2 in 1988
over 1987. The test is scored on a scale of 1 to 36. Nationwide,
the average score was up 0.1 point to 18.8, and 11 states showed a
decline in scores.
   ``There's a good news scenario unfolding which shows that
Mississippi is one of five states showing the greatest movement in
ACT scores over the period 1982 through 1988,'' said Olon Ray,
education assistant to Gov. Ray Mabus.
   Ray said it was ``interesting and also significant that (the
improvement in Mississippi) parallels the life of the education
reform movement in the state.''
   The Legislature in 1982 followed the urging of then-Gov. William
Winter and apporved the Education Reform Act, which made sweeping
changes in Mississippi's education system. Mabus has promised to
propose an ``Education Reform II'' package this year.
   But state Rep. Jim Simpson, chairman of the House Education
Committee, said the new report ``points up that education reform is
not something you enact and look next year to see if the problem is
gone.
   ``We are not through with education,'' said Simpson. ``I'm
afraid people want an overnight cure.''
   Mississippi ranked 43rd in the amount spent per student as a
percentage of the state's per capita income. Mississippi school
districts spent an average $2,350 per student in 1987, about 22.8
percent of the state's per capita income of $10,292.
   The report also ranked the state 44th in 1987 in the number of
students who enter first grade and eventually receive high school
diplomas. The state's graduation rate was 64.8 percent.
   The state was in 41st place in 1988 in the teacher-student
ratio, with 18.8 pupils for every teacher. The national average was
17.6.
   ``We're encouraged by the fact that we're doing much better in
some very important areas,'' Ray said. ``We also understand that in
order to be competitive, we're going to have to do much better.''

   Innovative programs, school evaluations and
committed teachers, lawmakers and parents have helped Minnesota
lead the nation in the percentage of students graduating from high
school, state officials said.
   ``We're delighted that we continue to hold that ranking,''
Minnesota Education Commissioner Ruth Randall said Wednesday,
noting the state has had the No. 1 high school graduation rate
since 1982 in the U.S. Education Department's ``State Education
Performance Chart.''
   Minnesota students also tied for third with Montana for highest
American College Testing Program (ACT) scores among the 28 states
that rely upon that test as a benchmark for college preparedness,
with an average score of 19.9 out of 36. The national mean for 1988
was 18.8.
   Randall said teachers, students and lawmakers deserved credit
for the state's 90.6 percent graduation rate. In particular, she
cited a program passed by state legislators in 1987 that kept 2,500
pregnant minors and mothers in high school by offering them
transportation, day care and counseling.
   ``We do care about our schools in Minnesota. There's that
climate here,'' she said.
   ``It's Minnesota's culture. The neat part about Minnesota is
that there's always been a emphasis on learning, exploring,
discovering,'' Senate Education Committee Chairman James Pehler
said.
   He attributed part of the success to annual performance
evaluations of schools conducted with community participation and
the creation of area learning centers or alternative high schools
for students likely to drop out.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich, who likes to refer to himself as the
``education governor,'' said he could not comment on the report
until he reads it.
   Perpich has led the fight for two major education innovations
that have attracted national attention.
   A post-secondary enrollment options program allows Minnesota
high school juniors and seniors to take college courses. And an
open enrollment program allows students to attend the public school
of their choice.
   The open enrollment program has been widely hailed by President
Bush as a model for choice in education.
   Judy Schaubach, secretary-treasurer of the Minnesota Education
Association, said the state's teachers have played a major part in
Minnesota's high rankings.
   ``It shows that the programs we do offer are quality programs,''
she said. ``The teachers aren't just keeping the students in the
classrooms. They're doing something constructive with them.''
   Minnesota pays its teachers an average $29,900 salary, 11th
highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Education Department.
That compares with a national average of $28,000.
   In 1987, the state ranked 17th with $4,180 spent per student.
The national average was $3,977 that year.
   Minnesota had 17.1 students for every teacher in 1988, giving it
a 24th place ranking nationally. The national average is 17.6
students to each teacher.

<TEXT>
   The jogger who lay in a two-week coma after she
was raped and beaten by a gang of youths in Central Park has told a
nurse she wants to run again.
   The woman's emergence from a coma was announced Wednesday by
doctors at Metropolitan Hospital, where she is slowly recovering
from the April 19 attack.
   ``I think we have some pretty good news,'' Dr. Robert S. Kurtz,
assistant chief of surgery and director of surgical intensive care,
said at a news conference.
   Kurtz and Dr. Kent Duffy, chief of neurosurgery, said the woman
had spoken in a hoarse whisper to relatives and staff members on
Tuesday, raised two fingers when asked to do so and was able to
read large flash cards printed with yes, no and her name.
   When hospital staff flashed the signs and she responded, ``three
or four people started clapping. I was one of them,'' Kurtz said.
   And when a nurse told the 28-year-old patient that she would
like to resume jogging, the patient replied, ``Me, too,'' Kurtz
said.
   The woman, an investment banker and a native of a Pittsburgh
suburb, was on her regular jog through Central Park when the youths
pounced on her. Six teen-agers have been indicted on charges of
attempted murder, rape, sodomy and assault. The youths, ages 14 to
16, are being held without bail.
   Barring complications, doctors expect the woman will undergo
weeks or months of slow, steady improvement. She has begun physical
therapy.
   Kurtz and Duffy reiterated that it is unlikely the victim will
ever fully recover.
   The alleged attackers were members of a gang of more than 30
youths that went to the park for a night of ``wilding'' _ random
attacks on anyone they encountered while roaming the area, police
said.
   When told at a City Hall news conference that the victim was
recovering, Mayor Edward I. Koch commented, ``Isn't that
extraordinary. God is good as they say. ... I believe in the power
of prayer. And I know the whole city prayed for this young woman.''

   Two bridge collapses that killed nine
people in two weeks have put a spotlight on highway inspections,
and a U.S. senator says the entire country faces the ``mammoth
task'' of repairing bridges.
   A bridge collapse on April 1 dumped two lanes of U.S. Highway 51
into the Hatchie River about 45 miles north of Memphis, Tenn.,
killing eight people. Two weeks after that, an East Tennessee
teen-ager died when a small, wooden span collapsed in the state.
   ``We need to understand that bridges do get old and wear out and
there has to be enough money, federal and state, to rebuild them
when rebuilding is needed,'' said Les Lamm of the Washington,
D.C.-based Highway Users' Federation.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., who toured the Tennessee bridge site
last month with U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, said
some 240,000 bridges across the country need repairs, and fixing
them could cost more than $50 billion.
   But money is not the only problem, Sasser said.
   ``Our bridge inspection program is chaotic and our bridge repair
program is haphazardly administered,'' he said. ``Sometimes we're
repairing reasonably sound bridges and at the same time neglecting
bridges that are a genuine hazard.''
   Although the federal government pays most of the money for
bridge repairs on major roadways, states conduct the inspections.
   As records of the Tennessee Transportation Department show,
deficiencies pointed out by those inspections are often left
unfixed.
   Inspections of the Hatchie Bridge found evidence of soil erosion
around bridge supports in 1985 and 1987 but nothing was done. The
bridge was checked again in February because of heavy flooding, but
no underwater inspection was made.
   Authorities said the Hatchie Bridge apparently fell because of
erosion, or scouring, around a bridge support. The collapse dumped
four cars and an tractor-trailer into the river and everyone in
those vehicles died.
   Since the collapse, Tennessee officials have stepped up
inspections and have closed four bridges on state-maintained
highways.
   Discussions on bridge safety following the Hatchie collapse have
centered on the lack of nationwide standards for inspection and
repair and on the need for more money.
   ``We've simply got to get the Federal Highway Adminstration
better organized to deal with the mammoth task of renovating this
nation's bridge system,'' Sasser said in remarks prepared for
today's meeting of his Government Affairs Subcommittee on General
Services.
   A decrease in federal money for bridge repairs in recent years
means states must get accustomed to carrying more of the load
themselves, said William Allen, a member of the American Consulting
Engineers Council.
   ``We're starting to realize the magnitude of the job in front of
us, and the states are all scrambling,'' Allen said.
   State and local officials in some areas have even begun talking
about turning over bridges and highways to private companies that
would try to run them for profit, he said.
   Lamm said state and local governments also must realize that
putting off bridge repairs to save money for more politically
urgent projects can be unwise.
   ``It's easy to defer maintenance on any kind of public works
activity because you can let bridge repair or road repaving go for
a couple of years and it doesn't show up right away,'' he said.
   The Hatchie bridge was built in 1934. Authorities say the large
number of deficient bridges around the country is a symptom of the
overall aging of the nation's infrastructure: the roads, bridges,
utility systems, airports and other parts of the physical framework
of modern life.
   Sasser's subcommittee hearing, which was scheduled several
months before the Hatchie Bridge collapse, was called for a general
discussion on the aging infrastructure, but the collapse refocused
the debate on bridges, said Larry Stein, an aide to the senator.

<HEAD>Former Communist Party Leader Edward Ochab Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Ochab, a prominent Communist
official over three decades who briefly served as party first
secretary during the 1956 post-Stalinist thaw, has died, the
government reported. He was 82.
   The official PAP news agency said Ochab had died Monday.
   Ochab joined the prewar Polish Communist Party in 1929.
   He helped defend Warsaw after the Nazis attacked in 1939 and
later escaped to the Soviet Union, where he helped organize the
Union of Polish Patriots that was a precursor of the
Moscow-installed postwar communist government.
   After Moscow-sponsored communists won out in a postwar power
struggle with communists who spent the war fighting inside Poland,
Ochab succeeded to a number of prominent party and government posts.
   When party leader Boleslaw Bierut died during a visit to Moscow
in March 1956, Ochab briefly served as party leader. But labor
turmoil in June of that year and popular resentment of Soviet
influences led him to relinquish leadership in October 1956 to
Wladyslaw Gomulka.
   Gomulka represented the ``national communist'' wing of the party
that had been suppressed by the Moscow faction after the war.
   Ochab remained a party secretary and served as president of the
Council of State from 1964 until 1968, when he quit all his posts.
   In a 1981 interview, he said he had resigned to protest the
``anti-Zionist'' party purge in 1968 directed against Jews and
intellectuals.

<TEXT>
   The woman who preceded Henry Cisneros as
mayor of the nation's ninth-largest city is looking to replace him
come Saturday, when voters in El Paso and Dallas also go to the
polls to elect mayors.
   Former San Antonio Mayor Lila Cockrell is vying to succeed
Cisneros, the popular 41-year-old Hispanic mayor who will enter an
asset management partnership after 14 years of public service,
including eight as mayor.
   Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss, whose city has been rocked by
police shootings, has lost some minority endorsements she received
in her initial race two years ago. This time, though, the business
community is supporting her re-election bid.
   In El Paso, six candidates vying to replace Mayor Jonathan
Rogers _ who by law cannot seek a fifth, two-year term _ say they
want to reduce crime and promote economic development in the border
town.
   But the seven-candidate San Antonio mayor's race seems to be
drawing a great deal of attention around the state because of
Cisneros' departure.
   The 67-year-old Ms. Cockrell, who was mayor from 1975 to 1981,
has said she laid some of the groundwork for Cisneros and now wants
to concentrate on his economic development efforts.
   ``I'm not a spectacular mayor like Henry is, but I have
confidence in myself that I will be a good mayor and that I will
keep the city moving,'' said Ms. Cockrell, who has spent about
$137,000 in her campaign.
   Beset by a troubled marriage and his son's ill health, Cisneros
decided last year against a fifth term.
   He reconsidered his mayoral re-election decision in January
after voters overwhelmingly approved a public transportation tax to
pay for construction of a domed stadium that he supported. But he
decided against running after Ms. Cockrell's supporters said they
would stay behind her.
   The city charter gives the mayor and city council members equal
stature, but because of his personality and leadership skill,
Cisneros turned it into a powerful position as he promoted the city
and rose to national prominence.
   San Antonio, unlike other major Texas cities, was the only
metropolitan area that experienced job growth during the last five
years, although many of those jobs were low-paying, analysts said.
   Also running for mayor here is Carl Mauthe, a 52-year-old
insurance executive who says he offers voters strong management
experience and a choice to a ``recycled mayor.''
   ``I have no baggage. I have no obligations to any group and I'm
not going to bring stale ideas about city government with me and
I'm not going to rubber-stamp everything,'' said Mauthe, who has
raised less than $20,000.
   In Dallas, Mrs. Strauss lost the support of some minority
groups, who have complained of strained relations with city
government and now support one of her three opponents, criminal
defense attorney Peter Lesser.
   Mrs. Strauss, 65, has raised $300,000, compared with the $16,000
raised by Lesser, who discounts the clout of contributions.
   ``Money is not going to win this election. A poor person's vote
counts the same as a millionare's vote,'' said the 41-year-old
Lesser.
   But a poll taken last week by The Dallas Morning News found Mrs.
Strauss was favored by 53 percent of those surveyed in the nation's
eighth-largest city. Lesser was next with 6 percent. Thirty-seven
percent were undecided.
   Two years ago, Mrs. Strauss said promoting economic development
and expanding the police force were her priorities. While the
economy seemed to stabilize during her tenure, the crime rate
escalated, police-related shootings increased and police morale
plummeted.
   ``Dallas has been through some tough times,'' Mrs. Strauss said
recently. ``But we've stood tall and made progress. We are
recapturing the momentum of the '60s, '70s and early '80s and I
want to finish the job I started.''
   The Dallas mayor's post, like the San Antonio job, is mostly
ceremonial. Both pay $50 per weekly council meeting.
   In El Paso, the mayor has more power because there's no city
manager.
   The race has attracted six candidates, including City Council
members Suzie Azar and Ed Elsey and state Rep. Paul Moreno, all
Democrats in the non-partisan election.
   Observers believe Moreno, the only Hispanic running in a city
with a population that's 63 percent Hispanic, will make it to the
May 27 runoff with either Elsey or Ms. Azar. Ms. Azar won
endorsements from both daily newspapers.
   ``El Paso has to get away from the image of the sleepy Mexican
town with low wages,'' said Moreno, who wants to attract state and
federal grants to help small businesses. ``We can't continue to
draw business here by saying they can pay the minimum wage.''
   Ms. Azar, who favors tax abatements, is optimistic the city can
attract more high-tech businesses.
   Elsey, whose economic development plan is similar to Ms. Azar's,
points to two new plants as signs that the city is attracting new
businesses.

<TEXT>
   A deer hunter on trial for the third time
in the shooting death of a wildlife officer during a struggle in
the woods was convicted of a lesser charge of third-degree murder.
   Steve Strange, 26, of Mossy Head, had been charged with
first-degree murder, which could have brought the death penalty or
life behind bars.
   But the jury deliberated six hours Wednesday before returning
the conviction on third-degree murder, which is a death that
results from violently resisting arrest. Strange faces three to 30
years in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for today.
   ``Our judicial system stinks,'' said Ray Barnes, father of the
victim, Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission officer Ray
Lynn Barnes. Strange shot Barnes with officer's own revolver during
a nighttime struggle Nov. 21, 1987.
   The first jury's guilty verdict in Walton County, where the
shooting took place, was thrown out last September because a judge
allowed the panel to use a dictionary while deliberating.
   The case was moved here because of extensive publicity, but a
mistrial was declared in February after a second jury deadlocked.
   Strange did not react when the jury's verdict was read.
   The jury also found Strange guilty of grand theft in taking the
officer's service revolver, possession of firearm during commission
of a felony and hunting without a license.
   In his closing argument, Assistant State Attorney Drew Pinkerton
quoted testimony by Strange's companion, Kenneth Collars, who said
he was hunting near the spot where the defendant struggled with the
state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission officer but didn't see
it.
   Collars testified Tuesday that Strange told him he had
``murdered a man.''
   ``He confessed at that time to one of the highest courts in the
world, his own conscience,'' Pinkerton told the jury.
   The defense contended Strange was only trying to defend himself
after the officer grabbed his shotgun to take it away.
   The prosecution said Barnes was trying to arrest Strange for
hunting without a license. The officer initially suffered a
non-fatal leg wound when Strange's shotgun barrel exploded, the
muzzle blocked by dirt. He subsequently was shot in the chest and
head with his service revolver.
   Loveless contended Strange didn't realize Barnes was a wildlife
officer because he was wearing a camouflage jacket that hid his
uniform shirt.
   Unlike the first two trials, Strange did not testify. A tape
recording of his police interrogation was played for the jury.
   He contended Barnes' gun went off as they struggled. Strange
also left the impression that he realized Barnes was an officer
because of the broad stripes on his trousers.

<TEXT>
   For the second time in a week, ABC has
canceled the scheduled broadcast of a reality-based television
show, pulling ``Scandals II'' from its primetime lineup.
   The one-hour sampler of famous scandals was to have been
broadcast Saturday night, the network said Wednesday.
   The ``Scandals II'' announcement came one day after ABC said it
had removed its ``Crimes of Passion II'' from its schedule last
Saturday after the crime re-enactment program failed to generate
any paid advertising.
   In a statement on the ``Scandals II'' move, ABC Entertainment
President Robert Iger said the network was not bowing to ``outside
pressure groups, lack of advertiser support or complaints by the
persons featured in the program.''
   Rather, Iger said, ``We are currently considering the
appropriate role for reality-based programming on our schedule. In
the interim we will consider each program on a case-by-case basis.''
   The program replacing ``Scandals II'' probably will be a
one-hour drama, said ABC spokesman Jim Brochu.
   The first ``Scandals'' program was one of several fact-based
shows created in the wake of last year's crippling scriptwriters
strike. While some of the shows produced healthy ratings, many were
attacked for lurid content.
   The original ``Scandals,'' broadcast Oct. 29, produced an
unspectacular rating of 8.0, which means that 8 percent of the
nation's homes with television watched the show. But the rating was
good enough to prompt a sequel.
   When it was unable to sell any advertising for ``Crimes of
Passion II,'' ABC was forced to fill the time period with the
lackluster comedy pilots ``Livin' Large'' and ``Heart and Soul.'' A
show that runs without paid advertising would be rated by the A.C.
Nielsen company as zero. A zero would hurt the network's overall
rating during the crucial May sweeps, one of four periods when
ratings are used to determine a local affiliate's advertising rates.
   The network attributed the lack of advertiser interest in
``Crimes of Passion II'' to increased sensitivity about the
depiction of graphic violence and sex on television.
   In recent weeks, advertisers have pulled their commercials from
NBC's Saturday Night Live'' and ``Nightingales'' and the Fox
Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Married ... With Children.'' All three shows
have been criticized by viewers and advocacy groups for their frank
language and sexual situations.

   For the first time in more than 40 years
Poles are going to be able to pick up a daily newspaper not
controlled by the government, and the editors promise to separate
fact from opinion.
   There even will be sports in the Gazeta Wyborcza tabloid, to be
published by the country's Solidarity-led opposition.
   The paper, whose name means ``the election newspaper,'' hopes to
make its debut Monday after a frantic search for offices and the
quick assembly of a staff.
   Deputy editor Ernest Skalski describes it as ``the first
independent daily between the Elbe and the Pacific.''
   Although the paper will have a government censor in the office,
editors say they'll be able to maintain an independent voice.
   Compared to the gray, propaganda-laden dailies put out by the
Communist Party, the government and various official organizations,
Gazeta Wyborcza intends to be lively with short articles and more
foreign news.
   ``Polish dailies are in my opinion very bad. ... They make even
good news look so boring,'' said Helena Luczywo, a deputy editor
who for seven years put out the leading underground weekly,
Tygodnik Mazowsze. ``Even if there is something interesting they
tend to put in all kinds of official visits, statements and
speeches, and three-quarters of the paper is this.''
   ``We really hope to put the interesting and hot news where it
can be seen by everyone. Besides, I think the selection of news is
going to be totally different,'' she said.
   The eight-page newspaper will start out by reporting on the June
parliamentary elections, and continue as a daily with an opposition
editorial viewpoint.
   But it plans to make a clear distinction between straight
information and editorializing, Ms. Luczywo said.
   Although Poland has had a vibrant underground press for more
than a decade, editions were put out at best only weekly and with
limited press runs of 20,000 to 30,000 copies.
   Under an agreement reached in April between the government and
Solidarity, the opposition will be allowed to publish a
500,000-circulation daily. The newspaper will be printed on state
presses and sold in state-owned kiosks.
   Access to the mass media was one of the opposition's conditions
for joining in the agreement, which calls for the opposition to
participate in the parliament elections. It also legalized
Solidarity, the independent trade union movement, after a
seven-year ban.
   ``Our paper is not the Solidarity trade union's paper but it
aspires to be the paper of the whole opposition,'' said Skalski.
   Skalski said the last time Poland had a daily newspaper
independent of Communist Party control was before the party
consolidated power in 1947.
   The editor-in-chief is to be Adam Michnik, an essayist and
historian who is one of the leading theoreticians of the
opposition. He was assigned the task by Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa.
   The staff will number about 50 and include people from the now
liquidated Tygodnik Mazowsze, which means weekly of the Mazowsze
region that includes Warsaw. Also on the staff are students and
recent graduates of Warsaw University's journalism school.
   Many of the country's best-known independent journalists also
will contribute articles from time to time, said Ms. Luczywo.
   The newspaper is also to have a section that will contain news
about a faction of the opposition that is against compromise with
the authorities _ in other words, the political rivals of Walesa
and the paper's editors.
   Ms. Luczywo said the section ``most likely to be censored'' will
contain foreign news, which will concentrate on changes in the East
bloc.
   Preparations for publishing began the day Solidarity and the
government signed their agreement.
   After several false starts, the paper finally received offices
from authorities Tuesday in a vacant children's nursery in southern
Warsaw.
   At midweek, it was still waiting for phone and telex
connections, Ms. Luczywo said.
   Technically, the paper is the property of a company set up with
three shareholders: Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak,
filmmaker Andrzej Wajda and Aleksander Paszysnski, founder of the
pro-private enterprise Economic Society. Initial financing is
coming from a bank loan and the newspaper hopes later to accept
advertising.
   For Ms. Luczywo, leaving the underground press for Gazeta
Wyborcza has meant the freedom to use the telephone instead of
couriers.
   But she is having trouble picturing a censor at her elbow while
she edits.
   ``I've never seen a censor in my life,'' she said, laughing at
the thought. ``I've been working for the uncensored press since
1977, for 12 years. So now I'm kind of losing my virginity.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Baby Sitter Put Pins in Food to Impress Parents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 42-year-old baby sitter was trying to
impress her employers with her vigilance when she put straight pins
in a 6-month-old child's baby food and reported it as food
tampering, officials say.
   Barbara Rexroad ``wanted to show the parents that she was taking
care of (the child) and watching out for him,'' said Police Chief
Mike Walton.
   Mrs. Rexroad was charged Wednesday with communication of false
information of tainting of a consumer product, a felony carrying a
maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, said
U.S. Attorney J. William Roberts.
   The woman was released on her own recognizance after a hearing
before U.S. Magistrate Charles Evans. A preliminary hearing was set
for May 23.
   She declined to comment when she left the federal courthouse,
but her attorney, Michael Metnick, told the magistrate,``There was
never any intent that these pins would be fed or further
transmitted in interstate commerce.''
   Roberts said the woman admitted Monday under questioning by
police and FBI agents that she planted the pins in the two jars of
Heinz baby food and made up the story. She surrendered Wednesday
afternoon after a criminal complaint was filed, he said.
   Heinz baby food was pulled from store shelves in Springfield
after the false report Friday night, but was placed back on sale
this week after local officials consulted with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration.
   A second report of tampering involving Heinz baby food surfaced
Monday in Jacksonville, less than 30 miles west of Springfield, but
a Heinz official called it ``a copycat event'' and said the company
would push for vigorous prosecution.
   ``This type of event undermines the integrity of the products we
produce, and that's not something we plan to stand by and watch,''
said David W. Lance, security manager for Pittsburgh-based Heinz
U.S.A.
   In a third food-tampering incident in central Illinois, a
shoe-store manager who said candy he purchased at a mall vending
machine contained sharp metal pieces was charged Wednesday with
making a false report.
   Kevin Gentry, 26, had said that he bit into a piece of candy and
cut his mouth Tuesday.
   Deputies confiscated chocolate-covered candies with two small
pointed objects in them but became suspicious of the report
``almost immediately,'' said Macon County Sheriff's Capt. Tom
Pierce.
   Seven candy machines in the Hickory Point Mall in Forsyth, just
north of Decatur, had been locked away after Gentry's tampering
report.

<HEAD>Shells, Rockets Fired Despite Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Howitzer shells and rockets fired from
Syrian-policed west Beirut crashed along the coast of a Christian
area north of the city today despite a cease-fire brokered by the
Arab League.
   A police spokesman said the artillery fire hit the beach of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave at the rate of four per hour. No
casualties were reported.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing rules,
said the barrage was ``obviously an attempt to maintain the
blockade'' of Christian ports.
   Gunners of Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000-strong Christian army units
did not return fire, the spokesman said.
   Aoun, also head of the Christian cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, on Wednesday accepted a truce that involves lifting the
blockades he imposed on illegal ports run by Moslem militias, said
Arab League envoys Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria and Abdel-Aziz
Al-Jassem of Syria.
   They said Aoun's Sunni Moslem rival and Cabinet leader Salim
Hoss also agreed to the cease-fire.
   The Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio station quoted Jassem
as saying today the agreement was ``not a magic stick that can
block the barrel of each cannon to silence it.''
   ``We will ask leaders in west Beirut why the cease-fire is not
being honored,'' Jassem was quoted as saying.
   The Arab envoys spent the night at a hotel in the Christian
mountain resort of Brummana, northeast of Beirut. They crossed
Beirut's dividing Green Line this morning for meetings with Moslem
leaders in the city's western sector.
   On Wednesday, the ferry service between the Christian enclave
and Cyprus resumed, with the Baroness M taking on about 400
passengers. The service had been suspended while the port of
Jounieh north of Beirut was shelled.
   The captain of the Cypriot-flagged ferry remained 15 miles
offshore because he was skeptical about guarantees the vessel would
not be shelled, and small boats shuttled passengers to the ferry.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, Syria's main ally in the
confrontation with Aoun, on Wednesday demanded measures to block
alleged weapon supplies from Iraq to Aoun through the Christian
ports.
   ``There is no justification for any shot to be fired in Lebanon
as of now,'' Ibrahimi said Wednesday after meeting separately with
Aoun and Hoss.
   ``I can say the cease-fire has taken effect today after the
settlement of ports dispute. The observer force will begin arriving
soon,'' he said without elaborating.
   The truce, announced Friday after an emergency meeting of Arab
foreign ministers in Tunisia, calls for a group of military
observers from Arab nations to monitor implementation of the
cease-fire.
   Aoun had welcomed the decision, saying the observers would
``watch the Syrians here.''
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces as well as in west and south
Beirut under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab league.
   The current round of violence broke out on March 8, two days
after Aoun ordered a blockade of the ports run by Syria's two main
allies _ Jumblatt's militia and Amal, led by Shiite Moslem leader
Nabih Berri.
   Aoun's army blockaded two of Jumblatt's ports and Druse and
Syrian gunners _ who outnumber Christian forces by 3-1 _ retaliated
by firing at Christian ports then besieged the Christian enclave.
   The Amal militia has not joined in.

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced To Lifetime Birth Control Has Fourth Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 19-year-old woman whose sentence on child abuse
charges had included an order for lifetime birth control recently
gave birth to her fourth child, officials said.
   Debra Ann Forster had pleaded guilty April 4, 1988, to two
counts of attempted child abuse for leaving her two sons, then 7
months and 18 months old, in her sweltering suburban Mesa apartment
unattended for three days in May 1987. When her estranged husband
and father of the children found them, they were severely
dehydrated and one was near death, according to court testimony.
The boys recovered.
   The judge who sentenced Ms. Forster in May 1988 lifted the birth
control condition of the probation sentence in August as
unenforceable when she learned Ms. Forster was pregnant.
   The probation term ordered by Judge Lindsay Ellis of Maricopa
County Superior Court also barred Ms. Forster from caring for any
child.
   Ms. Forster's probation officer, Lori Scott, confirmed Wednesday
that Ms. Forster gave birth last week, but she would not disclose
the date or location.
   ``It's a very delicate situation,'' the probation officer said,
adding that the judge ordered her not to release any details on the
case.
   A daughter born in March 1988, while Ms. Forster was in jail
awaiting resolution of her case, was put up for adoption. The two
boys were put in the state's custody.
   Ms. Ellis said Wednesday that the infant's fate is likely to be
``decided largely by Child Protective Services and perhaps
ultimately by Juvenile Court.''
   The judge would not say who is caring for the infant, but said
she has been assured it is not Ms. Forster.
   She declined to discuss the case further.
   Ms. Forster's stepfather, Joseph Lantier of Patterson, La., said
Wednesday he spoke with his stepdaughter on Tuesday and that she
gave birth to a healthy girl. He would not say what her intentions
were regarding the baby.
   ``It's a controversial case, and I'm not going to say anything
to jeopardize her,'' said Lantier.
   Lantier cared for Ms. Forster from age 10 to 15 in Louisiana.
Ms. Forster, a seventh-grade dropout, married at 15 and had her
first child at that age.
   In October, Ms. Ellis denied Ms. Forster permission to travel to
New York to appear on Phil Donahue's television show. The probation
order prohibited Ms. Forster from leaving Arizona without court
permission, and the judge said in October that allowing Ms. Forster
to appear on the show ``would be like throwing her into the mouths
of sharks.''
   Ms. Forster has reconciled with her husband and is attempting to
complete her high school education, Scott said.

<HEAD>Roy Williams Eulogized as Supporter of the Working Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Teamsters President Roy Lee
Williams was remembered as an aggressive leader who cared for the
disadvantaged and fought for the cause of the workingman.
   ``He was strong,'' said Danny Johnson, who now holds the
positions Williams occupied for nearly 30 years as president of
Teamsters Local 41 and Joint Council 56. ``He was aggressive. He
was a fighter who believed in the workingman's cause. He was tough
as nails at the negotiating table.''
   About 150 people attended Wednesday's memorial service for
Williams, who served as the leader of the Teamsters for three
years. Williams, 74, died Friday at his farm home about 70 miles
southeast of Kansas City. He had been ill with emphysema and an
enlarged heart.
   Williams also had a way of caring for the disadvantaged that has
long been overlooked, Johnson said in a brief eulogy.
   Williams' problems received news coverage, but Johnson said ``it
galls me sometimes that the news media doesn't recognize the good
things he did, such as his support for retarded children and the
Muscular Dystrophy foundation.''
   Williams was convicted in 1982 of conspiring to bribe then-Sen.
Howard Cannon in Nevada to get Cannon to scuttle a trucking
deregulation bill.
   In court testimony, Williams admitted that during his reign at
Local 41, he had been controlled by Nick Civella, the late Kansas
City crime leader. Williams also predicted that organized crime
would shadow the union nationally for a ``long time after I'm
gone.''
   Williams served three years in federal prison, and was released
last September. Friends and associates who visted him at his
Leeton, Mo., farm, said Williams maintained his innocence to the
end.
   Williams began as a trucker in 1935, hauling livestock to
Chicago. Twice decorated for bravery in World War II, he returned
to the Midwest and took control of a troubled Teamsters local in
Wichita.
   With the support of Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa, Williams in
1952 took over Local 41, and in 1954 was elected president of the
local and Joint Council 56, a coalition of area Teamsters locals.
He held those positions until 1981, when he was elected
international vice president. Later that year, he succeeded Frank
Fitzsimmons as Teamsters general president.

   Their independent unions spurned by Communist
leaders, tens of thousands of students pushed through police lines
today into central Tiananmen Square on the 70th anniversary of
China's first student movement.
   Thousands also demonstrated in Shanghai and Nanjing for
democracy and press freedom while several hundred took to the
streets in Changsha. Three hundred journalists from the state-run
press joined the march in Beijing.
   Students plowed into Tiananmen _ China's symbolic seat of power
_ throughout the day.
   By mid-afternoon, more than 70,000 people, about half of them
students, packed the 100-acre expanse in a collage of chanting,
flag-waving and singing.
   Red and white banners calling for freedoms unheard of in China
since the Communists came to power 40 years ago flapped in the wind.
   Bystanders, lining the streets by the thousands, had applauded
and cheered the demonstrators as they marched along the 10-mile
route to the square.
   It was the sixth time in three weeks that students have made the
pilgrimage to demand fundamental reforms of China's autocratic
political system.
   ``If this continues, China has hope,'' said one onlooker.
   Thousands of workers ignored government warnings that they would
be fired if they attended the march, said one government employee.
   ``This is the first time in 40 years such a big movement for
democracy has occurred. I'll just show up at work tomorrow and see
what happens,'' he said.
   About an hour before the protest ended and students left the
square, their leaders announced that students' two-week old class
boycott would end Friday.
   At least 55 schools participated in today's march, including
small delegations from more than 10 schools outside Beijing
including Hong Kong's Chinese University.
   In a statement read at the square, student leaders reiterated
their demands for a dialogue with the government. They had called
today's march after authorities on Wednesday refused to recognize
their newly formed union and open up a dialogue with democratically
elected student representatives.
   The government has called the student demands ``naive and
impulsive'' and called the students' United Association of Beijing
Universities illegal.
   Police today put up far less resistance than during last
Thursday's protest, when 150,000 students and supporters marched to
the square in Communist China's biggest demonstration ever.
   But outside Beijing Normal University, thousands of students
came up against a wall of several hundred police and there was much
pushing and shoving during which police grabbed protesters' hair
before the students broke through.
   Students and 1,000 police collided again in front of the Beijing
Hotel when protesters from colleges in the eastern part of the city
moved toward the square. After several tries, they too plowed
through police lines.
   Students walked hand-in-hand down Beijing's broad boulevards.
Some wore red headbands reading, ``Mom, I'm not wrong.''
   ``Rise ye who refuse to be slaves,'' a group of students
bellowed, singing the Chinese national anthem, as they passed the
Communist Party headquarters at Zhongnanhai.
   ``Down with bureaucracy,'' others chanted.
   The headquarters was the scene of a dramatic stand-off between
students and hundreds of police two weeks ago. Thursday, only four
guards stood at the gates.
   By early afternoon, police presence had all but vanished from
Tiananmen. A banner reading, ``The world is for all,'' was hung
over a huge portrait of Sun Yat-sen, who led China's first
revolution in 1911. The portrait was erected earlier this week in
the square for annual May Day celebrations.
   ``Every country demands democracy,'' said a teacher from the
Central Academy of Industrial Arts. ``Democracy is developing here,
too.''
   Three hundred journalists from the state press held an
unprecedented protest at the official Xinhua News Agency, calling
for a free press. Some said they had been locked inside their
offices and had to sneak out to take part.
   The group later joined the student march, carrying banners
supporting Qin Benli, the editor of a liberal Shanghai newspaper,
the World Economic Herald. Qin was sacked last week after his paper
was critical of the government.
   ``Our mouths cannot say what we want them to,'' said one banner.
   As the protest ended, student leader Wu'er Kaixi urged students
to continue their efforts to inform citizens about their movement.
   Students gathered contributions from the crowds and gave out
pamphlets explaining their movement.
   ``We need the support of the people!'' yelled one young man as
bystanders stuffed bills into his box. ``Without the people, we can
do nothing.''
   In Shanghai, about 7,000 students gathered near Communist Party
offices with banners calling for democracy. Witnesses said
onlookers were kept from the protest. In Nanjing, about 1,000
university students marched to the provincial government
headquarters, another witness said.
   And in Changsha, capital of Hunan province, about 300 students
marched in sympathy of the Beijing rally, an American teacher said.
   In contrast to last week's march, when students were angered by
the government's opposition to their demands for democracy and
freedom, today's march had an air of defiant celebration.
   ``Today is a holiday, and we are here to remember May 4th,''
said one student.
   On May, 4, 1919, Beijing University students launched a campaign
for science and democracy, showing intellectuals for the first time
their power to lead the masses and affect policy.

   Labor unions will gain the right to strike in new
legislation designed to free them from decades of meek subservience
to the Communist Party and government, a leading Soviet union
official said.
   Unions ``must have the right to stop work at enterprises, in
organizations and institutions as a means of pressure on the
administration for speeding up the resolution of labor disputes,''
Stepan A. Shalaev told the labor newspaper Trud in an interview
published Wednesday.
   But Shalaev made clear that the Central Council of Trade Unions
that he chairs does not expect strikes to become as common as they
are elsewhere.
   ``The decision to stop work at an enterprise _ this is an
extreme measure to be taken only in extreme circumstances,'' he
said.
   Shalaev said the draft law, published Saturday, would be
discussed by unions for three months. It must eventually be
approved by the new Supreme Soviet Parliament, which is considered
likely.
   Giving unions a limited right to strike appeared to be an effort
to prevent labor unrest from taking on the dimension that led to
the formation of the Solidarity free trade union movement in Poland.
   Solidarity was crushed in a 1981 military crackdown and not
reinstated until last month.
   Under current Soviet law, unions are not permitted to strike.
Instead, they are quiet partners with management and the ruling
Communist Party. Communist ideology considers strikes a Western
phenomenon stemming from worker exploitation.
   Soviet unions have assumed a variety of functions such as
building and organizing housing for members or running vacation
facilities for members. They traditionally have done nothing to
advance wage demands and work conditions.
   Shalaev said unions would be free of government interference
under the draft law and workers protected from losing their jobs as
a result of union activity. The law also ensures that local union
officials are independent of the administration of the factory or
office where they work, he said.
   In an article Monday, the international May Day holiday, an
economist wrote in the newspaper Socialist Industry that the
country's union system has done nothing to help workers.
   Alexander Auzan wrote that unions are subservient to the
government and are ``concerned not with defending the interests of
the workers but only with maintaining peace and quiet and an
imitation of `mass support.'''
   However, that has not prevented labor unrest from spreading in
certain industries as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic
reforms take hold and greater openness encourages Soviets to speak
out on issues that affect them.
   In March, more than 100 coal miners in the Ural Mountains city
of Vorkuta struck to protest increased work orders, demand
replacement of the facility's director and chief economist and
changes in the salary system.
   In April, miners stayed underground in the Siberian city of
Norilsk to demand a 30 percent wage increase.
   In both cases, the strikes drew the attention of the government
ministers in Moscow, who promised to meet some of the strikers'
demands.

   A homeless man accused of killing nine
people by setting the most deadly residential fire in Peoria
history has pleaded innocent to nine counts of first-degree murder
and two counts of arson.
   James Pickens entered the plea in a brief appearance Wednesday
before Peoria County Circuit Judge Richard Eagleton. A trial was
scheduled for June 26.
   Pickens, 34, was named in nine murder indictments and two
indictments of aggravated arson Tuesday by a Peoria County grand
jury.
   State's Attorney Kevin Lyons said he is considering seeking the
death penalty if Pickens is convicted.
   According to police, Pickens, who has no permanent address, was
at a Peoria house on April 11 when residents asked him to leave so
they could go to bed. Authorities say he has confessed to returning
later and setting a roll-away bed afire in a vacant ground-floor
apartment while 12 people slept on the second floor.
   Seven children and two adults were killed and three others were
injured. Those who died ranged in age from two months to 27 years.
Authorities said they died of smoke inhalation.
   Pickens is being held in the Peoria County Jail on $2 million
bond.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today she
feels a sense of pride and achievement as she looks back on 10
years in power and that she has ``no thought of slowing down.''
   Speaking to reporters from the steps of her offices at No. 10
Downing Street, the 63-year-old prime minister said there were
things she might have done differently but that overall Britain is
better off.
   ``The standard of living for almost everyone is higher,'' she
said. ``I think everyone recognizes that Britain's standing in the
world is greater than it's been for many a very long year.''
   When she was asked for a second time how long she hopes to
remain in power, Mrs. Thatcher cut short the questioner and said:
   ``Look, right now we just carry on and take each day and do our
very best with it. I haven't got any better crystal ball than you
have.
   ``There's no thought of slowing down because we've built a
marvelous basis and we want to go on,'' she said in remarks
broadcast live on British Broadcasting Corp. television.
   Public opinion polls indicate that while most Britons respect
the prime minister, many also dislike her, and some local elections
today were expected to be rough going for some of Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservatives.
   Mrs. Thatcher took office as Europe's first woman prime minister
on May 4, 1979, when the victory of her Conservative Party in the
general election the previous day was declared.
   The Conservatives ousted the Socialist Labor government of James
Callaghan after a winter of strikes left the dead unburied and
garbage piled high in the streets.
   She has since won two more terms, pursuing a right-wing
revolution that has emasculated the labor unions and increased
prosperity for many people.
   But critics charge Thatcherism made the poor poorer, encouraged
greed and divided the nation.
   The Independent (independent) said in an editorial today: ``If
Mrs. Thatcher does not pause to reflect upon her present course,
she will ... damage the nation.''
   The Conservatives looked set, according to polls, to lose a
Welsh parliamentary district in a special election today,
reflecting widespread opposition to her plans for radical reforms
of the free National Health Service.
   Voting was also taking place today in 47 county council
elections in England and Wales, with both the Conservatives and the
main opposition Labor Party likely to gain from a slump in support
for the squabbling center parties.
   Local opinion polls in the parliamentary district, the Vale of
Glamorgan, Tory territory for 38 years, indicated the Conservative
candidate were trailing between 8 and 11 points behind Labor.
   A Harris poll in London's Observer, a liberal weekly, showed
that although 58 percent of those questioned want Mrs. Thatcher to
step down now or within a couple of years, only 7 percent believe
she actually will.
   In a Gallup sounding, 67 percent said they dislike Mrs. Thatcher
personally, about the same as the 63 percent who said they respect
her.

<DATELINE>SITE B REFUGEE CAMP, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle
toured a remote refugee camp for Cambodians today and told
thousands of people pleading for return to their homeland their
plight is ``a tragedy, a human tragedy.''
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, traveled more than 2{ hours by
plane and helicopter, carrying a message that ``you have not been
forgotten'' to the camp known as Site B deep in the brush six miles
from the Thai-Cambodian border.
   Nearing the end of a four-nation, 12-day trip through the
Pacific and Asia, Quayle held small children and spoke to thousands
who have fled the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.
   ``Today is to call the attention of the world to what is going
on. These poor kids here, the sick, some of them born here, want to
return to their home,'' he told reporters outside a cluster of
thatched houses. ``And yet they can't because of the illegal
occupation'' by Vietnamese troops.
   Secret Service agents armed with assault rifles guarded the
Quayle party as the vice president and his wife shook hands and
touched some of the tens of thousands of people who turned out to
cheer them in the burning heat.
   Quayle originally was scheduled to visit Site 2, another major
refugee camp south of Site B, but sporadic shellings of Site 2 over
the past two weeks prompted officials to cancel that trip.
   The last major event on Quayle's trip, the visit to the refugee
camp underscored his emphasis on promoting U.S. efforts to promote
a settlement of the decade-old Cambodian war and its support for
non-communist guerrillas led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and by Son
Sann.
   At a departure news conference in Bangkok later, Quayle said the
United States may supply weapons to those resistance groups in
order to give them more leverage with both the Vietnamese-backed
government in Cambodia and their powerful allies, the Khmer Rouge.
   Vietnam has promised to pull its forces out of Cambodia this
fall.
   ``Now is the time we want to go forward with the one goal: an
independent and free Cambodia and the best way to achieve that is
to enhance and increase the effectiveness and the influence of the
non-Communist resistance and that's what we intend to do,'' Quayle
said.
   After a brief stop in Japan today, Quayle was leaving for
Alaska, where he will witness cleanup efforts from the March 24
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound.
   Children waving miniature American, Cambodian and Thai flags
lined the dirt road for two miles to greet Quayle as he drove up to
Site B, home to about 60,000 Cambodians. The camp is the main
civilian camp controlled by the forces of Sihanouk, who ruled
Cambodia for three decades before a 1970 coup.
   ``Despite the long years of struggle, you have not been
forgotten in America,'' Quayle told a crowd of about 10,000 as an
interpreter translated into the Cambodian language. ``The plight of
the Cambodian people is something that has been overlooked, it's a
tragedy, a human tragedy.''
   Afterward, the vice president visited a medical center at the
camp, where mothers on bamboo beds gathered their children near
them.
   In talks with Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan on
Wednesday, Quayle restated the U.S. opposition to any dominant role
in Cambodia's future for the third guerrilla group, the communist
Khmer Rouge, which massacred hundreds of thousands of people when
it ruled Cambodia until Vietnam's 1978 invasion.
   A senior aide to the vice president, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Chatichai and Quayle discussed proposals for the
United States to provide arms to the non-communist factions, a
policy option being debated in Washington.
   Quayle arrived in Thailand on Wednesday as the most senior
American official to visit since Vice President Walter Mondale in
1978. Quayle, accompanied by his wife Marilyn, also has visited
Australia, Indonesia and Singapore on his trip.
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, Quayle met with Sihanouk, whom the United
States wants to head a transition government after Vietnam
withdraws. Vietnam has pledged to remove all its troops by Sept. 30.
   On Wednesday evening, Quayle explained the basic U.S. position
on Cambodia in the 50-minute meeting with Chatichai. He also
stressed the importance the United States places on protection of
copyrights _ perhaps the only major friction in otherwise close
ties between the two countries.
   Unlicensed reproductions of American video movies, designer
clothes, computer software and pharmaceutical products are openly
sold in Thailand.
   Thai officials say laws exist to protect intellectual property
but enforcement is still difficult. The United States, however, is
considering retaliatory measures.
   Thai government spokesman Suvit Yoadmanee quoted Chatichai as
telling Quayle that the issue should not be allowed to mar overall
relations. He said the most recent negotiations had proceeded well.

<TEXT>
   The Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant has
cleared a final obstacle to winning a low-power operating license
later this month, but opponents say they will appeal any decision
to start the reactor.
   The financially fragile reactor moved closer to licensing when
late Wednesday the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
it was satisfied that the plant owners could come up with $72.1
million in decommissioning costs. The money assures the plant would
be safely taken out of operation should it be tested with
radioactive fuel but never operated commercially.
   The NRC had said the financial decommissioning issue was the
last in a long series of regulatory obstacles that has prevented
Seabrook from getting its low-power license for 2{ years. The
emotional 20-year battle over the Seabrook plant has served as a
rallying point for the anti-nuclear power movement.
   The $6 billion plant could receive the long-sought license,
which allows testing at up to 5 percent of capacity, as early as
late next week if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission does not impose
a stay on the license pending appeals.
   The NRC will give opponents five days to file requests for a
stay and another four days for Seabrook officials to respond. The
commissioners said they would rule on stay motions
``expeditiously'' and that the license would not be issued until
the NRC has ruled on the requests.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon and other plant
opponents said they would file for a stay and appeal the case to
federal court.
   But any legal challenge will become moot without an emergency
stay from either the NRC or the court because Seabrook officials
are ready to act swiftly on low-power tests.
   Seabrook spokesman Ronald A. Sher has said plant operators are
ready to begin a 10-day ``warm up'' period, a precursor to
low-power testing, within 24 hours of receiving the license.
   After that, plant officials would conduct 10 days of low-power
tests, ranging from 0.01 percent of the plant's capacity to 3
percent capacity. It would be the equivalent of running the plant
at full power for 45 minutes, Sher said.
   Sher said Seabrook officials do not believe the opponents can
further delay a low-power license. He predicted the license would
be issued later this month.
   Shannon predicted the license issue will end up in court within
weeks.
   In a telephone interview Wednesday night, the attorney general
lambasted the NRC staff decision as ``just another example of
bureaucrats in Washington riding roughshod over our health and
safety.''
   Shannon said his appeal would be based largely on the financial
difficulties facing the plant's chief owner and the possibility
that the reactor will never receive a commercial operating license.
   The staff decision, announced after regular business hours at 6
p.m., came just hours after the NRC voted 5-0 to reject a request
by Massachusetts officials to hold new hearings on the license.
State officials argued that the lack of an approved site where the
plant could haul its low-level radioactive waste could increase the
project's cost and should be examined.
   To meet the decommissioning fund requirement, Seabrook owners
paid Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. of Hartford, Conn., $8.5 million
to insure any part of the estimated $72.1 million that the owners
could not come up with themselves. The staff ruled Wednesday that
the bond guarantee was acceptable.

<HEAD>Hanford 1949 Test Released More Radiation Than Expected, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A secret 1949 experiment at the Hanford
nuclear reservation released about twice as much radioactive gas as
scientists had predicted beforehand, according to a newly
declassified report.
   The report said the so-called Green Run experiment released
about 7,780 curies of radioactive iodine and about 20,000 curies of
xenon-133, a gas.
   By contrast, the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, the worst
commercial nuclear accident in the United States, emitted 15 to 24
curies of radioactive iodine into the Pennsylvania countryside.
   Scientists had estimated in 1949 that the test would release
about 4,000 curies of iodine and 7,900 curies of xenon. The
increased radiation measurements may have been caused by an
unstable weather inversion over the region, the report said.
   The Spokane Chronicle and Spokesman-Review, two of several
newspapers that requested the report's release, published details
of its contents in articles Wednesday and today.
   The Dec. 2, 1949 experiment, the only known non-accidental
release of radiation in Hanford's post-World War II history, spread
radiation in a 40-by 200-mile plume to Spokane and as far south as
Klamath Falls, Ore., near the California border.
   It's not known how much radiation residents actually were
exposed to, since the public was never notified and no follow-up
health studies were done.
   Scientists are now starting a study to see if Hanford emissions
in the 1940s and '50s, including the Green Run, have led to an
increase in thyroid disease in the area.
   Some details of the Green Run test were included in a Hanford
nuclear reservation environmental monitoring report that was among
19,000 pages of previously secret documents made public by the
Department of Energy in 1986. But a more detailed 120-page report
on other aspects of the experiment was not released until this
week. Some segments of the report were deleted for security
reasons, the government said.
   The Green Run experiment was apparently conducted to help
develop efforts to detect emerging military plutonium production in
the Soviet Union. The contamination exceeded the Atomic Energy
Commission's ``tolerance thresholds'' for iodine-131 on vegetation
by tens of thousands of times on the nuclear reservation and by
hundreds of times in nearby communities.

<HEAD>Man Found on Raft Says Fumes From Rotting Fish Killed Two Crew Mates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bodies of two crewmen were found aboard a
disabled tuna boat, and a crew member who abandoned the vessel told
the Coast Guard his companions were overcome by fumes of rotting
fish.
   Lawrence Moon, a Yap islander found drifting in a life raft
Tuesday, told officials he abandoned the tuna boat Margaret G after
the fumes felled the two other men ``in a matter of seconds,'' said
Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.
   Spangler said the men may have been overcome by hydrogen
sulfide, which is produced by rotting organic material.
   The Coast Guard began towing the 85-foot, Seattle-based vessel
to Hawaii on Wednesday, said another Coast Guard spokesman, David
Goff. The 300-mile trip could take three to four days because the
tuna boat has rudder problems, he said.
   The Coast Guard investigation was complicated by the fact that
hydrogen sulfide is highly combustible, Spangler said.
   Moon, who said he joined the Margaret G before it left American
Samoa on April 23, told authorities the boat's refrigeration system
was not operating when it left the U.S. territory about 2,300 miles
south of Hawaii. The boat was carrying 13 to 15 tons of tuna it had
been unable to sell in port, Goff said.
   Moon said the three crew members dumped five to six tons of
rotten fish into the Pacific Ocean between April 25 and 27, but had
to stop when the heat and smell became too intense.
   The skipper was overcome by fumes Sunday when he went into the
fish well and the other crewman was also overcome when he went to
help the skipper, Moon said.
   Fearing the fumes endangered his life, Moon boarded a life raft
Monday after the ship's electric generator failed. His raft was
spotted Tuesday by a Coast Guard plane following an emergency
distress beacon signal.
   Yap, part of the Federated States of Micronesia, is about 540
miles southwest of Guam.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Immigration official granted political
asylum to a Nicaraguan immigrant after the man won $5.3 million in
the Florida lottery.
   Justo Ricardo Somarriba, a $3.50-an-hour hardware store clerk
who entered the country illegally in 1987, picked up his first
annual check of $240,000 in Tallahassee on Monday after picking all
six numbers in Florida's Lotto drawing Saturday.
   On Wednesday, after U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials revealed that the State Department had failed to support
Somarriba's request for political asylum, INS district director
Perry Rivkind reviewed the case and decided Somarriba and his
family deserved legal residency.
   ``I never expected this would happen in this country,''
Somarriba said of his family's newfound protected-immigrant status
as well as its financial windfall. ``It's just great.''
   Somarriba probably would face repression if he returned to
Nicaragua, said Rivkind, adding, ``This has nothing to do with the
jackpot.''
   ``He was a teacher in the government education department, and
there is no question he resisted Sandinista propagandizing in the
school system,'' Rivkind said. ``That clearly gives hims a
well-founded fear of persecution.''
   Rivkind then joked: ``Now that he is a captialist, I think the
Marxists would like him even less.''
   Somarriba quit his job after confirming his winnings and said he
hoped to use the money to bring the rest of his family from
Nicaragua and open his own hardware store in the United States.
   Like about 40,000 other Nicaraguans in Florida, Somarriba was
employed under a special work permit while waiting for his asylum
application to be processed.
   Early last year, the State Department refused to support
Somarriba's petition, saying it had insufficient information.
   Rivkind said the State Department, which previously made
yes-or-no recommendations on almost all such applications, has
lately avoided making decisions on about half of the requests sent
its way.
   Even if Somarriba's request had been denied, however, it is
unlikely he would have been deported.
   Deportation notices must be approved by the Justice Department,
and so far the agency has returned only convicted criminals to
Nicaragua, said Rivkind, adding the remaining deportation requests
are simply stalled in Washington.
   In addition, anyone who is denied asylum can appeal that
decision, a process that usually takes one to two years.
   Lottery officials said even if he hadn't received asylum he
would have gotten to keep the money.
   Somarriba, from Masaya, Nicaragua, about 90 miles south of
Managua, entered the United States in March 1987 by crossing the
Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, said Richard Smith, deputy INS
director.
   He lives with his wife, Maria Elena, and three children, Rosa
Elena, 9, Maria, 7, and Yuliza, 3.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Ferdinand Marcos
supporters staged a rally in Manila today to mark one year since
the death of his still-unburied mother and to demand the ousted
president be allowed to return.
   Police in San Juan, a Manila suburb, said 2,000 pro-Marcos
protesters marched to the former president's former home where a
Mass was celebrated in honor of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos,
who died last year at 95.
   The protesters then held a rally at a downtown square where they
made speeches extolling Marcos and demanding his return from exile.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died in a Manila military hospital May 4,
1988, but her family has refused to bury her until President
Corazon Aquino allows Marcos to return from his Hawaiian exile to
preside over the funeral.
   Officials in Marcos' hometown, Batac, 250 miles north of Manila,
declared today as a ``day of mourning.'' Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body
has been lying in an open casket in the Marcos ancestral home,
which has been turned into a museum.
   About 400 people packed the living room of the two-story home to
listen to sermons by local priests reminiscing about Marcos'
20-year rule. At least three Masses were said, one lasting four
hours. A Protestant service was also held.
   The Rev. Domingo Nebres said he visited Marcos last week in
Honolulu. Marcos, hospitalized since last January for respiratory
and heart ailments, was optimistic that he would be able to return
to the Philippines, Nebres said.
   ``Just wait for me. I will definitely come home. While there is
life, there is hope,'' Nebres quoted Marcos as telling him.
   Batac Mayor Jesus Nalupta said no special ceremonies were
scheduled apart from Roman Catholic Masses, which have been said
nearly every day since Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body was brought from
Manila last year.
   Private radio station DZXL in Manila broadcast a taped message
from Marcos' wife, Imelda, saying her mother-in-law's soul is still
on earth ``to carry out God's will to bring home her son.''
   Mrs. Marcos said she hopes she will soon be allowed to return.
She spoke in Tagalog with the theme music from a soap opera playing
in the background.
   Mrs. Marcos said she receives calls from employees at the
presidential palace who say they often see Mrs. Edralin-Marcos'
ghost wandering through the grounds ``searching for her son whom
she cannot find by her side.''
   Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in a civilian-military uprising
that ousted Marcos in February 1986. She has survived several coup
attempts since then and says his return would jeopardize the
national security.

<HEAD>Boston Children Hospitalized Twice as Often as Rochester Youngsters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poor children are more likely than wealthier
children to be hospitalized when they are sick, and hospitalization
rates vary dramatically between cities, a study has found.
   In their review of three cities, researchers found Boston
youngsters were about 2{ times more likely than children in
Rochester, N.Y., to be admitted to hospitals, while those in New
Haven, Conn., fell between the two.
   Despite Boston's higher rate, however, it was still below the
national average.
   ``If the general quality of care is no worse in Rochester than
elsewhere, other cities may be able to lower their number of
hospital beds and the cost of in-patient health care of chidren,''
the doctors wrote.
   The researchers noted that poor children are more likely than
wealthier youngsters to be put in the hospital when they get sick,
which may help explain the differences in hospitalization rates
among the cities.
   The study speculated that Boston's hospitalization rates were
higher than Rochester's because the city is poorer. They said poor
youngsters may have more severe illness and less access to
outpatient care. Doctors may also be more likely to admit them
because of concern about the chidren's home care.
   Earlier research has shown regional differences in hospital
admissions for adults.
   The study was conducted by Dr. James M. Perrin of Massachusetts
General Hospital with colleagues from Children's Hospital in Boston
and Dartmouth Medical School. It was published Wednesday in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   The study was based on 1982 data, and the researchers said they
assumed that hospitalization rates have fallen since then.
   Boston hospitalization rates for upper respiratory infections,
ear aches, croup and poisoning were more than five times higher
than in Rochester. However, hospitalization for surgery was similar
in the three cities.
   The researchers noted that if Boston children had been
hospitalized at the same rate as those in Rochester, only 1,858 of
the city's 4,927 medical admissions in 1982 would have occurred.
   The three cities were chosen for the study because they all have
hospitals affiliated with medical schools.

   Police blocked an anti-government
rally today and arrested 433 people after authorities, stung by the
deaths of six riot police, warned they would take emergency
measures to halt violent protests.
   About 8,000 riot police blanketed the downtown area in a major
show of strength to block a demonstration called by striking
workers and dissidents to denounce the government of President Roh
Tae-woo.
   Squads of police in green fatigues, visored helmets and armed
with shields and nightsticks patrolled the streets, dispersing
onlookers and keeping the area clear. Police vehicles roamed the
streets, and squads of troopers were at every major intersection.
   Officials said 433 students and workers were arrested after
being detained during street checks. Roadblocks turned back about
800 people trying to reach the rally site.
   About 50 radical students yelling anti-government slogans staged
a brief protest in the city center but fled as soon as riot police
arrived.
   ``They talk big, but they don't dare come out,'' said a grinning
officer.
   Dissident leaders said they expected up to 50,000 people would
participate in the rally in this industrial port city 120 miles
southeast of Seoul.
   But the enormous display of police strength frightened workers,
and no one was prepared to come onto the streets, they said. ``How
can we march for our rights when there are so many police?'' said
one protest leader.
   Workers unable to march because of the police presence staged
sit-down protests at factories. The sit-ins were peaceful, and
witnesses said there were no confrontations with police.
   In Seoul, a 24-year-old union leader at a garment factory doused
himself with kerosene and set himself on fire today to protest poor
working conditions, news reports said. He was hospitalized in
critical condition along with a second worker whose clothes
accidently caught fire.
   The radicals are calling for the overthrow of the Roh
government, but they have little public support because of their
violent tactics and extreme views. However, the government is
concerned about their efforts to build an anti-government alliance
with striking workers.
   Many riot troopers in Masan wore black ribbons of mourning for
their six comrades who were killed Wednesday in the nearby city of
Pusan during an attempt to free five police officers held hostage
by radical college students.
   The hostages were freed later.
   Roh warned he would invoke emergency powers to halt violent
anti-government protests and strikes that have hit South Korea in
recent months.
   The police deaths shocked South Koreans and brought calls from
both government and opposition leaders for an end to violent
protests. It was the worst loss of life related to political
violence since a 1980 anti-government uprising in Kwangju left at
least 192 people dead.
   Police said today that they would charge five student leaders
with murder and arson, charges which could be punishable by death.
Police said lesser charges would be filed against 40 other students.
   Also today, the governing and opposition parties agreed to enact
a law against firebombs.
   In Seoul, hundreds of radical students shouting ``Down with the
Roh regime'' marched on at least three campuses. But the students
avoided clashes with riot police stationed outside, apparently
sensing public anger at the killing of police officers in Pusan.
   ``We will go ahead with our anti-Roh campaign, but this time we
think we have to restrain ourselves,'' a student leader said.
   Government leaders say strikes have already cost the economy
more than $3 billion in lost production this year.
   Roh, a former general, won presidential elections in December
1987, after rival opposition leaders split the opposition vote. He
has helped introduce broad democratic reforms, but the radicals
claim the government is a front for military rule and assert there
have been no reforms.
   Also today, about 500 farmers and students staged a peaceful
protest march in downtown Chonan, 40 miles south of Seoul, to
protest U.S. agricultural imports, according to Yonhap, the South
Korean news agency.
   Another 700 students shouting ``Drive out Yankees!'' battled
riot police with firebombs and rocks in the central city of Taejon
to oppose the reported move of U.S. bases from Seoul to Taejon.
   The South Korean Defense Ministry announced Tuesday the United
States has agreed to relocate U.S. barracks in Seoul by the
mid-1990s. News reports said they would be moved to areas around
Taejon.
   Radical students have demanded withdrawal of the 43,000 American
troops stationed in South Korea, contending the soldiers hamper
unification with communist North Korea.

   The older Americans get, the happier they
are, according to a poll that found old age is the cure for
loneliness, money worries, and fear of disease and death.
   Nearly two-thirds of Americans age 65 or older are pleased with
their lives, compared to half the people ages 18 to 49, according
to a nationwide Los Angeles Times poll published Thursday.
   Fewer older people say they are lonely, nearly three times as
many old people as young say they are never depressed, and only 7
percent of the elderly say they have contemplated suicide, compared
to 20 percent of younger people, the poll found.
   Older people also worry less about money, with only about a
quarter of those over 65 reporting they worried about money in the
last 12 months, compared to almost half the people under 50 having
the same concern.
   And the closer people get to the end of their lives, the less
fearful they are of death. Ninety percent of people over 65 said
they are not afraid to die, compared to 80 percent of middle age
people and 75 percent of young people.
   The Times Poll interviewed 3,050 adult Americans by telephone
between April 1 and April 6. The poll's margin of error was
estimated at plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Vietnam Minister Admits Mistake in Not Condemning Khmer Rouge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Vietnamese official said in an
interview published today that Vietnam should have immediately
condemned the communist Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians in 1975-1978.
   But Vietnam corrected that mistake by invading Cambodia in late
1978 and ousting the Khmer Rouge government, Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach said in an interview published in the Bangkok Post.
   He spoke Wednesday in Bangkok before returning to Hanoi.
   Vietnam's communists helped form the Cambodian Communist Party.
They gave crucial military aid and direction to the Khmer Rouge,
whose insurgents won a five-year civil war and overthrew the
U.S.-backed Lon Nol government in April 1975.
   Over the next three years and eight months, the Khmer Rouge
killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and
slave labor camps in its attempt to fashion an agrarian society
along communist lines.
   Vietnam did nothing until 1978, when it invaded Cambodia
following border attacks in which the Khmer Rouge killed thousands
of Vietnamese villagers.
   After Thach condemned the crimes of the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol
Pot, the interviewer said: ``But the Vietnamese did not condemn Pol
Pot before.''
   ``Yes, it is our mistake,'' Thach replied. ``But we have
corrected our mistake by military means.''
   ``And now, what is the position of the Western countries?'' he
continued. ``They condemn them only by words, not by deeds. And
when we condemn them by force, they condemn Vietnam, so it is a
pity.''
   Some Asian and Western nations say the Khmer Rouge must be part
of a future coalition government because it might otherwise try to
take power by military means. Some reports have said the guerrillas
have stocked up arms for an all-out offensive after Vietnam
completes its promised troop withdrawal in September.
   Hun Sen, premier of the Vietnamese-installed government in
Cambodia, tried to rule out any future role for the Khmer Rouge at
this week's talks in Indonesia with resistance leaders Prince
Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann.
   The two non-communist leaders are allied with the Khmer Rouge in
the resistance coalition. They say they hate the Khmer Rouge but
need its 30,000 to 40,000 guerrillas.
   Thach welcomed the results of the talks in Indonesia.
   ``Now is is clear they have made some progress, to have
appropriate reconciliation, formula and mechanism on the basis of
the reality in Kampuchea (Cambodia),'' Thach said. ``I think it is
a good direction.''

   The flood of Central American refugees trying
to cross the U.S. border into Texas has slowed significantly thanks
to help from Mexico, federal immigration authorities say.
   Border security has been tightened in south Texas by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS officials say. In
addition, Mexican authorities have arrested 13,000 Central American
refugees in the last six months, up from 12,000 the prevous year,
the INS says.
   James L. Buck, deputy immigration commissioner, told reporters
Wednesday that Mexico has reinstituted checkpoints along that
country's southern border and authorities are randomly stopping
motorists to spot illegal aliens.
   Buck noted that the number of border arrests of illegal aliens
in south Texas has dropped from 200 to 300 a day to about 50 daily
since a 400-member INS task force was assigned to Port Isabel,
Texas, on Feb. 21.
   The task force was set up to help stop the explosion of
political asylum applications from Central Americans at the border.
Between June and December of last year the INS was receiving an
average of 5,000 asylum applications a month.
   Most of the refugees were not eligible for political asylum
because they couldn't satisfy the INS requirement that they
demonstrate a well-based fear of persecution.
   As many as 2,500 were detained at the Port Isabel facility,
which now holds 1,500 aliens awaiting adjudication of their asylum
claims. Another 1,700 have been deported, INS officials say.
   The number of asylum applications submitted at the border has
also dropped from 200 daily to only a handful, Buck said.
   If current trends continue, ``probably by the end of the summer,
we will begin to see this entire task force sized down
significantly,'' Buck said.
   INS Commissioner Alan Nelson said INS has received Justice
Department clearance to begin deportation of 100 Nicaraguans who
were denied political asylum.
   Under an attorney general's order, Nicaraguan refugees whose
asylum applications are rejected at INS are screened by a Justice
Department unit before deportation proceedings are instituted.
   Nelson said about 16 percent of Nicaraguans seeking asylum have
received it, compared to 4 percent from El Salvador.
   Nelson, meanwhile, credited the employer sanction provisions of
the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act with helping to reduce
the overall number of arrests along the 1,000-mile U.S.-Mexican
border.
   The INS has assessed $7 million in fines to employers accused of
hiring illegal aliens and collected $1.6 million, Nelson said.
   Nelson noted INS and Border Patrol agents arrested 1.6 million
illegal aliens in 1986, the year before the immigration law was
enacted. Since then the yearly totals have declined significantly,
he said.
   In the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year, arrests were
down about a third from 1988, when the total for 12 months was
940,670, Nelson said.
   The trend ``continues to demonstrate that the law is working,''
Nelson said.
   Under the one-year amnesty program for once-illegal aliens, the
INS is gearing up to process nearly 3.1 million requests from
foreigners to become permanent U.S. residents.
   The application deadline for amnesty was a year ago today. Since
then the INS has approved nearly 1.8 million applications for
temporary residency, while denying about 70,000.
   It continues to process the balance of the applications for
temporary residence.
   Aliens may apply for permanent residency 18 months after being
given legal status. They must apply for permanent residency within
a year of becoming eligible for face deportation.
   Advocacy groups contend the INS isn't doing enough to spread the
word about the impending deadlines.
   But INS officials say 60 percent of those who are now eligible
to apply have done so and they expect the application rate to reach
97 percent by the time the program ends.
   Nelson said the agency has received 290,000 applications so far.
   INS officials say computerized mailings make advertising
campaigns unnecessary because ``we are reaching out directly to
these people,'' said Richard Norton, associate commissioner for
examinations.

<HEAD>Toddler Falls 9 Stories, Saved By Juniper Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2-year-old girl fell nine stories from an open
window, but landed in a springy juniper bush and survived.
   ``I have owies,'' says Heather Ruebush. She was listed in good
condition today at University Hospital, where she was treated for a
lacerated liver, two broken ribs and scratches.
   ``She's a miracle baby, definitely,'' said her mother, Katrina
Tellus. ``They're calling her the bouncing miracle baby around the
hospital.''
   Heather was moved from intensive care to a regular ward
Wednesday and was expected to stay for observation through the
weekend.
   Heather, her mother and a friend had returned home from shopping
Monday and Tellus began preparing dinner.
   She said she was unaware that a living room window was open, its
sill about a foot above the floor.
   ``I turned around, and she wasn't there. It happened that
quick,'' said Tellus, 22. ``I was just praying to God she didn't go
through that window. When I saw that open window, it was complete
fright.
   ``She either sat on the window still and leaned back, or she
dropped her bottle and went after it. I've asked her, but she
doesn't know what happened.''
   Tellus said she ran to the window and looked down to where
Heather had landed in a 3-foot-tall juniper bush.
   ``She was down there, sitting up,'' Tellus said. ``She stayed
conscious all the time.''
   ``She said `Mama,''' Tellus said. ``She was kind of fading in
and out. She was just whimpering.''

<TEXT>
   An opposition politician claimed
today the government has secretly agreed to allow six U.S. military
bases to remain open in the Philippines after their leases expire
in 1991.
   President Corazon Aquino, faced with mounting opposition to U.S.
military presence, has refused to say whether she supports
extending the 1947 treaty.
   But Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile called Mrs. Aquino's avowed policy to
keep her options open a ``face-saving act.''
   ``There is no open option,'' Enrile said in an interview with
DZXL radio. ``There is already an extension of the bases agreement.
What they are discussing now is how much'' the United States will
pay.
   Last year, the United States agreed to pay the Philippines $962
million in aid to extend the treaty for two years.
   In an interview today, Mrs. Aquino said her government will
decide by September 1990 on whether to maintain the Clark Air Base,
Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller facilities in the
Philippines. She said talks on the issue with U.S. officials will
begin by year's end.
   Resentment has spread toward the 40,000 U.S. soldiers and their
dependents in the country. The Communist National Democratic Front
rebel army has offered to declare a unilateral cease-fire in its
20-year-old rebellion against the government if Mrs. Aquino
promises to close the bases.

   Country music star Johnny Cash is being treated at
the American Hospital of Paris for a pulled ligament in his right
knee, the hospital said today.
   Cash, 57, was admitted after his show Wednesday night at the
Zenith auditorium in Paris, a hospital statement said.
   Reba Hancock, his sister and spokeswoman, said the injury
apparently is minor. ``He's fine,'' she said in Nashville, Tenn.
   Cash, his wife, June Carter Cash, and an entourage left the
United States about 10 days ago and are expected to return May 17,
Ms. Hancock said.
   The injury was unrelated to Cash's heart problems, she said.
   Cash underwent double bypass heart surgery in December at
Nashville's Baptist Hospital and was released after a few weeks.
   Cash, a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, is know for
hits such as ``I Walk the Line,'' ``Folsom Prison Blues'' and
``Ring of Fire.''

<HEAD>21 Striking Miners Arrested in Second Week of Civil Disobedience</HEAD>

<DATELINE>McCLURE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State police arrested 21 striking miners
today for blocking the entrance to a mine run by the Pittston Coal
Group Inc.
   Members of the United Mine Workers union were continuing civil
disobedience tactics to keep pressure on the mining company as
mediated talks get started.
   The arrested miners were escorted into a state-owned bus and
taken to the Dickenson County jail. Strike organizers said they
expected the miners, who worked at McClure, to remain in jail
overnight.
   Students from nearby Ervington High School planned to
demonstrate at the jail tonight, said strike coordinator Marty
Hudson.
   UMW District President Jackie Stump told the miners as they were
being put on the bus, ``Remember now, go peaceably; no violence.''
   The strike, which began April 5, affects about 1,500 miners in
Virginia and West Virginia. Two hundred other union miners working
at Pittston operations in Kentucky have not yet left their jobs.
   Last week, more than 1,000 demonstrators were arrested by state
police outside Pittston operations in southwest Virginia. For the
most part, the demonstrations were non-violent and those arrested
were charged with misdemeanor trespassing. On Tuesday, several
miners and two contract drivers for the company were injured in a
rock-throwing melee that ended with a vehicle striking several
demonstrators.
   Meantime, representatives of the UMW and Pittston said they were
cautiously optimistic that federal mediation will break the
20-month deadlock in contract negotiations.
   ``I think it's a positive move in the right direction,''
Pittston President Michael Odom said Wednesday.
   A mediator with the U.S. Labor Department's Mediation and
Conciliation Service discussed the ground rules and agenda with
union and company officials Wednesday. The sides, however, have not
agreed on a date for the start of mediation or who the principal
negotiators will be.

   An IRA bomb exploded near a
road today, killing one soldier and injuring two civilians, police
said. In a second attack, a prison nurse died when a bomb exploded
under his car.
   The roadside bomb exploded as soldiers passed by on a foot
patrol in the village of Silverbridge, near the South Armagh border
of the province, a local police spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. Three soldiers in the patrol were in shock after the
bombing, the spokesman said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility. The IRA said
in a statement that the bombing was intented to coincide with the
celebration today of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10th
anniversary in power.
   ``We remind the British people on this, the 10th anniversary of
Mrs. Thatcher's government, that the Irish question remains
unresolved and cannot be resolved by military policies,'' said the
statement.
   ``If Mrs. Thatcher continues to pursue military goals, the IRA
will have no alternative but to continue to bring the British
occupation of Ireland to the attention of the British public.''
   The IRA is fighting to oust the British from the province and
often targets British security forces.
   The prison nurse, who was not identified, was married and had
two children, said a spokesman in Belfast for the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the province police force.
   He had driven a short way from his home near Loughgall, County
Armagh, en route to his job at Maze Prison in Belfast, said the
spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with British custom.
   He said no one claimed responsibility in the bombing.
   On Wednesday night, a third bomb exploded at an army observation
post on the South Armagh border, injuring three people, police said.
   Police said one civilian was treated for minor injuries and two
were treated for shock, but there were no security force casualties
from the bomb, which was believed to have been planted by the IRA.
   A man was arrested close to the scene moments after a tractor
parked in a field close to the scene exploded, said police.
   In Moy, in County Tyrone, army experts were searching for a
1,000-pound bomb the IRA claimed it had planted near Charlmount
Bridge.

   A former prison guard who suffocated an
8-year-old girl and left her body in a plastic bag was executed
today in Florida's electric chair for the youngster's death 11
years ago.
   Attorneys for 31-year-old Aubrey Adams Jr. had conducted a
whirlwind round of unsuccessful appeals Wednesday in hopes of
finding a judge to block the execution at Florida State Prison near
Starke.
   The victim's mother joined 15 relatives and family friends in a
pasture outside the prison before the execution.
   ``It's a decade too late but we finally got justice today. I
just wish my husband was here today,'' said Ann Thornley of
Reliance, Tenn., whose husband James died late last year of heart
problems. ``This killed him.''
   Seven capital punishment opponents kept a silent vigil nearby.
   After he was strapped into the electric chair, Adams was asked
if he had a final statement before the black hood was pulled over
his head.
   ``My pastor will be making my last statement for me,'' he
replied in a strong, clear voice.
   His pastor, W.J. Barfield, left the prison without talking to
witnesses or reporters but was contacted later at his Church of God
in Newberry.
   Barfield said Adams left a handwritten final statement that
said, in part: ``I hope and pray that all the new and re-opened
wounds will be healed quickly after my passing. My death is the
Lord's will and I am now with my Lord and savior Jesus Christ in
heaven.''
   Adams' statement made no direct reference to his crime but said
he ``forgives all those have had anything against me.'' He said the
death penalty was against Christ's teaching.
   The electricity in the death chamber was turned on at 7:04 a.m.
and Adams was pronounced dead five minutes later.
   Adams was the second person executed in Florida this year, and
the 21st in the state and 108th in the nation since the U.S.
Supreme Court's 1976 ruling that restored capital punishment.
   In January, confessed serial killer Ted Bundy was executed for
the slaying of Kimberly Diane Leach, a Lake City schoolgirl.
   The court late Wednesday voted 7-2 against an emergency request
for a delay, and turned down a formal appeal for a review of the
death sentence.
   Adams was under his fourth death warrant for the Jan. 23, 1978,
death of Trisa Gail Thornley, a third-grader last seen on her way
home from school in Ocala in central Florida.
   Her mutilated and naked body was found in a plastic bag about
two months later by hunters in a remote area three miles from her
home.
   An obscene phone call to the girl's home was traced to Adams'
home, and he eventually admitted picking her up. He later said he
recalled she screamed and he placed his hand over her mouth to
silence her, but not killing her. An autopsy showed she suffocated.
   Adams was a state prison guard at Marion Correctional
Institution from early 1977 until his arrest in March 1978.
   Adams had been under one death warrant in 1984 and two in 1986
after psychiatrists ruled him mentally competent to be executed.
State law requires that inmates be able to understand why they are
being punished before they can be executed.
   His mother, Marjorie Adams, of Trenton, Fla., wrote a letter to
then-Gov. Bob Graham in 1979 appealing for clemency.
   ``You as a parent must know what dreams you have for your child.
Mine are shattered. I once thought as a lot of others think that
the death penalty was the right thing. I only hope and pray that no
one has to have their thinking changed as I have. I love my son no
matter what happens and would gladly die that he may live,'' she
wrote.

<HEAD>Congress Finishing 1990 Budget, but Tax Problems Loom</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 4 grafs new with debates resumed, House approving veterans
amendment; picks up 4th graf pvs, A partisan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House and Senate worked today to finish
similar $1.2 trillion federal budgets for next year, but the
chairman of the House's tax-writing committee says Republicans
might delay necessary revenue-raising measures.
   The House by voice vote approved an amendment adding $175
million to its budget's veterans health care allocation, which was
already above President Bush's recommendation.
   Both chambers planned votes on several amendments through the
day. But they expected to finish action tonight without
dramatically altering the fiscal 1990 spending blueprint.
   The budgets reflect a pact reached last month between Bush and
congressional leaders, which promises to shrink next year's deficit
to just above $99 billion, in part by collecting an additional $5.3
billion in taxes.
   A partisan showdown looms over the composition of those taxes.
   Bush claims $4.8 billion of that can be raised by actually
cutting a tax. He says slashing capital gains taxes would cause the
economy to grow, with tax revenues growing proportionately.
   Democrats _ including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois _ have called the idea a money-loser
that would do little more than help the rich. They want to raise
the funds in unspecified other ways.
   Speaking on the House floor, Rostenkowski said that Democrats on
his panel would not seek any new revenues unless Republicans went
along. With Bush's ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge, Democrats are
leery of being depicted as the party that favors higher taxes.
   ``I will not encourage or support a revenue increase that does
not have the support of the president and a majority of members of
both sides of the aisle on my committee,'' he said.
   Rostenkowski told a reporter he expected Bush to cajole
Republican lawmakers, if necessary, to support any tax deal reached
between the administration and congressional Democrats.
   ``It's the president's budget,'' Rostenkowski said. ``The
president is going to have to do it.''
   Rostenkowski's Senate counterpart, Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told his colleagues that his panel
may propose tax increases surpassing $5.3 billion because it might
also approve some costly tax breaks.
   Those tax breaks, which cost the government revenues, might
include the research-and-development tax credit and a cut in the
surtax for catastrophic health care insurance, Bensten said. He did
not say which tax increases he favors.
   On Wednesday, the Senate picked its way through a series of
amendments, approving one adding $94 million for AIDS research and
another shifting $100 million to law enforcement from other
domestic agency budgets. It also went on record against gas tax
increases, approving by voice vote a non-binding provision that the
current 9-cent-per-gallon levy be left alone.
   In a 64-31 vote that illustrated the support they have for their
spending plan, the chamber's leaders also defeated an effort by
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., to transfer $3 billion from defense to
education programs.
   ``We made an agreement, and I believe it is a responsible and
fair agreement,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine.
   In the House, legislators spent their day arguing the merits of
their $1.17 trillion plan, with many members arguing that it was
the best that could be achieved considering Bush's reluctance to
raise taxes and Democrats' aversion to domestic spending cuts.
   ``We're left with having to work around the edges, which we
did,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   In an effort to reduce this year's expected $163 billion
shortfall, both chambers are relying heavily on rosy economic
projections, bookkeeping gimmicks such as shifting spending out of
fiscal 1990, and one-shot steps like selling federal assets.
   They would allow $299.2 billion in defense spending next year,
$2.5 billion more than this year. Expenditures for foreign aid
would reach $17 billion, and $14.2 billion would be raised from
taxes, higher user fees, and asset sales.
   Expected growth in programs that provide automatic benefits to
recipients, such as federal pensions, would be cut by $8.3 billion.
Among those savings would be $2.3 billion from Medicare, although
lawmakers say they expect the cuts to come from payments to doctors
and hospitals, not from beneficiaries.
   The greatest difference between the Senate and House is in how
they distribute money among most domestic programs. The House
favored education, health and veterans programs, while the Senate
placed more emphasis on agriculture, energy and law enforcement.

<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man is being investigated in the
alleged assaults of as many as 17 prostitutes in an area where nine
women have been found dead along the highways since last summer, a
court document says.
   State police filed an affidavit in New Bedford District Court
last month to obtain a warrant to search the man's house and truck.
The affidavit said police had interviewed 12 women, described as
prostitutes, who identified the man from photographs. Five other
women also were believed to have been assaulted.
   Three of the women said the man choked them, and two said they
were choked into unconsciousness, according to the affidavit
reported Wednesday by WJAR-TV in Providence, R.I., and today by the
Boston Herald and The Boston Globe.
   One woman said she saw a cord or rope in the man's vehicle and
thought the man was going to choke her with it, according to the
affidavit.
   The bodies of nine women have been found since July along
highways in the New Bedford area. Three were strangled, according
to death certificates. The cause of death was not determined for
the other six women.
   Authorities believe the women were killed by the same person or
persons, and all nine had ties to the drug community in New
Bedford. Some had turned to prostitution.
   Two New Bedford women missing since last summer are also feared
to be victims.
   The 26-year-old Freetown man whose home and truck were searched
April 19, one day after the affidavit was filed for the search
warrant, has not been charged in either the deaths or the assaults.
   State police said the search found bloodstains on the dashboard
and seat in the truck and that hair, fibers, clothes and four
knives were seized, the papers and television station reported.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina has refused to
identify any suspects in the investigation into the killings.
   But Tuesday, after testifying before the grand jury
investigating the killings, Margaret Medeiros, 22, a self-described
prostitute, told reporters that police had told her the man was a
suspect.
   She also said the man had tried to ``break my neck'' and told
her, ```I'm going to do to you what I did to them other bitches.'''
   The affidavit used to obtain the search warrant reportedly was
based on interviews conducted last month by state troopers and New
Bedford detectives investigating the deaths of the nine women, but
the affidavit did not mention the killings.
   The man whose home and truck were searched has told the Boston
Herald he had nothing to do with the assaults and was being linked
unfairly to the killings.
   ``If it was me, I wouldn't be talking to you right now,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Few Turn Out For Second Attempt To Launch Atlantis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TITUSVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roads leading to the launch pad where
the shuttle Atlantis waited for its second attempt at liftoff were
relatively empty of spectators today, and officials called it the
lowest turnout of recent years.
   ``There's nobody here,'' said Jerry Eads, assistant chief of
police in Titusville, which is just across the Indian River from
the space center. He estimated 1,000 people were in place five
hours before the scheduled launch of 1:48 p.m. Some of them had
been waiting since Wednesday night.
   Eads said he expected no more than 20,000 or 30,000 in his city
by launch time today, which would be the smallest crowd in recent
years.
   At the Kennedy Space Center itself, 8,000 to 10,000 people were
expected, according to Mitch Varnes, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics Space Administration.
   Last Friday, when NASA stopped the countdown 31 seconds before
launch, the center was filled to capacity with 15,000 people.
   ``Each day we have a scrub we usually lose 50 percent of our
attendance,'' Varnes said.
   An estimated 250,000 well-wishers turned out for the launch of
Discovery in September, the first shuttle mission since the
Challenger explosion in January 1986.

   A U.S. military helicopter making a night
training flight clipped a high-tension power line and crashed in
southern France, killing five Marines, officials said today.
   The UH-1 Huey, from the amphibious assault ship Guadalcanal
currently in port in Toulon, exploded when it hit a hillside at
about 9:45 p.m. Wednesday near Rougon, a village 500 miles
southeast of Paris.
   A local resident saw the explosion and called firefighters.
   Local police said all five men aboard were killed.
   In Washington, the Marine Corps said the Huey was one of two
conducting a navigation training exercise and that the lead
helicopter crashed. The other aircraft was not involved in the
accident, the corps said.
   The corps said the pilots were using night-vision goggles but
that there was no reason to suspect the goggles played a role in
the accident.
   However, a marine official in Washington said on condition of
anonymity that the goggles do not permit pilots to see power lines.
The Army recently ordered a safety inspection of its night-vision
goggles after several crashes.
   The helicopters involved in the exercise were assigned to Marine
Medium Helicopter Squadron 162 based at the New River, N.C., Marine
Corps Air Station.
   The names of the victims were to be released in Washington once
their relatives have been notified, the corps said.
   The helicopter was one of 13 taking part in France-U.S. training
exercises in southern France from April 29 to May 19, said Peter
Antico, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Paris. The exercises
also involve 1,200 troops operating from the Canjuers military base.

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international conference today
agreed to safeguard company secrets on production of chemicals that
harm the ozone layer, despite objections from environmentalist
groups.
   The corporate secrecy issue caused fiery debate at the
U.N.-sponsored meeting reviewing the 1987 Montreal Protocol.
   The Montreal agreement, ratified by 36 countries, pledges
drastic cuts in the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, which are blamed for breaking down the ozone layer.
   The secrecy resolution, put forward by the United States and the
12 nations of the European Economic Community, won unanimous
approval, delegates said.
   Greenpeace delegate Karen Coulter said the environmental group
feared that greater secrecy could help countries hide the
production of banned chemicals. Under the Montreal Protocol, the
signatory nations must report to the U.N. Environmental Program on
the production, consumption and trade in five chlorofluorocarbons
and three halon gases.
   Greenpeace wanted public disclosure of these reports.
   But industrial countries were insisting on more discretion in
deciding what figures should be made public, Ms. Coulter said. Some
Western countries said full disclosure, which could give one
company information about another's production, could be against
the law.
   ``Canada, like the United States, has national legislation
protecting commercial confidentiality. If the companies give us
data, we can't release it,'' said A. Chisholm, head of Canada's
Atmospheric Research Directorate.
   ``We asked the meeting, `How is it that commercial
confidentiality can override environmental concern?''' said Ms.
Coulter.
   Delegates from 86 countries and nearly 100 non-governmental
organizations are attending the conference, which is to update the
1987 document requiring signatories to halve by 1999 their
production of five chlorofluorocarbons and three halons. The
chemicals break down the earth's protective ozone shield,
increasing the risk of skin cancers and eye disease.
   It was the second contentious issue reported from the
closed-door meeting. On Wednesday, the countries split over how to
help Third World countries pay for technology to replace the
equipment that emits harmful chemicals.
   The United States, Canada, Britain, Japan and other nations that
would be the largest donors opposed a recommendation to set up a
special fund.
   U.S. delegate Stephen Seidel of the Environment Protection
Agency said the fund could cost so much in administration that it
would siphon off money better spent in bilateral aid projects. A
draft resolution was submitted today that would delay the question
at least until next year.

   A federal judge today refused to prohibit
the Lac du Flambeau band of Chippewa Indians from spearing all of
its allowable fish catch on some northern Wisconsin lakes.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb said she would hear further
arguments from the state on the issue. And she said she would hear
arguments Friday on Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's request that she stop
all Chippewa Indian spearfishing by Saturday.
   An agreement to cut the fish take was reached at a meeting more
than two weeks ago between Thompson and leaders of the six Chippewa
bands. But after increasing harassment of spearfishing Indians by
sport fishermen, the tribal chief said Tuesday that the band might
begin taking 100 percent of the fish that biologists consider safe
to take from a lake.
   The Thursday hearing was a telephone conference hookup among the
state attorney general, the judge and a lawyer representing the
Indians.
   Assistant State Attorney General Stephen Nicks told the judge
the prohibition order on Lac du Flambeau spearing was necessary to
protect the fish. He said if the band carried out its threat to
increase the take of walleye, it would complicate state efforts to
set limits for the hook-and-line season for the general public
opening Saturday.
   Crabb said the Chippewa appeared to be ``giving up something to
which they were already entitled'' in the agreement with Thompson.
She said she wondered why the Lac du Flambeau would want to ``step
aside'' from a right they have had for more than 100 years under
19th century treaties.
   Tribal chairman Michael G. Allen Sr. warned the state Tuesday
that the band could retaliate against future violent
anti-spearfishing protests by taking 100 percent of the safe catch
from any lakes where incidents take place.
   Nine arrests were reported Wednesday night, including two at Big
Arbor Vitae Lake where about 300 people gathered on land and about
30 boats congregated on the lake to protest the off-reservation
spearing.
   More than 100 arrests have been made since the spearing season
began April 23. This is the fifth year Wisconsin's six Chippewa
tribes have speared fish off reservation since a federal court
ruled the tribe retained the right to hunt, fish, trap and gather
wild grain under 19th century treaties that ceded land to the
United States.
   Unlike in previous springs, this year has no specific date for
the end of the season. The fish are most easily speared during
spring, when they spawn is shallow waters.

   A two-day strike at the University of
California at Berkeley is aiming for national recognition of a
burgeoning movement on the country's campuses to recognize graduate
assistants as employees.
   ``We do the majority of educating on most major campuses,'' said
Lawrence Coates, a 32-year-old classroom assistant who said he
barely survives on a university stipend.
   The average student assistant at Berkeley receives about $10,000
annually in living expenses for one of the most expensive regions
in the country.
   ``We're teaching the bulk of classes; we give out the grades;
students come to us with their problems. Is that a teacher or what?
But where's the respect for my work?'' Coates asked.
   Union representatives claimed hundreds of classes were canceled
for the two-day strike that was concluding today. University
officials called the protest largely symbolic, although they did
not check the number of canceled classes.
   At the start of the school day Wednesday, placard-carrying
demonstrators greeted students and university workers at major
entrances to campus, handing out yellow armbands and chanting,
``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Union busting's got to go!'' The campus
appeared unusually quiet.
   Elsewhere around the country, student protests continued over
various issues:
   _About 45 students occupying offices at the University of
Massachusetts in Amherst for the third time in two weeks refused to
leave today despite warnings that administrators were preparing to
remove them forcibly. They were protesting Pentagon-funded research.
   Some 75 students had spent the night in the research building,
but 30 left voluntarily this morning. The warning was issued in a
45-minute meeting the protesters had with the university's public
safety director, Arthur Hilson.
   _In New York City, some students promised amnesty ended their
sit-ins against proposed tuition increases, while City University
officials struggled with an $18 million budget deficit. But other
students held fast, saying they would occupy administration
buildings and offices as long as Gov. Mario Cuomo refuses to meet
for a face-to-face discussion. Cuomo vetoed the tuition hike
Tuesday.
   _In Ohio, about 50 students held a candlelight vigil early today
marking the 19th anniversary of the Kent State University
shootings. Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire on demonstrators
during an anti-war protest on May 4, 1970, killing four students
and wounding nine.
   _Several hundred students at Middlebury College in Vermont set
up pickets outside classrooms and administration buildings today to
protest a planned 11.7 percent fees increase for next year.
Tuition, room and board would be raised from $17,000 to $19,000.
Betsy Etchells, executive assistant to college President Olin
Robison, said the increase was set by trustees and would not be
changed.
   _In Atlanta, 40 to 50 Mercer University students, faculty and
alumni, hoping to pressure school trustees to keep their College of
Arts and Sciences open, ended a 24-hour ``read-in'' this morning
and immediately began a 24-hour prayer vigil.
   Last month, the trustees, faced with a multimillion-dollar
deficit, voted 31-5 to close the liberal arts college in June 1990.
The Atlanta campus would continue to house other university
functions, including a pharmacy school and a graduate business
school.
   The dispute at Berkeley and many other universities is whether
schools should continue to view classroom and laboratory assistants
as scholars on stipends or employees with a right to collective
bargaining.
   University of California teaching assistants handle 58 percent
of classroom work involving undergraduate students while research
assistants do about half the laboratory work, according to a study
by the Association for Graduate Student Employees.
   The Berkeley-based union of 3,200 graduate assistants,
affiliated with the United Auto Workers, is in the vanguard of
student-educators nationwide who say they are underpaid, overworked
and often forced to go without health and other benefits. The
assistants also would like to negotiate such issues as class size.
   Berkeley spokesman Tom Debley said the university believes the
work cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwined
with educational experience.
   During the last decade, major universities in at least five
states _ Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Oregon and New Jersey _ have
recognized graduate assistants as employees.
   The debate has cropped up at many more campuses and a victory at
Berkeley, one of the nation's most prestigious universities, could
legitimize graduate students' demands, said David Lambert, an
association executive board member.
   Teaching assistants at the University of Wisconsin in Madison
won collective bargaining rights from the Legislature in 1985. Now
represented by a union affiliated with the American Federation of
Teachers, they are negotiating their second contract.
   At the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the university and
its newly organized teaching assistants reached a collective
bargaining agreement earlier this year that gives assistants a 14
percent pay raise over the next two years.
   The University of Oregon in Eugene rejected graduate students'
efforts to unionize in 1975, but the state Employment Relations
Board ruled in the student's favor in December 1976 and a local was
formed the following year. They have negotiated two-year contracts
with the university since then.
   At the University of Massachusetts, the coordinating committee
of the teaching assistants union voted last week to affiliate with
the United Auto Workers.
   At Berkeley, the union has been seeking recognition since 1983.
In a 2-1 ruling last week, the state Public Employment Relations
Board said that a 1979 law forbids graduate students from being
treated as employees because their work duties are part of
scholarly training.
   The association plans to appeal the decision to a state
appellate court.
   Despite the labor board's ruling, legal precedent exists in
California for the students' demands. After losing a court battle
that reached the state Supreme Court, the University of California,
San Francisco recently decided to recognize the San Francisco
Interns and Residents Association as a bargaining unit for some
graduate students at its hospital.

   An Afghan warplane bombed a refugee
camp in Pakistan today, killing three Afghans and injuring 16,
officials said.
   The warplane was one of two that flew over the Gambila refugee
camp this morning, 70 miles east of the Afghanistan border,
officials in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province said on
condition of anonymity.
   One plane dropped a bomb that destroyed six houses and left a
crater 20-feet wide, the officials said. Seven of the injured were
in serious condition.
   Pakistan supports the Moslem guerrillas fighting the communist
government in Kabul and shelters more than 3 million refugees of
the 11-year Afghan civil war. Many of the guerrilla leaders are
based in Pakistan.
   Today's incursion by Afghan warplanes was the first reported
since last fall. The Foreign Ministry is expected to lodge a
protest with the Afghan government as it has after previous air
raids.
   On Wednesday, Afghanistan accused Pakistan of helping the
guerrillas prepare new attacks on the Afghan cities of Jalalabad
and Kandahar.
   The Moslem guerrillas have besieged Jalalabad since March 6,
about three weeks after Soviet forces ended nine years of
intervention in the war. Pakistan funnels mainly-U.S. arms to the
guerrillas. Kabul has warned the war may spill over into Pakistan
unless Islamabad stops helping the guerrillas.

   A grand jury considering whether to return a
murder charge against a man who unhooked the life-support system
from his comatose infant son heard testimony from the defendant's
wife and two other family members.
   Rudy Linares, 23, of suburban Cicero, is charged by police with
murdering his 16-month-old son, Samuel, on April 26 at a Chicago
hospital.
   Linares' wife, Tamara, his mother, Marie, and brother, Robert,
testified Wednesday.
   Linares was not called to testify.
   Authorities said Linares used a handgun to keep hospital
personnel from interferring as he unhooked the ventilator that kept
Samuel breathing.
   Defense attorneys have said Linares believed his son died nearly
nine months before when he swallowed a piece of a balloon, choked
and fell into an irreversible coma.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys refused to divulge what was
said at the closed hearing.
   If the grand jury chooses not to return an indictment, the case
probably would be referred to a Circuit Court judge, whose options
would include dropping the existing charge.

   A good-bride, bad-groom billboard
advertising a family counseling service is coming down after an
organization of divorced men called it a slap at males.
   The sign on the roof of a suburban Detroit office building
showed a beaming bride with a demonically transformed groom at her
shoulder.
   ``After marriage, people sometimes change,'' it read, and it
told where to get help for troubled marriages.
   Fathers for Equal Rights, a support group for divorced fathers,
called the portrayal of the groom a sexist smear.
   ``She's a beautiful spring bride, but he looks like Dracula, or
a demon with spiked hair, Friday the 13th eyes, flared nostrils and
bared teeth,'' said executive director Al Lebow.
   ``It's another example of male bashing ... which everyone seems
to accept. They wouldn't dare depict a woman like that,'' Lebow
said.
   He said if the sign weren't removed and replaced with an apology
his group would campaign to curtail contributions to United Way of
America, which supports the Oakland County group that put up the
sign.
   The sign will be removed, said Bill Fry, executive director of
Oakland Family Services. ``The intent of the billboard was to draw
attention to our organization, not to insult men.''
   He said the billboard space was donated, and his group doesn't
have money to post an apology.

<HEAD>Mothers of Twins Less Likely To Get Breast Cancer, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who give birth to twins reduce their
risk of contracting breast cancer, according to researchers.
   Although scientists have known for some time that giving birth
reduces a woman's risk of contracting breast cancer, a joint study
released today by the Albany Medical Center and Yale University
found that mothers of twins may get far greater protection against
breast cancer. Mothers of twins receive a double dose of
alpha-fetoprotein _ an estrogen-opposing protein manufactured by
the liver, according to the study.
   Estrogen is considered a major factor in the growth of 40
percent of breast cancers, according to researchers.
   The study found that women who gave birth to twins during their
last pregnancy had an incidence of breast cancer equal to that of
women who had given birth to six single children.
   The finding, appearing in the May issue of the American Journal
of Epidemiology, also showed that this extra-protective effect may
vanish if a mother of twins later gives birth to a single child.
   The results were gathered by reviewing the reproductive
histories of more than 9,000 women ages 20 to 55. About half of the
subjects had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer.

   President Bush observed National Day of Prayer
with a breakfast with religious leaders at the White House today,
and promptly noticed no one had offered to begin the meal with a
prayer.
   Bush also told the ecumenical gathering, ``I'm sure we would all
agree that we believe in separation of church and state, but not in
the separation of morality or moral values and state.''
   ``While the government must remain neutral towards particular
religions, it must not _ certainly it need not _ remain neutral
towards values that Americans support,'' the president said.
   One of the participants, the Rev. Billy Zeoli, president of
Gospel Films in Grand Rapids, Mich., said, ``I was fascinated by
Mr. Bush when the president noticed that, as we were sitting at
breakfast, no one began with a prayer.''
   Zeoli, who was White House chaplain during the Ford
administration, said Bush ``simply stood up'' and made the
observation, then picked one from the group, Senate Chaplain
Richard C. Halverson, to say a few words.
   Vonette Bright, chairwoman of the National Day of Prayer Task
Force, said she asked Bush privately ``what can we pray for?''
   She said he mentioned ``in private conversation'' the upcoming
conference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, deeply split
on the subject of short-range missiles, and also ``his great
concern for the moral values of our country, particularly to do
with drugs.''
   Bush noted that it was the first time that the National Day of
Prayer had a permanent date of designation _ the first Thursday of
every May.
   ``We welcome you, we are pleased you're and if you have an extra
minute for a prayer when the going gets a little tough, remember
the Congress. They need it, too,'' the president joked.
   Several members of Congress in attendance.

   James Brown spent his 56th birthday alone
in prison but Jesse Jackson paid a belated birthday visit to ``The
Godfather of Soul.''
   Jackson, who appeared before the state parole board on Brown's
behalf in March, declined to talk to reporters on his way into the
prison today.
   Brown's wife, Adrienne, was the only person who had received
permission to visit him on his birthday Wednesday and she didn't,
said Bennish Brown, a spokesman for the South Carolina Department
of Corrections.
   The spokesman said Jackson was given permission to visit Brown
today at the State Park Correctional Center, where the singer is
serving a six-year term. Brown will not be eligible for parole
until mid-1991.
   Brown is serving time for aggravated assault and failing to stop
for police during a chase across the Georgia-South Carolina border
on Sept. 26.

<TEXT>
   An explosion at Brazil's largest
steel plant injured five workers and seriously damaged the
company's largest blast furnace, a company official said today.
   The blast crippled 70 percent of production at the
government-run National Steel Company in Volta Redonda, 80 miles
west of Rio, said company spokesman Marciano Machado.
   He said it was not known what caused the blast at the plant,
which produces 4.6 million tons of steel a year, almost 20 percent
of Brazil's annual production. ``We believe it was caused by an
accumulation of gas in the blast furnace,'' Machado said.
   The plant, which employs 22,000 workers, has been the scene of
labor unrest in the past. Last year, three striking steelworkers
were killed when army troops stormed the plant occupied by more
than 1,000 laborers.
   On Tuesday, a monument honoring the three was destroyed by a
bomb. No group claimed responsibility in the attack on the statue,
designed by Brazil's best known architect, Oscar Niemeyer.
   It had been dedicated during May Day celebrations Monday.
   Machado said there was ``absolutely no connection'' between
Tuesday's bombing and Wednesday's explosion.
   The plant's other two blast furnaces were operating normally
today, and the company hoped to have repairs completed within ten
days, Machado said.
   The Volta Redonda plant exports 1.3 million tons of steel per
year.
   Machado said the damaged blast furnace produces 7,400 tons of
pig iron a day, 70 percent of the plant's total.

   One of two men who said they took
hostages in The Robesonian newspaper office to draw attention to
official corruption pleaded guilty today to fourteen counts of
second-degree kidnapping.
   Timothy Jacobs, 20, agreed to a plea bargain that called for him
to serve six years in prison followed by a six-year suspended
sentence with supervised probation.
   ``He wants to get on with his life and do something with
himself,'' said his mother, Eleanor Jacobs, after the court
appearance. ``It was his decision (to plea bargain). I didn't talk
him into anything.''
   Jacobs was whisked away by deputies after posting bond so that
he could sign out of the Cumberland County Jail. Asked what he
would do during the 30-day leave, he said, ``Enjoy myself. ... Sign
a movie contract.''
   His lawyer had asked for the time so that Jacobs could get
married and attend to other personal affairs. District Attorney
Richard Townsend criticized the arrangement, saying, ``I object to
him having a honeymoon.''
   Jacobs and Eddie Hatcher held up to 20 people hostage in the
newspaper's newsroom for 10 hours on Feb. 1, 1988. They said they
took over the newspaper to draw attention to allegations of
official corruption and drug trafficking in Robeson County.
   A state task force appointed by Gov. Jim Martin found no
evidence to support their allegations.
   Hatcher and Jacobs were acquitted last year by a federal jury in
Raleigh on hostage-taking charges. The state charges then were
filed by Robeson County authorities.
   Jacobs had sought refuge from the state charges by fleeing to an
Indian reservation in upstate New York. He was returned to North
Carolina in March after dropping an appeal of a New York
extradition order.
   Hatcher, 31, is being held in San Francisco in lieu of $1
million bail and an extradition hearing is scheduled for Friday.
Hatcher had sought refuge on a reservation in Idaho. He later asked
the Soviet consulate in San Francisco for political asylum but his
plea was rejected and he was arrested.

<HEAD>House GOP Leader Questions Reliquinshing Canal to Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich said today
that Americans would not tolerate turning over the Panama Canal to
an administrator handpicked by a dictator.
   Echoing Bush administration statements predicting fraud in
Sunday's Panamanian national elections, Gingrich said ``there's a
very grave danger _ I would say almost a probability _ that the
dictatorship plans to steal the election.''
   Gingrich said that during a White House meeting of Republican
leaders with Bush there was considerable discussion about ``the
concern that all of us feel'' about the possibility the elections
will be rigged to keep strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in
charge.
   Gingrich said a continuing dictatorship rule in Panama could
jeopardize consummation of the Panama Canal treaties, ratified by
the Senate in 1979. Gingrich stopped short, however, of calling for
the United States to abrogate the treaties.
   Under terms of the pacts, the United States is scheduled to
relinquish the strategic canal to Panama in 1999. The U.S.
government is scheduled this year, however, to approve a Panamanian
selected by that government to be the canal's administrator.
   Gingrich said that people committed to democracy in Central
America must ``figure out how the people of Panama can regain
control over their country and have fair and honest elections.''
   Bush said in a speech earlier this week that ``it is evident
that the regime is ready to resort to massive election fraud in
order to remain in power.''
   He said the United States ``will not recognize the results of a
fraudulent election engineered simply to keep Noriega in power.''
But the president didn't say what other steps he might take in the
wake of an election considered to be fraudulent.
   Gingrich, talking to reporters in the White House driveway, said
he favors ``making clear to the people of Panama that we very much
want to work to implement the treaty only with a duly-elected
government that's democratic and that's honest.''
   The U.S. aim, he said, should be to ``serve notice that a phony
election, stolen by a dictatorship, does not constitute the kind of
sovereign government that the United States had in mind in terms of
having treaty relations with Panama.''
   ``I think it is inconceivable that the American people would
tolerate allowing Noriega, either directly or through a puppet, to
appoint the administrator of the Panama Canal,'' Gingrich said. ``I
can't imagine that the American people would tolerate that. It's a
very real and very serious danger.''

<TEXT>
   Two islands off Scotland's west coast
are for sale, and only the rich need apply.
   The 3,400-acre island of Gigha is expected to fetch between $3.4
million and $5 million, according to the real estate agent, Savills.
   Offers for the 600-acre Holy Island are to begin at $1.6
million, said estate agent Knight, Frank and Rutley.
   Included in the Gigha sale are rhododendron and exotic shrub
gardens, planted in 1944 when Sir James Horlick acquired the island
to pursue his passion for the species.
   The island, with a population of 160, was bought in the 1970s by
the Landales, a prominent Scottish landowning family, which is
leaving ``for family reasons,'' the agent said.
   The 19th century Achamore House, its gardens, a hotel, 39 estate
cottages, six farms, and 1,250 acres of farmland are included.
   Holy Island, being sold by Edward and Catherine Morris because
of Morris' ill health, also is home to rare breeds of animals and
plants. On the island are 11 Eriskay ponies, 100 Soay sheep, wild
goats and a small herd of Highland cattle.
   There's a small farmhouse, two automatic lighthouses and four
cottages.
   During the late 17th century, a missionary of the Celtic Church,
St. Molio, lived on the island. His influence gave the site its
religious signifigance.

   South Korean navy ships on Thursday
foiled an apparent North Korean attempt to seize a South Korean
fishing boat near the western sea border, the Defense Ministry said.
   A North Korean naval craft tried to seize the 23-ton Samjin-ho
operating in the area, the ministry said.
   The North Korean ship retreated to the north when South Korean
navy ships chased it, the ministry said.
   North Korea has seized South Korean fishing boats near the
western sea border, but returned most of them.
   In January, two South Korean fishing boats with 22 crewmen on
board were seized in the area. The ships and all their crewmen were
returned two weeks later.
   According to government figures, North Korea has seized 295
South Korean fishing boats since 1945.
   North Korea's Korean Central News Agency accused South Korea of
sending a warship into North Korean waters off the west coast, but
said it fled south when a North Korean patrol boat arrived at the
scene.

   Taxis did a land-office business today and
private vehicles gave lifts to commuters after the government
refused to rescind its decision to fire 23,000 city bus workers who
went on strike.
   Hundreds of buses from the neighboring state of Mexico were
brought in to cover the most heavily used routes of the bus system,
which carries an estimated 2 million riders a day.
   Authorities said military vehicles might be pressed into service
if needed.
   Downtown streets appeared less congested than normal without the
big yellow buses belching black diesel fumes. But the state buses
were charging about 16 cents a ride, four times the regular fare.
   The government fired city bus drivers, mechanics and
administrative workers who staged a one-day walkout Wednesday over
demands for a 50 percent wage increase.
   The workers called off the walkout after they were fired, but
the government refused to rehire them and said it would move ahead
with plans to reorganize the bus line.
   The workers' action came after the government offered
concessions to public school teachers who have been striking for
nearly three weeks.
   The bus workers' salaries average more than $9,000 a year, the
highest in the country for employees of a municipal service.
   Teachers average $1,700 a year.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's office said concessions
granted to teachers would not be extended to other public employees
because teachers had been left behind in past years.
   The president's statement did not mention bus workers but said
widespread raises could revive severe inflation.
   Enrique Jackson, city transportation coordinator, told a news
conference the bus workers could apply for jobs in the new system.
He did not say if there would be spots for all of them.
   He said service under the reorganization should be back to
normal next week.
   City spokesman Jose Luis Manjarrez said that because the bus
strike was declared illegal in advance by the federal labor
mediation board, employees knew they faced dismissal.
   The board acted after the bus workers rejected a 14 percent
increase in wages and benefits.
   The government had increased its offer of an 18 percent raise in
teachers' wages and benefits to 25 percent. Talks on extending that
offer to non-teaching employees and on union democracy continued
Wednesday.
   The buses are part of a system that includes a subway, jitneys
and private bus lines in the city of 19 million. City buses charge
100 pesos, or about 4 cents, a ride.
   Extra police have been assigned to handle crowds at subway
stations and idle government vehicles mobilized to pick up riders
for free.
   A communique from Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis' office said that
under preliminary plans for the bus line reorganization, workers
are to become part owners and operate more independently.
   It appeared a fare increase might come with the reorganization.
Salinas has started a campaign to make state-owned companies
profitable or get rid of them.
   Alfonso Macin, a city spokesman, said the fare for the
reorganized system would be agreed upon ``without the union in the
middle.''

   Charges against Speaker Jim Wright will
probably go to trial before the House ethics committee late this
month and will take seven to 10 days to complete, the panel's
chairman said today.
   Unless there is agreement between the lawyers for Wright,
D-Texas, and the committee to do otherwise, the process will begin
with a presentation of witnesses and other evidence by the
committee's special outside counsel, Richard Phelan.
   Wright's lawyer would then have a chance to offer rebuttal
evidence and bring Wright to the stand for a personal defense.
   Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said he expected the
disciplinary hearing _ the trial-like proceeding at which the panel
decides whether the 69 ethics charges against Wright have been
proved _ to begin ``the latter part of this month.''
   Dixon told reporters the committee has not yet decided whether
to waive its rules against televising the hearing but added that he
thought ``we should adhere to the rules.'' Wright's supporters
believe television coverage would not be favorable to him and thus
oppose it.
   The ethics panel continued today to interview investors in a
Texas gas drilling venture that made a hefty profit for Wright last
year. Dixon said the interviews were progressing more slowly than
expected and could continue Friday.
   On Wednesday, the panel interviewed San Antonio businessman
Morris Jaffe and geologist Doug Prestridge, both involved in the
deal last year that turned $9,120 into $340,000 over a five-month
period for an investment partnership in which Wright, D-Texas, held
a 50 percent stake.
   Today, the panel began talking to Maryln Cherry, Jaffe's
bookkeeper. It also was scheduled to talk to Jaffe's son Doug, who
is president of the family enterprises, and to Dave Myers, who
supplied the drilling equipment for the well.
   ``There are still a lot of unresolved questions,'' Rep. John T.
Myers of Indiana, the committee's senior Republican, said during a
break in Wednesday's daylong, closed-door hearing.
   Myers said the continuing investigation was distracting
committee staff from the task of preparing for Wright's
disciplinary hearing.
   But Dixon defended his panel against Wright's criticism Tuesday
that the probe had become ``a moving target'' and impossible to
defend against.
   ``The record of the committee shows we have tried to rigidly
adhere to the rules,'' Dixon said. Wright ``will in an appropriate
time have a chance to respond to all the charges.''
   Dixon and other committee members declined to discuss details of
the closed-door testimony, but Stanley Brand, the Washington lawyer
for the investors, said it largely covered the same territory as a
23-page statement on the deal he issued earlier this week.
   That document justified the transaction as a legitimate business
venture and noted that the remaining partners in the deal plan to
drill another well, believing substantial gas deposits remain to be
tapped. It was not, Brand's statement contended, a gift to Wright
designed to gain favor and influence over legislation.
   The Jaffes have been competing to sell the Air Force a new
trainer aircraft produced by one of their companies, Jaffe
Aerospace.
   When it announced last week it was charging Wright with 69 House
rules violations, the ethics committee said it was continuing to
investigate the gas venture, known as the Sabine Lake project after
its location near the Louisiana-Texas line.
   As the ethics panel went about its work, a separate House task
force on ethics began looking at the changing ethical landscape in
Washington and began examining whether it is time after 12 years to
update House rules again.
   At the task force hearing, which opened Wednesday, chairman Vic
Fazio, D-Calif., sought to isolate the hearing from the current
Wright controversy. One witness made the case against revision:
former Rep. Otis Pike, D-N.Y., who opposed the last rewrite of the
rules in 1977.
   ``You were not sent here to peek through the windows of each
other's private lives,'' Pike said. ``You were sent here to pass
laws and solve problems. Your preoccupation with each other's
ethics is preventing you from doing your jobs.''
   He added: ``No one learns his ethics in Congress. No one needs
to be told by his colleagues what is right and fair and honorable.
... Ethics is not as great a problem with Congress as is courage.''

   Some say the police here have
chalked up a victory in the war on crime, others say they've erased
democracy by arresting two women who allegedly wiped away a meter
maid's tire marks.
   ``Nobody is in the middle,'' Police Chief Gary Johansen said
after misdemeanor charges were filed against Rosina Baur and Anne
Bisco. ``Either we are the Gestapo, or they say, `Right on, you did
exactly the right thing.'''
   What police say they did was handcuff and frisk the two women,
who were also arrested for investigation of interfering with a city
official.
   The two are scheduled to appear in court next month. If
convicted they could be fined up to $1,000 and jailed for up to six
months.
   Police in this seaside community have received about 50 letters
and calls since the April 21 arrests, Johansen said recently.
Opinions have been about equally divided, he said.
   The two said Officer Robert Connor took them to jail after
saying he was going to teach them a lesson. Police have advised
Connor not to comment.
   Ms. Bisco acknowledged she wiped a chalk mark off her car's
tire, adding she expects to settle the case by paying a fine.
   But Ms. Baur said she did no such thing. She said she simply
moved her car to a different space in a shopping center parking lot
when she saw the meter maid approaching. She said she will fight
the case in court.

   A hard-line nationalist today shot
and killed the leader of pro-independence forces in the French
Pacific territory of New Caledonia and one of his top aides,
officials said.
   The assailant was mortally wounded by bodyguards of Jean-Marie
Tjibaou, 53, president of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation
Front, officials said.
   High Commissioner Bernard Grasset, New Caledonia's top
administrator, said Tjibaou and his assistant, Yeiwene Yeiwene,
were shot by Djubelly Wea of the United Front for Kanak Liberation,
an extremist faction that considers Tjibaou too moderate.
   Grasset said Wea and two unidentifed accomplices were shot and
badly wounded by the bodyguards and that Wea later died. Grasset
said a criminal investigation was opened, and the wounded men will
be brought back to Noumea.
   Leaders of the assassin's group today announced they are
breaking from a nationalist coalition led by Tjibaou.
   The United Front wants independence at any cost, including
violent action, while Tjibaou, in a surprise move last year, agreed
to a French proposal that includes a referendum in 1998 to decide
whether the territory will become independent or remain part of
France.
   In Paris, the minister for overseas departments and territories,
Louis le Pensec, praised Tjibaou's courage. ``He placed a bet on
peace and reconciliation,'' le Pensec said in a statement. ``The
choice was not easy. He did not give in either for the present, or
for the future.''
   The assassinations occurred on the outlying island of Ouvea, the
scene last year of bloody clashes between nationalists and French
soldiers that left 25 people dead, including six soldiers.
   The nationalists were there to mark the May 5 anniversary of the
storming of a cave where nationalists were holding 22 paramilitary
policemen hostage to press their demands for independence.
   Four policemen were killed in the April 22 attack on a remote
station in which the hostages were taken. The May 5 assault left 19
Kanaks and two more policemen dead.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, have the fastest growing
population and make up 43 percent of the 145,000 inhabitants of
these islands 1,000 miles east of Australia. European settlers and
their descendants comprise 37 percent, and the rest are Polynesians
and Asians.

<HEAD>Zimbabwe Clears 15 Men Accused of Murdering Missionaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The High Court has freed 15 men
accused of massacring 11 white missionaries and five of their
children, saying they are absolved by a presidential amnesty,
newspapers reported today.
   Among those slain in November 1987 were American Pentecostal
missionaries David Emerson, 35, and his fiancee, Karen Ivesdal, 31,
who were from Choteau, Mont., and Briton Jean Campbell, 56.
   State prosecutor Thomas Bvekerwa said on Wednesday the 15 _
seven dissident guerrillas and eight squatters _ are protected by
an April 1988 amnesty declared by President Robert Mugabe, The
Chronicle reported.
   It said the men could have been hanged if they were convicted of
murder. The state had charged they hacked their victims to death
with axes at two farms near southern Bulawayo city on the night of
November 25, 1987. It was an act of revenge because police acting
on the missionaries' complaints had evicted the squatters,
prosecutors said.
   The squatters had been trying to reclaim the land, which they
said belonged to their ancestors long before white settlers arrived
a hundred years ago in this former British colony.
   Besides the two Americans and the Briton, all the other victims
were Zimbabweans, including a 6-week-old baby girl.
   The killers allegedly were led by Morgan Nkomo, a dissident
chieftain accused of other murders in the western province of
Matabeleland.
   Nkomo was among 115 guerrillas who a year ago laid down their
arms and turned themselves in to police to accept an unconditional
amnesty.
   The amnesty protects Zimbabwean army soldiers and guerrillas
involved in atrocities in Matabeleland, where they fought
sporadically for five years after Mugabe fired opposition leader
Joshua Nkomo from a coalition Cabinet. Last year, the two leaders
reconciled and merged their parties.

   Group by group they set out, and so they returned
to campuses 12 hours later.
   But in between, the many student groups coalesced to hold a
disciplined crusade for democracy and love-fest with the masses.
   Broad smiles, applause, ``V'' for victory signs and donations of
cash and drinks greeted the tens of thousands of students as they
trudged under a searing sun Thursday from campuses in northern and
eastern Beijing to central Tiananmen Square.
   ``Thank you, people!'' the students chanted back, exhilarated by
the welcome.
   The march began small and subdued compared with one April 27,
which was livened by repeated police efforts to stop them.
   Early risers on Haidian Road, where several schools are located,
asked each other, ``Have they come out yet?'' and peered down the
street for sign of student banners.
   But when the first groups of students emerged from their walled
campuses, singing out of tune, the reaction was disappointment.
``There aren't very many,'' said one bystander. ``Wait a bit, there
are more coming,'' was the students' answer.
   Come they did, from at least 55 schools, by tens and by
hundreds, until at Tiananmen they formed a mass 60,000 strong.
   Along the way they picked up zest, their chants grew firmer and
their singing stronger. They took as their march song ``The
Internationale,'' a stirring call for world revolution that was
blared from a loudspeaker carried on a three-wheeled car.
   Taxis, trucks loaded with cabbage and public buses steamed on
the hot asphalt, backed up in every direction as the protesters
swarmed over main streets. A taxi driver who stood by his idled
vehicle said he'd been stuck for an hour. ``It's no trouble, it's a
legitimate demonstration,'' he said, calmly smoking.
   Passengers on one bus pasted a sheet of paper outside their
window saying sympathetically, ``The students try hard.''
   Dozens of eager hands reached from cars and buses to snatch at
faintly mimeographed pamphlets distributed by the marchers. Many
people quickly tucked the sheets of paper into their pockets as if
they were contraband.
   ``The rights the people have won with their blood are turned
over to the bureaucrats,'' thundered one.
   The students marched past shiny glass-fronted computer stores on
Haidian Road, called Beijing's Silicon Valley; past construction
sites where workers in yellow hard hats waved their fists in the
air in support; past the Capital Theater showing ``AIDS Victims,''
a movie about the disease.
   Once in Tiananmen, they turned a giant portrait of Sun Yat-sen,
leader of a 1911 revolution, into a backdrop for a rally
celebrating their goals of democratic reform.
   ``We hope the people of China will support us,'' a student
leader shouted into a bullhorn. ``What is there to fear?''
   Students draped their banners over their heads for shade or
fashioned pamphlets into paper hats. Two girls spread their
``Advanced English'' texts over their heads.
   Three hundred students from the Arts and Crafts College stood
out in the sea of white and red banners. They all wore something
yellow: headbands, wrist bands, shirts, neckerchiefs.
   ``We think yellow is the color of democracy,'' said one. ``Red
is the color of repression.''
   By 4 p.m., the footsore and thirsty students had had enough.
   ``Return to your schools and continue to do propaganda work,''
exhorted student leader Wu'er Kaixi as he dismissed the crowd.
   Some left still weakly singing ``The Internationale'' with
parched throats.
   Bystanders lingered longer, shuffling through shards of broken
bottles and squashed plastic water containers, while a breeze
tossed paper across the vast square.

   Dr. C. Everett Koop, whose campaigns against
smoking and AIDS marked an often-controversial seven years as
surgeon general, told President Bush today he will leave office in
July.
   Koop, in a brief letter to the White House, said he had told
Bush in February that he would not serve out his full second term,
which ends in November. The surgeon general said he will leave July
13.
   Koop, 72, was appointed the government's top health officer by
President Reagan, and was sworn into office in January 1982.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan applauded
Koop's work, saying he has been ``a voice of honesty, integrity,
compassion and plain good sense.''
   ``There can be no doubt that during your term, America's
attitude toward tobacco use in particular has undergone fundamental
change. And of course, in confronting the challenge of AIDS, you
have set an example of professionalism and caring for all
Americans,'' Sullivan said in a letter wishing Koop well.
   Koop, in his letter to Bush, said James Mason, assistant
secretary for health, will name an acting surgeon general after he
leaves. The surgeon general heads the Public Health Service's
Commissioned Corps in HHS.
   In a statement, Mason praised Koop as ``an outstanding leader on
major health issues.''
   ``All of us in the Public Health Service and the medical
profession are proud of what he has accomplished. He has made
impressive contributions to public health,'' Mason said.
   Koop was not available for comment. His office said he was on
his way to a meeting of the World Health Organization in Geneva,
Switzerland.
   Koop did not say in the letter what his plans are after he leave
government. He has said in interviews that he would like to write
books and work in television on health issues.
   Public Health Service spokesman James Brown said Koop is
``working on several projects and further information will be
released on that in the future.''
   Under Koop's leadership, the office of the surgeon general
became an active and often controversial office.
   Koop maintained a vigilant campaign against smoking, calling for
a smokeless society by the year 2000 and worked actively on
education campaigns aimed at helping to stop the spread of AIDS _
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   When he was nominated by Reagan for the post, Koop was an
internationally known pediatric surgeon and was assailed by
liberals for his staunch opposition to abortion and for lacking
experience in public health.
   Social conservatives embraced him initially. As time went on,
however, they began to see him more as a traitor to their cause,
particularly after he issued a report on the AIDS crisis and
increasingly took to the airwaves to promote condoms, safe sex and
sex education as preventive steps against the deadly disease.
   Liberals, meanwhile, warmed to him and have applauded his high
profile on the AIDS issue.
   Urvashi Vaid, a spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, said Koop ``did an outstanding job on AIDS issues
because he put aside his personal beliefs and approached it as a
public health problem.
   ``He stood up for what he believed was the right thing to do in
terms of health policy even if it wasn't the right thing to do in
terms of politics,'' she said. Most victims of AIDS have been
homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of a House health
subcommittee, voiced deep misgivings when Koop was named. But today
he said: ``One of the great surprises of the last eight years is
how wrong I was. I take a great deal of pleasure in admitting how
wrong I was. If they could find a clone of Koop, they ought to
appoint him (as successor).''
   Gary L. Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research
Council who was an aide to President Reagan, said Koop occasionally
``caused great chagrin'' among some at the White House with his
comments, including his call for explicit sex education at the
earliest possible grade to stem the spread of AIDS.
   ``The approach he advocated deeply offends the values of many
parents,'' Bauer said.
   Despite his strong opposition to abortion, Koop recently found
support from abortion rights groups when he declined to issue a
report requested by the White House, saying he could not find
enough scientific evidence to determine whether abortion has
harmful psychological effects on women.
   Koop is the nation's 13th surgeon general, a position that was
created in 1870 as part of the Merchant Marine. Since the post has
little statutory authority, some presidents never filled the job
while others gave the title to the assistant secretary of health in
HHS.
   The surgeon general advises the public on health matters such as
smoking, health, diet and nutrition, environmental hazards and the
importance of immunizations and disease prevention.
   The holder of the position also oversees the activities of the
Public Health Service's 6,000-member Commissioned Corps.
   Koop said in his letter to Bush he would take ``terminal leave''
beginning July 13 and would retire Oct. 1.

   The fired captain of the Exxon Valdez
was ordered to stand trial next month on charges of being drunk
while his vessel crashed into a reef and spilled more than 10
million gallons of oil.
   Joseph Hazelwood, 42, pleaded innocent Wednesday before state
District Court Judge David Stewart to three misdemeanor charges of
operating a vessel while drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent
discharge of oil. He faces two years, three months in prison and
$11,000 in fines if convicted of all the counts.
   Paulette Foster, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's
office, also said a grand jury has begun an investigation to
determine whether additional criminal charges should also be filed
against Hazelwood, who was released on $50,000 bail. Hazelwood's
attorneys said they will seek to have the trial, scheduled for June
20 in Valdez, moved because of extensive news coverage. They have
not yet proposed an alternate location.
   Hazelwood is accused of turning over control of the
987-foot-long Exxon Valdez to an uncertified mate on March 24, when
it rammed a charted reef outside shipping lanes and ripped its
bottom, letting the Alaskan North Slope oil pour into Prince
William Sound.
   Authorities say Hazelwood, who has a history of alcohol-related
driving arrests in New York, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.061
percent nine hours after the accident. The legal maritime limit for
operating a vessel is 0.04 percent.
   After the spill, Hazelwood went home to Huntington, N.Y., where
he was arrested on a fugitive warrant. He returned voluntarily
Wednesday and surrendered. He had been free on $25,000 bail in New
York and a prosecutor said he would move to dismiss the fugitive
charge and return the bail money.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, was scheduled to tour the
spill damage tonight at Cordova and the heavily tarred Smith
Island. He was to be accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, Gov. Steve
Cowper, federal Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and Coast
Guard Adm. Paul A. Yost.
   At Smith Island beach, workers were constructing a wooden
platform from which Quayle could view the pollution.
   The state, responding to a request from Yost to evaulate Exxon's
revised clean-up plan, rejected the Exxon proposal, saying it was
inadequate and didn't provide for enough personnel to do the job.
   According to state environmental conservation commissioner
Dennis Kelso, Exxon is overly optimistic in projecting clean-up
progress and does not address several needs, including double
cleaning of some heavily oiled areas and removal of oil from the
water. Exxon also exaggerated the number of beaches it identified
to be cleaned only by waves, wind and rain, said Tom Ferguson, a
state spokesman.
   Exxon Corp. President Lee R. Raymond told reporters at a news
conference in New York today that too much bureaucracy could hinder
the cleanup effort in Alaska.
   Raymond said as many as 14 government agencies may be involved
in approving and carrying out the latest cleanup plan.
   ``I want some one person in charge _ I don't care who it is _
because there has to be one person that finally says `Hey, it's
midnight and we gotta do something,''' he said.
   Exxon has recommended cleaning 364 miles of Alaska coastline by
mid-September. But the company wants to leave untouched nearly 200
of those miles and let them be cleaned by nature. Exxon also wants
permission to bypass environmental laws to dispose of the oil
wastes.
   Both provisions have been criticized by environmentalists.
   ``The test should not be whether the oiling is heavy or light;
rather, cleaning should be done whenever the benefits to the
environment exceed the impacts from cleaning,'' Kelso said.
   Raymond said Exxon's plan was formulated with the help of
environmentalists. He also said that many parts of the plan were
misinterpreted, including reports that Exxon is considering
bypassing environmental laws with regard to the disposal of waste
materials.
   On Wednesday, state authorities reported increasing damage on
the Alaska Peninsula and at Katmai National Park.
   ``It's a very thick mousse-type stuff 6 to 8 inches thick''
hitting in blotches, said Bill Lamoreaux, a state environmental
official. ``It's definitely a difficult type of clean-up operation.
It's close to shore and rolling up on shore.''

   Her school had planned a trip to the Great Wall
on Thursday, but Kan Limei went to a demonstration instead.
   ``In my city, there is no student movement,'' she said, dusting
the dirt of 12 hours of walking off her clothes. ``I had to see
what the Beijing students were up to.''
   Kan, a 19-year-old sophomore from Yantai, a seaside city in
Shandong province, was one of several hundred students from schools
outside of Beijing who participated in the march.
   Either organized in tight little groups with a big red banner or
tagging along with a new-found friend from a Beijing school, the
``outsiders'' made their mark.
   ``Look,'' yelled a Beijing worker at one intersection as the
flags from schools across the country passed. ``It looks like all
of China's students are on the march.''
   Students from at least 10 other universities around China and
Hong Kong marched with tens of thousands of Beijing students and
their supporters, calling for freedom and democracy.
   Like many students from out of town, Kan was in Beijing on a
class trip to the capital to commemorate the 70th anniversary of
the May Fourth Movement, China's first student movement.
   ``I had a chance to choose between our ancient culture and the
future of China,'' she said. ``I took China's future. Maybe my
teacher will be mad at me, but it doesn't matter.''
   Waving his red Nankai University flag above his head, Li Ying of
Tianjin called about 30 of fellow students to fall in line.
   ``Let's study our classmates from Beijing,'' he said. ``Their
order is worthy of profound research.''
   Li came to Beijing especially to take part in the protest. A
student leader at Nankai in Tianjin, a port city just east of
Beijing, Li has helped organize a class boycott at his school and
several marches last week.
   ``If the student movement is going to get any results, it must
become a nationwide organization,'' he said. ``Seeing Beijing this
lively is good for us.''
   As he spoke, the crowd around him broke into a chant.
   ``Down with bureaucracy! Down with corruption!'' it said.
   Up until late last week, efforts to coordinate the protest and
enlarge its scope seemed to be failing. But on Tuesday and
Thursday, thousands of students from Fudan University in Shanghai
and other schools took to the streets to call for fundamental
political change. Students in Tianjin and Shanghai also began a
class boycott which like Beijing's is set to end Friday.
   ``These were our first political protests so far,'' said one
Fudan student of the demonstrations in Shanghai. ``Before that we
were just commemorating Hu Yaobang.''
   Hu was purged from his post as Communist Party chief in 1987 for
allegedly not cracking down heavily hard enough on student
demonstrations in 1986-87. As such he was a favorite of students.
   Hong Kong student Yu Sunsing, 26, from Chinese University, said
he supported the protest and hoped it would continue.
   ``We came here to find out more about them and to give them some
support,'' said Yu, who brought a donation of about $1,280 from his
school's student union for the movement.
   His university also had a rally of 3,000 people in support of
the Beijing march Thursday.
   At Beijing Normal University, a banner read, ``Classmates from
out of town.''
   ``We say in Changsha that if Beijing strikes it's history but if
Changsha boycotts, nobody cares,'' said one student from the
provincial capital of Hunan. ``I wanted to be a part of history.''

   Roman Catholic officials are interviewing
witnesses in an investigation of reports that the eyes of a
life-size crucifix closed during a Good Friday service in a church.
   ``There are no conclusions yet. We have no report for the bishop
yet,'' said Auxiliary Bishop William Winter, a member of the
investigative committee named by Bishop Donald Wuerl of the Diocese
of Pittsburgh.
   On Wednesday, the panel interviewed the Rev. Vincent Cvitkovic,
pastor of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Ambridge, where the
crucifix is located, and several others who were present during the
March 24 service.
   Cvitkovic said the plaster figure's eyes were about a third open
when it was moved in January from a corner of the church, where it
hung at eye level, to a more prominent position 15 feet above the
altar.
   He said the eyes closed to narrow slits on Good Friday.
   News reports of the incident drew thousands of people to the
church northwest of Pittburgh in the days following Good Friday.
   ``They're still coming, but probably not as many as when it
first happened,'' the pastor said Wednesday.
   He said some of the visitors are sick or handicapped people
seeking a cure.
   ``They all come here with hope,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A move to bar U.S. funding for any United
Nations organization that admits the Palestine Liberation
Organization as a member state won 10-0 approval today from a panel
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The move came as a warning in advance of a decision next week by
the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency, on the PLO's
application for full membership.
   The subcommittee on human rights and international organizations
acted after members declared that the PLO does not meet the
qualifications of a state under international law.
   ``It is not a government and does not meet the qualifications of
a state,'' said Chairman Gus Yatron, D-Pa.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said that if the WHO does vote to
admit the PLO he will introduce legislation demanding that the
United States suspend its recently opened dialogue with the PLO,
which has been accused of fomenting terrorism against Israel.
   The resolution endorsed by the subcommittee would forbid U.S.
contributions ``to the United Nations or any of its affiliated
organizations which grant full membership as a state to any
organization or group that does not have the internationally
recognized attributes of statehood.''
   It was not clear whether the full House would be able to act on
the legislation before the WHO votes on the issue.
   The PLO currently has observer status at the United Nations and
in its organizations but is not a full voting member.

<HEAD>Army Says Troops Violated Regulations in Raid That Killed Five</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with army report on Nahalin raid, Lebanese

   An army report released today said Border
Police violated regulations on the use of live ammunition when they
raided a village and killed five Palestinians. It recommended
punishing at least four officers.
   Also today, soldiers fatally shot a Palestinian who broke
through an army roadblock, and Arab assailants gunned down a
Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   In Beirut, a group calling itself Islamic Jihad in Palestine
claimed that one of its members was responsible for the stabbing
death Wednesday of two elderly Israelis in Jerusalem. Police have
said the man acted on his own.
   The army report resulted from an investigation into the April 13
raid by paramilitary Border Police on the West Bank village of
Nahalin. In the occupied territories, the Border Police are under
army command.
   Villagers in Nahalin alleged officers fired indiscriminately as
residents emerged from morning prayers.
   The officers said they fired after being confronted by
stone-throwing villagers. Five people died and at least 18 were
wounded.
   The investigation said there were ``deficiencies uncovered in
... operational planning, briefings and preparations, command and
control as well as deviations from regulations, including the use
of live fire.''
   It called for transferring to other posts the Border Police
commander in charge of the raid and his company commander.
   The report also recommended transferring the lieutenant colonel
in command of the army's Bethlehem district and reprimanding a
colonel in charge of the region. It did not give any names.
   The report, approved by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, also
called for possible disciplinary steps against two Border Police
officers.
   It urged a police investigation of all troops involved but noted
that in some cases the police faced ``life-threatening situations''
that would allow them to fire live ammunition.
   Army regulations call for troops to use tear gas and rubber and
plastic bullets before resorting to live ammunition to to disperse
rioters.
   But the report said villagers shared responsibility for the
bloodshed by inciting violence against troops who were carrying out
legitimate security duties.
   In today's clashes, a Palestinian was shot and killed when he
refused orders to stop at an army roadblock near the West Bank town
of Qalqiliya, a military spokesman said.
   And in the West Bank village of Mughayer, assailants shot to
death Tayseer Issa Assad, 28, after accusing him of collaborating
with Israeli authorities, Arab reports said. The army confirmed the
shooting and said it was investigating.
   At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the
17-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Two Israelis were killed Wednesday and three were seriously
injured when a Palestinian man shouting ``God is great!'' attacked
them with a knife as they waited at a Jerusalem bus stop.
   Islamic Jihad in Palestine released a statement to Western news
agencies today saying the attacker was ``one of our strugglers.''
The group also claimed responsibility for an attack at the Wailing
Wall in Jerusalem in October 1986 in which one Israeli was killed
and 69 wounded.
   But Jerusalem police said the attacker, identified as Nidal
Abdel Razik Zaloum from the occupied town of El-Bireh, maintained
he was acting on his own to avenge the arrest and beating of a
brother.
   In the West Bank, Jewish settlers launched armed patrols in
Hebron, saying they would fire on stone-throwers in the Arab city
of 79,000 people.
   Army orders restrict use of gunfire to life-threatening
situations. ``We will shoot to hit them, not to kill,'' patrol
organizer Aharon Domb told the Jerusalem Post newspaper.
   Early this morning in Hebron, 200 residents from the nearby
settlement of Kiryat Arba went on a rampage, smashing Arab cars and
throwing stones at houses, Arab reporters and Israel radio said.
   In the West Bank village of Mughayer, assailants shot to death
Tayseer Issa Assad, 28, after accusing him of collaborating with
Israeli authorities, Arab reports said. The army confirmed the
shooting and said it was investigating.

<HEAD>Poll Says Golden State's Image Tarnished</HEAD>

   California's allure is plummeting in the
eyes of its residents, according to poll results released Thursday
that showed the Golden State's image at its lowest point since a
survey began in 1967.
   ``The bloom is off the rose,'' said Mervin Field, director of
the California Poll.
   The proportion of residents polled who describe the state as
``one of the best places to live'' dropped 20 percentage points in
the past four years, from 78 percent to 58 percent. Twenty-seven
percent rank it as only ``nice but not outstanding.''
   Eleven percent describe California as ``about an average place
to live'' while 3 percent say it is ``a rather poor place.'' One
percent had no opinion.
   It's the first time since Field began asking this question in
1967 that the top rating has fallen below 70 percent.
   The poll was based on telephone interviews with 496 California
adults statewide over a 10-day period ended April 22. Field
reported a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage
points.
   In the San Francisco Bay area, 76 percent rate the state highly,
but that figure is still a decline of 7 percentage points from 1985.
   Only 49 percent in Los Angeles and Orange counties describe the
state as the best, a 24-point drop from a 1985 high of 73 percent.
   Field said that in the past the people surveyed cited climate
and ``living conditions'' as reasons for rating California highly.
   ``But with the increasing travails of housing, transportation,
crime, social problems and decline in political action by elected
leaders it all adds up to this growing disenchantment,'' he said.

   Don Johnson is back on the hook for a
Vermont income tax bill of more than $50,000 _ at least for now.
   The state Senate's Finance Committee on Wednesday killed a
provision of a new tax law that would exempt entertainers from
state income tax, retroactive to Jan. 1, 1986, and applying to
Johnson.
   The committee approved the exemption Tuesday, but 24 hours and
dozens of telephone calls from angry constituents later, the panel
reversed itself.
   ``We realized we had been rather hasty in this matter,''
committee Chairwoman Mary Just Skinner told her colleagues
Wednesday.
   The state had billed Johnson for money he earned in Vermont
while making the 1987 film ``Sweetheart's Dance.'' The movie and
television actor is best known for his starring role on
television's ``Miami Vice.''
   In a lengthy statement issued today by his press agent, Johnson
said he regretted that the issue had been ``personalized'' to focus
on him rather than the policy implications of the tax.
   ``The greater and far more important issue has ... far more to
do with the millions and millions of dollars in revenue that the
state of Vermont, i.e. the people, stand to lose as a result of
this decision,'' the statement said.
   Johnson called Vermont ``a place of scenic wonder,'' and said
that having ``this exquisite environment filmed and displayed in a
major motion picture ... was a picture postcard invitation to the
film audience to visit Vermont.''
   Tax officials had asked for quick action on the exemption,
saying Johnson had appealed his tax bill and threatened to spread
the word in Hollywood that Vermont was a bad place to make movies
if he were forced to pay it.
   Backers of the exemption, including Gov. Madeleine Kunin, said
it would make moviemakers more welcome in Vermont.
   Vermont's income tax is figured as 25 percent of a person's
federal tax liability.

   Legions of students marched through Beijing on
Thursday and occupied Tiananmen Square to mark the 70th anniversary
of China's first student movement with another stunning display of
their craving for democracy.
   About 100,000 people, more than half of them students, defied
police and peacefully gathered in the huge square for a festive
rally to seek greater freedom, cleaner government, a free press and
official recognition of the new independent student union that
authorities say is illegal.
   Students held much smaller demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing
and Changsha, and about 300 journalists from the official Chinese
media joined the student rally in Tiananmen. Throughout Beijing,
crowds of workers applauded the students and shouted encouragement.
   ``Perhaps the march will not bring democracy today, tomorrow or
the day after tomorrow, but if we keep working on it, China has
hope,'' said one worker who claimed he risked being fired by
attending the demonstration.
   ``We have to transform China,'' echoed an excited 20-year-old
sophmore from the Political Science and Law College, one of at
least 55 schools that participated in the rally, which capped a
remarkable three weeks of pro-democracy student demonstrations in
Beijing.
   After initially saying the student marches were designed to
undermine China's government, the communist leadership in recent
days has said that the demonstrators are being manipulated by
unspecified people and that most protesting students are patriotic.
   Student activists appeared ready Thursday to shift their
tactics. After six successful marches in defiance of the
government, they indicated future activity may not center on
demonstrations. They also announced that a nearly 2-week-old
boycott that shut down most Beijing university classes would end
Friday.
   Wu'er Kaixi, a leading activist, said setting up independent
newspapers would be among the new steps.
   The students _ chanting slogans such as ``Down with official
profiteering!'' and ``Patriotism is no crime!'' _ poured into
Tiananmen in the early afternoon after marching all morning from
their universities on the outskirts of Beijing.
   At a few intersections, marchers had to shove their way through
hundreds of unarmed police lined six deep across the road, but the
government clearly wanted to avoid serious confrontation. The
security presence was smaller than a week earlier, when about
150,000 students and supporters marched on Tiananmen.
   Although authorities had ordered the square closed Thursday, the
police who surrounded Tiananmen offered no resistance and quickly
left when the students arrived.
   Red banners bearing slogans and school names soon fluttered
above the square as students sat or milled about, some listening to
activists speak and others seeking shade, soft drinks and garden
hoses for relief from the hot sun. Throughout the afternoon,
students ferried countless boxes of popsicles to the sweaty crowd.
   The rally ended about 4 p.m., when the students began the
exhausting walk back to their schools up to 10 miles away.
   ``We haven't achieved our goals yet,'' acknowledged one Beijing
University student. ``I think this movement already is significant
... but we can't say, `That's it.'''
   Students returned to their schools by a different route than the
one taken the week before, disappointing workers who crowded
overpasses along the previous path to cheer the protesters.
   Support from the thousands of onlookers was obvious from the
beginning of the day, when they jeered police who attempted to
block the students and warned, ``You're not allowed to hit people.''
   Marchers gathered contributions from the crowds and distributed
pamphlets explaining their movement. Some students went into the
subway, throwing packets of pamphlets in each car. ``Workers,
peasants, soldiers, unite!'' sang other demonstrators as they
walked toward Tiananmen.
   One worker captivated marchers from Beijing Normal University
when he grabbed a bullhorn and gave an emotional speech of support
as he rode on the back of a pedicab. ``We should stand up for the
next generation,'' he bellowed in a voice raw from screaming.
   And as the students rushed into the square, an opera actor with
stained teeth proclaimed: ``This is a big day. I want to be here.''
He brought a camera to record the massive protest, as did thousands
of others.
   But a strong police presence in Shanghai prevented workers from
joining a demonstration by about 7,000 students, according to Jason
Hurtado, an American witness.
   In Nanjing, about 1,000 students from three schools marched to
the headquarters of the provincial government, an American witness
reported.
   The demonstrations marked the May Fourth Movement of 1919, which
was China's first student movement. Starting in opposition to
concessions granted to the Japanese government during World War I,
it developed into a movement calling for ``Mr. Democracy and Mr.
Science'' to save China.
   Officially sponsored celebrations to mark the 1919 movement were
held throughout China. Ironically, hours before the university
students invaded Tiananmen, 10,000 youths gathered in the square to
take the oath admitting them to the Communist Youth League.

<TEXT>
   Former California Attorney General Evelle
Younger, who as a tough district attorney oversaw the prosecution
of Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan, was found dead in his home
today. He was 70.
   Police were called to Younger's home in Hollywood at 8:30 a.m.
and found him dead, apparently of natural causes, said Officer Bill
Frio.
   Along with his public service careers as California's and Los
Angeles County's top prosecutor, Younger was a municipal and
superior court judge. In 1978 he was an unsuccessful Republican
candidate for governor.
   Younger described himself as a moderate Republican, tough on
crime issues and sympathetic to consumer and environmental concerns.
   When he lost the governor's race to Democratic incumbent Gov.
Jerry Brown, he had been in public service for 37 years, 25 of
which were in elected office. Younger went into private practice
after his defeat.
   Born in Nebraska on June 19, 1918, Younger attended Northwestern
Law School in Chicago as a student of criminology.
   He was admitted to the California Bar in 1946 and was a deputy
city attorney in Los Angeles from 1946 to 1950. He went in to
private practice in 1950 and became a Municipal Court judge in 1953.
   He was appointed to the Superior Court bench in 1958 and became
District Attorney in 1964. It was in that position that he oversaw
the successful prosecution of Sirhan, convicted of assassinating
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, and Manson, convicted of
masterminding the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and eight
other people.
   Younger served as California attorney general from 1970 to 1978.
   He was also chief of President Ronald Reagan's Task Force on
Administration of Justice.

   Six armed men flashing fake police
badges entered a museum and got away with millions of dollars in
art by such masters as Dali and Matisse, a museum official said
Thursday.
   Marcia Moreira, an assistant to the director of Rio's Chacara do
Ceu Museum, said the thieves arrived Wednesday night, showed their
fake badges to a guard and told him they were looking for men who
had just mugged a tourist.
   They tied up the guard and two other employees, stole paintings,
sculptures and tapestries and escaped, Moreira said.
   Marcio Fortes, the museum's director, said the lost works were
worth $30 million to $40 million and were mostly uninsured.
   Lucia Olinto, the museum's executive director, told The
Associated Press, ``We didn't have the money to insure the works of
art against theft. The only insurance practically any museum in
Brazil can afford is against fire and other disasters.''
   Among the most valuable works stolen, according to Moreira, were
a 1929 painting by the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dali, ``Les Deux
Balcons,'' or ``The Two Balconies.'' It was the only Dali on public
display in Brazil. The artist died Jan. 23.
   The Dali was insured, but only when outside of Brazil, Moreira
said.
   Also stolen was a 1905 painting, ``Le Jardin du Luxembourg,'' or
``Luxembourg Garden,'' by French artist Henri Matisse.
   Two Chinese ceramic sculptured horses from the 7th century T'ang
dynasty were taken, along with various other works, he said.
   The thieves left behind valuable paintings by Spanish master
Pablo Picasso, Moreira said.
   Police spokesman Jorge Marques Sobrinho said the robbers knew
what they were looking for.
   The museum, in the neighborhood of Santa Teresa, had been the
residence of the late Brazilian industrialist Raymundo Ottoni de
Castro Maya, who left his home and collection to the nation.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of riot police blocked an
anti-government rally Thursday, the day after six of their comrades
were killed and the president threatened to use emergency powers
against violent protest.
   About 8,000 riot officers moved into the downtown area of this
strike-bound port, arresting 433 workers and students to thwart a
rally called by labor groups to denounce President Roh Tae-woo's
government.
   Police armed with shields and clubs guarded factories and
patrolled streets, dispersing onlookers and keeping the area clear.
Officials said 800 people trying to reach the rally at Masan, 185
miles southeast of Seoul, were turned back at roadblocks.
   About 50 students held a brief protest in the heart of Masan,
chanting slogans, but fled when riot squads arrived. An estimated
4,000 workers who could not get to the rally site conducted
peaceful demonstrations at their plants.
   ``How can we march for our rights when there are so many
police?'' one dissident leader said, on condition of anonymity.
   In Seoul, a 24-year-old union leader at a garment factory doused
himself with kerosene and set himself afire to protest poor working
conditions, news reports said. He was in critical condition and a
fellow worker whose clothing accidently caught fire also was
hospitalized, the reports said.
   Many riot officers in Masan wore black mourning ribbons for the
comrades killed Wednesday in nearby Pusan, South Korea's
second-largest city, when police raided a college trying to rescue
five police officers being held hostage.
   The officers were climbing a barricade when radical students set
it afire, police said. The hostages were freed later.
   Roh said Wednesday he would use emergency powers if necessary to
halt weeks of violent protest by radical students and militant
workers trying to bring down his government.
   South Korea's constitution allows the president to rule by
decree or impose martial law in an emergency.
   Confrontations between protesters and riot police are common in
South Korea, but rarely are people killed. Officers carry shields,
wear helmets and fireproof clothing, and normally are armed only
with tear gas and clubs.
   Opposition leaders as well as government officials appealed for
an end to the violence after the deaths Wednesday. It was the
greatest loss of life in political violence since 1980, when at
least 192 people were killed in an ant9-government uprising.
   Police said Thursday they would charge five student leaders with
murder and arson, for which the maximum penalty is death. Police
also seek charges against 50 others.
   Legislators of the government and opposition parties agreed to
enact laws against firebombs.
   The Education Ministry was given authority to request police
intervention against campus unrest. Previously, the decision was
left to individual schools.
   In Seoul, a total of about 1,000 radical students shouting
``Down with the Roh regime!'' marched on at least three campuses
but avoided clashes with police.
   ``We will go ahead with our anti-Roh campaign, but this time we
think we have to restrain ourselves,'' a student leader said.
   Radical students are a vocal minority on campuses, but have
little public support because of their violent tactics and extreme
views. The government is concerned about their efforts to make
alliances with militant workers against the government.
   Roh has introduced democratic reforms, but the radicals contend
the former general is a front for the military.
   Farmers and radical students shouting anti-American slogans
demonstrated in Chonan and Taejon on Thursday against imports of
U.S. farm products and the stationing of American troops in South
Korea, according to news reports.
   Students have attacked U.S. government and military facilities
as part of a campaign for immediate withdrawal of the 43,000
American troops in South Korea.
   They contend the presence of American troops blocks unification
with communist North Korea. The peninsula has been divided since
1945 and the two Koreas fought a war in 1950-53.

<TEXT>
   A PLO official who was shot in the head
spoke Thursday for the first time since the assassination attempt
and was taken off the critical list, his surgeon said.
   Police have arrested several people in connection with the
attack on Issam Salem and the fatal shooting of a Palestinian
security officer, according to an official of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   At Hammoud Hospital, Dr. Hussein Mansour said Salem asked about
the swelling on the left side of his temple.
   ``He's still in the intensive care unit, but he is improving
gradually. He needs time. He's going to make it,'' said Mansour,
one of the doctors who operated on Salem for five hours after the
Tuesday shooting.
   Salem, 48, is PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's personal envoy in
Lebanon and is based in Sidon, the city 25 miles south of Beirut
that is the PLO's main power base.
   Mansour said Salem ``removed the oxygen mask early today. He's
breathing normally, so we didn't put it back again. His heart is
functioning properly and he doesn't have a fever.''
   Salem was taken off the critical list on the recommendation of
various physicians, he said.
   The PLO official in Sidon refused to give details about arrested
suspects. ``Several arrests have been made and we expect to make
more arrests,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   A day after Salem was hit, a lone assassin shot and killed
Bassam Hourani, a 30-year-old Palestinian security official.
   Sidon police said they have no explanation for the shootings
targeting pro-Arafat Palestinians, including a Saturday
rocket-propelled grenade attack on the residence of PLO spokesman
Zeid Wehbi. He was not home at the time, but two passers-by were
injured.
   Arafat has implied Syrians are behind the attacks because the
PLO leader backs Christians in sectarian fighting in Beirut. But
Wehbi on Wednesday blamed Israel, saying its secret service wants
to ``deal a blow to Lebanese-Palestinian coexistence.''

   Federal agents escorted at least four traders
from the floors of the New York Commodities Exchange and the New
York Mercantile Exchange today and subpoenaed others as part of a
criminal investigation of the markets, officials said.
   The U.S. Postal Service confirmed it was executing a criminal
search warrant at an office in a World Trade Center building where
the commodities exchange is based.
   John Slavinski, head of the New York office of the U.S. Postal
Inspection Service, said inspectors were executing two search
warrants for documents at the Comex and the Merc.
   ``A criminal investigation is underway and I'm not allowed to
comment further on it,'' he said.
   The raid came during a federal investigation of alleged
widespread illegal trading activity at Chicago's two futures
exchanges, which are the nation's largest.
   Market sources who asked not to be named said three silver
traders were taken from the Comex pits while at least one trader
was taken from the floor of the New York Merc.
   Comex spokesman Robert McGrath said subpoenas were being issued
to an unspecified number of commodities and oil traders who belong
to the Commodities Exchange Center, where the five New York futures
exchanges are based.
   ``We understand that per an order of investigation by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission ... that a number of subpoenas
are being issued to CEC members,'' he said.
   McGrath said some of the subpoenas were being delivered to Comex
members but did not specify how many.
   ``We have been asked to assist and cooperate with the CFTC,
which we are doing. We also understand that the exchange itself
along with other exchanges will be receiving a subpoena, which
obviously we will be immediately responsive to,'' he said.
   It was not immediately clear whether any traders were arrested,
nor what information was being sought. The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission is an independent federal agency charged with
regulating the nation's commodities markets.
   Robert Mignogna, a mail fraud section team leader for the Postal
Service in New York, said a criminal search warrant had been
executed at a World Trade Center office but said no arrest warrant
had been issued.
   Allegations of widespread fraud and cheating of customers at the
Chicago futures markets, the nation's biggest, surfaced in January
after disclosure of a two year federal undercover investigation at
the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Futures are agreements to buy or sell a commodity, such as
wheat, frozen orange juice or Treasury bills, at a specified future
date for a specified price. Investors use the futures markets to
speculate on price movements.
   The federal probe of the Chicago markets concerns allegations
that as many as 100 brokers at the two exchanges systematically
cheated investors out of millions of dollars through illegal
trading practices.
   No indictments have been announced but as many as 200 subpoenas
reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the exchanges.
   CFTC spokeswoman Kate Hathaway in Washington would neither
confirm nor deny there was an ongoing investigation of the New York
exchanges. She said the agency, like the SEC, cannot bring criminal
charges.
   In the past, the CFTC usually has utilized FBI agents or postal
inspectors in its investigations.
   Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman for the FBI in New York, denied
that FBI agents were involved in the incident.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne C. Ryan also declined comment on
whether an investigation was under way or whether her office, the
securities and commodities frauds section, was involved.
   Three separate commodities traders said a Merc trader was
escorted from the floor of the exchange and questioned by federal
agents. Other sources said three silver traders from a New York
commodities brokerage house were taken from the Comex floor.
   Other traders said floor activity was unaffected by the probe.
At midday, gold, silver and platinum prices were down, while crude
oil prices were mixed.
   ``I think things are getting blown all out of proportion,'' said
one New York trader who asked not to be named. ``One trader who
supposedly was taken out and put in a paddy wagon is trading in the
ring.''

<HEAD>Administration Agrees To Negotiate Sanctions Bill For Nerve Gas Users</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, reversing previous
U.S. policy, said Thursday it would support legislation providing
for sanctions against countries and companies that sell or use
chemical weapons provided the president is given discretion to
implement such measures.
   The decision, announced by Assistant Secretary of State Allen
Holmes to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was viewed as a
desire to influence a handful of sanctions bills that appear to
stand a good chance of approval.
   It also reflected the conciliatory tone adopted by the new
administration toward Congress on foreign policy issues such as the
agreement reached between the White House and Congress last month
for aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``We ... welcome the opportunity to work with Congress to
strengthen our tools for combatting CW (chemical weapons)
proliferation,'' Holmes said. ``In doing so, we accept in principle
that some form of sanctions, if appropriately formulated, would
give the administration an additional instrument against countries
that use CW and companies that aid proliferation.''
   The president already has open to him sanctions he can invoke
against countries that produce and use chemical weapons. He has
imposed such sanctions against Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iran in
recent years.
   But in light of revelations that Iraq used nerve gas and other
chemical weapons against its Kurdish minority and against Iran
during the nine-year Gulf war, Congress wants to legislate
mandatory sanctions.
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and the ranking Republican on the panel,
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, introduced two sanctions bills
following revelations last year that West German firms had helped
Libya build a chemical weapons plant near the town of Rabta.
   Both bills will probably be voted on next month. There are also
several other similar measures in the Senate and House, all of
which would impose automatic penalties on countries and companies.
   ``There's a lot of sentiment in Congress to take the whole thing
out of the president's hands and just mandate it,'' said Rep. Dante
Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Nonetheless, he praised ``signs of hope and change both in Congress
and in the executive branch,'' and said ``my hope is that we will
be able to join together in adopting a comprehensive policy.''
   Holmes argued that mandatory, automatic sanctions would tie the
president's hands. ``He has got to be able to tailor our responses
to individual circumstances and individual countries,'' Holmes said.
   Mandatory sanctions would also hamper U.S. attempts to rally
other countries around a global chemical weapons ban being
negotiated in Geneva and around various export-control measures
being debated by the so-called Australia Group.
   The group, which is comprised of the 12-nation European Economic
Community, the United States, Japan, Canada, Norway and
Switzerland, is meeting in Paris next week.

the damaged gun turret can be repaired for $15 million to $20
million.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said no decision had
yet been made to proceed with repairs but that the dollar estimate
was sufficiently low that cost was unlikely to be a factor in
resolving the Iowa's future.
   A more important question, Howard said, is likely to be whether
the ship should be withdrawn from duty immediately for repairs, or
allowed to proceed with routine deployments until its next
regularly scheduled overhaul.
   Howard disclosed earlier this week that a 35-member team of Navy
specialists had determined the materials and expertise were still
available to make repairs.
   The answer to that basic question had not been clear in the
immediate aftermath of the April 19 tragedy because of the vessel's
age. The Iowa was commissioned in 1943 during World War II and no
vessel of its type has been built since that war.
   Forty-seven sailors died in the explosion inside the No. 2 gun
turret while loading a 16-inch gun with powder.

   The University of Tennessee drove to first
place in a 1,100-mile marathon for cars than burn methanol, an
alternative to gasoline, sponsors said Thursday.
   Participants in the Methanol Marathon, sponsored by General
Motors Corp. and the Society of Automotive Engineers, were scored
on technical skill in converting a conventional vehicle into a
methanol-burner and on performance, such as cold starts, emissions,
noise, acceleration and driving.
   The Tennessee team scored 764 points. They were followed by
Concordia University of Montreal, Canada, at 653 points, and the
Rochester, N.Y., Institute of Technology at 643 points.
   The Tennessee team averaged 19.9 miles per gallon over the
route, which began in Warren, Mich., outside of Detroit and ended
in College Park, Md.
   Other teams and their scores were:
   University of Maryland, 608; Texas Tech University, 586; Wichita

   The U.S. government on Thursday deplored the
stabbings of Israelis by a Palestinian in Jerusalem.
   ``We condemn yesterday's senseless and tragic murder of two
Israelis as well as the wounding of three others,'' State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters.
   Ms. Tutwiler made no direct reference to further clashes between
Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
that followed Wednesday's stabbings.
   But she said:
   ``We are shocked and saddened by the increase in violence and
senseless killing arising from confrontation between Israelis and
Palestinians in the occupied territories. We urge all those who
truly seek peace to condemn such acts and to work together to
achieve a durable Arab-Israeli peace.''
   Israeli soldiers fatally shot a Palestinian who broke through an
army roadblock on Thursday, and Arabs shot a Palestinian accused of
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   The 17-month-long Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in
the West Bank, Gaza Strip and annexed east Jerusalem continues to
fuel Arab-Israeli tensions. Some 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis
have been killed in the uprising.

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa met
Tamil Tiger rebels Thursday and said he wants to end their
separatist war through ``consultation, compromise and consensus,''
the government said.
   Rebels and government officials met for five hours, sources said
after the first peace talks since the guerrillas began a bloody
ethnic war that has killed 9,000 people in six years.
   The negotiators are four rebel leaders and seven government
envoys, a government official said on condition of anonymity.
   After several refusals, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
made a surprise announcement April 15 that they would accept a
government amnesty and start peace talks.
   On Thursday, the leader of this Indian Ocean island said the
first stage of talks will decide modalities and identify issues,
according to a government statement issued after the rebels called
on Premadasa.
   ``Premadasa told the Tamil rebels he plans to restore peace
through a process of consultation, compromise and consensus,'' it
said.
   Sources said the two teams met at a well-guarded luxury hotel in
Colombo as police and sailors patrolled the capital in jeeps.
   Premadasa slipped quietly into the hotel for a few minutes as
the talks began, a witness said on condition of anonymity.
   Five Tigers in camouflage uniforms stood guard with AK-47
assault rifles, the government official said. Other witnesses said
the government deployed plainclothes security men armed with
submachine guns and revolvers.
   Air force helicopters brought the Tigers from their jungle
hideout in Vavuniya, 135 miles north of Colombo.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said Wednesday the rebels
agreed to a cease-fire during the talks.
   But a Tiger leader who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Thursday they also want Indian troops to halt operations.
   The Tigers are battling 48,000 Indian peacekeeping soldiers
deployed to disarm them. India became involved because its Tamil
minority sympathizes with the rebel cause.
   The Tiger guerrilla said if the present talks succeed, he
expects them to lead soon to negotiations including Premadasa and
Tigers' leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.
   The government also faces opposition from Sinhalese radicals,
who accuse the government of making too many concessions to Tamils.
Officials accuse the extremist Sinhalese People's Liberation Front
of killing 2,500 people this year _ mostly government officials and
supporters.
   Tamil Tigers in 1983 launched their bloody bid for a separate
nation called Eelam in the north and east, where the minority
Tamils form a majority. They charge they are discriminated against
by Sinhalese, who outnumber them 4-1. Most Sinhalese are Buddhists
and most Tamils Hindu.

<HEAD>US To Replace Seven Diplomats in Managua Expelled Last July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is sending seven U.S.
diplomats to Nicaragua to replace all but one of the American
envoys who were expelled by the Sandinista government 10 months
ago, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Nicaragua, in turn, will be allowed to replace seven of the
diplomats the Reagan administration had expelled in retaliation for
the ouster of the Americans.
   The upgrading of the respective embassy staffs does not reflect
an improvement in relations between the two countries but rather a
desire of both to be better represented in each other's capital,
according to U.S. officials.
   Last July, the Sandinista government ordered U.S. Ambassador
Richard Melton and seven other envoys out of Nicaragua on charges
they were fomenting unrest.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said all seven slots
below the ambassador level will be filled. In addition, four others
in Managua who are being reassigned will be replaced, bringing to
11 the number of new American diplomats being sent there.
   U.S. officials said the embassy in Managua has been operating
under considerable strain because the number of diplomats there has
been too small for the work load. The area most affected has been
reporting on political and economic affairs, according to the
officials, who asked not to be identified.
   Among those expelled by the Reagan administration was Ambassador
Carlos Tunnermann, who was accredited both to the United States and
the Organization of American States.
   Nicaragua objected to vigorously to Tunnermann's expulsion,
contending it was a violation of standard procedure to expel a
diplomat assigned to an international organization.
   The Bush administration's policy toward Nicaragua has been to
promote a democratic evolution there through political, economic
and diplomatic pressures. This represented a marked change from the
approach of President Reagan, who felt military pressure by the
Contra rebels was the only way to achieve that objective.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said that the United
States is prepared to make conciliatory gestures toward the
Sandinistas if they promote genuine democratic reform between now
and next February, when national elections are scheduled.
Otherwise, he has said, the administration will increase economic
pressures and take other steps against the Sandinistas.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Thursday opposed
legislation calling for a 10-year program to study the warming of
the world's climate and to require that federal agencies consider
the effect of their actions on the global environment.
   The House bill calls for coordinating research with other
countries and international organizations, including the World
Meteorological Organization and the U.N. Environmental Program.
   ``We oppose the enactment of the bill as unnecessary because it
duplicates existing government function and authority,'' said
Wiiliam E. Evans, undersecretary for oceans and atmosphere in the
Commerce Department.
   He objected to asking federal agencies to take the global
environment into consideration on the ground that the government
already has the power to do that.
   ``The administration is currently reviewing this issue,'' he
said.
   Dalas L. Peck, director of the U.S. Geological Survey, singled
out the bill's provision for a ``Council on Global Environmental
Policy'' as unnecessary because the federal government already has
the Council on Environmental Quality. He also opposed giving
Congress a say in setting the way the administration handles its
budget.
   Both Evans and Peck endorsed the purpose of the bill, which
seeks to advance scientific understanding of global climate changes
and to provide a basis for the government's policy decisions.
   It was introduced by Rep. Walter B. Jones, D-N.C., chairman of
the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Wednesday's
hearing was held by its subcommittee on Oceanography and the Great
Lakes.
   The bill was endorsed by Stephen H. Schneider of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., which is
sponsored by the National Science Foundation.
   ``Such a measure to coordinate federal activities in global
change research and the policy implications of global change is
long overdue,'' he said.

   A fisherman was attacked and
apparently devoured by a crocodile while swimming in the Zambezi
River in northern Zimbabwe, witnesses said Thursday.
   Sean Geasley, 24, who lived in Zimbabwe's second-biggest city of
Bulawayo, ignored warnings that the river was crocodile-infested
and dived into a pool, according to witnesses.
   About 230 feet out, Geasley cried ``Ouch!'' twice before
disappearing beneath the surface, workmate Dennis Green said.
   ``He did not cry out for help or even call my name,'' Green
said. ``I think he must have been in a state of shock. Because I
was very far from him there was nothing I could do to help.''
   When police later combed the river no corpse was found.
Crocodiles usually devour their prey.

<TEXT>
   Journalists from China's tightly controlled
official media joined students Thursday in an unprecedented
demonstration for freedom of the press.
   China's most outspoken newspaper, the World Economic Herald, in
its latest issue called for freedom of speech and the development
of independent newspapers, despite the fact that its editor was
fired last week for refusing to obey government orders.
   About 300 journalists, students and onlookers gathered outside
the rustic gates of the state-run Xinhua News Agency.
   Chinese reporters participating in the march said journalists
from more than 30 major newspapers and magazines, all
state-controlled, had joined the protest.
   After hoisting banners reading ``Don't make us tell lies'' and
``Citizens, China is yours,'' they moved down the street,
surprising residents who had not expected to see marchers coming
from their own neighborhood far to the south of Beijing's
university district.
   Xinhua authorities warned employees against joining the protest,
said two reporters. ``We had to sneak out. Many people were unable
to come,'' one said.
   On Wednesday, dozens of journalists of the official media
launched a petition drive to demand the reinstatement of Qin Benli,
former editor of the Shanghai-based World Economic Herald, who was
fired last week for refusing to alter articles officials said were
``likely to cause disturbances.''
   The respected weekly, which implicitly protested Qin's firing,
also called for an independent, free press.
   ``Political democratization is closely linked to press
democratization,'' it said. ``We need an environment for free,
truthful speech.''
   Reporters, many belonging to the Communist Party, have demanded
a dialogue with government officials on broader issues of
censorship, reflecting growing dissatisfaction with a system in
which much of their work is never released.
   Their protests have been prompted in part by tight government
limits on reporting of student demonstrations over the past few
weeks. Dozens of Chinese journalists have covered the protests, but
only a few newspapers have reported the scale and popularity of the
marches.
   ``Most of us young reporters at the People's Daily want to speak
the truth, but our paper is the most tightly controlled,'' said one
journalist. ``Since the students have shouted so much for a free
press, we should speak out, too,'' he said.
   When the journalists and student marchers converged on Beijing's
main thoroughfare, Changan Boulevard, there was an explosion of
applause, hand shaking and cheers.
   ``I think the journalists' joining us will give our movement
more strength,'' said one student.

<HEAD>New Drug Charges Filed Against Lewis, Friend of Barry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia
filed new charges Thursday against former city employee Charles
Lewis, adding one count of conspiracy and five counts of cocaine
distribution to the 10 charges lodged against him earlier.
   ``Today's indictment alleges signficant involvement by Mr. Lewis
in a pattern of narcotics trafficking over several years in the
District of Columbia and elsewhere in the United States, '' said
U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens.
   The new indictment alleges that Lewis, a resident of the Virgin
Islands, periodically transported cocaine from Florida to
Washington and neighboring Virginia.
   Lewis, a friend of Mayor Marion Barry, was originally indicted
April 13 on seven counts of lying to a grand jury and three counts
of cocaine possession. In a separate action, he was convicted April
25 of four counts of cocaine trafficking in the Virgin Islands.
   The federal investigation began after two city police officers
were called off an attempt on Dec. 22 to make an undercover drug
purchase from Lewis after Barry showed up at Lewis' hotel room.
Barry has acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the
affair but has said he was only trying to speed up the
investigation.
   Stephens said when the previous indictments were announced that
police had been cleared of any misconduct.
   One of the perjury charges alleges that Lewis lied about whether
he had possessed cocaine Dec. 22. Lewis was also charged with lying
about whether he had bought or used drugs with two companions Dec.
21, a day on which Barry reportedly visited Lewis' room twice.
   Thursday's indictment claims that Lewis possessed and
distributed a mixture containing an unknown amount of cocaine on or
about Dec. 10 and on or about Dec. 22 in Washington.
   Although Lewis checked out of his hotel room Dec. 23, before
police could search it or officially link traces of cocaine found
in the room to him, Stephens said investigators may have gathered
physical evidence to be used in the trial.
   Federal investigators also are looking into Lewis' role in
coordinating a $260,000 joint project involving the city and Virgin
Islands governments. Lewis was fired from the project, which was
supposed to revise the Virgin Islands government's personnel
policies and procedures, a year ago amid concerns about cost
overruns.
   The conspiracy charge and each of the distribution counts
carries a penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment and a maximum fine
of $1 million.
   Lewis is to be arraigned May 8 before U.S District Judge Stanley
Sporkin.

   The State Department on Thursday praised the
decision by Lebanese Christian Gen. Michel Aoun to lift his
blockade of ports controlled by Moslem militias in Lebanon.
   ``The United States welcomes the announcement by General Aoun
that he will suspend temporarily his blockade of the ports,'' said
department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``General Aoun's decision can strengthen the political process
under way to restore Lebanon's security and stability and to end
the suffering of the Lebanese,'' she said.
   The Christian blockade sparked artillery exchanges that began
March 6 and have resulted in 278 deaths and the wounding of 1,010
people, nearly all of them civilians.
   The State Department urged all parties in Lebanon to cooperate
with the Arab League effort to send observers to monitor the
cease-fire mediated by the league.
   ``We congratulate the Arab League and its committee on Lebanon
for the success it has achieved so far in arranging a cease-fire,''
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She also called on the league to renew its efforts to bring
Christians and Moslems to negotiations on power-sharing reforms.

<TEXT>
   The city attorney has asked the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission to look into Mayor Tom Bradley's
stock trades in companies that later were swept up in a major
insider-trading scandal.
   City Attorney James Hahn forwarded information on the trades to
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Hahn's spokesman, Mike
Qualls, said today.
   ``We did it on our own initiative,'' the spokesman said.
``Questions had arisen and we felt they were the ones with
expertise to look into it.''
   The mayor has ties to indicted junk-bond guru Michael Milken,
who was fired as the top bond trader for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. after being charged with racketeering and fraud in the
insider-trading probe.
   Hahn's statements came after he testified before a City Council
Government Operations Committee hearing in which city lawmakers
took up the issue of whether Bradley violated city conflict of
interest ordinances.
   City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg told the committee he takes
responsibility for a $600,000 deposit in federal grant money that
sat idle in a bank. That bank later paid Bradley to serve as an
adviser.
   ``Very frankly, we screwed up,'' Rittenberg said, explaining the
city's handling of funds from the federal Urban Mass Transportation
Administration. He said he was not pressured by Bradley to make the
deposit.
   Far East National Bank at one point held more than $1.3 million
in city money deposits and paid Bradley $18,000 last year as a
consultant. The mayor has since returned the salary.
   In addition to Far East National Bank, the city attorney also is
investigating the mayor's $24,000-a-year salary as a member of the
board of directors of Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association,
which has been involved in city business.
   Though Hahn wouldn't detail the SEC connection, it appears to
center on the mayor's 1985 and 1986 purchases of stock in two
companies _ Beatrice Foods Inc. and the Wickes Cos. Inc. _ that now
are part of the investigation of Drexel and Milken.
   The federal indictment of Milken alleges he manipulated the
price of Wickes stock. Congressional investigators have said they
found Drexel employees bought significant amounts of the junk bonds
used to finance a leveraged buyout of Beatrice.
   Hahn said he gave the SEC copies of the mayor's financial
disclosure statements _ on public file with the City Clerk _ which
describe both transactions.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder refused to comment on the matter
and wouldn't say if Bradley ever had an account at the brokerage.
   Bradley has close ties to Milken, a major contributor to the
mayor's political campaigns. Bradley helped organize an effort to
lobby Congress to persuade the SEC to allow Drexel's junk bond
division to remain in Beverly Hills after a federal investigation
began.

   Penelope, an African-born lowland gorilla that

died at age 35.
   She had lived at the zoo since 1957 and was its oldest lowland
gorilla.
   Penelope's keepers found her in critical condition early
Wednesday. Despite efforts to save her, Penelope died later in the

   The small, 3-year-old gorilla was a gift to the children of
Cincinnati from Nobel Prize winner Dr. Albert Schweitzer. He gave
Penelope to show his appreciation for a gift of goats and medical
supplies for his hospital at Lambarane, Africa, sent him by
Cincinnati residents.
   Gorillas usually live 35 to 40 years in captivity, zoo officials

<TEXT>
   A book of newspaper reports from the
turbulent days of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt has been published as
communist authorities allow a re-examination of the uprising
crushed by Moscow.
   The book, ``1956 In the Mirror of the Press,'' was published by
the Kossuth publishing house and contains newspaper reports from
Oct. 22-Nov. 5, 1956, according to the state news agency MTI.
   The revolt against Stalinism and Soviet rule began in Budapest
on Oct. 23, 1956, and was crushed by Kremlin tanks and troops sent
into the Hungarian capital on Nov. 4, 1956.
   The popular government leader of the revolt, Imre Nagy, and his
associates were imprisoned and several executed two years later on
charges of fomenting counterrevolution.
   That view of the revolt is under revision, with Politburo
reformer Imre Pozsgay declaring in January that the revolt was a
``popular uprising.'' Communist authorities have opened up archives
to historians.
   The bodies of Nagy and leading associates have been exhumed from
their unmarked graves in a Budapest cemetery and are to be reburied
on June 16, the 31st anniversary of Nagy's execution.

   Developers Edward J. DeBartolo and his
son, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., have donated $33 million to the
University of Notre Dame, one of the largest gifts ever made to an
American university.
   Most of the money will be spent in construction of a
computer-equipped classroom building and a performing arts center,
university board chairman Donald R. Keough, president of Coca-Cola

   Both DeBartolos are graduates of Notre Dame.

   Iran on Thursday hanged 27 drug
traffickers convicted on narcotics charges, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   The traffickers were hanged in Mashhad, near the northern border
with Afghanistan, where most drugs are smuggled into the country,
the news agency said.
   They had been wanted for importing, purchasing, selling and
distributing illegal drugs before they were captured, according to
the agency, monitored in Nicosia. The agency did not say when they
were arrested.
   The death sentences fell under a tough drug law that took effect
in January, and 543 people have been executed. The law mandates the
death penalty for anyone caught in possession of even small
quantities of narcotics.
   In one recent two-day crackdown, police rounded up 792 alleged
traffickers and drug addicts, Tehran radio said last week.

   Government officials said Thursday the
decision about whether to have nuclear missiles on its territory
ultimately rests with West Germany, not its NATO partners.
   The West Germans insist, over strong objections by the United
States and Britains, that East-West negotiations be held on
reducing the number of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Also at issue is whether to modernize the alliance's 88
battlefield-range Lance missiles, most of which are stationed in
this country and would be used here in case of war. West Germany
wants NATO to postpone a decision on modernization.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in an interview
Wednesday night: ``We have the first and last word about the
stationing of rockets on our territory, and no one else.''
   On Thursday, a government official said Genscher meant decisions
on nuclear missiles based in West Germany should be made by
consultation within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but
Bonn has the final say.
   ``We have to give our consent,'' the official said, speaking
privately.
   He noted Genscher's previous comment that West Germany's views
on missiles based within its boundaries must be given ``special
weight.''
   Alfred Dregger, parliamentary chairman of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party, was quoted as saying some
NATO countries refuse to understand why West Germany wants
increased efforts for disarmament.
   Those nations ``are not ready to acknowledge the strategic
situation of the only divided country in Europe, through which the
militarized border between East and West runs,'' he said, according
to the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
   It also quoted Dregger as saying NATO's ``foundations of trust''
could be damaged if the alliance does not show enough consideration
for the interests of individual members.
   NATO nations are trying to heal the rift before the alliance
summit May 29-30 in Brussels. West Germany claims nearly half the
16 members are on its side.
   Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg sent a letter
Wednesday to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, a West German
official said privately. He called it ``part of the decision-making
process'' but said he did not know the contents.
   Canada has proposed a compromise that calls for negotiations on
short-range nuclear weapons with the understanding that some
modernized Lances would remain and the Warsaw Pact's edge in
conventional forces would be ended.
   President Bush said Wednesday that starting negotiations on
short-range weapons now ``would be a mistake.''
   Baker and his 15 NATO counterparts are to meet in Brussels on
May 10-11. The weapons disagreement is expected to be the major
topic.

   President Bush today heatedly denied that he
ever told the president of Honduras there would be expedited
American aid in exchange for that country's aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Standing on the White House south lawn with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, Bush for the first time publicly addressed
head-on the question of whether as vice president he participated
in a purported Reagan administration plan to make quid quo pro
deals with Latin American countries to get help for the Contras.
   The president had refused to answer the question directly in
recent weeks as the Iran-Contra trial of fired Reagan
administration White House aide Oliver North was under way.
   But Bush noted that the North trial jury was about to deliver
its verdict, and he responded emphatically when reporters asked
whether he had assured Honduran President Roberto Suazo in March
1985 that the administration would reward his country for continued
help to the Contras.
   ``There was no quid pro quo,'' Bush asserted. ``Everybody that
attended the meeting says that there was no quid pro quo. And for
those who says there was, the onus is on them.''
   Less than an hour after Bush spoke, the jury convicted North on
three of 12 criminal counts.
   Bush declined to answer specifically when asked whether he had
discussed Contra aid with Suazo during the meeting. Asked whether
he had known of any quid pro quo arrangements between the U.S.
government and Honduras, he replied, ``Not to my knowledge.''
   The president complained that ``there has been much, needless,
mindless, speculation about my word of honor. And I've answered it
now, definitively.''
   New questions arose about Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair
last month when the government consented to the release of a
42-page finding of facts in connection with the sales of arms to
Iran and the diversion of proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   These documents contained memos and other documents suggesting
that Bush had acted as an intermediary in ensuring the Honduran
leaders that their assistance to the Contras would be rewarded by
expedited U.S. economic and military aid.
   Bush maintained today that records of his meeting in Honduras
with Suazo, ``demonstrate that there was no quid pro quo. ... No
implication, no quid quo pro, direct or indirect from me, to the
president of Honduras, at that meeting.''
   He said that in the aftermath of the North trial, ``I will
``insist that the congressional committees, now that the jury is
in, be briefed thoroughly on the confidential cables (describing
the meeting).''
   The president said there have been allegations that he went to
Honduras and discussed a quid pro quo arrangement with Suazo.
   He said that ``I can now state declaratively _ without any fear
of contradiction _ that there wasn't (a quid pro quo) _ and that's
all I am going to say.''
   Bush did not say whether he had personally reviewed the cables
that he alluded to in his statements to reporters. Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said recently that Bush had told aides privately
that he was not part of any quid pro quo arrangements with the
Hondurans.

<HEAD>Former Prison Guard Dies In Electric Chair</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Relatives of an 8-year-old murder victim
applauded Thursday outside Florida State Prison when witnesses
signaled that a former prison guard convicted of her murder had
been executed.
   Aubrey Dennis Adams Jr., 31, died in the electric chair for
suffocating Trisa Gail Thornley, an Ocala third-grader who was
kidnapped on her way home from school Jan. 23, 1978, and died in an
assault Adams claimed he didn't remember. Her mutilated, naked body
was found in a plastic bag 53 days later.
   The victim's mother, Ann Thornley, now living in Reliance,
Tenn., burst into tears and hugged her surviving daughter, Traci
Freeman, after the electrocution.
   ``I'm glad it's over. It's a decade too late in coming,'' said
Ms. Thornley, who left after the execution to visit her daughter's
grave in Ocala.
   She and other relatives clapped when the execution was confirmed
and again when an ambulance carrying Adams' body drove by.
   Seven capital-punishment opponents kept a silent vigil for
Florida's first execution since notorious serial killer Ted Bundy
died Jan. 24. Adams was the 21st man to die in Florida's electric
chair since the state resumed executions in 1979.
   ``We finally got justice today. I just wish my husband was
here,'' said Mrs. Thornley, whose husband, James, died late last
year of heart problems. ``This killed him.''
   Adams left a final statement with the Rev. W.J. Barfield, an
execution witness and pastor of the Church of God in Newberry.
   ``I hope and pray that all the new and reopened wounds will be
healed quickly after my passing,'' Adams wrote.
   Barfield said he and Adams talked all night, and that Adams
expressed remorse but never mentioned specifics of the crime.
   A large puff of white smoke rose from Adams' right leg when the
2,000 volts of electricity jolted him at 7:04 a.m. EDT. He surged
violently back into the chair, then was pronounced dead five
minutes later.
   Adams' attorneys made a whirlwind round of appeals Wednesday in
hopes of finding a judge to stay the execution. But the U.S.
Supreme Court voted 7-2 Wednesday night to reject Adams' emergency
request.
   Adams was linked to the crime when the family asked for a
telephone trace to find the source of obscene calls, and a call
made two days before the girl's body was found was traced to his
home.
   He admitted picking her up. He said he recalled that she
screamed and he placed his hand over her mouth to silence her. An
autopsy showed she suffocated.
   Adams, once an officer at Marion Correctional Institution, had
no prior criminal record.

   President Bush said today he is willing to
negotiate over a dispute in NATO over short-range nuclear weapons
but that he would not accept total elimination of the weapons or
permit the Soviet Union to maintain its superiority.
   Bush commented in a joint news conference with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney after the two leaders discussed the issue
during a White House meeting.
   West Germany has called for negotiations to reduce the
nuclear-tipped missiles and artillery shells, but Bush has rejected
the idea. The dispute threatens to disrupt the harmony of a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels on May 29-30.
   ``I want the NATO summit to be a success and we will be working
with the Germans and with others to see that there is a common NATO
position,'' the president said. ``This is no time for one to
compromise or somebody not to compromise.''
   Bush said the United States had made some proposals to Bonn and
``I expect we'll be hearing from them soon. ...''
   ``I'm always willing to negotiate, but we're not going to go for
any third zero (elimination of the weapons) or getting SNF (another
term for the weapons) out of whack in terms of negotiations. So
let's be clear on that,'' he said.
   Mulroney said that although NATO must debate the issue, ``in the
end there must be solidarity, total solidarity.''
   Mulroney was in Washington to dedicate his country's new $76
million embassy, the first ever built on Pennsylvania Avenue. It is
a modernistic, six-story building of Ontario limestone and
unpolished aluminum.
   The embassy was occupied in March, a year behind schedule, at a
cost of $76 million, nearly double the original estimate. But its
troubles were forgotten Wednesday evening as Mulroney and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III paid tribute to the enduring friendship
between their two countries.
   ``The maple leaf comes to Pennsylvania Avenue,'' Mulroney
declared.
   Baker said the new embassy ``conveys the warmth and openness of
the people of Canada'' and promised to give U.S.-Canadian ties
``the personal attention this friendship deserves.''
   With a smiling Baker at his elbow, Mulroney then took a pair of
scissors and snipped a royal blue ribbon draped across the main
entrance to the chancery building. Together, they went up to
Ambassador Derek Burney's penthouse office suite to admire the view
below.
   Their audience of several hundred dignitaries included
congressional leaders, Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, CIA
Director William Webster and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
   They feasted on shrimp, beef and salmon canapes and iced bottles
of Canadian ale while kilted bagpipers and a military band from
Ottawa performed on the courtyard outside.
   The dramatic building, designed by Vancouver architect Arthur
Erickson, is the only foreign embassy situated on Pennsylvania
Avenue, the ceremonial route linking the Capitol and the White
House.
   Standing on a 1.2-acre plot opposite the National Gallery of Art
and close to Capitol Hill, the embassy site was chosen to symbolize
the close historic ties between the United States and Canada.
   The land formerly was the site of boarding houses, a library, a
Ford automobile factory and most recently a city shelter for
homeless women. Former White House chief of staff Howard Baker once
called it ``the finest piece of real estate in North America.''
   The embassy's 327-member staff moved into the building a month
ago from its previous quarters in two buildings on Massachusetts
Avenue, the city's traditional ``embassy row,'' and rented space in
a downtown office building.
   Burney, who arrived shortly before Bush was inaugurated on Jan.
20, will continue to reside in an elegant, six-story mansion on
Massachusetts Avenue where Canadian envoys had maintained their
offices since 1928.
   The stone courtyard outside the main entrance features a
statuary pool, terraced greenery along office balconies and a
fountain surrounding a rotunda resting on 12 columns representing
Canada's 10 provinces and two territories.
   Inside the 287,000-square-foot building, whose ground floor is
shielded by bullet-resistant glass windows, are a 20,000-volume
library, a 175-seat theater, a small exercise room, an art gallery,
an underground garage and a ``safe room'' to guard secret
discussions against electronic eavesdropping.
   The start of construction, originally scheduled for 1985, was
delayed for a year because of spending cuts ordered by Mulroney's
government after he took office in 1984.
   Earlier, the government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau came
under fire when it selected Erickson, an old Trudeau friend, as
embassy architect after an independent advisory commission had
rejected Erickson in favor of four other architects.

   In a huge victory for consumers, the state
Supreme Court today unanimously upheld virtually every major
provision of the Proposition 103 insurance initiative.
   However, the court modified the measure's most important
immediate effect, a 20 percent rollback and one-year freeze on auto
and property insurance rates. It said it would allow exemptions for
insurers who could prove their rates were inadequate to earn a
``fair return.''
   But the justices rejected every other challenge to the measure
by insurers, who claimed it violated their constitutional property
rights. Insurers have said the measure will cost them $4 billion a
year and will drive many insurance companies out of California.
   The ruling requires auto, property and liability insurance rates
to be reduced 20 percent below November 1987 levels. But until this
November, insurers will be allowed to increase those rates.
   Through November, the court said, any increase above the
rollback level must be refunded with interest if the state
insurance commissioner later decides that the increase was
excessive. After November, state approval will be required in
advance for rate increases.
   Other provisions upheld include restrictions on geographical
rate-setting for auto insurance, a mandatory 20 percent discount
for ``good drivers,'' and a veto power for the state over future
rate increases. All those provisions take effect this November.
   It was a stunning decision by the conservative-dominated court,
in the face of widespread predictions that substantial portions of
Proposition 103 would be overturned.
   ``They did something nobody expected,'' said James Wheaton, a
lawyer for Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield. ``For the
first time in California history, consumers are going to have
protection from insurance company greed.''
   ``This is an inside-the-park home run for consumers, but
obviously the ballgame isn't over yet,'' said Attorney General John
Van de Kamp, who opposed Proposition 103 on the ballot but helped
to defend it in court.
   Insurers could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review their claims
that restrictions on rates and non-renewals of policies violate
property rights under the U.S. Constitution.
   In the one portion of the ruling that was a victory for the
insurance companies, Justice Allen Broussard wrote that the
proposition's standard for exemptions from the one-year rate freeze
was unconstitutional.
   But, in a crucial portion of the ruling, he said the invalidity
of the short-term standard for rate increases did not require
throwing out the entire initiative.
   ``The voters who enacted Proposition 103 would presumably prefer
rate-setting and regulation under the balance of the initiative to
the method of setting insurance rates which existed before the
initiative was enacted,'' Broussard said.
   After this November, Proposition 103 requires an insurer to
submit any rate increase in advance to the state insurance
commissioner, who will decide if it is ``excessive, inadequate or
unfairly discriminatory.'' The court left that provision intact.
   The court ruled one other provision of the measure invalid. It
would have required creation of a private nonprofit corporation to
represent the interests of insurance customers. The justices said
it violated a state constitutional provision forbidding the naming
of a private corporation to perform any function.

   Bombs killed a British soldier
and a prison employee Thursday, and the IRA said it planted the
first one to mark Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10th
anniversary in office.
   Cpl. Stephen McGonigle, 30, was killed in Silverbridge, near the
province's border with the Irish Republic, according to Armagh
police.
   Police said the bomb went off as soldiers examined a parked car,
but whether the explosives were in the car was not known.
   John Griffiths, a prison employee, was killed by a bomb that
exploded under his car. There was no immediate claim of
responsibility.
   Griffiths, a 37-year-old former soldier with two children, had
driven a short way from his home near Loughgall, County Armagh, on
the way to his job at the Maze Prison in Belfast, police reported.
   An Irish Republican Army statement distributed to Irish media
claimed responsibility for the Silverbridge bombing.
   ``We remind the British people on this the 10th anniversary of
Mrs. Thatcher's government that the Irish question remains
unresolved and cannot be resolved by military policies,'' it said.
   ``If Mrs. Thatcher continues to pursue military goals, the IRA
will have no alternative but to continue to bring the British
occupation of Ireland to the attention of the British public.''
   The IRA is fighting to drive Britain from Protestant-dominated
Northern Ireland and unite it with the republic, which is
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

<HEAD>Rally Calls for Removal of U.N. Envoy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Speakers at a rally mourning the deaths
of hundreds killed in a 1978 South African army strike on a black
nationalist camp Thursday urged the United Nations to replace its
envoy in Namibia.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar said South African forces in Namibia should be confined
to their barracks as soon as possible and called on Pretoria to
restrain police there.
   Supporters of the guerrilla South-West Africa People's
Organization rallied at Katatura, the black township outside the
territorial capital of Windhoek, and called for the immediate
replacement of U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari.
   They accused Ahtisaari, a Finn, of incompetence for agreeing to
release South African troops to fight an April guerrilla incursion
from Angola that nearly derailed U.N. plans to hold independence
elections in November.
   Two Irish U.N. monitors were the only policemen visible at the
rally of 1,000.
   State radio reported ``visible tension'' when 5,000 people
rallied in northern Ongwediva. The town is near the fortified
military base of Oshakati in northern Namibia, where more than 300
men, mostly guerrillas, have been killed in a month's fighting.
   In Windhoek, 40 youths picketed the U.N. police post, carrying
signs demanding the United Nations immediately take over
administration of the territory South Africa has ruled for 74 years.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani told reporters Thursday that
Perez de Cuellar expressed to South African Ambassador Jeremy B.
Shearar his ``grave concern'' about Namibia.
   At a Wednesday meeting, Perez de Cuellar cited charges of
brutality and intimidation and urged ``everything be done to
restrain the conduct of the South African police.''
   He also said South African defense forces ``should be confined
to barracks now, as soon as possible.''
   In his turn, Shearar warned 300 to 350 guerrillas likely would
try to infiltrate into Namibia on Wednesday and Thursday. The
United Nations had no such indications, Giuliani said.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said he was gratified
to learn there had been no massive overnight incursion.
   Pretoria says the guerrillas violated the U.N. peace plan.
Guerrilla leaders, who were not signatories to the plan agreed by
South Africa, Cuba and Angola, said they crossed the border because
they believed the United Nations had set up bases for them in
northern Namibia.
   After negotiations, most infiltrators returned to Angola and it
was agreed South African forces would return to barracks by May 13.
But Perez de Cuellar wants that timetable shortened, Giuiliani said.
   Pretoria agreed to give independence to Namibia in exchange for
the removal from Angola of 50,000 Cuban troops helping that
government fight right-wing rebels backed by the United States and
South Africa.
   Thursday's anniversary is called Cassinga Day after the Angolan
town South African troops attacked 150 miles north of the border
with Namibia.
   The guerrilla organization says South African paratroopers
killed 582 Namiban refugees camping at Cassinga, including 120
children. Pretoria says Cassinga was the guerrillas' main
operational base and about 1,000 guerrillas and six of its soldiers
died.

   A court Thursday convicted a Taiwanese
taxi driver and his girlfriend of kidnapping a 9-year-old Japanese
boy.
   Wang Nai-li was sentenced to life imprisonment and his
girlfriend, Chiu Wen-fang, was sentenced to 14 years in jail.
   Wang, 32, and Miss Chiu, 23, confessed to kidnapping Tetsuyoshi
Ohta on May 27, 1988, and holding him for six days. The Taipei
District Court said that Wang and Miss Chiu denied receiving the
$63,000 ransom paid by Ohta's parents.
   Ohta, a student at the Taipei Japanese School, told police he
spent three days locked in the trunk of Wang's taxi before he was
taken to the taxi driver's apartment.
   Chiu said she had needed the ransom money to pay for medical
expenses.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the Magellan probe to cloud-shrouded Venus for the best
look yet at Earth's nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the Florida sky
at 2:47 p.m. EDT, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. NASA had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting NASA administrator
Dale Meyers.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft Magellan, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The $550 million craft, which had to be launched
by May 28 or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. Magellan is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the Kennedy Space Center emergency landing site.
   NASA's first attempt to launch Atlantis last Friday was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander David M.
Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard,
Mary Cleave and Mark Lee.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send Magellan out of Earth orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching Venus.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above Earth
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
Monday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path Magellan
must follow to reach Earth's mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until May 28. At that point, Earth and Venus would have moved out
of alignment and the Magellan mission would not be possible for two
years.
   Magellan marks the beginning of a new era in a U.S. planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since 1978.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but Venus is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The Earth orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by Venus because it is so close in size
to Earth, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the Earth, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on Earth, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that Venus' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   Magellan will rendezvous with Venus in August 1990. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to Earth for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   Magellan is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what Lennard Fisk, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
America's planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in 1978, was the last U.S. space launch and Fisk
said America ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will fly past Neptune in August. It
earlier visted Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. In October, the robot
craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in 1990,
and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said Fisk.

<HEAD>The Next Defendants In The Dock: Fernandez and Poindexter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial is
over, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh can focus on trying the
next major case, against North's former boss John M. Poindexter.
   Poindexter, who was national security adviser to President
Reagan, not only is charged with obstructing congressional
inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair; he also faces the central
conspiracy counts that were dropped against North when the Bush
administration refused to disclose secret documents needed by the
defense.
   Because Poindexter, unlike North, had daily contact with Reagan,
his trial could shed new light on how closely the former president
might have been involved in the secret plans to sell arms to Iran
and to keep the Contras going after official U.S. aid was banned.
   The case against Poindexter is expected to go to trial in
September.
   Before then, a lower-ranking figure in the affair, former CIA
agent Joseph F. Fernandez, is to go to trial July 10.
   Fernandez has pleaded innocent to four charges that he lied and
obstructed investigations by the presidential commission headed by
former Sen. John Tower and by the CIA's inspector general.
   The former CIA station chief in Costa Rica is accused of lying
about his role in setting up an airstrip in Costa Rica as part of
the Reagan administration's effort to help the Nicaraguan rebels at
a time when official U.S. aid was banned.
   As for Poindexter, Walsh has expressed determination to press
forward against him with charges that were dropped against North:
That the two men and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V.
Secord conspired to divert $15 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale
profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The independent counsel told U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.
Robinson Jr. that release of secret documents during North's trial
_ and a softening of the intelligence agencies' opposition to
further disclosures _ may enable the prosecution to proceed with
those charges against Poindexter.
   Walsh also said that some of the most sensitive documents a
judge ruled were needed in North's trial were not relevant to
Poindexter's case.
   Many of the documents the government kept out of North's trial
dealt with covert operations to free U.S. hostages in the Middle
East and other secret activities in Central America.
   As a participant in covert operations, North persuaded U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell that he needed the material to
help his defense. When it was kept secret, the conspiracy charges
against North were dropped.
   But Walsh is expected to argue that since Poindexter was not a
participant in covert operations, he is not entitled to use the
same documents to defend the charges that he was a participant in a
conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government of arms-sale profits.
   Since North testified that Poindexter knew of his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, prosecutors may force the former National
Security Council aide to testify against his former boss.
   A judge could order North to testify against Poindexter on
condition that his testimony not be used as evidence against him if
he is granted a new trial by an appellate court.
   Poindexter, 52, is also charged with obstructing 1986
investigations of the House and Senate intelligence committees into
the Iran-Contra affair. The charges include allegations he helped
prepare a false chronology of the U.S.-Iran arms deals and
destroyed computerized files he kept at the NSC.
   The seven charges against Poindexter each carry five-year prison
terms and $250,000 fines.
   After Poindexter's trial, Walsh's office plans to proceed with
the charges against Hakim and Secord, also scheduled to be tried
separately.

<HEAD>Troops Violated Rules in Village Raid Last Month, Army Probe Says</HEAD>

   Israeli troops violated regulations and engaged
in ``excessive use of fire'' in a raid on a West Bank village last
month that left five Palestinians dead, according to an army
investigation released Thursday.
   The report calls for a police inquiry to determine if criminal
charges should be filed against seven paramilitary Border Police
involved in the incident in the village of Nahalin near Bethlehem,
said army spokesman Lt. Col. Raanan Gissin.
   It also recommends that two Border Police commanders and one
army commander be transferred from duty in the occupied territories
and that another army commander be reprimanded, he said.
   There were ``discernable deviations (from orders),
transgressions and excessive use of fire'' in the incident April
13, Gissin said.
   The army says it has disciplined soldiers in about 50 cases in
the 17-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Thursday's report was unusual in its singling out high-ranking
officers and its public release at a news conference.
   But the strongest recommendation was that disciplinary action
``should be considered'' against police officers. In its Human
Rights report in February, the U.S. State Deparment complained of
lenient treatment of troops accused in fatalities and said ``many
cases'' were not prosecuted.
   Also on Thursday, troops fatally shot a Palestinian who broke
through an army roadblock in the West Bank, and Arab assailants
shot to death a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli
authorities.
   The deaths brought to 460 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising. Twenty Israelis have died in the violence.
   In Beirut, a group calling itself Islamic Jihad in Palestine
claimed one of its ``strugglers'' was responsible for a stabbing
attack in downtown Jerusalem that killed two Israelis and wounded
three Wednesday.
   Police said the were still investigating the claim by the
attacker, Nidal Abdel Rizik Zaloum, that he acted on his own in
revenge for the arrest and beating of a brother.
   In Jerusalem, a 41-year-old Palestinian died of burns suffered
Sunday when his kerosene-laden car exploded as it was passing a
downtown police station, said police spokesman Uzi Sanduri.
   Police initially said the man may have been planning a car
bombing. Sanduri said Thursday ``at this point we don't think it
was a bomb, but we're still checking.''
   The army investigation into the Nahalin incident was launched
after villagers complained it was a ``massacre'' in which border
police opened fire without warning and attacked cars carrying
wounded civilians to hospitals.
   The border police operate under army jurisdiction in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 13 villagers were injured, the report said, and four
border policemen were hurt, none seriously.
   Gissin said that the 25-man Border Police force entered Nahalin
before dawn to search for Palestinians suspected of throwing
firebombs and rocks at cars.
   He said that about 100 village youths armed with rocks and
firebombs ``ambushed'' the patrol, and that seven of the troops in
the center of the village found themselves ``in a life-threatening
situation.''
   But this squad, he said, ``did not exhaust its non-lethal means
and opened fire immediately.'' In response to a question, Gissin
said ``in this particular incident, only live ammunition'' was used.
   Army regulations calls for troops to use tear gas, rubber
bullets and plastic ammunition before firing ``live'' lead rounds.
   The names of the Border Police officers _ a captain and a major
_ and the names of the army officers _ a lieutenant colonel and a
colonel _ were withheld under military regulations.
   In the shooting death of a Palestinian on Thursday, an army
spokesman said troops shot and killed a man who tried to run a
roadblock in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya.
   Also in the West Bank, assailants shot to death Tayseer Issa
Assad, 28, in Mughayer village on suspicion that he collaborated
with Israeli authorities, Arab reports said. The army confirmed the
death.
   Also Thursday, a leading Palestinian intellectual, Sari
Nusseibeh, was named in court papers charging four Palestinians
with writing leaflets for the Palestinian uprising and passing
funds for financing the revolt.
   Nusseibeh was described as taking part in both actions but was
not charged. He denied playing such a role and told the national
news agency Itim: ``This is the sort of game played by people who
rule over us. They're trying to create an imaginary leadership.''

legend James Brown a belated 56th birthday visit in prison Thursday.
   Brown, the self-proclaimed ``Godfather of Soul,'' did not have
any visitors on his birthday Wednesday, said Bennish Brown, a

not related to the singer.
   Jackson, who appeared before the state parole board on Brown's
behalf March 8, declined to talk to reporters on his way into the
prison.
   Brown is serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault and
failing to stop for police during a Sept. 26 chase across the

   He works on kitchen detail in the mornings. In the evenings,
Brown, whose gold records include ``Please, Please, Please,'' and
``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' conducts the prison choir.

   Vermonters will lose millions of dollars
if they tax movie stars making films in their states, actor Don
Johnson warned Thursday.
   Johnson's comments came in a statement a day after a legislative
committee reversed itself and killed a provision of a new law that
would have exempted entertainers from state income tax. It was
retroactive to Jan. 1, 1986, and would have saved Johnson $50,000.
   The Senate Finance Committee approved the exemption Tuesday, but
24 hours and dozens of telephone calls from angry constituents
later, the panel reversed itself.
   The state billed Johnson for money he earned in Vermont while
making the 1987 film ``Sweetheart's Dance.'' The actor is best
known for his starring role on television's ``Miami Vice.''
   Johnson appealed his tax bill and threatened to spread the word
in Hollywood that Vermont was a bad place to make movies.
   Johnson said Thursday he pays his fair share in taxes already.
``I have never attempted to avoid my personal financial
responsibilities with respect to the funding of governmental
services. I am not a resident of Vermont and do not make use of the
various services provided by that state.''
   Backers of the exemption, including Gov. Madeleine Kunin, said
it would make moviemakers more welcome in Vermont.
   Vermont's income tax is figured as 25 percent of a person's
federal tax liability.

   Estelle Getty, who portrays an

hospitalized senior citizens and told them not to fade into the
woodwork.
   As the actress shook hands Wednesday with members of Mercy
Medical Center's Prime Timers group, Viola Wetzel of Cedar Rapids

   ``You're 94?'' said Getty. ``You look better than I do!''
   Wetzel was surprised Getty is considerably younger than the
85-year-old Sophia Petrillo she portrays on TV.
   Getty, who is in her early 60s but won't disclose her age, says
the show's producers weren't sure they wanted a younger woman to
play Sophia.
   ``I told them, `Where are you ever going to find an 85-year-old
woman who will come in to work everyday?''' Getty said.
   ``If there's just one thing I hope the show and my character
tell you is that you can get older without growing old. There's no
need to fade into the woodwork when you reach 60 or 70 or 80.
You've got to keep at it.''

<HEAD>Deputy Defense Secretary Says Pentagon Considers Options on Aircraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is considering two options that
could temporarily stave off elimination of the V-22 Osprey aircraft
program, Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood Jr. said Thursday.
   Atwood told the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee that
the Defense Department is considering either continuing the Osprey
through a ``flight test program'' or a ``minimal effort of
technology demonstration.''
   Both options would require reprogramming of money, according to
Atwood, who said $330 million exists for long-lead materials for
production of 12 aircraft. The funds could be used if Congress
approved.
   ``We hope to have a decision within a matter of a day or so,''
Atwood told the panel.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, faced with an agreement by the
White House and Congress requiring a $10 billion cut in the fiscal
1990 defense budget, decided to eliminate the Marine Corps'
battlefield aircraft which is designed to take off like a
helicopter but fly like an airplane.
   The Pentagon had hoped to spend $25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys,
including $1.3 billion in 1990. Over a nine-year period, the
department had invested $2 billion in the program.
   Cheney's decision, which he has termed his most difficult, has
met with considerable opposition on Capitol Hill, including some
from Republicans.
   Sens. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., lashed
out at the termination of the program as they questioned Atwood
about the Pentagon budget.
   The Defense Department ``appears ... to be playing games with
us,'' Stevens told Atwood. ``The Defense Department knows how
strongly Congress feels about it and intends to put it back in,''
he added.
   Stevens said he would not vote for any defense bill that does
not include funding for the Osprey program.
   Specter, who discussed the issue with Atwood before the hearing,
said the department should ``explore the possibility of maintaining
at least enough efforts to keep Bell in operation to maintain the
status quo while this matter is evaluated by the Congress. This is
not some peripheral issue where the Congress is likely to accede.''
   The Pentagon faced a deadline because the Osprey's two
contractors, Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., and Boeing Helicopter
Co., have said they will stop work on the project Friday.
   Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said the companies
received $245.8 million in March on their fiscal 1989 contract and
the Navy expects completion of the contract.
   However, the companies are facing a debt of $27 million and have
been using their own money. The cost overrun is about $25 million a
month and may go as high as $150 million by the end of fiscal 1989.
   Howard said ``what we have here is a game of high-stakes
chicken.''
   ``The intent of the DoD is very clear. We are not at fault. The
contractor (has) expended more money in the program than it
anticipated when it bid,'' Howard said.
   ``The secretary's determination has been that we will not issue
a stop-work order; that we will continue to require the contractor
to complete the testing program under the terms of the contract,''
Howard said.
   Meanwhile, the commandant of the Marine Corps cast doubt on the
information Cheney used in deciding to eliminate the Osprey.
   ``I do not agree with the cost advice that he got nor do I agree
with the military operation use and conceptual framework of that,
but then I'm but one voice,'' Commandant Alfred Gray told the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Gray praised the Osprey as an aircraft ``that has enormous
commercial potential ... and one that is not only for your corps
Marines.'' Nevertheless, he said he supported Cheney's decision.
   ``Do you believe Secretary Cheney made the best decision he
could make based on faulty information?'' asked Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   ``No,'' responded Gray, ``but based on the information he was
given by learned people who have their right to believe that
they're correct.''
   ``But you don't believe they're correct,'' Nunn said.
   ``No, I don't, but I had my day in court,'' said Gray, who plans
to submit to the committee his interpretation of the program's cost
benefits.

<TEXT>
   Property owners won the right to keep the
public off a popular beach, but as the sunbathing season
approaches, town officials say there will be no way to keep people
off the sandy stretch.
   ``It almost seems like we're going back to square one, back to
where we started,'' said Joe Magne, one of the property owners who
prevailed in a decision by the Maine's highest court.
   The divided court ruled in March that public access to the
mile-long Moody Beach is limited to fishing, bird-hunting and
boating on the basis of a 17th century colonial ordinance.
   Maine's attorney general and officials from Wells, a town with a
population of about 10,000, fought to keep the beach open, fearing
a closed beach could harm the state's tourism industry. Maine's
meandering coast is 3,500 miles long, but most of the shoreline is
rocky. Just about 35 miles of sandy beaches are available.
   Wells Town Manager Jonathan Carter requested that Moody Beach
property owners meet with town officials Sunday to discuss two
options for beach use this summer.
   Under the town's first proposal, property owners would agree to
make the beach public and the town will maintain it. Under the
second option, access to the beach would be controlled by the
property owners, but town officials point out that keeping
unauthorized people away would be difficult.
   If police are called with trespassing complaints, they will
handle the complaints like any other non-emergency, Carter said.
Police would enter the beach through the complaining property
owner's home, and the trespassers would merely have to move a few
feet away onto another person's land to satisfy police, Carter said.
   Any complaints taken to court probably would get backlogged
until the tourists are long gone, the town manager said.
   ``It would probably be put off until, say, November,'' Carter
said.
   Carter rejected the suggestion that the town is using the threat
of such delays to make property owners reluctant to complain about
unwelcome tourists.
   But property owners believe the town is trying to set up terms
for beach use even though it lost in court.
   ``To my way of thinking, they're sort of condoning
trespassing,'' said Dr. Warren Jones, one of the litigants.
   Jones said people have used the area around his home and even
under his steps as a toilet.
   ``I'm not the old curmudgeon that wants to keep everyone from
walking across his land,'' Jones said. ``All we ever wanted was
control of our own property. If we're planning a big family picnic,
I want to be able to ask people to leave.''
   Some Wells residents who don't own beachfront land see the
property owners as mean-spirited wealthy people trying to keep
Mainers and visitors from enjoying the beach.
   ``That's nature out there,'' said Luke Nuccio. ``That doesn't
belong to me or you or anyone. Nature's for everybody. Native Maine
people never thought this could happen.''
   ``I plan to waitress in the morning and come to the beach in the
afternoon this summer,'' said schoolteacher Ann French. ``I never
thought this would happen. I think it's going to bring out the
worst in people.''
   Both sides predict that no matter how the issue is resolved,
publicity given to the court case probably will keep some tourists
away, or at an adjacent public beach in Ogunquit.
   The battle over access to Moody Beach may finally be resolved
with the town or the state seeking to acquire the beach through the
government's legal right of eminent domain, both sides said. The
town asked appraisal companies to submit proposals for the beach to
buy as a recreational easement or to take fees for use of Moody
Beach.

<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North, the Marine at the shadowy
center of the Reagan administration's secret effort to arm the
Nicaragua Contras, was convicted Thursday of shredding documents
and two other charges in the Iran-Contra affair. He was acquitted
on nine other counts.
   North, who faces up to 10 years in prison on the convictions,
accepted the verdict without any show of emotion. But a congressal
supporter described him as ``absolutely elated'' at the jury's
decision.
   After judge and jury had left the room, North walked to a
railing separating him from his wife, Betsy, and kissed her lightly
on the cheek. Mrs. North had been sitting in the front row with a
clergyman.
   North left the courthouse with his wife and his lawyer. They
made no comments to the crowd of reporters and onlookers.
   It was the first trial born of the scandal that marred the last
two years of Ronald Reagan's presidency and raised questions about
then Vice President George Bush's involvment in the
administration's clandestine effort to arm the Contras. Even as the
jury was returning its verdict, Bush told reporters at the White
House that he did not participate in any arrangement to expedit aid
to other countries in exchange for their support for the Contras.
The White House said Bush would have no comment on the verdict.
   In Los Angeles, former President Reagan also declined comment.
   North's defense was that he had been a good soldier loyally
carrying out what he knew his commander-in-chief, the president,
wanted.
   ``The principle that no man is above the law has been
vindicated,'' said prosecutor John Keker, who refused to answer
reporters' questions.
   Keker, in a brief statement on the courthouse steps, told
reporters, ``Some said the system of justice could not deal
effectively with this case. Some even said it could not be tried.
Col. North has been convicted of three very serious charges. The
jury has spoken.''
   North, 45, was pale and smiling nervously as he entered the
courtroom where his trial began with jury selection more than three
months ago.
   The former Marine lieutenant colonel, twice wounded in the
Vietnam war and decorated with the Silver Star for heroism,
remained seated while the judge read the verdict.
   His three daughters and one son were not in the courtreoom,
which was crowded with reporters, sketch artists, lawyers and a few
members of the public. The nine women and three men on the jury did
not look at North as they filed into their seats.
   The panel found North guilty of three criminal charges _
shredding documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and one count of
aiding and abetting in an obstruction of Congress.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell set June 23 for
sentencing. The illegal gratuity conviction _ accepting a $13,800
security fence for his home _ carries a maximum penalty of two
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The conviction for destroying documents is punishable by a three
year sentence and $250,000 fine. For obstruction of Congress, the
maximum penalty is five years and $250,000. It was unlikely that
the prison terms, if any, would be consecutive.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who had been one of North's chief
defenders in the congressional Iran-Contra hearings two years ago,
was in the courtroom for the verdict. Afterward, he walked up to
North at the defense table and shook his hand. North smiled broadly.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacker, R- Calif., described North as
``absolutely elated.''
   ``We gave each other thumbs up,'' said Rohrabacker, a former
White House aide for whom North campaigned last year. He said the
jury found North guilty ``of only cutting corners and not breaking
the law.''
   North had arrived in the courtroom with his lawyers at 2:20
p.m., about 50 minutes after the judge received a note from the
jury that a verdict had been reached. They had been at their task
for 64 hours, spread over 12 days.
   North, a Marine lieutenant colonel detailed to the National
Security Council, was the key figure in the two-year effort to help
the rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government after Congress
banned official U.S. aid.
   He was involved, too, in arrangements under which the United
States secretly sold arms to Iran and he also helped divert some
profits from those sales to help the Contras.
   Public disclosure of the affair in November 1986 began the worst
crisis of President Reagan's eight-year presidency, a public furor
that didn't subside until after televised congressional hearings
that made North a national figure.
   His lawyers had asked Reagan to testify in his behalf but the
former president refused and the judge upheld his position.
President Bush, too, was subpoenaed and that summons also was
quashed.
   Their names surfaced, however, as the trial spotlighted once
again the bitterness dividing the Reagan administration _ which
wanted to help the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguan
government _ and the Congress which banned such aid between
mid-1984 and mid-1986.
   Documents released during the trial showed Bush may have been
aware of plans to increase U.S. aid to Honduras in exchange for
that country's giving sanctuary to the Contras. They suggested,
too, that he and Reagan were far more deeply involved in the Contra
cause than has been acknowledged before.
   A government ``admission'' described how Reagan, Bush and other
top government officials took part in elaborate efforts to induce
third countries to give military support to the guerrillas in
return for favors and aid from the United States. These were the
so-called ``quid pro quo'' arrangements.
   The charges dealt not with North's clandestine activities on
behalf of the Contras _ at a time when Congress ordered all U.S.
aid withheld _ but with the former National Security Council aide's
attempts to cover up his efforts.
   The jury convicted North of falsifying and destroying documents
in November 1986 as the affair was about to become public, and of
accepting an illegal gratuity _ a $13,800 home security system _
from Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord.
   North also was convicted of aiding and abetting in obstruction
of Congress by falsifying a chronology of events in the affair. The
false chronology stated that no one in the U.S. government knew
until January 1986 that a CIA-assisted shipment from Israel to Iran
in November 1985 contained Hawk missiles.
   He was acquitted of five other charges of lying to or
obstructing Congress, of two counts of lying to then-Attorney
General Edwin Meese III and obstructing Meese's inquiry into the
affair, of converting traveler's checks to his own use and of
conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by using a
tax-exempt foundation to raise funds for the Contras.

   Police said artillery fire from Moslem
west Beirut and north Lebanon tore up Christian beaches Thursday in
violation of a cease-fire sponsored by the Arab League, but no
casualties were reported.
   They said dozens of rockets and howitzer shells landed on
beaches of the besieged 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and
east of Beirut, but the Christians did not return the fire.
   Some shell also crashed in residential areas of Christian east
Beirut, the heart of the Christian enclave.
   The Cypriot ferry Larnaca Rose, making its first voyage to
Lebanon since fighting forced it to stop the journeys April 24, was
ordered by its agents to turn back as the firing escalated after
nighfall. The ferry is one of the few escape methods for Christians
trying to flee the enclave.
   Arab League mediators accused Syria's Moslem allies of violating
the truce declared in the 2-month-old battle between Gen. Michel
Aoun's Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian forces and
Druse militiamen.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate given in 1976, a year after the sectarian
civil war began, and has become the country's main power broker.
Its troops patrol west Beirut.
   League envoys Lakhdar Ibrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, and
Abdel-Aziz Jassem, Kuwait's ambassador to Syria, ended two days of
talks with Christian and Moslem leaders Thursday and drove to
Damascus.
   Ibrahimi, personal envoy of Chedli Klibi, secretary-general of
the Arab League, said before departure: ``We remain fully
optimistic that the truce adopted by the Arab League last week .. .
will be implemented.''
   The truce was proclaimed April 28, but disputes over a clause
about lifting blockades of ports delayed its implementation.
   Moslems say the provision includes illegal harbors run by
militias, which Aoun's forces blockaded March 6.
   His blockade started the artillery battle that has raged since.
Police say 278 people have been killed and 1,010 wounded, nearly
all of them civilians.
   Aoun initially refused to lift the siege. Ibrahimi met
separately Wednesday with Aoun, who heads a Christian Cabinet in
Lebanon's dual government, and acting Premier Salim Hoss, who leads
the Moslem government.
   Lebanon's government split in September when the six-year term
of Amin Gemayel, the Christian president, ended with Parliament
unable to agree on a successor. The army also divided into
Christian and Moslem commands.
   After his meeting with the general, Ibrahimi said the
differences over the ports had been eliminated and declared:
``There's no justification for a single shot to be fired in Lebanon
from now on.''
   Intermittent artillery and rocket fire occurred both Wednesday
night and Thursday, however.
   Jassem, the other envoy, said Thursday: ``The cease-fire is
being violated from west Beirut and not from east Beirut,'' the
city's Christian sector. He spoke to reporters after meeting with
Hassan Khalid, religious leader of Lebanon's Sunni Moslems.
   In Washington, the State Department praised Aoun's decision to
lift the port blockade. ``The United States welcomes the
announcement by Gen. Aoun that he will suspend temporarily his
blockade of the ports,'' said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   In a statement carried by the Voice of Lebanon, a Christian
radio station, Jassem said the Arab League effort was not ``a magic
wand.''
   He and Ibrahimi also conferred with Hoss on Thursday, for the
second time in as many days, and with Sheik Mohammed Mehdi
Shamseddin, the highest-ranking Shiite Moslem clergyman.
   They visited the Soviet and French embassies, said sources close
to the mediators, and met with the U.S. charge d'affaires, Daniel
Simpson.
   Simpson was quoted by the newspaper An-Nahar as saying: ``The
cease-fire ... makes me sleep better and no one gets hurt. I
strongly support it.''
   Ibrahimi said his contacts informed him the United States and
Soviet Union ``support the Arab initiative.''
   The league's peace plan also calls for deployment of Arab
military observers to monitor the truce and oversee reopening of
the harbors and of the Beirut airport, which closed soon after the
shooting started.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle
visited thousands of Cambodian refugees at their remote, dusty camp
Thursday to ``call the attention of the world'' to their plight.
   In a dramatic finale of the Asian leg of his 12-day trip, Quayle
and his wife Marilyn traveled for two hours _ by military transport
plane, helicopter and limousine _ to reach this camp of bamboo and
thatched houses just six miles from the Thai-Cambodian border and
some 250 miles from Bangkok.
   ``Today is to call the attention of the world to what is going
on. These poor kids here, the sick ...,'' he said.
   The refugees ``want to return to their home (in Cambodia) and
yet they can't because of the illegal occupation by Vietnam,'' he
said. He called the plight of Cambodians ``something that has been
overlooked _ it's a tragedy, a human tragedy.''
   Quayle, the highest-ranking American to visit a refugee camp in
Thailand, was given a hero's welcome by villagers, many of whom
have lived at Site B for a decade awaiting word as to when they can
return to Cambodia.
   The dirt road from the camp's entrance to a central square where
Quayle made a brief speech in the broiling sun was lined for nearly
two miles with children waving paper American, Thai and Cambodian
flags.
   ``I hope his visit will help me go home,'' said Vu Thi, a
40-year-old woman who fled Cambodia a decade ago.
   Some 10,000 people, mainly women and children, greeted Quayle,
who frequently leaned over a rope barrier to touch the youngsters,
pat their stomachs or pose for photographs with them.
   Later, Quayle said he found his visit to a medical clinic at the
well-maintained camp ``very depressing.'' He saw mothers sitting on
bamboo beds surrounded by their sick children.
   The vice president used his visit to underscore what has been a
dominant theme of his Australia-Pacific trip: Cambodia's future
once the Vietnamese troops withdraw Sept. 30.
   ``We will continue our support (for the non-communist
resistance) until there is a complete withdrawal ... and a
political settlement,'' Quayle said, looking out on a sea of people
protecting themselves from the sun with umbrellas.
   ``Vietnam, NO,'' and ``U.S.A., Strong Supporter of Cambodia,''
read large banners hoisted by the crowd.
   The camp is run by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the son of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former leader whom Washington wants to
head a transitional government once Vietnamese troops leave.
   Quayle met with Sihanouk in Indonesia, the second Southeast
Asian country he visited.
   Part of Quayle's mission has been to gather information for
President's Bush's policy review on Cambodia. The two will meet for
lunch Friday after the vice president returns to Washington.
   One option is providing military assistance to the non-communist
factions. While Washington would prefer a diplomatic to a military
solution in Cambodia, it is adamant about refusing to permit the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge to dominate any future government.
   The Khmer Rouge were responsible for killing at least 1.5
million people in Cambodia between 1975 and 1978. Cambodia's
current leader, Hun Sen, was installed by Vietnam.
   Security was tight at the camp, where 60,000 people live, with
Secret Service agents in flak jackets wielding assault rifles.
   Quayle had initially planned to tour a larger camp, Site 2, but
the location was changed several days ago because the vice
president's aides thought recent shelling believed to be coming
from Cambodia would place Quayle in too much danger.
   The Site B camp, where Quayle stayed two hours, receives much of
its aid through the U.N. Border Relief Operation.
   Mitchell Carlson, a U.N. worker, said the camp residents have
``very little they can do'' at the camp. He described the place as
``a welfare state,'' with about one-third of the population under
10 years old.
   More than 300,000 Cambodians live in Thai camps, where they are
classified as displaced people and are unable to leave. They are
hoping that Sihanouk's and the other Cambodian factions can arrive
at a solution so they can go home.
   Quayle left Thailand on Thursday, made a refueling stop in Japan
and was heading for Alaska for a brief tour of the cleanup
operations from the March oil spill in Prince William Sound before
returning to Washington.

   Donald J. Trump, a consummate
player in the high-stakes, serious world of big business, visited
the nation's oldest game manufacturer Thursday to herald new
editions of ``Trump The Game.''
   Female workers at the Milton Bradley Co. screeched when he
passed by and one cried when he bussed her on the cheek. ``He
kissed me! He kissed me!'' said a shaky Grace Adams of Springfield,
who has worked 31 years at the company.
   The New York City and Atlantic City, N.J., real estate mogul
flew to the western Massachusetts factory of 2,300 workers in his
black private helicopter to fulfill a promise to the company, which
expects ``Trump The Game'' to be the biggest seller in its 129-year
history, despite its $25 pricetag.
   ``They were intent on having me come up to meet the real
people,'' Trump said. ``These are the people doing the work.''
   Employees clapped at each stop in the 45-minute visit, women
sighed ``Isn't he handsome?'' and men lined up for autographs on
the game money that bears his likeness and comes in denominations
no smaller than $10 million.
   More than 2 million games are scheduled for production by year's
end. It is the No. 1 seller in the 300 stores that have received
advance copies, Milton Bradley President George Ditomassi said.
   Neither the company nor Trump will reveal his royalties from the
game, but both said he is donating proceeds to charities for the
homeless and for research on AIDS, cerebral palsy and multiple
sclerosis.
   The board game is a sophisticated battle in which players first
bid against each other for airlines, casinos, luxury hotels and
other major properties, then try to negotiate deals.
   ``If you don't do well at this game, you should stay on
9-to-5,'' Trump advised, adding that the game is tough even for a
veteran like him.
   But he resisted explaining its appeal. ``If I said it, you'd say
I have a big ego, so why say it?''
   Although several game manufacturers tried to peddle their ideas
to Trump, the one that caught his eye came from an independent
inventor from Chicago who suggested Milton Bradley as a
manufacturer.
   Trump said he settled on the nation's largest board game maker
because ``the loyalty, decisiveness and professionalism of this
company is just unbelievable.''

<HEAD>House Committee Investigates Documents On Deal With Honduras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a spin-off from the trial of Oliver North,
the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday began investigating
why Congress did not get White House documents on a secret deal
with Honduras to aid the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The committee's investigation is in response to a request from
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who was chairman of the House committee
that investigated the Iran-Contra affair in 1987. It is similar to
an investigation being carried out by the Senate Intelligence
Committee.
   Documents that surfaced at the North trial show that President
Reagan approved a deal in which the United States would expedite
economic and military aid to Honduras in return for that country's
continued help for the Contras, who were encamped just inside
Honduras along the border with Nicaragua.
   The documents, together with testimony during North's trial,
suggest that senior officials up to and including Reagan and
then-vice president George Bush were more involved in the affair
than the congressional committees knew.
   The situation has been further clouded by administration
contentions that there was no ``quid pro quo'' deal with Honduras
to aid the Contras, an action that would have been illegal at the
time because of congressional prohibitions.
   Bush himself repeated the assertion Thursday, giving reporters
``the word of the president of the United States'' that ``there was
no quid pro quo'' and promising to turn over to Congress records of
his 1985 meeting with the Honduran president.
   Those assertions conflict directly with the documentary
evidence, which shows there not only was such a plan but that it
apparently was carried out.
   The White House has offered to make available to Congress former
White House counsel Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., who oversaw the
document search for the congressional Iran-Contra committees and
gave assurances that all relevant documents had been provided.
   At the same time, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said he would hold up
U.S. aid to Central America until the Bush administration answers
questions raised by the North trial documents.
   ``I do have an obligation to get those answers before we provide
any additional assistance to the same countries,'' said Obey,
chairman of the House Appropriations foreign operations
subcommittee.
   ``The North documents would seem to lead to some very troubling
conclusions about the use of foreign aid to persuade aid recipients
to provide foreign aid to the Contras at a time when providing aid
to the Contras was against official American government policy,''
Obey said.
   In their request for an investigation, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said a preliminary staff analysis had turned
up four documents released at North's trial which the congressional
investigators never saw.
   In addition, two other documents were missing cover sheets or
notations or were incomplete in other crucial ways, they said.
   One, an April 25, 1985, memo from Robert McFarlane, who at the
time was the national security adviser, recommended that Reagan
telephone Honduran President Roberto Suazo to reassure him of U.S.
backing for the Contras. Missing from the congressional copy is the
notation, ``cc Vice President,'' apparently signaling that George
Bush was sent a copy of the memo.
   Among documents the congressional panels never received were a
Feb. 19, 1985, memo outlining a plan to step up U.S. aid to
Honduras in return for that nation's support of the Contras, and a
memo dated the following day making it clear that the
administration knew it was forbidden from providing aid under those
circumstances.
   Also not turned over to congressional investigators was an Oct.
30, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane about reconnaissance of
Nicaragua and mentioning the air drop of two recoilless rifles to
the rebels.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
challenged the Soviet Union on Thursday to fulfill Mikhail
Gorbachev's promises of reform, saying the administration intends
``to test the application of Soviet `new thinking' again and
again.''
   Baker's outline of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union comes as
he prepares to leave Monday on a five-day trip that includes his
first Moscow meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   It also occurs during a crisis within the NATO alliance as the
United States is struggling with its allies on forging a strategy
to deal with Gorbachev's troop reduction and arms control
initiatives.
   The secretary's remarks _ the result of a long-awaited review of
U.S.-Soviet policy undertaken since President Bush took office more
than three months ago _ were contained in a speech prepared for
delivery to members of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington think tank.
   While applauding such moves such as the withdrawal of troops
from Afghanistan and the agreement banning all U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe, Baker complained
that Soviet behavior still does not square with the slogans of
perestroika.
   The secretary said the United States intends to build on the
progress made in the human rights and arms control arenas, in
particular suggesting a date for the continuation of the strategic
arms talks. The talks dealing with the most dangerous weapons in
the U.S. and Soviet arsenal went into recess late last year.
   But Baker said he intends to go to Moscow to broaden the
U.S.-Soviet agenda, seeking to focus on regional conflicts, the
proliferation of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons and other
issues such as terrorism, the environment and drug abuse.
   ``The president has said, and I have said that we have no wish
to see perestroika fail. To the contrary: we would very much like
it to succeed,'' said Baker. ``... A process that promises to
increase the freedom and improve the well-being of the Soviet
peoples is in everyone's interest.''
   The secretary said it is too early to tell whether Gorbachev's
``new thinking,'' known by the Russian name ``perestroika,'' will
succeed or not.
   And as Baker challenged the Soviets to do more, he offered no
specific U.S. overtures to encourage Soviet concessions.
   ``Unfortunately, there are still many regions where the `new
thinking' has yet to take root. We still see many signs of the old
thoughts and the old actions in Central America, where the Soviets
sent over $500 million in aid to the Sandinistas last year,'' Baker
said.
   He cited Soviet shipments of long-range bombers to Libya's
Moammar Khadafy, Soviet military support of militant North Korea
and the Soviet occupation of Japan's Northern Territories.
   ``At a time when we hear talk of unilateral reductions, of the
need to cut defense spending, and of the necessity to transfer
precious resources from the military economy to the civilian
sector, 3,500 new Soviet tanks continue to roll off the production
lines each year _ a production rate five times greater than our
own,'' Baker said.
   The secretary faulted the Soviets for failing to publish ``a
real defense budget,'' one that would allow an independent
evaluation of Gorbachev's military spending and his pledge to slash
his defense spending by 14 percent.
   He also complained that while there has been talk of a ``common
European home,'' the Berlin Wall still stands and the Brezhnev
Doctrine, which affirms the right to send Soviet troops into other
East European countries, has not been repealed.
   Baker added that the United States does not intend to sit
quietly and await the outcome of Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``Our policy must be to press forward with our agenda, to test
the application of Soviet `new thinking' again and again,'' Baker
said.
   On arms control, Baker suggested the Soviets ``come clean'' in
the conventional force talks going on in Vienna and ``engage in
careful reductions that diminish the threat to the West.''
   Baker said the administration intends to press the Soviets to
make human rights and democratization changes a permanent part of
the Soviet political system and legal code.
   ``By testing Moscow across the board, we have the opportunity to
turn many of the opportunities presented by the `new thinking' into
realities. We can establish frameworks and baselines for common
dialogue in areas where no real dialogue or basis for cooperation
now exists,'' Baker argued.
   The secretary said the administration intends to find out
``whether the `new thinking' is real once we probe beyond the
slogans ... and we can also determine where the old thinking still
holds sway.''

<HEAD>State Department Welcomes Progress in Cambodian Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Thursday praised the
progress made in talks for a political settlement in Cambodia but
said Vietnam must remove its troops for any agreement to work.
   ``We believe the concessions discussed can help achieve a
comprehensive and durable settlement to bring peace and stability
to the Cambodian people,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   The three opposition factions, led by U.S.-backed Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, met in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Tuesday and Wednesday with
the Vietnam-backed government of Cambodia led by Hun Sen. Both
sides agreed progress was made.
   ``The key remains Vietnam's total withdrawal. Hanoi should meet
its September deadline without preconditions, and under
internationally acceptable verification,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
Vietnam has promised to pull its troops out of Cambodia by
September and end a 10-year occupation.
   The State Department reaffirmed its views that once the
Vietnamese withdraw, ``Prince Sihanouk's role as a leader of an
interim coalition preceding elections remains essential.''
   The last comment appeared a response to reports that Sihanouk
told Hun Sen he would consider striking a separate deal with him if
no agreement is reached on inclusion of the Chinese-backed Khmer
Rouge in an interim government.

<HEAD>Bush: No Deal to Abolish Short-Range Atomic Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday he would not
accept any agreement to resolve a crisis in NATO if it would lead
to the abolition of short-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe.
   Rather than curbing nuclear weapons, Bush said NATO should put
its emphasis on trying to get the Soviet Union to reduce its
overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons. He said
negotiations should be conducted outside the public spotlight to
resolve the NATO dispute.
   Against the wishes of the United States and Britain, West
Germany has demanded the opening of negotiations soon with the
Soviet Union to curb short-range nuclear weapons. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl also opposes U.S. and British efforts to more than triple the
range of NATO's Lance missiles to about 250 miles.
   The dispute threatens to rupture the harmony of a NATO summit
May 29-30 that is intended to showcase the strength and unity of
the Western Alliance.
   ``I want the NATO summit to be a success, and we will be working
with the Germans and with others to see that there is a common NATO
position,'' Bush said. ``This is no time for one to compromise or
somebody not to compromise.''
   Bush said, ``I'm always willing to negotiate. But we're not
going to go for any third zero (the elimination of the short-range
weapons) or getting SNF (another term for the weapons) out of whack
in terms of negotiations. So let's get clear on that.''
   The president made his comments in an informal question and
answer session outside the Diplomatic entrance of the White House
after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Canada is circulating a compromise in NATO that calls for
negotiations with the Soviets on short-range nuclear weapons with
the understanding all Lances would not be uprooted and the Warsaw
Pact's edge in conventional forces would be erased. The deal would
permit modernizing the missiles first.
   Mulroney stressed the need for NATO members to stand together,
and credited solidarity and American leadership for the strength of
the alliance.
   ``And so, while there has to be this kind of debate, in the end,
there must be solidarity, total solidarity,'' Mulroney said. ``And
there must be a common view of leadership, which has served the
world so well for 40 years.''
   Referring to NATO, Mulroney said, ``This is not an association
where everybody freelances. We have a common NATO position, and
while there are divergence of views that emerge from time to time,
the object of getting together is to harmonize those views into one
position.''
   Bush said he felt the dispute should be resolved in quiet
negotiations.
   ``There's a lot of public discussion of this issue, and that's
fine,'' Bush said. ``I don't plan in detail to join in on that
public discussion.''
   Bush said the United States had made some proposals to West
Germany and ``I expect we'll be hearing from them soon.'' White
House officials said privately that Bush was not referring to any
new proposal to deal with the problem posed by West Germany's
demands.
   Rather, Bush was referring to a months-old U.S. proposal for an
overall approach for NATO's defense, the officials said.
   On other matters at the news conference, Bush:
   _ Said he will meet ``in the next few days'' with his science
adviser, physicist D. Allan Bromley, about claims of producing
nuclear fusion in a jar of water.
   _ Gave his ``enthusiastic backing'' to demands by Chinese
students who have staged huge pro-democracy demonstrations.
   _ Said he was in the final stages of working on stricter
acid-rain standards that would be part of overall clean air
legislation. For his part, Mulroney said, ``I applaud the leaership
the president is giving to the environment, particularly of the
question of acid rain.''
   _ Warned of unspecified action against Panama if there is fraud
in Sunday's election. ``The world will be looking at them, not just
the United States, in terms of these elections and deciding what to
do if the elections are fraudulent.''

   A Moslem foundation in Saudi Arabia will
finance an Islamic college in Israel, the chairman of an Israeli
Arab group said Thursday.
   Mahmoud Dasoki, chairman of the El Muqassed charity fund, said
the college will be built in the Israeli-Arab town of Taybeh, six
miles southeast of Nazareth.
   Dasoki, whose charity is building the college, said it will be
financed by the Moslem World League, which is based in Mecca.
   The Moslem World League was set up by the late Saudi ruler King
Faisal. It is supported mainly by the Saudi government and sponsors
Islamic projects worldwide.
   The college will teach Islamic law, Dasoki said. Until now,
clergymen in Israel's Arab communities have studied at colleges in
Hebron and Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
   The college will open in a Taybeh mosque this month with 50
students, Dasoki said. He did not say when he expected the new
facilities to be built or how much they would cost.

<HEAD>WASHN: the Contras.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both in the congressional hearings in 1987 and during his
three-month trial, North's defense had been that he had
authorization for everything he did: from two successive bosses,
National Security Advisers Robert F. McFarlane and Poindexter, and
``concurrence'' from the late CIA Director William C. Casey.
   He said he assumed that Reagan _ who spoke out often in support
of the Contra cause _ also knew of his efforts and approved them.
Reagan told the investigative Tower commission two years ago that
he did not know of his NSC staff's efforts to help the Contras.
   North said he had been ``led to believe that everything I was
doing was done at the direction of the president.''
   The jury in North's trial was instructed by Gesell that
``neither the president nor any of the defendant's superiors had
the legal authority to order anyone to violate the law.''
   North was his own chief witness, spending six days on the stand
_ much of it under withering cross examination. He testified that
in November 1986, with the Iran-Contra affair about to be revealed,
he shredded and altered documents on a list McFarlane had prepared.
   On the stand, under the gentle prodding of his lawyer and the
ferocious cross-examination of his prosecutor, North readily
admitted that he altered and shredded documents, and that he lied
to Congress. He said he did it to keep secret what he had been told
was secret.
   ``I was raised to know the difference between right and wrong,''
he testified. ``I knew it wasn't right not to tell the truth on
those things, but I didn't think it was unlawful.''
   The jury of nine women and three men, whose minimum
qualification was that they had not heard or watched North's
televised appearance at the 1987 congressional hearings, had not
given any indication during their long deliberations on what was
holding up a verdict.
   Wearing dark business suits and answering ``yes, sir'' and ``no,
sir,'' the Oliver North in court was far different from the
truculent, combative Marine with six rows of ribbons on his chest,
who aimed his passionate oratory and unflagging patriotism a
nationwide audience of millions in the summer of 1987.
   The story that unfolded in court was a familiar one: North
rallied private support, provided strategy and supplied munitions
to the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government when
Congress, beginning in 1984, banned U.S. military. When Congress
asked in 1985 and 1986 what he and the National Council had been
doing, North admittedly lied _ but said he did it to save lives of
American supporters.
   To a lesser extent, the testimony touched on the secret arms
sales to Iran _ a failed effort to free American hostages held in
Lebanon _ and the funneling of profits from those sales to the
Contras. North was fired by Reagan when the diversion became public
knowledge and fingered by Attorney General Edwin Meese III as``the
only person'' in the U.S. government who knew what was going on.
The same day, however, the president telephoned North to say
``You're a national hero.''
   It appeared, before and during the trial, that the criminal case
against North would founder because the government was unwilling to
allow some of its most deeply-held secrets to be aired in open
court, thus depriving North of a fair trial.
   But Gesell trod the fine line between keeping secrets and fair
trial. He reluctantly allowed four security experts to monitor
testimony and evidence and largely succeeded in avoiding a
stop-and-go ``cuckoo-clock trial,'' he said he didn't want.
   Still to be tried are three others charged along with North:
former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, businessman
Albert Hakim and Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general.
   They had pivotal roles in what North called ``the secret within
the secret'' _ using profits from the Iranian arms sales for the
Contras.
   ``There is no claim that the diversion of money to the Contras
from the sale of arms to elements in Iran is illegal,'' Gesell told
the jury when it received the case on April 20. He told them, too,
that ``it is wholly irrelevant and immaterial in this case whether
or not the president's commitment to aid the Contras was or was not
sound national policy.''
   Reagan made no secret of that commitment and there was testimony
that he said the Contras had to be kept intact ``body and soul''
until Congress restored military aid it cut off via the so-called
Boland Amendment from 1984 to 1986.
   After the verdict, a Contra spokesman said that ``from the
Nicaraguan point of view, we are grateful to Oliver North for all
that he has done in the past for the cause of democratizing
Nicaragua.''
   ``But from the legal point of view, this is a matter of the laws
of the United States, and the sovereign jurors have rendered their
verdict,'' said spokesman Aristides Sanchez.
   North was referred to as the ``action officer'' for central
American affairs within the National Security Council. Vincent
Cannistraro, a high-level CIA official testified that Casey once
decreed that _ with Reagan's approval _ North was ``both the
spokesman and the principal point of reference for sustaining the
Contras.''
   Testimony at North's three-month trial, including his own,
reinforced his image as the ``can-do'' Marine on the National
Security Council staff who supplied the Nicaraguan Contras with
munitions and tactics while U.S. aid was banned, sold arms to Iran
at a profit and used the money for the Contras.
   He was not charged for those acts, but with lying about them
when asked by Congress and Meese to explain his actions and the
NSC's involvement.
   When North was indicted by a grand jury in March 1988, the
charges included two broad counts of conspiracy to defraud the
United States and theft of government property.
   But independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, citing insurmountable
problems created by the mountain of classified information that
would have to be produced, asked that those charges be dropped, and
they were.
   The North trial, delayed by arguments over what national
security secrets could be told, began on Jan. 31. Prosecutors
called 32 witnesses; the defense had 16, including North himself.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of
withholding information from Congress and was sentenced to 200
hours of community service in another courtroom before he testified
at North's trial. Poindexter is scheduled to stand trial later this
year on charges similar to some of those against North.

   President Bush denied emphatically Thursday
that he took part in any scheme to swap U.S. aid for Honduran
assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels, saying he wanted an end to
``needless, mindless speculation'' about his role.
   ``The word of the president of the United States _ George Bush _
is, there was no quid pro quo,'' he declared moments before a
federal jury convicted fired White House aide Oliver North on three
criminal charges in connection with the Iran-Contra affair.
   Speaking of a meeting he had as vice president in the spring of
1985 with then-Honduran President Roberto Suazo, Bush said, ``The
records of the meeting demonstrate there was no quid pro quo.''
   Bush had said several times in recent weeks that he would await
the conclusion of North's trial before considering a definitive
comment on questions that have arisen in connection with that
meeting.
   But on Thursday, standing alongside visiting Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, Bush seemed eager to talk about recently
disclosed documents that placed him at a meeting with Suazo, in
Honduras, at a time when internal Reagan administration memos
suggested a plan to link continuing U.S. aid to Latin American
countries to their willingness to help the Contra rebels.
   The so-called ``findings of fact,'' a 42-page document presented
in the North trial in early April, suggested that Bush as vice
president had played a role as an intermediary in assuring Suazo
that his country's assistance to the Contras would be rewarded with
expedited U.S. financial aid. However, the document did not say
directly that Bush discussed the deal with Suazo.
   It did say that Bush explained to the Hondurans that they were
to receive a great deal more U.S. aid and that that statement was a
part of the purported quid pro quo policy of the administration at
that time.
   The government did not dispute the facts as presented, although
State Department officials subsquently said that the document
presented a distorted picture of U.S. policy and actions in the
region during a period in 1985 and 1986 when the U.S. government
was barred from directly or indirectly aiding the rebels.
   ``Everybody that attended the meeting says that there was no
quid pro quo,'' Bush said Thursday. ``And for those who suggest
there was, the onus is on them,'' he said.
   ``Thank you for asking that question.''
   The president declined to answer specifically when asked whether
he had discussed Contra aid with Suazo. Asked whether he had known
of any quid pro quo arrangements between the U.S. government and
Honduras, he replied, ``not to my knowledge.''
   The president complained that ``there has been much, needless,
mindless, speculation about my word of honor. And I've answered it
now, definitively.''
   This came a little more than a week after Bush told reporters
that ``my conscience is clear'' on the Iran-Contra affair.
   Bush had said last week that he had had no discussions with
anyone about a possible pardon for North, and on Thursday, deputy
press secretary Stephen Hart said only, ``We won't have any
comment'' on North's conviction.
   The former National Security Council staff deputy was acquitted
on nine charges. Bush last year called North a ``national hero,''
but later refined that to say he was alluding to North's record of
heroism in military combat.
   The president also said in an interview with British broadcast
journalist David Frost that he believed that North had ``made
mistakes'' in connection with the arms-to-Iran initiative and the
resulting diversion of money to the Contras, but said he thought
that Americans were sympathetic to North because he had stood up
for what he believed.
   Bush maintained that cables describing his meeting with Suazo
``demonstrate that there was no quid pro quo. ... No implication,
no quid quo pro, direct or indirect from me, to the president of
Honduras, at that meeting.''
   He said that in the aftermath of the North trial, ``I will
``insist that the congressional committees, now that the jury is
in, be briefed thoroughly on the confidential cables (describing
the meeting).''
   ``I can now state declaratively _ without any fear of
contradiction _ that there wasn't (a quid pro quo),'' he said.
   Bush did not say whether he had personally reviewed the cables
that he alluded to in his statements to reporters. Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said recently that Bush had told aides privately
that he was not part of any quid pro quo arrangements with the
Hondurans.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush is
willing to have members of congressional committees briefed by
State Department officials regarding any questions they might have
about the Suazo meeting.
   But he said that Bush would not submit to questions from
lawmakers, although he reiterated that the White House position is
to ``help in any way we can'' in an efforts by lawmakers to learn
about documents that were never seen by the Iran-Contra committees.
   Bush repeated Thursday that he believes the panels should work
with A.B. Culvahouse, White House counsel during the last Reagan
years, to resolve any conflicts about documents provided the
committees.
   ``The position is exactly the same as it's been for the last
three years. We are not investigating ourselves,'' the spokesman
said. ``But we want to cooperate in any way that we can.''

<TEXT>
   The United States and Nicaragua said
Thursday they are about to exchange diplomats again, 10 months
after expelling each other's envoys because of an opposition march
the government ended by force.
   Jose Leon Talavera, deputy foreign minister, said the exchanges
involves diplomats below the rank of ambassador, and replacing
ambassadors will be discussed later.
   ``We don't know the reason for this sudden change of attitude''
by the United States, he said. ``It's probably their famous
carrot-and-stick policy, but this carrot is so small it takes a
magnifying glass to see it.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said seven U.S. diplomats were being sent to Managua, and Nicaragua
would be allowed to post the same number.
   Lois Mervin, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, said it was ``an
administrative move and not a change in policy.''
   Nicaragua expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other
U.S. diplomats last July 11, accusing them of scheming to undermine
the Sandinista government.
   It acted the day after police broke up the opposition March in
Nandaime, 40 miles south of Managua. Scores of people were injured,
including policemen.
   Several embassy diplomats were at the march, but U.S. officials
said they had attended only as ``observers.''
   Washington retaliated by expelling Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann
and seven other Nicaraguan diplomats.
   The expulsions led to a ``visa war.'' Nicaragua began requiring
15 days notice before issuing visas to U.S. diplomats. The United
States stopped sending diplomats and refused visas to Nicaraguan
officials.
   That meant embassy staffers could not be replaced, so both
embassies have been in the hands of junior diplomats.
   Nicaragua's leftist government had offered to end the visa
restrictions on Jan. 20, inauguration day for President Bush.
   Talavera said the United States responded last weekend, telling
Nicaragua it would replace seven officials. He said they were
expected next week.
   This week, Washington ``authorized a number of visas so we could
replace our expelled people,'' Talavera said, adding that Nicaragua
would have four new diplomats at its embassy by the end of May.

   Violence-prone hospital patients can be largely
tamed if health-care workers help identify repetitive troublemakers
and take precautions when they check in, researchers said Thursday.
   One key to the success of any such program is winning the
cooperation of hospital employees, who often are ashamed to report
they have been attacked by a patient, said David J. Drummond, a
psychologist at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland,
Ore.
   ``There's a strong tendency among staff members to feel like
`Gee, I must have done something wrong if this patient hit me,'''
Drummond said in a telephone interview.
   Drummond developed a violence-reduction program at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center and Outpatient Clinic in Portland and
his account was published in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   In his study of 36 patients, the number of reported violent
incidents per visit fell more than 85 percent in the 12 months
following the program's implementation compared with the previous
12 months.
   An editorial in the same issue of the medical journal said the
Portland program seemed to place staff safety ahead of patient
rights, a charge that Drummond denied.
   The program required staff members to report all patient threats
or violence against people or hospital property, as well as
situations requiring police or hospital security.
   The incidents ranged from verbal threats to armed hostage-taking.
   Drummond said it took 2{ years for the hospital's Behavioral
Emergency Committee to develop the reporting forms and to persuade
staffers to use them.
   The committee identified 48 patients _ all men, with an average
age of 44.9 years _ as high risks for violent behavior and
``flagged'' their computerized medical files to alert staffers of
their potential for violence.
   The flags consisted of brief messages such as, ``Patient should
be searched for weapons'' or ``Hospital police should be asked to
stand by until released by examining clinician.''
   ``Because of the flag, a nurse or physician now has the benefit
of others' experience with the patient and may arrange for
appropriate measures before walking into an examination room,''
Drummond wrote.
   ``What we find with many patients tending to be disruptive is
that if you get enough folks together in an examining area, you end
up communicating a message to the patient that we are not going to
tolerate any acting out or disruption while we give you medical
care,'' he said.
   The study period ran from 1986 through 1987, with the flagging
program implemented at the beginning of 1987. Six of the 48
subjects were excluded from the study because they were flagged for
incidents that occurred before 1986 and did not visit the hospital
during the study period. Six others were excluded because their
medical records were not available for review, Drummond said.
   The number of hospital visits by the remaining 36 subjects
decreased 42.2 percent in 1987, to 147 from 254 in 1986. The number
of violent incidents fell by 91.6 percent, to four from 47.
   Dr. Burr Eichelman of Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh, N.C.,
took issue with the program, writing in an editorial that it was
unclear whether the program contained safeguards to prevent
hospital staff members from entering false information into a
patient's file, or to prevent the release to law-enforcement
agencies of confidential information about patient behavior.
   ``We cannot take lightly the potential for abuses of patient
rights in this computer age, even in the name of patient and staff
safety,'' Eichelman wrote.
   Drummond said he was the only person authorized to flag patients
for disruptive behavior and that the confidentiality of patient
files was closely guarded.

<HEAD>Bush: I Support Demands By Chinese Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, in his first public comments
on the massive pro-democracy demonstrations that have rocked China
in recent weeks, gave his ``enthusiastic backing'' to many demands
by the Chinese students.
   But the president, who served as the first U.S. liaison officer
to Beijing when the United States opened relations with China under
President Nixon, declined to specifically criticize the Chinese
government, which has sought to stop the demonstrations.
   ``I have words of encouragement for freedom and democracy,
wherever, and I would like to see progress in China, in the Soviet
Union, and in other systems that have heretofore not been in the
forefront, to put it mildly, of human rights or of democratic
rights. And I wouldn't suggest that, to any leadership of any
country, that they accept every demand by every group.''
   However, the president told a news conference on the White House
lawn that he has reviewed the demands by the hundreds of thousands
of students who have taken to the streets of Beijing and other
Chinese cities.
   ``We can certainly, as the United States, identify with them.''
   Bush mentioned the demand for press freedom and said he forgot
other specific demands, but stated, ``A lot of them had my
enthusiastic backing,in a broad, generic sense, and I would like to
encourage China or the Soviet Union or other totalitarian
countries...to move as quick as they can down democracy's path.''
   Bush said that since he lived in China in 1975, ``I`ve been
pleased with some of the changes in China. It's changed
dramatically.''
   ``But they've got a ways to go and other countries in this
hemisphere have a long ways to go, and countries in Europe have a
long way to go.''
   Bush has spoken often and forcefully in favor of the forces
opposing oppressive regimes in such places as Poland and Nicaragua,
but has been quiet on China.
   Bush's comments came as some 100,000 people occupied Beijing's
Tiananmen Square to mark the 70th anniversary of China's first
student movement.
   The crowd, mostly students, defied police and peacefully
gathered for a festive rally to seek greater freedom, cleaner
government, a free press and official recognition of the new
independent student union that authorities say is illegal.
   Students held much smaller demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing
and Changsha.
   China's communist leaders initially said the student marches
were designed to undermine China's government, but in recent days
has said that the demonstrators are being manipulated by
unspecified people and that most protesting students are patriotic.
   Student activists on Thursday indicated that after six
successful marches in defiance of the government, they indicated
future activity may not center on demonstrations.

<HEAD>Opposition Voiced to Lifting Bell Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to lift court-imposed restrictions
on the seven regional Bell telephone companies drew opposition in a
House committee Thursday from newspaper publishers and other
telephone companies.
   The bill, co-sponsored by Reps. Al Swift, D-Wash., and Tom
Tauke, R-Iowa, would lift restraints imposed when the Bell System
was broken up by a federal consent decree in 1984.
   Those restraints prevent the regional Bell companies from
manufacturing telecommunications equipment and offering information
services such as electronic yellow pages, computer data bases and
home shopping and banking.
   Opening hearings on the legislation and new telecommunications
policy, the telecommunications subcommittee of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee heard opposition to the bill from David E.
Easterly, president of Cox Newspapers who represented the American
Newspaper Publishers Association, and William T. Esrey, president
and chief executive officer of United Telecommunications Inc. and
US Sprint Communications Co.
   Easterly said the Bell companies should remain banned from
providing electronic publishing services because as operators of
the local phone systems, they control the delivery system and have
the ability to harm competitors trying to use it to sell electronic
publishing products.
   ``The phone companies have to be banned from publishing over
their own lines,'' Easterly said.
   ``The potential for abuse is absolutely enormous,'' he said.
   William L. Weiss, chairman and chief executive officer of
Ameritech Corp., one of the local Bell companies, supported the
legislation and said the restriction on information services was
added to the consent decree ``to pacify special interest groups''
who wanted to preserve ``their competitive advantage.''
   Weiss said the real issue in their debate with newspaper
publishers is advertising, as electronic yellow pages would be in
competition with electronic classified ads that some newspapers may
want to offer via home video or computer services.
   ``We'd like to take our own business, yellow pages, and move it
forward with technology,'' Weiss said.

been selected by the magazine since the annual designation began in
1967.
   The $8.3 million facility was cited by the magazine, which has

   Dr. C. Everett Koop, the bearded surgeon
general whose straight talk about smoking, AIDS and abortion made
him a lightning rod for critics from the right and the left, said
Thursday he will resign after seven years as the nation's top
health officer.
   During his tenure, Koop lived up to his reputation as a
tough-minded professional and made what had been a figurehead
position into a pulpit from which he hammered at the ills of
smoking and became the nation's No. 1 promoter of condoms in the
fight against AIDS.
   Something of a celebrity, Koop appeared often on television talk
shows and was easily recognized by his silver beard and the
gold-trimmed uniform of the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public
Health Service, which he usually wore at public events.
   In a brief letter to President Bush delivered Thursday, Koop
said he had told the president in February he would not serve out
his full second term, which ends in November. Koop told Bush he
would leave the job July 13 and retire Oct. 1.
   Bush, writing back to Koop that he accepted the resignation
``with regret,'' praised Koop's ``knowledge, wisdom, conviction and
courage.''
   The president credited Koop with ``tackling some of the toughest
public health issues facing our country'' and said he had been ``a
genuine leader, an example to all Americans, whatever their
profession or responsibility.''
   The secretary of health and human services, Louis Sullivan,
applauded Koop's work, saying he has been ``a voice of honesty,
integrity, compassion and plain good sense.''
   Koop said in his letter to Bush that James Mason, assistant
secretary for health, will name an acting surgeon general once the
office is vacant. The surgeon general heads the 6,000-member
Commissioned Corps of the health service, which is part of the
health department.
   Koop, 72, did not say what he planned to do, but has said in
interviews that he wants to write books and work in television on
health issues. He now earns $91,200, including housing and uniform
allowances.
   Koop could not be reached for comment. His office said he was on
his way to Geneva, Switzerland, for a World Health Organization
meeting.
   President Reagan's 1981 nomination of Koop, then
surgeon-in-chief of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, set
off a bitter, nine-month battle for Senate confirmation.
   A pediatric surgeon with an international reputation, Koop was
strongly opposed by liberals who feared him as an anti-abortion
crusader who lacked experience with public health issues.
   But he turned most of those critics around, many of them when he
issued a no-nonsense report on the AIDS crisis in October 1986 that
advocated the use of condoms and explicit sex education about how
the deadly virus is spread.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of a House health
subcommittee, had voiced deep misgivings when Koop was named
surgeon general, saying, ``Dr. Koop scares me; he is a man of
tremendous intolerance.''
   But on Thursday Waxman said:
   ``One of the great surprises of the last eight years is how
wrong I was. I take a great deal of pleasure in admitting how wrong
I was. If they could find a clone of Koop, they ought to appoint
him.''
   Conservatives at first embraced Koop, a member of an old-line
evangelical Presbyterian church and a board member of several major
anti-abortion groups, but later lost faith. They were especially
angered by the AIDS report and Koop's advocacy of condoms and sex
education, saying the result was to encourage promiscuity among
young people.
   ``The approach he advocated deeply offends the values of many
parents,'' Gary L. Bauer, president of the conservative Family
Research Council and once an aide to Reagan, said Thursday.
   Bauer said Koop's comments occasionally ``caused great chagrin''
among some at the White House, although Bauer said he never knew
Reagan to express any feeling that Koop was out of line.
   Koop has been praised almost universally in the gay community
for putting his personal beliefs aside and looking at AIDS as a
public health problem.
   ``He stood up for what he believed was the right thing to do in
terms of health policy even if it wasn't the right thing to do in
terms of politics,'' said Urvashi Vaid, a spokeswoman for the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Most victims of the fatal
disease have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers.
   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation for
Aids Research, said, Koop's ``intergrity as a public health
official was paramount.''
   Despite his strong opposition to abortion, Koop recently won
support from abortion-rights groups when he declined to issue a
report requested by the White House, saying he could not find
enough scientific evidence to determine whether abortion is
psychologically harmful for women.
   Koop was also on the front line in the fight against smoking, an
area of activity for his predecessors since the first surgeon
general's report on smoking in 1964.
   He called for a ``smoke-free society by the year 2000,''
heightened awareness of the dangers of second-hand smoke and
strengthened warning labels on cigarette packages.
   Koop is the nation's 13th surgeon general, a position that was
created in 1870 as part of the Merchant Marine. Because the post
has little statutory authority, some presidents did not bother to
fill the job. Others gave the title to the assistant secretary of
health.

<HEAD>Nobel Laureate Declined Police Protection After Death Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Naguib Mahfouz, 1988 Nobel Prize winner for
literature, declined police protection after a Moslem
fundamentalist leader called him an apostate and said he should be
killed, his daughter said Thursday.
   The Moslem cleric, or imam, is Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind
sheik who decreed to his followers that it was not a sin to murder
President Anwar Sadat. Sadat was assassinated by Moslem
fundamentalists Oct. 6, 1981, but Abdel-Rahman was acquitted of
murder charges.
   Mahfouz's eldest daughter, Om Kalthoum, said in a telephone
interview that police had offered her father protection after the
death call last month but that he declined it. She added he had not
changed his lifestyle in any way.
   Mahfouz, the first Arab to win the Nobel prize for literature,
was not immediately available for comment.
   Abdel-Rahman, who is under arrest after being charged with
instigating an anti-government demonstration in the southern town
of Fayoum, said in an interview with the Kuwaiti newpaper Al-Anbaa
April 13 that Mahfouz had turned his back on Islam and therefore
should be killed under Islamic laws.
   Abdel-Rahman also said Mahfouz, 77, should have been killed a
long time ago after writing ``Children of Gebelawi,'' which is
banned in Egypt because one of its characters resembles God.
   The interview did not appear in Egypt and had no immediate
impact. But on April 21, Moussa Sabry, a columnist in the daily
Al-Akhbar newspaper, warned security authorities that
Abdel-Rahman's threat was real.
   ``Let me tell you that the life of our great writer is
threatened by assassination, this is a public announcement that he
can be killed,'' Sabry wrote. ``What are the legal and security
measures that should be taken in this case?''
   When an international uproar arose over the novel ``Satanic
Verses'' by Salman Rushdie, under death threats from Iran for
alleged blasphemy, Mahfouz told The Associated Press that freedom
of expression should be protected at all costs.
   He said he had not read Rushdie's book but that anyone who
disagreed with its contents had the right to respond to it in
newspapers or books. He said Iran's death threat was wrong and only
harmed the image of Islam in the world.
   Mahfouz says he is a Moslem, although he does not observe
religious practices diligently.
   Author of more than 40 novels and several collections of short
stories, Mahfouz was the first Arab to win the Nobel prize for
literature. The writer's health is very frail and he was unable to
accept the award personally last December.

<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North left on verdict day just as he
arrived _ through the back door, shoulders squared, eyes fixed dead
ahead, no comment for public consumption. But first there was a
broad smile, and a courtroom kiss for his wife.
   She smiled, too, even as the federal jury of nine women, three
men had pronounced her husband both guilty and innocent, convicting
him on three felony counts, acquitting him on nine others.
   The jury rendered that verdict, on its 12th day of
deliberations, without casting a single glance at the defendant,
the former Vietnam war hero and Marine lieutenant colonel charged
with scheming outside of the law and White House order as the
principal action officer in the Iran-Contra affair.
   North sat impassively as U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
read the verdict, including the findings of guilt _ falsifying and
destroying documents, accepting an illegal gratuity, and aiding and
abetting the obstruction of Congress. Then, after both judge and
jury filed solemnly from the room, North strode to wife Betsy and
they embraced.
   The couple, the North defense team and their bodyguards,
departed from the rear of the building in a gray van, their usual
practice throughout the trial. Reporters were not allowed close
enough to ask questions. Betsy waved at a small group of supporters
hoisting placards and chanting encouragement, but North did not
turn their way.
   ``Ollie, Ollie, Ollie!'' chanted the pro-North group. Their
signs read ``Oliver North, American hero,'' and ``Baseball, Hot
Dogs, Apple Pie and Ollie North.'' One member of the group, Bob
Goulder, said North ``was doing something he belived in for a
cause, which probably not one in 10 people in America do.''
   At the main entrance to the courthouse, chief trial prosecutor
John Keker, himself a former Vietnam hero, declared: ``Col. North
has been convicted of three very serious charges ... The jury has
spoken after a long and difficult trial, and the principle that no
man is above the law has been vindicated.''
   But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a former White House aide
for whom North campaigned last year, said the jury had found North
guilty ``of only cutting corners and not breaking the law.''
   Rohrabacher and Reps. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., and Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., had gone to the courtroom to lend support to North as the
verdict was announced, and met briefly with him afterward. North
was ``absolutely elated,'' and his wife expressed ``a true sense of
relief,'' said Rohrabacher.
   Hyde said ``I am sorry he was found guilty of anything. If the
president had been able to testify and (former National Security
Adviser John) Poindexter had been able to testify, he would have
had a fair trial.''
   ``I consider this a vindication. I considered this a political
trial from day one,'' said Rohrabacher. ``George Bush should end
this travesty and give him a pardon.''
   A hundred reporters and dozens of camera crews were stationed at
the front of the courthouse in hopes of catching North and other
key players in the trial.
   The first person to give that assemblage word of the outcome was
Dornan, R-Calif., who got the verdict wrong _ proclaiming that
North had been convicted of only two counts.
   Speaking as a ``personal friend and admirer of Col. North,''
Dornan said he didn't expect the conviction on the illegal
acceptance of a gratuity _ a security gate _ would hold up on
appeal.
   ``If that one isn't overturned on appeal, I'll eat your
microphones,'' Dornan said.
   The outside world's view of the verdict changed some 10 minutes
later when several dozen reporters scrambled out of the courtroom
itself, many to do instantaneous stand-up reports for television.
   ``Some said our system of justice could not deal fairly, if at
all, with this case,'' Keker said. ``Some even said that it
couldn't be tried.''
   Then, after noting the three felony convictions and proclaiming
vindication of the principle than no man stands above the law,
Keker said ``Thank you very much,'' and walked away, refusing all
questions.
   Soon thereafter, a scream of sirens announced the departure,
with an escort of U.S. marshals, of the jury. They weren't taking
questions, either.

   Here are some of Dr. C. Everett Koop's
accomplishments and controversies during his seven years as surgeon
general:
   _In 1983, Koop helped write regulations designed to protect
handicapped infants by ensuring they be provided nourishment and
care. The regulations were later thrown out by the Supreme Court.
   _On May 20, 1984, Koop declared the nation's No. 1 health goal
to be a ``smoke-free society by the year 2000.''
   _On March 25, 1986, the surgeon general declared snuff and
chewing tobacco to be a ``significant health risk'' that can be
addictive and lead to cancer.
   _On Aug. 1, 1986, Koop put himself at odds with the White House
and endorsed a proposed ban on cigarette advertising in magazines,
newspapers and other publications.
   _On Oct. 22, 1986, Koop issued a report on the AIDS epidemic in
which he said use of condoms for ``safe sex'' was a key weapon in
the fight against the spread of AIDS, and supported sex education
for children as early as the third grade.
   _In a May 1988 report, the surgeon general declared nicotine to
be addictive, like heroin and cocaine, providing new ammunition for
anti-smoking forces.
   _In January 1989, Koop declined to issue a report requested by
the White House because he said there was insufficient scientific
data to determine whether abortion harms women psychologically.

<HEAD>Kennedy Grills Cavazos on Litercy Funds Cutback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after delivering a report critical of
the performance of U.S. high schools, Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos faced sharp questioning from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy about
the Bush administration's elimination of most federal literacy
programs.
   Even before Cavazos could deliver his opening statement to the
Senate Labor and Human Resources education subcommittee, Kennedy, a
Massachusetts Democrat, asked Cavazos to explain why President Bush
has asked for money to fund only one major adult literacy program
in his 1990 budget request.
   ``We have to ask ourselves how much we're really gaining ... if
we are focusing on one program and yet cutting back on others,''
said Kennedy, who heads the labor and human resources panel.
   Cavazos said his department was exercising ``a little bit of
academic deregulation'' and giving the states more flexibility in
using the available money.
   Bush has asked for $192 million in the 1990 education budget for
adult literacy programs. Experts say there are 25 million to 30
million functionally illiterate adults in the United States.
   ``You raised the adult education state grant by $24 million but
other programs are cut by $21 million,'' Kennedy said.
   ``I can't look and read this budget and think that it does very
much in terms of where the administration's commitments are because
it basically is not even a current services program,'' Kennedy
persisted in an exchange after Cavazos delivered his prepared
testimony.
   ``We look at these projects as demonstration projects. And
that's why they are not contained in our budget request for 1990,''
said D. Kay Wright, deputy assistant secretary for vocational and
adult education.
   ``We hope that after two years the states can take a look at
some of these projects and decide that they want to do similar
projects.''
   ``Then the program is effectively eliminated,'' countered
Kennedy.
   ``I think that the effort has to come across from everybody. ...
It is not just a federal problem. It's a problem that really needs
to be dealt with at every level,'' said the secretary.

<HEAD>Kremlin Panel Contradicts Georgian Findings on Toxic Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Kremlin commission probing last month's fatal
clash between troops and protesters in Soviet Georgia found that
three gas grenades exploded in the crowd but that the gas could not
have killed anyone, a government spokesman said Thursday.
   The findings conflicted with unequivocal statements from a
Georgian commission and top Georgian officials that a chemical used
when Soviet troops charged pro-independence protesters on April 9
caused nerve damage and several deaths.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the
Kremlin panel identified one component of the gas as a chemical
known in the West as ``CS,'' an incapacitating agent used to break
up crowds in many countries.
   ``When this gas is used in the open air, any fatality is ruled
out,'' Gerasimov told a government news briefing.
   Preliminary findings from a Georgian commission appointed days
after the clash in the Soviet republic's capital of Tbilisi held
that many protesters suffered from ``poisoning by an unknown
chemical substance'' with effects resembling a nerve toxin.
   Georgian Communist Party Chief Givi Gumbaridze told foreign
correspondents in Tbilisi last week that some of the 20 deaths
during the April 9 ethnic unrest were caused by gas.
   Almost 500 Georgians have been treated for chemical poisoning,
and many are still hospitalized with symptoms affecting their
nervous system, vision, respiration and internal organs, the weekly
Moscow News reported.
   ``The victims can only be helped by exact information about the
formula of the chemical substance and its antidote, which are still
unknown to Tbilisi doctors,'' the weekly said in its latest
editions.
   Five more young people have joined eight others who began a
hunger strike on Friday to demand that the military provide an
antidote to the gas, a Georgian activist, David Nadiradze, said
Thursday.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a speech last week to a
plenary meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee, promised a thorough investigation of ``everything that
happened'' in Georgia.
   The six-man Kremlin panel consists of top officials of the KGB,
the Georgian Council of Ministers and the Soviet ministries of
health, defense and internal affairs. Its chairman is Georgy S.
Tarazevich, president of the republic of Byelorussia.
   Its investigation is meant to run parallel to work done by the
Georgian panel.
   The 45-member group based in Georgia originally consisted mainly
of government officials, including Georgian President Zurab
Chkheidze, who later resigned along with other republican leaders
who took responsibility for the decision to send in government
troops to disperse the protesters.
   After many Georgians complained that the panel could not be
objective because officials were called upon to investigate their
own actions, the group was made off-limits to representatives of
government agencies involved in the clash.
   It is now considered an independent citizens' group.
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov, space scientist Roald
Sagdeev and historian Dmitry Likhachev, all members of a new
national parliament, have also been accepted as members, the Moscow
News reported.
   The Georgian commission already has managed to disprove rumors
that the bodies of some people who have been missing since the
clash had been hidden in hospital morgues, the Moscow News said.
But the search for several people who have still not been accounted
for continues, it said.

   California's Supreme Court on Thursday
unanimously upheld all of Proposition 103's long-term restrictions
on insurance rates and practices, but it punched a hole in a 20
percent rate rollback and freeze.
   The ruling by the conservative-dominated court still was a
serious blow to insurance companies, who had predicted that
Proposition 103 would cost them $4 billion a year.
   Those costs may drop in the short run because of the court's
weakening of the rate rollback, the most dramatic immediate change
proposed by Proposition 103. But the provisions upheld by the
justices are potentially much more sweeping in the long run.
   They include a restriction on territorial rate-setting by auto
insurers; a 20 percent insurance discount for ``good drivers,''
defined as those with no more than one moving violation in three
years; a requirement of advance state approval for insurance rate
increases after this November; and election instead of appointment
of the state insurance commissioner, starting next year.
   Until this November, insurers will be allowed to increase rates
without prior state approval. But any amount that state Insurance
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie rules to be excessive, when measured
against a standard of a ``fair rate of return,'' will have to be
refunded, with interest.
   The overall ruling is ``a major, unprecedented victory for
citizens, consumers and democracy,'' said Harvey Rosenfield, the
Los Angeles lawyer and consumer activist who drafted Proposition
103 and engineered its passage last November against heavily
financed opposition.
   Insurers could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review their claims
that the rate limitations and restrictions on non-renewal of
policies violate their property rights.
   The industry's first response to the ruling was cautious.
   ``There seems to be a lot of gray area in the decision,'' said
Richard Wiebe, spokesman for the Alliance of American Insurers.
``On first reading, it appears that there are safeguards that would
allow companies some relief from the rate rollbacks.
   ``But clearly it's a new day for insurance regulation in
California and we intend to work with the insurance commissioner,
Legislature, and consumer groups.''
   Insurance companies already have gone to the Legislature to seek
passage of a milder form of a no-fault auto insurance plan that was
one of four insurance-related measures rejected by the voters last
November.
   Insurers spent over $55 million in the election campaign, and
trial lawyers, who backed a rate-regulation measure that was more
modest than Proposition 103, spent over $16 million. Proposition
103, whose backers included consumer advocate Ralph Nader, had a $3
million budget.
   Major insurance companies sued the day after the Nov. 8 election.
   As written, Proposition 103 required auto, property and
liability insurance rates to be reduced 20 percent below November
1987 levels and frozen until November 1989 unless an insurer could
show a ``substantial threat of insolvency.''
   Insurers said the exemption was too narrow to allow them a
``fair rate of return,'' a constitutional standard set by the court
in rent-control cases. The court's opinion by Justice Alan
Broussard agreed, rejecting arguments by defenders of the
initiative that a recent surge in insurance rates justified a
temporarily stricter standard.
   ``The asserted rise in insurance rates, rendering insurance
unavailable or unaffordable to many, is not a temporary problem; it
is a long-term, chronic situation which will not be solved by
compelling insurers to sell at less than a fair return for a
year,'' Broussard said.
   ``Over the long term the state must permit insurers a fair
return; we do not perceive any short-term conditions that would
require depriving them of a fair return.''
   After this November, Proposition 103 requires an insurer to
submit any rate increase in advance to the insurance commissioner,
who will decide if it is ``excessive, inadequate or unfairly
discriminatory.'' The court left that provision intact.
   The effect is to leave short-term rate increases largely up to
Gillespie, an appointee of Gov. George Deukmejian and former
insurance executive who has been critical of Proposition 103 but
has been active recently in enforcing some of its provisions.
Backers of the measure predict that an elected insurance
commissioner will take a tougher line on insurers.

   Bush autographed the ball at a White House ceremony with Hall of
Fame President Ed Stack, baseball legend Stan Musial, Musial's

   ``We had a good time talking baseball,'' Boehlert said

the autograph of Richard Nixon, Boehlert said.
   Boehlert, a baseball fan and half-owner of the minor league

<HEAD>US Negotiator Says Europe Must Reform Farm Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man President Bush has picked to negotiate
trade treaties for the United States said Thursday that 12 European
governments must reform the way they subsidize their agricultural
exports.
   Rufus H. Yerxa commented at Senate confirmation hearings held on
his nomination to become deputy U.S. trade representative.
   If confirmed by the Senate Finance Committee, Yerza will be the
chief U.S. negotiator in Geneva, Switzerland, where about 100
countries hope to complete trade agreements in the ``Uruguay
round'' of negotiations by the end of 1990.
   Agricultural exports will likely play a key role in the talks.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said he had spoken last week in
Brussels, Belgium, with Ray MacSharry of Ireland, who is in charge
of agriculture for the European Commission, which handles trade for
its 12 member governments. Their European Economic Community is the
main competitor of the United States in worldwide sales of farm
products.
   The 12 European governments subsidize agricultural exports
through the community's Common Agricultural Policy. The Bush
administration opposes the subsidies, contending they put American
exports at a competitive disadvantage on the world market.
   ``The Common Agricultural Policy is one of the most distorting,
if not the most distorting, elements in agricultural trade,'' Yerxa
said. ``There will have to be a fundamental reform in it.''
   He said the United States had not yet seen what he called ``the
color of the Europeans' money'' _ that is, firm European bargaining
proposals _ on farm export subsidies.

<HEAD>Conference on Ozone Adjourns to Resolve Funding Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A world conference on protecting the
earth's ozone layer adjourned abruptly Thursday for a private
meeting of leaders who disagree on how to help Third World
countries replace environmentally dangerous equipment.
   Earlier, the conference agreed to safeguard company secrets on
the production of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and
called for the elimination of CFCs by the end of the century.
   CFCs are used in refrigerators, air conditioners, housing
insulation, food packaging and furniture, and to clean metals and
tiny computer components.
   Emissions of the chemicals are breaking down the ozone shield,
which filters out the sun's ultraviolet rays, increasing the risk
of skin cancer, eye diseases and hazards to marine and plant life,
scientists say.
   Developing countries argued they cannot afford to replace
appliances they imported or were given in aid by industrial
nations, and the conference agreed a mechanism should be found to
help the Third World phase out such equipment.
   But industrial nations objected to proposals to set up a world
climate fund, prefering to work through bilateral aid rather than
relinquish direct control over the money they donate, delegates
said.
   U.S. delegate Stephen Seidel said an international fund could
create a bureaucracy whose administration costs would divert money
earmarked for aid. Britain, Japan and Canada were among others
opposing the fund.
   Mostafa K. Tolba, head of the U.N. Environment Program
sponsoring the conference of more than 80 nations, adjourned the
plenum for private consultations to work for a consensus.
   Tolba summoned representatives from the United States, the
European Economic Community, China, Mexico and from the Group of 77
developing countries.
   An environment program spokesman said no announcement was
expected until Friday, the last day of the four-day meeting.
   The conference was reviewing the 1987 Montreal Protocol,
ratified by 36 countries, which set out a timetable for slashing
CFC production. The conference resolved on Tuesday to accelerate
the timetable.
   At a closed-door session, the corporate secrecy issue caused a
fiery debate when the Greenpeace environmentalist group demanded
full disclosure of information submitted to the U.N. group on
production of the chemicals.
   The conference adopted a U.S.-European Economic Community
proposal to allow publication of total production figures, but the
environmental group cannot issue a breakdown of the figures by
country and by the chemicals each produces, said U.S. delegation
leader Eileen Claussen.
   ``It's a fair compromise,'' said Ms. Claussen, who is deputy
director of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Greenpeace delegate Karen Coulter said the secrecy could help
countries hide the production of banned chemicals. ``How is it that
commercial confidentiality can override environmental concern?''
she asked.
   Greenpeace's objections were supported by the Soviet Union,
Norway and representatives of the Third World countries, the
Finnish news agency reported.
   The resolutions adopted by concensus at the conference have no
immediate legal standing. They will be part of a summary report
prepared for a meeting next year which will amend the Montreal
treaty.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Congressman Propose Bill To Settle Chippewa Fishing Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wisconsin's congressional delegation
introduced legislation Thursday that would revise the terms of
150-year-old Indian treaties to allow more sport fishing in the
Chippewa area of the state.
   ``The bill adapts the treaties to today's world,'' said Sen.
Robert Kasten, R-Wis.
   Many fear the dispute pitting northern Wisconsin resort owners
and sportsmen against the Indians, who have federal court approval
to begin spear fishing before fishing season opens, will turn
violent.
   Kasten and three of the state's congressmen said they were
working with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson to restart stalled
negotiations between the Chippewas and the state.
   ``A large part of what we are trying to do is get both parties
back to the negotiating table,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. ``The
issue is whether everyone can get along.''
   Obey said he called every tribe in his district to tell them
about the legislation and ask them to cease spearing. He said the
tribes are spearing more fish than they need to feed their families
and should be willing to share with hook-and-line sportsmen.
   Kasten said he was concerned about possible confrontations
between the Indians and fishermen who say the Chippewas are robbing
the lakes of trophy size fish.
   The dispute stems from a federal court decision two years ago
that the Chippewas, under treaties negotiated in 1837 and 1842,
were guaranteed fishing rights in the territories they gave up to
the government.
   ``When the treaties were signed, Wisconsin was a wilderness,''
said Obey. ``The court opinion that caused the problem was off
base.''
   He and the others conceded that their proposed legislation may
be difficult to push through Congress.
   The bill limits the Chippewa tribes' share of the fish from any
Wisconsin lake to 10 percent of the safe harvest level, which means
the tribes would be limited primarily to ceremonial spearing, said
the congressmen.
   The legislation would allow the Indians to go to court to seek
compensation for the amount of fish they would no longer be allowed
to spear. State and federal governments would pay the costs.

<HEAD>Radical Jewish Group Threatens French Premier with Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A telephone caller said a radical Jewish
underground group pronounced a death sentence on the French foreign
minister Thursday for meeting with PLO chief Yasser Arafat, Israel
radio reported.
   It said the anonymous informant claimed to speak for a group
called the Sicarites, which claimed responsibility for a
submachine-gun attack April 10 in Arab east Jerusalem that killed
one Palestinian and wounded three. The assailant, clad in an army
uniform, escaped on foot and has not been caught.
   According to the radio, the caller said a Sicarite court
sentenced Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, to death for meeting
the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman on Tuesday during
Arafat's official visit to France.
   Dumas said Thursday he expected to visit Israel soon to discuss
Middle East peace prospects, but gave no indication of a date.
   The caller, who also telephoned several newspapers and the
national news agency Itim, said the Sicarites uprooted a tree
Thursday that Dumas planted in honor of his father at the Yad
Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem.
   ``A man who shook the hand of Arafat is not allowed to desecrate
the soil of Yad Vashem in the land of Israel,'' the radio quoted
the caller as saying.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sanduri confirmed the tree honoring George
Dumas had been torn out for the second time in three months. The
foreign minister planted it during a visit to Israel in January and
it was first uprooted Feb. 2.
   Yad Vashem spokesman Menachem Fogel said: ``I think this is
stupid. ``George Dumas saved Jews and has paid with his life for
that. He has nothing to do with the deeds of his son.''
   George Dumas was a French resistance leader who saved Jews in
Limoges and was executed by the Nazis in March 1944. The Yad Vashem
institution lists him among the ``Righteous Among the Nations,'' a
title reserved for people who saved Jews from the Nazi Holocaust.
   The Sicarites are named for assassins in ancient Israel who
killed collaborators with Rome. The group also has claimed
responsibility for several arson attacks on apartments and cars of
Israelis with liberal views toward the Palestinians.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski proposed
Thursday that Parliament pass a blanket pardon for political
offenses committed since the original agreements of August 1980
that legalized Solidarity.
   Gen. Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief, made the
conciliatory gesture toward the opposition in a speech opening a
two-day party conference on plans for partially democratic
elections to be held in June.
   New agreements concluded April 5 made the independent union
legal again, after a seven-year ban, in exchange for opposition
participation in the elections.
   Jaruzelski said Thursday the arrangement was a step toward
national harmony and declared:
   ``We think it purposeful to file ... a bill on pardoning and
committing to oblivion breaches of law that were politically
motivated or related to strikes or protest actions after the August
1980 agreements. We hope this initiative will contribute to
strengthening responsible democracy.''
   One of Solidarity's main demands in negotiations for the April 5
accords was an end to such penalties.
   A union spokesman said it would have no immediate comment on
Jaruzelski's proposal.
   Jan Bisztyga, spokesman for the party Central Committee, told
reporters a bill to pardon political offenders would be introduced
``soon'' but that he could not provide copies.
   In his speech, Jaruzelski also said the party is committed to
political reform and recognizes that ``constructive, realistic
opposition is a natural consequence'' of democracy.
   ``We are ahead of the major part of the opposition, which seems
to be taking a nap, because it still sees us in the old, so-called
non-reformable edition,'' he said.
   Jaruzelski said the April agreements were reached after ``a long
and bumpy road. The necessary time had to pass, emotions had to
ease and seeds of trust had to appear. It is all still fragile, but
it is awakening hopes.
   ``In any case, we are treating the cause of national accord with
utmost seriousness,'' he said. ``Constructive, realistic opposition
is a natural consequence of broadening the democratic foundations
of our state system.''
   Under the agreements, the opposition may contest 161 seats, or
35 percent of the total in the Sejm, the existing unicameral
parliament. A 100-member Senate is to be established, chosen by
fully democratic elections.
   The Sejm and Senate together will form the National Assembly,
which will elect a president. The presidency is a new office and
Jaruzelski is expected to fill it.

   American engineers, builders, suppliers and
development experts have an opportunity to earn some of the
trillions of yen Japan plans to pour into overseas economic aid,
U.S. aid chief Alan Woods said Thursday.
   Japan, about to replace the United States as the world's largest
foreign aid donor, is interested in making use of U.S. expertise,
said Woods, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   Britain has already responded to the Japanese desire for expert
collaboration and ``the British have become procurement agents for
the Japanese aid agency throughout East Africa,'' he said.
   Japan plans to spend $50 billion on overseas economic aid in the
next five years, with the emphasis on building dams, power
stations, roads, railways, and factories, AID officials said.
American aid in recent years has shifted from such major capital
projects to technical assistance, they said.
   Foreign firms are already increasing their share of contracts in
the Japanese aid program, but the U.S. share is dropping, strongly
suggesting ``that the competitive environment has become more
favorable but that potential America bidders are not widely aware
of it,'' an AID announcement said.
   Woods announced that AID is sponsoring conferences in San
Francisco on May 10-ll and Orlando, Fla., on May 15-16 to help
American enterprises learn about opportunities in the Japanese
overseas development program. Officials from three Japanese aid
agencies will participate in both meetings, the first such sessions
ever held, he said.
   The Japanese have only about 200 foreign aid specialists and
appear eager to draw on the experience of more than 2,000 Americans
working on AID programs, Woods said.
   There is no formal agreement on collaboration between the two
countries' agencies, Woods said.
   But foreign participation in Japanese-financed programs outside
Japan is governed by conditions different from those for Japanese
domestic projects, where difficult negotiations were held last year
to gain access for U.S. contractors, he added.
   Japanese aid has thus far chiefly been sent to other Asian
nations.

<TEXT>
   Retired Army Gen. William C. Westmoreland
urged Congress on Thursday to toughen the Pentagon's standards of
accounting for missing American soldiers and give families more
input into decisions to classify soldiers as dead or missing.
   Westmoreland, who was U.S. military commander in Vietnam from
1964 to 1968, said many families of the 2,364 Americans not
accounted for since the Vietnam War are ``plagued by the
uncertainty of (the fate of) loved ones.''
   Westmoreland and retired Navy Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt, commander of
the U.S. naval forces in Vietnam from 1968 to 1970, endorsed
legislation by Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., to revamp the
government's accounting system for missing soldiers.
   Rowland, speaking at a news conference, complained that all but
one of the unaccounted-for Americans in Southeast Asia have over
the years had their official status changed from missing or
prisoners of war to killed in action ``regardless of individual
circumstances surrounding the disappearance.
   ``Our government has declared POWs and MIAs as dead based solely
on the passage of time. This is wrong,'' said Rowland. ``Our
interest is that we don't arbitrarily assume people are dead.''
   The Missing Service Personnel Act of 1989 would set up special
three-member panels to investigate cases, and prohibit
killed-in-action classifications based exclusively on the passage
of time.
   The bill would require that at least 50 years had passed or that
no evidence exists that ``reasonably suggests that such a person is
alive'' before classifying a soldier as dead. In addition, U.S.
officials would be required to attempt to search the area where the
soldier was last seen and try to review records of the foreign
government.
   The measure would not automatically reverse classifications from
dead to missing, but families would be allowed to request a review
by the board. Families also would have the right to challenge a
classification in federal court.
   ``There aren't many ways we have to say thank you to the men and
women who served in an unpopular war. Certainly this is the least
we can do,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill.
   Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., said the killed-in-action
classifications represent ``a strange inconsistency'' in government
policy, since the Defense Intelligence Agency continues to actively
investigate reports of missing soldiers.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider said Defense Department officials had
not seen the bill and would withhold comment.
   Several veterans groups supported the measure, but the National
League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast
Asia criticized the legislation.
   League spokeswoman Betsy Cox said while the current system has
problems, Rowland's proposal could result in keeping many cases in
``limbo status.''

   The jury's verdict against Oliver North on
Thursday left supporters claiming he had been all but vindicated
and detractors asserting that it reaffirmed the findings of the
congressional Iran-Contra committees that North displayed disdain
for both law and Constitution.
   North was described by his defenders as ``absolutely elated''
that the jury had acquitted him guilty on nine counts, convicting
him on only three.
   Several members of Congress, all Republicans, called on
President Bush to quickly pardon the former Marine Corps lieutenant
colonel.
   Former President Reagan, on whose watch North took the actions
that resulted in the Iran-Contra scandal and his trial by jury,
declined comment. A spokesman said it would not be appropriate for
Reagan to do so ``because of the likelihood of further legal
proceedings.'' President Bush also had no comment on the verdict.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate's president pro tem,
read off the three guilty verdicts on the chamber's floor, then
congratulated the jury for its diligence.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, the chairman of the Senate
Iran-Contra Committee, issued a statement quoting the panel's
finding that North and the others involved in the Iran-Contra
affair ``showed disdain for our laws and constitutional system of
government.''
   The report concluded that: ``They ran a government outside the
government. They conducted a secret foreign policy and concealed it
through a concerted campaign of dishonesty and deception. And when
the affair began to unravel, they attempted to cover it up with
their deeds.''
   ``The verdict issued today ... reaffirms the conclusions of the
committee,'' Inouye said.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contra
committee, said he was neither elated nor disappointed at the
verdict. ``Col. North had a fair trial ... The system has worked,''
he said.
   ``I have had a good deal of sympathy for Col. North and the
position he was in,'' Hamilton added. ``The fact that Col. North
was in a difficult position does not absolve him of his
responsibility, but it may go toward mitigation of his punishment.''
   ``We certainly didn't find out all the truth in the Iran-Contra
hearings,'' Hamilton said. ``We'll be learning bits and pieces
about Iran-Contra for years to come, and after the statute of
limitations runs out we'll probably find more.''
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., vice chairman of the Senate panel,
said he believed justice was served in the North verdict.
   ``North had to pay a price for his zealotry. ... I found him a
very tragic figure. He did some things that in America today you
have to be held accountable for.''
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who used his position as a member
of the Iran-Contra panel to defend President Reagan and North,
sharply disagreed.
   ``There have been nine acquittals,'' he said. ``If you look at
this objectively, Oliver North has been largely acquitted.''
   ``The jury did not think he was as guilty as did the many
members of Congress who have been ready to hang him,'' Hatch said.
   Hatch added: ``I think George Bush should pardon him. The
president's problem is that if he does, there will be screaming and
shouting by the same partisans.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who also served on the Iran-Contra
committee, said he felt ``sorrow, disappointment'' with the
verdict, ``but not surprise.''
   ``I'm not sure Oliver North got a fair trial. The jury claimed
they never had heard of Iran-Contra but it had consumed all of the
media in Washington. I wonder if it was jury of his peers,'' Hyde
said.
   The Illinois Republican said if Reagan, the late CIA director
Bill Casey and former national security adviser John Poindexter had
been available to assist North, it ``would have been of great
help.''
   ``Colonel North was left twisting in the wind by an
administration he served with all his heart and soul,'' said Hyde,
who believes that Reagan should have pardoned North or testified in
his behalf.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., a member of the Iran-Contra
committee, told reporters: ``I have said from the beginning that
Col. North was acting on orders, expressed or implied. An operation
of the magnitude of the Iran-Contra affair is not one that can be
run solely by one lieutenant colonel out of the basement of the
White House without the knowledge of his superiors.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, a former judge,
said only that ``I respect the jury's verdict in the North case.''
   Outside the federal courthouse here, Rep. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif., an ardent North supporter, said the former Marine's wife,
Betsy, was ``all smiles'' at the verdict.
   He said North smiled as the verdict came in, then turned to kiss
his wife.
   Dornan said North and his wife ``looked like 900 pounds of a
1,200-pound weight had been lifted from their backs.''
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a former White House aide for
whom North campaigned last year, described the defendant as
``absolutely elated.''
   He said that as far as he was concerned the jury found North
guilty ``of only cutting corners and not breaking the law.''
   ``I think George Bush should end this travesty and give him a
pardon,'' said Rohrabacher.
   John W. Keker, the lead prosecutor in the case, told reporters
North was convicted of ``three very serious felony charges.''
   ``The principle that no man is above the law has been
vindicated,'' said Keker who refused to answer questions about the
verdict.
   In a statement, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said, ``It
has been a well-conducted, hard-fought trial. The rule of law has
been discharged.''
   But Richard A. Viguerie, chiarman of the United Conservatives of
America, said: ``Oliver North deserves a medal, not a prison
sentence.'' He predicted `` an avalanche of conservative outcry for
President Bush to pardon Ollie.''
   But Arthur J. Kropp, of the liberal People for the American Way,
said the central lession of the Iran-Contra episode ``is that
governmental deception and excessive secrecy are invitations to
scandal.''
   ``I hope the events of the past few weeks will lay to rest the
question of whether Oliver North is ``a national hero.'''

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson paid James Brown a
belated 56th birthday visit in prison Thursday, and later asked
that the soul music legend be allowed to give a television
interview to the French government.
   ``James Brown's musical contribution has earned him that
honor,'' Jackson said after meeting with Brown for an hour and 40
minutes at the State Park Correctional Center.
   Brown is serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault and
failing to stop for police during a chase across the Georgia-South
Carolina border on Sept. 26.
   The French Ministry of Culture asked for the interview through
Los Angeles record producer Quincy Jones as part of France's
bicentennial celebration. Quincy in turn asked Jackson for help.
Jackson forwarded the request to Gov. Carroll Campbell and
corrections officials.
   Campbell has no authority in such matters, and deferred to the
corrections department, said a Campbell spokesman, Tucker Eskew.
   The commissioner of the South Carolina Department of
Corrections, Parker Evatt, was out of town and would not hear the
request until Monday, said corrections spokesman Bennish Brown, who
is not related to the singer.
   Brown, the self-proclaimed ``Godfather of Soul,'' did not have
any visitors on his birthday Wednesday, the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Official Cites Increased Accident Risk At Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The risk of serious safety lapses at a
Sacramento, Calif., nuclear plant is increasing with the approach
of a local referendum on whether to close the troubled plant, a
city utility official told a Senate panel on Thursday.
   ``The potential for employees to be pressured to keep the plant
operating even during adverse circumstances is high,'' said Ed
Smeloff, a member of the board of directors of the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District, owner of the Rancho Seco plant.
   Residents in the utility district are scheduled to vote June 6
on whether the plant should be closed permanently.
   Smeloff's remarks were disputed in later testimony by Lando W.
Zech Jr., chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has
spent more time over the last three years inspecting Rancho Seco
than any of the 109 other U.S. nuclear reactors.
   ``The stressful environment for Rancho Seco workers has not
resulted in unsafe nuclear plant operations and the commission
concludes that Rancho Seco has been, and can continue to be,
operated safely,'' Zech told a Senate Environment and Public Works
subcomittee that is investigating NRC oversight of Rancho Seco.
   The plant has come under increased scrutiny since an
industry-sponsored safety group, the Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations, issued a report April 4 that sharply criticized the
plant's performance record and the utility district's management.
   The institute's president, Zack T. Pate, told the subcommittee
his group is still concerned about the terms of the June
referendum. The utility agreed last summer that if it failed during
an 18-month trial period starting last June, to operate at a
minimum of 40 percent of capacity, it would shut permanently.
   Smeloff said that since last December the plant has operated at
less than 40 percent of capacity. The average performance rating
for all U.S. nuclear plants is about 60 percent.
   Pate said pressure to meet the 40 percent target could cause
some plant workers to discard normal caution in order to save the
plant, and thus their jobs.

<HEAD>Senators Say Medicare Payment System Hurts Rural Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The health care system in rural America will
crumble if a Medicare reimbursement system that has caused the
``slow starvation'' of rural hospitals isn't quickly reversed, Sen.
Tom Harkin told a Senate panel Thursday.
   Members of the Senate Finance Committee agreed Medicare's system
for reimbursing urban hospitals at a higher rate than their rural
counterparts is unfair and largely responsible for putting rural
hospitals on frail financial footing.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan,
meanwhile, has recommended rural and large urban hospitals receive
greater Medicare payment increases next fiscal year than hospitals
in urban areas with populations below one million.
   Sullivan said he ``recognizes the need to make Medicare's
payment system fairer.'' Under his plan, inflation-based increases
would be greatest for rural hospitals, followed by a slighter
increase for large urban hospitals, and the smallest increase for
other urban hospitals.
   He also suggests more rural hospitals be allowed to qualify as
``sole community hospitals,'' which would allow them to receive
higher Medicare payments.
   A Senate Committee staff member called the proposal
``encouraging but modest, and no replacement for needed
legislation.'' Federal health care officials said the
recommendations would not save deeply troubled hospitals, but would
help equalize profit margins between rural and urban hospitals.
   Since 1980, 206 rural hospitals nationwide have closed and
another 500 are in serious financial trouble, said Harkin, D-Iowa,
a member of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.
   ``This is a critically important issue,'' said Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``Every American ought to have access to
medical care regardless of where we live.''
   Minority Leader Bob Dole and Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, have introduced legislation that calls for
phasing in a uniform Medicare reimbursement rate beginning in 1991.
   ``If we don't act quickly to change Medicare's Prospective
Payment System, the health care system in rural America will
crumble,'' Harkin said. ``If that happens, we will be forced not
very long from now to take drastic measures _ with a drastic price
tag _ to rebuild it.''
   Under the prospective payment system, hospitals are reimbursed
for the average costs of their elderly Medicare patients and not on
actual costs. The system, enacted by Congress in 1983, has meant
rural hospitals are reimbursed by as much as 40 percent less than
urban hospitals, according to testimony.
   The prospective payment system had assumed rural hospitals would
have lower average costs than city hospitals.
   ``We made a wrong calculation,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark.,
who called on Congress to change the formula.
   Pryor said 83 percent of hospitals losing money are rural
hospitals. Dole argued rural hospitals are vital to a community's
very survival.
   ``Many rural occupations are hazardous _ farming, mining, and
timber are among the most dangerous in the nation,'' Harkin said.
``Across the country, rural areas show higher rates of maternal and
infant mortality, chronic illness and disability, and higher
morbidity related to diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, heart
disease, stroke and lung disease than urban areas.''

<HEAD>Compromise Urged on Mexican Debt Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The architect of the Bush administration's
Third World debt plan urged Mexico and U.S. commercial banks on
Thursday to speed up their talks on reducing Mexico's debt burden
and implied that both sides would have to shift their positions.
   ``We are going to press all parties ... to move quickly,'' David
C. Mulford, Treasury undersecretary-designate for international
affairs, told the Senate Finance Committee.
   Asked by Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., whether the banks holding
Mexico's debt should be more willing to bend, he said, ``I have no
doubt the position taken by the banks is their first visible
negotiating position.''
   However, he added, ``It takes two to tango in that case'' and
said Mexico should make proposals that ``are seen as realistic.''
   Mulford is the chief architect of President Bush's new
initiative to relieve the crushing, $1.2 trillion debt burden on
developing countries, particularly in Latin America.
   Bush's Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, is calling on
banks, assisted by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,
to forgive a portion of the debt _ a shift from the Reagan
administration's policy of adamantly opposing any broad-based debt
reduction plan.
   As one of the first tests of the new strategy, representatives
of large banks and Mexico have been meeting in New York to discuss
Mexico's proposal for about $4 billion in relief, either through
reduced interest rates or further loans.
   The Finance Committee recommended that the full Senate approve
the nominations of Mulford and two other top Treasury Department
officials, Deputy Secretary-designate John E. Robson, who would be
the department's No. 2 official, and Robert R. Glauber, nominated
to be undersecretary for finance. Glauber and Mulford would be
considered the No. 3 and No. 4 officials in the department.
   Robson was formerly dean of the business school at Emory
University in Atlanta and, before that, president and chief
executive officer of the pharmaceutical firm, G.D. Searle &amp; Co., in
Skokie, Ill.
   Glauber, a professor at the Harvard Business School, has been
serving as a consultant to the Treasury Department since October
and is one of the main authors of Bush's savings and loan bailout.
Earlier, he was staff director of President Reagan's task force to
study the 1987 stock market crash.
   Mulford has been assistant secretary of the Treasury since 1984.
   The committee also recommended the nominations of Rufus H.
Yerxa, an aide on the House Ways and Means Committee, as deputy
U.S. trade representative, and Eric I. Garfinkel, an attorney, as
assistant secretary of commerce for import administration.

<HEAD>Yugoslav Jailed In Scotland For Attack On Dissident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUNFERMLINE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Yugoslav alleged to be a major in
his country's secret police was convicted Thursday of trying to
murder a dissident emigre and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   Vinklo Sindicic pleaded innocent to the charge of trying to
murder Nikola Stedul with a silenced pistol outside Stedul's home
in Scotland, and denied the prosecution's allegations that he was
in the secret police. Stedul survived wounds to the head and body.
   A High Court jury in Dunfermline found Sindicic guilty after an
11-day trial.
   Lord Allanbridge, the presiding judge, said in passing sentence
the 46-year-old defendant made a ``callous, calculated and
carefully planned attempt'' to murder Stedul.
   Stedul, 51, left Yugoslavia as a young man to avoid military
service and has lived in Scotland for 14 years. He is president of
the Croatian Movement for Statehood, which seeks independence for
Croatia, one of communist Yugoslavia's six republics.
   He told the court he was certain the shooting last Oct. 20 was
ordered by Yugoslav authorities for political reasons.
   Sindicic said he was making telephone calls to Yugoslavia at the
time of the shooting in Kirkcaldy, just north of Edinburgh. A
neighbor of the victim noted the license plate number of the car
from which the shots were fired and it was traced to Sindicic.
   After the verdict, Stedul said: `I think this trial has proven
beyond any doubt that Yugoslavia is involved in state terrorism,
and I think this is probably more importart than today's
conviction.''
   He claimed Sindicic was involved in murders in other countries
and that Yugoslav agents had killed 70 people in foreign countries
since 1969.
   Stedul, whose wife and two daughters were with him, said he felt
``a little bit safer'' with Sindicic in jail, but ``I don't believe
we will ever lead a normal life.''
   Croatian exiles have reported several attacks in recent years in
Europe and Australia.
   Croat leader Branko Jelic survived a bombing in West Berlin, and
Josip Senic, leader of the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood, was
shot to death in his bed in West Germany.

<TEXT>
   Former California Attorney General Evelle
Younger, who as a tough district attorney oversaw prosecution of
Charles Manson and Robert Kennedy's assassin Sirhan Sirhan, died at
home Thursday. He was 70.
   Police were called to Younger's Hollywood home at 8:30 a.m. and
found him dead, apparently of natural causes, said Officer Bill
Frio. His wife, Mildred, and son, Superior Court Judge Eric
Younger, were there when police arrived.
   Younger served eight years as state attorney general and won the
Republican nomination for governor in 1978 after careers as an FBI
agent, deputy city attorney, city prosecutor, municipal and
superior court judge, and district attorney.
   Younger was proud of being ``a double general,'' serving as a
general in the Air Force Reserve at the same time he was attorney
general.
   Those multiple titles were indirectly a political liability, as
his multiple pensions _ $53,226 annually from separate municipal,
judicial, state and military funds _ became a crippling campaign
issue.
   Younger was trounced by more than a million votes by incumbent
Democrat Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown in the gubernatorial election.
   ``Evelle Younger served the people of California with great
dedication and distinction,'' said former President Ronald Reagan,
who was governor of California during the first of Younger's two
terms as attorney general.
   Younger was also chief of Reagan's Task Force on Administration
of Justice.
   ``He was a loyal member of our team whose wisdom, common sense
and commitment to the cause of good government contributed much to
the betterment of our state,'' Reagan said.
   During Younger's six-year tenure as Los Angeles County district
attorney, Sirhan was tried and convicted for the June 1968
assassination of U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy. His office also brought
the first indictments against Manson and his followers for the
August 1969 Tate-LaBianca slayings.
   ``His work as a district attorney and as attorney general set
standards of hard work, ethics and dedication that many have been
hard pressed to follow,'' said U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in Washington,
D.C.
   After losing the gubernatorial election, Younger in 1979 became
a senior partner in the law firm of Buchalter, Nemer, Fields and
Chrystie.
   Younger was born June 19, 1918, in Stamford, Neb., and graduated
from the law school at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in
1940. He joined the FBI. His first assignment was New York, where
he met his future wife.
   In 1953, Gov. Earl Warren appointed Younger, then a prosecutor
for the city of Pasadena, to the Municipal Court bench. In 1958, he
was elected to the Los Angeles County Superior Court and in 1964 he
was elected Los Angeles County district attorney. He won his first
terms as attorney general in 1970.
   In 1968, he headed President-elect Richard Nixon's Crime and Law
Enforcement Task Force. Four years later, he directed the
California delegation for Nixon to Miami Beach.

   ``Scandals II'' has become the second ABC
special in a week to be dropped for lack of commercial interest,
but NBC said Thursday a delay of the TV movie ``The Prize
Pulitzer'' was not a victim of advertiser angst.
   Pressure groups responding to this season's plethora of
``reality-based'' programs _ created in response to last summer's
writers' strike _ have caused advertisers to think twice before
associating themselves with stories of devil worship, brutal crime
and sex scandal.
   Both ``Scandals II'' and last week's ``Crimes of Passion II,''
also pulled for lack of advertisers, were sequels to specials that
had racked up decent ratings, if not critical acclaim, earlier this
season.
   When ABC tried to sell the second batch in a low-rated Saturday
time period this month, no advertisers wanted to buy time.
   USA Today reported Thursday that NBC had also dropped ``The
Prize Pulitzer,'' a TV movie based on Roxanne Pulitzer's
sensationalistic biography, for similar reasons. But NBC spokesman
Curt Block denied the report.
   The decision to put off ``The Prize Pulitzer'' until next season
was made in January and is unrelated to any bailout of advertisers,
Block said.
   ``It is not in response to `Crimes of Passion' and `Scandals'
and these things that we made this move,'' he said. ``Rolling over
(delaying) to the next season is something all the networks do all
of the time.''
   The delay of ``The Prize Pulitzer'' was announced in a March 22
news release that also mentioned a Perry Mason movie and two other
made-for-TV films that were being delayed until next season, Block
said.
   In a statement on the ``Scandals II'' move, ABC Entertainment
President Robert Iger said the network was ``considering the
appropriate role for reality-based programming on our schedule. In
the interim we will consider each program on a case-by-case basis.''
   ``Crimes of Passion II'' was replaced by two half-hour comedy
pilots that wound up in the bottom five in the Nielsens. A one-hour
drama will likely replace ``Scandals II'' this Saturday, said ABC
spokesman Jim Brochu in Los Angeles.
   The first ``Scandals'' program was one of several fact-based
shows created after last year's strike by scriptwriters. Such
``reality-based'' programming was not subject to the Writers Guild
of America contract and provided a stop-gap until regular
programming could resume.
   NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' enjoys continued healthy ratings.
So did a Geraldo Rivera special about Satan worship which aired on
NBC, though it was attacked for lurid content. NBC said that
despite high ratings, the network lost money on the special because
of advertiser pullout.
   In recent weeks, advertisers have pulled commercials from NBC's
``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Nightingales'' and have expressed
concern about the Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With
Children,'' though its commercial time was sold out for the rest of
the season.
   SNL was criticized for a sketch that involved repeated use of
the word ``penis.'' ``Nightingales'' has been blasted by nursing
groups for its cheesecake depictions of the nursing profession.
   ``Married ... With Children'' is a decidedly raunchy
counterpunch to sitcoms such as ``The Cosby Show.'' It is Fox's
highest-rated show _ next to ``America's Most Wanted,'' which asks
viewers to help solve re-enacted, real-life crimes.

<HEAD>Union Official Says Workers Will Gain Right to Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's highest ranking union official says
that under new laws, labor unions in the Soviet Union will have the
right to strike to back up their demands.
   Stepan A. Shalaev, chairman of the Central Council of Trade
Unions, made it clear, however, that the council does not envision
strikes becoming common.
   ``The decision to stop work at an enterprise _ this is an
extreme measure to be taken only in extreme circumstances,'' he
said in an interview published Wednesday the labor newspaper Trud.
   He said that unions ``must have the right to stop work at
enterprises, in organizations and institutions as a means of
pressure on the administration for speeding up the resolution of
labor disputes.''
   New regulations are included in a draft law published Saturday
and will be discussed by the unions for the next three months,
Shalaev said. The Supreme Soviet parliament will have to approve
the legislation.
   Shalaev said unions will be free of government interference in
organization and financial activity and local union officials will
be independent of the administration of the factory or office where
they work.
   Workers must be protected from losing their jobs because of
union activity, he added.
   The laws are aimed at awakening the unions from decades of quiet
subservience to the Communist Party and government. The legislation
granting unions a limited right to strike appears to be an effort
to keep labor unrest from reaching the point that led to formation
in Poland of the Solidarity free trade union federation.
   Labor unrest has spread in certain industries, notably mining,
as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms take hold and
greater openness encourages Soviets to speak out on issues
affecting them.
   Soviet unions are not now permitted to strike by law, and
instead are quiet partners with management and the Communist Party.
In Communist ideology, strikes are viewed as a Western phenomenon
arising from management's exploitation of workers.
   Soviet unions traditionally have done nothing to advance
employees' wage and work condition demands, but busied themselves
instead with building and organizing housing for union members,
operating vacation facilities for members and the like. The law
gives unions wider rights over distribution of housing and other
local issues such as ecological protection, Shalaev said.

   Oliver North lost his pension as a retired
Marine officer when he was convicted Thursday and he won't get it
back unless the verdict is overturned on appeal, a Pentagon
spokeswoman said.
   North, who retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps
with 20 years of active-duty service, has been drawing an annual
military pension of roughly $23,100 since leaving the corps almost
exactly a year ago.
   At the time of his retirement, North said he was leaving the
service in order to better prepare his defense against charges of
misconduct stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.
   On Thursday, the former National Security Council aide was
convicted on three felony counts and cleared of nine others. The
jury found North guilty of shredding documents, accepting an
illegal gratuity and one count of aiding and abetting in an
obstruction of Congress.
   North had been receiving his pension since he retired, said Army
Lt. Col Linda Dumoulin, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
   But once the conviction becomes legally effective _ when the
secretary of the Navy is formally notified of it and the paperwork
is completed _ North will lose his pension, she said.
   ``Once the conviction goes into effect, whatever time that is,
he loses his retired pay. I know he's been convicted, but I don't
know exactly what time it takes effect, whether it's today or
tomorrow, or whatever,'' she said.
   If North wins on appeal, he will get the pension back and will
be given pay retroactively, she said.
   Under federal law, a retired officer's pension is not
jeopardized by just any felony conviction. Rather, it depends upon
the nature of the specific charge.
   And according to Lt. Col. Fred Peck, a Marine Corps spokesman,
only one of the charges on which North was convicted can result in
loss of his pension _ the charge of destroying NSC records.
   ``The conviction on that count requires the forfeiture by North
of his office; in other words, his status as a retired lieutenant
colonel in the Marine Corps,'' Peck said. ``And that means you lose
the pension.''
   Under normal procedures, Peck said the secretary of the Navy
would issue an order directing revocation of North's pension once
he's formally advised of the conviction.
   Monthly pension payments will then be withheld, pending the
results of any appeal. Should North succeed with an appeal, he
would then be entitled to restoration of his pension and back pay.

<HEAD>Official: Vietnam Made Mistake in Not Condemning Khmer Rouge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's foreign minister was quoted
Thursday as saying his country erred when it did not immediately
condemn the communist Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians in 1975-1978.
   Despite the mistake, Nguyen Co Thach said in an interview in the
Bangkok Post, Vietnam corrected itself when it invaded Cambodia in
late 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge government.
   Thach spoke in Bangkok Wednesday before returning to Hanoi, the
newspaper said.
   Vietnam's communists helped form the Cambodian Communist Party
and gave military aid and direction to the Khmer Rouge, whose
insurgents won a five-year civil war and overthrew the U.S.-backed
Lon Nol government in April 1975.
   Over the next three years and eight months, the Khmer Rouge
killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and
slave labor camps in its attempt to fashion an agrarian society
along communist lines.
   After Thach condemned the crimes of the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol
Pot, the interviewer said: ``But the Vietnamese did not condemn Pol
Pot before.''
   ``Yes, it is our mistake,'' Thach was quoted as saying. ``But we
have corrected our mistake by military means.''
   Vietnam did nothing until 1978, when it invaded Cambodia
following border attacks in which the Khmer Rouge killed thousands
of Vietnamese villagers.
   ``And now, what is the position of the Western countries?''
Thach was quoted as saying. ``They condemn them only by words, not
by deeds. And when we condemn them by force, they condemn Vietnam,
so it is a pity.''
   Some Asian and Western nations say the Khmer Rouge must be part
of a future coalition government because it might otherwise try to
take power by military means. Some reports have said the guerrillas
have stocked up arms for an all-out offensive after Vietnam
completes its promised troop withdrawal in September.
   Hun Sen, premier of the Vietnamese-installed government in
Cambodia, tried to rule out any future role for the Khmer Rouge at
this week's talks in Indonesia with resistance leaders Prince
Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann.
   The two non-communist leaders are allied with the Khmer Rouge in
the resistance coalition. They say they hate the Khmer Rouge but
need its 30,000 to 40,000 guerrillas.
   In Washington, the United States praised the progress made in
the latest round of talks in Jakarta, Indonesia, but said Vietnam
must pull its troops out for any agreement to work.
   ``We believe the concessions discussed can help achieve a
comprehensive and durable settlement to bring peace and stability
to the Cambodian people,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``The key remains Vietnam's total withdrawal. Hanoi should meet
its September deadline without preconditions, and under
internationally acceptable verification,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Thach also welcomed the results of the talks in Indonesia.
   ``Now is is clear they have made some progress, to have
appropriate reconciliation, formula and mechanism on the basis of
the reality in Kampuchea (Cambodia),'' he was quoted as saying. ``I
think it is a good direction.''
   The State Department reaffirmed its views that once the
Vietnamese withdraw, ``Prince Sihanouk's role as a leader of an
interim coalition preceding elections remains essential.''
   That comment appeared a response to reports that Sihanouk told
Hun Sen he would consider striking a separate deal with him if no
agreement is reached on inclusion of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge
in an interim government.

<TEXT>
   A woman went to federal appeals court Thursday to
fight demolition of her rustic Cape Cod dunes cottage that she
claims is a historical relic, capping a legal battle with literary
overtones that began in 1967.
   Grace E. Bessay says her Provincetown shack is one of a cluster
of primitive beach cabins that for a century have been used as
creative retreats by artists, poets, writers and celebrated
bohemians, including Jack Kerouac and Eugene O'Neill.
   The Massachusetts Historical Commission has recommended that
Miss Bessay's shack on Cape Cod National Seashore and 17 others
belong on the National Register of Historic Places.
   The National Park Service, which overseas the national seashore,
says it has identified shacks visited by notable artists, but Miss
Bessay's cottage wasn't among them.
   It says cottages frequented by such literary lights as O'Neill,
Mabel Dodge and Edmund Wilson are no longer standing, and there is
no proof that the likes of e.e. cummings, Kerouac and Norman Mailer
spent time in the rickety buildings that still cling to the
isolated dunes.
   The government's lawyer says the case before the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals turns not on its literary merits but on arcane
matters of squatters' rights, the definition of a dwelling and
tangled questions of titles.
   The government condemned the shack in 1967 _ Miss Bessay says
illegally _ but lawsuits prevented its demolition. Most neighbors,
meanwhile, have given up and many reached agreements that will
allow their cottages to be demolished after their deaths, she said.
   Miss Bessay's is the oldest of the dune shack cases still
pending in federal court, according to one of her lawyers, William
P. Homans, who said at least one of the original judges has died.
   Miss Bessay, who winters in Cambridge, says she is in her
mid-60s but won't be specific. ``I have aged, I must say, by all
this litigation,'' she said. ``Some days I feel like I'm 110.''
   She said this legal battle and an earlier, unsuccessful fight to
keep two other dune cottages in Truro, have consumed ``about half
of my life, one way or another _ but I am a preservationist and a
conservationist, God help me.''
   The government's attorney, David Shilton, argued that Miss
Bessay does not have clear title to her property, which she
inherited from a friend in 1981.
   Furthermore, he said, the shack does not have modern
electricity, sewage lines or running water that would qualify it as
the type of home that Congress intended to preserve when it created
the national seashore in 1961.
   Miss Bessay said that is exactly why artists and nature-lovers
like it.
   ``I don't want a generator banging away and making smells of
gasoline,'' she said. Living in a dune shack, she said, means
``getting your water by hand pumps, which is a pleasure. It isn't a
burden, it's a pleasure. And kerosene lamps for light, that is also
a pleasure.
   ``If I were an Amish person or a Menonnite, everyone would think
it was wonderful,'' she said. ``And it is.''

   President Bush said Thursday ``the world will
be looking'' to see if there is government fraud in Panama's
elections Sunday. But he declined to say if he would reconsider
relinquishing control of the Panama Canal should the elections not
be ``free and fair.''
   The Senate voted 100-0 to approve a resolution condemning any
attempts by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to manipulate the election
process and insisting that ``the Noriega regime conduct the
election in a free and fair manner.''
   Bush, at a White House news conference with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, called on the Panamanian people to do what
they can to pressure Noriega and his powerful military forces to
hold fair elections.
   Noriega is not a candidate in Sunday's election, but has an ally
running for president and is seen as the country's de facto ruler.
   Bush declined to answer directly when asked about a comment by
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich that Americans will not
tolerate turning over the canal to a Noriega regime.
   The United States has signed a treaty under which the
U.S.-controlled canal will come under Panama's jurisdiction at the
end of the cetury.
   Bush said, ``My view on that is to warn Panama that the world
will be looking at them, not just the United States, in terms of
these elections, deciding what to do if the elections are
fraudulent, calling on them for free and fair elections.''
   As to what moves he might have in mind to follow up the
rhetorical attacks he has been making on Noriega and the Panamanian
electoral process, Bush said:
   ``There will be international observers there and then we'll
cross whatever hypothetical bridge we may have to cross later on.
   ``But this does give me an opportunity to say that I have been
very disturbed by the reports that the election will be less than
free and less that fair and less than open.
   ``I simply want ... to encourage the people in Panama to do
everything they can to guarantee free and fair elections. And what
pressures they can bring to bear on ... Mr. Noriega, I don't know.''
   His call appeared to be a subtle urging to Panamanian opposition
forces to reinvigorate the energetic anti-Noriega protests that
were prevalent in Panama last year.
   In the Senate, Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the
United States ``cannot much longer tolerate Noriega's corrupt,
reckless and repressive rule in Panama.''
   ``We cannot much longer permit vital U.S. interests _ including
the Panama Canal and the U.S. Southern Command _ to remain squarely
in Noriega's gunsights,'' Dole said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the resolution puts the
Senate strongly on record as demanding ``an end to the continuing
trauma of Gen. Noriega's rule of repression.''
   The Senate resolution also called on Bush to report to Congress
on the fairness of the elections and to ``consult with Congress on
the future course of action for United States foreign policy in
Panama.''
   One administration official noted that since the street
demonstrations have died down, it is more difficult for the United
States to spur internal momentum to remove Noriega.
   Gingrich suggested after he and a group of Republican
congressional leaders met with Bush on Thursday morning that
continued domination of Panama by Noriega could jeopardize the 1979
treaties under which the United States agreed to turn over the
canal to Panamanian control in 1999.
   Administration officials have indicated, however, that treading
such ground is a risky area, and one that is not high among the
options the administration is considering.
   U.S. credibility, particularly in Latin America, would be
seriously damaged if the government backed out of the treaty,
officials have said.
   Bush and his advisers have been weighing a series of options for
what policy to employ toward Panama after a fraudulent election.
   They have declined to say what they are looking at, only that
all options are being considered, including involving U.S. allies
in isolating Noriega.
   The United States has a substantial military force based in
Panama.
   Bush this week is sending a team of observers to represent his
administration at Sunday's elections.
   It was not known how the observers will be received by Noriega,
who has sought to limit the number of private observers allowed in
for the election.

   The verdict in Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra
trial gave both sides credible claims to partial victory in the
grueling battle for the jury's votes.
   ``You can't say at this juncture that either side walked away
with their theory intact,'' said Washington attorney Lawrence
Barcella.
   Although North stands convicted of three felony charges, the
jury acquitted him of all the charges that he lied to Congress _
including an allegation that he falsely answered lawmakers'
questions during a face-to-face meeting.
   ``There is something there for everyone,'' said Washington
attorney Richard Ven-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor.
   Throughout the case, prosecutors for independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh argued that North's lies to Congress cut to the
heart of the democratic process by subverting the government's
reliance on truth.
   But jurors cleared the former presidential aide of these
charges, accepting North's denials that he helped prepare false
statements. Jurors also apparently accepted North's explanation
that when he did participate in fabrications, it was on orders from
superiors.
   The jury's verdict on these counts was the worst defeat for
Walsh, whose office has spent $16 million investigating and
prosecuting North and the other Iran-Contra defendants.
   After dropping charges that North conspired to illegally divert
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels, Walsh was
left with a case that North lied, cheated and stole money.
   Ben-Veniste noted that North was cleared of lies to Congress
that allegedly took place while the Contra resupply operation was
still secret but convicted him of destroying documents and aiding
and abetting obstruction of a congressional inquiry once the affair
was publicly known.
   ``I think perhaps they drew a distinction between the potential
for jeopardizing lives and assets while the mission was still
secret and what occurred after public revelations,'' Ben-Veniste
said.
   North himself appeared quite elated by the jury's verdicts
moments after it was announced in court. He gave his wife Betsy a
broad smile before kissing her.
   Later, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel called the verdict
a ``partial vindiction'' and vowed in his soldierly way to fight
``for as long as it takes to prevail.''
   The jury's decision that North illegally destroyed National
Security Council documents and aided and abetted the obstruction of
the first congressional inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair was a
vindication for the prosecution.
   Lead prosecutor John Keker, noting that North stood ``convicted
of three serious felony charges,'' insisted the result showed that
``the principle that no man is above the law has been vindicated.''
   Nevertheless, the jury rejected the prosecution notion that
North was a thief, acquitting him of a charge that he converted
$4,300 worth of travelers checks given to him by Contra leaders to
his personal use.
   It did find that North illegally accepted a gratuity when he let
arms dealer Richard V. Secord build a security system outside his
suburban Virginia home.
   North's admission that he fabricated proof that he had paid for
the security system probably showed to the jury that he understood
what he had done was wrong.
   Testimony by former national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane about North's alleged role in the preparation of written
responses to inquiries from various House committees was equivocal,
at best.
   North told jurors he wanted to invoke executive privilege and
refuse to answer one query.
   In another case, he said he edited a letter but didn't have any
authority to make any substantive changes.
   North admitted he lied to members of the House Intelligence
Committee on Aug. 6, 1986 but told jurors that he only attended the
meeting at the insistence of his boss, then-national security John
Poindexter.
   ``You can't really tell from the verdict whether they rejected
the authorization defense or not,'' Barcella said. ``It appears to
be a very fact-bound decision.''
   The jury appeared to reject the authorization defense when it
convicted North of aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress
in November, 1986 when a false chronology of the U.S.-Iran
arms-for-hostages deals was prepared for lawmakers.
   ``One could hardly say this was a jury that had it in for Ollie
North,'' Ben-Veniste said.

<HEAD>Forest Service To Push Its Spotted Owl Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Forest Service will propose in
upcoming talks that its controversial plan for preserving spotted
owl habitat in the Northwest be implemented while the bird is under
consideration for listing as a threatened species, a top agency
official said Thursday.
   The plan has been widely criticized by environmentalists, who
say it is inadequate to ensure the survival of the owl, and the
timber industry, which believes it locks up too much of the forests
to logging.
   A federal judge in Seattle has banned sales involving nearly 1
billion board feet of ancient timber in the Northwest's national
forests while he considers a court challenge to the Forest
Service's plan.
   In related developments Thursday, the Forest Service said it has
identified potential sales involving roughly 280 million board feet
of timber that could be substituted for sales currently enjoined.
The sales would involve so called ``thinning'' operations with
trees in the 50-year-old to 70-year-old range. Some of the sales
could be offered by late summer.
   And Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said efforts are underway to bring
together the Oregon and Washington congressional delegations to
discuss the spotted owl situation.
   George Leonard, associate chief of the Forest Service, said in
an interview that implementation of his agency's plan to protect
spotted owl habitat will ``allow us to get on to some semblance of
a timber sale program.
   ``We want to get the Fish and Wildlife Service to agree that our
spotted owl habitat plan could be used for a couple of years.''
   The agency's plan would set aside between 1,000 and 2,700 acres
for each of the estimated 2,000 breeding pairs of spotted owls in
the region.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service proposed last week that the owl,
thought to live almost exclusively in the old-growth forests of
Washington, Oregon and northern California, should be listed as a
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.
   Under the act, the Fish and Wildlife Service has up to two years
to decide whether the owl should officially be listed and to
develop management plans to protect it.
   Leonard said during those two years, implementation of the
Forest Service's owl plan would ``allow us to follow through on the
sales program we have planned. And we think it ensures the
viability of the owl.''
   The Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and the National
Park Service has requested a ``conference'' with the Fish and
Wildlife Service to discuss the short-term impact of the proposed
listing of the bird.
   Leonard said Secretary of Interior Manuel Lujan and Secretary of
Agriculture Clayton Yeutter also will meet next week to discuss the
spotted owl. The Forest Service is part of the Agriculture
Department and the Bureau of Land Management part of the Interior
Department.
   Environmentalists said they were ``disappointed'' with the
Forest Service's decision to push its plan.
   ``It's odd that the agency remains entrenched around a plan that
has been widely discredited,'' said Jay Watson, who handles
national forest issues for The Wilderness Society. ``It seemed like
we were moving away from that type of statement and starting
afresh.''
   Leonard warned that if logging were banned in all spotted owl
habitat, timber sales in the national forests of the Northwest
would be cut by about half in the short term and about one-third
over the long term.
   In addition, Leonard said the domestic supply of softwood lumber
would be diminished by between 10 and 15 percent.

<TEXT>
   One of two Indian activists charged in
the takeover of a newspaper last year pleaded guilty to 14 counts
of second-degree kidnapping and was sentenced to six years in
prison Thursday.
   Timothy Jacobs, 20, had faced up to 420 years in prison on 14
counts of first-degree kidnapping before he agreed to a plea
bargain with Robeson County District Attorney Robert Townsend.
   ``There have been attempts by some to portray Timothy Jacobs as
the victim in this case,'' Townsend said. ``But I don't want anyone
in this courtroom to leave today thinking that. The hostages and
their families were the victims.''
   Jacobs and Eddie Hatcher held at least 14 people hostage in The
Robesonian newsroom in Lumberton for 10 hours on Feb. 1, 1988. They
carried shotguns when they entered and chained shut the newspaper's
front door.
   The Indians said they took over the newspaper to draw attention
to allegations of official corruption and drug trafficking in the
county. A task force appointed by Gov. Jim Martin found no evidence
to support the allegations.
   ``If Timothy Jacobs suffered, so be it,'' Townsend told the
crowded courtroom. ``He has brought it about himself. It's an
insult to all races to think that Timothy Jacobs' efforts have
brought changes in Robeson County.''
   The southeastern North Carolina county is one-third white,
one-third black and one-third Indian, primarily members of the
Lumbee tribe.
   ``I was very satisified with the sentencing,'' said Deborah
Adams, one of the hostages. ``I felt he did deserve to spend some
time ... but not 30 years in prison. The last thing I've heard out
of him is he may be trying to change from last year. I hope that's
true.''
   ``He wants to get on with his life and do something with
himself,'' said his mother, Eleanor Jacobs, after the court
appearance. ``It was his decision (to plea bargain). I didn't talk
him into anything.''
   Jacobs' six-year prison term will be followed by a six-year
suspended sentence with supervised probation.
   Superior Court Judge Anthony Brannon ruled that if any books or
movies are produced about the takeover, any money earned by Jacobs
will be forfeited to the victims of the takeover. Court documents
list 14 Robesonian employees as the people detained, but
authorities said up to 20 had been held at various times the night
of the siege.
   The judge also allowed Jacobs to be free for 30 days on bond
despite objections from Townsend. Asked what he would do during the
30-day leave, Jacobs told reporters, ``Enjoy myself. ... Sign a
movie contract.''
   Hatcher, 31, is being held in a San Francisco jail under $1
million bond and has an extradition hearing scheduled for Friday.
   Both Hatcher and Jacobs fled after the 1988 state indictments,
which followed their acquittal on federal charges. Jacobs escaped
to a Madison County, N.Y., Indian reservation, and Hatcher sought
refuge on an Idaho reservation.
   Hatcher later asked the Soviet consulate in San Francisco for
political asylum but his plea was rejected and authorities arrested
him.

   A proposal by the House Ways and Means
Committee to discourage corporate takeovers helped trigger the
record stock market crash of October 1987, concludes a study
released Thursday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
approved a bill imposing a tax on takeovers on Oct. 15, 1987, just
four days before the record 508-point decline in the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks.
   The bill, which would have limited the deductibility of debt
used in takeovers, has long been mentioned as one among many
factors contributing to the crash.
   However, the study, conducted by the SEC's Office of Economic
Analysis, said the legislation was ``a fundamental economic event''
causing a 10 percent drop in the market from Oct. 14-16, a decline
that in turn probably triggered the Oct. 19 crash.
   Other factors that have been cited as causing the crash have
been rising interest rates, a dispute between the United States and
West Germany over the value of the dollar, the U.S. trade and
budget deficit.
   In support of their thesis, SEC researchers Mark L. Mitchell and
Jeffry M. Netter say the market as measured by the Standard and
Poors 500 index dropped 2.95 percent on Oct. 14, the day after word
of the proposed legislation was released, and 5.16 percent on Oct.
16, the day after the committee passed the bill.
   The market jumped 4.93 percent on Oct. 29 and 2.87 percent on
Oct. 30 after it was reported that the legislation would be changed.
   The study said traders known as risk arbitragers, who speculate
in stocks of companies targeted for takeover, reacted negatively to
news of the bill's progress and positively to news of fading
congressional support for the measure.

<TEXT>
   The official count confirmed Thursday
that Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who led the coup that toppled Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner, won the presidential election this week with
nearly 75 percent of the vote.
   Central Electoral Board results from all but 744 of 10,970
voting booths showed Rodriguez received 851,190 votes, or 74.3
percent. His closest rival for the presidency, Domingo Laino,
received 232,421, or 20.3 percent.
   The tallies coincide with unofficial results disclosed hours
after polls closed Monday.
   Rodriguez, an aide of Stroessner, drove him from power on Feb. 3
after nearly 35 years of dictatorship.
   Laino, president of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, still
complained about irregularities in the balloting and said his party
would decide Friday whether to accept its 10 seats in the Senate
and 19 in the Chamber of Deputies.
   ``There are some very suspicious maneuvers and we are very
concerned,'' Laino said.
   Political observers called Laino's actions a political maneuver
to fend off opposition within his own party, where a faction that
wanted to boycott the vote has dubbed him the ``marshal of defeat.''
   Irregularities abounded, but losing candidates and international
monitors said the results seemed accurate.
   Official results for congress gave the Colorados 804,159 votes,
or 72.9 percent. Laino's party received 221,947, or 20.1 percent.
   Colorados were awarded 24 of the 36 Senate seats and 48 of the
72 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. By law, the party that
receives a majority is entitled to two-thirds of the seats in the
upper and lower houses.
   Laino also ran for congress and was elected senator, as was the
third-place finisher in the balloting for president, Fernando Vera
of the Revolutionary Febrerista party.

<HEAD>Carter: News Media `Too Timid' in Asserting Rights Overseas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said Thursday the
news media have shown ``an absence of courage'' by failing to
assert press rights in restrictive nations such as South Africa.
   ``Whenever an oppressive government like the one in South Africa
attempts to suppress the world press as they have in the past, the
press has been too dormant, too timid _ I hesitate to use the word
cowardly _ in fighting back,'' Carter told contributors to Cable
News Network's ``World Report'' program, who are meeting in Atlanta.
   Carter said reporters have surrendered too easily when faced
with government restrictions, and by doing so have encouraged
suppression by other world leaders.
   ``Had the press, collectively and individually, said, `We will
not abide by this censorship,' I think you could very well have
lessened the amount of restraint on the news coverage out of South
Africa,'' Carter said.
   The government of South Africa, under state-of-emergency
regulations enacted in 1986, prohibits reporting of unrest, most
forms of peaceful protest and a wide range of statements by
opposition groups. The nation has been torn by unrest because of
its official policy of racial segregation, or apartheid.
   ``I think the precedent that was established in South Africa is
one of almost disgrace to the news media, who have shown an absence
of courage,'' Carter said.
   Carter said journalists would do better to risk expulsion from
nations with severe press restrictions, rather than to stay and
become ``pawns'' of the government.
   Carter is scheduled to go to Panama Friday as part of an
international delegation monitoring that country's elections on
Sunday.

   Two members of an Israeli-sponsored
militia were killed Thursday when their armored personnel carrier
hit a mine in Israel's south Lebanon ``security zone,'' police
reported.
   A police statement said said the mine explosion occurred near
Khiyam, 2 miles north of the Israeli border.
   The 2,500-member militia helps Israeli soldiers patrol the zone,
which ranges in depth from 6 to 10 miles and was established when
Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 1985 after three years of invasion
and occupation.
   Voice of the South, a radio station operated by the
predominantly Christian militia, said a militia patrol captured a
guerrilla in the no-man's land that separates the Syrian-controlled
Bekaa Valley town of Hasbaya from the eastern flank of the security
zone.
   It said guerrilla was ``among a group that tried to infiltrate
into the security zone,'' but provided no further identification. A
patrol ``encircled the group and arrested one of the
infiltrators,'' the radio said.

<TEXT>
   A former Atlantic Fleet Sailor of the Year
pleaded guilty to espionage Thursday and was sentenced to 12 years
in prison.
   Craig Dee Kunkle, 39, of Virginia Beach, was arrested Jan. 10 in
a Williamsburg motel by two FBI agents posing as representatives of
the Soviet Union. The former chief petty officer took $5,000 for
telling the agents anti-submarine warfare secrets, evidence showed.
   ``I realize I made a serious mistake and I am not proud of my
actions,'' Kunkle told U.S. District Judge Robert G. Doumar. ``I
was born an American. I'm proud to be an American. God willing,
I'll die one,'' he said.
   Doumar imposed the 12-year sentence agreed upon by prosecutors
and Kunkle's attorneys. The judge also ordered Kunkle to pay $550
in fines and court costs and placed him on three years supervised
probation after his release.
   ``Any attempt to reveal secret or top-secret information to a
foreign government places in jeopardy the lives of the people,''
the judge said. ``It cannot be tolerated.''
   Doumar said Kunkle's attempt at espionage was unsophisticated
and caused little damage to national security.
   U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson said Kunkle told the agents what
he remembered about the Navy's acoustic intelligence techniques and
did not pass any classified documents.
   ``While there was harm to the national security, it was not
significant,'' Hudson told reporters. ``His motivation was greed.''
   Court records indicate that Kunkle had a history of alcohol and
cocaine abuse and received a less-than-honorable discharge from the
Navy.
   Kunkle's attorney, Gregory N. Stillman, said Kunkle pleaded
guilty because he did not want to subject his family to a trial.
   Kunkle, who was working as a security guard before his arrest,
entered the Navy in 1974 and was named Atlantic Fleet Sailor of the
Year in 1977. He worked as an anti-submarine warfare specialist
before he left the Navy in 1985.
   Kunkle called the Soviet Embassy in Washington late last year.
An FBI agent posing as a Soviet official called him back and had
Kunkle mail him information at an Alexandria post office box.
   The FBI secretly videotaped a Williamsburgt meeting and got
Kunkle to sign a receipt for his $5,000 payment.
   Kunkle's father is a retired Navy commander and his brother is
an active-duty commander.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Thursday offered
words of consolation for those dying of AIDS and urged Christians
of different churches to support each other.
   ``If we cannot at this point agree on all matters, we can and
must avoid all forms of competition and rivalry,'' the pope said.
   The Pope made his plea in Lusaka, Zambia, at an ecumenical
gathering of Christians attended by three top leaders of the
African National Congress, the main guerrilla movement fighting
South Africa's apartheid system of racial separation.
   He then traveled to this British colony for the final leg of his
four-nation pilgrimage to African and Indian Ocean countries.
   In Blantyre, the pope was greeted by President-for-Life Hastings
Kamuzu Banda and his personal troupe of hundreds of women dancers,
who swayed and ululated to the beat of African drums.
   There were no barriers or armed police holding back the
thousands of Malawians lining the route into town to glimpse the
pope. Instead, they stood in a perfect line, grouped in bright
color-coordinated uniforms, barely moving.
   On Friday, the pontiff was scheduled to celebrate Mass for an
estimated 250,000 people before returning to Rome on Saturday.
   At an earlier Mass in Lusaka, John Paul made his first reference
to AIDS, which has ravaged Zambia. The World Health Organization
estimates that more than 10 percent of Zambia's urban population is
infected with the AIDS virus, and development agencies say the
figure could be far higher.
   Zambia has a population of 7.5 million.
   ``The church proclaims a message of hope to those of you who
suffer in Zambia today ... to the sick and dying, especially the
victims of AIDS, and to those who lack medical care,'' the pontiff
said.
   The 100,000 people attending the Mass included President Kenneth
Kaunda, who lost his 30-year-old son Masuzgo to AIDS in December
1986.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the immune system
and leaves the body defenseless against infection.

   Thunderstorms struck parts of the South on Thursday with at
least two tornadoes, heavy rain, hail and 70-mph winds, toppling 89
electrical towers in Louisiana and causing scattered damage and
power outages elsewhere.
   Thunderstorms had produced severe weather in Louisiana and Texas
late Wednesday and during the night, and on Thursday they spread
across parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 2.92 inches of rain fell
on Jackson, Miss., while 1.64 inches and baseball-sized hail fell
on the Monroe, La., area.
   ``My car looks like the surface of the moon,'' said Greg Gulyas,
a reporter at Monroe radio station KJLO.
   Lexington elementary school in Monroe suffered extensive damage.
``It hit our windows on the north side and we went into our drills
and got the kids inside,'' said principal Charles Roaner.
   The toppled transmission towers, which were 60 to 70 feet tall
and supposedly built to withstand 100-mph winds, supported a
500,000-volt line in a 50-mile stretch between Talullah and
Vicksburg, Miss, said Charles Thacker, a division marketing manager
for Louisiana Power &amp; Light.
   As many as 10,000 LP&amp;L customers across the northern portion of
the state were temporarily without power, he said.
   Mississippi authorities reported one small tornado that caused
tree damage, and a second twister that wrecked two mobile homes,
but caused no injuries, in Pelahatchie.
   In Vicksburg, Miss., the Warren County Sheriff's Department said
trees and power lines were down and electricity was off in schools
and other buildings inside and outside the city limits after
thunderstorms. A spokeswoman said roofs had been ripped off houses
and that one woman was taken to a hospital after a tree fell on her
car.
   In downtown Vicksburg, two businesses had extensive roof damage
and a lumber company reported major damage with one wall blown in.
   Half an inch of rain fell in seven minutes at Vicksburg, the
National Weather Service said.
   The weather service said the storm system produced wind blowing
at 60 to 70 mph in parts of Mississippi.
   At Newton, Miss., an airport employee reported that high wind
had broken airplane tiedowns and blew over one small airplane.
   The weather service also reported wind damage in parts of
Arkansas and Texas, where wind gusted to 72 at Graford.
   Showers and thunderstorms also spread into central Alabama,
western Tennessee and western Kentucky.
   Elsewhere, showers prevailed from Illinois to Minnesota, with
showers over the central high Plains region.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 98 at Gila Bend,
Ariz. Thursday's low for the 48 contiguous states was 25 degrees at
Alamosa, Colo.
   For Friday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from the
Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast states.
   Highs only in the 40s were predicted from central North Dakota
through Minnesota to Upper Michigan; in the 40s and 50s from the
northern and central high Plains to the upper Great Lakes region;
above 80 from the Pacific Coast through much of Arizona and much of
Texas to Florida and southern Georgia; and in the 90s or above 100
in the desert Southwest and the valleys of southern California.

<HEAD>Man Beaten Into Coma After Argument Over Rap Singing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men beat a man into a coma after the
three had a drunken argument about who was the better rap singer,
police said.
   Willie Lee Walker, 34, was attacked by the two men with sticks
and a board and had a 20-pound concrete block dropped on his head
at least twice, said Tacoma Police spokesman Mark Mann.
   ``They just drank themselves silly and got into an argument,''
Mann said.
   Walker was comatose and in critical condition at Tacoma General
Hospital on Thursday, Mann said.
   A 25-year-old man was arrested Wednesday for investigation of
aggravated assault but was not immediately charged, police said.
   The attack took place early Wednesday morning after the three
argued at the apartment of one of the suspects.
   Walker was found in the entrance to an alley by police who
responded to calls from neighborhood residents, but his assailants
had fled by the time police and medical assistance arrived.
   Detectives followed a trail of blood from the crime scene to the
apartment. The arrested man was found to have cut and bloody
knuckles, and blood-stained clothes and shoes were found in the
apartment, police said.
   The suspect told detectives the three men spent Tuesday night
and early Wednesday morning drinking, and an argument over who was
the better rapper developed into a fistfight, Mann said. Walker ran
from the apartment and the two other men gave chase, Mann said.
   The second assailant was not identitied, Mann said.

<TEXT>
   Makeshift measures filled the gap left by
23,000 fired bus workers Thursday as Mexico City's government
grabbed the chance to revamp its inefficient transport system.
   The drivers went on strike and were fired Wednesday, causing
some panic, but a spot survey showed commuters Thursday were just
15 minutes to half an hour late.
   ``As you can see, there's almost no problem,'' city spokesman
Alfonso Marin said in a telephone interview. He said a panel of
experts is meeting to discuss the reorganization.
   ``We will come up with a solution in about a week. Right now, we
don't know what shape it will take, but we are working it out,''
Marin said.
   The fact that nearly a quarter of the capital's 8.5 million
residents took the week off work reduced the strike's impact.
Monday _ international labor day _ was an official holiday, and on
Friday, Mexico commemorates an 1862 victory over the French.
   Union secretary-general Nacio Chicuellar said he hopes the
government will reverse its decision to fire all striking drivers,
mechanics and clerks. ``We hope so. We're waiting for them to give
us an appointment,'' he said.
   Ricardo Barco Lopez, the union's lawyer, said many strikers have
returned to their depots in hopes of going back to work.
   The Federal District, as the capital officially is called, has
8.5 million residents. About 10.5 million more live in surrounding
suburbs of the metropolitan area.
   About 9 million commute to work daily, 2 million by bus and the
rest on subways, trolleys and minibuses.
   The 23,000 bus workers walked off their jobs early Wednesday,
rejecting a 14 percent pay raise offer and demanding 50 percent. A
conciliation board had declared the strike illegal in advance and
the government fired them all. Bus workers are Mexico's highest
paid municipal employees, earning more than $9,000 a year.
   ``The drivers were wrong. They have no right to strike,'' said
Imelda, 46, a waitress who wakes up at 5:30 a.m. to get to work
across town by 11 a.m. ``It's perfect, what the government did.''
   Wednesday night the strikers tried to return to work, but city
transportation coordinator Enrique Jackson said it was too late. A
few hours later, the city subway workers' union accepted the 14
percent increase.
   To fill gaps, Jackson authorized taxicabs to pick up multiple
fares, allowed 1,000 suburban line buses to extend their routes
into the city and charge 16 cents a ride _ four times the usual
fare. He urged motorists to help stranded commuters.
   He said bus workers can apply for jobs in the new system, but
did not say if there would be spots for them all.
   Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis' office said preliminary plans for
the bus line would make workers part owners and allow more
independent operation.
   Fare increases seem likely, in line with President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's campaign to make state-owned companies
profitable or get rid of them.
   Tens of thousands of dissident public school teachers striking
for higher pay and for union reforms marched through the streets of
Mexico City Thursday, snarling traffic between downtown and the
Presidential Palace.
   Thousands of riot police were posted along the five-mile route
but no violence was reported.
   Reporters estimated that the march swelled at times to about
150,000 teachers and supporters.
   Teachers won a 25 percent increase in wages and benefits and
ouster of a union boss closely tied to the governing party. They
want the pay offer extended to non-teaching school employees and
want negotiations speeded up on elections in at least 11 union
locals.
   The strike, called by the dissident wing of the National
Federation of Education Workers, is now in its third week and has
closed down thousands of schools nationwide.

   At least five pages in a laboratory notebook
from an ongoing scientific dispute probably were prepared up to two
years after their dates and 20 more pages were questionable, Secret
Service experts told Congres on Thursday.
   However, the scientist who compiled the notebooks, Dr. Thereza
Imanishi-Kari of Tufts University, testified that they had nothing
to do with the published report of her experiments and showed only
``I am not a neat person'' and ``I am very bad at dates.''
   Asked by the chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., to
explain Secret Service findings that a page dated Aug. 18, 1984,
had been written on a pad beneath a page dated May 18, 1985, she
said she might have waited to May to record data taken the previous
August.
   ``What possible motive would I have to cheat?'' she said. ``I
have lupus. My sister died of lupus. ... If I had fabricated data
it would have mislead science to waste its scarce resources'' being
used to find cures for such diseases.
   Other scientists and co-authors backed up her claim that the
disputed notebooks did not bear on the controversial 1986 paper in
the scientific journal Cell, which the subcommittee has been
looking into for more than a year.
   One of Dr. Imanishi-Kari's co-authors, Nobel prize winner Dr.
David Baltimore, accused Dingell of indulging in ``a classic case
case of verdict first, evidence later'' in the seven-hour hearing.
   Baltimore, a professor of molecular biology at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, accused the subcommittee staff of not
being fair after Dingell expressed ostensible dismay that the major
authors of the paper declined to respond to an informal staff
briefing last week.
   ``It's as if we had presented you with the Cell paper and asked
you to analyze it on the spot,'' Baltimore said.
   The Cell paper explored the workings of the immune system in
mice bred to have an immune system gene from another species.
   Allegations that notebook data did not support the paper, first
made by Margot O'Toole of Dr. Imanishi-Kari's lab, were
investigated by the National Institutes of Health, which paid for
the research. An NIH consultants' panel concluded that no fraud or
misrepresentation had been committed, but errors were made that the
authors should correct.
   The authors have written one correction letter to the journal
and are preparing another.
   James Wyngaarden, the outgoing director of the NIH, told the
subcommittee that he has now ordered a re-opening of the
investigation based on a new allegation from Ms. O'Toole, that data
were missing to support one of the figures of the Cell paper. Dr.
Imanishi-Kari said, however, that the scientist involved, Moema H.
Reis, now at the Biological Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, had
reported recording the missing data directly on the figures.
   John W. Hargett, chief document examiner for the Forensic
Services Division of the Secret Service, said analysis of the paper
and ink of two looseleaf notebooks showed ``At least one page in
the ... book which was presented to us as having been prepared in
1984 was not prepared in 1984, but was more consistent with the
1986 book. Four other pages in all probability were all prepared
around the same time as the 1986 pages'' and 20 other pages were
questionable.
   At least two dates appeared to have been changed, Hargett said.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan announced
Thursday that two offices have been established within the Public
Health Service to strengthen its ability to deal with scientific
misconduct.
   An Office of Scientific Integrity Review will be located at HHS
in the office of the assistant secretary for health and will
establish overall policies and procedures for dealing with
scientific misconduct.
   An Office of Scientific Integrity at the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda in suburban Washington, D.C., will monitor
investigations into scientific misconduct conducted by institutions
that receive Public Health Service funds for biomedical or
behavioral research. It will also conduct its own investigations.

   Soviet rookie hockey forward Alexander
Mogilny, viewed in the West as star material, defected Thursday
just before the world champion Soviet team left Stockholm to return
to Moscow, Swedish and Soviet media said.
   Mogilny, who turned 20 in February, did not show up at
Stockholm's airport when the Soviet national hockey team left at
noon.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Viktor Tikhonov,
head coach of the Soviet National Team, as saying the defection was
``disgusting.'' He said he believed Mogilny was lured by promises
of a lucrative contract with the National Hockey League.
   But no one in the NHL who was contacted by The Associated Press
said they knew anything of the defection.
   A spokeswoman at the Swedish Foreign Ministry said she did not
know anything about the defection. The Swedish Immigration Board
said it had not received any application from a Soviet player
seeking political asylum.
   Mogilny, who also plays for the Soviet Central Red Army team,
was the fifth-round draft pick of the Buffalo Sabres last summer.
   He would be the first Soviet player to defect. A former National
Team member, Sergei Priakin, signed with the Calgary Flames in
March after the NHL and the Soviet Hockey Federation reached an
agreement allowing him to come to North America.
   Mogilny long has been considered a troublemaker on the Soviet
hockey team. He served a ten-game suspension before the world
championships after a fight in a Soviet league game.
   A Swedish newspaper reported last week that Moligny had his
monthly salary withdrawn after the incident and that he lost his
``Masters of Sports'' order. Still, he was given permission to play
in the world championships by the Soviet Sports Committee.
   The Soviets took the world championship by defeating Canada.
   The Tass account from Moscow began, ``The victorious Soviet
squad returned here today after trouncing every team at the world
ice-hockey championships in Stockholm and leaving one of the
players behind.''
   Soviet television also reported the defection, and the
sportscaster said a caller told team officials that Mogilny ``took
the decision to join one of the teams of the National Hockey
League.''
   Tass said, ``The incident with Mogilny could harm relations
between the Soviet Hockey Federation and the NHL, observers
believe.''
   Four Soviet teams are scheduled to tour the NHL next season, and
the Calgary Flames and Washington Capitals are slated to visit the
Soviet Union in September.
   Tikhonov said that Mogilny, a junior army lieutenant, had asked
the team's managers to give him a new apartment because he was
going to marry and bring his parents to Moscow from the city of
Khabarovsk.
   Tass said the Soviet Hockey Federation and the NHL do not have
an agreement banning illegal transfers but that NHL managers have
said they will not support NHL clubs that engage in a talent-drain.
   Mogilny was in his third year with the Central Red Army team and
played 11 international games with the Soviet national team before
1988-89.
   NHL spokesman Gerry Helper said in New York that Mogilny is
regarded as one of the game's future stars. But as for the
defection, Helper said, ``It's the first I've heard of it.''
   Tass quoted Tikhonov as saying Mogilny's defection ``soured our
joyful homecoming after winning the championships,'' the coach said.
   Tikhonov described relations between the Soviet sports commitee
and the NHL as stable, and even expanding. He said Pryakhin was
signed by the Flames legally ``and to the satisfaction of all
interested sides.''
   Soviet sports authorities planned to discuss the signing of
several Soviet players for NHL clubs after the team's return from
Stockholm, Tass said.

   A U.S. military helicopter crashed and
exploded in southern France after it hit a high-tension power line
on a night training flight, and all five Marines aboard were
killed, officials said Thursday.
   The UH-1 Huey fell about 200 feet and then crashed into a
mountain stream and exploded at about 9:45 p.m. Wednesday near
Rougon, a village 60 miles northwest of Nice.
   The craft was from the amphibious assault ship Guadalcanal, in
port in Toulon, and was assigned to Marine Medium Helicopter
Squadron 162 based at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.
   In Washington, the Marine Corps identified four of the victims
as: Maj. Bruce A. Boulton, 37, a helicopter pilot from Broward
County, Fla.; 1st Lt. Michael P. Wilkes, 26, a helicopter pilot
from Akron, Ohio; Cpl. Terry A. Miles, 22, a helicopter mechanic
from Ashland, Ky.; and Lance Cpl. Matthew F. Rossell, 21, a
helicopter mechanic from Des Moines, Iowa.
   The fifth victim was identified by his father as Cpl. Lansden R.
Good III, 24, of Paducah, Ky.
   The pilots were using night-vision goggles, but military
officials said there was no reason to suspect the goggles played a
role in the crash.
   A Marine official in Washington, however, said the goggles do
not permit pilots to see power lines.
   The Army recently ordered a safety inspection of its
night-vision goggles after several crashes.
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., who favors a temporary suspension
of the goggles, called Thursday for a coordinated Pentagon
investigation and a review of the military use of the goggles.
   McCloskey said he spoke recently with a retired Army general
under whose command a fatal night training crash occurred.
   ``This individual is emphatic that the goggles are not safe for
flight use. To continue using the devices when even upper echelon
officers are recommending against it simply makes no sense,''
McCloskey said. He did not identify the Army general.
   Authorities in Digne ordered an investigation into the accident.
   The Marine Corps said the Huey was the lead helicopter of two
aircraft conducting a navigation training exercise. The other
helicopter was not involved in the accident.
   The helicopter was one of 13 taking part in France-U.S. training
exercises in southern France from April 29 to May 19, said Peter
Antico, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Paris.

   Oliver North's hometown neighbors, friends
and classmates expressed relief at his acquittal on most counts
Thursday, but some were angry that a verdict had been delivered at
all.
   ``Somebody better give him a vote of thanks,'' said the town's
former mayor, Russell Robertson. ``He was one of the nicest
scapegoats this country ever had. He took it right on the chin.''
   Robertson said President Bush should pardon North, a former star
athlete at Philmont High School.
   North was convicted Thursday of three out of 12 charges for his
role in the Iran-Contra scandal, including destroying documents. He
was acquitted of the other counts, including lying to and
obstructing Congress.
   ``I'm glad of the verdict,'' said Charlene Yorck, who also felt
North was made a scapegoat by his superiors. ``If President Reagan
didn't have anything to hide, why didn't he get up on the stand?''
   North is remembered fondly by many in this town 45 miles south
of Albany where an Oliver North Day parade was held two years ago
and stores stocked up on magazines with the hometown boy on the
cover.
   In August 1987, a crowd of more than 2,000 turned out for the
festivities honoring North.
   North's mother, Ann, who lives in the Albany suburb of
Guilderland, would not comment on the verdict.
   Government superiors had to know what North was doing, said
Rebecca Bonesteel, who walked down Philmont's sunny main street
with her two sons.
   ``I thought he was not exactly innocent of the things he was
doing, but I think he was acting on orders from a higher authority,
'' Bonesteel said.
   ``I think they ought to let him forget about it,'' said Ralph
Hoag, who said he was a year ahead of North at Philmont High
School. ``He was a good kid then. I still like him.''
   Not everyone was behind the hometown boy. One woman, who refused
to give her name, said she'd gotten into tiffs with friends and
neighbors over North, who she said belongs in jail.
   Joseph Krein, pausing for a soda at a local convenience store,
said he was disgusted with the verdict.
   ``It almost looks like they had to nail him with something,''
Krein said. ``If he had gotten off scot-free, it would have been
too obvious. I think they're just going to slap his wrist.''
   But Krein added: ``I don't think he was a hero. Sure he did what
he was told, but didn't he have a conscience?''

   The jurors in the Oliver North trial did a
``lot of bickering and arguing'' but finally agreed to convict the
former White House aide on three counts after a ``strong prayer,''
one juror said Thursday.
   ``It was tough to come up with a decision,'' Earl F. Williams
told reporters.
   North was convicted of altering and shredding documents and of
two other charges in the Iran-Contra affair. He was acquitted on
nine other counts.
   Most of the jurors declined to discuss the deliberations, saying
they were tired and wanted time with their families. The jury had
been sequestered since April 20.
   Juror Justine Newell Parrish said that reaching a verdict was
the hardest decision she ever had to make.
   Now, she said, ``I just want to be with my family.''
   ``I'm going to take my shower and catch the next flight out of
here to Jamaica,'' said juror Jean Johnson.
   Williams, a former security guard, said the jury did not agree
on the guilty counts until Thursday, the 12th day of deliberations,
although some of the acquittals had been decided earlier.
   ``The jury was split a while on some of the counts, and in a
case such as this there is a lot of bickering and arguing,'' he
said.
   ``It was touch and go all the way,'' he said.
   ``But,'' he added, ``with God's help we prayed a lot and made a
decision.''
   Williams said the breaking point came Thursday when one of the
jurors said ``a strong prayer and it seemed to get everybody
together and we came to a decision.''
   The juror said North was a credible witness. ``I believed him,''
he said. ``No, I don't think he should go to jail.''
   North, who was at the center of the secret Reagan administration
effort to aid the Nicaraguan Contras, could face up to 10 years in
prison on the convictions.
   The jury included nine women and three men.
   Williams said the female jurors, ``were really set in their
ways, but after prayer, a little consideration and friendly talking
they came right in with us.'' But he did not say if they wanted to
acquit or convict North.
   Williams said another reason the jurors took as long as they did
was because of the numerous documents.
   There were no dominant characters on the jury, Williams said.
``We were all pretty strong...it was touch and go...at one time
this person might be a little strong and another time that person
might be a little strong.''
   In general, said Williams, the experience ``wasn't a bad
situation, but it was a trying experience and I wouldn't want to go
through it again.''

<TEXT>
   The governing coalition's presidential
candidate pledged Thursday in the country's last major pre-election
rally to seek an end to disputes with the United States.
   Candidate Carlos Duque told more than 100,000 people that the
solution to U.S.-Panama problems ``would have to be based on mutual
respect and without impositions.''
   For the past several days U.S. officials, including President
Bush, have claimed that Panama's government is planning massive
electoral fraud in Sunday's balloting. So has a vocal oppositon,
which says there can be no democratization in Panama as long as
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega remains head of the nation's Defense
Forces.
   Duque, 59, is a Noriega business associate. Ramon Sieriro,
candidate for first vice president for the eight-party Coalition
for National Liberation, is Noriega's brother-in-law.
   The United States says it wants Noriega out. He was indicted
last year on charges of drug smuggling and money laundering by a
U.S. federal grand jury in Miami.
   Nearly 1.2 million voters are registered to vote in Sunday's
election.
   ``We are the only ones who can unite all of the social forces of
the country,'' Duque told the crowd as he invoked the memory of the
late populist dictator Omar Torrijos, who signed the treaty that
gives Panama total control of the Panama Canal in the year 2000.
   ``We are the only ones who can speak with all members of the
international community,'' he added, referring to Noriega's
connections with governments that are not on friendly terms with
the United States.
   Public employees were given the afternoon off to attend the
pro-government gathering, the last massive campaign rally before
the second presidential election in 21 years.
   Tens of thousands of opposition supporters gathered Wednesday
for their final rally in support of their presidential candidate,
Guillermo Endara.
   Pro-government parties accuse the opposition of having accepted
$10 million in foreign backing for the campaign.
   ``They know they have lost already and that is why they are
yelling fraud,'' Duque said in a speech Tuesday.
   Noriega claims the United States wants to oust him because he
opposes U.S. plans to maintain its Southern Command military
installations in Panama beyond the year 2000 and because it wants
to renege on the canal treaties.
   The anti-U.S. rhetoric of the government-controlled media has
increased in the past few days, and the government prohibited the
broadcasting of Voice of America programs.
   Both the government and the opposition have called on their
followers to go out into the streets to defend the vote.
   After Noriega was indicted, then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle
tried to oust him. Noriega in turn forced out Delvalle.
   In addition to choosing a new president Sunday, voters will
elect two vice presidents, 67 national legislators and 510 precinct
representatives.
   The newspaper La Estrella on Thursday ran an editorial asking
the U.S. government to ``lessen its political pressures over Panama
which has been a loyal partner in the operation of the Canal.''
   The government banned Voice of America programs on local radio.
   The first international observers of the election began
arriving. The government has invited observers from Latin America,
Europe and Asia, but refused to give visas to any official U.S.
delegation.
   However, it invited former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford. They will head a non-official group of observers from the
Council of Freely-elected Heads of Government.
   The government also has prevented some journalists from entering
Panama. Spanish journalists here Wednesday sent a letter to the
Defense Forces protesting the denial of visa to Joaquin Ibarz of
Vanguardia of Barcelona.

<HEAD>Police Chief Daryl Gates Withdraws From Governor's Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Chief Daryl Gates will not seek the
GOP nomination in the 1990 governor's race, saying on Thursday he
lacked support from Republicans and conservatives.
   Gates, 62, had announced three months ago that he was forming an
exploratory committee to consider a gubernatorial candidacy and
test his political support. He said he would not actively campaign
and but would continue as police chief.
   But he found he trailed far behind U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the
Republican front-runner, and former Baseball Commissioner Peter
Ueberroth, who also has strong statewide recognition and has been
mentioned as a possible GOP candidate.
   The chief could not be reached immediately by telephone,
although his secretary confirmed that he had decided to quit.
   In an interview with KNBC-TV, Gates cited his lack of support
among conservatives and Republican party regulars as reasons to
pull out. He also said that his outspokenness worked against him.
   He said he believes a political candidate should be ``willing to
put his political career, his reputation on the block and go
forward with an issue because he believes in that issue. And we
don't have that.''
   Gates was booed April 1 in Orange County during his address at
the annual meeting of the California Republican Assembly, an
influential grass-roots conservative group.
   Members of the audience complained stridently that Gates had
condoned police officers' rough treatment during arrests of
anti-abortion protesters in Los Angeles a week earlier.
   Gates said no other statewide elective offices interest him, and
he plans to remain police chief.
   ``I think that the Chief of Police of Los Angeles can have more
influence than any other statewide official, except the governor,''
Gates said.

<HEAD>`Nuclear Winter' and Ocean Chemists to Receive Environmental Prize</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EDT.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist who helped develop the theory
that nuclear war could plunge Earth into a ``nuclear winter'' and a
chemist who pioneered studies of ocean pollutants have been named
winners of the 1989 Tyler Prize.
   The prize for environmental achievement will be awarded Friday
night to Paul Crutzen, director of atmospheric chemistry at West
Germany's Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, and Edward Goldberg,
of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., the
prize committee announced.
   They will split the $150,000 prize money and receive gold
medallions.
   The group credited Crutzen with important discoveries about
depletion of Earth's protective high-altitude ozone layer, the
formation of ozone as a pollutant at lower altitudes, the ``nuclear
winter'' theory and ``humanity's capacity to upset the global
atmosphere.''
   Crutzen's research indicating the ozone layer could be harmed by
nitrogen oxide pollutants played a role in the debate over
supersonic transport aircraft in the 1970s. It also helped lead to
later discoveries that refrigerant gases called chlorofluorocarbons
were damaging Earth's ozone shield, the prize committee said.
   In 1982, Crutzen and scientist John Birks published a paper,
``The Atmosphere After a Nuclear War: Twilight at Noon,'' in which
they hypothesized that fires from nuclear warfare would blanket
Earth with smoke, blocking enough sunlight to damage food crops.
   The prize committee said it was the fundamental paper that led
another group of scientists to coin the term ``nuclear winter'' and
demonstrate that nuclear war could temporarily plunge the planet
into freezing temperatures and cause mass starvation of survivors.
   Goldberg, a chemistry professor at Scripps, dedicated much of
his career to monitoring and finding solutions to ocean pollution,
the Tyler committee said.
   He helped get toxic tributyl tin boat paints banned in
California, started the Mussel Watch program to monitor ocean
pollutant levels by measuring toxic contaminants in oysters and
mussels, and pioneered ocean pollution research on the insecticide
DDT, radioactive substances, heavy metals and hydrocarbons.
   The committee also said Goldberg has pushed for using the oceans
as safe dumping grounds for non-toxic waste to reduce air and
groundwater pollution due to waste burning and landfill disposal.
   The Tyler Prize, administered by the University of Southern
California, was established in 1973 by Alice C. Tyler and her
husband, the late John C. Tyler, founder of Farmers Insurance Group.

   Actor Douglass Watson, who played Mackenzie
Cory on the NBC soap opera ``Another World,'' has died from a heart
attack, the network announced. He was 67.
   Watson was vacationing in Arizona when he died Monday in Tucson.
NBC said his last appearance as the powerful publishing magnate in
``Another World'' will be broadcast on Wednesday.
   The role, which Watson played for nearly 15 years, earned him
Emmy Awards in 1980 and 1981 as the outstanding actor in a daytime
series.
   ``I don't watch the show,'' Watson said in a 1984 interview.
``Ijust get so embarrassed when I see myself.''
   Watson, who won the Distinguished Flying Cross and two Purple
Hearts for his service in the Air Force in World War II, appeared
in more than 30 Broadway plays, including the title role in T.S.
Elliot's ``Confidential Clerk.''
   His theater credits included ``Over Here'' with the Andrew
Sisters, ``Wisteria Trees'' with Helen Hayes, ``Romeo and Juliet''
with Olivia de Havilland and ``Glass Clock'' with Ruth Gordon.
   He was awarded a New York Drama Desk award in 1974 for his
portrayal of Don Pedro in Shakespeare's ``Much Ado About Nothing.''
   He also was seen in such films as ``Sayonara'' and ``Julius
Caesar'' with Marlon Brando, ``Ulzana's Raid'' with Burt Lancaster
and ``The Money Pit'' with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long.
   Watson is survived by his wife, Eugenia Laring-Clark, and three
children.

<TEXT>
   An Australian aborigine at the center
of a manhunt that sparked a public uproar was arrested with a
hostage on the Queensland Gold Coast after a 10-day sweep across
three states, police said Thursday.
   John Porter, captured late Wednesday, was the key suspect in the
shooting and wounding of two Sydney policemen during an attempted
car theft on April 24.
   One of the policemen allegedly shot by Porter, 26-year-old Alan
McQueen, died Friday morning despite emergency surgery in which
doctors removed a lung, a kidney and most of his liver.
   The manhunt for Porter led to a dawn raid on a surburban Sydney
home last week in which an unarmed aborigine was fatally shot,
sparking an outcry among Australians over the rough treatment of
aborigines.
   Aboriginal activists responded to the killing of David Gundy by
putting posters up around the city calling for the murder of Ted
Pickering, police minister of New South Wales state.
   They also demanded a royal commission _ the highest form of
inquiry available _ into police conduct.
   Aborigines, who number about 160,000 or 1 per cent of the 16
million population, also are angered by the slow progress of a
government inquiry into more than 100 aboriginal deaths in police
custody since 1980.
   Police conduct during the manhunt for Porter captured front-page
headlines after authorities admitted that Queensland police faked
an arrest, watched it reported on the evening television news and
then told the media it was a hoax.
   Police said Thursday that Porter, 27, recently was released from
jail on parole and said he had six other criminal convictions on
drugs and assault charges.
   Police said Porter tried Wednesday to kidnap a woman, but she
escaped and alerted police.
   They said Porter, who was armed with a .32-calber pistol,
surrendered quietly when surrounded outside an apartment block on
the famed coastal strip of northeast Australia.
   Police said he apparently took a man hostage after driving north
from Sydney. The hostage was not injured.
   Porter was charged at the Brisbane Magistrate's court with
kidnapping, grievous bodily harm and use of an unlicensed firearm.

   CBS News said Thursday it is
disturbed by revelations that sheriff's deputies impersonated
members of its staff and will have an attorney contact the Kootenai
County sheriff.
   Undercover Kootenai County deputies posed as members of a CBS
crew in March in Napa, Calif., and another deputy claimed he was a
Montana reporter at a Seattle rally in April, Sheriff Pierce Clegg
acknowledged this week.
   He said he has since adopted a policy against using such covers,
but can't promise it will never happen again. Clegg was unavailable
for comment Thursday, said his secretary, Marlee Aurora.
   ``We do understand the situation it puts you (reporters) in,''
Clegg said earlier this week. ``It would be stupid of me to say it
will never happen again because rules are made to be broken, but
it's not our intention to get information that way.''
   Clegg said both undercover operations were to gather information
on people expected to attend or counterdemonstrate at a
white-supremacist convention that took place in the county April
21-23.
   Deputy Capt. Tom Dickson conceded that he identified himself as
a reporter for the Missoulian in Montana on April 15 when
approached by a member of the Seattle Non-Violent Action Group.
Dickson was videotaping participants at a rally to counter the
skinhead convention the next week.
   Clegg also confirmed that a month earlier two of his deputies
posed as members of a CBS crew to videotape protesters and
neo-Nazis at a Napa, Calif., skinhead gathering. They were acting
officially along with members of a Southern California law
enforcement agency Clegg declined to identify.
   The Missoulian filed objections with Clegg over the April
incident, and CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman in New York said
Wednesday the network had not been able to reach Clegg yet about
the March 4 incident in California.
   Thursday, Goodman said CBS ``will seek assurances from
appropriate law enforcement officials in Kootenai County that these
actions will not be repeated.''
   He said a CBS lawyer will contact Clegg, possibly Friday.

<HEAD>INS Arrests Nine In Alleged Immigrant Smuggling Rings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An undercover investigation into the
smuggling of Chinese aliens into the United States led to nine
arrests and gave officials a rare glimpse into how such operations
work, federal authorities said Thursday.
   ``Over the course of the last few months we've learned more
about smuggling than we have in the last 200 years,'' Benedict
Ferro, Buffalo district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said Thursday.
   The investigation was one of the few to penetrate beyond the
``transporter'' level to the level of those who actually arrange
the transactions, ``(Arrangers) are at the level above the actual
smuggler himself,'' Ferro said.
   Two arrangers, at least three illegal aliens brought into the
country by the ring and 20 other people thought to be illegal
aliens were arrested Wednesday in restaurants in New York City's
Chinatown section, Ferro said.
   Three illegal aliens also were arrested in Toronto earlier in
the week by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and another was arrested
last week by INS agents in Albany.
   Three people who were indicted for conspiring to violate U.S.
immigration laws were being sought along with two other reputed
smugglers, Ferro said.
   He said the smuggling rings transported Chinese nationals from
Hong Kong to Vancouver to Toronto and had links to organized crime
in China. Aliens were then transported across the Niagara River,
which forms the boundary between the United States and Canada, and
eventually to Chinatown.
   ``I would estimate that those nine arrangers have been
responsible for hundreds of Chinese being smuggled though these
routes,'' said Ferro.
   Buffalo investigators began their investigation a year ago when
a smuggler arrested by INS agents agreed to cooperate. The
informant introduced agents to the Toronto end of the smuggling
rings, which undercover agents infiltrated.
   The agents then became transporters, agreeing to move aliens
across one of four international bridges linking the United States
and Canada.
   Canada is a favored port of entry to North America because Hong
Kong residents don't need a visa to visit Canada, officials said.
   The investigation turned up ``arrangers previously on the
sideline who we had not identified, roots we hadn't identified in
the past, meeting places and safe houses _ the kinds of things we
don't get being outside the organization,'' he said.
   Agents learned of elaborate smuggling contracts which controlled
the whole process from China to New York City, Ferro said. The cost
of the trip to aliens was usually about $20,000.
   ``They signed contracts which included such things as the
posting of bail should they get caught,'' he said.
   Once in Chinatown, those who are smuggled into the country often
work many years for low wages in restaurants and ``sweatshops'' to
pay back the cost of the trip.
   More ominously, Ferro said, the illegal aliens find themselves
``financially over their heads'' and are forced to be involved in
criminal activities as a way of repaying the debt.
   ``Very often these gangs (in Chinatown) are made up of people
who are forced to perform in the gangs,'' he said.
   ``These are clearly the people we were trying to get,'' said
Ferro of the arrests. ``There are some significant aspects of
Chinese smuggling that the arrests of these people will address.''
   Two of those arrested, Tin Seong Hui and William Tsoi, both of
Manhattan, were accused of arranging the trips in a warrant issued
by U.S. District Court Judge John T. Curtin in Buffalo.
   Most of those arrested were charged with conspiracy to transport
illegal aliens, which Ferro said is punishable by fines up to
$250,000 and five years in jail.

<TEXT>
   A veteran federal mediator plans to meet
with negotiators for striking miners and Virginia's largest coal
company on Friday and Saturday in an effort to break a two-year
deadlock in contract talks.
   Pittston Coal Group, however, has refused the United Mine
Workers' offer to suspend picketing and demonstrations if the
company stops mining operations during a seven-day cooling-off
period.
   In response, miners on Thursday resumed civil disobedience
tactics that have resulted in 1,290 arrests outside Pittston
operations in southwest Virginia since the strike began April 5.
   ``I'm keeping my fingers crossed on this,'' Ted Chaskelson,
legal counsel for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service,
said from his Washington office.
   The agency, a wing of the U.S. Labor Department, assigned the
case to Joe Kirkham of Louisville, who has mediated labor disputes
for 28 years.
   Kirkham is planning to meet with the UMW negotiating team Friday
and the company representatives Saturday before getting them
together next week. Times and sites had not been decided late
Thursday.
   The strike, which began April 5, affects about 1,500 miners in
Virginia and West Virginia. Two hundred other union miners working
at Pittston operations in Kentucky have not yet left their jobs.
   For the most part, the demonstrations have been non-violent and
the charges limited to obstructing free passage, a misdemeanor.
   On Tuesday, however, seven miners and two contract drivers for
the company were injured when miners pelted the trucks with rocks
and the drivers plowed into demonstrators.
   State police Thursday arrested 21 striking miners for blocking
the entrance to a Pittston mine and processing plant at McClure. In
separate incidents later in the day, they arrested 14 miners for
throwing rocks at coal trucks, Lt. J.B. Willis said.
   Nonetheless, both sides said they were cautiously optimistic
that the federal mediation would help settle the strike.

<HEAD>New Report of South African Bid for Missile Secrets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa offered up to $17 million for secrets
of a British missile manufactured in Northern Ireland, Independent
Television News said Thursday.
   ITN said the offer was made to pro-British Protestant
paramilitary groups for the new surface-to-air Starstreak missile,
in return for cash or arms.
   Rae Killen, South Africa's ambassador in London, said on the
evening news program he doubted very much if money was offered for
Starstreak secrets.
   ``I would hope that no action is taken that would cause problems
to our ... (British-South African) relations,'' he said.
   The Starstreak, not yet fully developed, is scheduled to upgrade
British air defenses in the 1990s.
   Neither Protestant extremist sources nor the Northern Ireland
police had any immediate comment on the report.
   Starstreak, made at Short Brothers factory in Belfast, was top
of the South Africans' shopping list, according to the program,
which quoted sources in the province's Protestant majority.
   Protestant extremists have tried to counter the outlawed Irish
Republican Army's struggle to end British rule and unite the
province with the Irish Republic.
   The ITN report said a man from Northern Ireland living in South
Africa approached Protestant paramilitaries in 1985 and suggested
that a request for arms would be received sympathetically. It said
one official of such a group spent two weeks in South Africa
inspecting weapons in 1985.
   The program said the group could not afford the asking price of
$312,500, so the South Africans suggested an exchange of missile
parts for a delivery to Northern Ireland of illegal weapons.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe complained last month to Barend Du Plessis, the
visiting South African finance minister, about alleged attempts to
steal missile secrets.
   Howe said Britain would view seriously any support by any
government ``for those engaged in violence in the United Kingdom,''
the Foreign Office said.
   Published reports in Britain said South Africa supplied arms to
Protestant groups in January 1988 in return for blueprints of
Blowpipe, a shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile made at Short
Brothers, and also for a cash payment of $255,000.
   Three South African officials implicated in the Blowpipe case
were ordered last week to leave France.
   The Federal Prosecutor's Office in Switzerland is investigating
allegations that an American with an office in Geneva was involved.

<HEAD>Report 86 Die in Angolan Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting between government forces and
UNITA rebels has killed 86 people in Angola since late April, the
Angolan news agency ANGOP reported Thursday.
   The report from the Angolan capital of Luanda, monitored in
Lisbon, said most of the deaths came in fighting in Huambo, Bie and
Lunda Sul provinces.
   ANGOP said 37 guerrillas, six soldiers and 25 civilians died in
a government offensive against rebel positions in the three central
provinces.
   Eleven other civilians were killed in a rebel attack on a
village in Huambo on April 28, ANGOP said.
   The agency reported that a rebel attack killed three civilians
in Bula Atumba town in northern Kuanza Norte province, about 110
miles east of Luanda, and that four other non-combatants were
killed when a mine destroyed a vehicle in Kuanza Norte on April 28.
   It said that 426 civilians who had been held captive by UNITA _
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ were
released and reported to government authorities between April 26
and May 3.
   Six armed and uniformed guerrillas gave up to authorities at the
same time, it said.
   ANGOP said 97 Angolans accused of aiding rebels were freed
Wednesday under terms of a government amnesty.
   UNITA has fought to force the Marxist-orientated Luanda
government to share power since shortly after Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The United States supports UNITA and the Soviet Union backs the
Angolan government.

   Holy copyright, Batman!
   Warner Communications wants the city of Las Cruces to stop using
the Batmobile name and Batman logo on its Breath Analyzing Testing
van used to test suspected drunken drivers.
   Warner owns DC Comics, which has the copyright to the Batman
character, a costumed crime-fighting super hero in mythical Gotham
City who drives a customized Batmobile.
   Police Chief Ron Axtell said the Batmobile is a tribute to the
comic book hero and is not exploitative.
   ``After all, we are all crime fighters,'' he said. ``But if they
want to pursue this, then we can do something else with the B.A.T.''
   ``They may be correct technically about the logo and the name,''
said Assistant City Attorney Marcy Driggers. ``But frankly, I don't
think that we are infringing. The purpose of a copyright is to
protect the company from merchandising, but the city is not making
money on our Batmobile.''
   Don't anybody tell Warner, but Las Cruces isn't the only New
Mexico city with a Batmobile.
   Santa Fe police Lt. Gilbert Ulibarri said Warner has not
contacted his department about its Batmobile.
   The Albuquerque Police Department has two Batmobiles, according
to the city's traffic department.

   Atlantis' astronauts, safely in
orbit after a cliff-hanger weather delay, sent the Magellan
spacecraft streaking across the solar system Thursday night on a
$550 million mapmaking mission to Venus.
   The robot spacecraft, reviving an American planetary-science
program dormant for a decade, slipped from the shuttle's cargo bay
at 9:01 p.m. EDT and drifted into space.
   ``Magellan is deployed,'' reported shuttle commander David
Walker.
   An hour later, after Atlantis moved a safe distance away, both
stages of a spacecraft motor fired to start Magellan on a 456-day
journey to Venus, 158 million miles away. It will travel 806
million miles, looping 1{ times around the sun, before reaching and
orbiting its target in August 1990.
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
Magellan's mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
Walker replied when told both stages had fired.
   Minutes later Mission Control reported:
   ``Magellan is coming to life and is on a proper path toward
Venus, falling toward the sun.''
   Mission specialists Mark Lee and Mary Cleave, operating remote
controls inside the shuttle cabin, checked the health of the space
probe before sending a signal that spring-ejected it into its own
orbit while Atlantis soared over the Pacific Ocean 600 miles
southwest of Los Angeles.
   Magellan, the first planetary craft ever launched from a
shuttle, is to map up to 90 percent of Venus' cloud-shrouded
surface. Its high-resolution radar system is expected to produce
images of objects as small as a football field _ 10 times the
clarity of any previous pictures of the mysterious planet.
   The release of Magellan, the main task of the four-day flight,
came a little more than six hours after Atlantis thundered into
orbit 184 miles high.
   The launch was delayed 59 minutes by shifting clouds and winds
that had threatened the second postponement in six days. When
Atlantis finally left its pad, just five minutes remained in the
launch ``window'' dictated by the need to have the shuttle in the
proper position to dispatch Magellan to Venus.
   The launch team had advanced the countdown to the 5-minute mark
and held there, waiting for a break in the clouds that obscured a
runway near the launch pad where Atlantis would land in an
emergency.
   Chief astronaut Dan Brandenstein, flying a weather scout plane,
found a break, signaled the go-ahead, and the count was started and
carried down to the blazing liftoff.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger. I'm glad you stuck with it,''
acting NASA administrator Dale D. Myers said as he congratulated
the launch team.
   It was the 60th U.S. man-in-space flight, the 29th for the
shuttle and the fourth since the Challenger explosion more than
three years ago.
   ``Four of us are very happy to be back in space, and the fifth
one is very happy to be here,'' radioed Walker.
   Walker, pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialists Cleave and
Norman Thagard flew on previous shuttle flights. Lee is a rookie.
   ``Did somebody win the pool up there?'' mission control
commentator John Creighton asked the crew. ``We had only five
minutes left in the window.''
   ``We wouldn't want to push it any closer,'' replied Walker.
   The commander also reported Atlantis' separation from its
external fuel tank as it entered orbit was rougher than he
remembered on his first shuttle flight.
   ``It was more violent _ although I hate to use that word,'' he
said. ``It wasn't the soft separation I remembered from the
previous flight.''
   A launch attempt last Friday was halted with just 31 seconds to
go because of a short circuit in an engine fuel pump. Technicians
worked around the clock over the weekend to replace the pump and a
fuel line. NASA had to launch Magellan by May 28 or ground it for
two years until Earth and Venus were again in the proper alignment.
   Among tens of thousands who watched the rare afternoon liftoff
were some of the country's most renowned planetary scientists. They
have been waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978,
when Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last U.S. planetary
expedition.
   Success for Magellan would signal the start of a science-rich
three-year period during which five major probes will be rocketed
into space.
   ``The overture, the symphony, begins with Magellan,'' said NASA
science chief Lennard Fisk. ``It's going to be a long symphony.
It's going to have a lot of crescendos ... Nobody is going to
question our leadership in planetary science again.''
   Fisk hailed Magellan's flight as the start of a ``second golden
age'' of space science. The first was the period from the mid-1960s
to the late-1970s when unmanned spacecraft for the first time were
launched to make closeup examinations of Venus, Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   Looking ahead, Fisk said that in August the Voyager 2 spacecraft
launched in 1977 will take the first close look at Neptune after a
planetary odyssey that earlier took it near Jupiter, Saturn and
Uranus.
   In October, another Atlantis crew is to start the Galileo probe
on its way to Jupiter, the Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, Ulysses is to orbit the sun
in October 1990 and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in 1992 on an unmanned rocket.
   The planetary program had languished for 11 years because of a
combination of NASA budget cuts and the Challenger explosion that
delayed most of these missions more than three years.
   When Magellan reaches Venus in August 1990, it is to fire into
orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist.
   The radar is designed to pierce Venus sulfuric acid clouds and
produce images showing features as small as 100 yards across, the
size of a football field. In comparison, two 1983 Soviet spacecraft
captured features about 1,200 yards across and the 1978
Pioneer-Venus could not distinguish anything smaller than 60 miles
across.
   ``Everything we have learned about planetary science says that
Venus is the planet most like Earth,'' Saunders said. ``A major
question is why Earth and Venus evolved so differently even though
at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical.''
   The surface temperature of Earth's sultry twin is 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure
is 90 times greater than that on Earth.
   The atmosphere of Venus is composed mostly of carbon dioxide,
and the upper clouds, which hide the planet from view, are made up
of sulfuric acid droplets. Earlier exploration by unmanned
spacecraft have revealed continent-sized plateaus, deep canyons and
one of the highest mountains in the solar system.
   Saunders said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
Venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on Earth.

   The would-be novels began badly and
turned worse before their first sentences thudded to an end,
laughable tributes to a once popular Victorian master of banality
and gratuitous polysyllabic prose.
   And those were the winners!
   The 8th International Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, sponsored
by the San Jose State University English department, unleashed its,
uh, best entries Thursday from ``the seamy underside of
literature.''
   The grand prize from the nearly 10,000 execrable entries from
around the world went to Ray C. Gainey of Indianapolis for this bit
of amusing, albeit repulsive, imagery:
   ``Professor Frobisher couldn't believe he had missed seeing it
for so long _ it was, after all, right there under his nose _ but
in all his years of research into the intricate and mysterious ways
of the universe, he had never noticed that the freckles on his
upper lip, just below and to the left of the nostril, partially
hidden until now by the hairy mole he had just removed a week
before, exactly matched the pattern of the stars in the Pleiades,
down to the angry red zit that had just popped up where he and his
colleagues had only today discovered an exploding nova.''
   For his effort, Gainey gained a word processor, confirming the
computer age adage, ``Garbage in, garbage out.''
   ``My wife was jumping up and down when she called me at work,''
said Gainey in a telephone interview. ``They dragged me out of a
meeting. I thought somebody was dead.''
   Gainey, who enters as many as 30 items a year, said he won
dishonorable mentions in 1985, 1986 and 1987.
   The contest, founded by English professor Scott Rice, honors, as
it were, Edward George Bulwer-Lytton.
   Rice describes Lytton as the ``author of some of Victorian
literature's most turgid prose'' and notes that the ponderous,
meandering opening sentence to his novel, ``Paul Clifford,'' which
began, ``It was a dark and stormy night ...'' inspired not only the
contest but the famous literary beagle, Snoopy.
   The contest, which Rice calls ``a sneaky but enjoyable way to
encourage writing,'' invites insipid inkslingers to offer opening
sentences to the worst possible hypothetical novels.
   ``As anyone who has spent time on an entry knows, it takes a
good writer to write bad deliberately,'' Rice says.
   Here, then, are some of the deliberately bad winners, the creme
da dreck, in various genres:
   Detective Fiction _ ``Sgt. Tom Katt wasn't 100 percent sure of
anything but he knew something wasn't quite right when the factory
foreman told him that the nightshift guard had fallen into a vat of
baby oil and softened to death.'' _ Wayne D. Worthey, Washington,
D.C.
   Historical _ ```Rumbling, Schmumbling!' retorted Bulonius to his
wife's alarm at the sounds coming from Mt. Vesuvius, `that stupid
volcano always makes noise _ and besides, our insurance agent at
Pompeii Mutual says that if it does erupt we'll be covered.''' _
John L. Ashman, Houston.
   Vile Puns _ ``As Wilbur, long obsessed though unfamiliar with
pointilism, escorted his wife, Katy, into the Modern wing of the
local art museum, he exclaimed jubilantly, `Kay, Seurat!, Seurat!,'
to which she replied, yawningly, `Whatever, Wilby, Wilby.' '' _
Matthew Kaslow, Brooklyn, N.Y.
   Western _ ``Sheriff Blalock groped for his shooting iron, as the
thought that he was up for re-election crossed his mind, because he
wasn't going to let this varmint get away with insulting Miss
Beulah's girls, even if they did kind of resemble a string of
horses that had been rode hard and put away wet.'' _ Lucile R.
Addington, Dallas.
   Romance _ ``Jake liked his women the way he liked his kiwi
fruit: sweet yet tart, firm-fleshed yet yielding to the touch, and
covered with short brown fuzzy hair.'' _ Gretchen Schmidt, Coral
Gables, Fla.
   Adventure _ ``It was the third day of the Iditarod sled race,
and a frigid wind blew ice crystals into Preston's grizzled,
windburned face as he urged his dogs on: `Mush! Let's go, Jason,
Jennifer, Jeremy! Move it out, Chelsea, Brian! Come on, Buffy,
Muffy! Mush!'' _ Michael J. Saxton, Davis, Calif.

   Margaret Thatcher celebrated her 10th anniversary
in power Thursday, declaring she has transformed Britain, but she
apparently lost a previously safe Welsh parliamentary district to
socialists.
   In Northern Ireland, the Irish Republican Army, which has vowed
to assassinate Mrs. Thatcher, killed a British soldier and said the
bomb attack was a 10th anniversary reminder that ``the Irish
question remains unresolved.''
   Mrs. Thatcher escaped injury in 1984 when the outlawed IRA blew
up her hotel in Brighton, England, killing five members of her
Conservative Party. The IRA warned her afterward, ``We only have to
be lucky once. You have to be lucky always.''
   Former President Reagan telephoned anniversary congratulations
Thursday from California, an aide said. The Reagans plan to visit
London next month.
   Soviet TV gave her a mixed review. It said she had been able to
``noticeably raise the international authority of England'' and
inject a new dynamism into the economy, but had done so at the
expense of British workers.
   Leaders of the main opposition Labor Party were particularly
delighted Thursday at their apparent win in the Vale of Glamorgan,
a largely rural Welsh district, declaring they were on their way
back to power after a decade in the shadows.
   The Conservatives held the parliamentary seat for 38 years.
Thursday's special election was caused by the death of the previous
legislator.
   Pre-election polls predicted a Tory loss. This partly reflected
opposition to an overhaul of the free National Health Service _
among the latest targets of Mrs. Thatcher's right-wing revolution.
   In separate county council elections in England and Wales, both
Conservatives and Labor made substantial gains, largely at the
expense of the two squabbling center parties _ the Social and
Liberal Democratic Party and the the smaller Social Democratic
Party.
   With results declared early Friday from 40 of the 47 county
councils, the Conservatives had overall control of 14, up from
seven, and Labor had overall control of 12, including four new
gains.
   The Social and Liberal Democratic Party kept control of its
district, the Isle of Wight, in county council elections but lost
seats across the country.
   Of the remaining councils declared, no party had overall control
in 11 and two were controlled by independents.
   Speaking to reporters on the steps of her 10 Downing St. office
Thursday morning, Mrs. Thatcher said ``Britain has been
transformed'' since she ousted James Callaghan's Labor Party
government and took office May 4, 1979.
   ``The standard of living for almost everyone is higher and ... I
think everyone recognizes that Britain's standing in the world is
greater than it's been for many a very long year,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 63, swept to power on a wave of anti-union
sentiment after a winter of strikes left garbage piled across the
country, hospitals turning away the sick and the dead unburied.
   Europe's first woman prime minister since has won two more
elections. She is the longest continuously serving British prime
minister this century and is expected to run for a fourth term.
   She gave no hint when she might go, saying, ``There's no thought
of slowing down.''
   Mrs. Thatcher cut an anniversary cake in the House of Commons
and was guest of honor at a Downing Street dinner Thursday given by
her 21 Cabinet colleagues. They are all men and only three are
survivors of her first Cabinet.
   Otherwise it was a regular day that included furious exchanges
in the Commons with opposition leader Neil Kinnock, with whom she
has a particularly antagonistic relationship.
   He charged her with failing to fulfill St. Francis of Assisi's
prayer, ``Where there is discord, may we bring harmony,'' which she
quoted on the steps of Downing Street when she moved in.
   Shouting above Labor jeers, Mrs. Thatcher retorted, ``Remember
the discord in the winter of discontent in 1979 when under
socialism ... you couldn't even get the dead buried.''

<TEXT>
   A grand jury has begun investigating
fired tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood for possible felony
violations stemming from his role in the nation's worst oil spill,
sources said Thursday.
   Hazelwood, free on $50,000 bail, already has been ordered to
stand trial June 20 in Valdez on three misdemeanor charges that
include operating a vessel while drunk. He has pleaded innocent.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, arrived Thursday night to
inspect beaches fouled by the spill. Alaska officials were eager to
give him a tour, according to the state's ranking environmental
official at the spill zone.
   ``He's going to see oil and lots of it,'' said Bill Lamoreaux of
the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The beach on
Smith Island, where a wooden viewing platform has been constructed
for Quayle, was among the hardest hit.
   Quayle's government jet touched down about 6:30 p.m. (10:30 EDT)
at Cordova, about 50 miles from the site of the Exxon Valdez tanker
crash. Following the Smith Island stop, he was scheduled to visit
Elmendorf Air Force Base outside Anchorage later for a news
conference.
   Federal Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, Alaska Gov.
Steve Cowper and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost Jr. were expected
to accompany Quayle.
   The grand jury probe is the first indication that Hazelwood, 42,
faces felony charges stemming from the spill March 24, when his
vessel slammed into a reef and poured more than 10 million gallons
of crude into Prince William Sound.
   Sources at the state District Court and the district attorney's
office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the grand jury
was taking testimony on the possibility that Hazelwood committed a
felony in connection with his conduct the night of the spill.
   One source said the probe concerned second-degree criminal
mischief, which carrys a maximum term of five years in prison. For
first offenders, the sentence is often two years or less, with
probation.
   In other developments, Exxon officials Thursday proposed arming
the guards of their cleanup crews with shotguns _ rather than
chemical sprays they're now carrying _ to protect them against the
coastal brown bears.
   But state and federal environmental officials were concerned
that inexperienced guards might shoot the bears needlessly.
   Exxon also launched a public relations offensive Thursday
against critics of its cleanup plan, saying government bureaucracy
has crippled the effort.
   ``It's a comprehensive plan. It's a good plan. It's an
economically sound plan and we're convinced it will work,'' Otto
Harrison, Exxon's executive supervising the cleanup from Valdez,
said in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Exxon President Lee R. Raymond, at a news conference in his New
York offices, denied the company was trying to cut corners in the
cleanup. But he complained that as many as 14 government agencies
may be involved in approving and carrying out the final plan.
   ``I want one person in charge _ I don't care who it is _ because
there has to be one person that finally says, `Hey, it's midnight
and we gotta do something,'' Raymond said. ``Anything reasonable,
anything that makes sense that they would say you ought to do in
addition to what you have in the plan, we'll do it.''
   Raymond also said Exxon is not seeking exemptions from
environmental laws, although the oil company's proposal
specifically calls for ``letters of non-objection, waivers and
permit modifications'' from state and local governments to dispose
of the oil waste at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. terminal in
Valdez.
   Raymond said Yost, who has authority over whether Exxon's
cleanup proposal is approved, was encouraged by Exxon's proposal.
Dennis Hubbard, a spokesman for Yost in Valdez, said the commandant
has not taken a position on the plan.
   Earlier this week, Yost called the plan ``very thin, very light.
There's not a lot of backup subsantiation.''
   Oil from the spill has spread throughout the sound and
contaminated shores more than 525 miles to the southwest, including
the spectacular Katmai National Park, a wildlife refuge.
   Exxon has recommended cleaning 364 miles of Alaska coastline by
mid-September. But the company wants to leave untouched nearly 200
of those miles and let them be cleaned by nature.
   The state, responding to a request from Yost to evaulate Exxon's
revised clean-up plan, rejected the Exxon proposal, saying it was
inadequate and didn't provide for enough personnel to do the job.

the microphone in his blue jeans and flowered shirt, hat pushed
back on his head, and picked out the cords on his banjo.
   He's still singing the same tunes, and has changed little since
the glory days of folk music two decades ago.
   Thousands of those jammed into and around the big tent at the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival knew the words. They stood
and sang without prompting:
   ``Deep in my heart. I do believe. We shall overcome, someday.''
   Abbie Hoffman is dead, Jerry Rubin is part of the establishment,
Jane Fonda is selling exercise tapes, and other activists of the
1960s have either copped out, burned out or dropped out. But the
70-year-old folk singer from Benton, N.Y., is still at it.
   Seeger's songs are the songs he sang for civil rights, to ban
the bomb, to cry out against the war in Vietnam and poverty and to
fight for human rights throughout the world: ``We Shall Overcome,''
``This Land Is Your Land.''
   The audience was made up of those who marched to his tunes
during the turbulent '60s and who think of that era as history.
   ``My records have never sold very well. A thousand copies here,
1,000 copies there. But, probably every elementary school system in
the country has at least one teacher who has at least one of them
and so kids grow up knowing my work,'' Seeger said of his continued
popularity.
   He continues to perform once or twice a week.
   ``I usually sing to small groups _ 100, 200 people. I still have
things to tell them. Nobody in this world knows all the answers.
All we can do is encourage people to hope. I try to do that,'' he
said.
   His values, once the trendy slogans of a generation, have held
up for him. He lists his heroes as those who suffered on the front
lines to bring civil rights to the South and peace to Southeast
Asia.
   Seeger said he's thoroughly respectable now, disgracefully so.
That wasn't always true. At the height of the McCarthy era he was
held in contempt of Congress and banned from television. In 1949,
while marching with the actor, author and singer Paul Robeson,
Seeger was attacked by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Would he rather be remembered for his music or his politics?
Seeger said it doesn't matter. What matters, he said, is what he
can do now:
   ``I've always said that my epitaph will be `He done his
damnedest.'''
   Seeger's second book, ``Everybody Say Freedom,'' written with
Robert Reser, is due out this year. He and Arlo Guthrie may do a
concert together later this year. He is devoted to the Clearwater
project, an effort he organized years ago to help clean up the
polluted Hudson River in New York-New Jersey. He also is working
for world disarmament.
   ``It's one of the most important issues there is,'' he said
   The '60s may not get a curtain call, but Seeger's not the only
one carrying on that tradition.
   ``There are still people who care,'' he said, ``still people who
think they can make things better. As long as that is true in this
country, we're OK. There's an old saying, `Hope is the opiate of
the masses.' I guess I'm still singing about hope. Who knows, if
people listen long enough, it may make them think about more than
the music. Who knows?''

<HEAD>Former National Security Adviser Declares Communism Is Dying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the history of the 20th century is written,
Zbigniew Brzezinski is sure the chapter on communism will read like
an obituary _ so sure that the former White House policy-maker
already has it written.
   ``(There) is no doubt that we are all witnesses to an event of
fundamental importance,'' Brzezinski said in a recent interview
about his new book, ``The Grand Failure: The Birth and Death of
Communism in the Twentieth Century.''
   ``This century to all of us, in different ways, was dominated by
communism. Communism defined the philosophical debate, communism
was the source of the Cold War _ the challenge. And that is now
fading.''
   The book by the former national security adviser to President
Carter has received good reviews and climbed best-seller lists.
   Even President Bush is reading the book, according to
Brzezinski. But the Polish-born scholar, who serves on Bush's
independent Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, wouldn't say how
his views are influencing Bush's long-running foreign policy review.
   The book's popularity attests to the audience for a cogent
explanation of profound changes sweeping the communist world today.
   ``When an ideology ceases to motivate people, when it is
discredited, when it is no longer a source for policy, it is dying,
and that is what is happening. That's a momentous change,'' he said.
   According to Brzezinski, who is credited with helping to
normalize U.S.-Chinese relations in the late 1970s, the failure of
the communist command economy is at the heart of the ideology's
failure.
   He concludes that Soviet communism will wither away, leaving the
country in a decade-long systemic crisis trying to hold itself
together.
   China, with deeper cultural traditions, will evolve into a
non-communist nation whose communist leaders will argue mostly
about the pace of change.
   Reforms in smaller communist nations will vary in their success,
but all will depart from the evidently disastrous socialist path,
Brzezinski writes.
   ``There have been people who've always said (communism) is a
failure,'' he said. But now, the realization is ``pervasive among
the leaders who profess to (guide) communism.''
   To save the Soviet economy, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
has to redefine the party's role in society, the author says. He is
seeking mass support by granting more political and social openness
_ ``glasnost'' _ and restructuring the government to circumvent
conservative leaders. But the reforms are unleashing national
ethnic passions among Russians and non-Russians that threaten to
tear the country apart.
   ``Its economic success can only be purchased at the cost of
political stablility, while its political stability can only be
sustained at the cost of economic failure,'' Brzezinski writes.
   China's reforms have a better chance for success mostly because
of pragmatic leadership and deeper cultural traditions that will
absorb free market reforms more readily. ``Modern China may enter
the 21st century still ruled by communists, but it will not be a
communized China,'' he writes.
   Brzezinski discounts any retrenchment in Beijing's recent
decision to restrict market activities to cool its overheating
economy.
   ``You're going have these zigzags, but it's not a pullback in
any way to the original starting point,'' he said.
   ``It highlights the fact, ultimately, that there is no halfway
house between partial communism and partial free market systems.
And communist systems do find it difficult to make that basic
transition.''
   East European countries will seek greater freedom from Moscow,
he said. The West should encourage their independence without
trying to dismantle the Warsaw Pact and deny Moscow its
``legitimate security interests.''
   Central American radicals may use communism as a rallying point
against ``Americanism expansionism, American indifference, American
clumsiness, and American proximity,'' Brzezinski said.
   ``(But) even in Central America, none of the (revolutionary
leaders), if you asked them, would say, `If we win we want to build
the system like the one the Soviets have.'''
   Communism's demise largely reduces the U.S.-Soviet confrontation
to the military dimension, Brzezinski said. ``The real danger is
that we will confuse the reforms and weakness with disarmament. The
former is happening, the latter has not happened yet.''
   Brzezinski said Moscow has been losing the Cold War. But it has
achieved a ``tepid armistice'' with the United States and could
reassert itself after recovering from domestic problems.
   ``Our job is to translate this armistice into a more lasting and
genuine accommodation,'' Brzezinski said.

<HEAD>Tremendous Vacation Bargains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you had your choice of paying half price for
a time-share unit at a vacation condominium or paying full price
and receiving a $6 watch, which would you take?
   Strange, isn't it, that many people each year pay the full price
and accept the ``free gift,'' when identical units in the same
resort might have no takers at thousands of dollars less.
   The reason, says Clinton Burr, is in the marketing.
   Each year more than 10 million Americans are solicited to attend
sales presentations at full price and receive an inexpensive gift,
he says, while unbeknownst to them existing owners are willing to
sell identical units for less.
   Acting on that knowledge, Burr established the Resort Property
Owners Association. ``Bleeding and starving his family,'' the young
attorney built RPOA into a 17,000-member organization in less than
two years.
   Saturday through Monday he inspects and rates properties for
``Resort Reports,'' his twice-monthly newsletter, and for RPOA
guides to Southeast and Southwest properties. A Northern states
guide will be ready in September.
   Last weekend he toured Cape Cod, Mass.; Newport, R.I.; and the
Maine coast before flying home to record his data and attend to his
law practice. While others bask in luxury, he works, convinced he
is creating an institution.
   Burr seeks to be neutral, a source of unbiased information in an
industry where buyers, sellers and renters have had no basic
information source. Time-sharing will grow, he says, although right
now its reputation is damaged.
   ``It's a great way for families and seniors to vacation,'' he
says. It matters little if they buy, or if they rent from existing
owners, he says, since they can enjoy spaciousness and luxury at
prices within their budgets.
   His reasons: Luxury condos _ resort properties with a convenant
tying them to first-rate facilities such as pools, oceanfront and
golf courses _ are costing too much for the mass market. And the
costs might rise.
   The tax benefits might disappear also. Condo owners now may
deduct their mortgage interest costs; and, if they rent out their
units, they may claim depreciation also. Someday that might end;
Congress is eyeing such deductions.
   With costs high, Burr believes time-sharing, or sharing
ownership of a unit with others, might benefit from such
crackdowns, and he intends to be a factor in it by providing
information similar to today's Mobil Travel Guides.
   Time shares were introduced in the early 1970s as a way for
vacationers to save through partial ownership. It was a way for
resorts to survive; it was a way for ordinary folks to afford
high-class accommodations.
   Then came the high pressure. ``Congratulations, you have won a
free cruise to the Bahamas.'' Or maybe it was a $995 diamond and
sapphire bracelet or a sports watch or a 35mm-camera or diamond
earrings.
   Wholesale, the cruise was worth $25, the bracelet $50, the watch
$6, the camera $5, the earrings _ made of industrial diamond dust _
$2. For this you had to claim your prize in 10 days and present a
credit card number.
   Not all such promotions are phony, but many are. Burr, himself a
time-sharer, knew that a greater flow of unbiased information was
needed if the healthy market he foresaw were to take hold.
   A current report on sales of time-share units is an example.
Sales by resort developers have grown sharply in the past decade,
from an annual sales volume of $281 million in 1978 to about $1.8
billion in 1988.
   Startlingly, however, owners of nearly a half-million time-share
units in the United States have been unable to sell their
properties. For them, the market is a disaster. Even those who
manage to sell often fail to profit.
   At the same time, operators of the very same resorts are selling
identical units at higher prices. The difference: high pressure and
marketing skills.
   To help correct the situation, Burr offers to put individual
time-share sellers in touch with sales organizations if they write
to him at P.O. Box 2395, Northbrook, Ill. 60062, or call him at
(312) 236-5684.
   He says he's happy to provide the service to members and
non-members because he wants to strengthen the market. He'd be even
happier and they would be too, he says, if they joined at $15 a
year.

   The Fox Broadcasting Co. is launching a
once-a-month movie night in preparation for regular prime-time
programming on Monday nights to begin in September.
   The movies begin Monday, May 15, with David Cronenberg's
box-office hit, ``The Fly.''
   ``We really see the movies and the new night of programming as
two separate things,'' said Peter Chernin, new president of the Fox
Entertainment Group. ``Soon after we begin Monday-night
programming, we hope to start a movie night, probably on Tuesday.''
   Other upcoming movies in the Fox lineup include ``Big Trouble in
Little China,'' scheduled to air Monday, June 5; ``Jumpin' Jack
Flash,'' July 10; and ``Mannequin,'' Aug. 28.
   The Tuesday movies will begin Oct. 3 with ``Black Widow,''
followed by ``Predator,'' and ``Revenge of the Nerds, Part II.''
   Meanwhile, Fox is looking at 13 pilots to fill two hours of
prime-time programming on Monday, beginning Sept. 11. Among them
are what would be the first television project from film director
Francis Ford Coppola, based on his movie version S.E. Hinton's
teen-appeal book, ``The Outsiders.''
   ``Our company is solid and the outlook is bullish,'' said
Chernin. ``We're going to put on Monday night then we're going to
get on with the business of programming every night of the week.
   ``I think it's going to be easier going forward now than in the
past. The stations are stronger. When we started Sunday night, we
had no place to promote it. Two years ago the stations may have had
some trepidation, but they've had such success they're ready to
tell us to start programming more nights. Everyone's ratings are
up.''
   Fox Broadcasting lost $90 million last year. But Chernin said
the fledgling network will come close to breaking even this fiscal
year.
   ``There's clearly a good deal of pride and pleasure in how far
we've come in the last year,'' he said.
   Two Fox Sunday shows, ``Married ... With Children'' and
``America's Most Wanted'' often finish ahead of a third of the big
networks' shows in the Nielsen ratings. Plans are now being made to
improve the ratings for Fox's other shows. ``Duet,'' ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show'' and ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' have received
critical praise but scant viewership.
   On Saturday, the addition of the reality-based crime show
``Cops'' has raised the night's ratings significantly. ``It's done
for Saturday night what `America's Most Wanted' did for Sunday
night,'' said Chernin.
   Fox ratings may be considerably lower than the networks', but so
are its expectations. Fox would consider a show with an 8.0 rating
a major success. A network show has to do about a 14.0 to be
considered a keeper. (Each rating point equals 904,000 TV
households.)
   ``I think the shows that work best for us are those that are
attention-getters,'' said Chernin. ``There are numerous ways to get
attention. Quality, being innovative, taking chances and using
special talents. We go after the younger audience and that goes
hand-in-hand because younger viewers are looking for new and
innovative shows.''
   Its take-a-chance attitude has resulted in publicity, for
certain. The raunchy comedy ``Married ... With Children'' drew fire
from a Michigan woman who complained to sponsors who said they
would review its content more carefully in the future. But Fox has
no plans to alter the show, which has sold out its advertising
slots for the season.
   Other comedies under consideration for Monday include ``Let's
Get Mom,'' a domestic comedy starring Carol Kane; a live, half-hour
comedy, ``Bill Gets a Life,'' with comedian Bill Maher as a radio
talk-show host; ``Babes,'' a female buddy show about three rather
large New York sisters; ``Hollywood Dog,'' a comedy combining live
action and animation; and ``Urban Renewal,'' in the tradition of
``Laugh-In'' and ``Saturday Night Live,'' from Keenan Ivory Wayans.
   Besides ``The Outsiders,'' dramas being considered include the
movie spinoff, ``Alien Nation,'' about an alien culture coexisting
with humans and ``Wurlitzer,'' about a young man who discovers an
old jukebox that acts as a time machine.

<TEXT>
   A widely respected television journalist, Bill
Moyers, is in a tussle with fundamentalist officials of his own
denomination, the Southern Baptists, particularly one of them.
   It's a peculiar scrap, and may lead to further rounds.
   ``I've been a Baptist all my life and I'm used to this,'' Moyers
commented. ``They say that where two or more Baptists are gathered
together, there'll be a fight.''
   This one was started by a virtually unheard-of action _ a
formally adopted resolution by a major denomination assailing an
individual journalist. It said Moyers' TV series, ``God and
Politics'' was biased.
   Moyers says, ``Nobody can point to a single frame of that series
and say it's inaccurate.
   ``We tried to be scrupulously fair and with the single exception
of Paul Pressler, the comments we have received from all sides have
underlined that fairness.''
   Pressler, a Houston judge, was the chief strategist for
fundamentalists gaining predominance in the country's biggest
Protestant body, elevating him to its national executive committee.
   There, he pushed through the resolution in February, charging
that the Moyers series supported ``one faction'' _ the moderates _
in a decade-long conflict with the now-ruling fundamentalist camp.
   Charging ``biased content,'' the resolution urged people to
complain to sponsors and the Public Broadcasting System that aired
it more than a year before, in December, 1987.
   ``Why they waited so long is a mystery to me,'' Moyers said in
an interview. ``Pressler now has the committee packed with his
people so he can do whatever he wants.''
   Pressler singled out a part of the series called, ``Battle for
the Bible,'' dealing with the denominational controversy, and
called it prejudiced.
   That show is to be repeated Sunday, May 21, on PBS as part of a
series of Moyers' best documentaries. He notified Pressler of the
re-showing ``in light of your spurious accusations'' and ``so
viewers can once more judge it for themselves.''
   Meyers invited Pressler to appear with him following the program
for a half-hour live discussion to ``say whatever he wants to say,
unedited.''
   However, the executive committee's chairman, the Rev. Charles
Sullivan of Lenoir City, Tenn., replied that Pressler had been
asked not to discuss the matter further publicly until the
committee considered it.
   The committee next meets just before the June 9-16 Southern
Baptist Convention in Las Vegas, Nev. Moyers earlier asked to
appear before it to ``discuss these matters in a Christian
manner.'' But Sullivan also had turned that down, saying there was
no time on the agenda.
   Pressler, at one point, proposed a 90-minute session with him
taped by the denomination's Sunday School Board, provided it was
shown in full on PBS _ something no independent producer could
guarantee.
   Ironically, while the jousting went on, the national convention
of the Religious Public Relations Council, representing
communications officers of most major denominations, presented a
special award to Moyers for his high journalistic standards and
sensitivity to religious values.
   Fundamentalists gained hegemony among the 14.8 million Southern
Baptists through a strategy _ planned by Pressler _ of electing
successive convention presidents to use appointive powers to
restrict personnel to ``biblical inerrantists'' or literalists.
   Baptists, while always honoring the Bible, historically have
resisted any official creed or control of interpretation.
   ``Most Baptists don't realize what's been going on,'' Moyers
said. ``They're too busy doing the Lord's work to pay any attention
to denominational politics.''
   A key element in Pressler's complaint against Moyers was that in
a filmed interview, Moyers changed the questions from those to
which Pressler is shown responding.
   Moyers told Baptist Press: ``Paul Pressler is not telling the
truth.''
   Pressler said that during the interview, the only camera shots
were ``full face of me'' but that Moyers' staff later ``recorded
him asking new questions front face of him.''
   They were ``somewhat similar questions,'' but had ``different
nuances,'' he said. ``And, brother, it is not fair to have...you
appear like you are answering questions that were never asked.''
   Moyers recounted of the interview: ``As I began to ask him
questions about his ties to right-wing politics and the beer man
Joseph Coors, he grew angry and flushed in the face, abruptly stood
up, tore off his microphone, announced the interview was over and
left the room in a huff, all of which we filmed but did not use in
the commentary.
   ``His unexpected departure meant that he was not present when,
as is customary, we reversed the single camera and repeated the
questions which my producer had taken down as the interview
progressed. But the content of the questions was unchanged.
   ``As a matter of professional practice, I do not treat my guests
unfairly; one would not survive in journalism and do so.''

<HEAD>Reflections of the Queen of Soul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUSTIN BURKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Queen of Soul reigned over
her recent birthday party with the aloofness of a true monarch.
   Aretha Franklin watched with detachment while guests dined on
smoked salmon, fresh fruit and chocolate fondue, and danced to the
music of two bands. The furniture had been removed from her
cavernous home in this affluent suburb to accommodate the 300
friends.
   It all resembled a medieval court transported to the 1980s _
dandies in black tie replaced knights in shining armor, and
madrigals gave way to rhythm and blues.
   Looking relatively svelte in a white suit with a black halter
top, the singer often stood alone, surreptitiously puffing a
cigarette. Still shy at 47, Aretha Franklin values privacy.
   ``When I'm at home, I'm just like the lady next door,'' she said
later in an interview. ``I try to leave my act on stage. I do my
share of the dishes when I'm at home. That helps keep my feet on
the ground.''
   Franklin rules over soul music like a personal fiefdom. She's an
icon who has influenced singers from Chaka Khan to Bette Midler.
   She won her 15th Grammy award this year for a collection of
gospel songs, and she is the biggest female Grammy winner in
history. Her albums and singles are multimillion sellers.
   Her home mirrors those achievements. Grammys line the mantel
piece of her office; gold and platinum records cover the walls _
some even sit on the floor because there is no place to hang them.
   But Franklin doesn't use her success to bully those around her.
   ``We didn't have any ego battles,'' said Narada Michael Walden,
producer of ``Who's Zoomin' Who,'' a platinum LP. ``If she had been
on her throne, maybe. But her throne is the people's throne.''
   Her constant quest for perfection is sometimes misinterpreted,
the producer said, giving her the reputation as being difficult.
   ``She works on instinct, on spontaneity,'' Walden said. ``She's
a perfectionist in terms of the feeling of a song, and sometimes
she'll keep doing it until she thinks it's right.''
   Franklin tries to avoid becoming totally immersed in her work.
Outside the studio, she attempts to stay fresh by doing things
unrelated to music.
   ``She's truly an excellent cook,'' Walden said. ``She has a
fighting spirit and she has to balance out her life, and cooking is
that release.''
   There is little time for cooking these days. Instead of food,
projects are simmering on all burners.
   Her new album, ``Through the Storm,'' features duets with Elton
John, James Brown and Whitney Houston. She also plans to write her
memoirs.
   ``The book will contain several juicy tidbits,'' said Franklin,
whose life provides a lot of material.
   Her father was the Rev. C.L. Franklin, a civil rights activist
and religious leader who also was prominent in gospel music
circles. Aretha was born in Memphis, Tenn. Her mother, a gospel
singer, left when she was about six, and Franklin moved his family
first to Buffalo, N.Y., and then to Detroit.
   As a child, Aretha saw such luminaries as the Nobelist Martin
Luther King Jr., Motown Records founder Berry Gordy and pop star
Sam Cooke in the Franklin's inner-city Detroit home.
   Her father was a popular ``electronic'' preacher who toured the
country with appearances and made dozens of albums. Under his
tutelage, a shy and introverted Aretha started singing gospel songs
at an early age. She quit school when she was about 14 to tour with
him, and made the live LP, ``Aretha Gospel,'' at his Detroit
church. She signed her first recording contract with Columbia
Records at 18, a discovery of the great record producer John
Hammond.
   Hammond, who produced such artists as Bob Dylan, Bessie Smith
and Bruce Springsteen, called Franklin ``an untutored genius.'' He
said she was the best voice he'd heard since Billie Holiday, who he
had also produced.
   After some minor success with such songs as Otis Redding's ``Try
a Little Tenderness,'' Franklin moved to Atlantic Records in 1966.
A year later, she exploded on the charts with her interpretation of
his ``Respect.'' Redding, who died a few months later in a plane
crash, said he liked Franklin's version better than his own.
   By 1969, she had forged an impressive chain of hits: ``A Natural
Woman,'' ``Chain of Fools,'' ``Do Right Woman _ Do Right Man,'' ``I
Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You),'' ``Dr. Feelgood,''
``Think.''
   Her trademark two-ocatave jumps, impassioned bursts and gospel
whoops made her something of a legend. She moved with ease from
soul to show tunes to popular standards, but after her two most
ambitious albums, ``Young, Gifted and Black'' and ``Spirit in the
Dark,'' in the early '70s, her career slowed; she was still
popular, but the commercial success wasn't there.
   And her personal life _ three marriages and an especially
difficult divorce _ seemed to affect her musical life. She left
Atlantic and moved to Arista in 1980, where she has once again
found the golden touch.
   Besides the book, Franklin would like to make a movie. She had a
cameo role in the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd movie, ``The Blues
Brothers'' in 1980, singing ``Think.''
   Her fear of flying and addiction to afternoon soap operas keep
her home and off the road. ``From noon until 3:30 in the afternoon,
nothing gets done in my home until the soaps are over,'' she said.
   For the past few years, Franklin has been taking a class to
overcome her phobia, but she still hasn't flown. In December, she
gave a concert in Atlantic City, traveling to the New Jersey resort
by luxury bus.
   ``It was fun,'' the singer said. ``It gave me a chance to see
some of the country.''
   She's scheduled to sing there again May 26-28.
   The singer scoffs at the notion that her career is on the
decline, as some in the business have suggested. ``I would say that
my greatest accomplishment hasn't even happened yet. I'm just a
baby in the industry and I'm still learning.''
   But Franklin is far from a toddler in the music business, having
taken giant steps since her humble beginnings as a gospel singer.
With little formal training, she's achieved great success relying
mostly on raw talent, and taking her cue from such gospel greats as
Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward.
   She's also been able to change with the times. The raw emotion
of her music in the '60s has been refined and slickly packaged _
with synthesizers and special audio effects _ to widen her appeal
in the '80s.
   Early on, such songs as ``Respect'' snared R&amp;B fans, and she
later won a pop audience with her tributes to Judy Garland and
Josephine Baker. In the '80s, she grabbed the rockers with
``Freeway of Love'' and ``Jump to It.''
   ``She's got a core following, so she'll always be popular,''
said Mary Moore, director of rhythm and blues publicity at Arista.
``But the new album should win over even more fans because of the
duets, like the one with Whitney Houston.''
   Popularity is fine, but as far as Franklin is concerned,
``There's no place like home. My family is here and my roots are
here.''
   The interview abruptly ended.
   ``I have to check on the gumbo simmering on the stove,'' said
the Queen of Soul.

<HEAD>75 Years Ago, USDA Extension Service Was Born to Help Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agricultural progress has had many mileposts.
But none is more revered in the United States than the development
of the land-grant institutions of higher learning and the extension
system that carried knowledge to farmers.
   Seventy-five years ago, on May 8, 1914, the Smith-Lever Act was
signed into law by President Wilson, creating an Agriculture
Department agency to work with states, counties and land-grant
schools to get the latest word from classrooms and laboratories
into the farthest reaches of rural America.
   The federal role had already been important for decades. It was
the 1862 Morrill Act, after all, that initially endowed the
land-grant institutions _ the ``silo techs'' and ``cow colleges'' _
by selling off 11 million acres of federal land.
   The Hatch Act of 1887 provided funds for starting experiment
stations at every land-grant school. And, in 1890, a second Morrill
Act established black land-grant colleges in southern states.
   In 1898, USDA hired an Iowan, Seaman A. Knapp, to work in the
South. In Louisiana, Knapp used a farm in each township to
demonstrate the latest rice production methods to local farmers. In
1903, he set up demonstrations to reduce cotton boll weevil damage
in Louisiana and Texas.
   As Knapp's concepts of moving information from schools and
experiment stations caught on, new ``county agents'' were gradually
added, along with home demonstration agents and youth clubs, which
became 4-H.
   With private funds and local tax support augmenting limited USDA
funds, the cooperative extension system grew. By June 1918, during
World War I, 2,435 counties had agricultural agents and 1,715 had
home demonstration agents working with USDA to boost wartime food
production.
   By 1921, however, the number of county units was cut back
sharply as emergency war funds dried up. In the 1930s, extension
agents were selected by USDA to explain and interpret for farmers
the new agricultural agencies and programs created to help them dig
out of the Depression.
   Through the years, says USDA historian Doug Bowers, the
extension system has remained a popular fixture among rural people.
   ``Before extension, there had been lots of books written on
agriculture and there had been agricultural societies, which tended
to be for gentlemen farmers, for the most part,'' Bowers said in a
telephone interview.
   Most farmers in the late 19th century and well into the 20th
weren't reached by scholarly books and papers written by
professors. Farmers were slow to change their methods.
   ``Extension was a way to get down to the level of the farmer and
reach him with the latest research,'' Bowers said. ``It was the
first time that had been done systematically.''
   As the county agents did their jobs, farmers used technology to
produce more food and fiber. They were able to plow and plant more
land. They grew larger _ but fewer. Millions left the land and
moved to the cities as technology and economics gripped rural
America.
   In the early 1900s, there were more than 6 million farms in the
United States. Today, there are barely 2 million.
   ``The problem has certainly shifted,'' Bowers said. ``Back
around the turn of the century, there were a lot of farmers who had
very little idea of the research going on, they weren't terribly
well educated. So it was a matter of educating farmers about fairly
basic things.''
   For example, he said, conservation wasn't much of a concern
until the 1930s, when dust storms and drought drew national
attention to the plight of the nation's soil.
   So the typical county agent of 50 or 75 years ago was concerned
with getting farmers to try new seeds, fertilizer or a different
way of tillage. Perhaps crop rotation was required, or drainage, or
summer fallow. Improved livestock bloodlines, animal nutrition, new
breeds of poultry and other innovations were introduced.
   A recent USDA pamphlet speaks of ``extension professionals in
nearly all of the nation's 3,150 counties.''
   These days, the Extension Service cites a number of ``national
initiatives'' that are supposed to ``provide a new focus'' for
extension's educational efforts. Those range from helping farmers
find ``alternative agricultural opportunities'' to conservation and
management of natural resources, water quality, diet and nutrition,
rural development are others.
   Has extension been so successful that it is no longer needed?
Has it worked itself out of a job?
   ``That's a queston that's much debated,'' says historian Bowers.
``I don't think I could answer that.''
   Myron Johnsrud, Extension Service administrator, says there is
plenty to do. In remarks announcing this week's kickoff of
observances during the 75th anniversary year, Johnsrud said
extension's mission now, as it was in 1914, ``is to deliver
research-based information to people where they live and work.''
   Critical issues facing Americans, including food safety, water
quality and ``youth at risk,'' are at the top of the extension
agenda, he said.
   ``And the tools of technology _ computers, video, satellites,
videodiscs _ are revolutionizing the way modern extension staffs
deliver programs,'' Johnsrud said.

<HEAD>A Guided Detour in the Senate</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate wandered into one of its guided
detours the other day, taken there, as so often before, by Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina.
   After a solo campaign failed to stop a bill to finance the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission, Helms succeeded
in having the statuary rearranged.
   He got the Senate to order a replica of the Declaration of
Independence returned to the Capitol rotunda. It been crowded out
by a bust of King and moved to a hallway between the House and
Senate.
   He also won a provision forbidding the King commission from
promoting campaigns to protest social conditions or ``any form of
civil disobedience.'' The commission can send out material
describing King's use of those tactics, but it can't run
how-to-do-it sessions, as it apparently did at a student conference
last year.
   The focus of the argument was a bill providing $300,000 for each
of the next five years to the commission Congress set up to promote
observance of the King birthday holiday. As Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
put it, the object is to make that holiday ``more than just another
three-day weekend for federal employees.''
   It is another three-day weekend, of course, and not only for
federal workers. All but five states now observe the King holiday,
along with many private businesses.
   Helms, a conservative Republican, opposed the King holiday in
the first place, and he opposed funds for the commission. It was
set up in 1984 to encourage and assist activities appropriate to
the memory of the slain civil rights pioneer.
   The commission originally was supposed to get along without
appropriated funds, but supporters of the bill said private
contributions aren't sufficient any more.
   The bill passed the Senate, 90 to 7, on Tuesday. A final version
now will be negotiated with the House, which had voted to make the
commission permanent and give it $500,000 a year.
   ``I think the holiday should be so well instilled in people's
minds in five years that we will not need a permanent federal
commission to promote it,'' said Nunn, chief sponsor of the Senate
version.
   He'll be up for re-election in Georgia next year. Helms' term is
expiring, too.
   A King bill and a debate that verged on civil rights _ even
though that wasn't the issue _ had political potential on each
side. That certainly wasn't lost on other senators, who delivered a
series of set-piece speeches supporting the bill and praising King
and his cause. Coretta Scott King listened from the Senate gallery.
   While Helms said he didn't want a debate about King, he seemed
bent on starting one. ``Those who believe him to have been a saint
are entitled to their beliefs,'' said Helms. ``I am obliged to say,
however, that this senator fails to understand why, if Dr. King had
such an unblemished career, the records on his career have been
sealed by court order until after the turn of the century.''
   The debate had its moments.
   One came when Helms proposed an amendment urging that every
member of Congress who votes for the commission appropriation
donate $1,000 in personal funds to help finance it. That's a
gimmick he has tried before. ``I think I got seven votes,'' he
recalled. ``I got a lot of hard words.'' This time he withdrew it
without a vote.
   The bill also illustrates the persistence of federal agencies,
no matter their size or mission.
   The King commission originally was to have a brief run,
encouraging special events on the first of the holidays. After
that, presumably, people would know how to observe the holiday
without advice. While it was to have been done without federal
funds, the commission got the right to use staffers from other
government agencies. So far, that and offices have cost about $2.3
million.
   Helms said he was worried about precedent _ no other individual
has a special commission to deal with his holiday. He wondered
where it would end.
   Nunn countered that there are, too, such commissions, among them
the one preparing for the 500th anniversary in 1992 of the voyage
of Christopher Columbus. Granted, said Helms, but that happens only
twice a millennium, and he voted against it anyhow.
   ``I do not think we ought to spend the taxpayers money with a
lot of folderol even though Christopher Columbus did a pretty good
thing when he discovered America,'' Helms said.
   Then there was the matter of Officer McGruff, a cartoon
bloodhound who offers crime-fighting tips in a promotion that gets
more than $2 million a year in federal funds. Nunn said he thinks
that well-spent and believes the smaller appropriation to spread
the King message will be, too.
   After Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, joined the parade in
praising King, he offered a capsule review of the two-day debate:
   ``What must the American people think of us to be arguing at
length over this relatively minor expenditure to honor a great
American?''

   A federal bankruptcy judge gave interested
buyers a week to submit offers for Eastern Airlines, as a new
potential bidder emerged and another carrier made a proposal to buy
Eastern's profitable Northeast shuttle.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland set a May 10 deadline
for bidders to make offers for Eastern in its entirety, or for the
shuttle at a price exceeding the $365 million that developer Donald
Trump has agreed to pay for the business.
   Separately Wednesday, America West Airlines Inc. said it had
offered to pay $726 million for the shuttle and 10 Boeing 757

   The economy ``grew at a moderate, sustainable
pace'' in the past three months, the Federal Reserve said in a
report which analysts took as a sign that the central bank will not
boost interest rates.
   The Fed's review of economic conditions around the country,
released Wednesday, painted a picture of an economy in which the
growth rate is slowing with inflationary pressures easing.
   The central bank for the past year has been trying to engineer
such a development by pushing interest rates up to dampen demand
and thus relieve pressures on tight labor markets and factories
operating at capacity.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Deadline For Eastern Bids; Another Potential Bidder Emerges</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interested buyers have just one week to submit
offers for strike-torn Eastern Airlines following a ruling by a
federal bankruptcy judge.
   A new potential bidder emerged Wednesday and another airline
made a proposal to buy Eastern's lucrative Northeast shuttle
service.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland set a May 10 deadline
for bidders to make offers for Eastern in its entirety, or for the
shuttle at a price exceeding the $365 million that developer Donald
Trump has agreed to pay for the business.
   Separately, America West Airlines Inc. said it offered to pay
$726 million for the shuttle routes and landing slots, along with
10 Boeing 757 airliners, raising the possibility of a bidding
contest for that business.
   Eastern, which has been largely grounded since a March 4 walkout
by its Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions, has
rejected several buyout proposals for the entire airline. The
company plans to reorganize as a smaller carrier and to raise about
$1.8 billion by selling aircraft and other assets.
   Lifland has been pushing to get the airline back to full
operations as soon as possible. At the same time, he supports a
sale of the entire company.
   David Shapiro, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner who
recommended the one-week deadline for proposals, also asked for a
May 17 hearing to evaluate any offers that had been made by then.
   All sales of Eastern assets must be approved by the federal
bankruptcy court, which is overseeing the airline's Chapter 11
reorganization.
   Shapiro also submitted a sealed report to the court on his
investigation of past Eastern financial transactions and other
matters.
   In a brief summary, he concluded there were ``substantial
conflicts of interest'' in the bankruptcy case because Eastern and
Continental Airlines are run as separate subsidiaries by the same
management, that of their parent, Texas Air Corp. But in fact the
airlines are rivals, he said.
   During Wednesday's hearing, an attorney disclosed that a group
led by William Howard, the former chairman of Piedmont Airlines,
and the investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. was
interested in making a buyout proposal.
   Attorney Lewis Kaden said the Howard group had been in
discussions with Eastern, its creditors and unions and was willing
to formulate an offer by this weekend. Kaden declined to give
specifics of the offer but said it would include a bankruptcy
reorganization plan. He said the offer includes Eastern's shuttle
service.
   Kaden said the Howard group had been given confidential
financial information already provided to billionaire hotel
executive Jay Pritzker, who also has submitted an offer.
   Shapiro said he was told by Eastern the financial information
also has been given to takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, the owner
and chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., who previously expressed
interest in Eastern. But TWA General Counsel Mark Buckstein told
The Associated Press late Wednesday, ``I absolutely and
unequivocally deny receiving any documents from (Eastern).''
   Buckstein said TWA requested the documents last Thursday.
   Eastern and Texas Air have turned down a buyout offer from a
group led by former Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth plus
proposals by Pritzker and others that they said were not ``bona
fide'' offers.
   Shapiro seemed to agree, saying he was seeking a ``serious,
fleshed-out real life offer, and not some of the things I have been
seeing over the past weeks.''
   In a statement from its Phoenix headquarters, America West
indicated it would pay $390 million cash for the Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle, with the balance of its offer to be paid
in cash and by assumption of obligations related to the 10 757
jetliners.
   Eastern has agreed to sell the shuttle along with 17 smaller,
older Boeing 727s to Trump, but the deal has not been approved by
the bankruptcy court.
   Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle _ the name the
developer plans to use for the service _ said of the America West
proposal: ``We have no comment. We don't know anything about it.''
   But, he said, ``We have a signed contract with Eastern.''
   America West has indicated its interest in buying Eastern's
shuttle or other assets several times since the strike began.

<HEAD>Economy Holds Together Despite Damage From U.S. Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's economy is holding together
more than a year after the United States imposed sanctions on the
Panamanian government, but increasingly it is a hand-to-mouth,
day-to-day brand of surival.
   The sanctions imposed in March and April of last year were
intended to force the departure of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
de facto ruler of Panama who has been indicted in the United States
on drug trafficking charges.
   Noriega, chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces, remains very
much in charge as Sunday's presidential election approaches. The
United States and opposition figures accuse the government of
planning to cheat to give Noriega's candidate victory.
   The sanctions froze about $56 million in Panamanian government
deposits in American banks and banned payments of taxes and some
other fees to entities of the Panamanian government.
   The United States also is holding about $140 million in withheld
Panama Canal payments in the name of Eric Delvalle, deposed by
Noriega in March 1988 and still recognized by the United States as
the president of Panama.
   Bank deposits here are down sharply, huge sums have left the
country, savings accounts remain frozen and a shortage of cash has
cut sharply into loan availability, which means new development and
construction are way down.
   Ironically, the survival of the economy is due in considerable
part to what the United States and U.S. businesses spend here _
about $500 million a year, not counting the military payroll for
10,000 Southern Command troops and payrolls and expenditures of
several large American companies.
   The businesses include a Texaco refinery, the trans-Panama oil
pipeline and the Cherokee Land Co., a banana-growing concern that
continues to export bananas but because of the sanctions does not
pay the government export taxes of about $1 million a month.
   The $500 million, most of it related to the Panama Canal, is
about 12 percent of Panama's gross domestic product. A large share
of that could be lost to Panama if the United States further
tightens the sanctions.
   The government is blaming nearly all of its problems on the
sanctions, although the economic decline actually started in
mid-1987, when Panamanians worried about political instability
started sending money out of the country.
   By Panamanian government figures, the gross domestic product
dropped about 17.1 percent in 1988, from $5 billion to about $4.1
billion; American economists contend only about a fourth of the
drop is due to the sanctions.
   Between June of 1987 and December of 1988 internal bank deposits
were down from $4.4 billion to $2.8 billion, indicating capital
flight of about $1.6 billion.
   Time deposits have been frozen and speculators have done a brisk
business buying them up for cash at a discount in hopes they
eventually will be released.
   Panama, which uses the American dollar, has no central bank and
cannot print more money unless it establishes its own currency,
which then would be subject to heavy inflationary pressures.
   In a statement published Wednesday, the government's National
Banking Commission said the situation had hit bottom and was
starting to improve slightly, especially with foreign deposits in
Panamanian banks.
   But the commission said the banking system has a long way to go
before returning to where it was before the crisis.
   ``It still is necessary to increase the availability of loan
funds in banks. And this can be achieved if we Panamanians keep our
funds in banks in Panama,'' it said.
   It predicted that the opposition will refuse to accept defeat in
Sunday's presidential election and resort to violence and, for that
reason, the commission could not assure that savings accounts would
be freed in June as had been predicted.
   Unemployment in Panama is put at about 20 percent, but that
figure does not take into account the partial employment and
under-employment brought about by sanction-related stagnation.
   Normally in Latin America repatriation of capital flight follows
a period of political stability, something Panama may not see for a
time. Panama has suspended payment of its considerable domestic and
foreign debt, which once took about 40 percent of the national
budget.
   A Panamanian government assessment of damages from the
sanctions, published in February, said $77.8 million in loan
agreements and donations for development projects had been
cancelled by the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   The government's income was down 44 percent, the study said. The
number of Panamanians below the poverty line, it said, has risen
from about 33 percent to 40 percent.

   The AFL-CIO urged a bankruptcy judge to order
strike-crippled Eastern Airlines sold, condemning its current
owners for treating the carrier as ``a fiscal carcass to be picked
over for the benefit of other corporate entities.''
   The 14 million-member labor federation's governing body also
promised Wednesday continued support for Eastern's striking
Machinists union and the flight attendants and pilots who have
honored pickets, saying their solidarity in the two-month strike
has ``won the admiration of the entire labor movement.''
   The statement was issued by the AFL-CIO executive council as the
bankruptcy court in New York held a hearing on whether Eastern
should be sold in its entirety. The judge set a one-week deadline
for potential buyers to make proposals.
   Eastern's owner, Texas Air Corp., has insisted none of several
offers for the airline is workable and proposed a plan to shrink
Eastern that it says would allow the airline to emerge from
bankruptcy. The plan includes selling about $1.8 billion in Eastern
assets.
   The AFL-CIO said Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo has engaged in
``systematic milking of Eastern's assets to feed other sectors of
his Texas Air Corp.'' and said his mismanagement ``has literally
run the airline into the ground.''
   Leaders of Eastern's unions briefed the executive council before
the statement was issued, and pledged to work with new management
should the airline be sold.
   The AFL-CIO has raised more than $1.2 million in strike aid for
the Eastern unions and promised to continue fund-raising and other
support efforts until the strike is concluded.

   Maria Troy, penniless and far from home, found
both a motel room and a job through a national motel chain's
program to help the homeless.
   ``Roughly about 35 percent of the hotel rooms in the United
States go empty every night on an average,'' said Mike Leven,
president and chief operating officer of Atlanta-based Days Inn of
America. ``And certainly other businesses could do the same kind of
housing, training and rehabilitation that we've done.''
   Ms. Troy and her 9-year-old son, John, were among the first 10
to 15 people helped by the program. They had spent two months in a
shelter for the homeless before Ms. Troy was given a job taking
reservations at Days Inn of America headquarters. She and her son
moved into a motel owned by a Days Inn franchisee.
   The two had been in the United States about two years since
leaving Mexico and did not have enough money to rejoin Ms. Troy's
family there.
   They finally went home last month. In an interview before their
departure, Ms. Troy said Days Inn made her ``feel like I'm not just
an employee or a computer _ I'm a human being.''
   So far, the program has been limited to the Atlanta area, where
an estimated 10,000 people are homeless.
   Participants often work in reservations, where they make $4.50
to $5.50 an hour plus incentives. They are provided rooms at half
the normal rate of $20 a day, with Days Inn making up the
difference to the franchisee.
   ``We do it through a payroll deduction,'' Leven said. ``They're
able to get a decent place to stay. They pay 50 percent of it from
their wages, and we pay the other 50 percent, and then they're
rehabilitated into the work force and trained and put into work.
Some of them have already been promoted and left our jobs for
better jobs.''
   Ms. Troy had been promoted from reservations to a position
involving tours and special packages before she left.
   ``Happily, Maria reached a point where she could make a choice
and ... do what she felt was best for her,'' said Carol Bivins, the
motel chain's vice president of public relations.
   In Washington, Michele Kelley of the American Hotel and Motel
Association said she knew of no other such programs in the lodging
industry.
   ``I think we're going to see it more and more from the public in
general, that they're going to do more for the homeless because
it's such an issue,'' Ms. Kelley said.
   Leven started the program in February 1988 after being asked to
visit a homeless shelter with the idea of possibly making a
donation.
   ``Mike Leven spent one evening at the shelter and turned around
and said, `Why don't we do something that will really make a
difference? Why don't we do something that really will employ some
of the homeless?''' Ms. Bivins said.
   A Days Inn job meant the end of life in a shelter for Delores
Smith, 31, and her three children, ranging from 16 months to 12
years old.
   Ms. Smith, who spent about three months in a homeless shelter
last year before she joined the Days Inn program, came to Atlanta
from Colorado looking for work.
   ``I had been seeking work for a long time,'' she recalled.
``Every day I would go out, and I would fill out applications and
nobody ever responded.''
   A cashier's job she had briefly didn't work out. And in April
1988, she entered the shelter.
   ``That was the end of my hope,'' she said.
   She recalled that a woman at the shelter ``just looked at me and
said, `I don't think you want to be in here. Would you like a job?'
She asked if I could type. I said yes. She got me in contact with
Days Inn.''
   She chose to stay at the shelter briefly and then found an
apartment, working but never living in a Days Inn.
   ``I have a lot of confidence in myself now,'' Ms. Smith said.
   ``I think there's a lot of people out there who just need a
chance,'' Ms. Smith said. ``That's what they gave me; they gave me
a chance. ... I've been working. I feel like I'll be somebody.''

<HEAD>Avon Snubs Takeover Feelers From Amway And Jacobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc. has rebuffed
takeover feelers from Amway Corp. and investor Irwin L. Jacobs and
says it isn't entertaining any offers.
   Minneapolis-based Jacobs and rival direct selling company Amway
told the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday that they
hold about 5.57 million of Avon's 53.88 million shares outstanding,
or about 10.3 percent. They also purchased options to buy 40,000
shares on April 5 for $1.25 to $2 a piece.
   Most of the shares were bought from April 3 to May 2 for prices
ranging from $23 to $32.28{ each, the partners disclosed in a
document submitted to the SEC.
   The A-J Partnership formed by the two said Avon stock seems
undervalued and they might buy more shares from time to time. The
partners may make a merger proposal to Avon but no decision has
been reached, they said in the SEC filing. In response, Avon
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James Preston issued a
statement declaring, ``We want to make it clear that Avon is not
for sale.''
   Avon stock gained $4.75 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading Wednesday, closing at $36.87{ in heavy volume. The price
surpassed its previous 52-week high of $32.50.
   At that price, if the partners were to buy all Avon common stock
and equivalents they don't own, the cost would total about $2.4
billion.
   Avon is widely known as a door-to-door distributor of
toiletries, fragrances and household products made famous by its
``Avon lady'' ad campaigns of years past. But much of Avon's
revenue now comes from workplace and telephone orders; Avon has
been moving toward more direct marketing via mailings.
   The New York-based company has been realigning its operations to
focus on its beauty businesses. After a largely unsuccessful foray
into the health care services industry, Avon sold or is in the
process of selling its nursing homes, retirement living facilities
and alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers.
   Preston stated that Avon has been improving its profitability
and stockholders would be better off if Avon pursues its current
objectives. Avon had sales of $3.06 billion in 1988 and lost $404.5
million, mainly due to the cost of getting out of the health care
services industry.
   ``We believe that Avon can provide the best value to its
shareholders by remaining independent,'' Preston said. ``Our
strategies have resulted in the strong sales and profit growth of
our beauty business for the last three years.''
   Avon has been the subject of takeover talk for some time, most
recently last week after Unilever's planned acquisition of the
Faberge and Elizabeth Arden toiletries, cosmetics and fragrance
lines fell through.
   There has been speculation that Unilever, a huge European
personal products conglomerate, would turn its attention on other
cosmetics concerns and Avon has been mentioned by Wall Street
analysts as a possibility.
   Avon owns several properties that Unilever, which has said it
would like to increase its interests in expensive, or prestige,
items, might find appealing. Among Avon's prestige products are the
fragrances Red and Giorgio and actress Cher's Uninhibited scent.
   The financial markets have bid up Avon stock on the hunch that a
suitor might come calling.
   Amway, based in Ada, Mich., was founded about 30 years ago and
is closely held by Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos. It has become
the second-largest direct sales firm after Avon and says it has
more than 1 million distributors vs. Avon's 1.475 million
independent sales representatives worldwide.
   Telephone calls to Amway seeking comment on its intentions were
not returned.
   Calls to Jacobs also went unreturned. He has had experience with
the direct sales business as the owner of Watkins Products Co., a
personal products company, which uses the door-to-door technique.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp. and the United
Steelworkers reached a tentative contract settlement that would
restore wages and benefits that union members gave up during the
last six years, according to a published report.
   An agreement would make Bethlehem the first to settle of four
major steelmakers negotiating early replacements for contracts that
expire July 31. The contracts cover 43,600 USW members.
   The Allentown Morning Call reported Wednesday that the union's
21-member negotiating committee will vote Friday on terms the USW
negotiators presented Tuesday in Pittsburgh.
   ``The framework of an agreement is coming together,'' said union
spokesman Gary Hubbard.
   He confirmed the internal union briefing Tuesday night and the
vote Friday, but he declined to comment on the Morning Call's
report that wages would rise by several dollars over the term of
the contract.
   The pact would run longer than the three-year term of each of
the two previous agreements, the Morning Call said.
   Each of the 20,500 USW members at Bethlehem also would get
$1,000 signing bonuses, and the contract would restore three paid
holidays plus premium pay for work on Sunday, the newspaper said.
   Another union official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the tentative agreement meets the union's goals of restoring
concessions made in the last six years to help Bethlehem withstand
an industry slump. He, too, declined comment on the terms published
by the Morning Call.
   If approved Friday by the negotiating committee, the Bethlehem
agreement would go to the union international executive board and

<HEAD>Last Year's Total Already Equaled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVENDALE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales by General Electric Co.'s aircraft
engine division this year already match the total for all of 1988.
   This week, the division, whose offices are in this Cincinnati
suburb, announced three new orders totaling $355 million. This
means that more than $5 billion in new commercial jet engine orders
have been awarded this year to GE and CFM International, its 50-50
partner with SNECMA of France.
   ``1989 promises to be an absolutely phenomenal year for our
commercial engine business. The agreements we have reached with our
customers have been unprecedented,'' said Brian Rowe, senior vice
president for the division.
   Through the first four months of 1989, CFM obtained commercial
engine orders valued at $3.1 billion. Meanwhile, GE was awarded $2
billion worth of new orders for its CF6-80C2 engine.
   GE said Wednesday that it will supply CF6-80C2 engines valued at
as much as $230 million for at least eight and as many as 12 Airbus
Industrie A310-300 widebody aircraft ordered by Trans European
Airways in Belgium.
   GE also announced that Air Algerie has specified CF6-80C2
engines valued at more than $40 million for three Boeing 767-300
widebodies it ordered.
   Thai Airways chose the CF6 engine to power one Boeing 747-400
widebody it ordered this week. That order is worth $20 million.
   In addition, Thai Airways specified CFM56-3 engines valued at
$65 million for seven Boeing 737-400 narrow body jetliners.
   CFM engines are jointly produced in the United States and
France. The CF6 engine is made by GE alone at Evendale.

<HEAD>Incentives Working Some as Sales Rise During April</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales, Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers' incentives appear to be working some
magic, as sales during April bounced back from levels a month
before and a year earlier, but the pace may taper off in May.
   Last month's vehicle sales ran 7.6 percent ahead of last April's
pace, the eight major automakers with U.S. plants reported
Wednesday.
   But during April 21-30, the carmakers said their car and light
truck sales were down 0.7 percent, falling to an average daily rate
of 46,394, compared with a rate of 46,736 during the same time last
year.
   The industry was focused on April sales after the nation's Big
Three automakers introduced new incentive packages at the beginning
of the month that were designed to inject some adrenalin into the
sluggish sales recorded in March.
   ```March sales created fears that the market was drying up and
April sales figures reversed that,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York.
   ``The results of the incentives have been gratifying for us,''
said Robert Rewey, vice president for North American sales for Ford
Motor Co.
   In April, Ford cornered 30.3 percent of the U.S.-made car
market, compared with 45.9 percent for General Motors Corp. and
13.3 percent for Chrysler Corp. In April 1988, Ford held 28.6
percent of the same market, GM had 48.3 percent and Chrysler
accounted for 14.6 percent.
   Typically, automakers let their inventories build during the
first two months of the year in anticipation of active sales during
March and April, as Americans prepare to take to the road during
summer vacations and weekend trips.
   Automakers with U.S. plants reported a sales rate of 37,708
vehicles during March of this year, 10.3 percent behind the rate
for April, giving an indication that the incentives were working.
   ``I think the incentives have spurred people in here,'' said
Jack Adler, sales manager of Galles Chevrolet-Geo in Albuquerque,
N.M.
   ``April sales reduced inventory,'' Merlis said. ``They showed
that incentives at least worked a little and there is no sign of a
downward spiral.''
   Automakers became concerned about their inventories in March
when softer-than-expected sales coupled with ambitious production
schedules expanded inventories.
   To counter that and to entice buyers, GM, Ford and Chrysler a
month ago introduced such new incentive programs as low financing
and cash rebate offers. The Ford program expires May 31, GM's runs
out June 5 and Chrysler's are in effect indefinitely.
   Despite the year-to-year sales increase in April, the rate was
disappointing to Tom Webb, a senior economist for the National
Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
   ``I think it implies that the underlying demand is much weaker
than most people expected,'' he said. ``I think they're either
going to have to do something to spur sales or (enact) further
production cuts.''
   There has been speculation that the manufacturers will take
longer than usual in the late summer and early autumn to prepare
factories for the 1990 models, some of which already are in
showrooms. Such a move could further reduce 1989 inventories.
   But Merlis said Wednesday's figures might defuse that
speculation.
   ``April sales obviate the need for wholesale production cuts,''
he said. ``Although I think we'll have a normal cyclical cooldown
this year, April suggests that sales are not falling off a cliff.''

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for the third period of April 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year.
   For the month, there were 25 selling days this year and 26
selling days last year. There have been 101 selling days this year
and were 103 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar held steady in European trading late
this morning, with volume sharply cut by the Ascension day holiday
in much of Europe.
   Gold prices moved down.
   Only British, Italian and a few Swiss banks were actively
trading in the foreign exchange market.
   ``The market is in effect very lazy. There have been a few small
corporate orders, but that's about it,'' one Italian trader said.
   The dollar was supported by bullish sentiment but was capped by
fear of heavy central bank intervention, dealers said. The central
banks showed their presence repeatedly over the past few days when
the dollar made attempts to move higher, they said.
   The Japanese market was closed for a holiday.
   In London, the dollar was quoted at 133.85 yen, compared with
133.93 yen late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8880 West German marks, down from
1.8900; 1.6810 Swiss francs, down from 1.6830; 6.3725 French
francs, unchanged; 2.1290 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1270; 1,380.00
Italian lire, up from 1,379.20; 1.1838 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1830.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6845, compared with
$1.6847 Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $377.90 a troy ounce,
down from $377.95 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$378.20.
   The Zurich gold market was closed.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.61 to close at a bid $379.16.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.65 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Chicago-Style Hot Dogs Headed For Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As slogans go, ``The heartful food with a harmony
taste'' lacks the gusto of ``Drag it through the garden,'' but a
Japanese company is hoping it will strike the right chord with
Tokyo office workers hungry for a taste of Chicago.
   The product is the Chicago-style hot dog: an all-beef weiner
with tomatoes, onions, mustard, relish, cucumbers, jalapeno peppers
and celery salt in a poppy-seed bun.
   Chicago Foods Corp., a Tokyo-based company formed by the Japan
Tobacco Co., the Kitoku Rice Co. and Yonekyu, meat-processing
company, plans to open the first Chicago Hot Dogs stand in Tokyo in
July with managers trained in a Chicago-area hot-dog restaurant.
   Richard Portillo, the local entrepreneur who struck the deal
with Chicago Foods, said he hopes Chicago-style hot dogs will be as
big a hit in Japan as McDonald's hamburgers, which are available at
more than 650 locations
   ``Nobody's taken a concept like the hot dog and tried to do
something like this in Japan,'' Portillo said Wednesday in a
telephone interview from his car, which has license plates reading
TOPDOG1.
   Actually, the Japanese can already buy something called a hot
dog but it's a far cry from the hefty handful available in Chicago.
The Asian fast-food chain Lotteria sells a version consisting of
spiced meat chunks in a casing, and sausages coated with batter and
deep-fried are popular festival fare.
   But the Chicago-style dog is another breed altogether, said Paul
Chang, a Chinese-born, American-educated Chicago Foods employee who
is learning the hot dog business from Portillo.
   ``We call it a harmony taste,'' he said. ``From end to end of
bun, you can have the same flavor at any bite.''
   Chang said Chicago Foods' advertising will also reflect their
product's heritage.
   ``In the Midwest, you call this place the heartland, right? So
we call this food heartful food. Heartful food with a harmony
taste.''
   Portillo, whose 11 namesake restaurants dot Chicago's western
suburbs, reached an agreement in August to teach the Japanese
company the secrets of his success.
   He said Chicago Foods selected his company as a model after
scouring the country for a chain offering a uniquely American food.
   The Japanese company sent Chang and three other prospective
restaurant managers to the Chicago area this spring for eight weeks
of training at Portillo's restaurant in Naperville. They will
return to Japan later this month.
   If all goes well with its first two outlets in Tokyo, Chicago
Foods plans to open 70 restaurants within three years, said
Portillo, who will receive a percentage of the company's sales for
20 years.
   Portillo said he also received a ``large fee'' up front, but he
would not disclose the amount. He said his Chicago restaurants had
sales of more than $20 million last year.
   Chang said he eats hot dogs every day, usually with the works,
while the training group's leader, Takashi Kogahara, prefers only
onions, tomatoes and cucumbers.
   In Japan, he said, Chicago Foods may add grilled onions and
shredded lettuce to the list of condiments.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Helping people figure out how much to
pay Uncle Sam paid off for H&amp;R Block Inc. this year.
   The company prepared 13,090,000 tax returns worldwide, according
to preliminary figures released Wednesday by the Kansas City-based
firm.
   That was an increase of 526,000, or 4.2 percent, from 1988. The
returns accounted for $630.9 million in taxes.
   The figures bucked a trend in the tax-preparation business, the
company said. Usually, fewer people use tax preparers in the second
year after tax-overhaul legislation is enacted, said Donald Ayers,
Block's vice president for finance.
   After the Tax Reform Act of 1986 went into effect, Block had a
record increase in the number of tax returns it prepared, Ayers
said. But the company had expected trouble this year.
   ``In the first year after tax reform we always have a boost in
business because people are confused,'' Ayers said. ``But in the
second year, the numbers decrease because many people go back to
self-preparation.''
   Block and its franchises operate more than 8,700 tax-preparation
offices worldwide.

   Share prices were sharply higher at midday
Thursday, with prices of selected issues marked up as a bit of
institutional buying interest caught market makers short of stock.
   At about 12:15 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 17.4 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,123.1, its
best level of the day. At its lowest, the index was up 10.6 points

   Volume came to 321.9 million shares by midday, compared with
234.7 million shares at the same time Wednesday.
   Dealers generally were surprised by the market's performance,
which had been expected to continue its recent dull tone, at least
until Friday's report on U.S. employment for April.
   ``Personally I find it very difficult to see why the market
should have a bull run at the moment,'' said an equities salesman
for a leading British brokerage firm.
   ``It's a combination of just a little bit of buying interest and
a market where there isn't very much stock around,'' added another

<HEAD>State Officials Hope to Block Airline Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Carr and Wayne County officials
oppose a debt financed buyout of Northwest Airlines' parent
company, fearing it could ground expansion plans at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport.
   ``We're fighting for our lives,'' Wayne County Executive Ed
McNamara said Wednesday.
   Northwest and takeover specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
declined to comment Wednesday on a Wall Street Journal report that
KKR, with access to $413 million in Michigan pension funds, might
bid for the airline.
   Marvin Davis, who bid $2.7 million for the parent company, NWA
Inc., in March, has agreed to a truce in his proxy fight for
control of NWA.
   Michigan has committed $413 million to KKR from five state
employee pension funds since 1982. KKR has drawn $171 million and
the state has realized a 40 percent return on the investment, a
state Department of Treasury spokesman said.
   KKR has agreed to study any Michigan-based company trying to
resist a takeover, but has said it would emerge as a ``white
knight'' only if that would be profitable.
   KKR would have to formally request any state funds wanted for a
Northwest takeover, the Treasury Department spokesman said.
   Northwest is the largest airline at Metro Airport and would pay
the biggest share of costs of a planned expansion.
   McNamara said Wayne County lawyers will file a lawsuit Friday
aimed at blocking the sale of NWA Inc. to anyone who would finance
the acquisition with huge amounts of debt.
   A county contract with the airline bars a takeover or merger
that reduces NWA's net worth, he said.
   Carr said in Washington he would introduce a bill next week to
require the U.S. Department of Transportation to examine airline
buyouts more closely.
   The bill would prohibit the sales if high debts from the buyout
threatened to compromise safety or the carrier's ability to
operate, said Carr, a member of the House Appropriations
Committee's transportation subcommittee.

   The stock market headed lower today, continuing
its week-long pullback as traders awaited the employment report for
April.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 25.10 points from
Monday through Wednesday, slipped another 4.04 to 2,389.66 in the
first half hour today.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 373 up, 532 down and
528 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.87 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Wall Street attention has focused all week on Friday's scheduled
report from the Labor Department on the employment situation for
April.
   Analysts expect the data to serve as evidence of whether the
economy continued to slow last month after giving evidence of
losing some momentum in the first quarter.
   Hopes have been increasing on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve is succeeding in its campaign to cool down inflation
without tightening credit so much as to cause a recession.
   But that belief was challenged at the start of this week when a
trade association of corporate purchasing managers reported that
business activity picked up in April.
   Advance estimates call for the employment report to show an
increase of 225,000 to 250,000 in nonfarm payrolls.
   Losers among the blue chips included DuPont, down ] at 108};
International Paper, down \ at 49\; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
down [ at 34{, and Coca-Cola, down [ at 54}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.16 to 172.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .25 at 345.08.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 9.16 to
2,393.70, bringing its loss over the week's first three sessions to
25.10 points.
   Advancing and declining issues were evenly balanced on the NYSE,
with 680 up, 690 down and 544 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 171.69 million shares, against 172.56
million in the previous session.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade with little news to
stimulate the market.
   Analysts say gains in corn and soybeans may be limited by the
National Weather Service's 6-to-10-day outlook that calls for light
rain over the next two days in western grain states.
   Overnight rain in Kansas and unconfirmed rumors of Chinese
interest in U.S. wheat may have a dampening effect on wheat futures.
   Trading in the market may be on the quiet side, with most of
Europe and Japan on holiday.
   ``The market is treading water in the early going,'' said Frank
Kuba, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 3{ cents higher with
contracts for delivery in May at $4.41 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to } cent higher with May at $2.75} a bushel; oats were 1{
cents to 3 cents higher with May at $1.89 a bushel; soybeans were
2{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with May at $7.48 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .15 cent higher with June at
72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .30 cent

.05 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at 31.05 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled higher Wednesday, while pork futures

<HEAD>Retailers' Report Varied April Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's biggest store chains today posted varied April
sales tallies and analysts said more spring-like weather in the
latter half of the month spurred seasonal purchases, partly
compensating for earlier weakness.
   Softness in sales at several big general retailers reflected
slower economic activity due to costlier debt burdens and inflation
worries, analysts said.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said sales
on an industry-wide basis this year have barely outpaced the
inflation rate, indicating that consumer spending, a key element in
economic growth, is easing. Feiner has scaled down his forecast for
average 1989 retail sales growth to 5.5 percent from 6 percent,
based on sales results so far this year.
   Nonetheless, analysts found some signs in the April figures
indicating that shopping momentum is picking up, particularly for
women's clothing and seasonal goods.
   Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.
in Los Angeles, said retail business was only so-so in the first
two weeks of April.
   But it became better once temperatures turned warm enough to
remind people they needed new spring and summer clothing,
do-it-yourself gadgetry, patio furniture and other outdoor gear.
   ``The arrival of spring weather was the main theme,'' said
Tashjian.
   Furthermore, most big retailers waited out the sluggish period
rather than engaging in widespread price cutting to attract
customers, easing the impact on their profit margins, Tashjian said.
   Today's results were from some of the biggest general
merchandise chains in the United States, plus apparel retailers.
Monthly retail sales figures from the government are more
comprehensive and include the take at other types of establishments
such as auto dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants.
   Sears Roebuck and Co., the nation's biggest retailer, said its
low-price policy introduced earlier this year continued attracting
shoppers.
   Chicago-based Sears said its sales rose 9.2 percent to $2.5
billion in the 4 weeks ended April 29 from $2.29 billion. Sales at
stores open at least a year, called same or comparable store sales,
rose 6.8 percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts consider same-store sales a more
accurate indication of a company's performance than totals that
include sales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports
same-store sales.
   Sears sales through the first quarter of its financial year came
to $7.62 billion, up 11.2 percent from the 1988 first quarter
figure of $6.85 billion.
   K mart Corp., the second-largest general retailer, based in
Troy, Mich., said sales gains in the second half of April at its
outdoor garden shop, home improvement and ladies' apparel
departments only partially offset weakness in the first two weeks
of the month.
   K mart's sales in the four weeks ended April 26 totaled $2.05
billion, up 2.3 percent from April 1988's $2.01 billion. On a
same-store basis though, K mart's sales fell 1 percent.
   Sales at K mart through the first quarter came to $6.07 billion,
up 3.9 percent from $5.84 billion.
   Here are some of the other results:
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discounter based in Bentonville, Ark.,
said its sales rose 25 percent in April to $1.98 billion from $1.58
billion. Its same-store sales were up 11 percent for the month.
   Sales at Wal-Marts through the first quarter were $5.37 billion,
up 25 percent over $4.28 billion in 1988's first quarter.
   Dallas-based J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its sales amounted to
$1.06 billion in the four weeks ended April 29, up 9.3 percent from
$966 million a year earlier. On a comparable store basis, April
sales were up 6.7 percent.
   For the first quarter, Penney's sales came to $3.1 billion, a
4.7 percent increase from $2.97 billion in 1988.
   F.W. Woolworth Co., based in New York, said its domestic sales
increased 11.1 in April 29 to $348 million from $313 million.
Same-store sales gained 6.7 percent.
   For Woolworth's year to date, domestic sales totaled $1.12
billion, up 7.7 percent from $1.04 billion.
   Limited Inc.'s 4-week sales were $307 million, up 22 percent
from $251.1 million in the 1988 period. Comparable store sales rose
18 percent.
   For the first quarter of 1989, Limited's sales rose to $946.6
million, up 19 percent from $811.1 million. The specialty apparel
retailer is based in Columbus, Ohio.
   Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., based in Los Angeles, reported
April sales of $190.3 million, up 3.1 percent from $184.5 million
in the corresponding 1988 period. Same-store sales rose 2.2 percent
in April.
   For the first quarter, sales were $595.3 million, up 9 percent
from $546.1 million.

<HEAD>Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. Plans to Withhold Exxon Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public agency that manages Alaska's
$10 billion oil-wealth savings account will send a message to Exxon
Corp. at its annual meeting by withholding 650,600 shares of Exxon
stock from voting.
   The Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. sent a letter to Exxon Chairman
Lawrence Rawl this week, informing him of the largely symbolic
action to underscore Alaska's concern over the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Prince William Sound.
   ``This incident has brought incredible devastation to regions of
this state and will have long-lasting consequences,'' wrote Oral E.
Freeman, chairman of the Permanent Fund board.
   Freeman urged Rawl ``to take all necessary and appropriate
action to insure that the oil spill is dealt with fully and in a
timely matter.''
   The Permanent Fund is a state trust created in 1976 to ensure
that Alaska residents benefit from the state's oil wealth long
after the oil is gone.
   The fund's investment in Exxon is the second largest of its
stock portfolio and is worth more than $28.1 million. However, it
represents only a small percentage of the total shares of Exxon's
outstanding stock.
   Withholding the shares at Exxon's annual meeting May 18 in
Parsippany, N.J., will mean the votes they represent cannot be used
to establish a quorum or for any vote of the stockholders.
   Exxon spokesman Dave Parish said Exxon officials had not seen
Freeman's letter and would have no comment.
   Fund board member Byron I. Mallott, chief executive officer of
Sealaska Corp., suggested the board take the action. He said it
probably would have no major effect on the meeting other than to
make a point.
   ``This is one way that corporations speak to one another,''
Mallott said. ``We wanted to make a responsible statement without
being negative, without casting any kinds of aspersions. But we
also wanted to make it clear how seriously we consider the
circumstances that Exxon has essentially placed the state of Alaska
in.''
   Freeman said in his letter that he hopes Exxon will meet its
responsibility to clean up the spill, and that the Permanent Fund
will be able to vote its shares in subsequent annual meetings.
   The board's action Tuesday was unanimous. Mallott also said
Sealaska Corp., one of 13 regional native corporations established
under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, was withholding its
2,600 Exxon shares from voting.

<TEXT>
   The typical American household, nearly six
members strong when the nation was new, is down statistically to
just over 2{ people, a record low, the Census Bureau said Thursday.
   The decline reflects ``changes in the age structure of the
American population,'' said Census Bureau demographer Campbell
Gibson in a telephone interview.
   The household is shrinking as families have fewer children, more
young people set up housekeeping on their own and the number of
elderly maintaining their own households grows.
   There were 91.5 million households in the country as of last
July 1, the bureau said, with an average population of 2.62 people
each.
   That was down from 2.64 people a year earlier and 2.75 people in
the 1980 census, as the number of households in the country
continues to grow faster than the population as a whole.
   From 1980 to 1988, the number of households increased 13.9
percent, while the population rose 8.5 percent.
   Back in 1790, the first national census found that the typical
household contained 5.79 people.
   That was a time of extended families and generations living
together, circumstances which have become less common over time.
   ``More than anything else'' sid Gibson, ``decline in fertility''
has had an impact on household size.
   Between 1980 and 1987, the proportion of the total population
under age 18 dropped from 28.1 percent to 26 percent, he said.
   The nation's birth rate fell from 18.2 births per 1,000 people
in 1970 to 15.6 in 1987.
   In recent years, there has been an increase in the total number
of births, largely a result of the giant Baby Boom generation being
in its prime childbearing years.
   However, this generation is still reproducing at a lower rate
than the parents, resulting in fewer children per household.
   ``Total births are still nowhere near'' what they were in the
decade following World War II, Gibson said.
   This decline in young people is reflected in the maturing of
America's population, a change emphasized on Wednesday with a
separate Census Bureau report showing that the nation's median age
has risen to 32.3 years, its highest level ever.
   At the other end, pulling up the age, are members of the
post-World War II Baby Boom generation moving into middle age and
the growing number of elderly Americans whose lives have been
extended by improved medical care.
   With better health, more and more elderly maintain households on
their own, either as couples or alone, rather than living with
children or in group homes for older people or nursing homes.
   For example, in 1970 about 5 million people aged 65 and over
lived alone, while by 1987 that had risen to 8.5 million.
   In addition, many young people continue to set up housekeeping
on their own rather than forming families as they pursue education
and careers.
   In 1987, there were 6.5 million persons aged 25 to 44 living
alone, compared with just 1.6 million in 1970, census studies show.
   Gibson discounted the effect of the rise in divorce and
separation on household size, however, commenting that detailed
statistics are not available to determine this result.
   For example, a divorced couple may form two smaller households,
may remarry or one or both may go to live with parents or others.
   Family-oriented Utah was the only state with an average
household size of more than three, at 3.17, the bureau reported.
Florida and Oregon had the smallest average household size at 2.46.
   The household measure counts the number of persons residing in a
single housing unit. This can be a single person living alone or
any number of people sharing the home. The size of a household is
usually slightly smaller than that of a family, since it includes
single people while a family must include at least two related
individuals.
   Here is the average population in American households over the
years:

<HEAD>9 New England Investors Sue Blinder, Robinson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of New England investors has filed a
class-action lawsuit seeking to regain tens of thousands of dollars
from Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., a Denver penny-stock brokerage.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Hartford, Conn.,
claims the nine investors were defrauded in 1988 when they
purchased mortgage-backed securities, known as ``Fannie Maes.'' The
securities were bought on margin and brought heavy losses to the
investors, according to the lawsuit.
   A preliminary hearing, in which the investors are seeking
$600,000 from Blinder, Robinson to cover their known damages, is
set for Wednesday in Hartford.
   Teresa Leahy of Old Greenwich, Conn., said she and her husband
lost more than $15,000 in the investment program. ``It hurt because
we're on Social Security,'' she said. ``It takes a long time to get
that together.''
   The investors said they were told by salesmen for Blinder,
Robinson that they could make 40 percent to 60 percent profits in
three years with little risk. However, their investments were sold
in less than a year with substantial losses.
   Blinder, Robinson attorney Alan Jacobson responded to the suit
Thursday, saying, ``Our impression is there is no factual or legal
basis for this lawsuit.'' Jacobson said the brokerage ``does not
believe in litigating cases in the media. Each investor signed an
arbitration agreement, and such agreements are considered private.
I do not think very highly of people who don't honor their
contracts or of attorneys who run to the media.''
   Officials of the Federal National Mortgage Association wrote to
the brokerage last year, warning that it was failing to adequately
explain the risks involved in such securities and was exaggerating
yields. Fannie Mae is a government-chartered corporation that buys
and sells mortgages on the secondary market.
   No specific claims of overall monetary damages were cited in the
lawsuit because the amount could increase as more investors join
the action, said attorney Richard Weinstein.
   A federal judge still must rule on whether the lawsuit may
continue as a class action.

April.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 25.10 points from

alternative to gasoline, sponsors said Thursday.
   Participants in the Methanol Marathon, sponsored by General
Motors Corp. and the Society of Automotive Engineers, were scored
on technical skill in converting a conventional vehicle into a
methanol-burner and on performance, such as cold starts, emissions,
noise, acceleration and driving.
   The Tennessee team scored 764 points. They were followed by
Concordia University of Montreal, Canada, at 653 points, and the
Rochester, N.Y., Institute of Technology at 643 points.
   The Tennessee team averaged 19.9 miles per gallon over the
route, which began in Warren, Mich., outside of Detroit and ended
in College Park, Md.

<HEAD>Western Savings Reports Nearly $100 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Savings and Loan Association, which wiped
out the equity of its shareholders and fell below regulatory
capital guidelines at the end of 1988, on Thursday reported a $99.8
million first-quarter loss.
   The loss compares with one of $1.9 million for the first three
months of last year.
   It marks the second straight heavy quarterly loss for the
thrift, which has shrunk by $602 million in deposits and $773
million in assets since March 31, 1988.
   Chairman Robert W. Stallings, who took over April 3, said
continuing additions to real estate loan-loss reserves pushed the
thrift into another loss.
   Depositors should not worry, he said, because of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.'s standard guarantee on the first $100,000
of deposits in each account.
   However, he noted that the quarterly loss reduced Western's
regulatory net worth to $99 million. That is about 1.7 percent of
liabilities and less than half of what federal regulators have said
Western should maintain for stability.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in
light trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the U.S.
offer of subsidized grain to the Soviet Union continuing to have a
positive effect on wheat.
   Scattered showers in the Midwest forecast for Thursday night and
Friday kept corn and soybean prices under wraps.
   Wheat prices rallied on word that the People's Republic of China
may be interested in purchasing U.S. wheat. Prices also went up
with the announcement that the Soviet Union has ordered 300,000
metric tons of wheat under the program that subsidizes the sale of
U.S. grain to foreign countries.
   The White House announced earlier this week that it has offered
the Soviets 1.5 million metric tons of grain under the program.
   Trading in soybeans were lackluster, with slow movement of the
bean to market helping May prices, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst
with LIT America Inc. in Chicago.
   Forecasts for additional rain in Western crop states put
pressure on new crops as did word that the harvest of the Brazilian
soybean crop was 75 percent complete, Gidel said.
   Wheat closed 2{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in May at $4.35 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1{ cents
lower with May at $2.76 a bushel; oats were 3\ cent to 4} cents
higher with May at $1.91} a bushel; soybeans were 5{ cents lower to
2} cents higher with May at $7.49{ a bushel.

   The stock market drifted lower today, continuing
its week-long pullback as traders awaited the employment report for
April.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 25.10 points from
Monday through Wednesday, dropped another 13.20 to 2,380.50 by 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 656 up, 729 down and
531 unchanged.
   Wall Street attention has focused all week on Friday's scheduled
report from the Labor Department on the employment situation for
April.
   Analysts expect the data to serve as evidence of whether the
economy continued to slow last month after giving evidence of
losing some momentum in the first quarter.
   Hopes have been increasing on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve is succeeding in its campaign to cool down inflation
without tightening credit so much as to cause a recession.
   But that belief was challenged at the start of this week when a
trade association of corporate purchasing managers reported that
business activity picked up in April.

increase of 225,000 to 250,000 in nonfarm payrolls.

<TEXT>
   The Italian island of Capri wants no part
of Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.'s cigarette of the same name _
no part except a legal settlement, at least.
   A lawsuit the island filed against the Louisville-based tobacco
company goes to trial in Rome June 30.
   Capri officials say they do not want their paradise associated
with a potentially harmful product, and Brown &amp; Williamson has no
right to market a cigarette in Italy if Capri vetoes the plan.
   The manufacturer has contended the action is groundless because
the company has complied with ``all applicable laws in securing
rights to use the Capri name in Italy and in other countries where
the brand is sold,'' said comapny spokeswoman Valeris Oates.
   Oates said the company obtained necessary approvals from Italian
trademark officials and the nationally owned cigarette distribution
system.
   Browns &amp; Williamson sells Capri in 60 countries, including the
United States, where it went into national distribution last year.
Billed as the ``slimmest ultra-slim,'' the cigarette is aimed at
women.

<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. shareholders have tendered
more than 66 percent of the company's outstanding stock to MAI
Basic Four Inc. under a $20-per-share hostile takeover bid, MAI
said Thursday.
   The tender offer is still blocked by the U.S. District Court.
But MAI said this week it was preparing to satisfy the sole
remaining condition for ending the injunction by mailing Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s year-end financial statements to all Prime
stockholders.
   Judge A. David Mazzone previously ruled that the statements from
Drexel, MAI's investment bank and adviser, needed to be provided to
shareholders to comply with federal disclosure requirements. He
said he would lift the injunction 10 days after MAI certifies that
the statements have been sent out.
   MAI, based in Tustin, Calif., said it has extended its offer,
valued at about $970 million, until May 31.
   The injunction does not prevent stockholders from tendering
their shares, but it does block MAI, controlled by New York
investor Bennett S. LeBow, from taking ownership of the stock.
   Prime, based in Natick, is a minicomputer maker with the second
largest share of the market for computer aided design and
manufacturing systems. International Business Machines Corp. is the
leading CAD-CAM supplier.
   Prime's board of directors has rejected MAI's bid as too low. A
Prime spokeswoman, Paula Levis, said it is continuing to look for a
buyer willing to pay more than $20 per share.
   MAI also has announced plans to wage a proxy battle for control
of Prime's board at its June 14 annual meeting.

   A late buying spree in crude oil pushed
near-term contract prices higher Thursday and helped pull up prices
of gasoline and heating oil.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 48
cents to settle at $20.58 a barrel, after gaining 30 cents on
Wednesday. Longer-term contracts, however, were down by as much as
22 cents.
   Heating oil for June delivery ended the session up 0.73 cent at
48.59 cents a gallon. The contract had gained 0.25 cent in the
previous session.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
the June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline settled up 0.23
cent at 69.62 cents a gallon following Wednesday's loss of 1.86
cents. Longer-term contracts were slightly lower.
   Analysts said fear over supply pushed prices higher. They said
traders remained concerned over disruption in North Sea oil
production. Late Wednesday, Shell Exploration and Production Co.
said repairs on its Cormorant Alpha platform in the North Sea were
likely to take longer than anticipated, delaying the resumption of
operations until later this month.
   ``We're still seeing follow-through (buying) on that news,''
which broke late in the previous session, noted John Hill, vice
president at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   In addition, reports that Saudi Arabia is not exceeding its
production quota ``got the market rolling right back, recovering
all the ground it lost over the past two days,'' Hill said. Volume
was active.
   Gasoline prices showed the weakest gains. Analysts said
indications that refiners will be able to meet near-term demand
prevented gasoline from following crude prices sharply higher.

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds rose $1.2 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise to a record $304.17 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, followed a $435.5 million drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The latest increase puts money fund assets back on a
record-setting pace after last week's downturn, which represented
the first decline after fund assets posted new highs in each of the
previous 15 consecutive weeks.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 232 general purpose funds rose $119.8 million to $99.78
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds dropped $120.1 million to
$128.9 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds rose $1.2
billion to $75.5 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 9.15 percent from 9.19 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 9.16 percent from 9.15 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 34 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.63 percent as of Wednesday from 6.62 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged from a week earlier, at 5.15 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.34
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 9.51 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
9.32 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 9.32 percent; and 9.20
percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

<TEXT>
   As Donald Trump's agreement to buy
Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel is called into question by the
casino's state-appointed conservator, at least five higher offers
have been made to purchase the financially troubled gaming hall.
   The latest offer came Thursday from Bob Stupak, owner of Vegas
World Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas, Nev., who offered $64 million for
the Atlantis _ $1 million higher than Trump's signed agreement.
   Trump intends to close the Atlantis' casino and operate the
facility as a hotel, but Stupak said he would keep the casino open.
   Joseph M. Nolan, the conservator operating the Atlantis since
its license expired April 14, said he is accepting inquiries from
anyone who wants to submit purchase offers.
   Nolan told the state Casino Control Commission that he questions
the validity of Trump's agreement with Elsinore Corp. because it
may have been signed after he became conservator.
   All the new bids would keep the Atlantis casino intact, Nolan
said.
   Trump was not available for comment Thursday, said his secretary
in New York, Norma Foerderer.
   In Las Vegas, Stupak, 47, is known as a colorful character. He
ran for mayor in 1987 and lost in a close race. Earlier this year,
he won a $1 million bet on the Super Bowl.

   The dollar finished at varied levels against
major foreign currencies Thursday as Federal Reserve intervention
and a comment by the central bank's vice chairman sent mixed
signals to the markets.
   Gold prices ended with minor losses in U.S. trading after moving
ahead overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a troy
ounce of gold bullion at $376.70 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
Wednesday's late bid of $377.40.
   Foreign exchange dealers in the United States said the dollar
headed higher after Fed Governor Manuel Johnson indicated the
dollar's strength is not a problem as far as the central bank's
policies are concerned.
   Later, traders detected that the Fed sold dollars when the U.S.
currency was trading at 1.8960 West German marks. The intervention
did little to discourage buyers, though, and the dollar ended the
day at 1.89575 marks, up from 1.89325 on Wednesday.
   Thomas Palladino, an assistant vice president at Amsterdam
Rotterdam Bank in New York, described the Fed's action as a largely
symbolic attempt to put the currency markets on notice that the
central bank won't tolerate significantly higher dollar levels.
   Activity in the markets was held down by traders' reluctance to
establish new positions ahead of Friday's release of U.S.
unemployment figures for April, which will furnish one of the first
indications of how the economy performed last month.
   A reduction in the nation's jobless rate and an expansion in
payrolls could push the dollar higher and cause government
authorities to intervene.
   European currency and precious metals trading was lighter than
usual because many markets were closed for Ascension Day. Financial
markets in West Germany, Switzerland, France and the Netherlands
were closed.
   Japanese markets also were closed for a holiday.
   The dollar traded late in London at 133.95 Japanese yen, up from
the late London rate on Wednesday of 133.93 yen. Later, in New
York, the dollar was quoted at 134.195 yen, down from 134.295 on
Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6841 late Thursday, cheaper
for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6847. Sterling fetched $1.68125
in later New York dealing, a weakening from Wednesday's $1.6820.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared to Wednesday rates,
included: 1.69105 Swiss francs, up from 1.68705; 1.18305 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.18415; 6.4005 French francs, up from 6.3905;
and 1,384.50 Italian lire, up from 1,383.05.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.8915 West German marks, up from 1.8900;
1.6860 Swiss francs, up from 1.6830; 6.3875 French francs, up from
6.3725; 2.1290 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1270; 1,380.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,379.00, and 1.1841 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1830.
   Gold and silver turned in mixed performances in trading around
the world.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
settled at $377.70 a troy ounce, down from $378.40 on Wednesday.
   The late bid price for gold in London was $378.25 a troy ounce,
up from $377.97 late Wednesday. The market was closed in Zurich.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $378.45 bid, up from
$376.55.
   Silver bullion closed on New York's Comex at $5.613 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's settlement of $5.635. Silver bullion
traded late in London at a bid $5.66 a troy ounce, up from
Wednesday's $5.65.

   Donald J. Trump, a consummate
player in the high-stakes world of big business, was the new game
in town Thursday as he toured Milton Bradley Co. to herald new
editions of ``Trump The Game.''
   Women workers screeched as he passed by, and one cried when he
bussed her on the cheek. ``He kissed me! He kissed me!'' said a
shaky Grace Adams of Springfield, Mass., who has worked 31 years at
the company.
   The real estate mogul flew to the western Massachusetts factory
of 2,300 workers in the huge black Trump helicopter to fulfill a
promise to the company that expects ``Trump The Game'' to be the
biggest seller in its 129-year history, despite its $25 pricetag.
   ``They were intent on having me come up to meet the real
people,'' Trump said. ``These are the people doing the work. To
hell with the executives.''
   Employees clapped at each stop in the 45-minute visit, women
sighed ``Isn't he handsome?'' and men lined up for autographs on
the paper money that bears his likeness and comes in denominations
no smaller than $10 million.
   More than 2 million games are scheduled for production by year's
end. It is the No. 1 seller in the 300 stores that have received
advance copies, Milton Bradley President George Ditomassi said.
   Neither the company nor Trump will disclose his royalties, but
both said he is donating proceeds to charities for the homeless and
for research on AIDS, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.
   The board game is a sophisticated battle in which players first
bid against each other _ using Trump cards, of course _ for
airlines, casinos, luxury hotels and other Trump properties, then
try to negotiate deals.
   ``If you don't do well at this game, you should stay on
9-to-5,'' Trump advised, adding that the game is tough even for a
veteran like him.
   But he resisted explaining its appeal. ``If I said it, you'd say
I have a big ego, so why say it?''
   Although several game manufacturers tried to peddle their ideas
to Trump, the one that caught his eye came from an independent
inventor from Chicago who suggested Milton Bradley as a
manufacturer.
   Trump said he settled on the nation's largest board game maker,
because ``the loyalty, decisiveness and professionalism of this
company is just unbelievable.'' As the applause died down, he
barked at workers: ``OK, get some overtime.''
   Trump later denied rumors that he planned to run for mayor of
New York, which had surfaced with a recent full-page newspaper ad
he took out supporting the death penalty.
   And he sneered at the suggestion that a new bidder for
strikebound Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle could affect his
$365 million offer for the service. ``It's not serious,'' he said
of Wednesday's bid from regional carrier America West Airlines. ``I
have not even heard of them.''
   Besides, Trump said, his contract with Eastern guarantees him a
lot of money even if the deal falls through. ``They'll pay me a
fairly substantial amount of money and I'll go home,'' he said.
``But I would rather get it.''
   Under the contract, Trump would receive $8 million from Eastern
if the deal isn't consummated, according to sources close to the
situation.
   Trump declined to jibe at cartoonist Garry Trudeau for the comic
series that depicted him as a mogul with an overriding ego. ``I
think it's an honor,'' he said. ``Garry Trudeau is a talented guy.''

<HEAD>Mediators Seeks Meeting Between ABC and Engineers Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal mediator intervened Thursday in a
dispute between Capital Cities-ABC Inc. and its engineers' union in
an effort to get both sides to return to the bargaining table.
   The workers on Wednesday rejected what the network called its
final offer.
   The National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians
wants to meet May 11 but the company says that's too late.
   The mediator, Kenneth Kowalski, said he would not call a meeting
until both sides agree on a time, place and date for it.
   The union offered to meet May 11 at 10 a.m. in Washington at the
offices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service,
according to NABET spokesman John Krieger.
   Patti Matson, an ABC spokeswoman, said the company felt May 11
would not leave time for the union membership to vote again on the
offer.
   ABC's offer includes a 10 percent bonus in the first year of the
pact if it is ratified by May 15. The lump sum payment drops to 3
percent if it is ratified after May 15.
   Union leaders have ruled out a reconsideration vote, and so far,
the members have not authorized a strike.

<HEAD>Broad Money Supply Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended April 24, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,082.8 billion from $3,086.6 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$3,969.4 billion from $3,969.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $787.3 billion from $781.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,071.4 billion, a 1.8
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of decline from the
previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,948.0 billion, down 3.8 percent,
while M1 slipped 0.9 percent to an average of $785.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $687 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$476 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $290.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $288.3 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Investigation Throws New York Markets Off Stride</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A sweep by federal agents through New York commodity markets
helped slow trading somewhat on Thursday, analysts said.
   Trading slowed at the New York Mercantile Exchange in
mid-session on news that the government had subpoenaed the records
of several firms and traders in connection with a criminal
investigation of trading practices at that market and other New
York futures exchanges.
   Energy futures were mixed on the Mercantile Exchange as crude
oil futures rose over increased concern with North Sea oil
production. In other markets, grain and soybean futures were mixed;
livestock prices were higher and pork futures lower, and precious
metals were mixed.
   Traders pushed crude oil prices higher on news that the full
flow of oil exports from the North Sea's Brent complex may not
resume as soon as expected. Production was disrupted in April by a
platform explosion.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 48 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in June at $20.58 a barrel;
heating oil was .03 cent lower to .73 cent higher with June at
48.59 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent lower to .23
cent higher with June at 69.62 cents a gallon.
   Trading slowed on word of criminal and civil investigations of
four of the five New York futures exchanges. Federal agents issued
subpoenas for information the markets, seized records at one firm
and subpoenaed more than 50 traders.
   Exchange and U.S. Postal Service officials said authorities were
seeking information about trading practices by firms and
individuals.
   ``Trading was well below that of yesterday, and (today's)
problems may have may have been a factor,'' Robert Baker, an
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, said
Thursday.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in light trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices rallied on word that the Peoples Republic of China
may be interested in purchasing U.S. wheat. Prices also were
affected by the announcement that the Soviet Union has ordered
300,000 metric tons of wheat under the program that subsidizes the
sale of U.S. grain to foreign countries.
   The White House announced earlier this week it has offered the
Soviets 1.5 million metric tons of grain.
   Soybean trading was was lackluster, with slow movement of the
crop to market helping May prices, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst
with LIT America Inc. in Chicago. Forecasts for additional rain in
western crop states put pressure on soybeans and corn, Gidel said.
   Wheat was 2{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with May at $4.35 a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $2.75} a
bushel; oats were 3\ cent to 4} cents higher with May at $1.91} a
bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents lower to 3\ cents higher with May at
$7.50 a bushel.
   Precious metals were mixed on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold was $2.10 lower to .70 cents higher with May at $377.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.2 cents to 2.3 cents lower with May at
$5.613 cents a troy ounce.
   Livestock futures prices were mixed and pork futures were lower
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle prices were boosted by the aggressive marketing of
cattle at higher prices.
   Live hog futures were forced lower by concern over heavy
marketings and declines in cash prices, said Phil Stanley, an
independent trader, who added there also was concern prices would
continue to weaken.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .13 cent higher, with June at
72.55; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .35 cent higher with May at
76.95 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .30 cent higher
with June at 47.10 a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to
.30 cent higher with May at 30.82 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Vanik, Jewish Leader Propose Easing Curbs On Soviet Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-author of a 1972 law that curbed
American trade with the Soviet Union called on President Bush and
Congress today to waive the restriction for one year to encourage
further improvements in human rights under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The process under way appears to be in earnest,'' said Charles
A. Vanik, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio who sponsored
the law with the late Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., that is
designed to force increased Jewish emigration.
   Vanik's plea was endorsed by Meyer Berger, a member of the board
of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. He said a waiver would
help stabilize U.S.-Soviet relations and ``send a message that
American Jews recognize the great change in the human rights
process under Gorbachev.''
   The board is due to take up the question of U.S. trade
restrictions at a meeting here next month. Berger, of Pittsburgh,
said he was not speaking for the board.
   The law, known as Jackson-Vanik, denied the Soviet Union the
trading privileges accorded most nations unless Jews were allowed
to emigrate freely.
   Last month, 4,557 Jews left, the highest monthly figure since
October of 1979, the year emigration reached an annual high of
51,320.
   Vanik projected an exodus this year of 38,000 to 43,000. He had
called for a waiver, which is permitted under the law, in 1979, as
well.
   Besides increased Jewish emigration, the former congressman
cited a pledge by Soviet President Gorbachev to abolish all laws
restricting religious and cultural practices.
   ``We cannot expect instant democracy,'' he said in a speech at a
luncheon sponsored by the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet
relations, a private group that seeks reconciliation between the
superpowers. ``We must measure progress in the Soviet Union from
ground zero.''
   Vanik placed himself between proponents of outright repeal of
the law and ``hardliners'' in Congress who, he said, ``will resist
any accommodation with the Soviet Union.''
   He said only about a dozen countries are denied what is known
technically as ``most-favored nation'' trading status. These
include Albania, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Laos and Romania.
   Vanik said trade with Iran and South Africa is only partially
impeded.
   Even Colombia, the South American country Vanik said is the
major drug supplier to the United States, enjoys
most-favored-nation privileges, he said.
   Berger said a waiver would improve trade and also boost
emigration, providing Israel with skilled Russian immigrants. He
said it also might facilitate the resumption of diplomatic
relations between Jerusalem and Moscow.
   Martin A. Wenick, executive director of the Jewish group, said
at a news conference earlier that in reassessing its position on
Jackson-Vanik the board would consider various factors.
   He said these included whether visas were issued to some 600
long-term ``refusenik'' families _ Jews waiting for years for
permission to emigrate.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seek Administration's Views On CNW Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four congressmen asked the Bush administration on
Thursday to examine a New York investor group's efforts to acquire
CNW Corp., the parent of the Chicago and North Western railroad.
   The Federal Railroad Administration, a government agency, holds
about $143 million in low-interest notes from Chicago-based CNW,
which makes CNW's business the public's business as well, the
congressmen said.
   They aired the concerns in letters to Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Richard
Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
   John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Committee on Energy
and Commerce, urged Brady and Darman to talk with Skinner ``to
develop a coordinated administration approach in the event that
protection of the federal government's ... financial interest with
respect to this proposed acquisition becomes necessary.''
   The letters were also signed by energy committee member Norman
Lent, R-NY, and House transportation subcommittee members Thomas
Luken, D-Ohio, and Bob Whittaker, R-Kan.
   The railroad administration loaned CNW the money in 1977 and
1978 for repairs to the railroad's primary east-west track and
other facilities.
   The congressmen asked the Bush administration members to respond
by May 10.
   Japonica Partners, a limited partnership based in New York,
offered on April 27 to buy CNW for $44 a share, or $658 million for
all the CNW stock that Japonica does not already own. Japonica owns
about 8.8 percent of CNW's stock.
   The companies have been sparring since then, with each side
accusing the other of refusing to negotiate fairly.
   On Thursday, Japonica filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Delaware charging CNW's board of directors with refusing to
negotiate in good faith.
   CNW called the lawsuit ``baseless.''
   Japonica also is waging a proxy fight, asking CNW shareholders
to elect three of its nominees to CNW's board of directors at the
company's May 16 annual meeting.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Executives Talk About Free Press Future</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Detroit Free Press' parent company Thursday
affirmed its commitment to the newspaper and to pursuing a
long-stalled joint operating agreement with The Detroit News.
   ``We are firmly committed to continue to publish an excellent
and competitive newspaper in Detroit,'' Knight-Ridder Inc.
President James Batten said in a Thursday news release.
   When the U.S. Supreme Court decided Monday to hear a challenge
of the JOA, with a decision expected next year, some analysts
wondered if Miami-based Knight-Ridder would be willing to absorb
the Free Press' losses for another year.
   But the company's board of directors Thursday unanimously agreed
to continue publishing the newspaper while the appeal is pending.
   ``Although we are disappointed by the delay necessitated by the
Supreme Court's decision to review the case, we remain confident
that the court will affirm the actions of the attorney general and
the lower courts,'' Batten said.
   The Free Press and The News, the latter owned by Gannett Co.
Inc., have sought the partial merger since 1986. The papers aim to
cut costs by combining advertising, circulation and production
operations while keeping separate news and editorial departments.
   The Free Press lost $22.7 million in 1988, Knight-Ridder said in
the statement. Gannett hasn't released annual loss figures, but has
said The News lost $64.95 million from 1980 through 1987.
   While the JOA ruling is pending, the Free Press will try to keep
its losses to 1988 levels, Knight-Ridder said.
   And in concert with The News, it will reopen contract
negotiations at once with both newspapers' unions. More than 3,000
union employees have gone without contractual raises since 1986.
   Knight-Ridder has said it would close the Free Press if the JOA
were denied.

<HEAD>U.S. Expertise Sought for Japanese Aid Program, Official Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American engineers, builders, suppliers and
development experts have an opportunity to earn some of the
trillions of yen Japan plans to pour into overseas economic aid in
the coming years, U.S. aid chief Alan Woods said Thursday.
   Japan, about to replace the United States as the world's largest
foreign aid donor, is interested in making use of U.S. expertise,
Woods, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, told
reporters.
   Britain has already responded to the Japanese desire for expert
collaboration and ``the British have become procurement agents for
the Japanese aid agency throughout East Africa,'' he said.
   Woods announced that AID is sponsoring conferences in San
Francisco May 10-ll and Orlando, Florida, May 15-16 to help
American enterprises on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts learn about
opportunities in the Japanese overseas development program.
Officials from three Japanese aid agencies will participate in both
meetings, the first such sessions ever held, he said.
   The Japanese have only about 200 foreign aid specialists and
appear eager to draw on the experience of more than 2,000 Americans
working on AID programs, Woods said.
   There is no formal agreement on collaboration between the two
countries' agencies, Woods said in answer to a question. But
foreign participation in Japanese-financed programs outside Japan
is governed by conditions different from those for Japanese
domestic projects, where difficult negotiations were held last year
to gain access for U.S. contractors, he added.
   In Japanese foreign aid, the receiving country has the
responsibility for organizing competitive bidding on projects, it
was pointed out.
   Japan plans to spend $50 billion on overseas economic aid in the
next five years, with the emphasis on building dams, power stations
and transmission facilities, roads, railways, telecommunications,
factories and water management projects, AID officials said.
American aid in recent years has shifted from such major capital
projects to technical assistance, they said.
   Foreign firms are already increasing their share of contracts in
the Japanese aid program, but the U.S. share is dropping, strongly
suggesting ``that the competitive environment has become more
favorable but that potential America bidders are not widely aware
of it,'' an AID announcement said.
   The idea that Japanese aid is tied to the use of Japanese firms
and products is becoming obsolete, and today, ``less than half of
the total is tied,'' said Jerome Sherry, chief of AID's development
assistance staff. By contrast, about two-thirds of the current
year's U.S. aid spending of about $8.5 billion is tied to U.S.
firms and goods, he said in answer to a question.
   Japanese aid has so far have emphasized Asia. The proposed
multibillion-dollar Multilateral Aid Initiative for the
Philippines, led by the United States, Japan, West European
countries and the World Bank, is expected to be the largest program
in any single country.
   The United States and Japan have consulted on projects for
Indonesia and India and potential new progams in Africa, Weeks said.
   He said Koichiro Matsura, director general of the Japanese
Foreign Ministry economic cooperation bureau, voiced interest in
U.S. collaboration when they met in Manila last December.

<HEAD>Beatrice Denies Concealing Evidence in Pollution Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beatrice Foods Co. has denied that it conspired to
withhold engineering reports and other documents from the families
of leukemia victims who lost a 1986 lawsuit charging the
conglomerate with polluting their drinking water.
   In papers filed late Wednesday in federal court, the company and
its lawyers said they did not ``intentionally conceal'' anything
and said the families had presented no evidence of a conspiracy.
   ``Neither Beatrice nor its counsel intentionally concealed any
documents or information from the plaintiffs or engaged in any
conspiracy to conceal,'' Beatrice attorney Jerome Facher wrote.
   The filing was the latest round in a long-running legal battle
between the families and the Chicago-based food conglomerate. The
families' attorney, Jan Schlichtmann, is appealing the jury verdict
in the case and seeking a new trial.
   In a brief filed last month, Schlichtmann charged that Beatrice
and its Boston law firm, Hale &amp; Dorr, engaged in ``misconduct'' by
concealing documents that could have influenced the case.
Schlichtmann has asked U.S. District Judge Walter Jay Skinner to
find Beatrice in default.
   Under orders from the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Skinner
is conducting an unusual post-trial hearing into the fairness of
the trial he presided over three years ago. His first task is to
determine whether Beatrice willingly concealed evidence. If so, he
will hold a hearing into whether the evidence was relevant.
   Skinner made no immediate ruling in response to Beatrice's
filing and was not expected to rule until later this month.

<HEAD>Wall Street's Verdict: Insurers Lost</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Proposition 103</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both sides are claiming degrees of victory in
the court fight over California's insurance rate-slashing
Proposition 103, but the verdict on Wall Street was unequivocal:
The insurance companies lost.
   Stock prices for several insurers heavily committed to the
California market fell Thursday after the state Supreme Court
upheld most of the voter-approved ballot measure.
   ``We're all sitting here looking at our screens, watching the
stock drop,'' said G. Alan Zimmermann, who follows the industry for
Smith Barney, Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Investor skittishness was most evident among smaller insurers
with significant amounts of their business in auto or property and
casualty lines in California.
   Stock in 20th Century Industries dropped $1.87{ to $23.37{ per
share; Mercury General Corp. fell $1.50 to $15 a share; Safeco fell
$2.12{ to $26.50 a share, and Fireman's Fund fell 62{ cents to
$33.62{ a share.
   Larger companies presumably are less prone to be hurt by
regulatory decisions in any one state, but stock prices declined
for at least two big insurers which do at least 10 percent of their
property and casualty business in California. Chubb Corp. was down
$1.62{ to $64.62{ and Cigna declined 37{ cents to $52.50.
   The court unanimously upheld most provisions of the measure,
which requires insurers to submit rate hikes to state regulators
for approval, outlaws territorial rating, creates an elected job of
Insurance Commissioner and requires a good-driver discount
beginning in November, the first anniversary of Proposition 103's
passage.
   But the justices weakened the most controversial of Prop 103's
provisions: An immediate rate cut to 20 percent below November 1987
level.
   Prop 103 would have spared insurers the rate cut only if they
could prove it threatened them with insolvency. The court eased
that standard, ruling insurance companies are entitled to a ``fair
rate of return.''
   The measure was triggered by dramatic increases in the price of
car insurance, but affects most property and casualty coverage as
well.
   Wall Street analysts called the ruling bad news for the
business, but noted the rollback section softened the blow somewhat.
   However, Smith Barney's Zimmerman suggested a freshly elected
insurance commissioner would be unlikely to be generous in granting
exemptions.
   Confusion in the market likely will continue because of
uncertainty in interpreting the court's ``fair return'' standard,
said A. Michael Frinquelli, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New
York.
   ``I think the turmoil now simply shifts from the Supreme Court
to the Insurance Commissioner's office,'' Frinquelli said.
   Another analyst, Marvin Shulman of Moody's Investors Service,
suggested that any rate cuts would be delayed by appeals and
administrative filings, thus blunting any immediate effect of the
ballot measure on insurers' earnings.

   The House and Senate approved on Thursday $1.2
trillion budgets which uphold a much-criticized agreement with
President Bush to reduce the deficit without cutting spending or
significantly raising taxes.
   Each chamber rejected several attempts to overhaul their
blueprints for tax and spending policy in fiscal 1990 and then
ratified the packages strongly in their final votes.
   The House approved its plan 263-157, after budget committee
chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., called it ``the only choice for us
to fulfill our budget responsibilities and avoid crisis.''
   The Senate then passed its version, 68-31, after some minor
tinkering and much grumbling that the deficit reduction in it was
inadequate.
   ``It's clearly an attempt for this administration to be able to
muddle its way through its first year,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, who was the Democrats' vice presidential candidate last
year.
   Both chambers on Thursday overwhelmingly rejected more ambitious
proposals to ``freeze'' government spending and cut further into
the deficit. The House also soundly defeated a proposal to cut red
ink by taxing imported oil, a day after the Senate went on record
against a gasoline tax boost.
   As laid out by the White House agreement, the budgets claim to
shrink the federal deficit to just below $100 billion, as required
by the Gramm-Rudman law. They would allow federal programs to grow
but, especially at the Pentagon, at less than the rate of inflation.
   More than half of the nearly $28 billion in claimed ``savings''
would be from higher revenues _ sales of government assets, higher
fees for government services, and $5.3 billion in unspecified tax
increases.
   Critics said too much of the deficit reduction would be achieved
through false accounting and gimmicks which do nothing to address
the government's long-term fiscal imbalance.
   Defenders of the plan said more could be done later. They
described the budget as the first step in a continuing
deficit-reduction effort with the White House _ a cooperation
marking a sharp change from the years of budget warfare during the
Reagan administration.
   ``It's minimal, manageable, done collaboratively,'' said Sen.
Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee, who argued that the long-term fruits of the new spirit
of bipartisan cooperation were ``immeasurable.''
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said the rosy economic assumptions
used to calculate the lower deficit figures were ``somewhere
between unlikely and preposterous.''
   ``This budget can, at the most charitable, be characterized as a
slide-by budget,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who said many
lawmakers were frustrated by the constraints of the White House
agreement.
   While some may have been frustrated, it appeared most were
willing to go along in putting off any more ambitious
deficit-reduction efforts until later.
   House Democratic and Republican leaders cooperated to assure
passage Thursday of their chamber's version of the budget, ruling
out in advance any amendments which threatened to upset the
delicate pact worked out in weeks of talks with the White House.
   Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the new No. 2 Republican in the House,
urged ``everyone on our side to vote for the bipartisan package.''
In past years, Gingrich and other House GOP members rarely
supported a budget in significant numbers.
   The Senate, meantime, appeared resignd to its own version of the
plan.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, noted that the Senate
was accomplishing in two days what often has taken two weeks or
more. The Senate even took time off from its budget debate Thursday
to consider a resolution on the elections in Panama.
   The House and Senate must reconcile their competing versions of
the budget before it becomes final. That should be an easier task
than usual this year, because the broad outlines for federal
spending were set in the bipartisan agreement.
   Military spending was set at $299.2 billion, about the same as
this year, and $4.2 billion less than needed to keep pace with
inflation. Total Pentagon obligations, including those which spread
past the end of fiscal 1990, were capped at $305.5 billion.
   About $17 billion would be set aside for foreign aid.
   The House and Senate versions both, under the agreement, call
for cost-cutting in entitlement programs, including Medicare
payments to doctors and hospitals and farm subsidies.
   The agreement set an overall cap for domestic spending and the
two chambers took somewhat different approaches. The House
allocated slightly more for education and health while the Senate
favored agriculture, energy and law enforcement.
   Both chambers voted during their debates to increase spending
for veterans health care well above the president's request, to
address problems in that system.
   The House plan contains more specifics, but both envision $2.7
billion in new fees for government services. Targets for the new
fees include boat owners, the nuclear power industry and
broadcasters. A current fee for veterans home loans, due to expire,
would be extended.
   The $5.7 billion in assets sales called for under the agreement
remain mostly unspecified _ as is the next largest revenue source,
the $5.3 billion in taxes.
   Bush has said the tax money should be generated by cutting the
tax rate on capital gains. But Democrats say cutting that rate is a
big revenue loser in the long run, and the wealthy would benefit
the most.
   In seeking to avoid the impact of the Gramm-Rudman law _ which
calls for across-the-board spending cuts if the deficit projections
later soar $10 billion above its $100 billion target _ the budgets
and White House agreement relied on various accounting moves.
   For example:
   _$850 million in payments for farmers scheduled for fiscal 1990
would be moved up to before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.
   _$477 million in ``savings'' is claimed by writing off food
stamps which were issued but never used.
   _Credit is claimed for $88 million not spent when Congress
rejected its pay raise earlier this year.

   West Point-Pepperell Inc. announced
Thursday it has hired Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to look at
options for selling or reorganizing West Point-Pepperell's men's
apparel division.
   The company said Drexel will explore alternatives including the
sale of all or parts of its Cluett Peabody division, a management
buyout and other forms of reorganization.
   The Cluett Peabody division manufactures and markets men's
shirts, suits and hosiery under the Arrow, Colours by Alexander
Julian, Burberry and Gold Toe labels.
   Chicago-based Farley Industries Inc. recently completed its $3
billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell and is now the world's
largest textile and apparel manufacturer. Farley has said it plans
to sell part of West Point-Pepperell's non-bed-and-bath business to
reduce debt associated with the acquisition.
   William Farley, chairman of Farley, announced Wednesday that the
company will invest $12 million at West Point-Pepperell plants in
Hamilton, N.C., and Lumberton, N.C., creating nearly 500 new jobs.
   ``West Point-Pepperell today reminds me of Fruit of the Loom
when Farley Industries acquired it three years ago in a leveraged
buyout,'' Farley said.
   ``Since then, we've invested $340 million to make it a better
company. That's more than seven times what was invested during the
three years before we bought it. We've also added 9,000 workers.
Fruit of the Loom now employs 22,000 American textile and apparel
workers, all in the South,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines announced Thursday that it has
temporarily suspended maintenance operations at New York's John F.
Kennedy International Airport due to concern about the work
performed there.
   Eastern said investigations by the company and the Federal
Aviation Administration have raised questions about some work
performed at Kennedy Airport before the airline's union workers
walked out March 4.
   It said several supervisors had be reassigned to other duties
pending the completion of the probes. No action was taken against
non-supervisory workers represented by the Machinists union because
those workers are not on the company payroll due to the strike.
   A company audit of all maintenance performed at JFK and
throughout its system from July 1988 to February 1989 showed all
aircraft now in service were maintained to the highest standards,
Eastern said in a statement.
   The temporary suspension of maintenance was not expected to
affect flight operations, Eastern said.
   JFK is not being served under Eastern's current reduced
schedule. The company is only flying a fraction of its pre-strike
flights as it reorganizes under bankruptcy court protection.

   Avon Products Inc.'s chairman reiterated at
Thursday's annual shareholders meeting that the cosmetics giant
intends to remain independent and focus on its core beauty and
direct selling businesses.
   The assertion came a day after Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs
and rival Amway Corp. disclosed they had amassed a 10.3 percent
stake in Avon and might seek to acquire the company.
   But talk at the Avon meeting was dominated by animal rights
issues, not takeovers, as shareholders rejected a proposal to force
the company to disclose details of animal testing used for its
products.
   Chairman and Chief Executive James Preston got prolonged
applause when he opened the crowded meeting by saying, ``I want to
make it clear that Avon is not for sale.''
   Avon is completing the divestiture of its unprofitable
health-care services operations, which include nursing homes,
retirement living facilities and substance abuse treatment centers,
making this ``the worst time to sell'' the rest of the company,
Preston said.
   In addition, ``our distribution and selling systems _ to say
nothing of our culture and values _ are enormously different from
Amway. We see more conflicts than commonalities,'' he said.
   In March 1988, Avon's board approved a ``poison pill'' stock
plan aimed at making an unwanted takeover prohibitively expensive.
The plan was designed to ``encourage prospective acquirors to
negotiate with the board (and) ... deter takeover abuses,''
according to Avon's proxy statement.
   Some 54 percent of the shares voted on Thursday favored putting
the plan to a shareholder vote, but it did not constitute a
majority of the shares outstanding needed to pass the resolution.
   Only one shareholder voiced support for a takeover, saying that
``Irwin Jacobs and Amway have done more for the share price in the
last few days than management has done in the last year.''
   Preston said Avon stock _ which rose nearly $4 a share over the
past two days _ still did not reflect the value of its basic
businesses. The stock closed down 87{ cents Thursday at $36 in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Preston forecast that Avon should grow ``at least as fast as the
beauty industry, which is about 2 or 3 percent in real terms.'' He
said the international direct selling business and retail sales of
the company's Giorgio, Red and Uninhibited fragrances should lead
sales growth.
   Preston conceded that Avon's financial condition is ``not
strong.'' He said in the next five years Avon will attempt to halve
its debt _ which should total less than $1 billion at the end of
1989 and noted that cost-cutting measures will be offset somewhat
by severance payments to employees.
   Many securities analysts attending the meeting were more
concerned about how Avon's preferred shareholders would fare in the
face of a takeover.
   Preferred shares are convertible to roughly $34 in cash or to
one share of common stock. Preston stressed he would not speculate
about what action the company would take against a takeover.
   Most of the two-hour meeting was dominated by animal rights
issues. Preston's disclosure that Avon ``has not done any testing
on animals since March 15'' did little to calm more than a dozen
animal supporters attending the meeting.
   Shareholders ultimately defeated a proposal that would have
required Avon to disclose the number of animals and their species
used each year in both in-house and contract laboratories and
procedures that involve pain.
   Of the shares that voted on the proposal, 10.1 percent supported
it, which the special interest group People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals construed as somewhat of a victory. Last year,
a similar proposal garnered 6 percent of the vote.
   Several animal rights activitsts _ including one dressed as a
rabbit _ carried placards outside the posh Pierre Hotel on Fifth
Avenue, site of the meeting.

<HEAD>Exchange Market Reopens, Austral Weakens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina's currency exchange
market, closed for five days, reopened Wednesday and the austral,
the national currency that has been battered by recent plunges in
value, fell by 11.6 percent during the day's trading.
   The country also began adjusting to a new package of economic
measures, including price freezes and utility and fuel price
increases, that took effect Tuesday in a government effort to slow
triple-digit inflation.
   Argentines bought U.S. dollars for 76 australs apiece Wednesday
morning, and 86 australs at market closing, compared with 106
australs at one point last week.
   Those who sold dollars received 74 australs in the morning and
84 australs at the closing.
   Only 17 australs were required to buy a dollar in early February.
   The opening austral-dollar quotation was similar to that of last
Thursday, the most recent day the market operated. The Central
Bank, saying it had run short of the local currency, declared an
exchange holiday on Friday and, following a long May 1 weekend,
extended it until Wednesday.
   The reopening of the exchange market followed the announcement
Monday night of a new plan by the government of President Raul
Alfonsin to control inflation, which totaled 392.8 percent for the
12 months ended March 31. April inflation was expected to be 30 to
40 percent.
   The plan, which included a 45-day freeze on prices of most goods
and services, a 20 percent hike in utility rates and 25 percent
increase in gasoline prices and early payment of an annual mid-year
bonus to workers, went into effect Tuesday.
   The new measures were meant ``to bring peace to markets, stop
inflation and protect the needy,'' said Economy Minister Juan
Carlos Pugliese in a Tuesday night speech to the nation. He
observed, however, that those objectives ``are not easy to obtain''
in current cirumstances marked by ``uncertainty over the future.''
   Uncertainty stems, in part, from national elections, scheduled
for May 14, in which Argentines will pick a successor for Alfonsin,
whose term expires on Dec. 10. Opposition Peronist Party candidate
Carlos Menem leads Eduardo Angeloz, candidate for the ruling Civic
Radical Union, in most polls.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Sells Kroger Holding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which held
nearly 10 percent of the stock of Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. from
a takeover attempt, apparently dumped its shares Wednesday.
   A 7.8-million-share block of Kroger stock was sold to an
unidentified buyer at 3:45 p.m., 15 minutes before the end of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, it was reported by the Dow
Jones news wire.
   Although the identity of the seller was not disclosed, a proxy
statement recently issued by Kroger said Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
was the only investor holding that much stock in the grocery chain.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a New York investment firm, bought the
stock nine months ago in an attempt to buy the chain.
   By the end of the day, 8.4 million shares of Kroger stock had
traded, making the stock the most active on the exchange Wednesday.
Kroger stock closed at $11.12{ down 50 cents, Wednesday.
   The buyout firm made a profit in the neighborhood of $19 million
on the sale of the 7.8-million-share block. KKR bought its
7,875,000 shares last October at $7.63 to $9.25 per share, or a
total of about $68.5 million.
   Kroger earlier rejected KKR's purchase offers. KKR later said it
was only interested in the stock as an investment.
   Kroger, operator of supermarkets, convenience stores and
food-processing plants, is undergoing a $4.6 billion reorganization
it began last fall in part to fight off takeover bids by KKR and
Dart Group Inc. of Landover, Md.
   Kroger spokesman Paul Bernish declined comment on the stock
movement. Thomas Daly, a representative of KKR, also refused
comment.
   ``Maybe they just decided they would use their cash in something
more aggressive,'' said Kimberly Walin, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
