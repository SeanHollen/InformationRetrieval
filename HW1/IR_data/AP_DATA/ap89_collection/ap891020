<HEAD>Mother Throws 3-Week-Old Baby From Third-Floor Window</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-week-old girl survived being thrown out of
a third-floor window by her mother Friday when she landed in mud
left by days of steady rain, authorities said.
   ``She has a skull fracture, she appears to have a femur fracture
and we're concerned about intra-abdominal injuries,'' Dr. Bruce
Klein said. ``I think she is a very, very lucky baby.''
   Salonda Ray originally was listed in critical condition at
Children's National Medical Center, but her condition was later
upgraded to serious.
   The child's mother, Mary Ray, 22, was led out of the apartment
complex smiling and talking to herself as neighbors jeered. As she
was placed in a police squad car, she turned toward television
cameras and said ``My, I feel good.'' She was to be arraigned in
D.C. Superior Court Saturday on charges of assault with intent to
kill, officials said.
   ``She has not indicated why'' she threw the infant out of the
window, Capt. William Ritchie, a spokesman of the district police
department said. ``But we believe that she has some very strong
religious beliefs. We are still in the process of investigating
that particular aspect.''
   A security guard at the apartment complex initially thought the
baby had been killed in the fall and put a coat over the body. The
little girl was rushed to the hospital after a neighbor lifted the
coat and the baby cried.

   News organizations that used unidentified sources
to erroneously link a sailor to the explosion that killed 47
crewmen on the USS Iowa will be challenged in court to identify
those sources, the sailor's attorney said Friday.
   ``We are going to name several media outlets as defendants for
the untrue and defamatory accusations that came out immediately
after the explosion,'' attorney Ellis Rubin told the Society of
Professional Journalists' annual convention.
   Rubin represents Kendall Truitt, who the attorney said was
identified in stories following the April gun turret explosion
aboard the battleship as a homosexual friend of one of the sailors,
Clayton Hartwig.
   Hartwig died in the blast. Last month, a Navy report citing
circumstantial evidence said Hartwig was the most likely person to
have caused the explosion.
   Stories on the Hartwig-Truitt link cited unidentified sources.
``We know who the sources are,'' Rubin said. ``The sources will
deny. It'll be an interesting exercise.''
   He said the news organizations, which he would not identify,
would refuse to name the sources or invoke First Amendment
protections.
   Rubin said defendants who don't reveal a source will have to pay
damages because under the law that means there is no source and
``they just made it up.''
   ``They're going to have a tough choice,'' he said.
   Truitt, who also appeared on the panel to discuss whether the
press went too far in covering the investigation of the Iowa
explosion, said Hartwig was a friend but denied any homosexual
relationship.
   ``I understand the public has a right to know and the press a
right to print,'' he said. ``But whatever happened to innocent
until proven guilty? Incredible. It's as if the press has immunity.
   ``Through leaks in the press, my life has been ruined forever.''
   Truitt said as recently as the past week, he has been written
about in newspapers as being dead.
   ``We all want to be fair,'' Rubin said. ``But there is supposed
to be a balance.''
   Jean Otto, a board member of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors and chairman of the group's Bar-Press Public Affairs
Committee, said a key question in developing such stories is
whether reporters can trust the government.
   ``I think that question can be answered very clearly,'' she
said. ``I think the government has a natural interest in lying.''
   Rubin contends Navy negligence, outmoded technology, unstable
gunpowder and an untrained crew were responsible for the explosion.
   ``From the point of view of the government employee who was
leaking the information, I believe the sources that leaked to the
media did it intentionally to take the focus away from the fact
that the battleship is an armored dinosaur and is no longer an
effective weapon of war,'' he said.
   Paul McMasters, deputy editorial page editor for USA Today and
national freedom of information chairman for the Society of
Professional Journalists, defended pursuit of stories by using
unidentified sources.
   ``Some things will never come to fruition if there isn't public
pressure to know the whole story,'' he said, adding that reporters
need to know the motive for government leaks.
   ``You have a responsiblity as a journalist to let the audience
know what side of the street your leak is on,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   As northern Californians added up
earthquake repair bills in the billions of dollars, Southern
Californians lined up to plop down $21 apiece to be shaken and
scared by a fake shake.
   The attraction: the Universal Studios Tours' simulated
earthquake, which officials had closed for two days after Tuesday's
deadly temblor devastated the San Francisco Bay area.
   When the attraction reopened Friday morning, thousands braved a
light, chilly rain to clamber aboard trams and see what they might
have missed.
   Or, in the case of northern Californian Ruth Hitchcock, to be
shaken again.
   ``It bounced me all over my driveway,'' she said of Tuesday's
quake that rattled her Livermore home. ``I've lived in that house
for 32 years and it's the strongest one I've ever felt.''
   But it wasn't enough to keep her from canceling a trip to
Southern California and a long-planned visit to the Universal
Studios Tour and its simulated earthquake ride.
   ``I came clear down here to see this,'' Ms. Hitchcock said
excitedly afterward. ``If they had canceled it, I would have been
very disappointed.''
   None of those interviewed Friday seemed bothered that the fake
quake is supposed to happen in San Francisco, or that they had just
witnessed a giant tanker truck hurled through the air as a roadway
fell in a staged scene similar to Tuesday's deadly collapse of
Oakland's Nimitz Freeway.
   Francis McClaskey, who went through Los Angeles' Sylmar quake in
1971, dismissed the irony with a wave of his hand.
   ``Nah, it's all in fun,'' said the retired trucker who now lives
in Boulder, Colo. ``This place is all make-believe. People can
separate reality from fantasy.''
   ``I thought it was great, especially when the (freeway) bridge
came down,'' said Jim Tolent, one of a group of teen-agers who
bounded from the tour tram talking excitedly about the ride. ``But
I do feel sorry for the people of San Francisco.''
   Curtis Marshall of Tracy said he was ``kind of sad'' he hadn't
been home in northern California for the real thing. He was at
Disneyland on Tuesday.
   Surin Hutawaniatana of Bangkok, Thailand, said he would have
missed the attraction if the real quake hadn't hit.
   ``We were going to San Francisco,'' he said of his tour group.
``But when they canceled that part of the trip we got to come here
instead.''
   He added he was thrilled with the ride.
   ``I had heard it's great, and it was,'' he said.
   Even so, tour operators were taking no chances at offending
anyone.
   While visitors were threatened by a robotic giant shark from the
movie ``Jaws,'' shot at by actors dressed as space aliens, and
buried in a make-believe avalanche, the comic patter of tour guides
ran apace.
   But it halted as the tram was about to enter a sound stage made
to look like a Bay Area Rapid Transit subway tunnel.
   ``For those of you who do not want to experience this, we
perfectly understand,'' a tour guide said solemnly over a
microphone as he gave any of the more than 200 tram riders an
opportunity to get off. One woman did.
   ``That is not a regular thing,'' Universal spokeswoman Joan
Bullard said of halting the tram before the fake quake. ``We are
doing it today and perhaps this weekend.''
   When the tram finally entered the set, several people braced
themselves.
   ``It's only make-believe,'' one woman cautioned her son.
   Several riders applauded when the quake was over, but some
veterans of real quakes expressed mild disappoint. They noted the
ride didn't last long enough or shake violently enough to match the
real thing.
   ``I liked the avalanche better because it really gave you the
feeling you were falling,'' Tolent said.

   From elementary school students who gave $60 in crayon money to
a foundation that donated $1 million, the world rallied to help San
Francisco Bay area residents dig out and get on with their lives.
   People gave blood, a home improvement store donated shovels,
trash cans and gloves, a cruise service sent passenger boats, a
bank bought tons of meat, and a trade group collected a truckload
of fruits and vegetables.
   ``Amazing is a pretty good word for all this,'' said Kim
Schwartz, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles chapter of the American
Red Cross. By Friday evening, the Red Cross alone had received at
least $8 million in pledges.
   A relief drive that started after Tuesday's quake with a brewery
filling beer cans with drinking water and radio stations asking
listeners for donations escalated through the week to a scale that
California charities called unprecedented for a U.S. disaster.
   One of the biggest donations came Friday from the Los
Angeles-based Ralph M. Parsons foundation, funded by the estate of
the late engineer, which gave $750,000 to the Red Cross and
$250,000 to the Salvation Army.
   ``This isn't something we do every day,'' said Executive
Director Christine Sisley. ``It was a desire to show the people of
northern California that the private sector and people in Southern
California care about their needs.''
   Japan's Sony Corp. and its subsidiary, Sony Corp. of America,
also offered $1 million, and the Ford Motor Co. said it was
donating $300,000 to the Red Cross and $200,000 to the Santa Clara
County United Way
   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank announced a $1 million
grant program to help communities rebuild. The bank also planned to
give a $250,000 grant to the Red Cross.
   Other donations measured up in heart, if not dollars.
   First- and second-graders at Tierra Vista School in Oxnard
decided that the $60 they raised in a recycling drive for crayons,
felt pens and chalk should go to the Red Cross for earthquake
relief.
   Two Bloomington, Ind., radio stations raised $40,120 in an
all-day pledge-a-thon. And a Tucson, Ariz, hairstylist announced
she would hold a cut-a-thon Sunday and donate the $5-a-head
proceeds. The Michigan Chiropractic Society offered its services,
too.
   But relief officials worried that the aid was insufficient to
fill all of the immediate needs of what could be the most expensive
natural disaster in U.S. history. One estimate put the damage total
at as high as $10 billion.
   ``We need cash, first and foremost. Because of who we are, we
can stretch your dollars,'' said Chris Garrett, spokeswoman for the
Red Cross chapter in San Francisco.
   People left homeless or displaced by the earthquake need things
that only money can buy, such as new glasses, prescription
medicines and false teeth.
   By Friday morning, 5,000 people were housed in 30 shelters in
the Bay area. An estimated 12,550 people were displaced in all,
according to the state Office of Emergency Services.
   Although aid came from around the world _ including offers of
help from the Soviet Union _ some of the most enthusiastic
responses came from Californians, especially quake-nervous Southern
Californians.
   Fullerton-based HomeClub Inc., a chain of home improvement
stores, donated about 200 shovels, 600 trash cans and 2,500 canvas
gloves to the Salvation Army.
   The parent company of Catalina Cruises sent four of its
700-passenger ships from Long Beach to the Bay area to ferry people
and supplies between Oakland and San Francisco.
   American Savings Bank purchased more than 1,200 pounds of meat
from the San Joaquin County Fair and had it transported from the
bank's Stockton headquarters to the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
   Food also was sent to the quake victims by the Fresh Produce
Council. The trade group's officials phoned around to Los Angeles
area wholesalers and were able to collect 4,500 pounds of fruits
and vegetables, enough to fill a tractor-trailer.
   ``The response was just phenomenal,'' said council Executive
Vice President Jan DeLyber. ``The wholesalers all rallied around
the cause. And in one hour we had the shipment.''

   A hunting dog was so excited after
retrieving a pheasant that it danced into a shotgun trigger, and
the blast injured the dog's master.
   Christian Dobberpuhl, who had to have shotgun pellets removed
from his foot, doesn't bear his pet any ill-will.
   ``The dog is a good dog,'' Dobberpuhl said Friday.
   Dobberpuhl and a friend, Frank Coch, bagged two birds during the
expedition near Mayville, northwest of Milwaukee on Wednesday.
After returning with the second bird, the dog triggered a 12-gauge
shotgun lying on the ground, Dobberpuhl said.
   The noise ``didn't bother the dog at all,'' said Dobberpuhl, 77.
   ``It's a funny thing, you know: `Dog attacks man.' But it was a
freak accident,'' Dobberpuhl said.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon nixed two joint performances by the
Soviet Red Army Band and Navy bands, but promoters say they don't
see the concerts causing a security breach and are fighting to
reverse the decision.
   The 200-member Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble, including the
40-piece band, is scheduled to perform Oct. 24 in the Seattle
Center Arena during its first tour of the United States.
   Easterday Promotions suggested that the 35-piece Sand Point Navy
Band appear in a free Seattle performance with the Red Army Band
the same day, said owner Kris Easterday.
   She also worked to arrange a joint appearance of the Soviet band
with the 35-piece Fairchild Air National Guard band in Spokane on
Oct. 26.
   Both Sand Point and Fairchild authorities were enthusiastic,
Easterday said, but Cmdr. James Britt at Sand Point said officials
had to submit the proposal to the Pentagon.
   On Wednesday, about two weeks after Easterday started promoting
the events, the Navy rejected the joint appearances.
   Britt said he didn't know why the Navy rejected the idea.
Easterday said a Pentagon official, Capt. Doug McUrrach, told her
the two countries had restrictions on the movement of military
personnel in each other's countries.
   The promoters were baffled.
   ``It's just an innocent half hour for the bands to get
together,'' said Easterday spokeswoman Kerry Coughlin. ``It seeme
really strange.''
   Easternday asked the office of Sen. Slade Gorton for help and
the Republican lawmaker's Seattle office started contacting Navy
officials on Friday.
   ``Slade is convinced that this is a good event to have and we're
seeking to have the decision reviewed at the least and at best
reversed,'' said Gorton aide Chuck Nordhoff. ``We're hoping that
message has gotten through but we don't know.''
   McUrrach could not be reached for comment Friday evening.

   Opera singer Enrico Caruso, asleep in the
Palace Hotel when the Great Earthquake struck in 1906, was so
unnerved by the shaker that he ran into the streets in his nightie
shouting, ``I'll never come back.''
   He caught a ferry to Oakland and never did return.
   But the artists, actors, musicians and performance managers who
experienced Tuesday's big quake vowed their shows would go on _
eventually, somewhere. Some of the promises couldn't be kept.
   ``The music or the arts, what they're about is the spirit of
life. ... It imparts something uniquely human; it kind of reminds
people that there a great richness to being alive,' ' said
singer-performer David Byrne of the Talking Heads, who is touring
to promote his new solo album ``Rei Mommo.''
   After watching television reports of the earthquake while
backstage in San Diego, Byrne canceled this week's shows at San
Francisco's Warfield.
   The concerts were rescheduled to Saturday night and moved to the
Greek Theater in Berkeley, but the likelihood of rain later forced
a cancellation there. Ticketholders were offered refunds.
   Elsewhere in the city, the cultural center of Northern
California, performers struggled through traffic jams and
cordoned-off sections of the city to attend rehearsals.
   All 106 members of the San Francisco Symphony made it to a 7
p.m. rehearsal Thursday, including 17 who battled enormous traffic
snarls on the east side of San Francisco Bay.
   ``We have a big responsibility to the community to energize,
give them the impetus to get on with their lives,'' said David
Neuman, a 31-year-old clarinetist with the symphony. ``The show in
general must go in, meaning life.''
   On the rock scene, George Clinton's weekend concerts were
postponed until December; Deborah Harry's Sunday concert was
indefinitely postponed; Oingo Boingo's concert Sunday in Santa Cruz
was canceled, and Stevie Nicks's concert Friday night was opened to
ticketholders from Tuesday's canceled performance.
   ``It doesn't seem quite right to produce an event in the middle
of a catastrophe, having people walk by buildings that have just
been condemned,'' said rock impresario Bill Graham, who canceled
nine concerts after the quake.
   Theatrical productions were disrupted, but most shows were to
resume early next week.
   Mayor Art Agnos encouraged San Francisco Bay area art
institutions to reschedule performances soon, but cautioned them
not ``rush to open before people are ready, otherwise it would e a
distraction rather than a relief.''
   The Friday and Saturday night premieres of the traveling musical
``Les Miserables'' were canceled after a water tank atop the Curran
Theater broke and drenched the stage.
   At the landmark Geary Theater, the American Conservatory
Theater's production of ``Right Mind,'' a multi-media presentation,
was ended after a giant light rack crashed onto the stage and large
plaster chunks fell from the ceiling. A recording for people
holding ACT tickets warned theater-goers: ``Be careful out there.''
   The troupe's upcoming production of a ``Tale of Two Cities'' may
be postponed, said John Sullivan, ACT managing director. Classes
for 200 students at ACT's prestigious drama school were postponed
through Monday.
   Stairwell damage to the Golden Gate Theatre forced cancellation
of the musical ``Durante'' through Tuesday.
   The San Francisco Opera's performance of Mozart's ``Idomeneo''
on Tuesday was canceled after windows and the glass front door blew
out of the War Memorial Opera House.
   The opera moved out of the baroque War Memorial Opera House
while structural engineers continued to check the building, whose
seats were littered with chunks of ceiling plaster.
   Performances were moved at least through the weekend to the
Masonic Auditorium, where only soloists would be in costume.
Productions there would have no scenery and a minimum of props.
   ``If the mundane things are not going on, at least the spiritual
things are continuing,'' said Lotfi Mansouri, general director of
the opera, which in its 57-year history had never had a change of
venue. ``We want to rally the people, and get them to look to
rebuilding. Our function is to prove to everybody that the spirt of
the city goes on.,''
   The opera and the symphony will give a free joint concert in
Golden Gate Park on Sunday, performing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
   ``It's a work that contains every emotion; despair, happiness,
tragedy, hope and joy,'' said Peter Pastreich, executive director
of the symphony. ``We think all of those feelings of a disaster are
there in this music.''
   Most of the art museums in San Francisco suffered only slight
damage to priceless collections, but at least 33 pieces at the
Asian Art Museum were damaged, for a loss estimated in the
millions, according to Clarence Shangraw.
   At the Oakland Art Museum, spokesman Phil Mumma said a
4-foot-tall jade figurine toppled in its case and was broken into
several hundred pieces. He did not have a loss estimate.
   ``A lot of the pieces, even if they have a dollar value, you
can't replace,'' he said. ``You may have the money, but you don't
have the object.''

<HEAD>Book: Political Contribution Questions Cost Glenn Spot on Dukakis
Ticket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. John Glenn lost his chance to be
Michael Dukakis' presidential running mate last year because he
gave unconvincing answers about his connection to a campaign
contributor in the savings and loan industry, says a new book.
   The book, ``All By Myself: The Unmaking of a Presidential
Campaign,'' says Dukakis was leaning toward the Ohio Democrat as
his vice presidential candidate until aides warned the
Massachusetts governor that Glenn's finances could be a political
liability.
   Thomas Oliphant, a Boston Globe reporter who wrote the book with
colleague Christine M. Black, said this week that the contributor,
who wasn't named in the book, was Charles H. Keating Jr., president
of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in Irvine, Calif.
   ``No one suggested that Senator Glenn had done anything illegal
or even ethically questionable, but the hard time he had answering
questions forcefully was potentially troublesome,'' The Dayton
Daily News quoted the book as saying in a story in Saturday's
editions.
   The newspaper said it obtained a copy of the book, which has not
been released.
   Federal investigators last month accused Keating of stealing
more than $1.1 billion from his savings and loan through illegal
loans and phony real-estate and tax transactions.
   Glenn and four other senators have come under criticism for
intervening with federal regulators two years ago during an
investigation of Keating. Keating has made donations to Glenn
totaling $234,000.
   Oliphant said, ``It had to do with a judgment as to which person
would stand up better in front of a battery of 500 microphones if
it ever came to that.''
   Glenn refused through an aide to comment on the book and a book
on the savings and loan scandal, ``The Big Fix,'' that recounts
Glenn's involvement on Keating's behalf.
   ``The senator hasn't read these books,'' Glenn press secretary
Rebecca Bell said. ``We just are not going to comment on excerpts
from a book.''
   Dukakis chose Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as his running mate
after campaign aides argued Glenn was a less reliable candidate
because of questions about his finances, the book says.
   At the time, news organizations were reporting Glenn as the
front-runner for the No. 2 spot, citing sources in the Dukakis
campaign.
   Glenn has acknowledged a long relationship with Keating, but
denied any wrongdoing. The senator said he met twice with federal
regulators in April 1987 at Keating's request after Keating
complained the investigation of his business was taking too long,
but backed off after learning the probe could lead to criminal
charges.
   Chairman Paul Brountas, the Dukakis campaign chairman who
conducted the final interviews with both Glenn and Bentsen,
disputed the book's assertion that Glenn's demeanor under
questioning threw the nomination to Bentsen.
   ``I disagree with the author and if he got it from a top aide, I
disagree with the top aide,'' Brountas said.
   But Brountas acknowledged the Dukakis campaign throughly
reviewed what he called ``the strengths and weaknesses of the
candidates, what they would add to the campaign, what kind of vice
presidents they would be.''

   A sheriff's deputy was killed and his
partner wounded Friday as they tried to arrest a man on a drug
charge, and the suspect held police at bay for nearly nine hours,
authorities said.
   Rudy Manzella, 30, whose home in this Buffalo suburb was
surrounded by more than 100 law enforcement officers, surrendered
at 10:20 p.m., ending a standoff that began at 1:30 p.m.
   Manzella was charged with first-degree murder, said Erie County
sheriff's Sgt. John Fox.
   Manzella, who was inside the house alone, had been talking by
telephone with police negotiators, but contact was broken off at 8
p.m., said county Undersheriff William Payne. As the standoff
continued, power to the neighborhood was shut off.
   The dead deputy was identified as William Dillemuth, 45, of
Depew. His partner, Deputy David Carlson, 34, of Angola, was in
serious condition with a gunshot wound at Millard Fillmore Suburban
Hospital, hospital officials said.
   Both officers were shot at while trying to arrest Manzella for
possession of marijuana in the city of Tonawanda, according to
Thomas Staebell, chief of patrol for the sheriff's department.
   Both deputies were apparently hit by gunfire outside the house,
Payne said. While Carlson was able to get away from the home,
Dillemuth fell on the driveway. Authorities say it was some time
before officers, fearful of being shot themselves, were able to
remove Dillemuth's body.
   Staebell said Manzella had faced drug charges in the past.

New River Gorge Bridge are up in the air while the National Park
Service considers whether to ban this year's Bridge Day leaps.
   Ranger Rick Brown said Thursday the New River would have to drop
6 feet for the jumps to go off as scheduled on Saturday in the 10th
annual event.
   Tim Velie, a board member of the Fayette County Chamber of
Commerce, said he still hopes the river will subside in time for
the jumps off the bridge, 876 feet above the river.
   But he said even if the jumping is canceled, Bridge Day events
such as an arts and crafts exhibit would be held.
   Bridge Day attracts divers worldwide and is the largest event of
the year for parachutists belonging to the U.S. BASE Association.
   State police will reroute the northbound lanes of U.S. 19 during
the event and allow pedestrians to walk on the highway.
   Bridge Day is the only time parachutists can legally jump from
the bridge. ``It's relatively safe,'' said Jean Boenish, executive
director of BASE _ which stands for people who jump off buildings,
antennas, spans and earth forms.
   ``Our volunteer staff is experienced BASE jumpers and they help
divers chose the right gear and show them the right techniques,''
said Boenish, who also coordinates the New River jumps.
   Three people have been killed in parachute leaps from the
bridge, two during the Bridge Day festivities. The last death was
in 1987.
   Some state officials talked of banning the event following the
accidents, but event organizers say Bridge Day provides the divers
with a safe outlet.
   The event began in 1980 with a handful of jumpers. Last year,
more than 100,000 people turned out to watch 300 divers perform 600
jumps from the center of the bridge.

   Early estimates that more than 250 people
were killed under the collapsed Nimitz Highway were proving to be
high, but no new estimates were offered, authorities said.
   Rescue workers found cars separated by as much as 60 feet,
rather than bumper-to-bumper as feared.
   Authorities had said more than 270 people were killed by
Tuesday's earthquake _ 250 of them during the Nimitz cave-in. That
was based on an estimate of how many vehicles would have been
crushed when the upper level of the freeway collapsed onto the
lower level and an estimate of one person per car.
   ``Now they are going lower, much lower in fact,'' Lisa
Covington, a spokeswoman for the state Office of Emergency
Services, said Thursday. ``What's happening is that they are
finding fewer vehicles under the bridge than they thought.''
   Reaching the vehicles has been painstakingly slow because of a
fear that huge sections of the interstate could collapse further on
rescue workers.
   ``We're not going to give any estimate,'' said Sgt. Donna Jay of
the Alameda County coronor's office.``I don't know how many people
are there. We're not going to know until they dig them out.''
   Coroners and other officials in the seven counties affected by
the quake said 35 bodies have been recovered.

<HEAD>Florida Supreme Court Outlaws Legal-Size Paper in Court Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court has decided
long briefs are on the way out for Florida attorneys and court
clerks.
   But the high court wasn't making a fashion statement Thursday.
   Beginning in January 1991, the state's court system will no
longer use legal-sized paper _ 8{ by 14 inches _ in any documents,
including lawsuits, pleadings, notices, opinions, judgments and
motions. The change mirrors rules in the federal courts and at
least 36 other states.
   The new rule actually takes effect in January 1990, but the
Supreme Court decided to allow a one-year grace period during which
the state's courts can accept either the legal size or standard
8{-by-11 paper.
   For years, a group called Eliminate Legal-Size Files _ or ELF _
has campaigned to get government to use the standard size.
   Walt Mullarkey, a retired certified records manager for the
state Division of Library Services, was chairman of ELF for five
years.
   ``It's just standardization. If everybody in the army fired a
different size weapon, they'd have a hell of a time fighting a
war,'' Mullarkey said.
   He said advantages to using just one size include having uniform
filing cabinets and savings from buying a single size in bulk
rather than two sizes.
   When the state Supreme Court first proposed the rule in April,
there was some understandable criticism, said Sid White, clerk of
the Supreme Court.
   ``It seems like most of the opposition came from people who were
selling legal-size paper and cabinets,'' White said.

<HEAD>Scotch, SPAM and Rice are Big Black-Market Sellers in South Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military personnel in South Korea buy six
times as much Chivas Regal scotch as the much larger U.S. force in
Europe _ but instead of drinking it, they're selling it on the
Korean black market, a study says.
   SPAM, Aqua Net hair spray and rice are among other favorites
selling in huge quantities at U.S. military commissaries in South
Korea, apparently bound for the black market, the General
Accounting Office said Thursday.
   Such sales far exceed what would normally be consumed by the
70,000 authorized buyers stationed there, and U.S. taxpayers are
footing part of the bill, GAO witnesses said at a Senate hearing.
The GAO is Congress' investigative arm.
   The Defense Department exports duty-free goods to bases in Korea
and other countries for sale at cut-rate prices in the commissaries
and exchanges.
   In 1988, commissaries in South Korea sold 1.1 million cans of
SPAM, or almost 12 pounds per person per year; 34 pounds or 816
American cheese slices for every man, woman and child, and 170
pounds of rice for every consumer.
   ``If one person consumed 170 pounds of rice a year, that would
be a little over 14 pounds of rice a month or just under a half a
pound of rice a day,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of
the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on government
oversight and management.
   ``There would be little room in a person's diet for anything
else but rice,'' he said.
   Black marketeers recruit U.S. service members or their
dependents to buy the products for later resale or enlist the help
of cashiers and sales clerks, mostly Koreans.
   The investigators concluded that most of the Chivas Regal scotch
purchased for sale, including the 12-year-old bottle and
21-year-old bottle, ends up in the black market. In 1988, service
members in Korea bought 314,748 liters of the scotch.
   ``Fewer military members in Korea _ 15 percent of the total in
Europe _ purchased more than six times the number of Chivas Regal
bottles purchased in Europe,'' the investigators said.
   In addition, the meat merchant who services the Osan Air Base
told investigators that 70,000 pounds of oxtails are supplied per
month to the commissary.
   Donna Heivilin, director of logistics issues for the GAO, said
Korean tariffs make the price of legally imported U.S. goods very
expensive.
   Heivilin told the subcommittee the cost of serving the black
market was about $7 million a year, assuming that 20 percent of the
$250.4 million worth of items sold in Korea in 1988 ended up in the
cupboards of unauthorized individuals.
   ``This is totally abhorrent, totally unacceptable,'' said Levin,
who has called for a reduction of U.S. forces in Korea.
   Sandra Kristoff, an assistant U.S. trade representative for Asia
and the Pacific, acknowledged that Korea's restrictive import
practices have fueled the black market.
   But she stressed that the Korean black market has been in
existence for some time, and the United States is taking steps to
reduce the illegal sales.
   ``In July of 1988 our cigarette agreement with Korea went into
effect, permitting the importation of cigarettes without
restraint,'' she said. ``Black market activity in this product has
dropped off significantly since then.''
   To solve the problem, Levin has suggested elimination of the
ration control system in which service members with no dependents
are limited to $500 per month and those with dependents $800 per
month.
   Another option is convincing South Korea ``to open its doors to
these high-demand consumer goods,'' he said.

<HEAD>Colombian Drug Trafficker's Sentence Overturned on Nationality Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court overturned the
12-year prison sentence of a Colombian drug trafficker on grounds
that a lower-court judge wrongly considered the man's nationality
in determining punishment.
   The three-member appeals panel on Thursday returned the case of
Mauricio Borrero-Isaza to U.S. District Judge William D. Keller for
resentencing.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a sentence may
not be based even partly on a defendant's nationality, noting that
Keller penalized Borrero more harshly than a non-Colombian
co-defendant.
   Borrero was convicted of conspiracy and possession with intent
to distribute cocaine after he was arrested in 1986 with more than
two pounds of the drug in his car.
   During sentencing, Keller repeatedly told the defense attorney
that he wanted to show people in cocaine-exporting countries that
they would be harshly punished if they shipped drugs to the United
States.
   ``Somehow the people who are selling narcotics, particularly
from source countries, have to know that we in the United States
mean business, and we are going to put a stop to this,'' Keller
said at the time. ``I want people in Colombia to know it is not
going to be tolerated.''
   The appeals court said that while it is appropriate to consider
``the fact that a criminal has trafficked in drugs originating from
a source country like Colombia,'' a defendant's nationality is
irrelevant.
   Thomas Lind, a co-defendant who pleaded guilty in the case,
received a seven-year sentence from Keller.

   Senate concern about freedom of speech and a
cooling of the summer's political passions combined to defeat the
proposed constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, lawmakers
say.
   ``I don't know that public interest has faded; I think that
public interest has changed,'' Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said
Thursday after the proposed amendment failed in the Senate.
   Opponents of the measure said Americans are having second
thoughts about the notion of changing the Constitution.
   White House lobbying appeared minimal despite a strong public
campaign that last summer took President Bush to the foot of the
Iwo Jima Memorial.
   The measure did win a bare majority in the Senate, 51-48, but
fell 15 votes short of the required two-thirds of senators present
and voting.
   Eleven Republicans joined 37 Democrats to oppose the measure.
Thirty-three Republicans and 18 Democrats voted for the proposal,
which would have authorized the state and federal governments to
outlaw flag desecration.
   Following the vote, White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said Bush
was ``disappointed'' and believes such an amendment represents
``the only ... real protection for the flag.'' She said a bill sent
to the president last week to ban flag-burning by statute ``would
not survive constitutional scrutiny.''
   Critics of the amendment, in contrast, said the bill would
satisfy concern in the country about flag-burning.
   ``I think when the statute passed, it made it much easier to
focus on the Constitution,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
``But this amendment should fall anyway because of the danger it
poses to the Bill of Rights.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a strong supporter of the
amendment, told reporters that ``the public was confused on this.''
   ``They were led to believe a statute would do the job and
produce results,'' he said. ``Now we don't know what we've got if
anything.''
   Supporters of the amendment claimed it was the only sure way to
prevent a recurrence of the Supreme Court decision in June that
overturned the conviction of Texas flag-burner Gregory Lee Johnson
on grounds his right to free speech was violated.
   ``We all lose with this action,'' said Miles Eplin, national
commander of the American Legion, after the vote. ``Today, I feel
like my friends have been let down, as well as those from other
generations who died believing that our nation would always
remember their sacrifices and respect the foremost symbol of all
they held dear.''
   Critics said there would be a political price to pay at election
time for opposing the measure. At the same time, though, they
seemed increasingly emboldened to attack the amendment as a threat
to the Constitution.
   ``We face no sudden or uncontrollable burst of flag
destruction,'' Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,
declared. ``...Yet we are being asked to believe that the flag
which neither Hitler nor Stalin could defeat is now threatened by a
single misguided person who most Americans never heard of and don't
care about.''
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., took the Senate floor on
Thursday morning to make one last appeal for approval of the
measure. He painted a colorful panorama of flag history from Iwo
Jima to the lunar landing and said the Senate was too bogged down
in technicalities.
   ``The need for this amendment will not be found in a textbook or
a treatise on constitutional law,'' Dole said. ``No, it will be
found in the emotions of the heart, emotions deeply rooted in the
real-life experiences of millions of Americans, and emotions that
are crying out today to give the flag real and lasting protection.''
   Afterward, Dole said: ``I think the flag should be flown at
half-staff after this vote.''
   Danforth and Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., initially co-sponsored
the proposal, but both did an about-face on Tuesday and became
opponents.
   ``When I was originally asked to support it, I thought, I want
to protect the flag,'' Danforth said. ``... But as the vote got
closer and as I started reflecting on it and getting more serious
about it, my opinion became one of the greatest reluctance to
change the Constitution.''

   Arista Records plans to record Whitney Houston
and other big-name artists at a new recording studio that company
officials hope will make Atlanta ``the Motown of the South.''
   The studio will be part of a new label, LaFace, and will be run
by Antonio Reid and Kenny Edmonds, Arista President Clive Davis
said Thursday.
   The pair, who have written or produced songs for artists such as
Paula Abdul, Bobby Brown and Sheena Easton, recently moved to
Atlanta from Los Angeles, Davis said.
   In a memo to Arista employees in New York this week, Davis said
Reid and Edmonds ``will produce a limited number of outside
projects _ including, at my specific request, Whitney Houston.''
   Ms. Houston's first two LPs, ``Whitney Houston'' and
``Whitney,'' have total sales of about $15 million.
   ``Atlanta is an easy place to come to, and this is a
consideration when you're working with artists from all over the
country and the world,'' Davis said.
   Arista, owned by BMG Music, has reported gross sales of $120
million so far this year. BMG also owns RCA Records and the Jive
recording label.

   Former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill
says the Democrats in Congress who surrendered their ideals to
Ronald Reagan's popularity are the same ones who pushed for a
get-tough policy in Panama.
   O'Neill said Democratic ideals have suffered this decade,
adding: ``I had so many Democrats run away from me, their promises

popularity.''
   He said he disagreed with those same Democrats who are

coup attempt against the Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``I just think that Noriega is going to fall on himself. I'm
glad we didn't send any troops in there,'' O'Neill said.

   It has been a good season for area outfitters, Norrick said.
   ``The weather has been good, but we need a little rain,''
Norrick said. ``I hate to see someone like Mr. Carter rained on,

<TEXT>
   Earthquake-damaged homes collapsed
under the prodding of powerful aftershocks Thursday, renewing fears
among hundreds of residents already too horrified to go indoors.
   ``The whole neighborhood went outside. It's too scary inside
when these things hit,'' resident Lucy Hernandez said hours after
the series of aftershocks struck this quiet agricultural community
70 miles south of San Francisco.
   More than 150 homes in the narrow coastal valley will likely be
condemned, many of those dealt the ultimate blow during the
aftershocks to Tuesday's destructive 6.9-magnitude temblor, said
City Clerk Lorraine Washington.
   Preliminary estimates place damage at nearly $100 million _ some
$24 million to homes and up to $75 million to industrial and
commercial buildings.
   Watsonville is about 20 miles south of the epicenter of the
quake.
   ``Some stores on Main Street probably have to be demolished,''
Washington said. The older brick and unreinforced concrete
structures took the brunt of the latest shaking.
   The quakes were too much for the historical St. Patrick's
Catholic Church, which withstood the 1906 quake. With its
underpinnings crumbling, demolition is considered a certainty.
   The violent rumbles sent chills through the 30,000 residents in
the predominantly Hispanic community, part of California's
so-called ``salad bowl'' region, where much of the nation's
lettuce, asparagus and artichokes are grown.
   Twenty miles northwest of Watsonville, in the seaside city of
Santa Cruz, authorities said as many as 10,000 people were believed
to be homeless Thursday night.
   Also Thursday, Santa Cruz County officials closed all beaches in
the city because of a sewage spill, and a strong aftershock that
struck in the late afternoon caused more damage to a major highway
already closed after Tuesday's temblor.
   Earlier in the day, a rescue team pulled the body of 23-year-old
Robin Ortiz from under two tons of rubble that rained down on her
when a downtown Santa Cruz coffee store collapsed during Tuesday's
deadly earthquake.
   The discovery brought a tragic end to an emotional conflict
between searchers and the woman's friends, who had insisted that
Ms. Ortiz might be alive and criticized rescue efforts as too slow.
   Police said at least five people were arrested Wednesday night
when they broke through a barricade at the site of the Santa Cruz
Coffee Roasting Co. after being told that the search was being
halted at dark.
   In Watsonville, Washington said 400 to 500 residents sought
refuge in shelters and another 500 were camping outside on lawns,
in back yards, parks and empty fields.
   ``These people don't want to go back home and don't want to go
to the shelters. They feel safer outdoors than in a building,''
Washington said.
   Marcelina Toussaint, a 73-year-old woman wearing purple gloves
and a felt beret, said she slept uneasily in a chair next to her
front door and made frequent dashes outside whenever the earth
moved.
   ``I can't stop shaking,'' Mrs. Toussaint said. ``I guess I'm
surviving, but I'm scared.''
   Many residents who emptied out of their broken homes spread
across lawns and vacant lots like refugees.
   ``We're talking about people with no resources, no money for
food and no money for health care,'' said Barbara Garcia, executive
director of Salud Pera La Gente, a state-funded community clinic.
   ``I think the big thing now is that the aftershocks are really
scaring people,'' Ms. Garcia said.
   Hundreds of people spent the night at local Red Cross shelters
and churches and more than 100 camped in a vacant downtown lot
designated as the future site of the Watsonville Post Office.
   ``We have no place to live. The building cracked,'' said Raoul
Perez, 36, who works in the lettuce fields.
   Thirty children romped on a pile of clothing nearby as Perez
added, ``It's hard, especially for the kids, because we have no
gas, water, special things for kids.''
   At a shelter set up at a National Guard armory near the airport,
scores of families sat on steel folding chairs and cots with
blankets and clothing strewn everywhere.
   Earthquake victims also found food and shelter at St. Patrick's.
Even though the red brick church was shattered by the quake, the
Rev. Mike Miller voiced optimism during his Thursday sermon.
   He reminded his congregation gathered in another church
building, ``The foundation of the church is Christ, and that's an
unshakeable rock. ... We've just lost a house (the church). We'll
have to build a new house.''
   Miller, who also conducted prayer services at local shelters,
said he found quake victims ``at peace and glad to have each
other.''
   ``I guess what I'll remember most about the shelters were the
people clinging to each other _ they were clinging to the right
things,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Today sensitive instruments detect every tiny
movement of the earth's crust, recording in detail disastrous
earthquakes like the one in Northern California on Tuesday.
   These geological tools represent the ultimate refinement in a
line that began almost 2,000 years ago with the ancient dragon bowl
that dropped a ball when shaken.
   The first earthquake recording device was credited to the
Chinese philosopher Chang Heng in the year 132.
   He developed a bowl with dragon-shaped heads located at eight
points around the outside. Each had a small ball balanced in its
mouth; during an earthquake the ball dropped out, landing in the
mouth of a toad statue located below.
   The location of a quake was supposed to determine which dragon
dropped its ball, and the instrument was said to have recorded a
quake 400 miles away that could not be felt by people near the bowl.
   J. de la Haute Feuille developed a similar device to record
quakes in the year 1703, filling his bowl to the brim with mercury.
In a quake, some mercury would spill on the side toward the quake.
   Dave Russ, assistant chief geologist at the U.S. Geological
Survey, said that in modern measuring devices, instruments near the
center of an earthquake are knocked off their recording scale in a
violent temblor, but readings can be calculated from the waves
reaching more distant machines.
   Agency scientists at Menlo Park, Calif., near the site of
Tuesday's deadly quake, are now collecting all available
information on what happened.
   The basic tool today is a seismograph, an instrument developed
in the late 19th century.
   Basically, it is a box with a frame attached to the ground that
includes a suspended weight, which is able to swing. When an
earthquake causes the frame to move, inertia forces the mass to lag
behind and its swing is recorded by a pen and ink sweeping back and
forth over paper. That pen trace is the commonly shown seismogram.
   These machines can be set for vertical or horizontal shaking and
in modern machines the shaking produces an electrical signal which
is amplified to drive a pen, allowing them to be much more
sensitive than in the past.
   Over the years scientists have learned that earthquakes produce
more than one type of wave, and that the different kinds move
through the earth's crust at different speeds.
   By comparing the time of arrival of the different wave forms at
a seismograph, scientists can determine how far away a quake
occurred. Comparing the results at several locations allows them to
calculate the exact position of the quake.
   While these are still the primary instruments used to measure
quakes, geologists also have developed an array of other machines.
   For example, Russ pointed out that in parts of California along
the San Andreas fault, laser beams are used to measure land
movement.
   The laser is placed on a hill and shines on a target located on
the other side of a fault. Regular flashes of light allow the
scientist to compare the time it takes for the light to travel
between the two spots and thus calculate whether the light and
target are moving relative to one another.
   Other instruments buried in the earth can sense the stresses
placed on rocks. Measurements are also made of radon and other
gases released by the earth and sensitive meters can even trace
changes in the strength of gravity beneath the spots where they are
located.
   A pendulum was first used to record a quake in Naples in 1731,
with Nichomas Cirillo reporting that the amplitude of the swing
decreased with distance from the quakes.
   Using a magnifier trained at the image of a cross hair, focused
on a bowl of mercury, Robert Mallet was able to measure the speed
of waves in the earth following dynamite explosions in England in
1851.
   Luigi Palmieri installed a seismograph at Mount Vesuvius in
1856, but the instruments were brought into general use toward the
end of that century by a group of British geologists headed by John
Milne, working in Japan.
   Milne eventually managed to get seismograph stations set up
around the world, collecting data at a central observatory for
analysis.

<HEAD>Senate Vote Puts Abortion Matter in Sight of Bush Veto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stage is set for a presidential veto of a
bill allowing government-paid abortions for poor women who are
victims of rape or incest.
   The Senate put the matter in President Bush's hands Thursday
when it gave final congressional approval to a spending bill
including the new provisions for Medicaid abortions.
   The 67-31 vote drew little debate after the House's surprise
vote last week to approve the broader provisions. The Senate passed
the measure before, but final agreement on a compromise spending
bill was needed to send the bill to the president.
   The measure would allow federal money to be spent on abortions
for poor women who are victims of rape or incest and who ``reported
promptly'' to law enforcement or public health authorities.
Medicaid restrictions in the law since 1981 permit federal money
for abortions only in cases where the life of the mother is
endangered by her pregnancy.
   ``The president has told us he will veto this bill because he
won't accept language that allows poor rape and incest victims
access to abortions,'' said Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash.
   ``I'm sorry the president of the United States, the most
powerful man in the world, has chosen to veto this bill ... and
thereby cause enormous additional suffering for some of the world's
most unfortunate and powerless victims,'' he said.
   Rep. Bill Green of New York, a Republican moderate, said 30
House Republicans have sent Bush a letter urging him to sign the
bill. Green said Bush's opposition to the measure puts ``him and us
in a really indefensible position.''
   ``I would strongly urge the president to recognize that poor
women have the right to make that same moral choice ... as rich
women do,'' Green said.
   The abortion provision is part of a $156.7 billion measure to
finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which
began Oct. 1.
   Bush had said last week he was looking for ``room for
flexibility'' and did not wish ``conflict'' on abortion _ an issue
that has been troublesome for him throughout his political career.
But this week he hardened his stand and promised the veto, saying
government financing of the abortions ``would compound a violent
act with the taking of an unborn life.''
   Bush says he supports permitting abortions in cases of rape,
incest or danger to the life of the mother but opposes having the
federal government pay for the abortions in cases of rape or incest.

   The Interior Ministry says it will
return all samizdat materials and printing machines that police
seized from independent writers and publishers between 1983 and
1988.
   The ministry did not say how much equipment or samizdat had been
confiscated. It said, however, that just one copy of each
confiscated samizdat work remained in the archives as the rest had
been destroyed.
   Many of Hungary's long-time leading dissidents are members of
opposition groups that have in the past 18 months gained full legal
and political recognition as the country transforms itself into a
Western-style democracy.
   One of the best known underground or samizdat journals,
Beszeloe, is now legally sold on Hungarian newsstands and published
regularly.
   The announcement was made Thursday in a communique carried by
the official MTI news agency.

   The Bush administration doesn't share the
enthusiasm of U.S. businesses eager to jump in for profit and
excitement as Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev seeks to reform a
Marxist system lagging in productivity and consumer goods.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, speaking this week to the
private Foreign Policy Association in New York, again stressed the
view that lasting economic change must come from within; it cannot
and should not be provided by the West.
   Consumer shortages are unlikely to be relieved nor productivity
increased without a stable currency, free and competitive markets,
private property and real prices, Baker said. ``The very logic of
perestroika requires that the Soviets themselves must solve their
own problems in a comprehensive, organic way,'' he said.
   But American businesses are charging in nonetheless. Fifty new
posts are being added to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to assist them
in grappling with Soviet bureaucracy and a legal system that is in
such flux that entrepreneurs are having a rough time seizing
capitalistic opportunities.
   Gorbachev may be changing the way Soviet bureaucrats and
ordinary citizens think about the marketplace, but historically
people who have lived all their lives under Marxism are not
risk-takers.
   The Soviets also do not have the cash to pay for American-built
enterprises, nor the goods to barter for them _ with the exception
of such items as oil, gold, diamonds and furs that the Soviets
prefer to sell for themselves on world markets.
   And yet about 4,000 American companies are trying to do business
in the Soviet Union, compared to less than 100 before Gorbachev
assumed power in 1985. A thousand joint ventures have been signed
and registered, but only a dozen or so deals have been struck. The
most picturesque: McDonald's and Pizza Hut soon will be selling
fast food to Russians.
   The foreign investment is relatively small, averaging about $1
million a venture.
   Still, American businessmen look at the Soviet Union as the last
great untapped market, said Richard N. Dean, the Coudert Brothers
lawyer who last year opened the first Moscow office for an American
law firm. Dean said Thursday that under Gorbachev the Soviets have
bent over backwards to liberalize their joint venture laws.
   But he described other laws that govern American investors as
``very uncertain territory.'' Often, he said, Soviet laws are not
available to the public. ``Either they are state secrets or nobody
can find them,'' Dean said at a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade
relations.
   Getting approval for projects also is a huge problem for
Westerners. ``This is a business culture that is sort of fused with
a political culture,'' Dean said.
   Moreover, the general atmosphere in the Soviet Union is hazy.
Soviet law is in the midst of a major overhaul. The right to
strike, ownership of property, freedom of assembly and speech are
among the fundamental issues being debated in the Supreme Soviet.
This carries a risk for American businesses, which prefer stability
and certainty.
   And yet, there is a trend under Gorbachev to promote domestic
benefits for the Soviet people. The City Council in Moscow is
prepared to give up a hotel site if the foreign partner is willing
to arrange financing to rebuild a factory outside the capital, Dean
said.
   ``This is a good thing, and it offers some opportunities,'' said
the American lawyer. ``It gets at an awful problem that they have.
The deterioration in the standard of living of the Soviet people is
becoming a greater and greater concern.''

   Opponents of cuts in education funds said a huge
Statehouse demonstration showed the strength of their cause, and
students volunteered to replace mums that were trampled when the
rally turned unruly.
   About 15,000 state college and university students gathered at
the Capitol Wednesday, but organizers lost control of the protest.
Four people were arrested and two injured in the melee.
   ``The fact that so many people came out was extraordinary and
sent a very clear message that they care about the quality of their
education,'' Paul Tsongas, chairman of the Board of Regents in
Higher Education, said Thursday. ``But, like I remember during my
youth, the excesses of a handful always get more attention than
what I believe was the remarkably good (behavior) of the vast, vast
majority.''
   Horticulture students from the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst volunteered Thursday to plant chrysanthemums to replace the
ones trampled by students in front of the Capitol, said state Rep.
Stanley Rosenberg.
   Doors and windows inside the building were broken and a
drainpipe was knocked down by students who climbed to the roof. The
maintenance office said the front lawn would need to be reseeded.
   Rep. Jacqueline Lewis was caught in the crunch of students and
shaken up as she tried to enter the chamber to answer a roll-call
vote. But she said she wouldn't hold the ``ill-behaved and
outrageous'' minority against the students' cause.
   The higher education budget, already strapped by earlier cuts,
is set to be stripped of $25 million more during the next round of
budget reductions. The protesters were calling for the programmed
cuts to be restored.

<HEAD>Test-Site Minister: `The Only Priest I Know Who Fires Nuclear Weapons'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many priests are called upon at the hour of
death, but the Rev. Bob Nelson may be the only priest with his
finger on the button of the bombs that could one day obliterate
mankind.
   As a nuclear test controller at the Nevada Test Site, his job is
to safely detonate the most powerful and horrifying weapons. As an
ordained Episcopal priest, he prays those weapons will never be
used.
   Actually, Nelson says, it isn't buttons that set off the bombs.
   ``It's all done by computers now,'' he explained in a recent
interview.
   But with priests generally among the protesters at the
underground test site where he works, Nelson says he is forced
daily to reconcile the differences between his occupation and his
calling.
   He admits to being ``the only priest I know who fires nuclear
weapons.'' Nelson, a 48-year-old father of two children, became a
priest two years ago and, as he explains it, almost against his
will.
   ``With my family, work and other commitments, I thought becoming
a priest was something that just couldn't happen,'' Nelson said.
   But he finally heeded a bishop's advice that a true calling
would not go away.
   ``The way God works, he just doesn't follow the rules at all,''
he said.
   As deputy manager of Nevada operations for the Energy Department
and one of three rotating controllers at the test site, he has
given the final authority for the detonation of more than 30
underground nuclear tests in the 1980s.
   Nelson often is asked to go before anti-nuclear groups and
explain the government's position that nuclear testing is vital to
the nation's security.
   ``I don't think in any of these discussions I change anybody's
mind or they change mine, but we come away from honest and direct
discussions the better for it,'' he said. ``The best comment I ever
got from one anti-nuclear activist was `I don't agree with what
you're doing, but I'm glad you're the one doing it.'''
   He added that he would like to be in a situation where there are
no nuclear weapons. ``But I would also like a situation where we
maintain the system of freedom and justice we have in our
country,'' he said.
   Nelson, a lifelong Episcopalian, was nominated into the
priesthood by the congregation at All Saints Episcopal Church under
a church canon that allows the elevation of parishioners to priests
in remote parishes.
   ``Bob is just an exceptional priest and a very humble person,''
said the Rev. Stewart C. Zabriskie, the church's Nevada bishop. ``I
wish I had more like him.''
   Nick Aquilina, Nelson's boss and the manager of the sprawling
nuclear testing facility northwest of Las Vegas, said Nelson's
honesty had gained him the respect of co-workers as well as that of
protesters on the other side of the fence.
   ``He's the kind of guy I admire and respect whether he worked
for me or was on the other side,'' Aquilina said. ``I believe he
comes across in a very credible way because he's so honest. I've
never second-guessed his motives on anything.''
   Zabriskie, who said the Episcopal Church has taken no firm stand
on nuclear testing, views Nelson as a ``bridge builder'' who is
able to communicate with both sides on an emotional issue.
   ``I think he's a peacemaker; I really do,'' Zabriskie said. ``He
takes a lot of risks and is very vulnerable when he stands up
before the hostility of some people.''
   Nelson does not criticize anti-nuclear protesters who often
congregate at the gates of the test site. Many are his friends,
including the wife of another Episcopal priest in Las Vegas.
   Nelson and the priest's wife are founding board members and work
closely together on a project to build a shelter for homeless women
and children.
   ``We just don't talk about nuclear weapons when we're working
together,'' Nelson said. ``She and I have the same ultimate aim.
We'd both like not to have nuclear weapons. The difference is how
we get there.''

<HEAD>Plains States Lag Behind in Income Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The states in the center of the country are
falling behind the rest of the nation in the rate of nonfarm
personal income growth, the government says.
   ``In the Plains region, nonfarm income grew 6.9 percent ... 1.5
percentage points below the U.S. average,'' the Commerce Department
reported Thursday. ``Durable manufacturing payrolls grew slower
than in any other region.
   ``Construction and nondurable manufacturing also were weak,''
according to the report by the department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis. ``In each Plains state _ North Dakota, South Dakota,
Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Minnesota _ nonfarm income
grew slower than the U.S. average.''
   States in the interior regions generally continued to lag behind
both coasts in income growth. The interior regions averaged a 7.5
percent rate, while the coastal regions averaged 8.9 percent.
   Besides the Plains, the growth rate in other interior regions
was 7.5 percent in the Rocky Mountain states; 7.7 percent in the
Southwest, and 7.9 percent in the Great Lakes.
   The average growth for the country was 8.4 percent, the
department said. The inflation rate for the 12 months ending in
June was 5.2 percent.
   The Far West led the coastal growth, up 9.6 percent, bolstered
by strength in construction and manufacturing, particularly
aircraft production.
   The Boeing Co. is headquartered in Washington state and the
Douglas Aircraft Division of McDonnell Douglas Corp. is in
California.
   The Far West also includes Oregon and the national income growth
leader, Nevada.
   In each of the other coastal regions, however, growth was only
somewhat above the national average _ up 8.7 percent in the
Southeast, 8.6 percent in New England and 8.5 in the Mid-Atlantic.
   Nevada, with its tourism and mining industries, continued to
lead the country in income growth, up 12.8 percent. Wyoming ranked
last with a 3.6 percent growth rate.
   Following Nevada in income growth were: Delaware, 10.9 percent;
Florida, 10.5 percent; Maine, 10.4 percent; Hawaii, 10.3 percent;
South Carolina, 10.1 percent; Vermont, 10 percent; Washington, 9.9
percent; Virginia, 9.7 percent; and North Carolina, 9.6 percent.
   Ranked with Wyoming at the bottom of the list were: North
Dakota, up 4.3 percent; Louisiana, 5.9 percent; South Dakota, 6
percent; Montana, 6.3 percent; Iowa, 6.4 percent; Oklahoma, 6.4
percent; Nebraska, 6.6 percent; Kansas, 6.7 percent, and New
Mexico, 6.8 percent.
   The Commerce Department focuses on changes in nonfarm income as
a better indication of a region's prosperity because of the often
erratic nature of farm income.

<HEAD>Michigan Begins Paying Private Insurance for Some AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA ZAGAROLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Needy AIDS sufferers too ill to continue
working are finding a reprieve in a Michigan program that offers to
pay their private insurance premiums in order to save the state
millions of Medicaid dollars.
   The program is a model for similar programs being developed in
other states, including Colorado, Wisconsin, New York and
California, said state Rep. David Hollister, who developed the idea.
   Nine men with acquired immune deficiency syndrome have qualified
for the two-year pilot program, which was implemented Oct. 1 in the
metropolitan Detroit counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb, where
the bulk of the state's AIDS patients live.
   Assistance is offered to AIDS patients who had a job but were
forced to stop working because of illness. Federal regulations
allow people who lose their jobs to keep their insurance for up to
18 months at their own expense, but many cannot afford it.
   Instead of waiting for the patient's inevitable fall to Medicaid
status, the state can intervene at that point and pay the private
insurance premium, saving more than $1,000 per month per person,
officials said.
   The cost of treating an AIDS patient in Michigan is about $1,600
a month. The average payment for the nine people who have qualified
is $245 a month, said program coordinator Denise Johnson.
   The program could save Michigan $4 million by 1991, said
Hollister of Lansing.
   And it's helping AIDS patients who would hover near the poverty
level, said Wellness Networks Inc. Executive Director Barbara
Murray, whose organization operates Michigan's AIDS-information hot
line.
   ``Financially, AIDS is a very devastating disease that can just
wipe people out, just the medication costs alone,'' she said.
   To qualify for the program, a person must have an income less
than $1,000 per month, and cash assets of less than $10,000. A
physician must certify that the person's medical condition makes it
unlikely he can continue working.
   The insurance industry has been cooperative, and in three cases
companies bent the rules and allowed the state to resume payment of
a policy that had been cut off, said Hollister.
   Michigan plans to promote its program through radio commercials
and advertisements in underground newspapers and gay magazines, as
well as through hospitals and AIDS advocacy groups, said Johnson.
   As of Oct. 1, 1,337 cases of AIDS had been reported in Michigan
since 1981, 791 of whom died. During the same period nationally,
109,167 cases were reported and 63,836 died.

<HEAD>House Votes to Double Aid Package to Warsaw Pact Reformers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is turning up the political heat on
President Bush with its overwhelming approval of $837 million in
aid to Poland and Hungary over the next three years, nearly double
what the White House asked.
   ``The administration has failed to grasp that this is a critical
turning point in the history of East-West relations,'' said Rep.
David Bonior, D-Mich., a member of the Democratic leadership.
   The aid, approved Thursday on a 345-47 vote, is an effort to
shore up fledgling reform movements in the two Soviet Bloc
countries and seize political advantage on the issue from Bush,
whose response has been branded ``timid'' by congressional
Democrats.
   House Republicans joined the march in droves. ``The winds of
freedom and democracy are sweeping across Eastern Europe and are
tearing holes in the Iron Curtain,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill.,
adding the aid package was essential to sustain the reforms.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, called it ``an extraordinarily cheap way
of helping redirect the course of history.''
   Bush initially proposed $149 million for the two countries when
he visited Eastern Europe in July, but since then has raised the
amount to $450 million under pressure from Capitol Hill.
   But the measure that passed the House Thursday clearly has made
the administration uncomfortable. It wants to retain leverage to
make sure economic reforms go forward, but doesn't want to be seen
as reluctant to reward those who are breaking the grip of communism.
   In a statement, the White House said it would generally support
the bill but ``has reservations about the excessive funding
levels'' and would work to decrease the amount when the bill goes
to the Senate.
   Included in the package were a $200 million grant to help
stabilize Poland's economy; $160 million for Poland and $40 million
for Hungary to promote private enterprise; $200 million in
short-term guarantees and insurance for U.S. exporters selling
products to the two countries; and up to $125 million in food aid
for Poland.
   The debate over food aid took up much of the debate time, with
House members arguing over whether to trim an estimated $37 million
subsidy in the bill for U.S. maritime interests. The House voted
228-170 not to cut the requirement that 75 percent of the food be
shipped on more expensive U.S. vessels.
   Other money would provide technical training in business skills,
environmental improvements, aid to democratic institutions,
cultural exchanges, scientific projects and medical aid.
   In their first open voting in 40 years, Poles last June handed
control of the government to leaders of the Solidarity trade union.
A week ago the new government outlined plans for sweeping economic
reforms.
   Hungary this year became the first Warsaw Pact nation to
physically dismantle the barriers at its borders and allow East
Germans to flee to the West. It is developing a new multi-party
political system under a liberalized constitution and plans
parliamentary elections early next year.
   But economic problems in both countries threaten the reforms.
   The Polish government faces particularly crucial tests, with
inflation running at an annual rate of 200 percent and climbing,
food shortages, and a $39 billion foreign debt burden.
   Supporters of the aid package said it will help relieve economic
pressures and buy time for the new leaders to institutionalize
their reforms, while encouraging changes in the rest of Eastern
Europe.
   Citizens in Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia are watching
what is happening in Poland and Hungary, said Rep. Stephen Solarz,
D-N.Y. ``If these experiments fail, it will stifle the prospects
for political and economic reform in the other countries,'' he said.

   Environmentalists who failed to stop a Senate
committee from approving James Cason's nomination to a top natural
resources post will take their fight against him to the Senate
floor.
   ``We are disappointed we didn't win the committee vote,'' Reid
Wilson of the SierraClub said after the Agriculture Committee's
12-7 vote Thursday in favor of Cason. ``But we think it was close
enough to set up a tight struggle on the Senate floor and we are
going to go all out.''
   ``Once the senators hear in depth about this man's record they
are going to be concerned,'' Wilson said.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., urged a
vote against Cason, saying his record in the Interior Department
under President Reagan showed an ``unwillingness to protect the
environment.''
   But committee Republicans, joined by Democratic Sens. Howell
Heflin of Alabama, David Pryor of Arkansas and David Boren of
Oklahoma, voted to send the full Senate Cason's nomination to be
assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources.
   Boren and Pryor said, however, they might vote against Cason
after the floor debate.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., argued against Cason's confirmation
and said he might try to block a full Senate vote unless he is
convinced Cason can be trusted to protect the public over private
interests.
   Conrad criticized Cason's decision at Interior in 1986 to sell
federal land at ``fire sale prices'' of $2.50 an acre. He said the
government made $17,000 on the sale to private interests who weeks
later resold it for $37 million.
   ``When Congress was considering legislation stopping those
transactions, Mr. Cason went to Colorado and urged investors to
file claims before Congress acted,'' Conrad said.
   Conrad also said Cason cut back on audits of companies buying
oil from wells on public and Indian land. He said the change in
procedures cost the government and the tribes ``tens, perhaps
hundreds of millions of dollars.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the
committee, said his earlier reservations about Cason were answered
when Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter assured him Cason
would take orders from Yeutter.
   The committee unanimously approved Yeutter's nomination earlier
this year and has supported his work at the Agriculture Department.
   Lugar also said he believed Cason had become much more sensitive
to environmental concerns during the committee's confirmation
hearings.
   Cason appeared before the committee for two days as senators
questioned him about decisions favoring private interests he made
while at Interior during the Reagan administration.
   After the hearings, Leahy called on Bush to withdraw the
nomination.
   Among other problems, Leahy said evidence showed Cason
suppressed a report in 1986 that warned of irreversible
environmental damage, including survival of the spotted owl, if
logging was allowed in certain areas of the Pacific Northwest.
Cason said he withheld the report because he wanted more
information.
   Cason, who has held various high posts at Interior since the
early 1980s, would be in charge of the U.S. Forest Service, if
confirmed. He also would oversee conservation programs affecting
agricultural land.

<HEAD>Defaults in Supplemental Student Loans Jump 1,664 percent</HEAD>

   A government audit shows defaults on loans
from a new federal student financial aid program skyrocketed by
1,664 percent in three years, and defaults are getting just as bad
with borrowers from trade schools.
   The General Accounting Office found loan defaults in the
Supplemental Loans to Students (SLS) programs increased from $14
million in fiscal year 1987 to $40 million in 1988, and to $247
million in 1989.
   The amount of SLS loans doubled in that time, the GAO said in a
report released Thursday.
   ``Students attending proprietary (profit-making) schools
generally have higher default rates. These figures are not
dissimilar to what we have seen with the other student aid
programs,'' William Gainer, director of education and employment
for the GAO.
   Gainer said more than $3.2 billion in the Supplemental Loans to
Students (SLS) program have been guaranteed by nine lenders _
mainly banks, credit unions and savings and loan associations _ in
the last three years.
   Students defaulted on $310.6 million during that period, the
nine agencies reported.
   The SLS program, enacted in 1986, provides market-rate loans.
Higher education students are eligible for an SLS loan, after first
meeting more stringent eligibility requirements of other
government-guaranteed loans, such as Pell grants and Stafford
loans, formerly called guaranteed student loans.
   Although the main purpose of the loan is to supplement other
aid, Gainer said the audit found 419,434 student borrowers received
only SLS loans during the three years compared to 673,458 who
received both SLS and Stafford loans.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.,
requested the GAO study.
   Under the SLS program, graduate students and those
undergraduates responsible for their own financial support are
allowed to borrow up to $4,000 per year, to a maximum of $20,000.
Unlike the Stafford loans and Pell grants, eligibility is not based
on a borrowers' financial resources.
   SLS loans have variable interest rates, adjusted annually
according to Treasury Department borrowing rates. Repayment must
generally begin within 60 days of the last loan disbursement for
each year a loan is received.
   According to the Education Department, the loan volume increased
from $564 million in the 1987 fiscal year to $1.347 billion in the
1988 fiscal year, and dropped slightly to $1.294 billion in 1989.
   The amount of loans to proprietary or trade school borrowers
increased from 55 percent to about 60 percent from the 1987 to 1989
fiscal years, the GAO found. At the same time, the amount of loans
to freshmen borrowers increased from 40 percent of SLS loans 1987
to about 63 percent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   Loan defaults from freshmen increased from 12 percent of all
defaults in 1987 to 85 percent in 1989.
   Similarly, defaults from proprietary school borrowers increased
from 12 percent of SLS loan defaults in 1987 to 86 percent in 1989.

   The 32-year-old Oakland freeway
reduced to dust and debris by this week's earthquake had a history
of minor problems, including some that weren't fixed promptly,
according to state inspection reports.
   The California Transportation Department reports, made available
Thursday, include one from 1966 describing a sagging road deck that
made it difficult for drivers to control cars.
   A 1961 report talked of ``above-average cracks'' in several deck
sections and a 1980 report suggested about $455,000 worth of
repairs such as resealing joints and replacing expansion beams. The
work wasn't immediately done and was suggested again in a 1983
report.
   Other problems ranged from hairline cracks and clogged drains to
auto damage to rails, flaking concrete, bent spans and a cracked
girder.
   ``(But) there was no problem of structural failure at all,''
state Transportation Director Robert Best said of the reports.
   Best also said engineers delayed strengthening the section of
freeway because they believed it would survive a major quake.
   ``We didn't know 10 years ago this was subject to this type of
earthquake damage. We did not know there was any possibility it
would collapse,'' he said.
   Best said he was unaware of a private engineer's report from
1975 saying that the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed had
an outdated design that made it vulnerable to such quakes.
   ``I've been assured there were no experts, no studies, no data
that suggested in any way that it would fall,'' Best said.
   A 1\-mile-long stretch of the two-tiered interstate, also called
the Nimitz Freeway, collapsed in Tuesday's earthquake. An upper
section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge also collapsed.
   Gov. George Deukmejian has called for an immediate investigation
of I-880's collapse. A commission of bridge engineers is being set
up to determine why the structure fell and what can be done to
prevent such tragedies, Best said.
   Engineer J. David Rogers said he determined in his 1975 study
that the structure wouldn't survive a major earthquake. And he said
the information was presented to state transportation officials at
that time.
   Best said it is irresponsible to suggest the state knew the
structure would collapse. He said it's possible there were
``unusual subsurface conditions that we didn't know about'' that
could have contributed to the collapse. The highway was built on
fill dirt.
   Rogers blamed the collapse on wood-fiber expansion joints on the
columns that held up the highway, The Washington Post reported
today.
   Asked why the late designer of the highway, F.W. Panhorst, used
the joints, Rogers said: ``God only knows. ... It creates a
tremendous weakness position for the columns.''
   The failed structure had undergone only the first phase of a
three-step program to reinforce California's roadways.
   Work on I-880 began in 1977 and was the first improvement since
the highway was designed in 1954 and constructed in 1957.
   But the work on I-880 and other roads with double-column
supports was deferred while officials focused on phase two, shoring
up single-column elevated roadways.
   The third phase, now under way, calls for research with the
University of California to figure out how to strengthen
multiple-column supports of multi-level elevated highways.
   Officials maintained that I-880 was not neglected or given too
low a priority in the project.
   However, John Kariotis, a South Pasadena structural engineer who
studies earthquakes, said the state could have ``colossally
reduced'' the danger by sheathing the columns in steel jackets,
according to the Post.

   A federal grand jury will hear the
government's case against a former military communications officer
who claims he sought to aid the United States when he allegedly
gave classified information to the Soviets.
   Magistrate W. Curtis Sewell ordered Frank Nesbitt, 44, held
without bail Thursday. FBI agents arrested Nesbitt last week at a
hotel in McLean, Va., and charged him with delivering and
attempting to deliver unauthorized information to Soviet agents.
   Nesbitt's court-appointed attorney, Gregory English, told
reporters his client, a former Marine and Air Force communications
officer, ``felt it was a chance to benefit the United States'' and
``wanted to have some excitement in his life.''
   The government's only witness, FBI Special Agent Lizzie Cassell,
testified about conversations she had with Nesbitt starting Oct. 4.
in which he told her about passing information, later determined by
the National Security Agency to be classified, to the Soviets.
   Ms. Cassell said Nesbitt came to the FBI office in Washington,
D.C., accompanied by an official from the U.S. Embassy in
Guatemala, to tell his story.
   According to the agent, Nesbitt left his wife and two children
near Memphis, Tenn., last June. Leaving behind a note Ms. Cassell
said read, ``Don't look for me, I'm gone,'' Nesbitt began an
odyssey that took him from Central and South America to the Soviet
Union and back to Guatemala.
   Ms. Cassell said Nesbitt told her he met by happenstance a
Soviet official, Feodor Temoyev, during his travels in Bolivia. The
Soviet made arrangements for a trip for Nesbitt to the Soviet Union.
   ``He stated to me he had defected,'' Ms. Cassell told the court.
   She said Nesbitt gave classified communications intelligence
information to the Soviets during his 10-day stay in Moscow and
also provided Soviet agents with diagrams and charts.
   English said his client believed the information he passed on
was unclassified and argued there was no intent to harm the U.S.
government. He said Nesbitt also had broached the idea of working
as a double agent when he voluntarily went to the FBI.
   Nesbitt served from 1963 to 1966 in the Air Force's Electronic
Security Command in West Germany and from 1969 to 1979 in the
Marine Corps, where he dealt with classified
communication-gathering. He also worked at the Los Alamos National
Laboratories from 1983 to 1984. He had top secret code word
clearance in all his jobs.
   Ms. Cassell said Nesbitt told her he was paid $2,000 for the
information he provided to the Soviets and would receive up to
$100,000 if he would return to the Los Alamos plant and obtain
other secrets. She said Nesbitt agreed.
   Nesbitt faces a minimum sentence of 30 years in prison and a
maximum of a life sentence if convicted.

   Some legislative leaders have proposed
special taxes to pay for earthquake damage, and Gov. George
Deukmejian said he may support a new levy.
   ``If we don't have enough (money) in terms of what we have on
hand, I have not ruled out the possibility of a tax increase to
raise whatever funds necessary to bring the communities back to
normal,'' Deukmejian told reporters Thursday while touring badly
damaged Santa Cruz.
   The state has an emergency reserve fund of just over $1 billion
that can be spent without legislative approval.
   Tuesday's earthquake has caused well over $4 billion in damage,
according to the state. Some private economists say it may reach
$10 billion.
   Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a Democrat from San Francisco,
has said he would prefer a short-term increase in the gasoline or
sales tax to pay for quake repairs.
   ``I don't really think we should be relying on the budget
reserve to rebuild the Bay Bridge or the freeway,'' he said of the
collapsed Nimitz Freeway in Oakland.
   Brown met Thursday with 17 Bay area-legislators, some of whom
had their own ideas about how to raise earthquake repair money.
   Assemblyman Dick Floyd said there should be a one-year,
25-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax surcharge to raise $3.5 billion to
help repair the damage and to strengthen bridges, overpasses and
elevated highways statewide.
   Deukmejian, a Republican, was scheduled to meet legislative
leaders _ including Brown _ on Monday.
   The governor said there is precedent for a special tax. He said
motor fuel taxes have at times been raised to pay for roads damaged
in natural disasters.
   He said a special legislative session _ which only he could call
_ would be required.
   The 17 legislators who met Thursday with Brown agreed
unanimously to a special session and said transportation and
housing needs should be the top priorities.
   The lawmakers ended their regular 1989 session in September and
are not due to return until January.

<HEAD>U.S. Mulling Response to Major Political Moves in Baltics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government is considering how to
respond if the Kremlin cracks down on freedom movements in the
Baltic republics or if those states gain independence from the
Soviet Union, says a senior State Department official.
   The United States has never recognized Soviet annexation of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which were occupied by the Red Army
during World War II, and that policy has come under new scrutiny
with the upsurge of independence movements there.
   ``Our basic policy of non-recognition has not changed and it is
not going to change,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James F.
Dobbins testified Thursday before the congressional Commission on
Peace and Security in Europe.
   Activists in the Baltic republics, encouraged by the reforms of
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, have been campaigning for more
independence, but have drawn sharp warnings from Gorbachev and
other Kremlin officials.
   ``We are going to have to develop well-considered administration
responses to this,'' Dobbins said. ``Many of us who have not been
experts on the Baltic republics are becoming Baltic experts.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze assured Secretary
of State James A. Baker III at their meeting in Wyoming last month
that the Kremlin would not use force against the Baltic
independence movements.
   However, a private attorney told the congressional panel on
Thursday the approach by the U.S. and other Western governments was
too timid and disorganized to ensure a peaceful solution.
   ``Western statesmen have reacted to the resurgence of peaceful,
democratic, Baltic mass movements with nervous confusion and
anxiety,'' testified William Hough, a New York attorney.
   ``Not one Western state, to my knowledge, has ever proposed a
plan for independence for the Baltic states or proposed a peaceful
diplomatic solution for the Baltic region that would take into
account the security interests of nation's of East-Central Europe,
including the U.S.S.R,'' said Hough.
   Arvydas Juozaitis, a leader of Lithuania's Sajudis popular
front, told The Associated Press recently that his movement expects
to win a 80 percent majority in elections scheduled for next
February in Lithuania, one of 15 Soviet republics.
   One of the first acts of the Lithuanian parliament will be to
dissolve itself and vote to form a new government, independent of
the Soviet Union, Juozaitis said.
   Lithuania would then seek to establish ties with Moscow on the
basis of a 1939 treaty which affirms Lithuanian independence but
allows the Soviet Union to maintain military bases in the republic.
   ``To achieve some agreement with Moscow, we will agree that
Soviet troops can remain in Lithuania,'' Juozaitis said.
   Asked whether there was any flexibility in the Sajudis position,
Juozaitis said: ``I suppose. A lot of maneuvering can occur in the
nearest future, before the Lithuanian Soviet sits.''
   ``We are not expecting that the Soviets would use force before a
radical decision is taken. They have no argument for using force
before a decision is taken,'' he said.
   ``One of our most decisive tasks is to win time. If we win a
month, we are happy because there are big changes every month,'' he
said.
   The Bush administration favors democratic elections to ``allow
the Baltic peoples do decide these questions themselves,'' Dobbins
told the congressional panel headed by Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
   ``We, the administration and other governments, have to consider
how we can best promote that process,'' he said. ``We are prepared
to respect and enthusiastically support whatever the results of the
process of self-determination are.''
   The congressional panel underscored U.S. support for Baltic
independence by hearing testimony from the heads of the Estonian,
Latvian and Lithuanian legations, who represent their governments
in exile.
   It was the first time in 35 years the emigre missions had
testified before Congress, said the legation heads, Stasys
Lozoraitis of Lithuania, Anatol Dinbergs of Latvia and Ernst
Jaakson of Estonia.

   Lessons learned in a 1983 Connecticut
bridge disaster could provide a blueprint for engineers seeking to
rebuild a collapsed section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge, officials say.
   The engineers who designed a temporary span on the Mianus River
bridge on Interstate 95 are suddenly in demand, as are hundreds of
structural engineers around the country who could reap a windfall
from the San Francisco earthquake.
   Clem Zawodiak, director of the Connecticut Department of
Transportation, said Thursday that the Army Corps of Engineers had
asked for the names of contractors and equipment used in the
reconstruction of the Mianus bridge.
   A three-lane section of southbound I-95 collapsed on June 28,
1983, killing three people. The accident was blamed on a failed
hanger system that supported the bridge's steel girders.
   The highway is a major transportation link between Connecticut
and New York City and is used daily by thousands of commuters.
   A two-lane, temporary span once described as ``a giant Erector
set'' was built over the gaping hole in the interstate in 22 days.
On July 22, 1983, the temporary span was opened to light traffic.
   While the temporary bridge was in place, crews worked below to
construct three new, permanent lanes. It was the first time such a
procedure was used to rebuild a bridge. The reconstructed bridge
was opened to traffic in January 1984.
   In San Francisco, a 50-foot, five-lane section of the upper deck
of the Bay Bridge collapsed onto the lower deck during Tuesday's
earthquake. The collapse has closed a vital link for those
commuting between San Francisco and Oakland.
   Zawodniak said California transportation officials could
construct a temporary span similar to the one used on the Mianus
bridge. However, because the Bay Bridge has two levels, he said, he
wasn't sure if construction could take place while the temporary
span was in place.
   The earthquake, which also caused the collapse of a 1\-mile
stretch of Interstate 880 in Oakland, has drawn hundreds of
structural engineers to Northern California.
   The engineers _ most of whom are government employees, but some
of whom are private contractors _ are crawling around buildings,
elevators, dams, highways, bridges, pipelines and other structures
that might have suffered damage.
   Bill Killeen, vice president of engineering for Acrow Corp. of
America, which built the temporary Mianus River span, said his
company has contacted California transportation officials. But he
declined to say whether his company might become involved in
reparing the Bay Bridge.
   ``We're sharing ideas with the state,'' Killeen said.
   Acrow's bridges use a series of 10-by-5-foot panels connected in
rows to form trusses. Beams are placed between them to form a
bridge deck. In addition to Mianus, the technology was used to
erect temporary bridges in Washington state in the wake of the
Mount St. Helen's volcano in 1980.
   Peter Shugert, spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers in New
York, said the corps solicited information about Mianus as a
courtesy to California officials. Corps engineers said they didn't
know if the Mianus technology would be applied to the Bay bridge.
   ``We were looking for anything that would help them,'' Shugert
said.

<HEAD>Government Solar Experts Report Major Solar Flare, Warn Of Magnetic
Storm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major magnetic storm unleashed by a giant
solar flare is forecast to surge about the Earth today, possibly
causing power surges, radio blackouts and shimmering lights near
the poles.
   Sun watchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said the flare erupted on the sun Thursday morning
and almost immediately saturated instruments aboard a NOAA
satellite with X-rays.
   Norman Cohen, a geophysical forecaster at the Space Environment
Services Center run by NOAA in Boulder, Colo., said he was sending
alerts to electrical utilities in Canada and in the northern United
States to expect possible power surges today when a powerful
magnetic storm is expected to arrive at the Earth.
   Radiation from strong solar flares can affect satellites and
spacecraft, but officials at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said Thursday they evaluated the burst of energy and
determined astronauts on board the orbiting space shuttle Atlantis
are not in danger.
   ``In the orbit we're in, at 160 miles altitude, it is no threat
at all,'' said Ronald D. Dittemore, a flight director at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``We're not concerned at all.''
   A NASA spokesman said Galileo, the probe released from Atlantis
six hours after the space shuttle was launched Wednesday, was built
to resist radiation much stronger than solar flares and will not be
affected. Galileo is almost a quarter-million miles from Earth on
its six-year journey to Jupiter.
   Cohen said the solar flare generated such a strong burst of
X-rays that instruments on NOAA's GOES satellite were overwhelmed.
The satellite detects the radiation up to X-12, a term used to
measure X-ray flux. The flare was estimated to be an X-13.
   The flare also produced a proton burst that Cohen said was about
1,000 times stronger than the flux of protons from a quiet sun.
   ``We measured 2,000 particles per cubic centimeter per second,''
said Cohen. ``A quiet sun will have 2 or 3 particles.''
   Protons are energetic particles than can affect electronic
equipment in high-flying satellites, particularly those orbiting
the poles.
   Cohen said a major geomagnetic storm should erupt today and
continue for two days.
   Energy from such storms can knock out long-distance radio
transmissions, disrupt land-line communications and cause power
surges in unprotected power transmission wires, particularly in far
northern and southern latitudes. A similar storm in March caused
some blackouts in Canada.
   ``Radio communications over the poles will be wiped out'' during
the storm, Cohen forecast. He said an alert was being sent to the
Canadian government.
   The flare occurred as solar activity is rising toward the top of
its current 11-year cycle, which began in 1986. A flare of similar
strength was recorded in August.
   Cohen said the flare erupted from a group of sunspots near the
center of the solar disc as viewed from Earth. It will take about a
week for the sunspot group to move out of view from Earth and it
could produce more major flares.
   ``That would not be surprising,'' said Cohen.
   Solar flares may also produce an aurora, the spectacular display
of shimmering colors over the poles known in the northern
hemisphere as the northern lights. Solar storms earlier this year
created a northern light display visible as far south as Denver.

   There is a sense of triumph amid the death
and destruction of the earthquake that struck California.
   Skyscrapers shook but didn't fall. Trains stopped but most were
running again within hours. Businesses closed for a day to assess
damage, then reopened. The Bay Bridge was crippled, so thousands of
commuters switched to ferries.
   Police and fire officials maintained order. Hospitals stayed
open with auxiliary power. Radio and television kept up a critical
flow of information to the public.
   Perhaps most important, though, the vast majority of people
didn't panic. Instead, they comforted and helped each other, taking
in neighbors and strangers.
   The quake created heroes, from a surgeon who rescued a child
trapped on the collapsed Interstate 880 freeway to the thousands
who worked round the clock coping with the crisis.
   ``If this was a test of the San Francisco Bay area's ability to
respond to a major earthquake, we got an `A,''' says Steven Levy,
director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the
California Economy.
   ``There are more than 6 million people in the Bay area and a
couple of hundred people died,'' Levy said Thursday, two days after
the quake. ``It's horrible for the families of victims and
traumatic for everyone, but it's not in the realm of a regional
economic disaster.''
   Certainly, there were failures and lessons to be learned.
   Commuters trapped in a Bay Area Rapid Transit train beneath the
bay when power went out complained they weren't given enough
information by BART officials about the quake.
   The San Francisco Fire Department said it was understaffed and
stretched to the limit in fighting blazes. Mayor Art Agnos said he
was ``ticked off'' that Vice President Dan Quayle failed to consult
with him during a tour of city.
   And questions continue about why I-880 crumbled and why a
section of the Bay Bridge fell like a trap door.
   Seen from a helicopter, though, San Francisco and Oakland remain
remarkably intact. The towers of steel, concrete and glass in both
cities stand tall in defiance of a jolt that sent shock waves 750
miles up and down the coast and eastward through the Central Valley
and Sierra Nevada.
   ``It speaks a lot for the design code of modern buildings and
the preparedness of California that there wasn't more damage,''
said George Lee, acting director of the National Center for
Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of New York
at Buffalo.
   The skyscrapers were unharmed, Lee said, because they were
``overdesigned'' to prevent sway in upper levels and to resist
powerful wind gusts as much as earthquakes.
   ``I think we're going to learn a lot from this event,'' Lee
said. ``Many of the buildings have instruments that can determine
stresses and strains. We know the original designs of these
buildings and we know the ground motion and amplitude. Adding these
together will give us a very good picture where the weak links are
and that will improve designs for the future.''
   Most small buildings and homes throughout the Bay area also
survived with little or no damage, unlike those that crumbled in
Soviet Armenia when a similar 6.9 magnitude quake struck last
December and left 25,000 people dead and tens of thousands homeless.
   The economic toll of the California quake is already estimated
at $4 billion and, according to Frank McCormick, a top economist
for the Bank of America in San Francisco, is likely to reach $10
billion. But that represents only about a month's worth of the Bay
area's $125 billion annual economy, he said, and will be offset
quickly by a boost to the economy from reconstruction jobs,
insurance payments and federal assistance.
   Within a day of the quake, trucks were moving in and out of the
Port of Oakland, which handles 1,700 vessels a month.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco continued to process
cash, checks and wire transfers ``without a glitch,'' according to
a spokesman. Most large banks used emergency generators to keep
their computers operating.
   San Francisco and Oakland international airports resumed
operations Wednesday. San Jose's was shut down for only three hours
Tuesday night.
   The ultimate triumphs, though, were personal. Len Jann, a
station agent for BART, worked 18 hours day from Tuesday afternoon
until Wednesday morning to help people.
   ``We worked the whole night just to make sure people could get
back across the bay, and we stayed with them to make them feel they
weren't alone in this,'' he said.
   Among those he aided were three women _ one black, one white,
one Asian _ who were stuck in San Francisco. Jann and his
co-workers watched over the women as they huddled together in the
BART station until 1 a.m., then drove them to the ferry and
arranged to have their husbands meet them in Oakland.
   ``Race, origin, what they did for a living, nothing mattered,''
he said. ``These three ladies banded together. That was typical of
how everybody acted. The whole Bay area banded together and
survived.''

<HEAD>Number of Cases of Skin Cancer Leveling Off After Sharp Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After decades of soaring rates of skin cancer _
largely because of suntanning _ Americans finally may be wising up
to the dangers of the bronzed look, a medical researcher says.
   Rates of malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin
cancer, appeared to start leveling off in 1988, after 27 years of
steep rises, said Dr. Andrew Glass of Kaiser Permanente's Center
for Health Research in Portland, Ore.
   ``It's going to take some more time to follow that along,''
Glass said in a telephone interview Thursday. But early figures
from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., appear to
indicate a similar leveling off, he said.
   Glass' remarks came after he reported on a long-term tracking of
300,000 members of the Kaiser Permanente prepaid health plan in the
Portland, Ore., and Vancouver, Wash., areas.
   Researchers found that from 1960 to 1987, annual cases of a type
of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma increased 2.6 times
in men and 3.1 times in women.
   Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the commonest skin cancers,
occurring in thousands of people each year. Usually starting as a
scaly patch on the lip, ear or hand, it grows, spreads and even
causes death if untreated.
   ``Squamous cell skin cancer clearly seems to be related to skin
exposure _ it is more common among fair-skinned individuals,
especially those with frequent or long-term exposure to sunlight,''
said a report by Glass and Dr. Robert N. Hoover of the National
Cancer Institute.
   Their findings represent the first systematic report over time
of squamous cell skin cancer, they said.
   The researchers also looked at melanoma, and found its incidence
rose 3.5-fold and 4.6-fold among men and women, respectively,
during the same 27-year period.
   Greater exposure to sunlight is only one of many factors
believed to have contributed to the increased rates of melanoma,
the researchers said in their report in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   But the occurrence of melanomas on the body's trunk rose much
faster than cancers involving the head and neck or the extremities,
the researchers said.
   ``These observations are consistent with the impression that the
rising incidence of both malignancies may be attributable to
increased voluntary exposure to the sun,'' said the researchers.
   Malignant melanoma, which often starts in an existing mole that
becomes enlarged, is the kind of cancer most likely to spread and
kill.
   Researchers found 2,453 cases of invasive skin cancers among
members of the health plan.
   The American Cancer Society has estimated that half of all
people who live to age 65 will have skin cancer at some point in
their lives and predicted malignant melanoma will kill 6,000 people
this year.
   ``As individuals and as a society, it is only prudent to take
precautions to save our skins,'' said an editorial in the journal
by Dr. Martin A. Weinstock of Brown University in Providence, R.I.
   He called for preservation of the earth's ozone layer, which
blocks harmful ultraviolet radiation, and early detection and
treatment of skin cancers, as well as increased public awareness
and use of sunscreens.

<HEAD>New Cell Culture Technique Holds Promise for Burn Patients</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Skin Cancer, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors cultivating healthy skin in a bed of cow
protein say the new cell culture technique may allow severely
burned patients to ``grow'' stronger and more resilient skin.
   The new technique has the potential of helping thousands of
severely burned patients, said Dr. John F. Hansbrough, director of
the burn center at the University of California, San Diego Medical
Center.
   ``When we put this on the patient and it takes and grows,''
Hansbrough said, ``there are certain structural proteins formed
that anchor the skin to the body ... very early, and that's the
real breakthrough.''
   Hansbrough and his colleagues, Steven T. Boyce of the University
of Cincinnati Medical Center, and Dr. Matthew L. Cooper and Tanya
J. Foreman of UCSD, published their findings in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   The researchers said they cultivated areas of skin several times
the size of the palm of the hand. They reported on results in four
patients who had successful grafts on burns covering from 43
percent to 74 percent of their bodies.
   The new technique shows evidence of allowing a graft to anchor
to the body within nine days, compared with the ``four weeks to six
months to a year'' for cultured human skin cells alone to attach
fully to the body, Hansbrough said in a telephone interview
Thursday.
   The grafts produced by the new technique also appear to be
stronger and more resilient. At present, many fragile grafts from
cultured skin cells are lost in the laboratory, the researchers
said.
   The new technique will take three to five years to develop for
general use, the researchers said. It promises to save patients who
die because doctors are unable to harvest enough healthy skin from
them before they succumb to infections, Hansbrough said.
   It could also save on medical costs by greatly reducing the
amount of time patients need to spend in intensive care, he said.
   At $3,000 to $5,000 a day for intensive care, ``if we could
eliminate even one month of hospitalization, that would be
$100,000,'' he said.
   An editorial accompanying the study acknowledged the new
skin-grafting technique's apparent advantages of rapid anchoring to
the body and easier handling in the laboratory.
   Unanswered questions about the new technique include whether it
promotes faster development of circulation in the graft than those
in current use, and whether the technique will work as well on
large areas of skin as it does on the small ones used in the study.
   The researchers used a latticework of cow or ox collagen, a
protein that is one of the main building materials in animal
tissues, and laced it with human cells of fibroblast, connective
tissue that gives skin its resilience. They then placed a layer of
outer skin cells on top and cultivated the graft in the laboratory.
   Animal collagen was used because it is readily available and is
virtually identical at the cell level to human collagen, Hansbrough
said.

   For Goldie Pennington, the earthquake was
like an intruder who robbed her of her most precious worldly
possession: the place where she and her family lived.
   ``It was like somebody took everything I had and threw me out in
the streets,'' said Mrs. Pennington, 47, lying on a Red Cross cot
and keeping a watchful eye on two grandchildren at an emergency
shelter.
   ``At least we have a roof over our heads and food to eat. You
can always start over.'' Mrs. Pennington said. ``The unexpected can
happen to anybody, rich or poor.''
   The woman, her three children and two grandchildren were unable
to stay in their city apartment because the earthquake split open
walls and caused other damage. She stayed with a friend for two
nights before checking into the shelter set up at the Moscone
Convention Center.
   In the city, 2,555 people are staying in three Red Cross
shelters. Ten thousand people were left homeless in Santa Cruz
County, according to the state Office of Emergency Preparedness.
Most are staying with relatives or in hotels instead of in shelters.
   Life for the newly homeless consists of bare essentials: donated
meals, bottled water, restrooms, a cot and a blanket or sleeping
bag.
   Among the few frills were puppet shows for the kids, donated
stuffed animals, chalkboards, jigsaw puzzles, playing cards and an
occasional television. The Red Cross dispensed toothbrushes and
other toiletries.
   The Moscone Center was supposed to have greeted delegates of the
Water Pollution Control Federation before Tuesday's quake hit.
Instead of exhibitors, about 90 families were housed in one hall.
Other cots were crammed under escalators and in the crannies of the
lobby.
   ``People still don't feel safe outside. It's better to be here
than to be alone,'' said shelter manager Bob Puett.
   The shelter people were a motley bunch, thrown together by
chance and circumstance. Those displaced by the quake bunked with
the city's considerable homeless population who didn't have places
to lose.
   As a way to beat the monotony, Chris Buell worked as a
volunteer, helping people set up their cots, showing them locations
of restrooms and offering a reassuring hand.
   ``Everything I have is gone. It's history. I'm still walking
around in a daze,'' said Buell, 28, a professional boxer who
escaped from his apartment in the Marina district with the clothes
on his back and $5 in his pocket.
   ``I'm stuck right now, so I might as well be helping people,''
Buell said.
   The Red Cross offered snacks, juice, fruit and coffee. It also
provided disposable diapers and baby food for fidgety infants such
as 11-month-old Hannah Watson, who was nursed by her mother, Terri.
   ``It seems like a nightmare,'' said Mrs. Watson, 29, whose
apartment had a big crack in the ceiling and was uninhabitable.
``The first feeling was how it seemed like we were cut off from the
rest of the world. I just feel so helpless.''
   In the middle of the room, Blanca Manzanero entertained her
three daughters with donated dolls and playthings. The woman drove
into the city to see her lawyer and was trapped when a section of
the Bay Bridge collapsed.
   She still hasn't built up the nerve to try driving 30 milies
home to Vallejo, where her husband is staying.
   ``I'm so afraid the freeway has a big hole in it. I want to wait
until it's safe,'' Mrs. Manzanero said. ``It's better to stay here.
It's the safest place for me.''
   In the fashionable Marina district, 500 families are bunking at
the Marina Middle School. John and Linda Reda tossed what they
could into the back of their blue Volvo station wagon and headed
for the shelter.
   ``I just wanted to have my family albums. They're all my
memories. You can rebuild a house,'' said Mrs. Reda, who is five
months pregnant.

<HEAD>House-Senate Negotiators Endorse Compensation for Japanese-Americans.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators have endorsed
legislation guaranteeing $20,000 compensation payments to the
estimated 60,000 living Japanese-Americans who were rounded up and
sent to internment camps during World War II.
   The compromise legislation approved Thursday, which could pay
the former internees as much as $1.2 billion over three years, must
next be passed by both houses of Congress before being sent to the
White House for consideration by President Bush.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has opposed the payments on
grounds they are too costly. Bush has not made his position known.
   The reparations payments are part of an overall $17.3 billion
measure providing appropriations for the Commerce, State and
Justice departments for the 1990 fiscal year which opened Oct. 1.
   House negotiators accepted the Senate-passed version of the bill
making the reparations payments an entitlement and guaranteeing
that all of the still-living internees will receive them.
   The Senate voted 74-22 on Sept. 29 to waive budget restrictions
and guarantee the reparations payments are made.
   The Senate version of the bill, which the conference approved,
bars any payments until the beginning of the next fiscal year on
Oct. 1, 1991.
   But it then makes up to $500 million a year available over three
years until all of the $20,000 reparations payments are made.

<NOTE>Drug Czar Admits Drugs Problem In Nation's Capital Worsening</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug crisis in the nation's capital is
getting worse despite a six-month joint partnership by federal and
local authorities fighting the problem, says National Drug Policy
Coordinator William J. Bennett.
   ``No one should be surprised to learn that the nation's capital
is still plagued by a serious drug problem,'' Bennett said at a
news conference Thursday. ``We picked a difficult task last April,
and I never had any illusions about the challenges that lay before
us.''
   Bennett made his remarks while issuing a six-month ``progress
report'' on a special initiative he generated to help the District
of Columbia curb its record murder rate and drug-related crime wave.
   So far in 1989, 360 persons have been killed in the district, 12
short of the all-time annual record set last year. By this time in
1988, 270 homicides had been reported in Washington. Police blame
drugs, particularly crack cocaine, for more than 60 percent of
these deaths.

<NOTE>Group Says Common Practices Not in Consumers' Interest</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group is charging that merchants
across the country are handling personal checks and credit card
transactions in ways that may lead to fraud and invasion of privacy.
   The organization, Bankcard Holders of America, on Thursday
assailed the practice of many merchants requiring customers who pay
for purchases with personal checks to provide a major credit card
number and expiration date, plus a telephone number. This
information is then written on the check.
   ``Store clerks often pressure consumers into writing their
bankcard numbers on personal checks, but these consumers don't
realize the potential danger in doing so,'' the group's director,
Elgie Holstein, told a news conference.
   He contended that ``mail order fraud and application fraud are
increasingly popular crimes, and placing this information (a card's
number and expiration date) on a personal check enables a thief to
make purchases or apply for credit in the customer's name.
   ``Requiring customers to present a major credit card as
identification, or even noting on the check that the consumer holds
a Visa or MasterCard, can be an appropriate merchant practice,''
Holstein said. ``It is dangerous, however, to require credit card
numbers to be written on checks.''
   To help consumers deal with this practice, the organization is
making available a wallet-sized ``Consumer Action Card'' to present
to merchants who insist on writing credit card numbers on personal
checks. The wallet card alerts merchants that recording this
information encourages fraud and may violate a customer's privacy.

   A man seeking to become the nation's first
elected black governor was sharply critical of his opponent for
invoking the name of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr. in a televised debate.
   Republican J. Marshall Coleman, a former state attorney general,
twice referred to King Thursday in defending his commitment to
affirmative action.
   ``What we want is a society that is open to everyone, regardless
of color,'' said Coleman, who said he worked as a University of
Virginia student to get Charlottesville restaurants to desegregate.
   Coleman said he supported King's view that people should be
judged on their character and not their skin color.
   But Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, the state's lieutenant governor,
said it was ``almost despicable' that Coleman linked himself to
King.
   Wilder responded angrily that the late Gov. John N. Dalton cast
a veto ``that you encouraged'' of a bill creating a state holiday
to honor King.
   The hourlong debate was the candidates' final televised debate
before the Nov. 7 election.
   Coleman focused on taxes during the debate. ``What I want to do
is hold the line on taxes,'' Coleman said. ``As a Democrat, he can
be expected to raise taxes.''
   But Wilder said he has fought repeatedly to repeal the sales tax
on food and non-prescription drugs as well as for the pension tax
relief.
   Coleman also charged Wilder with switching from anti-death
penalty to a pro-capital punishment stand and with once supporting
collective bargaining for public employees.
   The issue that dominated the first debate, abortion, hardly was
mentioned by the candidates.
   Wilder made a reference in his closing remarks about not
returning to government interference in the private lives of its
citizens and at another point said Coleman promised his
anti-abortion supporters their views would be represented in
appointments to state offices.
   The debate coincided with the release of a new poll showing
Wilder and Coleman virtually in a dead heat. The Mason-Dixon
Opinion Research Inc. poll showed 45 percent for Wilder to 43
percent for Coleman. The poll's margin of error was 3{ percentage
points either way.
   Since the last Mason-Dixon poll on Sept. 20, Wilder has gained 8
points and Coleman has dropped 1 point.
   The current governor, Democrat Gerald L. Baliles, is barred by
the state Constitution from seeking a second consecutive term.

   An environmental group says construction
standards for nuclear power plants should be re-examined in the
wake of the powerful San Francisco Bay area earthquake.
   There are five active nuclear power plants in California, but
all are in Southern California, and the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission says Tuesday's quake caused no damage to the nuclear
reactors.
   But Ken Bossong, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass
Energy Project, said nationwide at least two nuclear plants are
``perilously close to known fault lines.''
   He cited Diablo Canyon, which is southwest of San Luis Obispo,
Calif., near the Hosgri fault, and Millstone, near the point at
which the Honey Hill and Lake Char fault lines intersect in
Connecticut.
   ``Federal regulators should at least view (the California)
earthquake as a final warning that seismic standards and testing
for all nuclear reactors as well as evacuation planning needs to be
substantially upgraded before the next quake hits,'' said Bossong.
   The Energy Department also acknowledges its three active nuclear
reactors at the Savannah River weapons complex in South Carolina,
which make materials for nuclear warheads, need to undergo seismic
upgrades, he said.
   Frank Ingram, an NRC spokesman, said the three nuclear reactors
in California that were running at the time of the quake are still
running normally.
   The five plants in Southern California are: two at Diablo Canyon
and three at San Onofre, five miles south of San Clemente. One
reactor at each site was shut down for normal refueling when the
quake hit.
   Under the 1973 standards set by the NRC, each nuclear power
plant must be built to quake-resistance specifications that differ
according to local seismic conditions. The standards for Diablo
Canyon are the stiffest in the country, Ingram said.
   The risk of nuclear plant accidents from earthquakes was a major
point of contention between the industry and environmentalists
during the 1960s and early 1970s, when site planning was done for
most of the 110 plants now operating in this country.
   The chief danger is that a quake would cause a crack in the
piping that carries cooling water to the reactor core. A rapid loss
of coolant could cause the fuel rods in the core to melt, possibly
allowing radioactive material to escape into the atmosphere.

   An upset member of a crew inspecting the
crumpled Interstate 880 drove a truck off the edge of the highway
late Thursday, officials said. The truck fell 30 feet.
   The driver was taken to Highland Hospital in Oakland, officials
said. No condition was immediately available, but a police officer
said the driver had serious injuries.
   The crew member worked for the California Department of
Transportation, and was working near the section of freeway that
buckled and trapped an undetermined number of drivers inside in
Tuesday's earthquake, according to Lisa Murphy, a department
spokeswoman. The quake registered a 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   The driver was ``upset over something, but I don't know what,''
said Sgt. John Silva. He said the driver expressed anger to the
last person he spoke with before he left the scene.
   The accident occurred at 10:30 p.m. at the northern end of the
twisted section of freeway.

   President Bush has never told his wife what, or
what not, to say, the first lady declared.
   And, she warned, ``He'd better not.''
   Barbara Bush said what she chose to some 1,350 members of New
York's elite at the 44th annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner
Thursday.
   Mrs. Bush, who joined a long line of prominent people who have
addressed the Al Smith charity, said she welcomed the chance ``to
prove I'm more than just a pretty face.''
   She began her speech by contradicting a published report that
said she weighs 135-140 pounds.
   ``George said the press never gets anything right,'' she said.
``I was born weighing 135 pounds.''
   Pausing briefly, she turned to outgoing Mayor Edward I. Koch,
who was also on the dais, and handed him his own favorite line.
   ``How'm I doin', Ed?'' she asked.
   The guests paid $500 a plate to dine on filet mignon and
chocolate hazelnut torte. Proceeds from the dinner, sponsored by
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, go to health-care
causes.
   At last year's dinner, then Vice President George Bush and his
presidential opponent, Democrat Michael S. Dukakis, traded jokes
just weeks before Bush won the race for the White House.
   ``I loved `The Bonfire of the Vanities,''' Mrs. Bush told this
year's glittering gathering, referring to Tom Wolfe's satirical
look at New York politics and race relations.
   ``But I never dreamed I'd get to address some of the characters
in person,'' she added, to laughter and applause.
   Thursday night found the increasingly combative top contenders
for City Hall, Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph
Giuliani, sitting two seats apart on the dais. Gov. Mario Cuomo
also attended.
   Governor of New York from 1923 to 1928, Smith in 1928 became the
first Catholic to be nominated for president. The first memorial
dinner was held in 1945, a year after his death.
   Keynote speakers have included the first Catholic elected
president, John F. Kennedy; former presidents Richard M. Nixon,
Dwight D. Eisenhower; Lyndon B. Johnson; comedians Danny Thomas and
Bob Hope; and Winston S. Churchill.
   Earlier Thursday, Mrs. Bush read to Big Bird and his friends
during a taping of ``Sesame Street,'' the award-winning Public
Broadcasting Service television show. The first lady frequently
makes public appearances to promote literacy.

<HEAD>Virginia Gubernatorial Candidates Spar Over Civil Rights Leader</HEAD>

   A man seeking to become the nation's first
elected black governor was sharply critical of his opponent for
invoking the name of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr. in a televised debate.
   Republican J. Marshall Coleman, a former state attorney general,
twice referred to King Thursday in defending his commitment to
affirmative action.
   ``What we want is a society that is open to everyone, regardless
of color,'' said Coleman, who said he worked as a University of
Virginia student to get Charlottesville restaurants to desegregate.
   Coleman said he supported King's view that people should be
judged on their character and not their skin color.
   But Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, the state's lieutenant governor,
said it was ``almost despicable' that Coleman linked himself to
King.
   Wilder responded angrily that the late Gov. John N. Dalton cast
a veto ``that you encouraged'' of a bill creating a state holiday
to honor King.
   The hourlong debate was the candidates' final televised debate
before the Nov. 7 election.
   Coleman focused on taxes during the debate. ``What I want to do
is hold the line on taxes,'' Coleman said. ``As a Democrat, he can
be expected to raise taxes.''
   But Wilder said he has fought repeatedly to repeal the sales tax
on food and non-prescription drugs as well as for the pension tax
relief.
   Coleman also charged Wilder with switching from anti-death
penalty to a pro-capital punishment stand and with once supporting
collective bargaining for public employees.
   The issue that dominated the first debate, abortion, hardly was
mentioned by the candidates.
   Wilder made a reference in his closing remarks about not
returning to government interference in the private lives of its
citizens and at another point said Coleman promised his
anti-abortion supporters their views would be represented in
appointments to state offices.
   The debate coincided with the release of a new poll showing
Wilder and Coleman virtually in a dead heat. The Mason-Dixon
Opinion Research Inc. poll showed 45 percent for Wilder to 43
percent for Coleman. The poll's margin of error was 3{ percentage
points either way.
   Since the last Mason-Dixon poll on Sept. 20, Wilder has gained 8
points and Coleman has dropped 1 point.
   The current governor, Democrat Gerald L. Baliles, is barred by
the state Constitution from seeking a second consecutive term.

<HEAD>Is Freddy Krueger Doll Being Buried in Toy Graveyard?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Many people hoping to buy the Freddy Krueger
doll, based on the ghoulish character in ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' movies, may be able to purchase it only in their dreams.
   The Rev. Donald Wildmon, whose American Family Association had
urged a boycott of the doll, announced Thursday that the Matchbox
toy company informed him it would not proceed with plans to market
the doll.
   ``We feel that the decision by Matchbox is a very positive and
socially responsible one, and we commend them for their decision,''
Wildmon said in disclosing the toy company's action.
   Matchbox, better known for tiny toy cars, confirmed that it
decided to drop its plans _ at least temporarily _ for marketing a
doll version of the movie fiend who has blades for fingernails and
kills his victims in their dreams.
   ``Matchbox will not advertise or promote the doll in any way,''
said a spokeswoman for Matchbox Toys (USA) Ltd.
   The doll, announced last month, had been expected to be a hot
seller ahead of Halloween.
   But Matchbox has not decided on the doll's ultimate fate.
   ``As far as 1990 goes, I don't think any decision has been
made,'' said the spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Wildmon said he was told by Matchbox that about 40,000 dolls
already being shipped will not be halted. But orders for another
160,000 dolls will not be filled.
   The Matchbox spokeswoman could not confirm the figures, but said
orders for the doll significantly exceed the number of dolls
already assembled.
   Wildmon's American Family Association, which has backed boycotts
of TV programs it considers offensive, had called for a boycott of
the Freddy Krueger doll immediately after it was announced last
month.
   Wildmon had called the Freddy Krueger doll ``a product of a sick
mind.''
   The Tupelo, Miss.-based group also had urged a boycott of stores
that stocked the doll and a boycott of all other toys made by
Matchbox.

   Three ministers called to testify
against a man who confessed during a church service to robbing his
uncle's store are claiming that requirement would violate their
right to freedom of religion.
   ``We're not in the business of putting people in jail. We're in
the business of repenting them,'' Shirley Hiles, one of the
ministers at the Word of Deliverance Church, said Thursday.
   Morgan County Judge Thomas Steptoe Jr. on Monday refused to
quash a subpoena for Mrs. Hiles, 50; her husband, Jack Hiles, 50;
and Wilda Maconaughay, 54.
   They were subpoenaed to testify in the trial of Larry Yost, who
is charged with breaking and entering. Steptoe postponed the trial
until Dec. 5 to give the ministers time to appeal.
   At an evening service during Christmas week last year, Yost
stood up before 45 members of the congregation and said he had
broken into his uncle's store. Yost was arrested in January and has
been in jail since on $25,000 bail.
   Yost allegedly stole $3,700 worth of material from Yost Building
Supply Inc.
   The ministers, whose church advocates the public confession of
sins, said their jail ministry program has been hurt because
inmates are afraid that what they say will be used against them.
   ``This will stop the function of our church,'' Mrs. Hiles said.
``We might as well close the doors because people won't be able to
be born again.''
   ``I've heard many public confessions from all kinds of good
people who have repented,'' her husband said. ``A lot of them could
have been dragged into court, but they became good people again,
valuable people.''
   If convicted, Yost could be sentenced to life in prison without
parole under the state's repeat offender law because he has two
previous convictions.
   In 1986, Yost and two other inmates broke out of the Morgan
County Jail, broke into a bar across the street and stole a keg of
beer, which they carried back to their cells and had a party.

   A study by black researchers into the plight of
black Americans provides more insight and policy recommendations
than a far more expensive report conducted mostly by whites, says a
sponsor of the new study.
   ``Historically, blacks have been treated as objects of study,
rather than as major participants in conducting a study,'' said
Wornie Reed, director of the William Monroe Trotter Institute for
the Study of Black Culture at the University of Massachusetts at
Boston.
   ``Many studies say black people are unemployed,'' he said. ``We
looked at why they're unemployed.''
   The study, a summary volume of which was released Thursday, was
commissioned by the Trotter Institute and cost about $100,000.
   ``Race continues to matter,'' according to the report.
``Discrimination persists, although its forms have altered.''
   The study, titled ``Assessment of the Status of
African-Americans,'' was conducted by academics around the country
in response to another, controversial study of blacks by the
National Research Council released last summer that was conducted
mostly by whites at a cost of $2 million.
   That study, called ``A Common Destiny: Blacks and American
Society,'' found that blacks made great strides in the last 50
years but were losing ground in such areas as economic and
educational status. At the time the National Research Council study
was announced in 1984, some black scholars protested their omission
from the study.
   Reed acknowledged Thursday that the basic findings of the
Trotter study did not differ greatly from the previous report. He
said he believes some of the protests by black scholars may have
contributed to the ``fairness'' of the National Research Council
study. But he said the Trotter report questioned how society
contributes to the status of blacks today.
   ``They talked about cultural poverty but we go even further to
explain why there is such a problem and make policy
recommendations,'' said Reed.
   The Trotter report calls for more federal assistance to black
students, strengthening black families and stimulating economic
growth, expanding child care and other federal aid programs, bail
reform, cultural sensitivity training for judges and others in the
criminal justice system and recruiting more blacks for the health
professions.
   The report found that racial discrimination impedes blacks'
access to health care, higher education and jobs and is present in
the criminal justice system.
   Among the specific findings:
   _ During 1985 and 1986, life expectancy for blacks dropped, the
first consecutive decline this century. The average life expectancy
for blacks dropped to 69.4 years in 1986, while whites increased to
an all-time high of 75 years.
   _ In 1984, the average black family had a net worth of $3,400,
compared with $39,000 for a white family.
   _ Minority youths are imprisoned three to four times more than
white youths and receive stiffer sentences.

   A Liszt piano variation linked to misfortune
and death for more than 150 years was presented by a set of twins _
this time, without a hitch.
   The 800-member audience rose to its feet Thursday night to
applaud the performance by John and Richard Contiguglia of Franz
Liszt's ``Great Concert Piece on Mendelssohn's `Songs Without
Words.''' The 52-year-old twins are credited with discovering the
piece in 1973.
   Liszt, the Hungarian composer, wrote the variation on
Mendelssohn's music in 1835. He collapsed at the keyboard during
the premiere of the piece that year.
   The Contiguglias, who hail from this central New York town but
live in New York City, were scheduled to play the music Saturday
night, but the concert was canceled when a violent thunderstorm
plunged the East Middle School auditorium into darkness.
   Pianist Ferrucio Busone died shortly before a performance of the
piece in 1924.
   In 1986, the Contiguglia brothers planned to perform it at a
Liszt festival in Holland, but the Dutch government seized the
sheet music, claiming it held a coded spy message being passed from
East Germany to the West.
   ``It's uncanny how many times something has prevented this song
from being played,'' Richard Contiguglia said.

   The physical aftershocks that followed
Northern California's monster quake haven't let up, and authorities
say the psychological shockwaves are just beginning.
   ``We are getting people who are starting to call in now with
some of the things we expected to have follow this earthquake,''
Eve Myer, executive director of the San Francisco Suicide
Prevention Hotline, said Thursday.
   ``We're seeing the depression that sets in after the adrenalin
dies down and when the television stories (about the quake) start
to repeat themselves.''
   The usual load of 200 calls a day is up at least 10 percent
since the quake, Myer said. The ``first wave'' of callers,
generally elderly people who felt particularly vulnerable, is
giving way to a second group that seems exceptionally confused by
overpowering feelings of sadness and gloom, she said.
   Many callers are reporting trouble sleeping, sensing the
incredible fright caused by the temblor all over again, and they
appear to be linking the earthquake to other traumatic events in
their lives and intensifying their discomfort, she said.
   Myer said she understands how they feel.
   When she couldn't find her husband immediately after Tuesday's
earthquake, she felt tension and frustration. She said she later
realized she had unconsciously associated the events with her
mother's unsuccessful search for her husband in Nazi Germany.
   ``That old story bubbled up in my head and I didn't realize I
was reliving a war I had never been in ... and that's happening to
other people, too,'' she said. ``This will happen more and more.
That's a fairly natural thing.''
   That's one reason the city is sending special mental health
teams to help some of the newly set-up homeless shelters.
   ``It's like the rug is pulled out from under you _ the firm
stance you have in the world gets shaken,'' said psychologist
Daniel Weiss of Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute at the
University of California, San Francisco.
   ``It forces you to confront your own mortality: that you don't
live forever, that bad things happen to good people _ sometimes for
no reason at all,'' Weiss said Thursday.
   Dr. Lenore Terr, a San Francisco psychiatrist, said area
residents expect earthquakes, so it may not be as traumatizing as
other disasters.
   But for those who are severely distressed, symptoms include
jumpiness, irritability, nightmares, emotional numbness and
detachment, recurrent images of disaster, difficulty concentrating
and sleeping, and fear of entering buildings or double-deck
freeways like the one in Oakland that collapsed.
   People who survived unscathed often display disbelief of
surrounding destruction, followed by relief, then guilt that they
lived while others died, Weiss said. For those who had relatives
die or homes destroyed, ``questions arise like `Why me? What did I
do to deserve this?'
   ``There is no one to get angry at, and sometimes feelings of
anger at having been victimized are put onto other innocent
people.''
   Children are vulnerable, too.
   Those younger than age 3 ``may be a little bit more anxious, a
little more clingy. If their parents are upset, their children will
be upset,'' said Dr. Glen Elliott, director of child and adult
psychiatry at Langley Porter.
   Some help has come from computer communication systems.
   Prodigy, a White Plains, N.Y.-based venture of IBM and Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co., had a system going less than four hours after
Tuesday's quake, said Brian Ek, communications manager.
   It also put a psychologist on line Wednesday night ``to help
these people deal with the trauma. We had one person who know some
of the people involved in the Nimitz Highway situation who was
pretty distraught,'' Ek said. By Thursday afternoon, 1,530 messages
were posted.
   CompuServe, the Columbus, Ohio, based computer information
service, with 550,000 individual and 1,800 corporate customers
worldwide, has created an ``earthquake forum'' where people
concerned about what's happening to loved ones and friends in the
wake of the quake can leave messages and information.

<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inner-city grocery store is asking
shoppers to pay a quarter deposit to be part of its carriage trade.
   Hoping to keep shopping carts where they belong, Waldbaum's on
Main Street has been testing the deposit system since Tuesday. The
cart handles have been fitted with a locking mechanism with a key
on a heavy chain that connects to the lock on the next cart in line.
   Shoppers must slip a quarter into the lock to release their
cart. When they return the cart and fit the key from its
neighboring cart back in again, a quarter pops back out.
   Store manager Bob Foote said the lockup system is widely used in
Canada.
   ``Being an inner-city store, we've got quite a problem with
losing carriages,'' Foote said. ``I'd estimate that last year we
spent $25,000 on them. We spend maybe 60 hours a week, at $5 or $6
an hour, just shagging the lot for carriages.''
   In addition, Waldbaum's pays a woman with a pickup truck $100 a
week to scout out wayward carts.
   Though a 25-cent deposit will not stop a determined thief, Foote
said he hopes it will encourage young people in particular to bring
back any stray carts they find.
   Not all customers have been as receptive to the deposits as the
store manager.
   ``It's a hassle getting a quarter,'' Sheryl McGee said Thursday.
``You might not have one.''

<HEAD>Jamie Fiske Discharged; Cause of Bleeding Still Uncertain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old girl whose need for a new liver
as an infant helped spur the nation's organ transplant policy has
been discharged from the University of Minnesota Hospital.
   She left Thursday afternoon, though doctors remained unsure what
caused a bout of internal bleeding. She will stay in the area with
her parents at least until the middle of next week, hospital
spokeswoman Mary Stanik said.
   Doctors on Oct. 9 removed the youngster's enlarged spleen in the
belief that it had caused three bouts of internal bleeding within a
month. She was discharged on Saturday, but was readmitted the
following day when she suffered more bleeding several hours after
leaving the hospital.
   Stanik said Jamie has had no more bleeding since re-entering the
hospital.
   Jamie was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition
in which the liver's bile ducts are blocked.
   She received a liver at the University of Minnesota in 1982 a
few days after her father, Charles Fiske, made a televised appeal
for a donor during a convention at the American Academy of
Pediatricians.
   Doctors during the spleen removal surgery were able to examine
Jamie's liver, and said it and her other organs were normal. Stanik
said doctors do not think the liver has anything to do with the
girl's current problems.
   Stanik said Jamie's spirits are good, although she still hopes
to return to her Bridgewater, Mass., home in time for Halloween.
   ``She seems to be handling things quite well,'' Stanik said.

   A state grand jury has subpoenaed witnesses in
Arizona and other states in a new investigation into the 1976
car-bomb slaying of investigative reporter Don Bolles, sources said.
   Among those subpoenaed, sources familiar with the investigation
told The Associated Press on Thursday, was Phoenix attorney Neal
Roberts, a figure in the original Bolles investigation.
   The sources demanded anonymity, saying they feared prosecution
under an Arizona law making it a crime to disclose grand jury
matters.
   Roberts, 60, did not return a call from the AP but was quoted in
today's editions of The Arizona Republic as confirming that he had
been served with the subpoena by aides to Attorney General Bob
Corbin.
   The newspaper said Ben Funk, a St. Louis hotel clerk and member
of a racing family that had clashed with Bolles, also confirmed he
had been subpoenaed.
   Corbin, who has been coming under pressure over the Bolles
murder, declined comment on the grand jury probe but confirmed that
his office had been working on the Bolles case for more than a year.
   Bolles, an investigative reporter for the Republic, was murdered
by a remote-controlled car bomb. The man convicted of planting the
bomb, racing dog owner John Harvey Adamson, is in prison, but no
mastermind has ever been convicted.
   Roberts arranged for Adamson to fly to Lake Havasu City a few
hours after the bombing. He was granted limited immunity in 1976
provided that he was not involved in planning or carrying out the
slaying and that he told all he knew about it.
   Bolles died 11 days after the June 1976 explosion. Before his
death he repeatedly said the word ``Emprise,'' an apparent
reference to a company later called Delaware North that was
partners with the Funk family in Arizona dog-racing interests.

<HEAD>Medellin Drug Cartel Suspects Captured In Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local Mexican officials may have given
protection to two Colombian drug-runners linked to the Medellin
cocaine cartel and arrested in the southern Yucatan, federal police
say.
   Federal officials on Thursday announced their capture of the
nephews of two major Colombian drug kingpins, saying they had
broken up a ring that flew cocaine into Mexico and shipped it by
boat to Florida.
   The Colombians and eight other men were captured Sunday at a
clandestine airstrip in the Yucatan peninsula, said federal police
commander Fausto Valverde, head of the narcotics interdiction
forces.
   ``We imagine they made an arrangement for protection,'' Valverde
said. He said police were investigating the matter.
   Two other men were captured in the resort city of Cancun,
Valverde said.
   Authorities said they waited to announce the arrests because
they had hoped to capture more accomplices. They said they were
searching for another Colombian suspect.
   Valverde also said that an airplane carrying drugs to Cancun
escaped when someone on the ground warned it by radio that Mexican
police were at the clandestine airstrip.
   Captured were ringleaders Luis Alfredo Aguilar Castro, a nephew
of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, and Ricardo Isunza Ochoa, a nephew of
Fabio Ochoa, according to Valverde.
   Fabio Ochoa and Rodriguez Gacha, known as ``El Mexicano''
because of his interest in Mexican culture, are top members of the
Medellin cartel and are among the world's most-wanted drug
traffickers.
   Valverde said Aguilar and Isunza Ochoa were their uncles' direct
representatives in the smuggling operation.
   He said he did not know whether the two were wanted in Colombia
or the United States on drug-related charges. Asked whether the two
might be extradited to the United States, Valverde answered,
``Anything is possible.''
   Commander Miguel Rodriguez Lorrabaquio said the group brought
cocaine from Colombia by air to Mexico, then shipped it by boat to
the United States, usually to Florida.
   Colombia's Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels account for an
estimated 80 percent of cocaine shipped to the United States.
   Traffickers in that South American country have operated with
relative impunity over the years by intimidating or paying off
judges.
   But on Aug. 19 the Colombian government declared war against
cocaine barons after traffickers assassinated the country's leading
presidential candidate. That included seizing the property of
alleged traffickers and reinstating an extradition treaty with the
United States.
   In response, cocaine barons began a bombing and terror campaign
in Colombia.

<HEAD>Beijing Plans Strict Punishment For Prostitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be
built to house prostitutes and severe punishment, including the
death sentence, for anyone who induces or coerces women into
prostitution.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said today the municipal
government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its
first anti-prostitution statutes.
   It quoted Liu Changyi, deputy director of the Beijing Public
Security Bureau, as saying prostitution had re-emerged in the city
and evolved fairly quickly since the early 1980s.
   Liu gave no figures except to say there were many more people
involved in prostitution now than in 1985, when there were about
100 cases.
   He that only four cases of syphilis and other sexually
transmitted diseases were discovered in 1984, compared to about
1,000 last year.
   The draft regulations call for the city to set up a penitentiary
for those involved in prostitution and enforce strict punishment,
including the death sentence, for procurers.
   Foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according
to the law, and those with sexually transmitted diseases expelled
from the country, according to the regulations.
   The Communist government nearly succeeded in eliminating
prostitution after taking over in 1949, but the practice has
returned in recent years with the country's increased exposure to
the outside world.
   Prostitution has made its strongest comeback in Canton and other
cities of southern China that are influenced by neighboring Hong
Kong. Two Canton men were executed in 1987 for running a
prostitution ring.
   China has national laws against prostitution, but penalties are
generally light. According to a 1986 law, women caught selling
sexual favors are detained for less than 15 days or, in more
serious cases, sent to labor reform camps.

<TEXT>
   Residents camped out today in this
earthquake-stricken beach town as workers faced repair jobs on
hundreds of damaged buildings and on a ruptured sewer line that
leaked effluent into Monterey Bay.
   Six people were killed following Tuesday's quake and the Santa
Cruz County emergency services office estimated 10,000 of the
county's 229,000 residents were displaced.
   One of the dead was Robin Ortiz, whose body was found Thursday
in the rubble of Santa Cruz Coffee Roasting Co. Thirty people had
kept a vigil since Tuesday's quake. Five were arrested late
Wednesday when they broke through a barricade after learning rescue
efforts were suspended for the night, police said.
   County officials estimated that Santa Cruz, on the north end of
Monterey Bay 90 miles south of San Francisco, sustained $350
million damage and unincorporated county areas sustained $400
million damage.
   President Bush was scheduled to make an inspection tour today.
   Many of the newly homeless lived in the 250 homes destroyed
Tuesday and the rest were ``people afraid to go in their houses,
who don't have any water or don't have any electricity,'' said
county spokeswoman Dinah Phillips.
   Power was restored to all but 3,600 customers in the county and
water was fit to drink in the city of Santa Cruz, population
50,000, and in much of the county by Thursday night, officials said.
   Aftershocks also caused problems. A 4.3 magnitude aftershock
triggered a landslide on Highway 17 Thursday afternoon,
guaranteeing that the primary route north to San Jose would remain
closed for another three weeks, a county spokeswoman said.
   The tremor also rocked a civic center shelter in downtown Santa
Cruz where nearly 200 people have been housed and some 3,000 fed
each day since the quake. Many others have been camping out.
   In the city, major damage occurred in the Pacific Garden Mall
business district and a residential area near marshy Neary Lagoon
where about 40 homes were destroyed. Communities to the north and
south also were damaged.
   Gov. George Deukmejian on Thursday surveyed damage to the
Pacific Garden Mall and promised local officials state aid.
   An estimated 30 percent of the businesses along the Pacific
Garden Mall will have to be razed. Unreinforced masonry structures
along an entire block of downtown Watsonville also must come down.
   Elsewhere, an unknown volume of sewage continued to leak into
Monterey Bay from ruptures in a county sewer line, closing beaches
in Santa Cruz.
   Authorities also continued to evacuate residents whose homes
were threatened by landslides or destroyed by the quake near
Boulder Creek and the Blue Ridge area in mountains north of Santa
Cruz.
   Despite the widespread damage, residents began resuming routine
as businesses slowly continued to reopen, mostly on a limited basis.
   Business owners said it would be at least several days until
they could start getting reliable shipments over roads leading into
Santa Cruz, many of which were entirely or partially closed.
   Outside a shelter for the homeless, though, pictures drawn by
children showed some youngsters had hope for the future.
Ten-year-old Amanda Charnas of Santa Cruz drew the Earth, flowers
sprouting from a crack and a rainbow nearby.
   ``Because that's what I think it will look like when the cracks
are gone, I think there will be rainbows,'' Amanda said.

<HEAD>Victim Says Angelo Told Him Injection Would Make Him Better</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nurse charged with poisoning at least
seven patients, four of them fatally, told one, ``This will make
you feel much better,'' before slipping him a paralyzing injection,
said the patient who survived.
   ``I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe,'' 75-year-old Gerolamo
Kucich testified Thursday. ``I was thinking, how long is it going
to last before I die?''
   Kucich was the first witness in the opening day of the murder
trial of Richard Angelo, 27.
   Angelo is charged with four counts of second-degree murder and
three counts of assault for allegedly administering lethal doses of
Pavulon, a muscle relaxant, to patients at Good Samaritan Hospital
in 1987. He worked at the hospital in the Long Island town of West
Islip for six months as a nurse.
   Prosecutor John Colins called Angelo ``a monster dressed in
nurse's whites'' and ``the living embodiment of your worst
nightmare.''
   Colins said Angelo first experimented on mice and then moved on
to ``terribly vulnerable human beings for his stated purposes of
improving his image and reputation.''
   Police say Angelo admitted in written and videotaped confessions
that he gave the injections to patients with the intention of
reviving them so he would look like a hero.
   Kucich testified that a bearded man in a white medical coat came
into his hospital room one day and asked him how he was feeling.
   The former patient said that when he responded, ``Not bad,'' the
man opened his coat, took out a needle and told him, ``This will
make you feel much better.''
   Angelo then injected the drug into his intravenous tube and left
the room, said Kucich.
   ``I became like dead,'' said Kucich.
   He managed to press the emergency alarm and his regular nurse,
Lauren Ball, came in and helped revive him.
   Kucich said he still couldn't talk or see moments later when he
heard Angelo return to the room. He gestured towards Angelo's
voice, hoping Mrs. Ball would catch on.
   According to Kucich, Mrs. Ball asked Angelo, ``What did you do?''
   Kucich said Angelo answered, ``Nothing,'' and left the room.
   Mrs. Ball was scheduled to testify today when the trial resumes.
   As Kucich spoke, Angelo sat at the defense table with his eyes
downcast. His parents, Alice and Joseph Angelo, retired
schoolteachers who recently moved to Florida, sat behind him.
   Kucich of Yugoslavia was visiting his children when he was
hospitalized for a heart attack in 1987. He returned for the trial.
   Twenty-two patients' bodies were exhumed during the
investigation. Pavulon poisoning was found in six bodies but could
be established as a cause of death in only four. The other two
cases resulted in assault charges against Angelo. The third assault
charge is for the attack on Kucich, the only known survivor.
   Angelo's attorney, Eric Naiburg, admitted that Angelo gave the
injections but he asked the jury to consider a lesser charge than
second-degree murder.

<HEAD>$1.3 Million Lotto Ticket Found in Cookie Jar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newton Hazell looked on his dresser, in his desk
drawers and under his mattress before he remembered the cookie jar
_ which was where he'd unknowingly stuffed a $1.3 million winning
Lotto ticket last year.
   ``I just stuck it in and forgot all about it,'' said Hazell, who
overcame the memory lapse to become a millionaire just four days
before his ticket would have become worthless.
   Hazell, a correction officer, showed up Wednesday at the lottery
offices to collect his prize from the Oct. 22, 1988, drawing.
   ``Isn't that something? This was down to the nitty-gritty.
Another week and I would have lost it,'' said Hazell, of Metuchen,
N.J., after a Thursday news conference announcing his sweet find.
   Hazell, 58, bought the winning ticket at the Towne and Country
Deli on New York City's Staten Island, selecting the numbers 7, 9,
13, 21, 34 and 43. But he dumped the ticket into the cookie jar and
never checked to see if he won.
   Last week, Hazell noticed a sign in the deli telling Lotto
players to check their tickets because a $1.3 million prize was
still unclaimed. A newspaper article pinned next to it showed the
missing ticket contained his weekly numbers.
   ``I looked everywhere, because I saw my numbers. I went through
dressers, drawers, under the mattress. I went through a bag where I
throw all my losing tickets,'' said Hazell.
   Finally, he had a feeling about the cookie jar and went to check
it out: ``There it was, all by itself.'' Winners have one year to
produce their tickets; Hazell showed up with just four days to
spare.
   State lottery spokesman Bill Knowlton said this was the longest
anybody had ever waited to claim a prize. Two other people picked
winning numbers in the drawing, and both had already claimed their
shares of the $4 million jackpot.
   Hazell _ whose winning numbers combined his birthday,
anniversary, daughter's age and license plate number _ said the
windfall won't have any immediate effect on his lifestyle.
   ``I'm not going to retire. I'm a young 58, going on 25,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Fatal Shooting Leads to Charge Against Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors charged a 12-year-old boy with
manslaughter in the shotgun slaying of his 7-year-old sister,
although they said the shooting was an accident.
   Prosecutor Danny Dawson said the boy, Marvin Williams, was
grossly negligent in deliberately aiming a short-barreled shotgun
that killed Calandra Graham.
   ``If at the time a gun goes off you've got control of the gun
and you're pointing it at another individual, that crosses the
threshold of culpable negligence,'' said Dawson.
   Marvin's mother, Mattie Williams, said when told of the charge
Wednesday: ``I don't understand it. But we will deal with it. We
will deal with it.''
   The two children were alone at home at the time of the Sept. 13
shooting, and the boy told investigators conflicting stories of
what happened, said state attorney's spokesman Randy Means.
   Investigators later determined that Marvin took the gun from an
unlocked cabinet in his 18-year-old brother's bedroom and played
with it for a few minutes around the house before returning to the
bedroom to put it away.
   When he saw his sister, Means said the boy pointed the gun and
told her ``something to the effect of `Don't worry, it's not
dangerous.'''
   The gun then went off, blasting the girl in the face.
   Means said the boy's conduct was so careless that it rises to
the level of culpable negligence, the standard used to prove
manslaughter.
   In a similar case in Orlando in June, 10-year-old Scott Feltner
was shot and killed by 13-year-old Barry McDonald, who was not
charged. But McDonald was not paying attention to where he was
aiming the gun when it went off, Dawson said.
   Means said prosecutors have not decided whether to charge Marvin
Williams' 18-year-old brother, Efrem Bolden, with illegal
possession of the shotgun used in the girl's death. A state law
which took effect in October penalizes the owner of a weapon left
where it can be easily obtained by children.

<HEAD>Oakland Suffered $1.3 Billion Damage: Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collapsed freeway has drawn most of the
attention in the earthquake's aftermath, but the temblor also
caused $1.3 billion worth of damage elsewhere in the city,
according to Mayor Lionel Wilson.
   Among the buildings found uninhabitable was City Hall, an ornate
structure built in 1911. Crucial city services have been relocated.
   The building's historic value makes it an obvious candidate for
repair, according to Linda Schroff, emergency services coordinator
for the city.
   ``But it's difficult to assess at this point whether they could
repair it to the point where it was real safe or they would have to
take it down,'' she said. ``Depending on the assistance we get from
the federal government, they will or will not make it a safe place
to be.''
   The historic Amtrak railroad station in West Oakland may have to
be torn down after the discovery of three big cracks running
through the structure, officials said.
   ``One more good shake and the whole thing would have come
down,'' said Amtrak employee Ron Young.
   Some city staff members, including the city manager's office,
have moved operations from City Hall to the Fire Department.
   The section of Interstate 880 that buckled in Tuesday's
earthquake trapped an undetermined number of drivers inside. Rescue
workers continued efforts around the clock in hope of finding
survivors.
   Elsewhere in the city, workers inspected damaged buildings.
Hard-hit was the downtown area. The earthquake caused enough damage
to require the replacement of 1,400 residential units worth $29.4
million, Schroff said. More than 100 elderly people whose homes
were destroyed have gone to shelters, she said.
   Thirteen commercial buildings worth $234 million must be
replaced and 200 buildings suffered damages totaling another $750
million. A dozen public buildings, including City Hall, suffered
$250 million in damages.
   Modern buildings suffered along with the old, including one
structure under construction as part of the City Center project.
Girders at the top of 14 stories of framework were askew and part
of a fallen construction elevator lay crumpled on the ground.
   ``I certainly didn't expect we would have that much damage with
a 7.0 earthquake. It's shocking and upsetting,'' said Oakland City
Council member Dick Spees.
   City government should be fully operational within four or five
days but it will take months before the city is back to normal, he
said.
   The Oakland Museum sustained ``quite a bit of damage to
artifacts and early California exhibits in the history wing,''
according to museum spokesman Phil Mumma.
   Along Broadway, the heart of downtown, most of the broken glass
has been swept from the sidewalks, but police tape and temporary
cyclone fences kept people away from damaged buildings where bricks
and windows had fallen.
   David Johnson, an assistant to the mayor, said the earthquake
will not hurt the momentum of the city's revitalization effort.
   ``It may slow us down a little, but only a little,'' he said.

<HEAD>CBS's `48 Hours' Has Telling Finale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Rather thought the ``48 Hours''
earthquake broadcast was going well enough. Then a disturbance
broke out off-camera, interrupting the live show.
   Designed to report the news both quickly and with a personal
spin, ``48 Hours'' was handed a perfect finale Thursday: Just a few
feet from the CBS cameras, the father of a man believed killed on
collapsed Interstate 880 was accusing the Oakland mayor of
negligent homicide.
   ``It was a telling moment,'' anchorman Rather said in an
interview after the show. ``It said a lot about fears and
frustrations and what happens to people in situations like this.
   ``When you talk about earthquake victims, you have to remember
that's one person at a time. What gets drowned out in a lot of
newscasts on a story like this is the story of one person. One
person like Mr. Rubi's son, up there in the wreckage.
   ``That's something I and a lot of other people can relate to.''
   Daniel Rubi assailed Mayor Lionel Wilson during an evening news
conference in front of Interstate 880, saying that Wilson ``was
directly responsible for my son's death.'' Rubi said his son Juan,
28, was killed because Wilson had failed to maintain the freeway.
The younger Rubi's body is not among those recovered from the
wreckage so far.
   The elder Rubi, profiled on ``48 Hours'' shortly before his
outburst, was taken from the scene in a police squad car but not
arrested, authorities said.
   For the weekly news magazine, the Rubi incident was an
unfortunate but nevertheless valuable break. Like the other
networks and media organizations swarming around the Bay area, CBS
News has labored to find fresh ways to tell a complex story.
   ``The first problem you have is getting on the air in the first
place,'' said Don DeCesare, vice president of news coverage for
CBS. He cited an array of logistical problems, from no telephones
to no on-site editing bays and a shortage of mobile broadcast
facilities.
   One danger of incorporating journalists themselves in the news
accounts and importing high-ticket anchors like Rather, NBC's Tom
Brokaw and ABC's Peter Jennings is that they can become as much a
part of the story as the story itself.
   Andrew Heyward, the executive producer of ``48 Hours,'' said the
arrival of the network stars was only a reflection of the story's
importance.
   ``There is an advantage for the anchor to be in the city _ it's
certainly better than in the studio,'' Heyward said.
   Yet when ABC's Jennings arrived at the scene, just the opposite
was true.
   Jennings pulled into the destroyed freeway scene on Wednesday
morning and, minutes later, delivered a live dispatch that
demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly and
accurately.
   Jennings said rescue workers had labored through the night to
save lives on the collapsed freeway.
   Anyone who had spent the early-morning hours there, however,
would have said very little happened after midnight.

   A ferry boat armada is being prepared as
transit officials brace for a monumental traffic jam on San
Francisco Bay area freeways Monday when most workers return to
their jobs in the quake-ravaged region.
   Some roads already have been gripped by gridlock despite fewer
commuters in the aftermath of Tuesday's quake, which shut down the
vital bridge linking San Francisco to Oakland and the rest of the
East Bay.
   Ferry boats may relieve some of the pressure on the highways.
   ``We've got three days to get ready for Monday with as much of
an armada as possible,'' state Sen. Quentin Kopp said at an
emergency meeting of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission on
Thursday.
   ``I don't see much alternative to water over the next couple of
weeks,'' while the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is repaired,
Kopp said. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed during the
quake and could take up to two months to repair.
   Kopp said some 45 vessels, ranging from elegant dining cruise
boats to Navy landing craft, could be pressed into service to carry
up to 60,000 commuters across the waters. Kopp said 20 Navy boats
were made available by the 12th Naval District.
   But that still leaves at least 50,000 additional commuters who
normally take the bridge.
   ``It'll get bad Monday,'' said George Gray, deputy district
director for public transportation at the California Department of
Transportation.
   He encouraged people to stay home and work through personal
computers or to adopt flexible work hours.
   On Thursday, about 60 percent of the usual number of commuters
struggled to reach work by train, boat or car. Many found
themselves in traffic jams. Some arrived at buildings still in the
dark or with only partial power. Others turned back after facing up
to four-hour delays on the overburdened highways.
   ``People are just trying to get back to reality, to make life
like it was before,'' said Steve Tomberlin of Traffic Central, a
private traffic information service.
   Some commuters from the East Bay took a circuitous route south
to the San Francisco Peninsula and then north to San Francisco that
added hours to the average hour-long drive they would have taken
across the Bay Bridge.
   Those who took the northern route, across the San
Rafael-Richmond Bridge to Marin County and then across the Golden
Gate Bridge, faced delays of up to 90 minutes.
   Bay Area Rapid Transit has restored full operations for the
morning commute, but it appeared that few car-lovers were switching
to the subterranean train line.
   System analyst Joan Nomara said the passenger load _ typically
about 50,000 people each way on weekdays _ was around 70 percent on
Thursday.
   BART also announced round-the-clock service would begin Monday.
The system is usually shut between midnight and 6 a.m.

   Police hauled a prominent human rights
campaigner from his Prague home before dawn today, holding him for
several hours one day after detaining 15 opposition activists in
another raid, an emigre source said.
   Jan Urban, a leading member of the Charter 77 human rights
movement and other pro-democracy groups, was taken from his home by
police at 5:30 a.m., said the source, who asked not to be
identified.
   Sources in Prague said Urban was released abouutu four hours
later after apparently being warned not to engage in further
dissident activity.
   Jiri Hajek, Czechoslovakia's foreign minister during the 1968
Prague Spring, was among those arrested Thursday and held for
several hours by police who raided a meeting the activists were
holding with international human rights campaigners. U.S. human
rights monitor Jeri Laber also was briefly detained.
   Police have made at least three other police raids on activists
over the past week.
   Czechoslovakia's Communist authorities, unlike their
counterparts in neighboring Hungary and Poland, have firmly
rejected dialogue with opposition groups who seek a more open
society.
   A wave of pro-democracy demonstrations in January has been
answered with carefully targeted harassment of leading activists
and the jailing of lesser known campaigners whose detention stirs
less protest at home and abroad.
   The current wave of harassment may be connected with the
upcoming Oct. 28 anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence in
1918.
   Last year, about 5,000 peaceful demonstrators gathered at a
banned rally to mark the anniversary and were dispersed by police
using water cannon, tear gas, dogs and batons.
   The Communist party daily Rude Pravo has already warned that
anybody attending a similar rally this year could face prosecution.

   Striking telephone workers and NYNEX Corp.
prepared to resume talks with the help of mediators aimed at ending
a 10-week-old strike.
   The first mediation meetings of the strike were to begin today,
New England Telephone announced.
   NYNEX is the parent company for New England Telephone and New
York Telephone, the companies that supply local phone service to
most consumers in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and
New Hampshire and New York.
   The mediators were selected and approved by NYNEX; the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents
most strikers in New England; and the Communications Workers of
America, which represents most striking New York Telephone
employees.
   Malcolm Read Lovell Jr., a visiting professor of government and
business at George Washington University, will act as mediator for
the communication workers union and NYNEX.
   Donald White will act as mediator for the electrical workers
union and NYNEX. White is dean of the graduate School of Arts and
Sciences at Boston College.
   Workers walked off the job Aug. 6 after contract discussions
broke down over salary and health care issues. The CWA, which
represents 40,000 workers, and the IBEW, which represents 20,000
workers, struck over NYNEX's insistence that the workers pay up to
$1,500 a year in health care costs.
   The unions and NYNEX agreed last week to bring in impartial
mediators to help settle the dispute, but had been unable to agree
until Thursday on who to pick.
   Strikes beginning Aug. 6 at three other regional phone companies
around the country _ Ameritech, Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlantic _
were all settled by the end of August.

   Victims of a series of deadly earthquakes in
rural northern China said today they owed their lives to an initial
temblor that sent them fleeing from their homes before a second
brought the dwellings crashing down.
   At least 29 people died and more than 10,000 homes were reported
destroyed by the quakes, the region's worst in 13 years.
   The official China Daily said more than 150 people were injured,
many seriously, in the quakes that hit Shanxi and Hebei provinces
late Wednesday and early Thursday.
   The temblors, centered about 135 miles west of Beijing, measured
up to 6.1 on the Richter scale and were felt in the capital.
   ``This was the worst quake we've ever had,'' Liu Rongzhen, a
peasant farmer in Xicaitian Village, told a Western reporter. ``I
was asleep in the house when the first quake woke me up. It rocked
the walls and we went outside. With the second quake the house
collapsed.''
   About half the mud and wattle homes in the impoverished dusty
town of 820 were heavily damaged. A short distance away, in Bucun,
a village of 1,280, not one home was left standing.
   People there also said the first quake, which hit with a
magnitude of 5.7 shortly before 11 p.m. Wednesday, drove them from
their homes, which toppled when the 6.1 quake hit two hours later.
   ``It was like waves,'' some in the walled village said. ``It was
very loud.''
   Two Bucun villagers, a man of about 60 and his octogenarian
mother, were killed as he carried her from the house.
   Two plain wooden caskets with straw covers were set up in their
home, which was open to the sky with the walls only partly
standing. A neighbor wailed as she viewed the caskets, at the head
of which biscuits were placed in an apparent religious offering.
   Many people spent Thursday night huddled around campfires and
sleeping in makeshift straw tents. Temperatures dipped to near
freezing on the treeless brown plain and people were wrapped in
heavy greatcoats.
   One woman was seen cleaning her now roofless home around the
tent she had set up inside.
   Today, some people rummaged through the destruction, others sat
on the rubble doing nothing.
   Residents said that in winter temperatures dip as low as 22
below zero on the exposed plain, which ranges up to 4,000 feet
above sea level. They said it would be impossible to rebuild their
homes before then.
   District officials inspected the damage, but no outside
assistance had arrived to lead relief operations.
   Raw film footage from the Shanxi provincial television, seen in
Beijing today, showed rescue workers armed only with shovels and
wooden poles digging through the rubble of destroyed homes looking
for victims.
   The film showed medical personnel treating people with badly
bloodied heads and broken bones in temporary outdoor clinics.
   People dressed in overcoats huddled around bonfires. Children
wrapped in colorful blankets slept in piles of hay.
   Most of the stricken area is populated by peasants who scrape
wheat, corn and other grain crops out of the infertile, deeply
eroded soil.
   In many places, only crumbled mud walls and the blue arched and
latticed wood doorways common to the area remained standing.
   The film showed bread and medical supplies being delivered to
damaged areas. The China Daily said 1,000 soldiers were mobilized
to help in the rescue operation.
   Officials in Datong, a major coal mining and rail center of
about 500,000 in northern Shanxi, said the city escaped serious
destruction. They said the quakes had not damaged Datong's famous
Yungang Caves which hold thousands of Buddhist paintings and
statues dating back to the 5th century.
   The first quake struck about 20 hours after the devastating
temblor in San Francisco, but seismologists said there was no
apparent link between the two.
   There were at least six quakes registering 5.0 or more on the
Richter scale and the last major aftershock, of 5.1, was recorded
at 6:29 p.m. Thursday.
   People within a radius of 300 miles felt the shocks. Residents
in Beijing scrambled from their beds, but there were no reports of
damage in the capital. State Seismological Bureau Director Fang
Zhangshun said the quakes were the strongest to hit northern China
since a calamitous 1976 quake that measured at least 7.8 on the
Richter scale and killed 240,000 people in northeastern Tangshan.
   Earthquakes are frequent in China, with more than 30 this year
above 5.0, a magnitude capable of causing damage in populated
areas. Five earthquakes, measuring up to 6.7 on the Richter scale,
hit western Sichuan in June and July, killing 11 people.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground movement as recorded by
seismographs. The open-ended scale is logarithmic, meaning that
each degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last. Thus
the 6.9 magnitude quake that hit San Francisco is 10 times stronger
than one registering 5.9 on the scale.

   A ferry boat armada is being prepared as
transit officials brace for a monumental traffic jam on San
Francisco Bay area freeways Monday when most workers return to
their jobs in the quake-ravaged region.
   Some roads already have been gripped by gridlock despite fewer
commuters in the aftermath of Tuesday's quake, which shut down the
vital bridge linking San Francisco to Oakland and the rest of the
East Bay.
   Ferry boats may relieve some of the pressure on the highways.
   ``We've got three days to get ready for Monday with as much of
an armada as possible,'' state Sen. Quentin Kopp said at an
emergency meeting of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission on
Thursday.
   ``I don't see much alternative to water over the next couple of
weeks,'' while the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is repaired,
Kopp said. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed during the
quake and could take up to two months to repair.
   Kopp said some 45 vessels, ranging from elegant dining cruise
boats to Navy landing craft, could be pressed into service to carry
up to 60,000 commuters across the waters. Kopp said 20 Navy boats
were made available by the 12th Naval District.
   But that still leaves at least 50,000 additional commuters who
normally take the bridge.
   ``It'll get bad Monday,'' said George Gray, deputy district
director for public transportation at the California Department of
Transportation.
   He encouraged people to stay home and work through personal
computers or to adopt flexible work hours.
   On Thursday, about 60 percent of the usual number of commuters
struggled to reach work by train, boat or car. Many found
themselves in traffic jams. Some arrived at buildings still in the
dark or with only partial power. Others turned back after facing up
to four-hour delays on the overburdened highways.
   ``People are just trying to get back to reality, to make life
like it was before,'' said Steve Tomberlin of Traffic Central, a
private traffic information service.
   Some commuters from the East Bay took a circuitous route south
to the San Francisco Peninsula and then north to San Francisco that
added hours to the average hour-long drive they would have taken
across the Bay Bridge.
   Those who took the northern route, across the San
Rafael-Richmond Bridge to Marin County and then across the Golden
Gate Bridge, faced delays of up to 90 minutes.
   Bay Area Rapid Transit has restored full operations for the
morning commute, but it appeared that few car-lovers were switching
to the subterranean train line.
   System analyst Joan Nomara said the passenger load _ typically
about 50,000 people each way on weekdays _ was around 70 percent on
Thursday.
   BART also announced round-the-clock service would begin Monday.
The system is usually shut between midnight and 6 a.m.

   Prices on Thursday went up $5 for ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,''
which now is the highest-priced musical of the season at $60 for
best seats.
   The musical opened at the Imperial in February with a top
admission of $55.
   The new price follows the lead last month of ``Black and Blue''
and ``Me and My Girl,'' which had raised their prices to $55. Other
Broadway musicals soon matched those prices.
   ``The Merchant of Venice,'' starring film actor Dustin Hoffman,
will charge $55 _ the highest price ever for a non-musical _ for
orchestra and front mezzanine seats when it previews Dec. 4.

<HEAD>Prisoner Avoids Gallows After Claiming He Was In Police Death Squad</HEAD>

   Three convicted murderers were
hanged today, but another received a stay of execution after
claiming he was part of a police death squad that killed a
prominent black anti-apartheid activist.
   Butana Nofemela was to be hanged at dawn at Pretoria Central
Prison along with two other blacks and a mixed-race man. But
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, after receiving an urgent request
from human rights lawyers, granted a stay of execution pending an
investigation of Nofemela's claims.
   According to lawyers, Nofemela said in an affadavit he was one
of four security policemen who killed activist Griffiths Mxenge in
1981 under orders from senior officers. Nofemela also said he was
partly responsible for the killings of eight other political
activists ordered by his superiors.
   Nofemela, 32, was convicted in 1987 of murdering a white farmer
in a case apparently without political overtones.
   Peter Mothle, a director of the Pretoria-based organization
Lawyers for Human Rights, said lawyers who studied Nofemela's
affidavit found it credible, containing accurate details related to
Mxenge's killings.
   Mxenge's body was found outside a Durban-area stadium in
November 1981. He had been stabbed more than 40 times.
   Mxenge's wife, Victoria, an attorney and activist, was killed in
August 1985. They are among several dozen anti-apartheid activists
_ black and white _ who have been killed in recent years in cases
that have never been solved.
   Many activists believe most or all of the killings were carried
out by elements of the security forces.
   After the assassination in May of David Webster, a white
activist and university lecturer, police formed a special
investigative force to probe both that killing and unsolved
bombings of offices of anti-apartheid groups. No arrests have been
made.
   Mothle said Nofemela's claims initially would be investigated by
the office of the Transvaal Province attorney general.
   ``We hope they won't turn it over to the police, but we have no
control over that,'' he said.
   The three hangings Friday raised to 45 the number of executions
so far this year. One of the prisoners was a mixed-race man
convicted of killing two residents of an retirement home.
   The other two were blacks convicted of murder during a 1986
robbery.
   Two of the men hanged this year were white, the rest black or of
mixed-race. The number of hangings so far this year is much lower
than in recent years, such as 1987, when a record 164 people were
hanged.
   The government says 60 condemned prisoners have received
reprieves this year. More than 200 prisoners, nearly all of them
black men, remain on Death Row.
   Anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa, including senior members
of the African National Congress guerrilla movement freed last
Sunday, have listed an end to executions as one of their conditions
for agreeing to enter negotiations with the white-led government.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson says South Africa
is trying to rig pre-independence elections in the territory
through a ``reign of terror.''
   The former presidential candidate made his remarks Thursday in
an appearance before the General Assembly's Fourth Committee, which
handles independence questions.
   Meanwhile, black African nations called for an urgent Security
Council meeting to condemn South Africa's administration in the
territory. U.N. officials said debate would probably begin early
next week.
   Jackson said South Africa was trying to rig the Nov. 7-11
elections to hurt the leading black nationalist party, the
South-West Africa People's Organization known as SWAPO.
   Jackson accused South Africa of promoting ``a reign of terror
taking part in Namibia today'' by keeping former Namibian commandos
and paramilitary police on the payroll but letting them act as
``armed vigilantes'' for anti-SWAPO parties.
   He also criticized the United Nations for not sending enough
peacekeepers to Namibia to prevent what he called ``a climate of
intimidation so as to make a free and fair election impossible.''
   The Security Council decided early this year to send only 4,650
military observers, rather than 7,500, as a cost-cutting move.
   Namibians are to vote for a constituent assembly to organize the
first independent, black majority-ruled government in the territory
of 1.3 million. The former German colony has been ruled by South
Africa since 1915.
   In December, South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cuba
agreeing to cooperate with a U.N. plan for Namibia's transition to
independence as Cuba withdraws its 50,000 troops from Angola.

<HEAD>Surgeons Deliver Baby from Dying Mother</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A surgical team at Suburban Hospital
delivered a baby boy from his dying mother about 30 minutes after
the woman suffered massive injuries in a traffic accident, hospital
officials said.
   Surgeons removed the infant by Caesarean section about 12:50
p.m. Thursday, a half-hour after the gravely injured mother, Ana
Hernandez, 27, had suffered cardiac arrest and stopped breathing, a
hospital spokesman said. Hernandez, who was in a two-car collision,
had been due to deliver the baby in about a week.
   ``You have to realize, when the mother's system shuts down, the
baby stops getting oxygen,'' said the spokesman, Michael Fortier.
``Obviously there's a lot of amazement, probably wonder, and a lot
of happiness'' that he survived.
   Dr. Ernest Hanowell, who helped deliver the child, called it
unusual that the baby survived in light of his mother's injuries.
Doctors were unable to restore Hernandez's breathing or make her
heart beat on its own, and she was pronounced dead about 45 minutes
after the birth.
   The baby boy, weighing about seven pounds, suffered ``oxygen
deprivation'' and was hospitalized in serious condition Thursday
night, officials said.
   ``It's extraordinary, but it's something we think about in
emergency medicine all the time,'' Dr. Hugh Hill, another trauma
surgeon, said of the emergency Caesarean section. ``It's something
we anticipate and we worry about it. It's one of those heroic
interventions we fear, yet hope will be successful.''
   Hill said surgeons did not have to choose between saving the
mother or the baby. Hernandez technically was not dead when she was
wheeled into the emergency room, Hanowell said, but she had
suffered massive internal injuries, ``and if no one was breathing
for her and pumping on her chest, she certainly would have been
dead.''
   Hernandez had no other children. Her husband was with her at the
hospital, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Pravda told its readers today that a confidant of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is replacing its conservative editor, who had
resisted letting the Communist Party daily fully embrace the new
openness sweeping the Soviet press.
   In a front-page report, Pravda said Viktor G. Afanasyev had
resigned and been replaced by Ivan T. Frolov, an advisor to
Gorbachev for the last year and a former editor of the party's
theoretical monthly journal Kommunist.
   The move appears to assure that the voice of the Communist Party
will now reflect more clearly the views of Gorbachev and his
reform-minded allies.
   Pravda is the country's most authoritative newspaper, but its
circulation has lagged under Gorbachev as readers turn to livelier
more informative newspapers. Its editor sits in on closed meetings
of the ruling Politburo.
   The removal of Afanasyev, a 66-year-old throwback to the rule of
Leonid I. Brezhnev, marks a further attempt by the Soviet president
to clean house of conservatives. Last month, three were retired
from the Politburo.
   The change at Pravda's helm also capped a turbulent week in the
Soviet press that first saw Gorbachev rebuke trailblazing editors
as taking glasnost too far, threatening to sack them.
   Some Soviet observers interpreted his criticism one week ago of
the editors who are the most outspoken practitioners of glasnost as
a way of softening the blow of Afanasyev's removal for party
conservatives.
   They interpreted Gorbachev's tactics as taking the middle course
at a time of rising tension over the poor state of the economy and
ethnic unrest.
   The departure of Afanasyev was announced by the official news
agency Tass on Thursday and also reported on state-run television
in its nightly news report. Pravda said the Politburo had on
Thursday accepted Afanasyev's request that he be transfered to
``scientific work.''
   Frolov, 60, is credited with formulating Gorbachev's foreign
policy that places priority on fostering values common to all
mankind, rather than encouraging class struggle.
   Afanasyev took over the party newspaper in 1976, during what is
now condemned as a period of stagnation when Pravda was accused of
masking more often than disclosing the truth.
   Under his tutelage, the paper's circulation fell as it lagged
behind other papers that more frankly cover national and
international affairs.
   Many Soviets turn now to publications such as Arguments and
Facts and Ogonyok, which are filled with breezily written
criticisms of the system.
   Arguments and Facts, a weekly, has a circulation of 26 million,
more than double last year's figure, and is the country's most
popular newspaper.
   At an Oct. 13 special party meeting with newspaper editors,
Gorbachev assailed some as sowing discord by being overly critical
of the leadership.
   He reportedly called specifically for the resignation of the
editor of Arguments and Facts, Vladislav A. Starkov _ apparently
for publishing a reader survey that gave members of a minority
opposition faction of the legislature the highest ratings,
questioning Gorbachev's popularity.
   But Soviet lawmakers, the weekly newspaper's workers and an
international organization, The Committee to Protect Journalists,
have rallied to defend the Starkov. On Thursday, members of
Starkov's staff said they had formed a work committee and elected
him head in a bid to protect him from being fired.
   Pravda last month suffered an embarrassment when it reprinted an
Italian newspaper's article claiming popular Communist maverick
Boris N. Yeltsin boozed and shopped his way through the United
States during a recent speaking tour.
   A few days later, Pravda apologized, saying the story could not
be substantiated.
   Like Afanasyev, Frolov is a full member of the Communist Party's
governing Central Committee and its Ideological Commission, and a
member of the Academy of Sciences' Philosophy and Law department.
   Afanasyev aide Vasily P. Popov said his boss would be going to
the academy, to which he has for some time to wanted devote his
attention more fully.

   Snow kept falling and thousands of people remained without
electricity in the Midwest today as the region endured an early
reunion with winter, just four days after temperatures had climbed
into the 80s. Near-record cold also settled in throughout much of
the Gulf Coast and South.
   Snowfall accumulations were 8 inches at Peru, Ind., more than 7
inches in Indianapolis and 4 to 6 inches in Fort Wayne and South
Bend, Ind., and Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, by late Thursday. It
still was snowing this morning.
   ``It was 80 degrees or above from October 12th to 16th,'' said
Ed Terrell of the National Weather Service in Indianapolis. ``By
the 19th, we had 6 inches of snowfall. That's a pretty good
turnaround.''
   Records for October snowfall totals were shattered throughout
the region. Cincinnati and Dayton had their earliest snowfall ever.
   But it was mostly rain in northwest Indiana because of warmer
lake temperatures.
   Service crews from Ohio's top power companies worked through the
night with little sleep to turn on the lights for 94,000 customers
still without power early today. Scattered outages also were
reported in Wisconsin
   Rain threatened flooding today in interior southeast New York,
where rivers and streams were running high, and along the southern
coast of New Jersey, which also faced gusty onshore winds.
   Temperatures threatened to dip below freezing tonight in
Georgia, Alabama, northwest Florida, inland Mississippi, western
Tennessee, northern Louisiana, northern and central Arkansas,
eastern Oklahoma and the northeast half of Texas.
   But southern Florida experienced record high temperatures in the
high 80s and low 90s on Thursday.
   The high temperature in the Lower 48 states Thursday was 95 at
Monrovia and Poway, Calif.
   Rain extended from the southern two thirds of New England to the
lower Great Lakes and south across the Virginias, Tennessee and
northern Alabama. Southern Florida also had rain Thursday.
   Snow showers Thursday reached from western lower Michigan across
eastern Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and western Kentucky. Chicago
had 2 inches of wet snow.

   A member of a crew inspecting a collapsed
section of Interstate 880 apparently became confused when leaving
the site and drove a truck off the edge of the highway, officials
said. The truck fell 30 feet.
   Lawrence Benigno, who works for the California Department of
Transportation, was pried from the truck Thursday night and taken
to Highland Hospital, according to Lisa Murphy, a department
spokeswoman.
   His condition was not immediately available. California Highway
Patrol Sgt. John Silva said Benigno suffered cuts and bruises, and
possibly a fractured hand.
   Silva said earlier that Benigno was upset shortly before the
accident. But he said a witness who gave him that information was
mistaken. Silva said Benigno was working at the site for the first
time and became confused as he drove off.
   The accident occurred at about 10:30 p.m. at the northern end of
the twisted section of freeway that crumpled in Tuesday's quake and
trapped an undetermined number of drivers inside.

<HEAD>Dinkins Unable to Explain Discrepancy in Valuing Stock Holdings</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK _ Democratic mayoral candidate David Dinkins says he's
not sure why he valued a cable TV company's stock at $1 million but
sold it to his son for a fraction of the sum, according to a
published report today.
   Dinkins told The New York Times in an interview Thursday that
when he learned that his stock in Inner City Broadcasting was worth
$1 million or more, he could not believe it.
   He said he learned of the estimate by company officials from his
secretary.
   ``The day the secretary says this is true, I thought it was
almost like a big joke,'' Dinkins recalled. ``I said, `Like, I'm a
millionaire.'''
   He said that to avoid a conflict of interest when he became
Manhattan borough president, he sold the shares to his son David
Jr. in 1986 for $58,000 _ a price he said he randomly picked
without consulting tax lawyers or accountants.
   The Democratic front-runner provided no explanation for the
different values placed on the stock, saying, ``It didn't seem to
matter much'' at the time.
   Asked what could have caused the discrepancy, he said, ``I
really don't know.''
   The true worth of Inner City's stock _ difficult to assess
because the company is privately held rather than publicly traded _
is important because Dinkins might owe gift taxes on its sale, say
tax experts and campaign aides for Dinkins' opponent, Rudolph
Giuliani.
   New York Newsday on Thursday quoted the general counsel of Inner
City as saying the stock in 1984 was conservatively worth $4,292
per share, or $2.5 million for Dinkins' 588 shares.
   But Dinkins said the company's general counsel, John Edmonds,
might have inflated the price of Inner City stock to obtain a loan,
Newsday said today.
   Edmonds told Newsday on Thursday he had not inflated the value
of the stock but could offer no explanation for the different
prices. ``I made that statement on my judgment based on what the
value was in my judgment. He's right and I'm right,'' Edmonds said.
   The Daily News reported Thursday that Dinkins' former secretary,
Raquel Vidal, said her boss had set the stock's value at ``$1.3
million or something like that'' when he submitted a sworn,
confidential report to Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The report was submitted when Dinkins was a candidate for
director of the State Urban Development Corporation.
   ``Based on the publicly available information, it appears to me
that David Dinkins owes between $285,120 and $848,291 to the
federal government and as much as $195,626 more to the state,''
said Giuliani's campaign manager, Peter Powers, according to
today's New York Post and Daily News. Powers said he was a tax
lawyer.
   Dinkins said he was reviewing his tax forms and any liability he
might have.
   He accused Giuliani of ``gutter politics'' after the latter's
week of unrelenting criticism on Dinkins' handling of the stock
sale. He threatened to respond with negative attacks of his own.

   Typhoon Elsie moved out to sea today
after battering the northern Philippines with winds up to 127 mph
and leaving at least four people dead and thousands homeless.
   In a final typhoon bulletin at 4 a.m., the Manila weather bureau
said that Elsie, the strongest storm to strike the country this
year, was about 240 miles northwest of Manila in the South China
Sea.
   Elsie blew ashore Thursday, but forecaster Juliet Dagupa said
the winds had weakened today to 103 mph and was moving west at 14
mph.
   The Red Cross said two people were killed in Isabela province
when they were struck by irons sheets torn off from houses. One
person was crushed to death by a falling tree in La Union province
and another died in a landslide on the outskirts of the mountain
resort town of Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila, the Red Cross
said.
   The Civil Defense Office said more than 22,100 people sought
temporary shelter in schoolhouses and government centers or
reported their houses either damaged or destroyed.
   Officials said at least 6,106 houses were destroyed in six
northern provinces hit by the typhoon.
   Officials said many northern provinces lost electricity when
high winds toppled power lines. Fallen trees littered the national
highway and blocked dozens of other roads.
   Domestic flights from Manila to northern Luzon were canceled and
the coast guard ordered ships to stay in port in the affected area
for the day. U.S. Air Force officials said some jets had been moved
to air bases in Japan and South Korea.
   Elsie was the third tropical storm to strike the Philippines in
two weeks.
   Tropical storm Dan hit Manila and southern Luzon on Oct. 10,
killing at least 59 people. On Oct. 6, Typhoon Angela killed at
least 119 people in northern Luzon.
   An average of 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike the
Philippines annually. Elsie is the 17th of 1989.

   China's tough austerity policies have cooled off
the overheated economy but have made few inroads in solving basic
flaws in the system, the government said today.
   In a report on economic performance through September, Zhang
Zhongji, spokesman for the State Statistical Bureau, said the
year-old austerity program had held the gross national product to
$30 billion, up only 5 percent from the same period in 1988.
   National industrial output for September reached $29 billion, up
only 0.9 percent from the same month last year.
   Zhang said consumer demand was down, the rise in retail prices
had been brought under control and ``the whole economy is taking a
favorable turn.''
   But he acknowledged that ``no major breakthroughs had been
achieved'' in resolving chronic supply-demand imbalances. He said
there was serious overstocking of some products because of market
slumps and poor circulation of money because many companies are
delaying payment of debts.
   Zhang also criticized the ``behavior of some enterprise managers
and factory directors who still have doubts about the current
policy so they don't exert all their efforts to promote
production.''
   Since last fall the government has sharply reduced credit
available for investment, ordered the suspension of thousands of
building projects and tightened central controls over distribution
and pricing in an attempt to curb industrial growth that exceeded
20 percent last year and reduce an inflation rate of more than 30
percent.
   Following the military crackdown of pro-democracy dissent in the
spring, the conservatives now in power have also demanded that
large state-owned industries be given priority in receiving
financing and supplies.
   Authorities have moved to restrict the growth of small
collective and private enterprises that have thrived during the
past decade of economic reform.
   Zhang said the output value of collective enterprises grew 12.5
percent over the first three quarters to $87 billion, compared to a
growth rate of only 5.2 percent for state-owned industries, which
had an output value of $162 billion.
   But he said the growth rate of collective and township
enterprises was slowing dramatically.
   He said 19 to 20 percent of state-owned enterprises continue to
operate in the red. He cited the ``deterioration of economic
efficiency'' and the serious overstocking of some products.
   Retail sales were up only 12.3 percent to $164 billion, far
lower than growth rates of more than 30 percent during a period of
panic buying last fall.
   Institutional buying was up only 6.2 percent, to $14 billion.
   The Statistical Bureau said that in the first eight months of
this year $20 billion worth of goods were piled up in warehouses,
compared to $7.5 billion at the same time last year.
   Zhang said the average retail price increase so far in 1989 was
about 22 percent and continued to fall. In Septmber, prices were up
only 13 percent from the same month last year.
   He said, though, that it will be ``extremely difficult'' to meet
the government target of bringing inflation down to 10 percent by
year's end.

<HEAD>Production Drops in Key Government Sectors, Grows in Private Sector</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production fell in seven key sectors,
including food and steel, during the third quarter of 1989 while
prices and wages grew in an inflationary spiral, according to
another gloomy government report published today.
   The steel, chemical, paper, engineering, transport, food and
fodder industries produced less in the first nine months of the
year than during the same period of 1988, according to the main
statistical office known by its Polish initials GUS.
   At the same time, there was a 30 percent increase in production
from Poland's private sector, newly liberated from many government
regulations. But because the private sector accounts for only about
6 percent of the economy, the report said the growth there could
not balance the production decreases in government industries.
   There were better results from the government's power, mineral,
timber, electro-engineering, electronical, textile, clothing and
printing industries, the report said.
   Several factors have been blamed for the production drop:
outmoded factories; lack of production materials; factories not
paying suppliers for lack of payment from customers; and the flight
of workers to the private sector, black-market activities or to
work abroad, where they can earn more.
   Also, former Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula told a
government committee this week that the former government erred in
its decision to freeze prices, which caused enterprises and private
farmers to cut back production.
   The government report is the key quarterly analysis of the
Polish economy, but it follows numerous other commentaries from the
new Solidarity-led government and from Poles themselves on the dire
state of finances.
   The government faces a budget deficit of about $2.3 billion, and
it could reach $4.4 billion by the end of the year without radical
cost-cutting steps.
   An oversupply of money has cleared store shelves of goods and
further driven up prices. The price of butter, for example, is up
more than 1,000 percent since August.
   Government controls had kept food prices artificially low. The
controls were lifted Aug. 1 as part of the transformation designed
to create a market-oriented economy.
   The economic report said food prices are now 300 percent to 400
percent higher than at the start of the year, while prices of other
goods were 200 percent to 300 percent higher.
   A monthly report for August put overall price increases at 50
percent for that month, which would translate into an annual rate
of 600 percent.
   Employment continued to decline in the five main branches of the
government-run economy, with the jobless rate rising from 2.6
percent in January to 5.4 percent in September.
   Workers have been reported to be abandoning their jobs in the
state industries for higher salaries in the private sector.
   Pay rates rose substantially in the five main branches of the
economy, from a monthly $42 in the first quarter to $99 in the
third quarter. By mid-October, the average overall salary was $114
a month.

   Atlantis' five astronauts plunged
into a heavy schedule of medical, scientific and photographic
experiments today after being awakened by three rousing college
fight songs.
   ``We've got a full day planned for you,'' Mission Control told
the astronauts, and even before they had breakfast, they were asked
to take pictures of Gibralter in the Mediterranean for a film being
made about Earth's environment.
   The wakeup songs were from colleges attended by the three
mission specialists on board, ``Boomer Sooners,'' ``UConn Huskies''
and ``Victory March.''
   Shannon Lucid attended the University of Oklahoma, Franklin
Chang-Diaz the University of Connecticut and Ellen Baker the State
University of New York at Buffalo.
   The flight plan today called for the crew to continue
experiments that measure Earth's damaged ozone layer and study the
effects of weightlessness on the human body, the processing of
polymers and the growth of corn and ice crystals.
   The nuclear-powered Galileo probe the astronauts deployed about
six hours after blastoff Wednesday was zipping across the solar
system at 9,000 mph in great shape, officials reported.
   The $1.5 billion probe's course for its six-year,
2.4-billion-mile trip to Jupiter involved more than 400,000 miles
of travel by midday today. Once it reaches Jupiter, Galileo is
expected to give the best look yet of another planet and find clues
to the universe's origin.
   Galileo was pronounced in ``perfect shape'' and ``right on
course'' Thursday by NASA, and Atlantis also was given a clean bill
of health after the crew members restored a cooling system that
shut down the previous day when it overheated, cutting in a backup
unit.
   Atlantis is scheduled to land at 2:38 p.m. EDT Monday at Edwards
Air Force Base, Calif.
   The other shuttle crew members are commander Don Williams and
pilot Mike McCulley.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Baker and Chang-Diaz demonstrated a retinal
photography experiment that could be seen on NASA satellite
television.
   With swimming goggles strapped around her head, Mrs. Baker
steadied herself on the shuttle's middeck while Chang-Diaz pressed
a camera to the right goggle to photograph her retina.
   ``We're trying to hold ourselves steady, which is probably the
hardest part of this task,'' said Mrs. Baker, a medical doctor.
   Researchers want to study the 35mm camera slides to determine if
there are any changes in the eye's vessels in zero gravity. Such
changes could indicate some brain swelling, and researchers want to
find out if that is related to motion sickness in space.
   Also Thursday night, a camera in the cargo bay showed
spectacular views of Typhoon Elsie in the Philippines.
   ``It's a real big storm,'' Williams said.
   Weather permitting, the astronauts hope to capture images of Los
Angeles, North and South Korea, the Grand Canyon, the Dallas-Fort
Worth area, Tokyo and several Japanese volcanoes.
   They are using a special IMAX camera that produces detailed film
that can be shown on extra-large screens. The film collected today
will be used in two movies.
   The astronauts will try to photograph lightning systems,
providing data that researchers say could help develop better
weather-predicting methods.
   A new experiment aboard the shuttle uses a sensitive instrument
in the cargo bay to measure the ozone layer, which protects the
Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.
   The measurements taken aboard Atlantis will be compared with
data being collected at the same time and over the same areas by
nearly identical sensors aboard three older U.S. satellites. The
new data will be used ot help calibrate the satellite sensors.
   Many people fear depletion of the ozone layer will cause a rise
in health problems such as skin cancer. NASA has scheduled the same
experiment for six more shuttle flights.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today accused Sudanese
government troops of killing 34 civilians in the southern town of
Wau in late July, apparently to avenge the death of a soldier whose
truck hit a mine.
   The international human rights organization said an unspecified
number of other civilians were seriously injured in the same
incident, in which soldiers dumped the victims' bodies in a well in
the northwest section of the town.
   It said most of the victims were refugees of the Dinka and Luo
ethnic groups who had been living in Wau.
   They were arrested shortly before being killed, Amnesty
International said.
   The group added it had collected the names of the dead and also
of 13 of the injured.
   The Sudan government has not commented on the alleged massacre,
but the civilian government, before its ouster in a coup June 30,
denied similar allegations against the army.
   ``Amnesty International is particularly concerned because these
killings do not appear to be isolated cases,'' a statement said.
``Its information reveals a persistent pattern of serious human
rights violations in the context of the civil war in the south.''
   It said many civilians and captured members of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army had been killed by the army and
government-allied troops.
   Amnesty International urged the Sudanese government to
investigate the alleged massacre. It also issued appeals on behalf
of former Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, ousted in the coup, and
his wife, Sara al-Fadil Mahmoud.
   It said el-Mahdi was abused and threatened for refusing to back
the new military government, and subjected to a mock execution.
   The government last week denied a report that el-Mahdi was being
tortured. A statement said his family has regular visits and that
anybody else could visit him for evidence he had not been tortured.
The statement did not mention his wife.

   Commonwealth leaders disagreed
today over whether they should invest $18 billion in a joint fund
to protect the environment.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed establishing a
Commonwealth fund, arguing that additional resources should be
channeled through the U.N. World Environmental program.
   Officials of the 49-nation Commonwealth, the association of
Britain and its former colonies, said several other leaders also
supported holding off on establishing the fund.
   After discussing the issue, the leaders left for a weekend
retreat at Langkawi Island, 210 miles from Kuala Lumpur. There,
they will consider both the final draft of an environmental
declaration and try to agree on a joint statement on South Africa,
the main issue dividing them.
   Armed police lined the road from the Langkawi Island airport to
the beach resort where the summit delegates will stay. Young
Malaysian women dressed in batik sarongs and white vests greeted
each head of government.
   Hotel workers in white uniforms lined up and, to the
accompaniment of guitars, broke into a version of ``Have You Ever
Seen The Rain?''
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said Thursday the leaders
will try to ``reach a concensus'' over the weekend on strategy
toward South Africa. His plan stipulates that the Commonwealth call
on international banks to tighten financial sanctions against South
Africa.
   Mrs. Thatcher, the sole opponent of sanctions, has argued that
South African President F.W. de Klerk's moves toward reform deserve
encouragement. During the morning debate on the environment, India
pushed its proposal for a ``planet protection fund,'' which it
first put forward at a summit of the Non-Aligned Nations in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last month.
   The aim of the fund would be to ``bring within the easy reach of
all countries, developed and developing, the technologies to combat
pollution and environmental degradation,'' India's statement said.
   New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer said leaders divided
into three groups: those who want a fund set up now; those who
oppose the fund; and those who support leaving open the possibility
of a fund in the future.
   ``The developing countries tend to say, `You must pay,' and the
developed countries say, `We are not going to pay,''' Palmer told a
news conference.
   Earlier, the summit host, Malayasian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, complained that developing countries were to blame for
pollution.
   But Commonwealth spokeswoman Patsy Robertson told reporters, ``I
think they agreed, developed and developing, that we are all
polluters, each in our own way.''

   Civilian courts and military tribunals
have sentenced 100 people to death during the past three months,
the government announced today.
   Col. Aung Thein, a government spokesman, told a news conference
that of the 100 sentences, 24 were passed by military courts set up
to deal with ``serious offenses.''
   How many, if any, among the 100 have been executed was not
announced. Neither were the alleged crimes of those condemned to
death.
   A 17-man military junta has wielded power in Burma since
September 1988, when troops crushed a nationwide pro-democracy
uprising.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon estimate that several thousand
people have been arrested since July, when the military rulers
moved against the country's top pro-democracy leaders.
   The United States also has accused the Burmese government of
torture and death of political detainees. Rangoon has denied such
charges.

<HEAD>Planned Parenthood Announces Formation of Political Arm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Planned Parenthood Federation of America has
announced the creation of a political arm that will lobby
legislators against abortion restrictions.
   Citing the recent Supreme Court ruling giving states more
authority to regulate abortion issues, organization president Faye
Wattleton announced the formation of the Planned Parenthood Action
Fund at a news conference Thursday opening the group's 66th annual
meeting.
   ``The Webster decision put women's access to abortion in grave
danger,'' Wattleton said. ``Webster left us with no other choice
but to become even more politically aggressive than we had been
before to ensure that the right to choose abortion remains secure.''
   The Action Fund's first-year budget of $1 million, which must be
raised separately from Planned Parenthood's regular funds, will
allow the national organization to expand its current lobbying and
political campaign activities nationwide, Wattleton said.
   Final tax status approval from the Internal Revenue Service is
expected in three to four months, she said.
   The change will not affect the existing organization, which will
retain its tax-exempt status that limits its spending to $250,000
on grass-roots campaigns in individual states and $1 million
nationally.
   Contributions to the new fund will not be tax deductible, but
donations to the parent organization still will be.
   The fund's initial effort will be a newspaper advertising and
direct-mail campaign targeting the voting records of at least a
dozen congressmen Planned Parenthood feels are a threat to abortion
rights, Wattleton said.
   More than 1,200 delegates are attending the annual convention,
which runs through Sunday.
   On the agenda is a debate among the organization's leadership
regarding whether it will direct efforts toward a constitutional
amendment protecting abortion rights. Wattleton predicted a
decision by Sunday.
   Also scheduled to make an appearance at the convention is Dr.
Etienne-Emile Baulieu, developer of the controversial abortion pill
RU 486, who will receive a scientific research award from the
organization.

   Brown University, acting in the wake of
attacks by blacks on white and Asian students, has canceled two
social events for tonight that would have been attended mainly by
black students.
   The school canceled Funk Night and a dance sponsored by Omega
Psi Phi, a black fraternity, said Robert Reichley, vice president

   He would not explain why officials canceled those events and not
others during the annual Parents' Weekend at the Ivy League school.
   ``Our intention is not to make every move public,'' he said
Thursday.
   Reichley said the university wants to make sure campus social
events are retricted to students so they are easier to supervise.
   There have been 19 reports of assaults or robberies on 22
students since classes began in September. At least 14 incidents
were assaults on white and Asian male students, who described their
attackers as black teen-agers who did not appear to be students,
Reichley said.
   Campus and Providence police have increased security efforts and
Brown President Vartan Gregorian, in a statement this week, said he
might ask for unspecified federal help. He said some of the attacks
appeared to be racially motivated.
   Troy Priest, a senior who is president of the Brown chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
said he wanted to study the cancellation of the social events
before commenting.
   ``The way it has been applied may not be fair,'' Priest said.
``But I want to talk to the university officials first.''
   Reichley said the attacks had heightened tension on the campus
where racial and anti-homosexual graffiti was written on the walls
of a dormitory last spring. A march against violence is planned on
the campus Sunday night.

<HEAD>Jets Fly Through Wind Shear Despite Warnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Retransmitting to CORRECT summary line.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal report says four United Airlines jets
flew through a dangerous wind shear at Stapleton International
Airport last year when pilots either did not hear or misunderstood
a control tower warning.
   The report released Thursday by the General Accounting Office
said one jet canceled its approach, but four others went through
and eventually landed safely.
   ``Four commercial airline pilots from one airline flew into
microburst activity, despite prior warning by the controllers and
explicit airline policy to avoid microburst alert areas,'' the
report said. ``The crews either did not hear clearly or did not
know the meaning of the term `microburst alert.'''
   A microburst is produced when a downdraft of heavy air hits the
earth and causes winds to spread horizontally along the ground. A
plane going through one experiences a head wind, then a downdraft,
and finally a tailwind, which can cause a crash.
   The Stapleton microburst pushed winds in opposite directions at
92 miles an hour, officials said.
   ``They were lucky,'' said James Evans, a researcher with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has helped conduct tests
on the radar detecting the wind shifts.
   None of the four pilots who landed during the incident could
remember getting the alert, said Bob Ireland, who was staff
engineer with United's flight training center in Denver at the time.
   ``They flat didn't remember it. ... It was no wonder they didn't
hear it. That's a very, very busy time for pilots,'' he said.
   The GAO recommended in its report that controllers be required
to reroute air traffic when microbursts are detected, even if
pilots think it's safe.

   Norwegian peacekeeping troops clashed today
with Israeli-backed militiamen who kidnapped a civilian in south
Lebanon, U.N. sources said.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
30-minute clash involved automatic rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades and occurred after the militiamen grabbed Lebanese citizen
Mohammed Adib Abdul-Hadi in the town of Shibaa.
   A six-man Norwegian patrol ``tried to prevent a force from the
South Lebanon Army militia from holding Abdul-Hadi against his
will. The SLA men opened fire at the Norwegian patrol and the
Norwegians returned fire,'' the source said.
   He said no casualties were reported in the clash, which ended
when the Lebanese force withdrew deep into the Israeli-controlled
zone in south Lebanon, taking the detained man with them.
   There were no injuries in the firefight.
   The 702-strong Norwegian battalion serves with the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which patrols a narrow buffer in
the southern provinces separating the zone Israel has controlled
since 1982 from the rest of Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Jury selection got under way in the attempted
murder trial of former ``Diff'rent Strokes'' actor Todd Bridges,
accused of shooting a man at a house where crack was sold.
   Bridges sat in court Thursday as judicial commissioner Candace
Cooper asked potential jurors if there were any reasons they could
not hear the trial, expected to last six or seven days.
   As a teen-ager, Bridges, now 24, played the older brother of
star Gary Coleman in the NBC series ``Diff'rent Strokes.''
   He is charged with shooting Kenneth Clay in February at a
reputed crack house in Los Angeles. Prosecutors contend Bridges
shot Clay, an alleged member of a drug ring, several times and
tried to slash his throat in a dispute over Clay's use of a luxury
car owned by the actor.
   At a preliminary hearing in March, Clay testified that Bridges
was ``based out'' on co`his eyes looked like they
were going to jump ocaine and that `ut of his head'' during the confrontation.
   Harvie Eugene Duckett, 30, pleaded guilty to being an accessory
in connection with the case and was expected to testify against
Bridges.
   Bridges has had several other brushes with the law. He pleaded
no contest last year to charges he made bomb threats against an
auto customizer he hired to work on a car of his. Also last year,
he was convicted of reckless driving, and in 1983 he paid a $240
fine for carrying a concealed firearm.

<HEAD>Pope Hails Changes in Poland in Meeting with Prime Minister</HEAD>
<HEAD>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II embraced Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland today and urged his countryman to
continue down the path of reform.
   Mazowiecki took office on Aug. 24 to become the first
non-Communist leader of a Soviet bloc nation. He thanked the pope
for supporting Poland's opposition movement ``during the difficult
years'' of government oppression.
   Mazowiecki, a Roman Catholic intellectual and old acquaintance
of the pope, made Rome his first foreign visit since his
appointment as prime minister.
   The pope called the 20-minute meeting ``historic.''
   In an emotional reunion, the two-men embraced outside the pope's
private library, the site of the closed-door talks. John Paul told
an aide there was no need for introductions.
   Later, Mazowiecki said the meeting was the ``crowning, the fruit
of the dialogue, of which today we see the results.''
   John Paul turned toward a Polish television crew and responded
in Polish, `We hope there's no turning back.''
   ``This is not possible,'' said Foreign Minister Krzystof
Kubiszewski.
   John Paul's return to Poland in June 1979, eight months after
his election to the papacy, helped spark demands for democracy that
led to the formation of Solidarity, the first non-Communist labor
movement in the Soviet bloc.
   During the dark years following the martial law crackdown of
1981, John Paul helped keep the Solidarity spirit alive, including
making a return to his homeland in 1983.
   The church, which has historically played a pivotal role in the
overwhelmingly Catholic country, took part in the long negotiations
that led to elections this year and approval of a 24-member Cabinet
that includes 12 Solidarity members and four Communists.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro quoted some words from the
pope t emphasize that John Paul had acted not only as a Pole but as
head of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church.
   ``If I did something, I did it as part of my universal mission
and it should be viewed as such,'' the Vatican quoted the pope as
telling Mazowiecki. ``I consider this audience an historic and
positive fact. However, it is not historic for me only under a
patriotic profile...''
   As evidence of the changes sweeping the Soviet-bloc, John Paul
on Friday ordained as bishops the Vatican's first ambassador to
Poland since the Communists broke diplomatic relations after World
War II and the first Roman Catholic bishop in Soviet Byelorussia in
60 years.
   Aides said Mazowiecki, long a Solidarity adviser, and the pope
have met about 20 times during John Paul's 11-year pontificate,
most recently when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa came to Rome in
April.

<HEAD>Mexican Drug Cartel Reportedly Slays 4 Jehovah's Witnesses By Mistake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Jehovah's Witness missionaries who
disappeared while preaching door-to-door in Mexico five years ago
apparently were slain by drug smugglers who mistook them for U.S.
agents, a published report says.
   The Justice Department linked the slayings of the two married
couples to the drug cartel implicated in the torture-killing of
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena, the Los
Angeles Times reported today.
   Dennis Carlson, 32, and his wife, Rose, 36, of Redding, Calif.,
and Benjamin Mascarenas, 29, and his wife, Pat, 27, of Ely, Nev.,
are thought to have been killed in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Dec. 2,
1984, the newspaper reported.
   The couples were believed to be following the religion's
well-known practice of preaching door-to-door, working in an
upper-class Guadalajara neighborhood, before they disappeared, the
newspaper said.
   They apparently ``went to the wrong house,'' the newspaper
quoted a source as saying. ``They were suspected of being DEA
agents.''
   Federal investigators believed the couples were buried in the
same Guadalajara park where Camarena initially was buried, the
report said. Camarena disappeared in February 1985; his body and
that of his pilot were found a month later buried on a ranch
outside Guadalajara.
   The bodies of the missionaries have not been found.
   Federal authorities have indicted several members of an alleged
drug cartel in the Camarena slaying, including reputed kingpin
Rafael Caro Quintero, who is in custody in a Mexican prison.
   Last week, Caro and 11 others also were indicted in Los Angeles
in connection with the slayings of two U.S. citizens one month
before the Camarena killing. Authorities believe they, like the
missionaries, were killed in a case of mistaken identity because
drug lords thought they were DEA agents.
   The Times quoted sources as saying that charges may never be
brought against the suspects in the missionary slayings because the
evidence is largely circumstantial.

   The lowly spud never had it so good.
   A bunch of potatoes from Idaho, California, Washington state,
Michigan and faraway Chile was gussied up and served at a gourmet,
seven-course luncheon Thursday by the Watergate's renowned French
chef, Jean-Louis Palladin.
   They were shredded, diced, pureed, baked, fried, simmered,
glazed and dunked in rich cream sauces by Jean-Louis and his staff.
Then they were escorted out of the kitchen by tuxedo-clad waiters
under the bright glare of camera lights, to the oohs and aahs of a
half-dozen diners.
   The all-potato menu was prepared for the benefit of a Japanese
television crew that is touring the United States filming a
half-hour history of the potato chip, which was supposed to have
been invented in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1853.
   To give the visiting Japanese an idea of the potato's
versatility, Jean-Louis was asked to prepare a dream lunch
featuring nothing but potato dishes. He happily obliged. ``I was
raised all my life with potatoes,'' he said.
   Jean-Louis began with tiny potato pancakes containing smoked
salmon and topped with caviar, followed by a cream soup of purple
Chilean potatoes with Idaho potato dumplings and purple potato
chips. Next came Icelandic langoustines wrapped in fried, shredded
potatoes in a ginger sauce.
   His piece de resistance, especially created for the lunch, was a
risotto of finely diced white rose potatoes from California and
poached Maine scallops in squid ink, covered with shavings of
parmesan cheese and fresh white truffles that cost $720 a pound.
   After cannelloni of Idaho potatoes stuffed with wild mushrooms
and goose liver pate in a tomato sauce, and breasts of wild
Virginia doves with pureed Red Yukon potatoes from Michigan and red
wine gravy, the dessert was a sweet potato sorbet with tiny potato
pastries.
   Tani Kei, the host of the TV show, sighed contentedly as he
finished with an espresso.
   A popular entertainer in Japan who took his stage name from
America's Danny Kaye, Tani Kei said his favorite potato dishes back
home are less fancy and more robust. He likes his potatoes boiled,
baked or simmered with chunks of beef, soy sauce, sugar and sweetd enough
rice.
   But Fujiyoshi said the postwar generation of Japanese are crazy
about potatoes, especially French fries and chips. He said potato
chips, which account for more than $700 million in annual sales in
Japan, once came in three dozen flavors _ from hot chili sauce and
shrimp to onion and carrots.
   ``Now we are beginning to like the Americans' plain, salted
potato chips,'' Fujiyoshi said. ``But we have no dips, not yet.''

   Rescuers plucked a baby from a sinking car
ditched in a creek by a man who had assaulted the infant's mother,
police said.
   ``The water was coming up to the baby's chest and it was still
rising,'' said police officer T.L. Scott. ``If he had not been in
the child seat, I am more than convinced he would have drowned.''
   Officers were heading for the scene of an accident involving a
stolen car early Thursday when they found the automobile in a
rain-swollen creek and the baby inside.
   In the predawn darkness, Scott reached into the back seat, which
was two-thirds full of water, and pulled out the 9-month-old boy.
   The infant's mother, Felichia Peace, reported she was assaulted
as she talked on a pay phone. The man threatened her with a gun and
tried to drag her behind a convenience store, but she managed to
grab a bottle from atop an ice machine and hit him in the head,
police said.
   She broke free and ran to a nearby house and called police. When
she went back outside, she discovered her car was gone _ with her
son, Tirone D. Peace, in the back seat.
   No arrests have been made, police said.

   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said
today it is preparing to open as many as 17 assistance centers to
process applications from victims of northern California's
earthquake disaster.
   The centers, which probably will be open by Sunday, will be
located in the seven counties that President Bush declared disaster
areas after Tuesday's earthquake.
   Robert Blair, a FEMA spokesman, said people who suffered
property losses in the earthquake will be able to apply for
low-cost loans and receive other advice from federal officials at
the centers.
   Meantime, Blair said the toll-free telephone lines opened
Thursday to assist victims are being clogged by calls from people
who have not been affected by the earthquake.
   ``Some people are calling looking for loved ones,'' he said.
FEMA, he said, is unable to handle that kind of call, which he said
could be handled by the Red Cross.
   He said the 110 FEMA telephone lines are staffed round-the-clock
to handle questions, such as where homeless people should go.
   The telephone number for those FEMA lines is 1-800-462-9029.

   Janice Freiburger kept thinking she wasn't
ready to die as she struggled to escape a car wedged in a gap
between the collapsed upper deck of the Bay Bridge and the split
lower deck.
   As she fumbled with her seat belt and climbed across the
driver's seat, Freiburger hoped her movements would not tip the
crushed car into San Francisco Bay.
   Freiburger, helped to safety, suffered a cracked breastbone,
cracked spine and cracked collarbone in the wreck. The impact of
the accident left her a quarter-inch shorter, doctors said.
   From her hospital bed Thursday, she said she felt ``very sore
but very lucky. Happy to be here.''
   She and Bruce Stephan, the driver of the gray 1984 Mazda,
marveled that they were the only ones on that section of bridge as
it collapsed in Tuesday's rush-hour earthquake. A small red car
seen flying over the edge in a home video tape shown on national
television this week arrived minutes later, after most traffic had
managed to stop. The driver was killed.
   Stephan's car crumpled like tin, and he can't explain why it
didn't plunge into the bay.
   ``The ground just opened up and the car started going down,'' he
said. ``All I could think is `I'm going through the bridge and into
the bay.' ... I knew it was death. I didn't think there was
anything that could stop us.''
   At his apartment in San Francisco, Stephan said he was searching
for reasons why he survived the unthinkable with no more than a
sore neck. Maybe, he said, he will get a chance to save someone
else.
   ``It seems like it should be more profound. It was kind of a
brush with death, but I don't feel that much different,'' said the
33-year-old.
   He and Freiburger, 41, of Larkspur, work at a San Francisco real
estate company. They were returning from a project in the East Bay
when they were caught on the bridge.
   ``I'll live with the aches and pains of bruises and just be
thankful I'm here,'' said Freiburger, who may be released early
next week.
   ``It all happened in just split seconds,'' she recalled. ``First
there was a moment of utter silence and then boom, an
explosion-type of noise. It all opened up. We went traveling down
like a roller coaster ride, just that fast.''
   Stephan thought at first that he had four flat tires. When the
bridge began bouncing and weaving, he knew it was an earthquake.
   ``I closed my eyes real tight and made my mind blank,'' he said.
``You know how you're supposed to have all those flashbacks and
your whole life flashes before your eyes? That didn't happen. ... I
told Janice, `We're going to die,' and she said, `No, we're not.
Hold on.'''
   When the car slammed to a stop, Stephan climbed out the window
and onto the hood of the car. Propelled by fear, he reached
overhead and hoisted himself up onto the surface of the bridge's
lower deck.
   Despite her injuries, Freiburger was able to scramble out of the
car and onto the hood. Stephan and a stranger pulled her to safety.
She immediately started walking toward Treasure Island.
   ``Everyone said, `This is amazing,''' recalled Stephan,
describing the rush-hour crowd of drivers on the lower deck of the
bridge. ``But since we weren't bleeding, everyone pretty much
wanted to get off the bridge themselves.''
   It was more than a mile to Treasure Island and Freiburger was
having trouble breathing, but the pair kept walking.
   ``I was in a great deal of pain and I just knew that I was going
to make it,'' Freiburger said.
   After preliminary treatment at a clinic, the two were taken by
ambulance to San Francisco General Hospital.
   Neither Stephan nor Freiburger is eager to cross the bridge when
it reopens.
   ``When the ground drops out from underneath you, it's kind of
hard to trust anything,'' he said.
   Vowing to try it eventually, Freiburger conceded the return trip
may be a long way off.
   ``I'm certain I will never cross any bridge without some
anxiety,'' she said. ``But it's something I will have to work with.
When you live in the Bay area, there are a lot of bridges.''

   Colombia's judges and other court
workers returned to work today after failing in a three-day strike
to force the government to protect them from drug traffickers.
   ``We are certain that more of us will be murdered in coming
months, but we can't shut down the court system for very long,''
said Consuelo Herrera, a federal judge and member of the court
workers' union, the Association of Judicial Employees.
   The 5,000 judges and 12,000 other judicial workers walked off
the job Tuesday after a federal judge was slain by drug dealers in
retaliation for the extradition of drug suspects to the United
States.
   Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 other judicial employees
have been killed in Colombia. The Association of Judicial Employees
says 1,600 of the 5,000 judges have been threatened with death in
the last 12 months.
   Ms. Herrera said union workers are prepared to strike again the
next time a judge or court worker is murdered by drug traffickers.
   ``The next strike will be longer and the next one longer
still,'' she said. ``We will continue to call strikes as long as we
are being killed and the government continues to do nothing.''
   Ms. Herrera said Justice Minister Roberto Salazar Manrique told
union members in a meeting Tuesday that the government lacks the
resources to increase protection for judges.
   She said none of the $19 million in aid promised by the Bush
administration to protect Colombian judges has arrived in the
country.
   Meanwhile, the Bogota daily El Tiempo published an account of
yet another attempt by the Medellin cocaine cartel to begin talks
with officials on ending the government crackdown on the drug trade.
   An unidentified Medellin lawyer representing the cartel spoke
two weeks ago with the country's leading leftist, Bernardo
Jaramillo, a candidate in March presidential elections, El Tiempo
quoted Jaramillo as saying.
   Jaramillo was quoted as telling the lawyer that he favors
dialogue with the traffickers but not while the traffickers are
setting off bombs and killing people.
   The Medellin cartel has made several contacts with government
officials and other politicians in attempts to negotiate a truce in
the 2-month-old war on drugs.
   President Virgilio Barco has said there will be no talks and no
truce.
   Barco resumed extraditions to the United States on Aug. 18
following the slayings of a leading presidential candidate, a
federal judge, and a police colonel by drug barons.
   But the traffickers have struck back with a terror campaign that
has included more than 160 bombings and the assassinations of eight
news industry workers.
   The government on Thursday pressed ahead in its anti-drug
offensive by arresting two drug suspects, one the alleged personal
pilot of the presumed head of the Medellin cocaine cartel, Pablo
Escobar.
   The pilot, Jorge de la Cuesta Marquez, is wanted on federal
charges in Florida, national police Col. Oscar Pelaez Carmona said
in a news release.
   De la Cuesta, arrested in a raid on a north Bogota apartment, is
wanted on a U.S. indictment for conspiracy to distribute cocaine
and will be held for extradition, Pelaez Carmona said.
   With de la Cuesta's arrest, five Colombians await extradition to
the United States.

   Two Palestinians suspected of collaborating
with Israel were stabbed to death today by fellow Arabs, and one
body was wheeled around the streets of a West Bank city as a
warning to others, Arab reports said.
   Government officials said Secretary of State James A. Baker III
telephoned Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir Thursday to try to get the
stalled Middle East peace process restarted.
   On Tuesday, Shamir publicly criticized U.S. proposals that he
fears are aimed at pressuring Israel to talk with the PLO.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post reported the United States
has offered to sign a ``memorandum of understanding'' to rule out
any PLO involvement in preliminary peace talks. Israeli officials
declined comment.
   Arab reporters said 24-year-old Taher Abu Saleh was stabbed to
death in Nablus. Shortly after dawn, they said, masked Palestinians
pushed the corpse in a cart through Nablus' central market before
dumping it on the street.
   The death was blamed on the Red Eagles, one of two Arab gangs
reportedly active in Nablus against suspected collaborators.
   The second killing occurred in the Gaza Strip's Breij refugee
camp. Arab reporters said Harb Odeh Essa, 43, was attacked in his
home by masked Palestinians. He was suspected of having ties with
Israeli authorities, they said.
   Essa was dead on arrival at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, and
doctors said his throat was cut.
   The army confirmed the Nablus killing and said it was checking
the Gaza case.
   The deaths raised to 132 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in the 22-month uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 596 Palestinians, and
40 Israelis have been slain.
   Baker's call to Shamir followed three other recent contacts:
Shamir's call to President Bush on Tuesday, a phone conversation
Wednesday between Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Baker,
and a letter Thursday from Shamir to Baker.
   All appeared aimed at easing tension created by Shamir Tuesday,
when he warned members of his right-wing Likud bloc of ``a tense
period with the United States.''
   He later told a political rally that ``The stone-throwers, the
fire-bombers have not succeeded in driving us into the arms of the
PLO. It is not possible that when they fail to do this, others by
diplomatic means ... would try to bring us to meetings with the
PLO.''
   The comments were seen as slaps at Baker, who has put forward a
proposal designed to get Israel to accept an invitation from Egypt
for preliminary talks with Palestinians.
   Today, Shamir aide Avi Pazner told The Associated Press that in
the latest phone conversation Baker and Shamir discussed how to
move ahead on Israel's peace plan, which calls for elections in the
occupied lands as a first step toward limited autonomy.
   The Jerusalem Post report said the Bush administration has
offered to prepare a ``memorandum of understanding'' that would
cover Shamir's main objections to Baker's plan. The memorandum, the
Post said, would rule out involvement by the Palestine Liberation
Organization and restrict preliminary talks to Israel's proposed
elections in the territories.
   It quoted unnamed government sources as saying Shamir was ``not
inclined to accept the administration's offer in its present form.''
   Shamir is to visit Washington in mid-November to discuss the
peace process.

   A man described as having an ankle fetish
pleaded guilty to kidnapping a Bible student in a nine-hour ordeal
in which prosecutors said he tried to cut off her feet and eat her
flesh during a satanic ritual.
   John William Doughty, 38, entered his plea Thursday as his trial
was about to begin and after prosecutors agreed to drop charges of
attempted murder and first-degree assault.
   Doughty admitted during court proceedings to abducting the woman
Nov. 13. He did not say why he abducted her, but maintained he was
mentally competent at the time.
   Doughty has three prior felony convictions in Florida involving
a burglary and rape, the kidnapping of a 12-year-old child and the
slashing of a 16-year-old girl's ankles with razor blades, said
Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Kevin Johnson after the court
session.
   ``Doughty has an ankle fetish,'' Johnson said.
   Doughty had corresponded with a Minneapolis woman while serving
the rape sentence in a Florida prison. He later moved to Minnesota
and stayed with the woman and her family and began attending their
church, the Faith Assembly of God in St. Louis Park, said Johnson.
   Two months later, he lured an 18-year-old woman to the church
parking lot, clubbed her over the head, put her in the trunk and
drove to a park in Minneapolis, Johnson said.
   He tried to kill the woman as a sacrifice to Satan, Johnson said.
   In the nine-hour ordeal, Doughty tried to cut off the woman's
feet and said he had planned to eat her flesh and throw her body
into the Mississippi River, court documents said.
   He cut tendons in the woman's legs, but was unable to sever her
feet and yielded to her pleas to take her to a hospital after she
promised she would not identify him.
   The victim, a student at North Central Bible College, has
regained her ability to walk normally, Johnson said.
   Doughty is to be sentenced Dec. 28. He faces a maximum term of
40 years.

<HEAD>Opposition Figure Says Give Krenz a Chance</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with seven grafs to UPDATE with rally; picks up 7th pvs,
``It doesn't...''</HEAD>

   An East German opposition figure said people have
been too quick to condemn the country's new leader and he urged
citizens to give the reputed hard-liner a chance to institute
reforms, a newspaper said today.
   On his first full day as head of the country, Egon Krenz on
Thursday chatted with factory workers in East Berlin and portrayed
himself as open to dialogue and change.
   Krenz also met with a church leader and opened the way for a new
law regulating foreign travel.
   The image of the active leader engaged in frank discussion with
workers contrasted sharply with the stiff, reclusive manner of
Erich Honecker, who was removed Wednesday after 18 years in power.
   Opposition groups say the new Communist Party chief's politics
differ little from those of his autocratic predecessor.
   More than 10,000 people demanding change rallied in the city of
Zittau, in southeastern East Germany, on Thursday night, said
activists from the New Forum pro-democracy group.
   But Rolf Henrich, a New Forum member, was quoted today as saying
Krenz should be given time to change people's minds.
   ``It doesn't make sense to deny him a chance from the very
start,'' Henrich was quoted as saying in the West German newspaper
Badische Zeitung.
   He said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was also once a
supporter of the ``party apparatus.''
   ``And look how excited we all are about what's he doing now,''
Henrich said.
   Krenz, 52, faces the most serious threat to orthodox Communist
rule in East Germany's 40-year history, as tens of thousands flee
to the West and thousands of others who do not wish to leave
agitate for a more open society.
   He already has said the party will resist the democratic reforms
under way in Poland and Hungary.
   Nonetheless, West Germany's ARD television network said his
meeting with factory workers would have been ``unthinkable only a
few weeks ago.''
   The broadly publicized meetings appeared aimed at showing the
country's 16.5 million people that Krenz will deliver on his pledge
to address East Germany's problems as long as the party's leading
role remains intact.
   When asked by Krenz why so many co-workers fled to West Germany,
metal worker Ronald Berus said, ``A lot of things kept adding up
until some people felt there was no alternative.''
   ``Until last week, you couldn't talk about problems, and people
just got fed up,'' he said.
   Several workers complained of rigid travel restrictions to the
West, which were recently expanded to bar travel to Czechoslovakia,
Poland and Hungary without government permission. Thousands of East
Germans have made their way to the West through those countries in
recent weeks.
   In one of his first official acts in office, Krenz said the
government is drafting a new law that could ultimately ease travel
abroad. He said West Germany's refusal to recognize East German
citizenship is an obstacle. Bonn grants East Germans automatic
citizenship.
   Wolfgang Lueder, a member of West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's ruling coalition, today was quoted as saying Bonn could help
expand travel by allowing East Germans to change money for West
German marks. East German currency is not convertible.
   Lueder was quoted in an interview with Cologne's Express
newspaper as saying the move would be a ``subsidized exchange.'' He
suggested Bonn could use the new East German marks to buy more
goods from East Germany.
   In addition to talking with factory workers, Krenz on Thursday
met with Werner Leich, head of the East German Lutheran Church
Federation, for talks described by East German television as ``open
and constructive.'' The church has been at the forefront of reform
efforts.
   Krenz said in his first national address as party leader that he
has no intention of sharing power with opposition groups.
Nevertheless, New Forum activists said Thursday that local
Communist Party officials in Potsdam offered to open limited talks
with them.

   Protesters clashed with the bodyguards
of West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper during a rally today outside the
federal Parliament building.
   The anti-military service group ``Action for Total Refusal'' was
protesting federal efforts to force a convicted draft dodger to
serve jail time in West Germany.
   Federal officials are trying to extradite Gerhard Scherer from
West Berlin to begin serving a five-month sentence for refusing
both mandatory military service and the alternative Civilian
Service option for those opposed to violence.
   West German residents of West Berlin are not subject to the
compulsory service law because of the city's status under Allied
control.
   About 10 demonstrators, protesting illegally on the Parliament
grounds, startled Momper's security detachment when they abruptly
unfurled a banner that had been hidden in a bouquet of flowers the
demonstrators tried to press on Momper.
   One of the protesters wore a rubber mask of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl on the back of his head and had his coat on backwards as well,
creating the impression he had his back to Momper when he leaped
forward to unfurl the banner.
   Startled security men wrestled the masked protester to the
ground, and others engaged in brief skirmishes with demonstrators
to separate them from Momper's party.
   Momper, a member of the left-wing Social Democratic Party, had
been asked by the anti-military service group to reject the
extradition request. He was at the federal Parliament building
today to be inaugurated as president of the Bundesrat, the upper
house of Parliament.
   Demonstrations are forbidden on the West German Parliament
grounds, but no arrests were made following the incident early
Friday.
   Scherer was a resident of Baden-Wuerttemberg state when he
reached the military service age. He is in hiding in West Berlin,
where authorities have been asked to find him and return him to
Baden-Wuerttemberg to serve his term.

   Thousands of residents in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin woke up
to no electricity today after winter's surprise attack on autumn a
day earlier that dumped up to 6 inches of snow over the region.
   Snow was still falling this morning in Illinois and Indiana. By
midmorning 8.5 inches had fallen in Indianapolis in a 24-hour
period. Southern states also were caught off-guard by unseasonable
cold; Georgia officials were barraged with phone calls from
homeless people seeking shelter.
   Two deaths were attributed to the storm, which set records
throughout the Midwest for earliest measurable snowfall when it
arrived Thursday.
   A firefighter in Kentucky was electrocuted by a downed power
line and a Ohio man was killed when his car skidded and hit a
pickup truck on a snow-slickened road near Dayton.
   More than 200,000 utility customers had been without service
late Thursday in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin, but by
daybreak power had been restored to all but 51,000.
   Utility spokesmen said the blackouts were far more widespread
than they would have been if the storm struck later in the season
because most trees still had their foliage. The leaves trapped the
wet, heavy snow until branches snapped from the weight, downing
power lines.
   Ohio power crews worked through the night to repair downed
lines, but 29,000 customers in Cincinnati and Dayton were still
without power by midmorning.
   Cincinnati set up an overnight shelter for people without heat
in their homes. Officials at the Bush Recreation Center said about
25 people stayed there Thursday night, and the center was kept open
today.
   The winter preview followed a weekend of unusually balmy weather
with temperatures in the 70s and low 80s in the Midwest.
   ``Don't put your spring coat away,'' said Ohio National Weather
Service meteorologist Bob Thompson. ``We had Indian summer last
week and now this, and we'll have Indian summer next week.''
   About 17,500 people were still without power today in southern
Michigan, mostly in the Detroit area. Four to 6 inches of snow was
reported early today in Gaylord, in the northern Lower Peninsula.
   In Wisconsin, which got 6 inches of snow in the southeastern
part of the state, 5,000 utility customers were without power as of
sunrise, said Lisa Berman, spokeswoman for Wisconsin Electric Power
Co.
   Six inches of snow fell in Milwaukee in the 24-hour period that
ended at 7 a.m. today. The previous record for the whole month of
October in Milwaukee was 4 inches, the National Weather Service
said.
   Northern Illinois received about 5.3 inches of snow over the
past 24 hours, but because of temperatures that hovered slightly
above freezing, only about 2.5 inches remained on the ground today,
said National Weather Service forecaster Carl Williams.
   ``There's precipitation over much of Illinois. ... Every
reporting station is reporting snow. In southern parts, rain is
mixed with snow,'' said Williams.
   Light snow fell in the mountains of northern Georgia today and a
freeze warning was issued for the entire state for tonight.
Columbus, Ga., had a record low temperature of 34 early today,
breaking the mark of 35 set in 1981.
   Emergency overflow shelters were opened in Atlanta and Fulton
County Thursday, bringing calls from people looking for a warm
place to sleep. Most winter volunteer shelters do not open until
Nov. 1.
   Bill Holland, shelter coordinator for Task Force for the
Homeless, said, ``Everywhere I called was at maximum capacity, but
everybody was able to get somewhere out of the night, so I felt
pretty good.''
   The chill penetrated even South Florida. West Palm Beach managed
to set two records within 18 hours _ a high of 92 Thursday and a
low of 56 this morning.
   Elsewhere in the state today, Tallahassee bottomed out at 34,
Pensacola chilled to 35, Apalachicola wasn't far behind at 42,
Daytona Beach hit 44 and Orlando dropped to 46 _ all records for
the date.

   A tour bus filled with vacationers
crashed into a truck today north of Sydney and killed at least 22
people, including seven members of one family, police said. It was
Australia's worst bus accident.
   Both drivers were among those killed in the head-on collision on
the Pacific Highway near Cowper.
   The tour bus was carrying about 42 passengers, said Keith
Weinert, managing director of Sunliner Coaches, which owned the
bus. It was 320 milesnorth of Sydney, en route to Brisbane, when
the accident occured at about 4 a.m.
   Witness Michele Bowling, whose family farm is near the crash
site, described the scene: `The vehicle was on its side with smoke
pouring from it and I could hear screams from people trapped in the
bus.''
   She said her paddock had been turned into a makeshift morgue.
   Colin Ormsesher, an advertising executive on a New South Wales
central coast newspaper, survived the crash, but the dead included
his wife, their two teen-age children, his brother, sister-in-law
and their two children.
   Ormsesher's brother, Les, had arrived with his family from
England on Monday for a holiday in New South Wales and Queensland.
   The families were on their way to the Whitsunday Islands in
northern Queensland for a boating holiday.
   The cause of the accident was not known.

<TEXT>
   Nine United Mine Workers members were
arrested and charged in a series of bombings at a mine where a
strike has been under way for five years.
   The miners arrested Thursday were accused in two bombings, an
attempted bombing and a fire that did $400,000 damage at Milburn
Colliery, where 45 union members went on strike in October 1984.
   Authorities planned to seek indictments next week before a
federal grand jury in Charleston, said U.S. Attorney Michael Carey.
   One miner, Larry Massey, was charged with destroying property
involved in interstate commerce, Carey said. He faces 10 years in
prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted. Eight others were
charged with conspiracy to use explosives and faces up to five
years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
   All nine were arraigned before a federal magistrate in Bluefield
and freed on $10,000 bond.
   The UMW's chief spokesman, Joe Corcoran, said the union was
unaware of any evidence implicating the nine.
   ``In any strike situation, there are many allegations and
accusations that turn out not to be true,'' he said.
   In June, not long after the mine's owners hired a new company to
operate the mine, a bomb was set off at a bridge entrance, and in
July a fire resulted in about $400,000 damage, Carey said.
   Then last month, a bomb caused about $35,000 damage to a mine
ventilation system, and authorities disarmed a 57-pound time bomb
before it exploded, Carey said.
   No one was injured in the incidents.
   Carey said the investigation is continuing, but would not
comment on whether further arrests are expected.

   An Irishman cleared by an appeals court of a
14-year-old terrorist bombing was freed on bail today pending his
appeal of a separate murder conviction.
   Paul Hill's release by a Belfast court meant all the so-called
Guildford Four are now free after a long fight for exoneration.
   The four were serving life sentences for two Irish Republican
Army bombings that killed five people in 1974 in Guildford,
southwest of London. A London judge overturned the convictions
Thursday, ruling that police officers probably lied to get the four
convictions.
   The government immediately ordered an inquiry into alleged
police misconduct.
   While three of the four were freed Thursday, 35-year-old Hill
was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a British
soldier, and he was flown to Belfast to begin an appeal.
   He was freed today on $6,500 bail and emerged from the court to
cheers from friends and relatives, including his 14-year-old
daughter, Cara.
   ``I am very happy,'' he replied to a reporter's question. ``How
do you think I feel after 14 years of hell?''
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible for
police, said in a BBC-TV interview Thursday night that the
Guildford case was ``a blow for the whole system'' of criminal
justice in Britain.
   David Williams, deputy chief constable of the Surrey county
police force, whose officers handled the original investigation of
the Guildford Four, said Thursday that three officers had been
suspended from duty pending the inquiry by retired appeals judge
Sir John May.
   Williams identified them as a sergeant and two constables. He
said a fourth officer involved, a detective inspector, had died and
a fifth, a detective chief inspector, had retired.
   The ruling ended years of work by relatives, former government
officials, church leaders and journalists to overturn the verdict.
The sentence had been upheld in 1977 even though IRA members made
detailed confessions in the case.
   The appeals court threw out the convictions of Gerard Conlon,
35, Patrick Armstrong, 39, and Hill, all of Belfast, and Carole
Richardson, 32, of London, in the bombing of two pubs at Guildford
in Surrey on Oct. 5, 1974.
   The convictions of Armstrong and Hill for a pub bombing in the
London suburb of Woolwich on Nov. 6, 1974, also were reversed. Two
people died in that attack.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In ``Dangerous Games,'' the collective title of
two dance theater pieces created by Graciela Daniele, the theme is
domination, primarily sexual and political, done to a tango beat.
   In ``Tango,'' two sinister, working-class brothers violate and
then fight over a young prostitute; in ``Orfeo,'' a reworking of
the Orpheus legend, the hero seeks to rescue his love from the
Argentine secret police who operate out of a place not unlike Hades.
   All of this, which arrived at Broadway's Nederlander Theater on
Thursday, is not as interesting as it might sound, even though the
evening contains some haunting tango music by Astor Piazzolla.
   The dancing is a tad pretentious and a bit silly, particularly
when it's trying to be sexy. Daniele's choreography is filled with
steamy clinches, erotic posturing and a heavy dose of whips and
leather. It's light years from the romantic duets that were the
main attraction of a different kind of tango entertainment, ``Tango
Argentino,'' a mild Broadway success several seasons ago.
   ``Tango'' is the earthy, simple and more successful of Daniele's
two dances. The two brothers (Gregory Mitchell and John Mineo) are
violent, narcissistic men, stereotypes of the macho Latin
tradition. They fight, strut and then take whatever they want,
particularly the new woman in the bordello (Tina Paul).
   Paul is not only a fine dancer but she's an actress, too, making
the woman's brutalization all the more convincing. In the end, she
is the most poignant victim, transformed into someone as hard and
as uncaring as the men who used her.
   In ``Orfeo,'' Daniele reaches for political significance and
falls short. The piece is dedicated to the ``desaparecidos,'' the
Spanish word for all those who were arrested and then disappeared
during the brutal Argentine military dictatorship.
   Daniele's Orfeo (Gregory Mitchell, again) is a gaucho who sees
his love (Rene Caballos) spirited away by Pluton (Ken Ard), who
wears military fatigues and a beret. Ard is an athletic dancer who
projects an unnerving menace. But he's also saddled with some of
William Finn's worst lyrics, particularly when he sings about ``the
joys of torture.'' The lyrics seem to be an intrusion on the
evening and could have been cut with little harm to both pieces.
   The choreography can't support the weight of Daniele's political
message. At times, it has a folksy, Agnes de Mille quality,
peasants cavorting around the stage. At other times, it reaches for
the mock solemnity of Gerald Arpino, recalling the Joffrey Ballet
clinker, ``Sacred Grove on Mount Tamalpais.'' But it's never as
moving as its subject matter.
   Tony Straiges has designed a tawdry and forbidding bordello for
``Tango,'' and an all-purpose red wall meant to signify hell in
``Orfeo.'' Patricia Zipprodt's costumes are surprisingly
understated, all-black outfits for the men and billowy dresses for
the women.
   Daniele, who has choreographed Broadway musicals including ``The
Pirates of Penzance,'' ``The Rink'' and ``The Mystery of Edwin
Drood,'' needs more of a story line on which to hang her dances.
Her choreography isn't compelling enough to compensate for the thin
tales she and co-author Jim Lewis have concocted for ``Dangerous
Games.''
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: If theater people want to make a
spectacle of themselves on a Broadway stage, that is their
inalienable right, but whatever happened to the poor audience's
right to enjoy a few laughs in the face of such disaster?
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: While the choreography in both is
virtuosic and danced with great vehemence and ardor, Daniele's
imagination seldom goes beyond the adolescent in her depiction of
the earthiness and sensuality of the brothel or the repressiveness
of the generals.
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: The sad thing is that the dancers
do their level best to raise this grisly corpse of an evening into
some semblance of life _ as if they were literally flogging a dead
horse.

<TEXT>
   The voice of Laurence Olivier thundered through
Westminster Abbey today as 2,000 guests, including most of
Britain's greatest actors, paid homage to the late giant of stage
and screen.
   The recorded excerpt of Olivier's speech to the troops in
Shakespeare's ``Henry V'' was the highlight of a service honoring
Olivier.
   ``There may be imitators, but there is no second Olivier. He was
unique,'' Sir Alec Guinness, said in the eulogy.
   Sir John Gielgud, 85, recited from John Donne's Holy Sonnet,
delivering its opening line in a gravelly whisper: ``Death be not
proud...''
   Dame Peggy Ashcroft recited from John Milton's ``Lycidas,'' and
Sir John Mills and Albert Finney read passages from the Bible.
   Lord Olivier, as he was known after his 1970 ennoblement, died
on July 11 at age 82 and was buried at a small family funeral in
southern England. His ashes will be laid finally to rest next year
in Westminster Abbey.
   Although it marked a death, the nationally televised service was
alive with triumphal music swelling through the cavernous abbey,
and there were occasional chuckles as Guinness remembered some of
the lighter moments of Olivier's life.
   Leading the congregation was Olivier's widow, the actress Joan
Plowright. Also present was Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth II's
youngest son and an aspiring actor. Deputy Prime Minister Sir
Geoffrey Howe represented the government.
   Other actors present included Michael Caine, Peter O'Toole,
Derek Jacobi, and Michael York, and Italian film director Franco
Zeffirelli.
   Guinness, 75, said Olivier ``stands alongside the acknowledged
great ...''
   ``Even allowing for violent changes of fashion, I feel that each
of those tremendous actors of the past would have recognized his
style, applauded him and welcomed him as one of their own.''
   ``Great,'' a much-abused word, readily applied to Olivier,
Guinness said. ``Perhaps it consists of a happy combination of
imagination, physical magnetism, a commanding and appealing voice,
an expressive eye -- and danger.''
   He singled out Olivier's 1946 performance of ``King Lear,'' when
``He spoke with the utmost simplicity, the speech which begins
`I'll pray, and then I'll sleep'.
   ``He knelt, center-stage, facing the audience, and made no
movement. He created an awful stillness...''
   Guinness summed up Olivier as ``Ambitious, determined, brave and
daring. A full life, lived generously and shared with all of us. He
has, I am sure, the nation's gratitude.''
   He concluded with two famous lines from Hamlet:
   ``Good night, sweet prince,
   ``And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.''

   Many hunters get hurt simply by falling out of
trees, not by being shot by other hunters, federal health
researchers said.
   The Centers for Disease Control, which studies injuries as well
as disease, reported Thursday the results of a Georgia study
showing that 36 percent of hunting injuries involved tree stands _
the perches where deer hunters wait for prey.
   The CDC and Georgia officials studied 594 deer hunting-related
injuries in the state over the 1979-89 hunting seasons: 214
involved tree stands, which may be hastily built platforms or
store-bought tree chairs.
   Seventeen people died, fractures were common and several
teen-age hunters suffered neck fractures and were paralyzed.
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Dr. Steven Gordon,
an epidemiologist with the Georgia Department of Human Resources.
``The nature of the system is such that the only reports we get are
the ones that are fairly serious.''
   He added: ``We're sure this is occurring in other states. But no
one had systematically looked into it.''
   When most people hear of hunting accidents, they picture one
person shooting another, said Joel Brown, Georgia's state
hunter-safety coordinator. But in recent years, he said, more than
50 percent have involved tree stands. ``It's a serious problem,''
he said.
   Most of the tree stand injuries involved falls; 111 hunters were
hurt when they tumbled out of their stands, 49 fell while trying to
climb down and 40 fell while trying to climb up. Gordon said the
average stand was 16 feet above the ground.
   Twenty-seven injuries _ and eight of the 17 tree stand
fatalities _ occurred when weapons went off accidentally, either
while firearms were being carried up and down the tree or on impact
from a fall.
   Sixty-one of the 214 tree stand mishaps involved mechanical
failure, as the stand or its steps collapsed under the hunter's
weight.
   Eleven hunters reported they had fallen asleep just before
falling out. Eight hunters either admitted they were drunk or were
suspected of it by game officials.
   That number, Gordon said, might be low. ``We could not assess
the influence of alcohol or other substance abuse. ... Most of
these hunters did not have blood-alcohol levels taken,'' he said.
   While some hunters simply lost their balance, some suffered
bizarre accidents.
   A law enforcement officer chopped down small trees surrounding
his stand to improve his view of the deer. He fell from his stand
onto the jagged tree stumps and was severely injured, Brown said.
   Another hunter, Brown said, climbed a tree in a pond, not
knowing the tree had been killed by beavers. The tree broke in two
and the hunter was killed when he tumbled out and the tree fell on
top of him.
   Gordon said a woman was hurt when she shot a deer from her tree
perch and the wounded animal charged. The impact from the deer
crashing into the tree dislodged her and she broke a leg in the
fall.
   Some of the injured hunters were asked whether they had taken a
hunting safety course; two-thirds hadn't. And none of the 214
injured hunters was wearing a safety harnesses or seat belt.
   Many mishaps could have been prevented, the CDC said, if hunters
had used safety harnesses, unloaded their guns while climbing up
and down, used pull-up cords to hoist their weapons into their
stands and checked the condition of their stands before climbing in.

   Mayor W. Wilson Goode, hospitalized early
today because of concerns about high blood pressure, was reported
alert and talking to family and staff.
   ``He looked a little tired, but he didn't look sick at all,''
said Karen Warrington, the mayor's press aide, who said she saw him
at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Goode was
transferred there from Lankenau Hospital before dawn.
   Goode, 51, was taken to the hospital because ``he just didn't
feel well, he felt like he was having some symptoms of high blood
pressure,'' she said.
   Goode is serving his second four-year term as mayor.
   Goode was treated by Dr. Arthur Whereat, who made no immediate
comment on the mayor's condition or on how long he would stay at
the hospital.
   The mayor suffers from high blood pressure, but Ms. Warrington
said she did not know if he takes medicine for the condition.

   Parliament, meeting to move Hungary
closer to democracy, voted today to disband a militia that was
created to protect the Communist Party after the 1956 revolt.
   The legislature also approved proposals to rehabilitate victims
of political trials during Hungary's years of Communist oppression.
   The decision to disband the militia came just three days before
the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 revolt, which was crushed by
Soviet tanks.
   The bill had been opposed by the Socialist Party, which assumed
power after the Communist Party was formally dismantled Oct. 7.
   The Socialist Party, which professes democratic ideals but
remains in sole possession of power at least until parliamentary
elections next year, had suggested disarming the force but keeping
it as a civil defense organization.
   ``The existence of the Workers Militia ... is no longer
justified,'' declared Justice Ministry State Secretary Gyula Borics
in introducing legislation to dissolve the 60,000-strong force.
   Of votes cast on the issue, 274 were in favor of termination,
with six against and 30 abstentions.
   Parliament already rehabilitated revolutionary leader Imre Nagy
and his leading associates earlier in the year.
   Parliament had already rehabilitated revolutionary leader Imre
Nagy and his leading associates earlier in the year, but the bill
passed today was broader, extending to all those convicted of
revolutionary activity during the a956 uprising.
   The bill, which also pledged unspecified compensation to
victims, was approved by 278 legislators, with four against 26
abstentions.
   A similar but separate bill also formally rehabilitated those
victimized between 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially
considered Hungary's Stalinist period.
   Parliament has been meeting in a historic session aimed at
removing the vestiges of 41 years of Communist rule. On Thursday,
Parliament passed legislation permitting opposition parties to
compete in the first free national elections since 1948.
   Lawmakers still must settle a dispute over when to select a new
president.
   A proposal agreed on by the Socialist Party and most major
opposition parties suggested that voters cast ballots on Nov. 26,
with subsequent heads of state appointed by Parliament.
   But some opposition groups fear the ruling party would have too
strong an advantage if the president were chosen next month.
   They have collected nearly 200,000 signatures calling for a
referendum on whether the president should be chosen now or only
after national elections redistribute political power. Parliament
is to try and sort out the issue at its next session, beginning
Oct. 31.

   Three Hill Air Force Base security
policemen have been arrested in a federal ``sting'' operation that
uncovered thefts and illegal sales of military property, the FBI
said.
   Gregory Lewis Hawley, 27, Robin James Olson, 21, and Robert Todd
Young, 23, were arrested without incident Wednesday by agents of
the FBI, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Air
Force Office of Special Investigations. They were charged with
theft of government property.
   The arrests were part of Operation Punchout, a three-year
undercover investigation that prosecutors say eventually could
result in charges against more than 100 people.
   The three were among nine people charged in sealed indictments
that were handed up Oct. 13 by a federal grand jury in Ogden. An
additional 12 persons were charged earlier in a separate sealed
indictment handed up in Salt Lake City.
   In the undercover operation, FBI agents posed as operators of a
mock military surplus store in the town of Roy, 35 miles north of
Salt Lake City. They netted an assortment of government munitions
and equipment, including three F-16 jet engines.
   Two men from Hill, Airman 1st Class Brian David Roth and Senior
Airman Danny Joe Stroud, pleaded guilty Wednesday to stealing the
engines and selling them to the undercover agents. They were two of
the 12 named in the earlier indictment.
   The guilty pleas were part of a deal that will result in
additional charges being dropped when they are sentenced Dec. 12.

   U.S. military experts left Friday for
Vietnam for the eighth joint field investigation to resolve the
fates of American soldiers missing from the Vietnam War, a U.S.
Embassy official said.
   For about 15 days, the two U.S. teams will investigate areas in
Song Be province and Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam and Ha
Bac province near Hanoi, the embassy official said.
   They included specialists of the Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and forensic experts from the Army Central Identification
Laboratory, said the official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified. They will cooperate with workers from Vietnam's Office
for Seeking Missing Personnel.
   Both U.S. agencies are based in Hawaii and entrusted with
resolving the fates of America's wartime missing.
   About 2,340 Americans are listed as missing in action from the
Vietnam War, which also involved fighting in Cambodia and Laos.
U.S. combat involvement ended in 1973 and the communists toppled
U.S.-backed South Vietnam in April 1975.
   The United States and Vietnam began the joint field
investigations in October 1988. These involve inspecting plane
crash sites and interviewing villagers who may have seen the
crashes.
   On Sept. 11, Vietnam returned what it said were believed to be
three sets of remains of missing Americans.

   President Roh Tae-woo returned Friday
from a six-day visit to the United States and said his trip helped
the two allies improve their security and trade relations.
   Roh said President Bush reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the
security of South Korea and the continued presence of U.S. troops
in South Korea.
   Roh said his trip helped the two allies ``enter a new stage as
partners for progress.'' He said South Korea and the United States
agreed to expand trade and solve trade friction ``with mutual
understanding and cooperation.''
   Meanwhile, about 500 students armed with firebombs battled riot
police at Sungkyunkwan University to protest the visit, shouting
``Drive out the Yankees!'' and ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!''
   At Korea University in Seoul, about 400 students staged a
peaceful anti-U.S. protest after burning the Stars and Stripes and
demanding an end to U.S. efforts to open South Korean markets wider.

   Ministry of Agriculture officials
Friday began slaughtering 5,000 salmonella-infected chickens owned
by a group of nuns who previously had locked themselves in their
coop to protect their flock.
   The 13 nuns offered no resistance when the officials arrived at
the Our Lady of Passion Monastery 70 miles north of London to carry
out a task they tried to start two weeks ago.
   The ministry officials, accompanied by a government-appointed
veterinarian, were led into the hen house by grim-faced nuns.
   The hens' necks were wrung and the carcasses were put in
cardboard boxes that were loaded onto trucks for deliver to a dump
site.
   During the slaughter, about six animal rights protesters
demonstrated outside the convent, holding a banner that said:
``5,000 killed today, 45 million killed every year _ Don't support
factory farming.''
   The nuns, led by a Kentucky-born mother superior, Sister
Catherine, had gone to court seeking to overturn the ministry's
ruling that their eggs were a serious health risk, but did not
succeed.
   Two weeks ago, they locked themselves in the henhouse for three
hours to prevent the slaughter from being carried out.
   The nuns were to receive some compensation from the government
but it was likely to be only a fraction of the $95,400 they say
they need to finance a new venture, making luxury chocolates.
   Sister Catherine said the order would survive, although it has
lost its livelihood.
   ``The first thing I am going to do is buy a crystal ball,'' she
joked. ``At this moment I just don't know what we are going to do.''

   A man whose doctors gave him only two
weeks to live went on a shooting rampage, killing two men and then
himself, police said Friday.
   Peter Crack, armed with a .22-caliber pistol, killed his first
victim at a gun club at Stockport near Manchester on Thursday night
and his second victim on a Stockport street an hour later, police
said.
   Crack then holed up in an empty house near Manchester Airport,
said Assistant Chief Constable Jim Paterson of the Greater
Manchester police force.
   Officers surrounded the house and tried to talk him into
surrendering, but three hours later they heard a shot and found him
dead inside, he said.
   Crack, 30, had been undergoing treatment for cancer at
Manchester's Christie Hospital and was told recently he had two
weeks to live, Paterson said. He was married with a 2-year-old
daughter.
   The first slaying occurred Thursday night at the Stockport
Shooting Center, a gun club where Crack had gone for target
practice, Paterson said.
   In a commotion that started because Crack left himself in the
firing line, he shot and killed Duncan Allman, 31, who was
supervising the practice, Paterson said.
   Crack then fled and an hour later arrived at the home of an
acquaintance, Howard Savage, 27. Crack and Savage left the house
and crossed the street into an alley leading to garages where
Savage was shot several times, Paterson said.

   The leader of a grassroots political group in the
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan was arrested Friday after
demonstrating against bills giving legal status to the Russian
language along with the local tongue, sources said.
   Abdurakhim Pulatov of the Berlik _ or ``Unity'' _ group took
part in a Thursday protest in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent one
day before the republic's legislature took up the bills, said
Abdumanot Pulatov, another member of the organization.
   The demonstrators believe the bills do not go far enough in
protecting the status of the Uzbek language.
   One source said the Berlik leader was arrested for resisting
police. He said downtown Tashkent was flooded with police and army
troops Friday as the session of Uzbekistan's Supreme Soviet
parliament began.
   At Thursday's rally, attended by an estimated 50,000 people,
police reportedly beat women and the elderly, and arrested 300
people.
   Berlik is fighting pollution in the southern Soviet republic,
which is flooded with pesticides used for cotton, and for
protection of the Uzbek culture and language from Russian
influences.
   Berlik also supports greater freedom for Moslems who predominate
in the republic for practicing their religion.

<HEAD>Fourth Batch of Vietnamese Boat People Repatriated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 120 Vietnamese who made the
treacherous boat journey to Hong Kong flew back home Friday after
their hopes for a new life were dashed in the teeming camps of this
British colony.
   Another group of about 120 is expected to return home within
days, and 850 others are awaiting repatriation on later flights,
according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
   A chartered Boeing 737 carried 52 men, 47 women, 12 boys and 11
girls to Hanoi, bringing the number of Vietnamese repatriated under
the U.N.-sponsored program to 385 in four flights since March.
   Waving their red boarding passes and shaking hands with refugee
relief officials, the Vietnamese boarded the plane carrying plastic
shopping bags filled with personal possessions. Some parents
carried toddlers while other Vietnamese carried huge ``boom box''
cassette players.
   ``We believe that voluntary repatriation works,'' said Anne
Shepherd, deputy chief of the U.N. refugee office in Hong Kong.
``The number of people applying has increased substantially.''
   She said that since the voluntary repatriation program started
in mid-1988, the number of Vietnamese applying to go home has
increased from about 30 a month to about 65 each week.
   But the number of Vietnamese volunteering to go home represents
only a fraction of the nearly 44,000 boat people in the colony who
have not been granted refugee status, and the Hong Kong government
says other measures are needed.
   Hong Kong officials maintain that boat people who are denied
refugee status must be repatriated against their will if necessary,
but Hanoi has yet to accept such a program.
   Washington also has expressed opposition to forcible
repatriation.
   The returning boat people are taken to their hometowns and
monitored by the U.N. refugee organization. ``So far, we have had
no indication of any problems'' for the returning Vietnamese, Ms.
Shepherd said on the tarmac of Hong Kong international airport.
   Boat people returning to their impoverished Communist homeland
receive $50 for adults and $25 for children by the U.N.
organization.
   The Hong Kong government earlier accepted all Vietnamese boat
people as refugees entitled to resettlement. But under a tough
policy adopted in June 1988 to stem the rising tide of
asylum-seekers, the government ruled out resettlement for new
arrivals unless they could prove they were fleeing political
persecution.
   The vast majority of the more than 44,000 boat people to arrive
under the new policy will fail to receive refugee status.
   Nearly 12,700 Vietnamese still in Hong Kong camps arrived before
June 1988 and are eligible for resettlement.

   Relatives who insist Raoul Wallenberg is still
alive said Friday the search for the Swedish diplomat who vanished
decades ago after saving thousands of Jews will continue in a
prison next week.
   ``There is evidence that Raoul had been at various periods
between 1950 and 1980 in the prison of Vladimir'' about 75 miles
from Moscow, said Guy von Dardel, Wallenberg's half-brother.
   Soviet authorities say Wallenberg, who is credited with saving
tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Nazis during World War
II, died in another prison in 1947, two years after he was arrested
in Budapest on spying charges.
   The Soviet line on Wallenberg's death has not changed, von
Dardel told a news conference, but officials are cooperating with
the relatives' search and suggested a trip to the Vladimir prison
Monday to let them check its archives and cells themselves.
   Von Dardel and Wallenberg's half-sister, Nina Lagergren, arrived
in Moscow on Oct. 14 for their officially approved trip. In an
initial meeting, Soviet authorities presented them with
Wallenberg's personal effects, including his blue diplomatic
passport, which they said had just been found among sacks of such
items at KGB headquarters.
   They were also shown a copy of a death certificate that backs up
the Soviet claim that Wallenberg died of heart failure in 1947.
   But von Dardel and Lagergren maintain their belief that
Wallenberg, who would be 77, is still alive.
   Von Dardel said the Vladimir prison used to have a special
section for foreigners and about 20 former prisoners have told
Western investigators ``there was a Swede whose name varied'' but
resembled Wallenberg.
   He said he would travel to the prison and investigate its
records, which go back to 1953, and the cells themselves, but that
he did not expect to find Wallenberg there because the foreigners'
section is gone.
   Lagergren said it was moving just to visit Moscow and the KGB's
Lubyanka prison, where Wallenberg was held.
   ``You can imagine what it feels like to pass through the
Lubyanka prison and think that Raoul has been there beginning in
1945,'' she said. ``And that he was there for two years, not far
away from the Swedish embassy, without being able to contact
anybody outside prison. And we didn't know.''
   Soviet authorities investigated the relatives' list of people
who believed they had seen Wallenberg with ``remarkable quickness''
and resolved many points, but not all, von Dardel said.
   A Soviet official who met with the Wallenberg relatives said
Friday they would continue to be welcome to search for his traces,
but they could not expect to find him alive.
   ``The Soviet side has confirmed that the fact of Wallenberg's
death is irrevocable and nothing more can be done here,'' Foreign
Ministry official Nikolai Uspensky said.

   Farmers mailed 8,400 sugar beets to

   Georges Thevoz, president of one of Switzerland's two main

   Organizers said the form of the protest was chosen partly to

   On Oct. 2, the government rejected beet farmers' demands for a
10 percent increase in prices to counter a bumper crop this year.

is ``no basis whatsoever'' to a published report that he engaged in
sexual misconduct in the House gym and predicted that any ethics
committee investigation would support his denial.
   The Washington Times reported Friday that the ethics committee
has evidence of sexual misconduct by Frank and several other
members in the gym, located in the sub-basement of the Rayburn
House Office Building.
   ``The allegations in the Washington Times today that I engaged
in improper activities in the House gym are completely untrue,''
Frank said in a statement issued by his office.
   ``There is simply no basis whatsoever for any suggestions to the
contrary and I am confident that the ethics committee will concur.''
   Gym supervisor Dennis Fogle, asked if he was aware of any
misconduct in the gym, said, ``not to my knowledge.'' He said the
gym is for members only and there are no provisions he is aware of
for members to bring guests there with them.
   A source in the speaker's office, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said no allegations of misconduct in the gym have been
brought to the attention of the speaker of the House, Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash.
   One ethics committee source, who also spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the full panel has not held discussions on the
subject during its investigation of Frank.
   The newspaper, which said it could not ascertain the names of
any of the other congressmen, said it learned of the evidence from
several members close to the ethics investigation. These sources
were not named.
   The Times quoted a male prostitute, Stephen Gobie, as saying he
and Frank had performed sex acts ``on a couple of occasions'' after
hours in the House gym. The newspaper said it had confirmed that
Frank had brought ``a number of young men'' to the gym, which
generally is off-limits to the public and to staff.
   The paper said the ethics panel had determined that several
congressmen had taken male and female guests into the gym ``for
illicit sexual activity.''
   The ethics committee has been investigating Frank's conduct
since Gobie revealed his 1985-1987 relationship with the
congressman to the Times.

   Mickey Mouse is coming back to the Soviet Union,
this time in the form of comic books.
   According to a report Friday in the newspaper Trud, the Walt
Disney character will appear in Russian language comic books
published by a Soviet-Danish joint venture.
   The comic will be issued four times a year by the Soviet
publisher of Physical Culture and Sports and Guttenberghus, an
international subsidiary of Disney, Trud said. It will have a
print-run of 200,000 and cost about $2.
   One year ago, Mickey, in the form of a costumed Disney employee,
came to the Soviet Union to celebrate his 60th birthday and have a
``summit meeting'' with Misha the Bear, the mascot of the 1980
Moscow Olympics.
   The joint venture ends the copyright problems that previously
prevented Mickey and his cartoon friends from appearing in the
Soviet Union in films and comics.

   Nineteen illegal Burmese

Immigration Department spokesman said Friday.
   A man, six women and 12 children were arrested in Klang, about
18 miles west of Kuala Lumpur, on Tuesday and deported Thursday,
the spokesman told the National News Agency Bernama.
   Some of the children had been deported once before, and
authorities believe a local syndicate has been bringing them in
through Thailand to beg and then collect the money from them, the
spokesman said.
   Any Malaysian caught bringing them in would be fined $3,800 or
jailed for five years, he said.

   The Senate today approved impeachment charges
against U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami, ousting him
from the federal bench for conspiring to obtain a $150,000 payoff.
   Hastings' fate was sealed on the first of 17 articles of
impeachment, when the Senate voted 69-26 to convict him of
conspiracy, more than the two-thirds margin required.
   In two hours of back-to-back roll calls, the Senate convicted
Hastings on eight articles, acquitted him on three and waived votes
on the other six counts.
   Hastings, the first black federal district judge in Florida, was
removed from the bench even though he had been acquitted in 1983 in
a criminal trial.
   Maintaining his innocence after the vote, he said he intends to
run for governor of Florida and resume the practice of law.
   ``I'm upbeat and can go forward with my life ...,'' he told
reporters. ``There are those of you who would say I should be
banished in infamy. I know nothing in my life that requires that.''
   The Senate also voted to convict Hastings on seven subsequent
charges that included perjury. The Senate voted 48-47 and 60-35 in
favor of two allegations, but the tallies were short of the
two-thirds needed for conviction. In the other acquittal, it voted
95-0 to clear Hastings of a charge he improperly disclosed wiretap
information.
   The voting over, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., announced from the
presiding officer's chair:
   ``The Senate having tried Alcee L. Hastings, United States
District judge for the Southern District of Florida upon 17 of the
articles of impeachment exhibited against him by the House of
Representatives and two-thirds of the Senate having found him
guilty ... it is therefore ordered that the said Alcee L. Hastings
be and is hereby removed from office.''
   Hastings was the sixth federal official removed as a result of
impeachment.
   Flanked by his attorneys, the 53-year-old judge watched the
proceedings from a table on the floor of the Senate as one by one
the lawmakers answered the roll call. He left the chamber a few
minutes after the first of the articles was voted.
   Hastings' problems began on Oct. 9, 1981, when his friend,
Washington, D.C., attorney William Borders was arrested in an
undercover operation of alleged fixing of court cases. Borders was
convicted of bribery conspiracy, but Hastings was acquitted in a
separate 1983 jury trial.
   However, a subsequent investigation led to Hastings' impeachment
last year in the House, which accused him of plotting to obtain a
bribe, lying during his trial and an unrelated charge of improperly
disclosing federal wiretap information.
   Borders served a prison term in the case and currently is in
jail on contempt charges for refusing to testify in the impeachment
trial after being granted immunity from prosecution.
   ``I have no choice but to accept their judgment,'' Hastings said
after the vote in a statement that criticized the proceedings as
unjust.
   ``In my opinion their judgment is void of the wisdom of the
forefathers teachings regarding impeachment,'' Hastings said. He
said the case ``gives new meaning to double jeopardy and renders a
severe blow to the cornerstone of justice _ the jury system.''
   ``What the Senate has said is a standard of almost proven,
innuendo and inference is good enough to remove a judge or
executive officer by way of impeachment,'' he said. ``That is
chilling and fraught with potential to do a lot of harm.''
   The Senate impeachment trial was not a criminal proceeding.
Thus, Hastings stands removed as a judge but remains a free man
without any criminal record.
   Hastings said he was ``hopeful that some book offers will come
along.''
   ``There are so many wonderful and tragic stories that are born
of this saga. They need to be told and tell them I shall,'' he said.
   Senators sat silently at their desks as the roll was called.
   When the first tally was announced, defense attorney Terence J.
Anderson showed the roll call to Hastings, who then offered his
hand and shook hands firmly with the lawyer.
   The Senate acted after a seven-hour, closed-door session
Thursday night that found it divided over the charges.
   Hastings has been proclaiming his innocence for eight years, and
while he won some converts, it was short of what he needed for
acquittal in the Senate.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., on Thursday became the first senator
to reveal his position, saying in a 76-page paper he would vote for
acquittal.
   Specter said that after ``weighing the incriminating
circumstantial inferences against the exonerating factors and
giving due weight to his other unblemished lifetime record, I
conclude there is insufficient evidence to convict'' Hastings of
the bribery conspiracy charge.
   He said it was clear that prosecutors told jurors at the 1983
trial that Hastings lied in denying his guilt.
   ``Obviously, the jury did not accept those arguments,'' said
Specter, who served as district attorney of Philadelphia for eight
years.
   He said the allegation that Hastings improperly disclosed
wiretap information, in which Dade County, Fla., Mayor Steve Clark
was a key witness, ``was neither convincing nor substantial.''
   ``While there was direct evidence in the testimony of Mayor
Clark, a number of factors made Mayor Clark a less than wholly
credible witness,'' Specter said.

<HEAD>Inter-Korea Sports Talks Make Breakthrough: A Flag Design</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sports officials from North Korea and
South Korea on Friday announced their first breakthrough in
months-old talks on the Asian Games: they agreed on a flag to be
used by athletes from both nations.
   Progress also was reported on plans to form a single team for
the games next year in Beijing, but obstacles remain, such as what
to call the team.
   ``There was a considerable progress on the flag and others,
including the selection of athletes for the joint team,'' North
Korea's chief delegate Kim Hyung Jin said after the four-hour
meeting at the Panmunjom truce site.
   ``We will do our best to form the first single team in our
history and we in turn expect the South to do so,'' he said.
   His South Korean counterpart, Chang Chung-sik, also reported
progress.
   ``The northern side was rather active and straightforward and
there was some progress. But I would not say the prospect is 100
percent bright,'' Chang said after the meeting, which was open to
the press.
   The talks were businesslike, with both sides avoiding political
exchanges. Recent talks have bogged down in acrimonious political
exchanges.
   Sports officials of the two Koreas met twice early this year
before North Korea unilaterally suspended dialogue in April to
protest the arrest of South Korean dissident clergyman Moon
Ik-hwan. Moon was arrested for visiting North Korea without
permission from the South Korean government.
   North Korea has been demanding Moon's release, but North Korean
officials did not raise the issue Friday.
   Delegates of the two Koreas quickly agreed on a flag to be used
by the first inter-Korea joint team at the Asian Games. The flag
will have a map of the Korean peninsula in blue on a white
background.
   It is the first time both Koreas have agreed on a joint flag for
an international sports event since they first started talks on
forming a single team for the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. All efforts
to form a joint team for any event so far have failed.
   Both Koreas also agreed in principle to select athletes for the
single team through joint training and open competition.
   They could not agree on the name of the team. Both sides agreed
to use Korea as the English name of the team but could not decide
what name to use in Korean.
   North Korea proposed Nov. 2 as a date of the next meeting but
South Korea suggested Nov. 22. They settled on Nov. 16.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea in 1945.

impeachment rules to remove Hastings. A two-thirds vote was
required for conviction.
   On this vote, a yes vote was a vote to convict while a no vote
was a vote to acquit.
   Voting yes were 34 Democrats and 35 Republicans.
   Voting no were 21 Democrats and 5 Republicans.

   A security systems owner says he was robbed
at knifepoint by a woman who took about $200, but gave him $20 back
and thanked him for being ``most generous.''
   ``I got a tip for being robbed,'' Charles Grubb said Thursday.
   ``She confronted me with a meat-carving knife,'' said Grubb, 50,
who was returning to his car after dinner in downtown Duluth
Wednesday. ``It looked like a machete. She was extremely nervous.
She told me, `I've used this before, and I wouldn't hesitate to use
it again.'''
   After taking the money and giving some of it back, the woman ran
down an alley, Grubb said.
   A few hours later, police arrested a 24-year-old woman staying
at the downtown YWCA and took her to St. Luke's Hospital for
psychiatric observation. Charges were pending.
   Grubb, who sells security systems for homes and businesses, said
he'll use his experience in his sales pitch.
   ``The message is,'' he said, ``it can happen to anyone.''

   House and Senate negotiators have agreed to
include illegal aliens counted in the 1990 census when
congressional districts are redrawn to account for shifts in
population.
   Under an amendment approved by the Senate, the use of federal
funds would have been prohibited for counting illegal aliens for
the purpose of congressional reapportionment.
   A House-Senate conference committee, however, voted Thursday to
drop the Senate amendment when it approved appropriations for the
judiciary and the Commerce, State and Justice departments.
   States with large numbers of illegal aliens such as Texas,
California and Florida could gain new congressional seats as a
result of the decision.
   Inclusion of illegal aliens in the count has been strongly
opposed by legislators with few of those residents who fear loss of
influence in Congress.
   ``The outcome was never in doubt because the Constitution could
not be clearer. The Constitution says that apportionment is based
on the number of persons and everybody is entitled to their own
opinion, but not their own constitution,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, a member of the conference committee.
   Illegal aliens have always been counted in the census because of
the requirement to include all persons living in the country.
Census Bureau officials have pointed out that they would have no
way to exclude illegal aliens, since citizenship is not asked in
the national head count.
   The issue of counting illegal aliens has pitted Sun Belt states,
whose populations have been swollen by illegal aliens, against
Frostbelt states that stand to lose House seats after the census.

<HEAD>British Airways Won't Join New Bid for United Airlines</HEAD>

   British Airways PLC said today it was pulling out
of a group attempting to buy UAL Corp., dealing a heavy blow to
plans by the U.S. company's management and employees to acquire the
parent of United Airlines.
   Last week, the group's announcement that it was unable to
finance its planned $6.75 billion buyout triggered a nosedive by
the New York Stock Exchange that roiled markets worldwide.
   Since then, the group and its advisers have been seeking
financial backing for a revised offer at a lower price.
   UAL stock, which has taken a pounding since the group's Oct. 13
announcement, took another dive in early trading today on the New
York Stock Exchange. UAL was down $21.12{ a share at $169 at
midday, bringing its decline so far this week to about $110.
   British Airways as late as last weekend indicated it was
confident a revised buyout plan could be arranged. But in recent
days company officials have indicated that British Air was not
necessarily wedded to a deal.
   British Airways issued a brief statement today saying it ``does
not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of
UAL in the foreseeable future.''
   After banks refused to back the original UAL deal, the buyout
group led by management and United pilots scaled down its original
$300 a share offer to $5.62 billion, or $250 a share. UAL officials
have been in Tokyo this week, trying to win support for the revised
offer from big Japanese banks.
   United is the second-largest U.S. airline after American
Airlines. The deal, if successful, would be the largest
employee-led buyout of a U.S. company.
   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for Chicago-based UAL, said the company
had no comment on the action by British Airways.
   Last weekend, British Airways issued a statement saying it was
confident a revised financing package would be arranged and the bid
would be allowed to proceed. On Monday, the company confirmed it
was pursuing the bid with Airlines Acquisition Corp., the
management-led group that also includes United pilots.
   A British Airways spokesman, who was not identified, in
accordance with British custom, said he could not comment beyond
the prepared statement, which gave no indication of why British
Airways backed out or when the decision was made.
   Under the original offer, British Airways would have provided
$750 million, or about three-quarters of the equity, for the
leveraged buyout and would have received a 15 percent stake in the
airline.

   Ronald and Nancy Reagan arrived here Friday on a
visit for which the former president reportedly will receive $2
million, and the Japanese government said it will award him one of
its highest honors.
   The Reagans arrived on a chartered TWA Boeing 747 along with 229
U.S. military dependents they invited to hitch a ride to the Far
East.
   Reagan will receive the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the
Chrysanthemum for his ``contribution to the maintenance and
promotion of friendship between the United States and Japan,'' said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   ``Mr. Reagan has always been clear in refusing protectionism and
tried his best to maintain the free trade system,'' Watanabe said.
   The only other U.S. president to receive the honor was Dwight
Eisenhower.
   The Reagans are in Japan at the invitation of the Japanese
government and the Fujisankei Communications Group. Fujisankei has
refused to confirm reports Reagan will receive about $2 million for
the visit, which it said will cost a total of about $7 million.
   Fujisankei, Japan's largest media group, owns the newspaper
Sankei Shimbun, the Fuji Telecasting Corp. and Nippon Hoso, Japan's
biggest commercial radio network, among dozens of other companies.
   Like Fujisankei's chairman, Nobutaka Shikanai, many of the
company's media outlets espouse conservativism and nationalism. At
the time of Emperor Hirohito's death and the controversy it spawned
over his role in World War II, the Fuji TV network generally
carried fewer critical views of Japan's imperial system.
   The Reagans descended hand-in-hand from their plane and were met
by U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost and Vice Foreign Minister Naoki
Tanaka.
   In short remarks on the tarmac, Reagan said he was ``delighted''
to be back in Japan. The former president made a state visit to
Japan in 1983 and attended the annual summit of industrialized
nations in Tokyo in 1986.
   ``I deeply valued the working relationships I had with Japanese
leaders during my time in the White House,'' he said. ``Nancy and I
have a special fondness for the Japanese people.''
   The Reagans will attend several charity events and meet Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Emperor Akihito and other government
figures during the two-day official part of the visit.
   The Reagans' chartered jet was half-filled with relatives of
military personnel.
   The wives, children and parents on the plane were greeted by
uniformed family members with tears, hugs and kisses.
   ``It's great. I wasn't expecting to see them until next
February,'' said Pat Andreas of Yokosuka Naval Base, south of
Tokyo, as he tousled the heads of his sons Michael, 7, and Alex, 3,
after they and their mother, Lyn, arrived from Oxnard, Calif.
   ``The Reagans were so friendly and down to earth,'' said Cleo
Bookwalder of Albuquerque, N.M., who traveled with her husband Don
to see their son, Fred, who is stationed in northern Japan, for the
first time in two years.
   The Bookwalders and others said the Reagans spent time on the
jet shaking hands and talking with them.
   ``I want to write to someone in charge to thank them for making
this possible,'' said Sue Abel of Fort Madison, Iowa, as she
greeted her husband's parents, Violet and Bill Abel.
   The Reagans were whisked by helicopter from Tokyo to
Fujisankei's Hakone Open-Air Museum in the forested hills near
Mount Fuji where, after a brief welcoming ceremony, they were to
spend Friday evening and Saturday resting.
   It is Reagan's first major excursion since he had surgery Sept.
8 to drain fluid from his brain after suffering a head injury in a
horseback riding accident this summer.
   The Reagans are scheduled to return to the United States on Oct.
28.

<HEAD>Plane Carrying Equipment for Quake-Ravaged Armenia Crashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cargo plane carrying construction equipment for
earthquake-ravaged Armenia crashed early Friday, killing all 17
people aboard, a newspaper reported.
   The crash near the airport in Leninakan, Armenia, was the second
air disaster in the Caucasus region this week and recalled a
similar disaster in the same area just after December's quake.
   The evening newspaper Izvestia said an Ilyushin-76 on its way to
the Leninakan airport slammed into a mountain 11 miles away. On
board were seven crew members, seven passengers and three
pilot-trainees, it said.
   A government commission was formed to investigate the accident.
   Leninakan is in the heart of the area devastated by the Dec. 7,
1988, earthquake, which killed 25,000 people. Four days after the
quake, an Il-76 carrying Soviet soldiers to help rescue quake
victims plunged to the ground near Leninakan's airport, killing all
78 people on board.
   On Wednesday, one of four engines on an Il-76 caught fire after
takeoff in Azerbaijan and the plane crashed in the Caspian Sea,
killing all 57 people aboard. Among those killed were paratroopers
assigned to keep order in the Caucasus, which has been wracked by
ethnic violence for more than a year.

   Firefighter Lee Kraft was visibly shaken
after he crawled into an 18-inch-high opening on the collapsed
Nimitz Freeway to pull out the bodies of a 6-year-old girl and her
mother.
   ``It kills you. It just kills you. We all have families, you
know. ... The adults are no problem. But the kids ...,'' he said
Thursday before trailing off, dabbing tears.
   The carnage on the highway, also known as Interstate 880, upset
even the most veteran of rescue workers. Here, on a 1\-mile-long
section of interstate just south of the Bay Bridge, Tuesday's
earthquake was its deadliest.
   Using shovels, backhoes, cranes and their hands, workers had
recovered 21 bodies and located 52 vehicles between the pancaked
decks of the highway by early today. Twenty-three of them were
empty, single bodies were removed from nine of them and 20 others
were yet to be investigated. In addition, 45 cars and trucks were
pulled off the shattered upper deck or from the streets below,
authorities said.
   But 167 people remained on the official missing list today for
Alameda County, which includes Oakland and several other
communities. Dozens of vehicles still were sandwiched between tons
of concrete.
   Early estimates put the number of dead at 250 people, but
officials said Thursday night that they expected the total would be
lower _ possibly much lower.
   Some rescuers, working around the clock, stubbornly clung to
hopes that someone might be found alive in the highway debris.
Others, including Kraft, had no hopes.
   ``We haven't found a live one yet, and I don't think we will,''
he said.
   The even layers of the two-tiered elevated highway lay buckled
and twisted like a writhing serpent, their concrete supports
sheared off.
   On the railing of the flattened upper deck, spray paint pointed
the way to crushed cars and shattered bodies: 1DOA signified a
body, 2MT a pair of empty cars, a circle and arrow with the number
43 stood for a car 43 feet away.
   ``You could see blood splattered everywhere on the concrete,''
said volunteer Jason Losorio, taking a break after a 13-hour shift
that included moving concrete chunks by hand.
   The scene drew hundreds of onlookers on Thursday, including many
who feared a relative or friend might be buried.
   During a live broadcast of CBS-TV's ``48 Hours,'' an angry man
who believes his son may be in the wreckage confronted Mayor Lionel
Wilson.
   ``Mayor, did you know that you are directly responsible for this
here mess, this disaster?'' asked Daniel Rubi of San Francisco.
Rubi said he had been turned away on Wednesday when he asked to
climb the freeway structure and search for his son, Juan.
   The mayor replied, ``I'm sorry, I can't answer that question.''
   Police took Rubi away but did not place him under arrest.
   Authorities say it could be at least three days before workers
reach all the trapped vehicles, thereby getting an accurate count.
After that, the highway will be demolished.
   Rumors of survivors periodically swept through the crowds of
rescue workers, reporters and bystanders _ only to be knocked down
by officials each time.
   Wednesday night brought reports that a rescuer had touched a
live human hand in the wreckage. It was a false alarm.
   Losorio said he sneaked in, without permission, between the
levels Wednesday night and spotted the forms of four or five people
in their mangled vehicles.
   They may have been unconscious, he said. But he left because of
the danger, and he agreed with rescue leaders' caution about
sending workers into dangerous sections.
   ``All that might happen is someone else would get hurt,'' he
said.
   A burly carpenter who declined to give his name said he had seen
incredible bravery by his fellow carpenters and ironworkers.
   ``I saw people crawling in there in places where they weren't
sure a branch was holding them up, running torches in places they
weren't sure there was gas because they had to. ...
   ``Four carpenters worked 'til 2 this morning and went to their
regular jobs at 7 and they'll be back tonight,'' he said. ``We're
here just because we believe in it.''

<HEAD>South Africa Declaration Completed; Britain Dissents on Sanctions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Commonwealth foreign ministers
completed a draft declaration Friday on South Africa, with Britain
dissenting about sanctions, diplomats reported.
   Officials also worked on an environment statement after the
leaders of Commonwealth nations left for a weekend retreat on
Langkawi Island. Diplomats said differences remained on India's
proposal for an new enviornmental fund, which Britain opposes.
   ``On South African sanctions, we've agreed to disagree,'' a
Canadian official said privately. No details were released.
   Commonwealth leaders were to consider both drafts at Langkawi,
where they settled into luxury two-bedroom chalets at a beach hotel
210 miles northwest of here in the Straits of Malacca.
   Young Malaysian women dressed in sarongs greeted the leaders of
the 49-nation grouping of Britain and its former colonies, who
arrived at the resort in the rain with their spouses. Police and
soldiers guarded the hotel.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan also took her baby
son, Bilawal Asif, and his governess.
   A 10-nation committee of foreign ministers, including John Major
of Britain, met late into the night refining the draft on South
Africa.
   Diplomats said it incorporated an Australian proposal to
increase financial pressure on the white authorities that Britain,
the sole opponent of sanctions, refused to accept.
   Representatives of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
said the draft ``also recognizes a sense of change in South Africa
and the need to look at how to set negotiations in train.''
   Mrs. Thatcher told the summit F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's new
president, should be encouraged in his moves toward reform.
   Australia countered that pressure should be maintained as long
as South Africa continued apartheid, the policy of race
discrimination that enables the 5 million whites to maintain
supremacy over 28 million blacks.
   Its proposal would withhold pressure on trade for for about six
months to give de Klerk time to deliver on promises of reform.
   South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961.
   On the environment, Mrs. Thatcher rejected India's proposal for
a fund and said all resources should be channeled through the U.N.
World Environmental Program.
   Many other delegations also expressed reservations about a new
fund.

   The Army charged two soldiers with
negligent homicide for using too much powder in an artillery round
that strayed and killed three soldiers last month, officials said
today.
   Sgt. Edward C. Tyler, 26, of Washington, D.C., and Spec.
Nickoles W. Holly, 24, of Canton, Ohio, were told Wednesday that
they were being charged in military court with negligent homicide
and dereliction of duty through negligence, said Sheila Samples, a
spokeswoman at Fort Sill.
   The stray round struck near 80 soldiers on a rifle range outside
the target area and injured 24 as well as killing three.
   Tyler, a howitzer battery section chief, and Holly, a No. 2
cannoneer, are accused of using too much powder, which caused the
105mm howitzer round to land outside the designated impact area,
the Army said.
   Ms. Samples said the two were not in confinement and were still
performing their duties with C Battery, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Field
Artillery at Fort Sill. She said, however, that they were not
firing cannons.
   Ms. Samples said that if the Fort Sill commander, Maj. Gen.
Raphael J. Hallada, convenes a general court-martial and the men
are convicted of both charges, the maximum sentence would be a bad
conduct discharge and 15 months confinement with loss of pay and
allowances.

   The Bush administration has decided to forbid
American citizens from having financial dealings with Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega as well as more than 30 firms in which he
has an interest, officials said today.
   Many of these businesses serve as intermediaries in trade
between the United States and Cuba, which has been illegal since
1960, the sources said.
   The move serves to tighten the embargo against Cuba and also to
penalize Panamanian firms controlled by Noriega and his wife, said
the administration officials, who asked not to be identified.
   Americans who violate the new measure, scheduled to be announced
next week, could face fines of up to $500,000, according to the
officials.
   The step was first reported by the Los Angeles Times. Asked
about the report, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
refused comment.
   The administration has been groping for ways to punish Noriega
without further damaging the Panamanian economy, which has declined
steeply over the past 18 months as a result of earlier sanctions
imposed by the United States.
   Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez today renewed
his call for the departure of Noriega but said he opposes any U.S.
military move to achieve that goal.
   Winding up a two-day visit with a news conference, Gonzalez
praised President Bush's decision not to use force in helping rebel
officers in their bid to oust Noriega two weeks ago.
   ``Interventionism is never desirable,'' Gonzalez said through a
translator. ``I'm very pleased to know that it has not happened.''
   Gonzalez has offered some ideas for resolving Panama's crisis
but he acknowledged that a solution cannot be achieved by third
countries.
   ``It should be a Panamanian solution; otherwise there will be no
solution,'' he said.
   Gonzalez spoke to reporters at Blair House after conferring
Thursday night with Bush on the Panama situation. Today, he gave
few details of the exchange and declined to characterize Bush's
position.
   Following an earlier meeting, Bush called Spain a model for
Eastern European nations to follow in their moves toward democratic
reforms.
   Bush praised Spain's involvement in the European Community and
the 24-nation group that is providing economic assistance to Poland
and Hungary. He also noted Spain's own move from dictatorship to
democracy.
   Gonzalez's idea for removing Noriega involves electing a new
Panamanian president who would have the power to name a new
military commander to replace Noriega. In contrast to Bush's stated
wish, the proposal would not require that Noriega return to the
United States to face a drug-trafficking indictment.
   Raymond Seitz, assistant secretary of state for European and
Canadian Affairs, said the U.S. position has not changed. Asked if
the administration was flexible, however, he said, ``Sure.''
   Privately, another administration official said the primary U.S.
goal is to get Noriega out of power, while the secondary goal is to
try him on the drug case.
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration said Thursday it may speed up
the planned withdrawal of U.S. military dependents from Panama.
   Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, the newly appointed U.S. military
commander in Panama, also has recommended shortening soldiers' tour
of duty so that fewer bring their families to Panama, a Pentagon
official said.
   Bush, Gonzalez and top advisers discussed a range of issues,
including economic and political reforms in Poland and Hungary, the
upcoming elections in Nicaragua, international anti-drug efforts
and their roles in the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, said Seitz.
   Bush had warm words for Spain despite the rough patch in
U.S.-Spanish relations that had occurred until last year when the
United States agreed to reduce its military presence in the
southern European nation.
   Spain insisted that the United States remove a group of F-16
fighter planes based in the country. Italy agreed to accept them.
   The United States still has a military presence in Spain that
represents ``the maturing of the defense relationship'' between the
two countries, Seitz said.

   A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive
pleaded guilty today to charges he participated in a scheme to
bribe a Navy official as part of an effort to get a lucrative
electronics contract.
   Frank J. Lavelle, 68, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bribery
in connection with payment of $400,000 to Garland L. Tomlin, Jr., a
former Navy procurement official.
   Lavelle, a former marketing director for Sperry's Clearwater,
Fla., facility, faces a possible 20-year prison sentence and fines
of $30,000 for his involvement in the bribery scheme that included
another Sperry official and a defense consultant for the company.
   Tomlin, 59, has already pleaded guilty to charges he took
$400,000 from Sperry and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc. to provide
confidential bid information on a multimillion-dollar contract for
maintaining electronic components of Navy weapons.
   Lavelle admitted that he introduced Tomlin to Charles F.
Gardner, a former Sperry executive on Long Island, N.Y., who has
also pleaded guilty to charges arising from his role in the
Pentagon procurement scandal.
   Lavelle told Gardner that Tomlin wanted a ``nest egg'' for his
retirement. Gardner obtained permission from another official of
Sperry to approve the payments.
   The money was funneled to an offshore account that Tomlin kept
in the Bahamas by James G. Neal, a consultant who worked for
Sperry, which became part of the Unisys Corp. following a merger
with Burroughs Corp.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled Lavelle's sentencing
for Jan. 12, 1990.
   Former Unisys marketing executive Dennis Mitchell, 42, meanwhile
received a 90-day sentence in a halfway house for his guilty plea
to participate in a scheme to pay $4,000 in illegal campaign
contributions to several members of Congress.
   Mitchell was also placed on two years' probation and ordered to
perform 100 hours of community service.
   The contributions were funneled through Unisys consultants at
the direction of Gardner to various House members involved in
defense appropriations. They included Congressmen Les Aspin, the
Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the House Armed Services Committee.

<TEXT>
   A computer failure at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport disrupted tower operations for at least 12
hours, leaving controllers with a ``real problem with confidence,''
a union leader said.
   Air traffic at the nation's second busiest airport was disrupted
for the second time in a week Thursday when a computer from the
1950s failed to operate properly, Federal Aviation Administration
officials said.
   The failure forced officials to limit the number of planes in
and out of the airport each hour and to call in veteran controllers
to help. The computer was restored to full service at about 2:30
a.m. today, said Larry Parrent, assistant air traffic manager.
   It was the second outage in a week. On Saturday, when air
traffic was heavy because of the Texas-Oklahoma football game, a
technician mistakenly tried to program a radar computer from the
wrong terminal causing an outage that left controllers uncertain
for 19 minutes about the location of airplanes in the area, FAA
officials said.
   ``There is a real problem with confidence in the system,''
Milton Sherotter, president of the Dallas airport's controllers
union, told The Fort Worth Star Telegram. ``You come in here from
day to day and you never know when something is going to happen.''
   New equipment is not expected for another three to five years,
officials said.
   ``It's not really aggravating but it's frustrating when you
can't get new equipment in at a timely fashion to deal with the
demands the private sector puts on you,'' Parrent said.

   The setting was Westminster Abbey, but the event
was pure theater as Britain's finest actors paid tribute Friday to
Laurence Olivier and listened to ``Henry V'' spoken by the master
himself.
   The tape-recording of the St. Crispin's Day speech from
Shakespeare's play highlighted a ceremony of music, poetry and
thanksgiving for the awesome talent of Olivier, who died July 11 at
82.
   ``There may be imitators but there is no second Olivier,'' said
Sir Alec Guinness, eulogist at a ceremony brimming with eloquence,
affection and a who's who of theatrical greats among the
congregation of 2,000.
   Guinness was joined by fellow acting knights John Gielgud, John
Mills, and Dame Peggy Ashcroft in reciting from Shakespeare, the
Bible, John Milton and John Donne.
   Olivier's widow, actress Joan Plowright, sat in the front row,
flanked by family members.
   A theatrical procession to the high altar began with Douglas
Fairbanks Jr., carrying Olivier's Order of Merit insignia. Next was
Michael Caine, holding his late colleague's honorary Academy Award
from 1979.
   Others in the pageant were Derek Jacobi, Ian McKellen, Frank
Finlay, Maggie Smith, Dorothy Tutin, Paul Scofield, and Peter
O'Toole. Albert Finney read from Ecclesiastes.
   ``For 60 years he moved, astonished and teased his public. He
could interpret human nature at its noblest, at its most comic and
at its most pitiable,'' said the Dean of Westminster, the Very Rev.
Michael Mayne, who conducted the service.
   Guinness' address was witty, elegant, anecdotal and moving. Eyes
moistened as the 75-year-old actor quoted from ``Hamlet'':
   ``Good night, sweet prince,
   ``And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.''
   Guinness said Olivier ``stands alongside the acknowledged great:
Burbage, Betterton, Garrick, Kean and Irving.
   ``Even allowing for violent changes of fashion, I feel that each
of those tremendous actors of the past would have recognized his
style, applauded him and welcomed him as one of their own.''
   ``Great,'' a much-abused word, readily applied to Olivier,
Guinness said. ``Perhaps it consists of a happy combination of
imagination, physical magnetism, a commanding and appealing voice,
an expressive eye _ and danger.''
   Ashcroft, 81, Olivier's classmate at the Central School of
Drama, recited passages from Milton's poem ``Lycidas'' with
piercing grace and beauty.
   As the Gothic church windows glistened in noon sunshine,
Gielgud, 85, flooded Westminster Abbey with his beautiful voice,
reading John Donne's famous sonnet that begins ``Death be not
proud.''
   Among the guests was Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth II's
youngest son. Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe represented
the government.
   Alexander Cohen and his wife, Hildy Parks, represented Broadway
and the Actors' Fund in the United States.
   Lord Olivier, as he became with his ennoblement in 1970, was
cremated at a family funeral in southern England. His ashes will be
laid to rest in Westminster Abbey next year.
   Afterward, actor Jack Lemmon said: ``The service was not too
downbeat. I enjoyed it very much.''
   Jacobi said Olivier would have liked the service. ``He'd have
been outside the Abbey around the front counting the takings,'' he
chuckled.
   McKellen said it was ``a solemn, happy occasion ... full of
wonderful traditions and music.''
   Discussion of potential heirs was quickly dismissed, with
Guinness' eulogy setting the tone: ``Sometimes we read in the press
of a young actor being hailed as a `second Olivier.' That is
nonsense of course. ... He was unique.''
   Echoed Michael York: ``There will never, never be another
Olivier.''

<HEAD>A New Top Ticket Price for Broadway Musicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadway musicals are getting more upscale _
tickets at a Tony award-winner now cost a tony $60.
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' boosted its ticket prices Thursday,
jumping $5 from a $55 top for its best orchestra and choice
mezzanine seats.
   Until February, when ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' opened, the
top ticket price, was $50. But such long running hits as ``Les
Miserables,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' and ``Me and My Girl,''
quietly followed ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' raising their prices
from $50 to $55 over the last few weeks.
   Many of the big incoming musicals for this season including ``3
Penny Opera'' with rock singer Sting, Tommy Tune's ``Grand Hotel,''
and ``Annie 2'' will have a $55 top.
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' cost an estimated $8.7 million to
produce. Because of its large cast _ more than 50 dancers and
singers _ it operating expenses are $420,000 a week, the highest on
Broadway. It has been grossing around $530,000 each week, but will
have to play more than 70 weeks at capacity to earn back that high
production cost.
   A $55 top ticket price also has been announced for ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' starring Dustin Hoffman, the highest price
ever for a non-musical. It begins a 12-week run in New York on Dec.
4.
   ``Orpheus Descending,'' the hit revival of the Tennessee
Williams play starring Vanessa Redgrave, raises its ticket price
from $42.50 to $45, beginning with performances of Nov. 21. Most
other plays on Broadway are charging $40 or $42.50 for their best
seats.

   Will lofty prices for California real estate
tumble along with the roadways, bridges and homes devastated by
this week's quake? Don't bet the house on it, especially in the
eternally optimistic Golden State.
   ``I've been here for over 60 years, and I've been through them
all including the 1933 earthquake (that hit Long Beach), and that
was a bummer,'' said Thelma Orloff of the Fred Sands brokerage in
Los Angeles, who listed Joan Collins' house at $6 million and
Lucille Ball's at $6.9 million.
   ``But an earthquake takes, what, 15 seconds? And then it's over
for 30 years. And if you're fortunate your foundation is safe and
your house is safe,'' she said. ``And if you're taking earthquake
insurance and the house is destroyed, then you rebuild.''
   Prices, meanwhile, ``just keep going up and up,'' Ms. Orloff
said.
   Experts in San Francisco said some multimillion-dollar deals for
office buildings have been put on hold while damage inspections are
made and prices of homes may drop briefly because of the Northern
California quake.
   But those effects will be temporary, they suggested,
particularly because severe damage is limited to a few older areas,
roadways and bridges. Even in San Francisco's Marina district,
devastation was limited to eight square blocks of old homes built
on landfill _ perhaps one-tenth of the district itself.
   ``You hate to say it's not devastated that much, but there's
only small pockets that have been substantially damaged in the
city,'' San Francisco Realtors Association President Victor Makras
said Friday.
   ``No one's phone is ringing to buy today. Everyone is working
with their present buyers to educate and comfort them,'' Makras
said. ``But I think that once the city services are back and up and
rolling, we will be back to a similar situation to what we had.''
   Prices will intimidate people more than earthquakes in the long
run, said California Association of Realtors spokesman Joel Singer.
   In August, just 10 percent of the households in the Bay Area
could afford the area's median-priced home of $272,016, as
calculated by a realty board ``affordability index,'' which among
other things assumes a 20 percent down payment, average loan rate
and a 30-year loan.
   Harold A. Ellis, the chairman and chief executive of San
Francisco-based Grubb &amp; Ellis, a major national broker for
commercial and residential real estate, said deals would be delayed
while buyers and lenders assess potential damages.
   But Ellis said San Francisco's commercial real estate market had
been picking up since spring, buoyed by a general upturn in the
area's economy, and he and Makras predict that trend will continue.
   ``I think memories will be very short,'' Ellis said.

<HEAD>Pravda Gets New Editor: Gorbachev Aide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The millions of Soviets who see the world through
the gray pages of the Communist Party daily Pravda were told Friday
their newspaper had a new chief: a reformist philosopher and top
aide to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The appointment of Ivan T. Frolov as Pravda's editor seems to
consolidate the Soviet president's grip on the flagship party
daily, which has noticeably lagged behind other official newspapers
in printing the sort of eye-opening criticism encouraged by the
Kremlin's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or more openness.
   As Pravda's circulation has sagged to 9.3 million, that of more
feisty publications such as Ogonyok and Arguments and Facts has
soared. Thus, the influence on public opinion of the party's most
authoritative newspaper was visibly on the wane.
   A joke shows the current popular view of the newspaper, which
was founded by Vladimir I. Lenin in 1912 as an instrument to
overthrow the Russian czar, and whose name means ``truth.''
   ``There's no truth in Izvestia,'' goes the joke, referring to
the Soviet government's evening paper whose name means ``news.''
And, the joke continues, ``there's no news in Pravda.''
   Frolov, 60, erstwhile editor of the party theoretical monthly
journal Kommunist, replaces Viktor G. Afanasyev, a white-haired
holdover from the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev, Sovie leader from 1964
to 1982. Afanasyev, 66, had served as Pravda's editor-in-chief for
13 years.
   Western sources identify the Russian-born graduate of Moscow
University's Philosophy Department as Gorbachev's personal adviser
on ideological matters. Frolov is also reputed to be the country's
top biomedical ethicist and in the 1960s criticized Stalin's
henchman, biologist Trofim Lysenko, for waging an ideological
witchhunt against colleagues that led to the exile, torture and
death of many talented scientists.
   In the 1970s, Frolov reportedly fell from favor because of his
reformist views. He was rehabilitated after Gorbachev became Soviet
leader in 1985.
   Frolov's latest appointment was made by the ruling party
Politburo and announced by Pravda in a page one report on the
Politburo's Thursday meeting. The report was also read on state-run
TV Thursday night.
   A Pravda worker said Friday that Frolov had not yet started
work. Gorbachev was expected to go to the paper's headquarters _ on
Pravda Street in northwest Moscow _ to present Frolov personally to
the staff, the worker said.
   Afanasyev, the No. 1 journalist in the Soviet pecking order by
virtue of his position as Pravda's chief editor and chairman of the
official Union of Journalists, had spoken out for glasnost, once
complaining there were still ``restricted zones'' where coverage
wasn't permitted.
   But he still favored keeping government processes under strong
Communist Party control, rejected the notion that there should be
competing political parties, and warned against allowing criticism
of Communist policy to go too far.
   His clout as Pravda editor was considerable: he once revealed he
was allowed to attend Politburo meetings. But under his tutelage,
Pravda printed the same terse Tass bulletins on the Politburo's
doings that appear in every other Soviet paper, and little more.
   Frolov has been working as an assistant to Gorbachev, the
party's general secretary, Tass said in a brief biographical note.
In that post, Soviet sources say, he helped author a major change
in the philosophical underpinnings of Kremlin foreign policy.
   For decades, the Soviets were ideologically committed to aiding
the worldwide class struggle, but in 1987, presumably due to
Gorbachev's impetus, they proclaimed instead their adherence to
``universal human values,'' meaning they would cooperate with
regimes once regarded as enemies.
   Frolov, a doctor of philosophical sciences, headed the journal
Questions of Philosophy in 1986-77 and has been chairman of the
nation's Philosophical Society since 1987, the same year he became
an aide to Gorbachev.
   He served as chief editor of Kommunist in 1986-87, watershed
years in the elaboration of party doctrine when the Gorbachev-era
policies of ``glasnost'' and ``perestroika,'' or reconstruction,
were being hammered out and put to practical use.
   According to Tass, Frolov also wrote a book along with another
top party official fated to become a Gorbachev adviser, Vadim
Zagladin, titled ``Global Problems of Our Times: Scientific and
Global Aspects.''
   Frolov is a member of the party's policy-making Central
Committee and its Ideological Commission, and a member of the
prestigious Soviet Academy of Sciences department of law and
philosophy. He also has a seat in the new Soviet parliament, the
Congress of People's Deputies.
   Western references report Frolov was a philosophy student at
Moscow State University in 1953, the same period the future Raisa
Gorbachev was enrolled there to study the same subject. Gorbachev,
the son of a southern Russian peasant, was in the university's law
school at the time.

   A fire in a 21-story high-rise today shut the
local offices of the state's courts and the state attorney general
just days after a major earthquake closed those same offices in San
Francisco.
   The fire was limited to an unoccupied machinery room on top of
the building, but other offices were closed while firefighters
inspected the building, said city Fire Department spokesman Greg
Acevedo.
   More than 250 firefighters battled the blaze, which broke out
about 12:35 a.m. and was doused about 40 minutes later, Acevedo
said.
   Three helicopters transported crews to the roof of the building
where firefighters gained control of the blaze from above, he said.
   ``The firefighters on the roof obviously played a big role in
putting the fire out because the building was tall,'' Acevedo said.
   Firefighters were hampered slightly by work in the building to
remove asbestos insulation, Acevedo said. He said no one was inside
the structure when the fire started and there were no injuries
reported.
   Firefighters were not sure what caused the fire, Acevedo said,
adding that no damage estimate was available.
   The Wilshire district, which includes several high-rise office
buildings, is located a little more than one mile west of downtown.
   On Tuesday, a 6.9-magnitude quake seriously damaged the historic
state office building in San Francisco, making unsafe the offices
of Attorney General John Van de Kamp, the state Supreme Court and
Court of Appeals.

   About 50,000 peasants whose homes were destroyed
by earthquakes prepared Friday to spend a second night outdoors on
the windy north China plain.
   No new deaths were reported Friday, leaving the toll at 29 dead
with more than 150 injured. Many peasants said they survived
because the first quake Wednesday night woke them up and sent them
outdoors. A stronger quake early Thursday brought their homes down.
   Two more strong aftershocks were felt Friday morning.
   ``This was the worst quake we've ever had,'' Liu Rongzhen, a
peasant in Xicaitian Village in Shanxi province, told a Western
reporter. About half the 230 houses in the village, made of mud or
sticks and branches, suffered varying degrees of damage.
   All the homes were destroyed in nearby Bucun, a village of
1,280. Two villagers were killed _ a man and the elderly mother he
was trying to carry to safety.
   The survivors rigged tents of quilts and straw and built small
fires Thursday night, and prepared to do the same Friday night.
   Temperatures in Beijing, 135 miles to the east, have been
dipping below 40 degrees at night with a chill wind. Weather in the
quake-affected area is similar.
   The Ministry of Civil Affairs, in charge of emergency rescue,
refused Friday to answer questions and referred callers to the
International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade.
   There, an official who gave his name only as Xu said 11,000
homes had been destroyed in Shanxi and Hebei provinces, and 50,000
people were homeless. He had no other information.
   Shanxi villagers seemed dazed and unsure about how to begin
rebuilding. ``We just hope that the earthquakes stop,'' Liu said.
   He said he lost his home and most of his possessions, worth a
total of about $800. He and others said it would not be possible to
rebuild their homes before winter sets in, but they had no idea
what they would do for shelter.
   Some victims dug with shovels and poles beneath the mounds of
mud and stone that were their homes, but found little that could be
salvaged. One woman found an unbroken light bulb.
   Someone else found a black and white television, a prized
possession in poor areas such as Shanxi, and set it carefully on a
pile of straw.
   National TV broadcast its first report on the quake and said the
government had set up a special fund of $53,850 for quake aid.
   The television showed boxes of medicine being unloaded from a
pickup truck. An official distributed thick pancakes, a local
staple, from a pile heaped high on the ground.
   The report said more than 1,000 soldiers and medical workers
were sent into the area. Footage shot by Shanxi provincial TV but
not shown on the national news showed doctors in makeshift clinics
treating people with broken bones and badly bloodied heads.
   The national news focused on local officials arriving to inspect
damage, and only briefly showed an adobe home in ruins and doctors
treating a victim. The official media has given little attention to
the quake, perhaps because of continued popular belief that natural
disasters spell out heaven's displeasure with the ruler.
   ``Although losses were heavy, the morale of the masses is
stable,'' the television news said. There has been no announcement
of plans to provide temporary shelter for the homeless or rebuild
the destroyed homes.
   The State Seismology Bureau has said it is unlikely that more
strong aftershocks will hit in the near future.
   The bureau said the Thursday morning quake, which measured 6.1
on the Richter scale, was the strongest to hit northern China since
a 1976 earthquake that leveled most of the northeast city of
Tangshan and killed 240,000 people.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake,
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Tuesday's earthquake in Northern California was measured at 6.9 on
the scale.

   Margaret Thatcher and her husband,
Denis, sipped fruit punch from parrot-shaped pottery mugs while
Benazir Bhutto zipped around on an electric cart with her husband,
Asif Zardari, and their baby son.
   It was the beginning of a weekend break from international
diplomacy for the prime ministers of Britain and Pakistan, who are
attending a summit with other movers and shakers of the 49-nation
Commonwealth.
   National leaders were bedecked with garlands of seashells on
arrival at the plush new resort on Langkawi Island in the Straits
of Malacca, 210 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur, site of the
week-long summit.
   The lush green island, whose name means ``sea eagle and white
rock,'' is the largest of 99 in the Langkawi group near Malaysia's
border with Thailand, where the Indian Ocean meets the straits.
   After the fruit punch, Margaret and Denis Thatcher _ she in a
green dress and white shoes, he in a light gray suit _ were taken
to their chalet in a three-wheeled pedal-powered push chair called
a becak.
   Ms. Bhutto and her family rode in a battery-powered electric
cart normally used for baggage at the Pelangi Beach Resort, which
opened six months ago.
   She got in first and Zardari handed in Bilawal Asif, their son.
Mother and child posed for photographs before they drove off.
   Each government leader was assigned one of the two-bedroom
chalets, which are grouped in the 25-acre complex to resemble a
kampung, or Malay village. The hotel was closed to all but the
dignitaries from the organization of Britain and its former
colonies.
   Buses escorted by police collected them at the airport after the
55-minute flight from Kuala Lumpur to this island of 33,000 people.
The road to the hotel eight miles away, winds past coconut
plantations and rice paddies, was guarded by soldiers posted at
500-yard intervals.
   Friday night's buffet dinner included seven choices of fish,
tropical fruit, prawn fritters, seafood paella and steamed yams.
   A lobby notice board said the movie ``Batman'' and assorted
cartoons were the evening's entertainment.
   Others could contemplate the legend of the lovely Princess
Mahsuri, whose tomb is a tourist attraction.
   Once upon a time, the princess was involved in court intrigue
and sentenced to death after unjust accusations that she was
unfaithful to her husband. Visitors are told she placed a curse on
the island that denied it prosperity for seven generations.

   Comedian Joan Rivers and writer Ben Stein
agreed Friday to settle her $50 million libel lawsuit over his
magazine story alleging she joked about the death of her husband.
   Rivers agreed to drop the lawsuit and Stein agreed to donate
money to charities of her choosing. Richard Grant, Rivers'
publicist, said further details of the settlement will not be
disclosed.
   The Stein story was published in GQ magazine in December 1987.
   The article described ``certain events and conversations prior
to and just after the tragic death of Joan Rivers' husband, Edgar
Rosenberg,'' the statement said.
   Rivers contended the conversations never took place. Stein said
he used sources he believed to be reliable. He said the settlement
is not an admission of wrongdoing.
   Stein and the magazine said they ``sincerely regret any
inadvertent imputation of negative or inappropriate conduct.''

   David and Julie Eisenhower plan to write a
book together about life in their famous political families in 1968.
   The grandson of the late President Eisenhower and the daughter
of former President Nixon said they witnessed political triumph and
tragedy.
   ``This was the time of the onset of the women's movement,
student protests, the Black Panthers and the Weather Underground,''
Mrs. Eisenhower said Wednesday during a lecture. ``My parents were
sitting on top of a great powder keg.''
   Mrs. Eisenhower, 41, said she has vivid memories of the time her
father decided to run for president in 1968. Nixon resigned Aug. 9,
1974, during the Watergate scandal, just 1{ years into his second
term.
   Eisenhower, also 41, already has written a book about his
grandfather, who took Nixon as his vice president in the 1950s. And
Mrs. Eisenhower wrote a book about her mother, Pat Nixon.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor is keeping her notorious white
Rolls-Royce, but another of her cars will go on the auction block
this weekend.
   To be sold is Miss Gabor's 1986 midnight blue Rolls-Royce Silver
Spur, a stablemate of the Corniche she was driving June 14, when a
Beverly Hills police officer stopped her for having expired license
plates.
   ``We know the registration is current on this one,'' said Drew
Donen of Spectrum Auctions.
   Miss Gabor's traffic stop led to her conviction Sept. 29 on
charges of slapping the police officer, driving without a valid
driver's license and having an open container of alcohol in the car.
   Sentencing is set for later this month.
   Miss Gabor's blue Rolls is expected to fetch $75,000 during the
auction, set for Saturday and Sunday.
   The red Jaguar Oakland Athletics' outfielder Jose Canseco was
driving when he was ticketed for speeding during spring training
also will be auctioned.

   Ferdinand Marcos' widow, Imelda, is
willing to compromise with the government if President Corazon
Aquino allows her to return home from exile in Hawaii, a senator
said Friday.
   Sen. Joseph Estrada, who arrived Thursday from Hawaii where he
attended Marcos' funeral, said Mrs. Marcos told him she is willing
to negotiate with the government in exchange for her return to the
Philippines.
   Marcos died Sept. 28 in exile in Hawaii three years after his
ouster in the civilian-military revolt that ended his 20-year rule
and swept Mrs. Aquino to power. Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow
his body or any immediate member of the Marcos family into the
Philippines, citing national security concerns.
   ``She told me that she is willing to compromise (with) whatever
President Aquino wants,'' said Estrada, a member of the Liberal
Party, which supports Mrs. Aquino. ``But compromise with dignity.''
   When asked if compromise meant surrendering the wealth the
Marcoses allegedly stole during Marcos' rule, Estrada replied:
``That's possible.'' He did not elaborate.
   Mrs. Marcos ``should be brought home to face all those charges
and not be convicted without trial,'' Estrada said.
   The Aquino government has filed 35 civil suits against the
Marcoses, accusing them of stealing up to $10 billion in public
funds. Mrs. Aquino has said she will not speak to Mrs. Marcos until
the money is returned.
   Estrada, who served as a mayor of a Manila suburb during the
Marcos administration, said Mrs. Marcos wanted to be present during
embezzlement trials against the Marcos family.
   Mrs. Marcos also faces racketeering charges in New York and is
free on bail. She denies the charges.

   A former South African government
employee said authorities have set up an intelligence operation
designed to influence the elections in Namibia, a newspaper
reported Friday.
   Officials even told the covert team to find embarrassing
informaton on U.N. officials as part of an effort to ensure that a
black nationalist group does come to power, Susan Dobson was quoted
as saying by the Namibian newspaper.
   Mrs. Dobson quit her job in South Africa's Bureau of Information
and subsequently claimed she had been a spy for the African
National Congress while working for the government.
   She was quoted Friday as saying that her part of her duties with
the Bureau of Information included a campaign to discredit the
South-West Africa People's Organization and the U.N. contingent
that is coordinating Namibia's transition to independence.
   Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator of Namibia,
denied covert activities were being conducted by his office. He
said the Bureau of Information was involved in telling the public
about election procedures and that the South African government
provided additional staff for that purpose.
   However, a U.N. official said authorities with the world body
believe a covert smear campaign might exist.
   ``I would have to confess (the report) did not take us totally
by surprise,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, referring to Mrs.
Dobson's allegations.
   There was ``a pattern that certainly raised questions in our
minds whether there might not be some kind of orchestrated effort''
by the South Africans, he said.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia for 74 years, but agreed to grant
the territory independence under U.N. supervison. Elections for a
national assembly are set for Nov. 7-11 and independence is
expected early next year.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, which waged a
23-year bush war against South African rule, is heavily favored in
the polls.
   Mrs. Dobson abruptly left her job in the Namibian capital of
Windhoek on Sept. 23 and flew to London with her South African
husband, Peter Dobson. The Namibian, which supports the South-West
Africa People's Organization, interviewed the couple there.
   Mrs. Dobson said she was part of a seven-member government
contingent with a $1.3 million budget.
   The group was to help promote the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy.
   She said the team was instructed to gather information on U.N.
officials for the purpose of embarrassing them. The group had an
entertainment allowance of $38,000 for this purpose, she told the
newspaper.
   Any embarrassing information was to be fed to ``selected
journalists'' working for newspapers opposed to the black
nationalist group, she said.
   Mrs. Dobson said she also was sent to interview Hans Dreyer,
commander of the notorious police counterinsurgency unit, Koevoet.
She said she was told to portray the unit as a ``group of ordinary,
decent people doing a great job.''
   Mrs. Dobson said her group included two members of the South
African Defense Force, a police inspector, and intelligence
officials.
   She said she and her husband have worked for the outlawed
African National Congress for 10 years. She said they fled because
they believed they had been uncovered.
   Dave Steward, head of the Bureau of Information, said Wednesday
that Mrs. Dobson ``was a junior official who did not have access to
sensitive material. The information she gained was available to
anyone.''

   Building supply stores, tool rental firms
and salvage companies braced Friday for their busiest weekend ever
as residents started to repair their earthquake-shattered homes.
   As damage estimates surpassed $4 billion, merchants throughout
the area rushed to fill orders for glass, plywood, cement,
flashlights, power generators _ and tarpaulins to shield from a
rainstorm sweeping in this weekend.
   ``It seems like the biggest problem now is going to be the
rain,'' said Rusty Santee, the owner of San Jose's Central Home
Supply. ``All those people who have a chimney down or a hole in
their roof need a tarp. What the earthquake missed, the rain should
get.''
   Of course, many homeowners could do nothing. Their homes were
either beyond repair or were condemned as unsafe.
   Multiquip Inc., a distributor of light construction equipment,
is toiling to ship electrical generators to the area.
   ``The industry is in extremely bad shape to take care of the San
Francisco disaster because of hurricane Hugo,'' Irv Levine, the
firm's president, said from the firm's Carson, Calif.,
headquarters. ``We were totally cleaned out of generators. We're
scrambling to get as many as we can.''
   More than 25,000 homes were still without power Friday morning.
Levine said his company's reserve stock of 1,000 generators is gone.
   ``We are renting lots of light towers, hydraulic house jacks,
skip loaders and scissor lifts,'' said Steve Probasco, a manager at
San Jose's A-1 Rents. ``For things we're out off, we're directing
our customers to our competitors.''
   Amid the growing demand for repair materials, merchants must
combat inoperative telephone lines, jammed or closed freeways and
sometimes severe damage to their own headquarters.
   The main San Francisco warehouse for auto-glass giant PPG
Industries was closed by the quake, with loss of inventory
estimated in excess of $50,000, said branch manager Howard Burrell.
   ``We're shipping from other locations,'' Burrell said as the
company tried to replace scores of broken windshields. ``We're
inoperative here.''
   While the shipping delays almost certainly will result in higher
prices for some materials, there have been no reports of price
gouging for items in shortest supply. ``I'm not trying to get into
a price war,'' said Probasco. ``We're just here to help people.''
   Dale Williams, owner of Central Allied Glass with a dozen stores
in the earthquake's vicinity, said that many homeowners are waiting
for aftershocks to subside before replacing broken windows.
   ``A lot of people don't want to put glass in right away,''
Williams said. ``They want to relax and wait until there's no more
shaking.
   ``But from our understanding, everybody's glass stock is in
great shape. They're not having problems with the distributors.''
Other glass companies are boarding up most broken windows and are
planning to complete glass replacements in coming weeks.
   ``If a store has lost its front, that's our first priority,''
said Howard Cobel, vice president of Oakland's Cobel Glass Inc.
``We're just boarding up now and we'll start installing glass this
weekend.''
   At Goodman Lumber Co. in San Francisco, the huge building-supply
store has organized a special display with earthquake-related items
like crescent wrenches, plaster, plumber's tape, fire extinguishers
and flashlights.
   ``We have sold out our stock of flashlights and batteries three
or four times over,'' said owner Charles Goodman. ``We are really
expecting to sell a lot of plywood. We're expecting quite a busy
weekend. We have never had a situation like this before.''
   At the same time, retailers are busy with a surge in demand for
consumer goods like bottled water, cleaning supplies like brooms,
mops, buckets and paper towels.
   ``Water right now is the No. 1 priority,'' said Deborah Lambert,
Safeway Stores' Northern California manager for public relations.
   Closer to the quake's epicenter, the idea of mops and
flashlights is far from the top priority.
   In Boulder, 14 miles north of Santa Cruz, more landslides were
expected in the mountains where 60 homes already have been
destroyed and at least 100 more directly threatened.
   ``The geologists will see if the cracks are in the bedrock or in
the ground,'' said Bud Tomlin, Boulder Creek's fire district chief.
``If it was just soil that was loose, that would be easier because
we could shore up the houses.
   ``If there are cracks in the bedrock, the whole mountain could
come down.''

   Pope John Paul II on Friday welcomed
Poland's first non-Communist prime minister in 40 years and told
him there must be no turning back from political change.
   Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity activist who came to
power Aug. 24, thanked the Polish-born pope for his support
``during the difficult years'' _ referring to the suppression of
Solidarity after the martial law crackdown in 1981.
   Mazowiecki, a Catholic intellectual and an old friend of the
pope, made Rome his first foreign visit since his appointment as
the East bloc's first non-Communist premier.
   The pope called the private 20-minute meeting ``historic.''
   In an emotional reunion, the men embraced outside the pope's
private library. John Paul told an aide there was no need for
introductions.
   Later, Mazowiecki said the meeting was the ``crowning, the fruit
of the dialogue, of which today we see the results.''
   John Paul turned toward a Polish TV crew and responded in
Polish, `We hope there's no turning back.''
   ``This is not possible,'' seconded Foreign Minister Krzysztof
Skubiszewski.
   John Paul's return to Poland in June 1979, eight months after
his election to the papacy, helped spark demands for democracy that
led to the formation of Solidarity, the first non-Communist labor
movement in the Soviet bloc.
   Mazowiecki told a news conference that ``Polish-Soviet relations
are at their most crucial moment.''
   He said there are many problems, but one of the biggest is
economic collaboration.
   ``We want to develop our economy through the East and the
West,'' he said, noting that he would discuss these problems when
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze comes to Warsaw next
week. During that visit a date for a Mazowiecki visit to Moscow
will be set.
   He also repeated his plea for immediate help from the West,
saying his country needs loans, investments and emergency food aid
within the next two months to help it through the harsh Polish
winter.
   The church, which has historically played a pivotal role in this
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, took part in the long
negotiations that led to elections this year and approval of a
24-member Cabinet that includes 12 Solidarity members and four
Communists.
   As evidence of the change sweeping the Soviet bloc, John Paul on
Friday ordained as bishops the Vatican's first ambassador to Poland
since the Communists broke diplomatic relations after World War II
and the first Roman Catholic bishop in Soviet Byelorussia in 60
years.
   ``Isn't this a sign of the changes taking place, which are
happening for the good of all believers,'' John Paul said in his
homily in the service in St. Peter's Basilica.
   Aides said Mazowiecki and the pope have met some 20 times during
John Paul's 11-year pontificate, most recently when Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa came to Rome in April.
   The Polish pope and prime minister also met privately at lunch
after the audience.

<HEAD>Hopes Dim for Repatriation of Cambodian Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The failure of recent peace efforts has
dimmed prospects for repatriation of the more than 300,000
Cambodians in refugee camps on the Thai side of the border, aid
workers said Friday.
   ``Repatriation is undoubtedly farther away from us than it
appeared even three months ago,'' said Urs Boegli, head of the
Thailand office of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   Many aid officials had felt increased diplomatic efforts put a
settlement within reach, but an international conference in Paris
in June did not resolve the civil war, which began with the
Vietnamese invasion of December 1978.
   About 300,000 of the Cambodians who fled the brutal Khmer Rouge
regime or the invasion that ended it remain in the U.N.-assisted
camps.
   Fighting nearby has intensified since Vietnamese soldiers left
Cambodia late in September, and Boegli said the camps are exposed
to increased danger.
   ``Do we have to fear a full-fledged attack on the camps?'' he
said. ``Of course this possibilty has to remain part of our
security planning.''
   He said the presence of guerrillas in the camps increased the
danger.
   The United Nations recently reduced food aid to the largest
camp, Site 2, on grounds the rebels were diverting supplies to
their own use. Khmer Rouge guerrillas control the camp, which
houses 140,000 refugees.
   Although repatriation may be delayed, aid agencies still must
prepare for it, said S.A.M.S. Kibria, U.N. special representative
for Cambodian refugees.
   ``The time has come to look beyond our established role of
providing basic emergency relief and consider greater emphasis on
social program to support and rebuild'' Cambodian society, he said.
   ``There are children as old as 10 or 12 ... who have never known
life outside a refugee camp,'' Kibria said, and the longer they
remain, ``the more serious becomes the risk that ... we will return
to Cambodia whole communities of socially handicapped persons
unable to earn a living or readjust to conditions in their own
country.''
   Kibria said more money was needed to finance reintegration
programs.
   He also expressed concern about reports that guerrillas may move
refugees back into Cambodia without involving international
organizations.
   ``Any movement of the population into Cambodia which lacks the
assurances of safety and freedom of choice cannot be supported,''
he said.
   Toshiyuki Niwa, director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation,
said the breakdown of peace talks could increase frustration among
the refugees in camps already plagued by murder, rape and other
crimes.

   Building supply stores, tool rental firms
and salvage companies braced Friday for their busiest weekend ever
as residents started to repair their earthquake-shattered homes.
   As damage estimates surpassed $4 billion, merchants throughout
the area rushed to fill orders for glass, plywood, cement,
flashlights, power generators _ and tarpaulins to shield from a
rainstorm sweeping in this weekend.
   ``It seems like the biggest problem now is going to be the
rain,'' said Rusty Santee, the owner of San Jose's Central Home
Supply. ``All those people who have a chimney down or a hole in
their roof need a tarp. What the earthquake missed, the rain should
get.''
   Of course, many homeowners could do nothing. Their homes were
either beyond repair or were condemned as unsafe.
   Multiquip Inc., a distributor of light construction equipment,
is toiling to ship electrical generators to the area.
   ``The industry is in extremely bad shape to take care of the San
Francisco disaster because of hurricane Hugo,'' Irv Levine, the
firm's president, said from the firm's Carson, Calif.,
headquarters. ``We were totally cleaned out of generators. We're
scrambling to get as many as we can.''
   More than 25,000 homes were still without power Friday morning.
Levine said his company's reserve stock of 1,000 generators is gone.
   ``We are renting lots of light towers, hydraulic house jacks,
skip loaders and scissor lifts,'' said Steve Probasco, a manager at
San Jose's A-1 Rents. ``For things we're out off, we're directing
our customers to our competitors.''
   Amid the growing demand for repair materials, merchants must
combat inoperative telephone lines, jammed or closed freeways and
sometimes severe damage to their own headquarters.
   The main San Francisco warehouse for auto-glass giant PPG
Industries was closed by the quake, with loss of inventory
estimated in excess of $50,000, said branch manager Howard Burrell.
   ``We're shipping from other locations,'' Burrell said as the
company tried to replace scores of broken windshields. ``We're
inoperative here.''
   While the shipping delays almost certainly will result in higher
prices for some materials, there have been no reports of price
gouging for items in shortest supply. ``I'm not trying to get into
a price war,'' said Probasco. ``We're just here to help people.''
   Dale Williams, owner of Central Allied Glass with a dozen stores

   ``A lot of people don't want to put glass in right away,''

   ``Water right now is the No. 1 priority,'' said Deborah Lambert,
Safeway Stores' Northern California manager for public relations.
   Closer to the quake's epicenter, the idea of mops and
flashlights is far from the top priority.
   In Boulder, 14 miles north of Santa Cruz, more landslides were
expected in the mountains where 60 homes already have been
destroyed and at least 100 more directly threatened.
   ``The geologists will see if the cracks are in the bedrock or in
the ground,'' said Bud Tomlin, Boulder Creek's fire district chief.
``If it was just soil that was loose, that would be easier because
we could shore up the houses.
   ``If there are cracks in the bedrock, the whole mountain could
come down.''

   Former President Carter's appeal to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev helped Emory University establish a
continuing teaching post for scholars from the Soviet Union.
   An agreement signed in September will establish a visiting
professorship in Soviet law, with a several Soviet legal scholars
occupying a chairman post, Emory President James T. Laney announced
Thursday.
   Emory Professor Harold J. Berman, who negotiated the agreement,
said Soviet professors have occasionally visited and taught at
American universities in the past, but this is the first time a
Soviet academic institution has agreed to staff a position in a
U.S. university on a continuing basis.
   ``It could not have been brought to fruition without the help of
... Carter, who wrote a letter to Soviet President Gorbachev urging
him personally to endorse the proposal,'' Berman said.
   Laney said he signed the agreement with B.N. Topornin, director
of the Institute of State and Law of the USSR Academy of Sciences.
The first professor to visit will be Igor Ivanovich Lukashuk, a
scholar in public international law, who will teach at Emory during
the spring semester.

<HEAD>KGB Plans to Cut Soviet Border Zone, Remove Barbed Wire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The KGB plans to cut the restricted border zones
it guards to a 10th of their current size and take down the barbed
wire in many areas, top officials of the agency told a Soviet
legislative committee Friday.
   Border-crossing procedures will also be simplified, Tass said in
a report on a session of the new committee that oversees the KGB
and the Defense Ministry.
   Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, head of the KGB, told the panel there was
no reason to maintain such a large border zone, the news agency
said. It did not specify the total area of the zone that the
200,000 border guards protect now, or how it will be reduced in the
future.
   The border plan was typical of recent KGB efforts to show that
it is moving away from a Cold War mentality and trying to keep pace
with the Kremlin's push for greater openness and democracy.
   Kryuchkov has given several interviews to the Soviet media, and
he defended the KGB before the legislature at his confirmation last
summer, saying it stayed strictly within the law at home.
   About 3,400 people were nabbed for illegally crossing into the
border zone since the beginning of last year, KGB deputy chief
Vadim Matrosov told the Defense and Security Committee.
   He said the southern Soviet border, particularly where it
touches on Afghanistan, requires extra frontier guards to combat
smuggling and armed gangs, Tass said.
   But in general, Matrosov said, the Soviet Union's improving
relations with most of its neighbors, including China, Iran and
NATO members Turkey and Norway, has led to reduced tension on its
border.
   In some places along the Chinese frontier, the forbidden zone is
hundreds of miles thick. Even along the border with its Warsaw Pact
allies, the Soviet Union has strung barbed wire and set armed KGB
guards in towers. Foreigners are barred from a 16-mile strip along
the Soviet border with Norway, Finland, Iran, Turkey and
Afghanistan.
   The country plans to ``remove the barbed-wire entanglement in
many areas,'' Tass said.
   The Soviet Union's border with China alone is 3,000 miles, the
longest land border between two countries.
   The Defense and Security Committee was created as part of
political reforms aimed at giving more real power to the Supreme
Soviet legislature, which was formerly a rubber-stamp for Communist
Party decisions.

   The Bush administration is working with
officials from three South American cocaine-producing countries to
determine a site for a drug summit, a White House official said
Friday.
   ``We can't rule anything in or out,'' said deputy press
secretary Alixe Glen.
   She commented in response to questions about a story in the
Washington Times, which said the Secret Service had informally
rejected Cartagena, Colombia, as the site for the summit because
the president's safety could not be guaranteed in a country torn by
drug-related violence.
   The newspaper said Puerto Rico was the most likely site, and
indeed, officials have mentioned that it is a leading contender.
   Ms. Glen said the United States was working with Peru, Colombia
and Bolivia to determine the location, timing, agenda and
participants for the summit. She said representatives of the four
countries will meet Nov. 20 to decide the details.
   Meanwhile, Secret Service spokesman Robert Snow declined to
comment on the report. ``We don't talk about our recommendations or
our procedures,'' he said.

sent scores of Cubans to the Talladega facility on the heels of
massive riots in prisons at Atlanta and Oakdale, La.

   The voice of Alcee L. Hastings boomed out of
the drizzle in the chill air outside the Senate entrance to the
Capitol.
   Hastings had just been convicted on the first of many articles
of impeachment, an act that formally removed him from office as a
federal district judge for the southern district of Florida.
   The former judge had a surprise in store.
   In the Senate chamber, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the
Senate's president pro tempore, gravely asked the question yet
another time:
   ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, Alcee L. Hastings,
guilty or not guilty?''
   And the voices came: ``Guilty,'' ``guilty,'' ``not guilty,''
``guilty,'' over and over.
   Hastings had left the voices behind after the second vote to
convict him, striding from the chamber to receive bearhugs from
supporters. In a morning consumed by votes by senators soberly
rising from their gleaming mahogany desks, he would be convicted on
eight counts, acquitted on three.
   Outside on the steps, Alcee Hastings, who had been the first
black federal judge in Florida history, looked out over the
thrusting cameras and microphones, his commanding voice penetrating
through the crowd.
   His conviction was unjust, he said. The fact that a jury had in
1983 acquitted him on similar charges marked his impeachment before
the Senate with the brand of double jeopardy and dealt a ``severe
blow to the cornerstone of justice _ the jury system.'',
   Hastings then took a wholly unexpected tack.
   Defiant, smiling, appearing supremely self-confident, Hastings
said that as far as he is concerned his career was far from over.
   ``Now that the Senate has forced a career change on me, I must
go forward,'' he said.
   He will go forward, he said, to become a Democratic candidate
for governor of Florida, to become a far from ordinary candidate.
   Hastings said he had called his mother immediately after the
first of the votes, first to tell her the result, then to say,
``we're off and running.''
   ``I think I have an excellent chance,'' he said. ``...I don't
have anything to lose by offering an interest in the issues facing
the voters of Florida. I think I can take the campaign to a level
that everybody will be proud of.
   ``Quite frankly, I think that not only can I be elected, I think
I will be ... I'm going to enjoy being governor.''
   A reporter asked: ``Why do you think you can be elected after
what just happened?''
   Hastings responded: ``Because I think that Floridians are tired
of ordinariness. And if there's anything else I bring to it, it's
this experience, it's not ordinary.
   ``Oh, I will hear signals,'' Hastings said. ``I will hear, `Oh,
it's shameful that he should do these kinds of things.'
   ``Let me tell you, my mama had a man; she did not have anybody
that was afraid of the system. I think change needs to take place
and I'm going to be involved in that change until I die.''
   He said there are no legal barriers to his candidacy.
   ``Banishment is a fiction,'' he insisted, and, pointing upwards
in the direction of the Senate chamber, added: ``And what we just
saw was extremely fictional ... There are those of you who will say
I should be banished in infamy, I know nothing that I have done
that requires that.''
   But Hastings also made clear that there may be something
quixotic in his candidacy.
   ``I will go forward with my life and I'll let the voters of
Florida tell me that I'm a terrible person _ and I will go forward
with my life,'' he said.
   Was he at all downcast by the fact of his conviction?
   ``I feel just fine,'' Hastings said, crisply emphasizing each
word. ``Perhaps better than I did quite some time ago.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., on Friday became
the 15th person in the last decade to be indicted on criminal
charges while a member of Congress.
   Garcia was convicted along with his wife, Jane Lee, in U.S.
District Court in New York of extorting payoffs from the Wedtech
Corp. in exchange for exercising political influence for the
military contractor. They were acquitted of bribery and receiving
illegal gratuities.
   Earlier this year:
   _Former Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga., was found guilty in June of
lying to a federal grand jury about a money-laundering scheme.
   Convicted on nine perjury charges involving his attempt to
negotaite an $850,000 home loan form an undercover agent posing as
a money launderer, Swindall, 38, was sentenced in August to a year
in prison and fined $30,000.
   _Rep. Donald E. Lukens, 58, R-Ohio, was convicted in May 26 of
contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor, a
misdemeanor. A Franklin County, Ohio, jury found him guilty of
having sex with the girl last November.
   Lukens was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $1,000. He is
still a member of Congress and has said he plans to seek
re-election.
   Garcia is not the first congressman to be convicted in the
scandal surrounding Wedtech, a minority-owned New York City machine
shop that had won no-bid U.S. Army contracts.
   Then-Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., was convicted in August 1988 of
racketeering, mail fraud and accepting bribes from Wedtech in
exchange for his influence.
   Biaggi, 71, resigned a day after his conviction and was later
sentenced to eight years in prison and a $242,000 fine.
   Biaggi also was convicted in November 1987 of accepting an
illegal gratuity _ a paid vacation _ for helping an ailing New York
shipyard. He was sentenced to 2{ years in prison and fined $500,000
in that case.
   Other members of Congress indicted since 1979:
   _Rep. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn., charged in April 1987 with bank,
mail and tax fraud. No trial date has been set. He is still in
Congress.
   _Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, R-Calif., indicted Jan. 23, 1986, along
with an aide on charges she tried to buy off an opponent for the
GOP Senate nomination in California. The charges subsequently were
dismissed by a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles; Fiedler lost
the primary.
   _Then-Rep. George Hansen, R-Idaho, indicted in April 1983 and
convicted one year later on charges of violating the Ethics in
Government Act by failing to report $333,978 in loans and other
transactions on his financial disclosure forms. Hansen was freed in
October 1987 after serving nearly one year of a five-to-15-month
sentence.
   _Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., convicted in May 1981 on
charges stemming from the FBI's Abscam investigation, including
conspiracy, bribery, conflict of interest, receiving an unlawful
gratuity and interstate travel in aid of a racketeering enterprise.
   Williams resigned from the Senate in March 1982. He was paroled
from a halfway house in January 1986 after serving nearly two years
of a three-year sentence. Six House members also were indicted as a
result of the undercover Abscam investigation, and all served
prison terms. They were:
   Rep. Raymond Lederer, D-Pa.; Rep. Michael Myers, D-Pa.; Rep.
John Jenrette, D-S.C.; Rep. John Murphy, D-N.Y.; Rep. Frank
Thompson, D-N.J.; and Rep. Richard Kelly, R-Fla.
   None of the seven indicted in Abscam are still serving in
Congress.
   _Then-Rep. Claude Leach, D-La., was indicted in July 1979 on
charges of buying votes in the 1978 election and violating federal
campaign finance laws. He was acquitted of some vote-buying counts
and the others were dropped, and a federal appeals court dismissed
the charges of campaign finance law violations.

   Opposition parties trying to unseat
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in elections next month said Friday
they would fight corruption, ease poverty and restore ``national
dignity.''
   A 40-page platform waved at a news conference by Vishwanath
Pratap Singh, Gandhi's chief rival and a senior leader of the
National Front coalition, offers few radical departures from
India's current stated policies.
   In many respects, it recalls pledges Gandhi made five years ago
when his Congress Party was re-elected in a landslide after the
assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   Elections scheduled for Nov. 22, 24 and 26 will choose a new
lower house of Parliament, which holds the political power in India.
   The opposition platform reserved its sharpest barbs for
corruption, the rallying cry of Singh's campaign to lead the 880
million people of the world's most populous democracy.
   Singh, a 58-year-old former Congress Party member and Gandhi
ally, echoed his platform's call for full investigation of the
Bofors arms scandal. The Swedish manufacturer is accused of paying
up to $50 million in kickbacks to clinch a $1.4 billion contract
with the Gandhi government.
   ``The funds will be restored to the nation and the guilty
punished,'' he declared at the news conference, and pledged to
restore India's ``national dignity.''
   When the Bofors contract was signed in 1986, Singh was Gandhi's
defense minister. He later resigned because of what he called
official reluctance to investigate newspaper allegations that
powerful Indians took payoffs.
   Gandhi repeatedly has denied profiting from the deal personally
or that Indians received payoffs or commissions, but the
allegations have dogged him for 2{ years.
   The opposition alliance seeks a broad base ranging from
communists to right-wing Hindu religious groups. Singh, president
of the People's Party and a secular centrist, has the task of
maintaining unity in such a coalition.
   No reliable poll has been taken in two months, but the consensus
of analysts and observers is that Gandhi and the Congress Party
face a tough challenge if the opposition hangs together.
   In its manifesto, the National Front also says it will
streamline a labyrinthine bureaucracy that predates independence
from Britain in 1947.
   It pledges to establish a national security council under the
prime minister to ``help evolve a consensus on our foreign and
defense policies,'' which the opposition claims are ``pursued in an
irrational and arbitrary manner by the present government.''
   India's armed forces number 1.4 million, fourth largest in the
world after the superpowers and China. It has tested nuclear
devices, has an expanding deep-water navy and is one of only seven
nations with demonstrated ability to develop and fire
intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
   Singh's opposition promised to ``be convincingly
peace-oriented'' and take ``a total view of defense rather than a
fractured service-by-service approach, which is the case at
present.''
   Foreign policy essentials are the same as Gandhi's. The
opposition platform cited the importance of remaining non-aligned
and strenghtening friendly relations with both the Soviet Union and
United States.

<HEAD>Sources Report Encouraging Response From Syria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saudi foreign minister returned to
this resort town Friday after talks in Syria aimed at resolving the
Lebanese crisis, and sources said he received encouraging responses
that may break the deadlock.
   Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal began a series of
meetings with Lebanese parliamentarians who for three weeks have
been discussing their country's future.
   The parliamentary talks have been stalemated by Lebanese
Christian leaders' demands that Syria withdraw its troops from
Lebanon before Lebanese Moslems are given a greater share of
political power.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
mandate to end the civil war. Lebanon's Christian leader, Gen.
Michel Aoun, said the Syrians abrogated the mandate by siding with
the Moslems in the war, and he has vowed to drive them out.
   Sources at the Taif conference, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saud was carrying ``positive'' replies from Syria
that may break the deadlock in the search for a plan to end the
14-year-old war.
   Before leaving the Syrian capital, the foreign minister said:
``Everybody is keen to ensure the success of the Taif meeting.''
   He said cooperation with Syria on the mission was strong, but he
would not go into details.
   A mediating committee of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria has
visualized a maximum two-year phased withdrawal of the Syrians from
Beirut and its environs.
   According to a draft charter, the Syrian troops would be
redeployed in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley for an indefinite
period until a strong central government was established in Beirut
and a security pact signed with Damascus.
   Aoun rejected the indefinite stay and insisted the Syrian
withdrawal start as soon a draft charter for national
reconciliation is ratified by a formal parliamentary session in
Beirut.
   Among the ideas circulated in Taif, according to conference
sources, is that a token Syrian pullout be completed before the
parliamentary session to approve political reforms and elect a
president.
   A ``security zone'' would be set up around the parliament
building in Beirut and probably would be policed by Algerian
troops, the sources said, to ensure that all arrived safely for the
session.
   Aoun said in newspaper interviews published Friday that the
parliamentary deputies should come home.
   ``I believe that this tough experience (in Taif) has convinced
them once and for all that negotiations should not be conducted
under occupation and no reforms can be achieved under occupation,''
he said.

<HEAD>Former Sperry Official Admits Role in Bribery Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive
admitted in court Friday that he initiated a bribery scheme in
which a Navy official was paid $400,000 to help the company compete
for a lucrative electronics contract.
   Frank J. Lavelle, 68, who was marketing director at the
company's Clearwater, Fla., facility, faces a possible 20-year
prison sentence for participating in the scheme that included other
officials of Sperry, which became part of Unisys Corp. following a
1986 merger with Burroughs Corp.
   Lavelle entered his guilty plea in U.S. District Court on a day
that Dennis Mitchell, a former Unisys marketing executive, was
sentenced to a 90-day term in a halfway house for arranging $4,000
worth of illegal corporate campaign donations to several
congressmen.
   The guilty plea was the latest in a series of more than 20
convictions of defense consultants, corporate executives and
Pentagon employees stemming from the Justice Department's
investigation of defense procurement fraud, nicknamed ``Operation
Ill Wind.''
   Lavelle admitted that he introduced Garland L. Tomlin Jr., a
former Navy procurement official, to Sperry vice-president Charles
F. Gardner, saying that Tomlin wanted a ``nest egg'' for his
eventual retirement from the government.
   Tomlin, 59, already has pleaded guilty to receiving $400,000
from Sperry in 1983 and 1984 and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc., in
exchange for bid information on a multimillion-dollar maintenance
contract on the electronic components of Navy weapons.
   Sperry was eliminated from competition for the contract even
though Tomlin wrote reports favoring the company's proposal and
promoted the bid with other Navy officials.
   Gardner, 59, who was vice president in charge of Sperry's
surveillance and fire control systems unit in Great Neck, N.Y., was
sentenced Sept. 15 to 32 months in federal prison for his role in a
separate bribery scheme.
   According to court papers, Gardner obtained permission from an
unidentified Sperry official before approving the payments to
Tomlin, which were funneled by defense consultant James G. Neal to
an offshore bank account Tomlin kept in the Bahamas.
   Neal, 65, who has been described by prosecutors as ``the banker
for Mr. Gardner and Mr. Gardner's operation'' has received a
27-month prison term for his role in the bribery scheme.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled Lavelle's sentencing
for Jan. 12, 1990.
   The judge, meanwhile, ordered Mitchell to perform 100 hours of
community service after serving a 90-day term in a halfway house.
   Mitchell admitted arranging, at Gardner's behest, the payment of
$4,000 in illegal corporate campaign contributions to various House
members who had influence over defense issues. They included Rep.
Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the House
Appropriations Committee.
   There was no evidence that the lawmakers knew they were
receiving illegal contributions, which were made in the names of
defense consultants hired by Unisys.
   Mitchell, who could have received a 10-year prison term, told
Hilton: ``I am sorry for my deeds and I am ready to face up to it
here.''
   While acknowledging Mitchell's cooperation with the Justice
Department's continuing investigation, prosecutor Lee J. Radek said
his crime was a ``very serious offense ... that goes to the heart
of the electoral process.''

   The Soviet government is offering to send doctors,
geologists and rescue workers to Northern California to help with
earthquake relief, Tass reported Friday.
   The Health Ministry is willing to send trauma specialists and
surgeons to the earthquake area and the Geology Ministry is
offering experts with their own equipment to help with seismic
predictions, the official news agency said.
   Tass added that a group of volunteer rescuers who gained
experience in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated
northern Armenia in December are also prepared to fly to California.
   Millions of dollars in aid and thousands of foreign rescuers and
doctors poured into Armenia after the Dec. 7 earthquake, which left
25,000 dead.

<HEAD>Shamir Urges US to Encourage Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration appeared Friday to be
at a critical point in its drive to open Mideast peace talks as
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir appealed for U.S. help in
drawing Palestinian Arabs into negotiations.
   A senior U.S. official said Secretary of State James A. Baker
III might soon decide to turn his attention to other foreign policy
issues. But diplomatic sources questioned the notion that Baker was
reaching a dead-end.
   ``You have a dialogue at the very highest level. It is very
substantial. They are discussing substantial ideas that might lead
to a breakthrough,'' said the sources, who spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
   Shamir, in a letter to Baker delivered on Wednesday, urged the
administration to help overcome ``intimidation'' keeping
Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza from participating in the
prime minister's proposal for elections, the sources said.
   Shamir also asked Baker to try to enlist moderate Arab
governments, such as Morocco and Jordan, to join with Egypt in
trying to implement the elections proposal, the sources said.
   Baker followed up the letter in a telephone coversation with
Shamir Thursday evening and with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens on Friday morning. But the details were not disclosed as
Baker took off for a long weekend at his ranch in Wyoming.
   Before he left, a senior U.S. official said Baker was ``not
going to pursue this from here to eternity.'' Also, the official
told reporters after demanding anonymity, Baker was giving the
problem ``100 percent but there could be a limit to how long you
continue.''
   Among the main roadblocks are rejection of the election proposal
by the Palestine Liberation Organization's Central Council and
Shamir's insistence that PLO members not participate in talks with
Israel.
   The State Department, after accusing SHamir of hindering the
process with unhelpful and disappointing remarks, offered
assurances Thursday it was not trying to pressure Israel into
talking to the PLO, which in its covenant is committed to
dismantling the Jewish state.
   Shamir, meanwhile, thanked Baker in the letter for his efforts
to implement the election proposal, which is designed to produce
limited self-rule for Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza and
negotiations five years later on an overall settlement.
   The letter was not made public, but the diplomatic sources
dislosed Shamir elaborated in it on his refusal to negotiate with
the PLO and on his election proposal and urged Baker to saek
support for Egypt from modertate Arab countries.
   Also, the sources said, Shamir asked the Bush administration to
discuss the election plan with Palestinian leaders on the West Bank
and in Gaza who are more likely than the PLO to respond favorably.
   After all, Shamir reasoned, the Palestinians in the territories
are the ones who would vote, negotiate and ultimately live under
the arrangement worked out with Israel.
   The prime minister stressed the point local Palestinians need
bolstering so they will not be afraid to stand up to
``intimidation,'' the sources said, adding: ``This is very
high-profile, intimate diplomacy. They may come to an agreement.''

<HEAD>Laws Passed to Rehabilitate Victims of Political Trials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament voted Friday to rehabilitate
victims of political trials in the Stalinist era and to disband the
armed guard created to protect the Communist Party after a 1956
revolt.
   The decision to dissolve the Worker's Militia, the Communist
Party's private army, came less than two weeks after the party
renamed itself the Socialist Party and committed itself to
pluralism and democratic ideals.
   The Socialist Party, whose leadership is largely comprised of
the same people who led the Communist Party, had backed a proposal
to disarm the 60,000-member force but keep it as a civil defense
organization.
   The Socialist Party remains in power at least until
parliamentary elections due early next year. They are to be the
first freely contested national elections since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948.
   ``The existence of the Worker's Militia ... is no longer
justified,'' declared Justice Ministry state secretary Gyula Borics
in introducing the legislation.
   On the last day of the session, the house adopted two bills
exonerating victims of political trials and other reprisals. One
bill rehabilitated all those convicted of revolutionary activity
after 1956 and pledged unspecified compensation to victims of
reprisals.
   Earlier this year the government had already rehabilitated Imre
Nagy, the leader of the 1956 uprising, and several of his close
associates.
   A second bill also formally rehabilitated those victimized
between 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially considered
Hungary's Stalinist period.
   The house also overwhelmingly approved a proposal to declare
Oct. 23, the day the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising began, as a day of
``national reconciliation.'' However, the house rejected a motion
favored by the opposition that it be made a national holiday.
   Tens of thousands are expected to rally in front of Parliament
Monday to mark the 33rd anniversary of the start of the 1956
revolt. It will be the first time such a public rally is permitted.
   In a statement issued Friday, the Socialist Party presidium said
it ``rejects'' the Soviet invasion that crushed the revolt and
opposed all forms of intervention or interference in a country's
sovereignty.
   Reforms enacted in the past year have put Hungary at the
forefront of democratic change in Eastern Europe along with Poland,
the only country in the Soviet bloc with a non-Communist-led
government.
   This week's session of parliament was dedicated to enacting
legislation designed to create the legal framework for next year's
multiparty elections.
   Earlier in the day the body adopted an electoral law envisaging
a modified system of proportional representation.
   It also adopted a bill outlining procedures for electing a
national president, but postponed a decision on when he would be
chosen. The Socialist Party and most of the major opposition groups
had tentatively agreed on Nov. 26 as the date for a direct
election, with subsequent presidents appointed by Parliament.
   But some opposition groups, fearing the short campaign period
would give the Socialist Party candidate an unfair advantage, have
collected nearly 200,000 signatures calling for a referendum on the
issue. A minimum of 100,000 signatures is required to force a
plebiscite. This issue is to be discussed when Parliament resumes
Oct. 30.
   On Thursday, the house passed legislation permitting opposition
parties to field candidates in the elections.
   The legislature also voted overhwelmingly to ban parties from
the workplace, defeating an alternative proposal backed by the
Socialist Party to allow party activity there. Politicization of
the workplace has been a key element of Communist indoctrination.

   President Bush toured the
earthquake-ravaged San Francisco Bay area today, saying ``I'm
deeply moved'' as he got a first-hand look at a collapsed freeway
that trapped rush-hour motorists. The president said he would ``do
what's needed to be done'' to speed federal aid.
   Administration officials worked on a program of assistance as
the president made his brief trip. Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner offered no pricetag but said the federal government would
take on ``a very, very major role in helping California.''
   After stops in Oakland and San Francisco, Bush flew to this
coastal community only a few miles from the epicenter of Tuesday
night's killer earthquake.
   ``We've got to get these disaster centers open and take the
claims,'' he said as he walked down the main street looking at
shattered buildings.
   Bush cited the work of public and private relief agencies and
said, ``God bless those volunteers.''
   ``In terms of what it will cost, I don't know,'' he said. ``But
the federal government will work with these other entities, the
government entities, the private entities, to see the suffering is
alleviated, the restoration begins.''
   He added, ``I'm willing to do what's needed to be done.''
   ``Jesus,'' muttered the president as he walked next to the
two-deck freeway in Oakland, the ground covered with rubble,
including massive chunks of concrete and giant fallen pillars.
Twisted steel girders protruded from the collapsed structure.
   Smashed cars were visible at some points between the upper and
lower decks.
   ``I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very
stimulated by this team effort,'' the president said.
   He complimented rescue teams and said, ``I'm very proud'' of the
military participation.
   He also said he admired ``the way this community is pulling
together ... we'll see what we can do to be part of the answer.''
   Bush, tieless and wearing a flight jacket with the presidential
seal on the right breast, toured the area on foot and chatted with
rescue workers.
   The president took a two-block motorcade to the site of the
Interstate 880 collapse. He was greeted by several California
congressmen, including Democrats Ronald Dellums, Tom Lantos,
Fortney Stark and George Miller.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, who had attended a briefing by
local officials with Bush on his arrival at Moffett Field, also
accompanied him to the rescue site, staying on the periphery as
Bush chatted with the authorities.
   Agnos had complained earlier that he was snubbed by Vice
President Dan Quayle when Quayle toured the area Wednesday.
   From Oakland, Bush went to the Presidio, a U.S. Army base in San
Francisco, where he met with city officials. The base, on the shore
of San Francisco Bay, is adjacent to the heavily damaged Marina
district.
   Bush announced he was appointing Skinner to coordinate federal
relief efforts.
   The president confessed he had had some second thoughts about
visiting the quake area, not wanting to get in the way. But, he
said he concluded, ``if you don't go _ why it's neglect.''
   Bush also taped a television public service announcement here
seeking to reassure the quake-weary Bay area that help was on the
way.
   Agnos, one of three mayors accompanying the president on his
tour, told Bush: ``We need fast action. We need checks written on
the spot.''
   ``We've got to work with each other,'' Bush told the local
officials.
   Skinner would not say how much money was in the package but
claimed ``it will be substantial.''
   ``These first 90 days virtually all of ... emergency expenses
would be covered, I assume, by the federal government,'' Skinner
said.
   He said cleanup and repair were ``primarily a California
effort'' but the federal government would help in any way it could.
   From Oakland he flew across the bay to San Francisco to tour the
heavily damaged Marina area.
   Bush was greeted at Moffett Field by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
Gov. George Deukmejian and Rep. Norman Mineta, a Democrat who
represents the southern San Francisco Bay area.
   Democrats have pledged at least $2.5 billion in federal funds to
assist quake victims. But Skinner said, ``I don't think the $2.5
billion will have a degree of preciseness attached to it.''
   He said, ``I don't think anybody can tell you at this moment
exactly how much is going to be needed.''
   Bush's trip, on the heels of the tour by Quayle and Skinner, is
part of swift administration action in the wake of complaints that
the federal government responded too slowly after Hurricane Hugo
struck the Caribbean and southeastern United States. Bush went to
South Carolina following the hurricane to assess damage there.
   ``I will be going out there tomorrow to take a look and to
provide encouragement to people,'' Bush said Thursday as
congressional leaders vowed to increase disaster aid for victims of
the quake that has wreaked more than $2 billion in damage.
   House Speaker Tom Foley on Thursday estimated at least $2.5
billion in federal funds would be needed to pay for the quake
assistance. He said the House would vote to provide it in a stopgap
money bill that comes up Tuesday.
   He vowed to come up with the funds but said he did not know
where the money would come from.
   Agnos, a Democrat, had complained that Quayle did not visit him
during his tour of the region on Wednesday. Agnos accused Quayle of
a ``publicity stunt.''
   Fitzwater said Agnos was invited to Quayle's two meetings with
local officials and was offered helicopter transportation to attend
them, but rejected the offers.
   The White House said an initial $273 million will be available
for the area from a pool of $1.1 billion that Congress appropriated
after the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo.

   More than 10,000 pro-democracy supporters staged a
rally in an East German city, opposition leaders said Friday, in
the latest sign that activists will keep up the pressure on the
country's new leader.
   Members of the outlawed pro-democracy group New Forum said the
rally was held in three churches in the city of Zittau Thursday
night and thousands also gathered on the city's market square.
   Loudspeakers were set up so the crowd outside could hear a
debate on reform going on in one of the churches, said Andreas
Schoenfelder, a New Forum member in Zittau.
   Communist East Germany made its first open appeal to the tens of
thousands of citizens who have fled West in recent months to return
home.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Wolfang Meyer said East Berlin's
diplomatic missions would help East Germans return as quickly as
possible.
   ``We want to help anyone, unless there are reasons to prevent
it, to come back home,'' Meyer said.
   More than 55,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany since
July.
   State-run media Friday continued to report critically on
economic and political problems.
   The Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland devoted four pages
to the debate on how to solve the nation's problems ``by improving
socialism.''
   ``Our (Communist) Party is proving that it has the courage to
face the truth,'' the newspaper said in a commentary. ``The party
has renounced window-dressing and its presumptuousness.''
   A West German official, meanwhile, rejected conditions set by
East Germany's new leader, Egon Krenz, for the possible loosening
of travel for East Germans to the West.
   Krenz said Thursday a new law would be drafted to expand travel
rights, but he made it clear that substantial economic and
political hurdles stood in the way of letting everyone travel West.
   Many East Germans say lack of travel freedoms is one of the
worst hardships of the tightly controlled society. It has been one
of the main causes of the exodus of tens of thousands of East
Germans this year to the West.
   Krenz said the government is drafting a new law that could
ultimately ease travel abroad, including to the West, and allow all
East Germans to possess a passport. But he said the biggest
obstacle to freer travel to the West is Bonn's Germany's refusal to
recognize East German citizenship.
   East German leaders say economic problems also pose considerable
obstacles, because East Germans need West German currency for the
visits.
   East Germans cannot now go to a bank and exchange East German
marks for West German ones.
   Dorothee Wilms, who heads West Germany's Ministry for
Inter-German Relations, said Friday that Bonn will not change its
position on the East German citizenship issue, and said East Berlin
already receives millions in hard currency from West Germany.
   Wilms, in an interview with West Germany's ZDF television, said
East Germany gets the hard currency through compulsory currency
exchange from West German tourists and that Bonn pays more than
$270 million a year in connection with transit route agreements
alone.
   ``If East German officials really want to allow their citizens
free travel to the West, then they should use some of this money,''
Wilms said.
   Earlier Friday, Wolfgang Lueder, a member of West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition, said Bonn should not
allow East Berlin's apparent readiness to expand travel to the West
``to fail because of money.''
   Lueder was quoted in Cologne's Express newspaper as saying Bonn
should allow East Germans to change money at a one-to-one ratio.
East German currency is not convertible to Western currency.
   ``East German tourists would be really helped if they could
change between 300 and 500 East German marks for the same sum in
West German marks ($162 to $270),'' Lueder was quoted as saying.
   The West German mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported Krenz
and other top Communist leaders met to discuss the refugee problem
that has seriously strained the nation's economy.
   Bild said the discussion centered on whether to simply let all
those who are disenchanted with the system to leave the country in
order to ``maintain total Communist Party control.''
   The newspaper quoted on official as saying: ``That could be 10
million.'' It said another official responded: ``So what, Sweden is
a prosperous land and only has 6 million.''
   East Germany has a population of about 16.6 million.
   In Austria, officials said Friday about 900 East Germans had
crossed from Hungary to Austria en route to West Germany in the
last 24 hours.
   Border guards said the crossings brought to 40,600 the number of
East Germans who have crossed into Austria since Hungary opened its
border for the East Germans Sept. 11.
   Also Friday, East Germany's state-run ADN news agency reported
the Soviet monthy magazine Sputnik will be allowed back into the
country after being banned for nearly a year.
   The magazine was banned after it published several articles
critical of Soviet leader Josef Stalin and questioning the actions
of German Communists before the outbreak of World War II.
   Krenz took over Wednesday from Erich Honecker, who ruled East
Germany for 18 years.

<HEAD>US Accuses Nicaragua of Subversive Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department accused Nicaragua on
Friday of systematically violating Central American peace
agreements by continuing clandestine efforts to send military
equipment to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler made the accusation
after Honduran security forces found large amounts of weapons which
she claimed originated in Nicaragua and were earmarked for the
Salvadoran insurgents, known by the Spanish initials FMLN.
   The seizure occurred at a border crossing between Nicaragua and
Honduras and, according to Ms. Tutwiler, included AK-47s, rifle
grenades, explosives, thousands of rounds of ammunition and FMLN
instruction manuals.
   Honduran officials are currently evaluating the facts involved
in their seizure, she said.
   ``There is no doubt, however, that Nicaragua regularly,
systematically and continually aids, arms and trains the FMLN
guerrillas. Nicaragua thereby remains the principal violator of the
Central American peace agreement,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Tutwiler said the command and control of the FMLN continues to
operate from Nicaragua in violation of two agreements signed by
five Central American presidents, including Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega.
   She added that Nicaragua, in ``direct contradiction'' of its
claims, has continued to send large quantities of weapons to the
FMLN in the 20 months that have passed since American aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras was suspended.
   Honduran military officials have said that the weapons found
Wednesday morning were hidden behind false walls in a truck that
was carrying furniture from Nicaragua to an undetermined location
in El Salvador.
   The seizure was said to have been the largest ever involving a
Nicaraguan shipment but no dollar figures were available.

   An Irishman who was exonerated in an IRA bombing
after spending 14 years in jail was freed on bail Friday pending
his appeal of a separate murder conviction.
   Paul Hill was the last of the ``Guildford Four'' defendants to
be released.
   The four were serving life sentences for two IRA bombings that
killed five people in 1974 in Guildford, southwest of London. A
London judge overturned the convictions Thursday, ruling that
police probably lied to get them.
   The government immediately ordered an inquiry into police
actions.
   Hill, 35, was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a
British soldier. He was freed on $6,500 bail and emerged from the
court to cheers from friends and relatives, including his
14-year-old daughter, Cara.
   ``I am very happy,'' he told a reporter. ``How do you think I
feel after 14 years of hell?'' He was flown to Belfast to begin his
appeal of the murder conviction.
   In the ruling Thursday, Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice, said
police officers involved in the investigations that led to the
bombing convictions ``must have lied.''
   The convictions were upheld in 1977 even though Irish Republican
Army members made detailed confessions in the case.
   David Williams, deputy chief constable of the Surrey county
police force, whose officers handled the original investigation of
the Guildford Four, said three officers had been suspended pending
an inquiry.
   He identified them as a sergeant and two constables. He said a
fourth officer involved, a detective inspector, had died and a
fifth, a detective chief inspector, had retired.
   In addition to Hill, the appeals court threw out the convictions
of Gerard Conlon, 35, and Patrick Armstrong, 39, of Belfast, and
Carole Richardson, 32, of London, in the bombing of two pubs at
Guildford on Oct. 5, 1974.
   It also overturned convictions of Armstrong and Hill in a pub
bombing in the London suburb of Woolwich on Nov. 6, 1974. Two
people died in that attack.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said Thursday he was
satisfied ``the system has the capacity to correct its own
mistakes'' in the Guildford case, but he said he also believes six
Irishmen convicted in IRA bombings in Birmingham, England were
wrongly convicted.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible for
police, rejected calls to reopen the case of the so-called
Birmingham Six, who were convicted of bombing Nov. 21, 1974. The
attacks killed 21 people.
   Hurd told the BBC the case of the Birmingham Six had been
examined in the same way as the case of the Guildford Four, and
with no new evidence emerging, the convictions were sound.
   In court Thursday, prosecutor Roy Amlot disclosed evidence that
five officers in the Guildford case altered documents, withheld
evidence and ``seriously misled the court.''
   At their 1975 trial, the Guildford Four retracted their
so-called confessions, which they said police had beaten out of
them.
   Hurd said the inquiry into police misconduct also will examine
the conviction of the so-called Maguire Seven on explosives
charges. The defendants include the late father of Conlon, one of
the Guildford Four.
   A cartoon Friday in The Independent showed Hurd staggering from
a bomb-wrecked building labeled: ``Criminal Justice System.''
   The liberal London newspaper The Guardian called the incident
``A story filled with shame.''

<HEAD>Officials: New Sanctions Would Penalize Americans Who Do Business
with Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans who do business with Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega or any of the more than 30 firms in which he
has an interest could face jail terms and $500,000 fines under new
sanctions being imposed by the Bush administration, U.S. officials
said Friday.
   Many of the firms are used as intermediaries for trade between
the United States and Cuba, which has been illegal since 1960, the
officials said.
   The move is designed as a deterrent to Cuban efforts to
circumvent the trade embargo, while damaging Noriega's business
interests, according to the officials, who asked not to be
identified.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler had no comment on
the measure, which was first reported in Friday's editions of the
Los Angeles Times. A formal announcement is expected next week.
   The administration has been groping for ways to force Noriega
from power but has been reluctant to utilize extreme measures, such
as a trade embargo, out of concern that hundreds of American firms
in Panama would go bankrupt. In addition, the harm inflicted on the
Panamanian economy would take years to overcome.
   The new sanction is narrowly targeted at Noriega and his
business partners and is not expected to do major damage to the
economy as a whole.
   It is not clear how extensive the business dealings are that
Americans have with the firms linked to Noriega. Cuba has found
these firms useful, importing through them high technology
U.S.-made items which otherwise would be beyond Cuba's reach
because of the trade embargo.
   The firms also have served as conduits for illegal Cuban exports
to the United States, the officials said.
   The administration had begun examining ways to bring new
pressure to bear on Noriega well before the abortive coup attempt
on Oct. 3.
   One move being considered is barring Panamanian-flag vessels
from U.S. ports. Another is the withholding by U.S. agencies of
certain taxes they pay to the Panamanian government on behalf of
their Panamanian employees.
   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez ended a two-day visit to
Washington on Friday with praise for the restraint President Bush
showed in not committing Panama-based U.S. forces to the assistance
of the rebel officers who tried to overthrow Noriega earlier this
month.
   ``Interventionism is never desirable,'' Gonzalez said through a
translator. ``I'm very pleased to know that it has not happened.''
   Gonzalez has offered some ideas for resolving Panama's crisis
but he acknowledged that a solution cannot be achieved by third
countries.
   ``It should be a Panamanian solution; otherwise there will be no
solution,'' he said.
   Gonzalez has called for new elections in Panama and for the
newly elected leadership to have the authority to name a new
Defense Force commander to replace Noriega.
   Noriega would be allowed to remain in Panama and thus would
remain out of the reach of U.S. law enforcement authorities.
Noriega is under indictment in Florida on drug trafficking charges.
   Gonzalez believes that a solution to Panama's crisis would be
eased if less attention is devoted to Noriega's personal fate and
more toward achieving the democratic rule blocked by Noriega's
theft of an election earlier this year.

   Typewriters clattered in newsrooms again
this week as newspapers around Northern California scrambled to
publish after the earthquake darkened computer screens and silenced
presses.
   When the quake struck, newspapers from Monterey to San Francisco
were forced to improvise to publish special editions, at times
resorting to writing by longhand in the flickering light of candles.
   ``The sound of the old manual typewriter was heard in the
newsroom for the first time in a million years,'' said Reg Henry,
editor of The Herald of Monterey.
   The Herald, without power, was able to publish an earthquake
special edition that hit Monterey streets Wednesday night by
arranging to print at a weekly paper's plant in King City, 50 miles
to the south.
   A team was sent to King City to produce the 12-page special
edition. Reporters wrote by hand and typewriter with candles
burning at their sides.
   ``I was very proud of what we did,'' said Henry. ``It was a
very, very trying experience.''
   Mike Wallace, editor of the Watsonville Register-Pajaronian,
said Friday that in the first hours following the quake he couldn't
reach his reporters because phone lines were out in the area, which
was close to the epicenter.
   At daybreak, reporters spread across their territory then
returned to the powerless office to write on battery-powered laptop
computers in sunlight from the front window.
   Wallace made arrangements to print at the Register's sister
paper, the Telegram-Tribune, 160 miles south in San Luis Obispo.
The laptop stories were sent over phone lines to laptops at the
Telegram-Tribune, then transferred to that paper's main computer
and edited.
   A private plane flew the newspapers to Watsonville, where they
reached the streets just after 6 p.m. Wednesday.
   The ``long, arduous process'' was worth it, Wallace said,
because readers were hungry for news. More than 15,000 copies of
the eight-page edition, without ads, were quickly snapped up.
   The Register-Pajaronian was nearly back to normal and produced a
24-page edition Friday, he said.
   ``We had a hairy day on Wednesday, but rule No. 1 in this
business is you always publish,'' said Wallace.
   In San Francisco, the Chronicle used generators to put out
Wednesday morning's eight-page edition, produced on Apple Macintosh
computers. The afternoon Examiner also used generators, flashlights
and Macintoshes to get out the news.
   Both published full editions Friday with most of their regular
sections.
   Tossing aside traditional rivalry, the San Jose Mercury News
helped the Santa Cruz Sentinel publish a 12-page special edition by
8 p.m. Wednesday.
   The Sentinel, a morning paper, sent editors and darkroom and
composing workers 25 miles to San Jose for the editions published
Wednesday through Friday evenings.
   The Sentinel hoped to resume morning editions by Sunday.
   Editor Bruce McPherson praised the Mercury News for its
cooperation.
   ``We're impressed. They were really great. They were really
helpful,'' said McPherson. ``They were a class operation.''
   Some newspapers were lucky, such as The (Oakland) Tribune.
   Leroy Aarons, senior vice president for news, said the Tribune
survived the quake with its electricity intact. The computers were
quickly revived.
   The morning Tribune was able to put out a complete edition on
schedule, said Aarons. The paper printed 206,000 papers, some
60,000 more than normal.
   The Mercury News also came out on time, printing 100,000 extra
copies the morning after the quake.

   Alcee L. Hastings, removed on Friday from his
federal judgeship, can run for governor of Florida if he chooses.
But he can't run for the United States Senate or the House of
Representatives.
   The Constitution says so.
   Hastings announced immediately after his conviction by the
Senate on eight articles of impeachment that he would run for
governor of his state.
   The Constitution specifies that conviction by the Senate
includes ``disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor,
trust or profit under the United States.'' That refers to federal,
not state office.
   The impeachment clause of the Constitution gives the House of
Representatives ``the sole power of impeachment'' _ to bring
charges against a president, vice president and ``all civil
officers of the United States.'' The power to try the individuals
on these charges is given to the Senate.
   It is the only means by which federal judges, who hold their
office for life, can be removed from the bench.
   The word impeach means to accuse. The House votes to impeach,
when it adopts articles of impeachment. The Senate then conducts a
trial on these issues and if the accused is convicted, he is said
to have been impeached.
   Hastings was convicted of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a
$150,000 payoff.
   He is the sixth official removed from office after trial. Only
one president, Andrew Johnson, has ever been tried by the Senate,
and he escaped conviction by one vote.
   In Richard Nixon's case, the House Judiciary Committee voted
three articles of impeachment against Nixon, but the president
resigned before the matter could be brought before the full House.
Nixon stepped down after he was told by Senate leaders that his
conviction in any trial was certain.

   Lawyers can use evidence about bus safety
to fight the 27 murder charges their client faces from last year's
bus-crash disaster, a judge ruled Friday.
   But the prosecution can use results of blood alcohol tests to
prove Larry Mahoney was drunk when he rammed his pickup into the
bus carrying a church youth group, Carroll Circuit Judge Charles
Satterwhite said.
   Satterwhite also ruled that photographs of the victims can be
used by the prosecution to illustrate a large bus seating chart,
but that the jury cannot be shown pictures of the victims' burned
bodies.
   Mahoney, 36, is charged in the deaths of three adults and 24
children and teen-agers who were killed in the May 14, 1988, crash,
one of the nation's worst bus disasters. His trial is to begin Nov.
8
   Police said Mahoney was driving in the wrong direction on
Interstate 71 southwest of Carrollton when his truck collided with
the bus, which burst into flames. One adult and 39 youths escaped,
some with severe injuries.
   Mahoney's attorneys had made clear their intention to base his
defense on the condition of the bus _ a school bus bought as
surplus by Radcliff First Assembly of God church.
   Special Prosecutor Paul Richwalsky opposed that, but the judge
sided with the defense team. He also rejected the defense's attempt
to bar the use of multiple blood-alcohol tests conducted on Mahoney
within hours of the crash.
   Mahoney's lawyers had argued that blood samples were illegally
obtained and that test results were unreliable.
   Observers of the case have said Mahoney's sole hope at trial may
be in trying to show that safety defects, not his wayward driving,
were ultimately responsible for the deaths.
   The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the
probable cause of the accident was Mahoney's ``alcohol-impaired
condition.'' But it added that contributing to the accident's
severity was the puncturing of the bus' fuel tank and the resulting
fire, as well as its flammable seat cushions and bench seats that
partly blocked the rear emergency door.
   The Kentucky medical examiner found that all 27 deaths were due
to smoke inhalation and that no one on board was seriously injured
by the crash impact.

   Who needs the National Weather Service
with Rosemary Kilduff around to keep an eye on woolly worms.
   The Beattyville woman Friday predicted in an annual survey that
winter in central Appalachia will have an early kick and a late
bite, because the fuzzy caterpillars were mostly black on the ends
and brown in the middle.
   This is the eighth year Mrs. Kilduff has conducted her woolly
worm survey, also taking into account other Appalachian folk signs
to make her winter predictions.
   About 250 people called Mrs. Kilduff during the four-week survey
to report 1,423 woolly worms were black on the ends and brown in
the middle; 52 were solid black; 82 were light colored; and 11 were
white, she said.
   In addition, there were 25 local foggy mornings in August, three
hornets' nests seen very low to the ground and three persimmon
seeds with spoon-like structures in the middle.
   ``So we would predict from the woolly worms that our winters
would be cold on each end and mild in the middle and that it will
snow but that the snow won't lay on because the hornets' nests are
close to the ground,'' Mrs. Kilduff said.
   The height of the hornets' nests indicate the height of snow _
the higher the nests the deeper the snow, Mrs. Kilduff said. The
shape of the persimmon seeds generally indicate snow, and the color
of the woolly worms predicts the severity of winter, she said.
August fog tells her how many snowy days winter will have.
   Mrs. Kilduff said her forecasts are ``remarkably accurate.''
Last year, she predicted a milder than usual winter that proved to
be true, said National Weather Service forecaster Gil Russell.
   Radio stations in New York City, Minneapolis and Chicago called
Mrs. Kilduff this week to discuss her predictions. National
Geographic magazine sent a photographer and writer to cover this
weekend's Woolly Worm festival that will include a woolly worm race.

   About 300,000 farmers will be getting nearly
$1.5 billion in federal payments for highly erodible cropland in
the long-term Conservation Reserve Program, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the annual cash rental payments are
for contracts farmers signed in 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989.
   Under the program, producers agree to retire eligible cropland
from production for 10 years. In return, USDA helps farmers pay for
establishing grass and trees on the land to protect it from
erosion, and pays annual rental payments. Those average around $50
per acre annually.
   Bjerke said the payments will be made ``soon as possible.''

   California officials have turned down offers
of earthquake help from 20 countries because they believe they have
enough resources at hand, the State Department said Friday.
   These countries had offered aid as of Friday morning, the
department said: Australia, Austria, Britain, Bulgaria, Canada, El
Salvador, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal,
Singapore, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Venezuela
and West Germany.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said consulates
in the San Francisco area had reported no injuries to their staffs,
and most reported minor damage to their offices and homes.
   However, she said, the homes of three diplomats were destroyed _
one Italian, one Soviet and one West German.

   There was an empty seat in President Bush's
motorcade when it pulled out of the White House gates long before
dawn Friday. The president's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, was
missing.
   No one seemingly noticed Fitzwater's absence as Bush rode
through an early-morning rain to Andrews Air Force Base to catch
Air Force One to fly to Northern California to inspect earthquake
damage.
   Yet, puzzled flight attendants on Bush's plane noted that
Fitzwater, who virtually always accompanies the president, was
listed on the manifest for the flight and they inquired about his
whereabouts.
   When he didn't show up, his seat was given to a magazine
reporter who was stranded at Andrews after missing an earlier
flight to California on a plane chartered by the press corps
accompanying the president.
   White House press aides who had flown ahead on the earlier press
charter were baffled when their boss didn't get off Air Force One
with the president at Moffett Naval Air Station near San Jose,
Calif.
   The mystery was solved back in Washington.
   Fitzwater had missed the motorcade's departure at 5:31 a.m. He
said he had been working in his office and no one alerted him that
the motorcade was about to pull out.
   When he went out in the rain to join the motorcade, Fitzwater
was told it had left a minute or so earlier. He spent the rest of
the day working at the White House.

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Friday convicted U.S. District Judge
Alcee L. Hastings of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a $150,000
payoff, making him the sixth federal official in the naton's
history removed from office by impeachment.
   ``I have no choice but to accept their judgment,'' said
Hastings, pausing in a drizzle on the Senate steps as he left the
chamber. He maintained his innocence, called the trial unfair,
pledged to run for governor of Florida and said he would resume the
practice of law.
   Hastings, 53, Florida's first black federal district judge, was
acquitted of the bribery-conspiracy charges in a criminal trial six
years ago.
   The Senate sealed his fate when it voted 69-26 to convict him on
the first of 17 articles of impeachment, charging him with
conspiracy to obtain a bribe.
   In two hours of back-to-back roll calls, the Senate found him
guilty on eight of the articles, acquitted him on three and waived
action on six.
   Senate President Pro Tempore Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., announced the
results and declared that ``it is therefore ordered that the said
Alcee L. Hastings be and is hereby removed'' from the office for
which he was paid $89,500.
   His ouster followed by three years a similar action against
Judge Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada, the fifth official ever removed
in an impeachment case. The Senate is nearing final action on
impeachment charges against Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi.
   Hastings left the Senate a free man, facing no prison sentence
and with no criminal acquitted on his record.
   The impeachment trial was not designed to reverse the verdict of
the jury that acquitted him in 1983 but to remove him from the
bench.
   For that reason, his accusers scoffed at Hastings' frequent
complaint that he was a victim of ``double jeopardy'' because he
had already been acquitted n court of the same charges.
   ``Do you then not take the matter up and then let a judge serve
who you know is guilty of bribery?'' Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas,
told a news conference following the Senate's action. The articles
of impeachment had been prepared by the House.
   ``This isn't a case of double jeopardy,'' said Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla. He said that was so because ``we are sitting in a separate
forum with separate standards of proof.''
   But he voted to acquit Hastings on all articles of impeachment.
   ``The evidence presented was not clear and convincing,'' Graham
said.
   Hastings watched at a table on the Senate floor throughout the
first roll call while defense attorney Terence J. Anderson kept a
tally. Anderson showed the results to Hastings before they were
announced and they shook hands.
   A moment later, defense attorney Patricia Williams, a longtime
Hastings friend, left the chamber. She was soon followed by
Hastings and Anderson.
   ``I'm upbeat and can go forward with my life ...,'' he told
reporters. ``There are those of you who would say I should be
banished in infamy. I know nothing in my life that requires that.''
   Hastings was accused of plotting with William Borders, once a
prominent Washington attorney, to obtain a bribe from two brothers,
Frank and Tom Romano, who each were facing three-year fraud
sentences imposed by Hastings.
   Borders was arrested Oct. 9, 1981, while driving from a suburban
Virginia motel with an FBI undercover agent posing as Frank Romano
and a garment bag containing $125,000 in cash.
   Hastings, in Washington for a testimonial dinner in honor of
Borders that night, was told that the FBI wanted to question him
but instead quickly returned to Miami by an indirect route without
checking out of his hotel.
   Borders later served a prison sentence in the matter and was to
be released Friday from jail, where he had been held for contempt
of court for refusing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial.
   Hastings was acquitted Friday of one count of perjury, which he
had been chraged with in telling the jury he had not expected
Borders to appear in a Washington hotel room Sept. 12, 1981. His
accusers said the hotel room meeting was part of the conspircay.
   In an anticlimax, the Senate acquitted him, 95-0, of a charge
that in an unrelated case he improperly disclosed information
obtained from a court-authorized wiretap under his supervision. The
Senate also acquitted him of an omnibus or ``catchall'' charge that
he had acted improperly or given ``the appearance of impropriety.''
   Hastings said that what ``the Senate has said is a standard of
almost proven, innuendo and inference is good enough to remove a
judge or executive officer by way of impeachment. That is chilling
and fraught with potential to do a lot of harm.''
   He said he was ``hopeful that some book offers will come along.''
   ``There are so many wonderful and tragic stories that are born
of this saga. They need to be told and tell them I shall.''

<HEAD>Hardhit in 1906, Old Buildings Of Chinatown Appear To Have Survived</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC PREWITT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinatown, among the hardest-hit
neighborhoods in San Francisco's gigantic 1906 earthquake, appeared
to be one of the luckier ones this time.
   ``I was absolutely surprised that Chinatown didn't have serious
damage Tuesday,'' city Supervisor Tom Hsieh said Friday. ``But the
damage could be hidden from the surface.''
   The teeming neighborhood of narrow streets crowded with
restaurants, food markets and souvenir shops covers about a
mile-square area near North Beach and the Financial District. It is
home to about 40,000 people.
   Hsieh said that he plans to introduce legislation at the board
of supervisors meeting Monday which would require thorough
inspection of unreinforced masonry buildings in the city. He
estimates there are at least 1,000 such buildings, mostly in
Chinatown and the Tenderloin, housing about 10,000 people.
   ``They were built with bricks in the old days with no
reinforcement bars inside. The bricks were put together with sand
and some kind of plaster mixture which has no structure capacity.
   ``The buildings somehow survived. But between the bricks, the
mortar might be totally deteriorated, and if there are additional
shakes, we may see major collapses of these unreinforced
buildings.''
   Hsieh, of Chinese ancestry, is the city's first supervisor of
Asian background. He also is a former architect.
   Some of the older buildings in Chinatown predate the 1906 quake.
The district is one of the most densely populated in San Francisco.
   ``It was badly damaged in 1906 but not flattened altogether,''
Hsieh said.
   On Tuesday, some bricks were shaken off buildings and onto the
streets and some windows were broken. Most of the damage was inside
shops and restaurants, whose employees loaded trashcans with the
remains of glassware, china vases and other items.
   Jimmy Wong, who served George Bush crispy chicken and butterfly
prawns during last fall's presidential campaign, was still out of
business Friday because of an empty refrigerator at his Empress of
China restaurant.
   ``We had to throw (food) out and reorder,'' Wong said.
   The Empress of China opened for dinner at 5 o'clock on Tuesday
and the first two customers had just been seated when the
earthquake hit. Wong and his employees spent the next day cleaning
up broken liquor bottles, dishes and glasses.
   ``All the bottles at the bar fell and a lot in our storeroom
were broken. But the food (lost) was more expensive than than the
liquor,'' Wong said. ``I don't have any damage estimate yet.''
   Orlando Kuan, proprietor of a coffee shop and bakery down the
street, stayed open with the help of candlelight for several hours
and sold out his supply of pastry.
   ``People were buying everything. They didn't know if they'd be
able to get anything to eat the next day. I heard that some places
charged higher prices after the earthquake. We didn't do that,''
Kuan said. ``I didn't do that.
   ``I was just happy that we were all right, and I wanted to help
people.''
   Kuan did not lose gas service, so was able to continue cooking
pastry Wednesday and Thursday. Most of Chinatown did not get
electic power restored until Thursday afternoon.

<HEAD>Couple Pleads Guilty to Time-Share Resorts Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who lured consumers to visit
time-share resorts with false promises of expensive prizes pleaded
guilty Friday to charges of defrauding creditors of more than $1
million.
   David A. DeFusco, 34, and his 28-year-old wife, Annette,
admitted to a bankruptcy fraud conspiracy in guilty pleas that U.S.
Attorney Henry Hudson said ``ends the story of a very charmed life
led by those two individuals.''
   Hudson said the couple used phantom corporations and aliases to
hide money frozen in bankruptcy proceedings from creditors who
claim unpaid debts of $2.5 million from the DeFusco's and their
companies.
   The couple had ``every kind of luxury item you could imagine,''
including eight mink coats, a Rolls Royce and two Mercedes-Benz
automobiles, Hudson said.
   After the trustee ordered liquidation of their assets last
spring, the DeFuscos sold two cars and moved $250,000 worth of
personal possessions to Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., and opened another
business under assumed names, Hudson said.
   FBI agents who raided their California home on July 5 found
jewelry, furs, a Persian rug worth $15,000, and art work valued at
more than $10,000, Hudson said.
   The search also uncovered a well-worn copy of a book entitled
``How to Create a New Identity'' that Hudson said was ``the Bible''
of the DeFusco's business operations. ``They became masters of
deceit.''
   DeFusco, who pleaded guilty Oct. 6 in Beaumont, Texas, to fraud
charges stemming from the operation of the couple's direct-mail
advertising company, admitted diverting $1 million worth of
corporate and personal assets that had been frozen by a U.S.
bankruptcy trustee.
   Mrs. DeFusco, who was sobbing as she appeared before U.S.
District Judge Claude Hilton, admitted diverting $290,000 worth of
assets as part of the scheme with her husband.
   Each could be sentenced to 25 years in prison and fined up to
$750,000 for guilty pleas to conspiracy to conceal assets from a
bankruptcy trustee and money laundering. DeFusco also faces a
possible 10-year term for his fraud convictions in Texas.
   Hudson told reporters the DeFusco's had lived in a $1 million
house in Great Falls, Va., with a gardner, maid and a nanny. They
often dined twice a week a an expensive French restaurant where the
bill was $250.
   Their creditors claim $2.5 million in unpaid bills, including
$60,000 for American Express credit-card charges to buy jewelry,
Hudson said.
   The couple mailed millions of pieces of advertising that
promised prizes ranging from televisions to imported cars to people
if they drove hundreds of miles to visit time-share condominium
resorts, prosecutors have said.
   In earlier guilty plea, DeFusco admitted conspiring with Freedom
Financial Corp. to lure residents from Midwest and Southwest states
to visit time-share resorts in Texas and Missouri.
   The Federal Trade Commission has filed suit to seek an
injunction barring the DeFuscos from continuing the mailings.
   Defense attorney Kent A. Schaffer disagreed with Hudson's
description of his cleints. ``This isn't a situation where two
people set to out see how much theycould steal,'' he said.
   ``They are people who have been successful in business for a
time,'' he said. ``In 1986, they started to have problems of money
owed to the postal authorities.''
   ``They got on a treadmill'' trying to pay off the $240,000 owed
to the Postal Service for mailing costs, Schaffer said.
   He accused Hudson and Robert J. Wortham, the U.S. attorney in
Beaumont, Texas, of competing ``to see who is going to get the
first press conference'' about the case.
   As part of the plea agreement, federal prosecutors in Seattle
agreed not to press fraud charges stemming from the DeFusco's
operation of another marketing company.
   The couple also agreed to help investigators trace assets that
are still missing.

<TEXT>
   Art thieves who knew what they wanted picked
their way through the home of a collector who lost in excess of
$500,000 in china, a crystal chandelier and 19 impressionist
paintings by his late father.
   The FBI, called in after the theft last month, termed the
initial half-million dollar loss figure extremely conservative.
   Among the items lost in the heist was the masterpiece ``Meet at
White Horse,'' an impressionist view of horses and hounds gathering
for the hunt, by Charles Morris Young, who left his best works to
his children.
   The art was stolen from the home of Young's son, Brinton Coxe
Young, in the nearby community of Wayne sometime between Sept. 7
and Sept. 14.
   The thieves also packed up 20 paintings by other artists, a rare
Waterford crystal chandelier worth as much as $100,000, family
jewelry and silver, china, antique furniture and Oriental rugs,
police said. Among the family treasures reported missing was a gold
sealing ring that once belonged to Arthur Middleton, one of the
signers of the Declaration of Independence and an ancestor of
Brinton Young on his mother's side.
   The thieves were well-informed, police said. They knew what they
wanted and were aware that the family was not expected home for
some time.
   For example, the burglars searched through a large china cabinet
but took only a set of original blue-and-white Canton plates,
leaving behind some Canton copies, according to Tredyffrin Township
police detective Charles Myers.
   ``This isn't like stealing a car or a stereo,'' Myers said this
week. ``It's a narrow market and art thieves are a narrow and
esoteric group. They are not your normal smash-and-grabbers.''
   The elder Young was a student and award-winning artist at the
Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, which owns four of his
paintings. He also studied at Colarossi Academy in Paris and
enjoyed some international acclaim. His paintings won medals and
were exhibited in shows and gallleries across the United States and
also in Europe and South America.
   If Charles Morris Young's reputation is not widespread, it is
only because so many of his paintings have been lost, said Charles
T. Clark, director of development for the Florence Griswold Museum
in Old Lyme, Conn., which owns some of Young's work.
   A fire in 1962 at the elder Young's home in Radnor, a posh
Philadelphia suburb known for its fox hunt, destroyed 185 of his
paintings. He was able to repaint a few of his best pieces before
he died two years later at the age of 95.
   Clark, an authority on Young's paintings, said that the artist
``was a very skeptical person'' who did not like to give his work
to anyone but those closest to him.
   ``There's no reason in the world he could not have had a
national audience were he more widely exhibited,'' Clark said.
   FBI agent John H. Kundts said the original $500,000 estimate of
the loss was ``an extremely conservative figure.'' An FBI spokesman
said Friday that there were no new developments in the case.
   ``The money doesn't matter,'' said Hilda Osterhout, wife of
Brinton Young and close friend and biographer of her late
father-in-law. ``It's the fact that the beauty is gone.''
   She is contacting art galleries, publications and organizations
to alert members of the art community that the paintings have been
stolen.
   ``We're going to get them back,'' Osterhout said. ``We've got to
get them back.''
   Most of the stolen paintings were 20 inches by 24 inches, or 30
inches by 40 inches, as is ``Meet at White Horse.'' The smallest,
called ``Rose Tree Hunt,'' is six inches by eight inches.

   The Agriculture Department said Friday that
Lamia's Sausage Co. of St. Louis, Mo., is voluntarily recalling all
of its meat products because they may contain high levels of
sulfites.
   The company sells some products across the counter in its St.
Louis retail store, but most products are distributed to
restaurants in nearby areas in Missouri and Illinois.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said no illnesses have been reported
but that consumers and other purchasers should ``immediately return
any products produced by the company.''
   The recalled products include: Lamia's Spedini's, bratwurst,
Italian sausage with cheese, Italian sausage with beef and tomato
sauce, Italian sausage (pork), ground beef patties, ground beef,
and Italia Brand Beef Patty Mix. Products can be identified further
by the establishment code ``Est. 13000'' inside the USDA inspection
seal.
   Crawford said that because of the high levels of sulfites found
during testing, sulfite-sensitive consumers could become seriously
ill or even die.
   ``Sulfites are not permitted as direct additives in meat or
poultry because the chemical can mask spoilage,'' he said.
   But sulfites may enter processed meat and poultry products if
vegetables used as ingredients have been treated with the chemical
at safe levels, Crawford said. To alert consumers, the word
``sulfites'' must be included in the ingredients statement on the
package.
   However, he said, the levels of sulfites detected in Lamia's
meat samples greatly exceeded levels considered to be safe.

   Cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 8.06 million head as of Oct. 1, down 6
percent from a year ago and 10 percent less than two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Iowa held even with a year ago, but other states showed declines
from feedlot inventories of Oct. 1, 1988.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during July, August and
September totaled 5.86 million head, down 5 percent from the same
period of 1988 and 3 percent below 1987, the report said.
   Further, the placement of new cattle and calves on feed during
the third quarter of the year totaled 5.69 million head, down 5
percent from last year and 14 percent from two years ago.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.37 million head
in October, November and December, down 2 percent from last year's
fourth quarter and 4 percent below 1987, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Oct.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   Masked men with knives killed two Palestinians
on Friday who were accused of collaborating with Israel, and
wheeled one body through the streets of Nablus as a warning to
others, Arabs reported.
   In Nablus, the occupied West Bank's largest town, masked
Palestinians stabbed 24-year-old Taher Abu Saleh to death, then
pushed the body through the central market on a cart and dumped it
on the street just before dawn, Arab journalists said.
   Other masked Palestinians entered the home of Harb Odeh Essa,
43, at the Bureij refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip and slit
his throat, according to Arab reporters.
   Israeli soldiers seriously wounded two Arab teen-agers in the
Gaza Strip. The army said one was shot when he tried to grab a
soldier's rifle.
   Saleh's death in Nablus was blamed on the Red Eagles, one of two
Palestinian gangs said to be active there against alleged
collaborators.
   At least 132 Palestinians have been killed by others, most as
alleged collaborators, since the uprising in the occupied
territories began 22 months ago. Israeli soldiers or civilians have
killed 596 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have died.
   Israel radio said Friday that Shimon Peres, vice premier and
finance minister, had postponed plans to visit the Soviet Union
because Kremlin officials would not guarantee a meeting with Soviet
leaders.
   Peres wanted to meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev or
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the radio reported,
quoting his spokesman, Meron Reuven.
   It said Peres, who leads the Labor Party, sent chief political
aide Nimrod Novick to Moscow last week to arrange the visit.

<TEXT>
   A visit from the archbishop of Canterbury is
the highlight of bicentennial festivities this weekend for the
Episcopal Church, the U.S. branch of the world's second-largest
Christian denomination.
   The itinerary for the Most Rev. Robert A.K. Runcie, spiritual
head of the world's 70 million Anglicans, included celebration of
the Eucharist at the Episcopal Church of the Saviour on Friday
night, followed by a banquet at Memorial Hall in the city's
Fairmount Park.
   Runcie will also speak at a Sunday service at Christ Church,
where George Washington and Benjamin Franklin attended services.
   Runcie was invited to Philadelphia by Christ Church, sponsor of
a conference held since Wednesday on the founding of the Domestic
and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church
in the United States of America in 1789.
   During two sessions that summer and fall in Philadelphia,
American church leaders adopted a prayer book and a constitution
that gave shape to doctrine, discipline and worship.
   According to the Diocese of Pennsylvania, Runcie's remarks at
Friday's banquet were expected to touch on the founding of the
Episcopal Church, the first free and independent Anglican church
outside the British Isles.
   Today the Anglican Communion includes 28 national or regional
churches in 164 countries.
   Runcie's visit follows by three weeks his first official visit
to the Vatican, where he and Pope John Paul II signed a document
committing the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches to heal their
450-year-old split.
   Vatican and Anglican officials have been holding talks since
1966 on unifying their churches. The estrangement began when King
Henry VIII formed his own church after the pope refused to grant
him an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
   Among major points separating the churches are the ordination of
women, which the Episcopal Church and some other Anglican churches
permit, and the doctrine of papal infallibility, which applies to
Roman Catholic beliefs such as the Immaculate Conception of the
Virgin Mary and her assumption to heaven after death.
   The Episcopal House of Bishops, during a recent meeting in
Philadelphia, affirmed the ordained ministry of women while calling
for sensitivity toward those who believe women should not be
ordained.
   The bishops' statement welcomed Suffragan Bishop Barbara C.
Harris of Massachusetts, the first female bishop in the Anglican
Communion, but said those within Anglicanism who oppose the
ordination of women ``hold a recognized theological position.''
   Runcie's visit coincides with the Diocese of Pennsylvania's
annual diocesan convention Friday through Sunday. The 73,000-member
diocese includes 169 parishes and missions in the five-county
Philadelphia area.

   Legislation enabling California to receive
extra emergency highway funds for repairing the collapsed Bay
Bridge and other federal highways was introduced Friday with one
senator saying he wanted to know why a section of Interstate 880
gave way in Tuesday's earthquake.
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, introduced the bill, which would
waive the $100 million cap on emergency highway funds for a single
disaster and allow the money to be used on the Bay Bridge, which
would normally be ineligible for such emergency relief because it
is a toll facility.
   The emergency highway-aid fund currently has $219 million,
consisting of this year's $100 million authorization and a $119
million carryover from previous years.
   Highway money also exists in a $10 billion highway trust fund
financed by user fees and fuel and tire taxes, but that money is
not available for emergency highway aid.
   Symms is the ranking member and former chairman of the
Environment and Public Works subcommittee on water resources,
transportation and infrastructure. The subcommittee is chaired by
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   Moynihan said he would like to hold hearings ``to ask the
necessary question, `Why was it that a 60-story skyscraper survived
this event event in California without any damage of any kind, and
two-story highways collapsed?''
   ``The interstate system is now in effect completed. ... but we
also observe that there are portions that fall down more readily
than they ought, that do not withstand the shocks that we can
obviously provide for,'' he said. ``If we do it in a 60-story
building, we can do it a two-story concrete highway. We want to
know about that.''
   Engineers and California officials have said the two-level
highway, which had been strengthened, should have been able to
withstand the quake.

   Patrolman Gary Fappiana's job these days
is tracking down reports of people missing and feared dead in the
rubble of the collapsed Cypress overpass on Interstate 880.
   In the first 2{ hours after the quake hit Tuesday at 5:04 p.m.,
he learned first-hand what it's like to fear that a loved-one may
have been killed in an earthquake.
   ``My wife does travel on that section of the freeway, and she
gets off at 5,'' Fappiana said Friday. ``She was two blocks away
when it came down. I was watching a station that didn't have verbal
communication with the helicopter showing the pictures, but I knew
that was the Cyrpess structure that had come down.
   ``I waited 2{ hours in front of the TV 'til she came home.''
   Ten police officers make telephone calls every four hours around
the clock to those who have made missing persons reports to find
out if people have turned up.
   By Friday afternoon, a total of 242 people had been reported
missing in Oakland at some point in connection with the earthquake,
said Sgt. Greg Hughes, who heads the missing persons office. Of
those, 145 were later located, including seven dead whose next of
kin have been notified.
   He said that left 97 missing, all of whom had a chance of
driving on Interstate 880 when a mile-long section of the
double-decker freeway collapsed, trapping cars in the rubble. Other
police reports have put the number missing as high as 167.
   Hughes said about 80 of those were reported from the beginning
and 15 or 20 represent more recent reports.
   One of the missing is Melissa Maxwell, a deputy district
attorney for Alameda County.
   She left her office, located next to the freeway, on Tuesday
afternoon for the San Francisco airport to pick up some relatives,
and hasn't been heard from since, said Senior Deputy District
Attorney John Adams.
   ``They found some cars and one of them looked like hers,'' Adams
said. ``We're hoping for the best, but who knows?''
   Marc Zambetti, 27, a sales manager for Stella D'Oro Biscuit Co.
in San Leandro, is also missing.
   ``He left work at 12 minutes to five on the earthquake day
heading for the city,'' plant manager Dominic Clarco told the
Tribune. ``Two hours later, I started hearing about the Cypress
overpass collapsing.
   ``Right now, I am on pins and needles waiting to hear,'' he
said. ``We've just hired somebody who is going to sit in his
apartment for the next 24 or 48 hours in case someone calls, in
case he calls.''
   Fappiana said that as many as a dozen wrecked cars towed away
from the freeway had no bodies in them.
   ``It's totally amazing,'' said Hughes. ``I can't understand it,
unless some people had some pre-warning and were able to abandon
their cars.
   ``We have not had anybody calling us back to say, `I made it out
of my car,'' Hughes said.
   He added that the count has been complicated by the fact that
some of the dead who have been identified were never reported
missing.
   That's why police are regularly calling everyone who has made a
report.
   ``It's not like an air crash, where people are international,''
said Hughes. ``You have people, working stiffs, living in the East
Bay or the ity (San Francisco).
   ``There's a lot of people close to home,'' he said.
   Danna Fabella, division director of children's placement
services for Alameda County, has been running a volunteer hotline
for people asking about loved ones.
   She was so busy after the earthquake, she never called her
husband, who was on a business trip in Puerto Rico, to let him know
she was safe.
   ``He called me at 3 in the morning and absolutely cried,'' she
said. ``I said I was sorry, but I knew I was OK. I just didn't
think he would be worried.''

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos joined
gray-haired alumni and fifth-graders in Pilgrim outfits Friday to
mark the 350th anniversary of the nation's oldest free school _
made new for its birthday by an infusion of renovation funds.
   Cavazos said the refurbishing of Mather School, where morale had
sagged as graffiti and other scars multiplied in the past decade,
``speaks to the way our nation is getting together to address our
education deficit.''
   The school was founded in 1639 as a one-room boys' school with a
grass roof. It flourished, moving five times to accommodate its
growing enrollment. But in 1974, federal orders to desegregate
Boston schools through busing contributed to a middle-class exodus
to the suburbs, and the school's condition deteriorated. It took a
new principal and the looming anniversary to get the $1.2 million
renovation under way.
   Friday, the new Mather was polished and humming, equipped with a
set of gleaming windows, a new playground out front to greet the
visitors and a refurbished auditorium.
   ``I think this shows that when we put the resources there, the
system can work,'' said Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, who said he hoped
to do the same for every school in the city.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who over the past year has struggled
with a state budget shortfall that has forced him to cut back state
school aid, reminded the audience that improvements in schools have
a price.
   ``Taxes, tuitions, those funds for this school didn't come out
of the air,'' the governor said. ``We've got to decide just how
important schools are. And the real work has just begun.''
   To many 600 alumni and others on hand, however, taxes and
renovation seemed beside the point as they greeted old friends and
students they had not seen in decades.
   ``I wouldn't miss this for the world,'' said Lola Tassinari
McGrail, who taught French at Mather from 1941 to 1953. ``Many of
my students are here now.''
   Nearby, a group of gray-haired men and women in tweed exclaimed
over a yellowed picture of the class of 1932, pointing out their
younger selves.
   The photographs, where white faces stare out in sepia tones,
portrayed another facet of the major changes at Mather. Fifteen
years after the school was ordered to integrate, 80 percent of the
student body is black and Hispanic.
   ``We are now truly a worldwide school,'' said Principal Michael
Marshall. ``This diversity makes us vibrant and strong, but it also
puts us on the front lines of what's happening in the community.''
   On stage, the students showed the audience how much Mather had
altered. Four classes of fifth- and sixth-graders sat on chairs
wearing placards with flags from such countries as Kenya, Turkey,
Ethiopia and Israel, to proclaim the lands their ancestors
inhabited 350 years ago.
   One of those attending was Rose Cosgrove, 81, who graduated from
Mather in 1921, and whose daughter, Eileen Keeney, teaches remedial
math there. Keeney said she came to the school because it had an
opening, but she considered her mother's attendance there a bonus.
   ``It's exciting that I'm in the same school (my mother) was,''
said Keeney, 44. ``A few weeks ago, I was in a room where all the
old records were, for attendance and such, and I looked up her
records. It made me really happy.''

<HEAD>State Department Praises Warsaw Pact Inspection Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Friday praised a
proposal by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on military inspections in
Europe and said it was close to NATO's approach.
   However, at least two major differences over reducing troops and
weapons surfaced.
   The Soviets and their six allies called for limits on military
budgets and a freeze on modernizing military airfields and bases,
U.S. officials said.
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, they said it was
practically impossible to make accurate comparisons between
military spending on the two sides. And, the officials said, NATO
needs to be able to improve its installations.
   A current example is altering a base in Italy in order to deploy
F-16 jet fighters being transferred from Spain.
   ``You don't want to find yourself down the road with your
physical plants run down,'' an official told The Associated Press.
   The Warsaw Pact's acceptance of the U.S. idea of permanent
inspections of military installations, including key transit
points, could also cause friction within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Two key members, Britain and France, are opposed to the concept
promoted by the United States and now the Soviet Union, which made
its presentation Thursday at negotiations in Vienna, Austria.
   The negotiations, involving 23 countries, are designed to reduce
troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons across
Europe. A priority issue is how to verify current levels of troops
and weapons and then reductions under a treaty President Bush has
predicted will be completed by May.
   The president has called for a ceiling of 275,000 on U.S. and
Soviet troops in the area. NATO proposed last summer that the two
alliances be limited to 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces and
3,800 aircraft.
   The Warsaw Pact has not offered a formal response, but Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has indicated on several occasions
he favored across-the-board reductions in the non-nuclear armaments
deployed on the two sides of the East-West divide.
   The pact called for permanent inspection of military facilities,
including transit points; short-notice, random checks that could
not be blocked; and restraints on military exercises.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, reacting to the
overall Warsaw Pact position, said, ``The East proposals on
verification appear to be based on the concepts that NATO
presented. We are pleased that the Warsaw Pact approach to
verification appears to parallel that of NATO.''

<TEXT>
   An international conference on
endangered species Friday rejected a U.S. proposal to limit export
of elephant tusks classified as hunting trophies.
   The 91-nation conference ended its meeting after adding 60 types
of orchids, the salmon-crested cockatoo and the Pacific Island
flying fox to the list of species threatened with extinction.
   But while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species considered proposals to mark as threatened more than 200
animals and plants during its meeting, its main concern was the
world's rapidly declining elephant population.
   On Monday, the convention put the elephant on the endangered
species list and with that approved a ban on trade in ivory.
   On Friday, it rejected the U.S. proposal to set quotas for the
tusks, a move that would have allowed a maximum 750 elephants to be
killed every year for sport as opposed to commercial trade purposes.
   Such a quota would have allowed big-game hunters to take the
prized tusks home. In the absence of international rules, federal
legislation in several countries, including the United States, will
outlaw hunting trophies under the conference's ban on ivory trade.
   A member of the U.S. delegation said the proposal was designed
to help wildlife management.
   The delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many
countries still will permit the import of hunting trophies and that
the proposal would have limited the number of elephants killed for
sport.
   Botswana delegate Mushanana Nchunga, calling for rejection of
the U.S. proposal, said: ``It's strange that the same people who
have pushed for an ivory ban are saying it's OK to hunt elephants
for sport ... OK to decorate the house with tusks but not for a
woman to wear ivory earrings.''
   The ban on ivory sales goes into effect Jan. 18. It covers trade
in elephant tusks, skins and meat and all existing stocks of ivory,
most of them in Hong Kong, where Asians in particular covet ivory.
   However, countries can get around the convention rulings by
filing for exemptions and several southern African countries _
including Botswana, Mozambique, Malawi and Burundi _ have indicated
they will do so because they consider their elephant management
programs a success.
   Zimbabwe already has formally requested one and South African
chief delegate Pieter Mulder said Pretoria was ``swaying toward''
asking for an exemption.
   Under convention rules, this would allow them to sell ivory to
member countries that also have exemptions and to more than 60
countries outside the convention.
   Japan, the world's biggest market for ivory, has not said
whether it will request an exemption.
   The conference decided Friday to hold its 1992 conference in
Tokyo.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entire military command met
with journalists Friday and declared that a demand by leftist
rebels for a purge of the armed forces was ``ridiculous and
impossible.''
   Rebel leaders contend the commanders are corrupt and implicated
in human rights abuses.
   The unusual gathering of the defense minister, air force
commander, chief of the joint chiefs of staff and commanders of all
brigades and battalions _ two generals and 35 colonels in all _
reaffirmed a rejection of the idea Thursday by President Alfredo
Cristiani.
   ``We feel it appropriate to provide a strong, clear, united
response to the proposal made by the FMLN in Costa Rica,'' said
Gen. Humberto Larios, the defense minister.
   He described the rebel demand that he and 16 other top
commanders be remoed as ``absurd, ridiculous and impossible.''
   Representatives of the rightist government and the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla alliance, ended
three days of peace talks Wednesday in Costa Rica. No substantive
accord was reached, but they agreed to another meeting next month.
   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed, most of them
civilians, since the civil war began 10 years ago.
   In a nationally broadcast address Thursday, Cristiani also
called the purge demand ``ridiculous.'' He accused the rebels of
using the talks ``tactically'' in an effort to isolate the
government and divide the armed forces.
   ``The FMLN has not demonstrated the political will to want to
achieve peace,'' said Cristiani. ``It refuses to talk about a
cessation of hostilities. Its entire attitude is one of
provocation.''
   He said it was ``totally absurd'' for the guerrillas to demand
that any cease-fire agreement recognize their control of territory
and stipulate that Supreme Court judges be replaced.
   ``We recognize the FMLN is a reality, that it exists, but it is
a small reality and cannot oblige the government to change the
republic's constitutional system,'' Cristiani said.
   Guerrilla forces control a swath of northern and eastern El
Salvador and are present to some degree in all 14 provinces.
   The rebels say the government's insistence on an immediate
cessation of hostilities without agreement on eventual reforms is a
disguised call for surrender.

   Rep. John Bryant celebrated the Senate's vote
Friday to oust U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings from the bench
by sipping champagne and eating pizza.
   ``The rewarding feeling I have is that a complicated and
controversial case ended with justice being done,'' said Bryant,
appointed by the House as the chief prosecutor in Hastings' Senate
trial. ``I feel 100 percent certain that he was guilty and clearly
should not be serving as a federal judge.''
   Bryant said he expects the former federal judge to campaign
against him as he seeks the Democratic nomination for Texas
attorney general.
   Hastings, the first black U.S. District Court judge in Florida,
said he would do so during a recent meeting in Houston with a
coalition of black Democratic leaders, where he also complained he
was being unfairly prosecuted by Bryant, the Dallas congressman
said in an interview.
   But Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said black
voters should not hold Bryant's role in the case against him.
   Hooks said that since all but three members of the congressional
Black Caucus voted to impeach Hastings, ``it's difficult to say
that because a white man took part, he should be singled out ...''
   Hooks said one of those congressmen supporting Hastings'
impeachment was Rep. John Conyers, a Detroit Democrat who ``no one
can say is soft on positions affecting black people.''
   Bryant, meanwhile, said he feels vindicated by the Senate's vote
to convict Hastings of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a $150,000
payoff, making the Miami judge the sixth federal official removed
as a result of impeachment.
   ``I was not certain what the verdict would be at any stage,
because of the fact that it was a case that involved a previous
acquital of the judge on one of the central charges,'' Bryant said.
``Of course it also involved a conviction of his co-conspirator for
conspiring with the judge to extort a bribe.
   ``So you had contradictory jury verdicts, making the matter
legally complicated. And then you had a very complex set of facts
... requiring the Senate to make a decision based on strong but
circumstantial evidence,'' said Bryant, a member of the Judiciary
Committee.
   Hastings, 53, was acquitted of the bribery-conspiracy charges in
a criminal trial six years ago.
   Bryant said he feels good about having fulfilled his
responsibility.
   ``I was asked to take this role (by Judiciary Chairman Jack
Brooks of Texas) and I knew it would be extremely controversial and
time consuming,'' he said.

   Hungary's largest opposition group
opened a national meeting Friday to decide on a campaign strategy
for next year's freely contested elections.
   The Democratic Forum began as a loose grouping of intellectuals,
artists and scientists in 1987 and since has grown to about 20,000
members.
   The three-day congress, the group's second national meeting,
opened as Hungary's parliament ended a landmark session in which it
adopted a package of laws designed to open the way for the first
multiparty elections in more than 40 years.
   In recent special elections for four parliament seats, Communist
Party candidates were defeated by candidates put up by the
Democratic Forum.
   In an opening address, Forum leader Gyoergy Szabad told the 850
delegates that ``people are beginning to feel confidence in
Hungarian democracy.''
   ``Let us change the course of history ... (and) make democracy a
permanent companion,'' he said.
   Szabad said the Forum ``went to the grass roots'' after decades
of Marxist-Leninist dictatorship and ``discovered new areas of
political and democratic culture in Hungary.''
   Delegations from the Polish Solidarity group and the West German
Christian Democratic Union are attending the congress as invited
guests, Forum spokesman Sandor Lezsak said.

   The State Department said Friday it will
respond to questions raised by Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of
Missouri and 28 other House members on the planned $3 billion sale
of 315 modern tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia.
   In a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Thursday, they asked if the purchase was in the U.S. strategic
interest, what armor would be included and where the tanks would be
deployed.
   Rep. Melvin Levine, D-Calif., questioned in an accompanying
letter whether the administration had conducted sufficient
consultation with Congress.
   ``In light of the fact that the Saudis have received over $30
billion worth of military goods and services in the past eight
years from the U.S.,'' Levine wrote, ``I am troubled that they
still have yet to meet many basic U.S. policy objectives in the
Middle East.''
   In a statement Friday, the department's press office called the
questions raised in the letter by the 29 members ``thoughtful and
reasonable.'' The statement added: ``We look forward to answering
them thoroughyl as we continue our consultations with the Hill
about this sale.''
   The purchase will go through unless it is rejected by majority
vote of both the Senate and the House.

   The estimated cost of California's
deadly earthquake rose to $5.5 billion Friday as state officials
received new reports of damage to businesses, public buildings,
homes and state highways and bridges.
   The pricetag of the disaster continues to grow and doesn't
include losses on many county roads left cracked from Tuesday's
quake that measured 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   ``The damage estimate is going up constantly as we get new
reports,'' Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Knudsen said. ``We
won't know the total damage for quite a while.''
   So far, Alameda County is estimating at least $1.3 billion in
losses in Oakland alone, while figures for the other parts of the
county which escaped with far less damage weren't immediately
calculated.
   The figure includes $30 million in damages to 1,400 homes and
$986 million in destruction of 213 private and commercial
businesses, according to Knudsen.
   The city-county of San Francisco, with its still-crippled Marina
district, estimated total damages at $2 billion.
   Affluent Marin County, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from
San Francisco, escaped relatively unscathed with an estimated $2
million in damages.
   ``We were extremely lucky,'' said Marin County Public Works
Director Mehdi Sadjadi. ``We feel that we have been under a lucky
star because we were spared.''
   Santa Cruz County, which continues to assess damage from,
reported as much as $750 million in damages as of Friday morning.
That includes $125 million in damaged public facilities, $400
million in destruction to private buildings and ``hundreds of
millions of dollars'' in damages to the city of Santa Cruz.
   Total damages reported by seven counties most affected amount to
about $4.5 billion. State transportation officials estimate losses
to state highways and buildings at between $500 million and $1
billion.
   The state Office of Emergency Services, which gets reports from
local agencies, has set the total damage estimate, exclusive of
state losses, at $4.2 billion.

   Scientists converged on the Santa
Cruz Mountains on Friday to look for the origins of Northern
California's killer earthquake as mountain residents resumed life
in the fault zone.
   Geologists were investigating whether a fissure hundreds of
yards long and as wide as 20 inches in some spots was in fact the
result of the San Andreas Fault rupturing to the surface.
   ``The question we're trying to answer is whether that break is
the primary fault or something else,'' said Tom Fumal, of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   Seismologists believe the infamous fault's southern Santa Cruz
Mountains segment was responsible for Tuesday's disastrous
6.9-magnitude quake. But doubts have been raised by their
difficulty finding where the fault broke through to the surface of
the ground.
   Finding the surface trace of the fault is important because it
would confirm the San Andreas indeed caused the quake. A 1988 USGS
report said the fault's Santa Cruz Mountains segment had a 30
percent chance of causing a strong quake within 30 years.
   If it turns out that Tuesday's quake was caused by some fault
other than the San Andreas, that risk likely would remain
unchanged. If the San Andreas did cause the quake, severe quakes on
that segment of the fault would be less likely in coming decades.
   By Friday afternoon, state geologists found fissures caused by
seismic ground settling. But they failed to turn up evidence that
the underground rupture of the San Andreas had broken to the
surface of the ground, said Max Flanery, of the California Division
of Mines and Geology in Sacramento.
   Tuesday's major quake should have caused ground on one side of
the fault to slip past the ground on the other side by at least
several inches to a few feet. But such ``offset'' was found only on
two cracked roads near the epicenter, and it totaled only a couple
of inches, said Bob Streitz, a geologist with the state.
   The aftershock zone from Tuesday's quake stretches from the
Lexington reservoir south of Los Gatos southward some 25 miles to
San Juan Bautista, so the fault could have broken through to the
surface along that line, Streitz said.
   USGS scientist David Schwartz said the actual fault rupture
causing the quake probably occurred as deep as 12 miles
underground. He said it is possible the breakage might not migrate
upward, or might take weeks to reach the surface. Some say rupture
of the San Andreas deep underground might cause several smaller
surface ruptures instead of a single crack in the soft soils at
surface level.
   The search for fissures has been complicated by the remote
region's thick brush and trees, mountainous terrain and difficult
access.
   The crack on which scientists focused Friday is about five miles
from the quake's epicenter. The fissure is nearly 17 feet deep at
one point, runs across a two-lane mountain road, and up Linda and
Roger Wolleson's gravel driveway, which they jokingly dubbed
``Allstate (insurance) Alley.''
   The Wollesons were not in their secluded home at the time of the
5:04 p.m earthquake. The temblor knocked their home off its
foundations and flipped their water bed mattress out of its frame.
   ``Most of the people up here are pretty sturdy and we'll try to
rebuild, but to know so many people who have to glue their lives
together is pretty impressive,'' Mrs. Wolleson said.
   The Wollesons, who have been living in their home shrouded by
redwoods for 16 years, were unaware of any fault beneath their
property.
   ``You know it's very beautiful here,'' Wolleson said, explaining
their decision to remain. ``We're just hoping the worst part is
over.''
   But Lucia Sutton, a longtime resident, said, ``My husband is
absolutely ready to leave this area. I've never seen my husband
shaking like he was and it wasn't because of the problems
yesterday. He was just so mad and he just wanted out.''

   Sir Anthony Quayle, the actor-director who built
Stratford-upon-Avon into a center of British theater, died Friday
at his home. He was 76.
   Quayle had been suffering from cancer, said his agent, Laurence
Evans.
   A versatile classical actor who created a memorable ``Falstaff''
at Stratford in 1951, Quayle had been in the theater nearly 40
years before tasting box office success with his role in ``Sleuth''
in London and New York in 1970.
   His distinguished film credits included Alfred Hitchcock's ``The
Wrong Man,'' ``The Guns of Navarone,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and
``Anne of a Thousand Days,'' which brought him an Academy Award
nomination for his role as Cardinal Wolsey.
   In 1985, Quayle joined the distinguished company of
actor-knights that has included Laurence Olivier, Alec Guinness,
John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, John Mills and, most recently, Rex
Harrison.
   On Friday, Britain's finest actors gathered at Westminster Abbey
for a memorial service in honor of Olivier, who died July 11 at 82.
   Quayle was due to return to the London stage this fall in
``Never the Sinner,'' a courtroom drama by Chicago playwright John
Logan. He bowed out prior to rehearsals due to poor health and the
West End run was indefinitely postponed.
   He had stepped down in July as director of Compass, a touring
company he founded in 1984, and was succeeded by Tim Pigott-Smith.
   Gielgud praised Quayle as ``very fair, very unbitchy, very
uninterested in gossip and always in a good humor, amusing and
understanding.''
   ``He was a dear fellow,'' Gielgud said Friday night in an
interview with Independent Television News.
   Quayle made his first appearance on the London stage in 1931,
and was a stalwart of the Old Vic company for several seasons. He
made his American debut in 1936 in ``The Country Wife,'' which
starred Ruth Gordon.
   He made his debut as a director in 1946 in a London production
of ``Crime and Punishment'' starring Gielgud, Peter Ustinov and
Edith Evans.
   He became director of the Shakespeare Memorial Theater in
Stratford in 1948, appearing that first season as Petruchio in
``The Taming of the Shrew.'' He played Falstaff in both parts of
``Henry IV'' in 1951 and in ``The Merry Wives of Windsor'' in 1955.
   He secured the theater's reputation by luring Olivier,
Richardson, Gielgud and other top names to Stratford, where they
were paid minimum wages.
   ``You have to set an example _ a merry example, I hope,'' Quayle
said of his time at Stratford, which continued until 1956.
   ``In the war there was a thing called man management. It only
amounted to a mixture of firmness and sympathy. If you treat people
as if they are doing their best for you, then they will do their
best for you,'' Quayle said in an interview this summer with The
Independent newspaper.
   Yet as a manager or director, Quayle admitted, he sometimes
believed he had been ``pouring creativity into others at the
expense of my own.''
   Quayle said after the stage success of ``Sleuth'' that he had
always had to supplement his stage income with work in television
and films. ``I was in the Tarzan films, and ``Fall of the Roman
Empire,' and one dreary thing after another,'' he said.
   Other Broadway appearances included Bertolt Brecht's
``Galileo,'' Ustinov's ``Up the Tree'' in 1967 and Christopher
Marlowe's ``Tamburlaine the Great'' in 1956.
   During World War II, Quayle served in the Royal Artillery and
spent six months organizing partisan guerrilla forces behind German
lines in Albania.
   He is survived by his second wife, Dorothy, an American actress
he married in 1947, two daughters and a son. His first marriage
ended in divorce.
   Morton Gottlieb, one of the producers of ``Sleuth,'' which ran
for 1,222 performances in New York, recalled Quayle as ``a
wonderful actor.''
   ``There are some actors who have a certain personality and no
matter what the role is, that personality takes over the stage,''
Gottlieb said. ``But Tony Quayle would fit into whatever the role
and characterization was rather than imposing a certain persona on
the play and the audience. Sometimes with big stars that doesn't
happen.''

   Dan Ben-Amotz, a bohemian author who was a
cultural symbol for a generation of modern Israelis, died Friday of
liver cancer at the age of 66.
   In April, Ben-Amotz threw a gala party at a nightclub after
doctors diagnosed his cancer as incurable. He read a farewell
letter to 300 friends and socialites who gathered to give their
final regards.
   To many Israelis, the husky, bearded Ben-Amotz was a cultural
icon who set the style for sabras, as native-born Israelis are
called. The term comes from the prickly cactus fruit that is tough
on the outside and sweet on the inside.
   ``He helped create the sabra personality,'' said Zeev Chafetz,
an author. ``He was brash, direct, unpretentious, idealistic in
some ways, and naive in other ways.''
   But Ben-Amotz, a Jewish refugee who was born Moishe
Tehilimzunger in Poland and lost his parents in the Holocaust, also
symbolized modern Israeli Jews trying to reject their tragic
European past.
   Ben-Amotz published ``To Remember and To Forget,'' his first
full-scale novel, in 1968. In the book he tried to confront such
questions as his European past and German guilt over the Holocaust.
   As did many immigrants who came to Israel between the 1930s and
1950s, doubling the state's Jewish population, Ben-Amotz adopted a
new name.
   He made his impact on Israeli society through his radio talk
show in the 1950s called ``Three Men in a Boat.'' The popular show
was one of the first Israeli broadcasts to reject the formal Hebrew
of the state's founders and use the common language of the streets.
   Ben-Amotz was widely considered one of the pioneers in the
revival of modern Hebrew from a dormant language of prayer and
study.
   He authored a dictionary of Hebrew slang, wrote articles and
novels that shocked many Israelis with their frankness _ even their
titles contained obscenities. He also was instrumental in
developing modern Israeli theater.
   Ben-Amotz immigrated in 1933 and studied agriculture on a
collective farm before joining the Palyam, a naval detatchment of
the Jewish underground Palmach militia.
   He was active after World War II in smuggling Jewish refugees
and weapons to the infant state.
   In his later years he worked as a columnist for Israeli
newspapers and was a fixture on the Tel Aviv social scene.
   Ben-Amotz is survived by four children; three live in the United
States and one lives in Israel.

<TEXT>
   An Australian Cabinet minister said Friday the
United States intends to unveil next week ``a radical and very
positive'' initiative for dismantling agricultural trade barriers
around the world.
   ``The U.S. is now really throwing the ball into other people's
courts,'' and Australia, a foe of farm price subsidies, welcomes
it, said Michael J. Duffy, minister for trade negotiations.
   He told reporters that members of President Bush's Cabinet
outlined for him the U.S. negotiating document to be presented in
Geneva in preparation for the forthcoming final round of global
trade negotiations but did not provide details.
   ``It's clear that the U.S. is committed to genuine reform and
liberalization of agricultural trade,'' he added.
   The minister said he learned in talks with U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter that the initiative will address realistically all aspects
of the problem of freeing world farm production and trade from
subsidies and market barriers, a goal former President Reagan said
should be achieved by the end of the century.

<HEAD>Leader of Two Army Rebellions Forced to Retire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army command forced the
retirement Friday of Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led two insurrections
that endangered the government of former President Raul Alfonsin.
   Gen. Isidro Caceres, appointed army commander earlier this year,
issued the order affecting Rico and four other leaders of a January
1988 revolt, the government news agency Telam reported.
   President Carlos Menem must approve the action, but he said
Thursday: ``It doesn't matter to me what names are included. I'll
sign it.''
   Rico, 44, led soldiers who took over part of the Campo de Mayo
army base on the outskirts of Buenos Aires in April 1987, and
another rebellion nine months later at the Monte Caseros base in
northeastern Corrientes Province.
   He demanded an end to trials in civilian courts of officers
accused of violating human rights during the ``dirty war''
conducted against leftists while the military ruled Argentina in
1976-83.
   Rico, Lt. Col. Arturo Gonzalez Naya and the other three were
cashiered after the revolts, but their ranks were restored later so
military courts could try them.
   Menem pardoned them Oct. 7 in a group of 39 colonels, generals
and vice admirals accused of kidnapping, torture and murder under
military rule.
   He also pardoned 64 alleged leftist guerrillas, 174 officers
accused in the rebellions and three _ including former President
Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri _ convicted of misconduct in the disastrous
Falkland Islands war with Britain in 1982.
   Menem intended the sweeping amnesty to cool passions that led to
the rebellions, street demonstrations, bitter debates in Congress
and scattered violence.
   Marta Gaston Alfonso of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,
relatives whose children disappeared during the ``dirty war,'' said
1 million people had signed anti-amnesty petitions that would be
presented to Menem.
   Rico has wide support among junior officers in the 85,000-man
military, who feel the campaign against leftists was a kind of
civil war and deserves gratitude, not censure.
   An investigation conducted by Alfonsin's government found that
about 9,000 people disappeared and were presumed dead. Rights
groups say 30,000 is more accurate.

<HEAD>Long Process To Sue The State, Which Has Design Defect Immunity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If victims of the San Francisco area
earthquake decide to sue the state for injuries, losses or
relatives' deaths caused by the collapse of state-built structures,
they face a long and complex process.
   State law gives the state design defect immunity. That means the
state cannot be sued because of a basic defect in the design of a
public works project, such as a highway.
   ``That will be an issue'' in any lawsuits filed relating to the
collapses of sections of Interstate 880 freeway or the Bay Bridge,
said Alan Ashby, spokesman fir the state attorney general.
   Victims who believe the state was to blame for their losses
can't go into court as quickly as if they were suing a private
person or business.
   ``Before you can sue the state, you have to file a claim,'' said
Curt Sonderland of the state Board of Control. Nobody has yet filed
a claim with the state relating to the earthquake.
   The Board of Control staff looks at the claim, solicits a
response from the state department allegedly at fault, and makes a
recommendation to the board. The board has three members, the
director of the General Services Department, the controller and a
governor's appointee.
   The board then decides whether to pay the claim. The payment
must be approved by the Legislature.
   However, Sonderland said that the board routinely rejects a
claim, such as one that might arise from the bridge or I-880
collapse, if it is ``a complex issue of fact and-or law.''
   ``This enables the individual to sue the state and go directly
to court,'' he said.
   He said it normally takes the board 45 to 60 days to process a
claim.
   He said the board was never intended to determine complex legal
liability questions and its members are not judges.
   Civil lawsuit settlements or judgments would also have to be
approved by the Legislature, which has rejected both claims and
lawsuit judgments in the past. The plaintiff has little recourse if
the Legislature rejects the payment, said Ashby.
   The largest judgment the state has had to pay was about $4
million for damages in the 1965 Crescent City floods, he said.
Lawsuits relating to the 1986 floods are still pending, he said.

   President Bush inspected the ravages of the
Northern California earthquake Friday, breathing a single word _
``Jesus'' _ when he got his first look at the collapsed freeway
still covering uncounted bodies. He promised all-out federal help
with ``no red tape.''
   ``It's been a very moving day,'' the president said at the end
of a four-hour tour of the region that gave him first-hand look at
some of the areas that were hardest hit by the quake.
   Bush said he was ``willing to do what's needed to be done,'' as
he faced repeated questions from local officials about how much
recovery money the government would provide _ and when. He offered
no details on the size of the federal contribution to relief
efforts.
   Commenting ``there's no ceiling on the compassion of the
American people,'' Bush declined on several occasions to rule out
the possibility of of tax increases to pay for recovery costs.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, one of three mayors accompanying
the president on his tour, told him: ``We need fast action. We need
checks written on the spot.''
   ``We will do what is necessary to fulfill our responsibility,''
said the president, flanked by state and federal officials.
   Bush said that government officials on all levels needed to
cooperate, that ``we've got to work with each other.''
   ``In terms of what it will cost, I don't know,'' he said. But he
added that Washington will work with local and state governments
``to see the suffering is alleviated, the restoration begins.''
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, newly designated to
head federal quake-recovery efforts, promised the U.S. government
was prepared to play ``a very very major role in helping
California.''
   Accompanied by state officials as well as the mayors of San
Francisco, Oakland and Alameda, Bush flew over some of the
hardest-hit areas by helicopter and visited the collapsed
double-decker expressway in Oakland in which an unknown number of
rush-hour motorists are feared still entombed.
   He also visited San Francisco and inspected damage in the
coastal city of Santa Cruz, near the epicenter of Tuesday's
powerful earthquake.
   The president said ``the most touching moment'' of his visit was
when he talked to the doctor who rescued young Julio Berumen from a
crushed car. The doctor had to amputate the boy's leg to get him
free.
   ``I had the opportunity to talk to the dad who was at the
bedside of this 6-year-old boy and I had a chance to tell him that
the American people were rooting for him, to tell his dad that we
all care,'' Bush said.
   In his first stop, Bush walked tieless and wearing a flight
jacket with the presidential seal slowly alongside the collapsed
freeway where workers with heavy machinery are trying to extricate
the bodies from cars crushed between the two decks.
   The ground was covered with rubble, including massive chunks of
concrete and giant fallen pillars. Twisted steel girders protruded
from the structure. Smashed cars were visible between the upper and
lower decks.
   ``I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very
stimulated by this team effort,'' the president said.
   He complimented rescue teams and added that he admired ``the way
this community is pulling together. ... We'll see what we can do to
be part of the answer.''
   He questioned the propriety of his own visit, saying, ``I had a
doubt, is it proper for me to come here? If you do, they say you're
getting in the way of the lifting or the building or the
fire-fighting or whatever.'' But he added, ``If you don't go _ why
it's neglect.''
   Bush also taped a public service television announcement
offering encouragement to Bay area residents and urging Americans
around the nation to contribute to volunteer organizations.
   Bush, who won office on a firm pledge of no new taxes, said,
``I'm going to do what is necessary to have the federal government
fulfill its obligation,'' and repeated substantially the same
phrase when asked if that meant new taxes.
   Gov. George Deukmejian has said he is willing to face a state
tax increase, if necessary, and U.S. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., said Thursday the House would vote relief funds regardless
of what it did to the federal deficit.
   In Washington, House Democrats are working on a $2.5 billion
relief package. But Skinner, talking with reporters aboard Air
Force One on the flight west, said, ``I don't know where they got''
that figure, and local officials had raised damage estimates to
$5.5 billion on Friday.
   Administration officials, speaking only on the condition of
anonymity, said the White House request to Congress would likely
far surpass the $1.1 billion voted to help Hurricane Hugo victims.
   In a meeting with local officials at Moffett Naval Air Station,
Bush promised the relief effort would not become bogged down in red
tape.
   ``You can't have every `t' crossed and every `i' dotted,'' Bush
said.
   San Francisco Mayor Agnos, a Democrat who had criticized Vice
President Dan Quayle for not visiting him on his trip Wednesday,
told Bush that his city was ``90 percent back to normal.'' Still,
he said, referring to the obvious damage, ``when you walk this
ground, you feel it in your gut.''
   Dennis Kwaitkowski, assistant associate director of the Federal
Emergency Management Administration, told reporters that FEMA would
likely need close to $1 billion alone for its relief efforts here _
and that doesn't include major construction repairs.
   Kwaitkowski said FEMA plans to open 10 disaster centers in the
area on Sunday _ and eventually planned to have a total of 20 open,
including three mobile units.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian called the federal response so
far ``tremendous'' but said the state's $1 billion reserve fund
would be soon depleted. ``We're probably looking at $3 billion or
so'' in total damage, he told Bush.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., told reporters here that the total
damage costs will run between $8 billion and $10 billion _ of which
he said the federal government should pay between $5 billion and $6
billion.
   He said he did not foresee a clash between Congress and Bush
over the amount of the aid package. ``The fact that the president
responded so quickly means that any kind of partisanship is out of
the question.''

<TEXT>
   A courageous calico cat took a flying leap and
sent a pit bull dog running when it tried to beat up a poodle.
   Teresa Harper's 4-year-old feline, named Sparky, became a local
hero after saving her owner's poodle named Lacy Jane from the jaws
of the pit bull.
   ``I feel she's definitely a hero,'' said Mrs. Harper. ``My
poodle would be dead otherwise.''
   Mrs. Harper said she let her dog out this week and seconds later
heard a commotion. She rushed to the door and was paralyzed with
fear when she saw Lacy Jane being attacked by a stray pit bull.
   But Sparky, perched 10 feet above the fray, flew into action.
   ``She made a flying leap, just as pretty as you please, and she
landed right on that dog's head,'' her owner said. ``She just
clawed and scratched and clawed and scratched.''
   The pit bull ran off to take cover. Mrs. Harper snatched the
wounded Lacy Jane, blood flowing from a gash in her neck and raced
to a veterinarian.
   ``The poodle had a puncture wound on the right side,'' said
Vicky Moorehead, a Sumiton Animal Clinic employee. ``It would have
been killed if it hadn't have been for that cat. This is just
amazing.''

   Millions of dollars and offers of everything from clothing to
chiropractors flowed into Northern California on Friday as
thousands of refugees from quake-buckled homes waited anxiously in
makeshift shelters.
   Relief officials worried that the aid, though widespread, wasn't
enough to fill the needs of what by some estimates could be the
most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history.
   ``What we need is cash,'' said Laurie Levy, spokesperson for the
Red Cross chapter in San Francisco, which was routing donations of
food, clothing, blankets and other goods to the Salvation Army and
other aid groups.
   Red Cross officials said most donations were welcome but some
were ill-considered in the immediate wake of the disaster. One
company, for example, volunteered caseloads of rarely used D-size
batteries. In Lansing, Mich., the Michigan Chiropractic Society
offered its services.
   ``At least in the first seven days we have to be handling
people's absolute basic life needs: food, clothing and shelter,''
said Chris Garrett, public information director for the Red Cross
in San Francisco.
   ``We need toilet paper, plastic spoons and paper plates and
those kinds of things,'' she said. Computers and fax machines were
also being sought to enable the agency to compile lists of the
dead, injured and homeless, Ms. Garrett said.
   ``Every country in the world is calling for information,'' she
said.
   But the most urgent requirement was for money to help relocate
homeless families from shelters to temporary living quarters such
as hotels, Ms. Levy said. As of Friday morning, 5,000 people were
housed in 30 shelters in the region affected by Tuesday's quake,
the Red Cross said.
   Overall, an estimated 12,550 people were displaced, according to
the state Office of Emergency Services.
   Offers of money came from several multinational corporations,
some with long-term ties to the Bay area, as well as smaller
pockets. In Bloomington, Ind., two radio stations raised $40,120 in
an all-day pledge-a-thon. A Tucson, Ariz, hairstylist announced she
would hold a cut-a-thon Sunday and donate the $5-a-head proceeds.
   Perhaps the biggest private donation came Friday from the Los
Angeles-based Ralph M. Parsons foundation, funded by the estate of
the late engineer, which gave $1 million _ $750,000 to the Red
Cross and $250,000 to the Salvation Army.
   As of Friday, about $7 million had been pledged to the Red Cross
alone, Ms. Garrett said.
   Japan's Sony Corp. and its subsidiary, Sony Corp. of America,
offered $1 million in aid.
   ``We share the shock and grief of those who have suffered as a a
result of the earthquake,'' said Neil Vander Dussen, president of
the Park Ridge, N.J.-based subsidiary.
   Another Japanese giant, Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., which owns the San
Francisco-based Bank of California, said it would give $300,000 to
the Red Cross and $100,000 each to the police and fire departments
of San Francisco and Oakland.
   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank announced a $1 million
grant program to help communities rebuild. The bank also planned to
give a $250,000 grant to the Red Cross.
   Ford Motor Co. said it was donating $300,000 to the Red Cross
and $200,000 to the Santa Clara County United Way, and General
Motors offered $500,000 to the Red Cross. Procter &amp; Gamble
announced it had donated food and other products valued at more
than $300,000.
   Many people, however, simply loaned a hand. The Red Cross has
been deluged with 5,000 volunteers, Ms. Garrett said. Indeed, for a
time there were more volunteers than homeless.
   ``The ironic thing is that yesterday we had more people coming
in to volunteer than we had a need for'' she said, adding that
officials were concerned that ``as soon as the thrill is gone, the
volunteers will disappear.''
   ``For a month, we'll have a huge need for volunteers,'' she said.
   The Soviet government, offering a return favor for the millions
of dollars and thousands of foreign rescuers and doctors that
poured into Armenia after December's earthquake, volunteered to
send doctors, geologists and rescue workers to San Francisco, Tass
reported Friday.
   Red Cross officials, noting that Thursday was the one-month
anniversary of Hurricane Hugo's assault on South Carolina, said the
quake would be a crushing burden to what what was already the
highest-ever relief bill in the organization's 108-year history.
   ``In 1906, the Red Cross spent $9 million on earthquake relief
in San Francisco. There's 50 times more population now and a wider
area affected. Just with inflation alone you can begin to conjure
up astronomical figures,'' said Ms. Garrett.
   With damage estimates already at more than $5.5 billion, the
earthquake was the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history
with the possible exception of the 1906 quake, according to the
Independent Insurance Agents of America, a trade group based in
Washington.
   The 1906 devastation cost up to $5.8 billion in current dollars,
said Becky Newman, a spokeswoman for the group. A private
economist, Frank McCormick of Bank of America in San Francisco,
said damage from Tuesday's quake is likely to reach $10 billion.

   Riot troops fired on striking government
workers on Friday, wounding 10 people, including a local television
reporter, police said.
   The shooting broke out after someone in the crowd of strikers
threw a stick of dynamite that exploded near a line of policemen.
Police said the dynamite was thrown by a leftist rebel who had
infiltrated the march in downtown Lima, seven blocks from
Government Palace.
   A police spokesman initially said it was unknown who fired the
shots that wounded the 10. He said police had been ordered not to
shoot at strikers.
   But police investigators who inspected the site later said they
found shell casings that matched the type of arms used by riot
police.
   Government workers are demanding higher pay, and Friday's
protest was a rejection of a 50 percent wage increase announced by
the government Wednesday. Strikers said the increase would amount
to less than 10 percent when measured against rising inflation.
   Juan Manuel Guimarey, a reporter covering the strike for Channel
9 Television, was shot in the arm and slightly wounded by the
gunfire. A spokesman for the Lima station said Guimarey told
colleagues he did not see who shot him.

   Much of the South and the Gulf Coast shivered as the mercury
plunged Friday, snapping low-temperature records in 38 cities and
tying them in seven others. The chilly weather was expected to
continue into Saturday.
   The low temperatures followed a storm that dumped more than 8
inches of snow on north-central Indiana by Friday morning and 2 to
6 inches over much of Illinois, Ohio, southern Michigan and
southeast Wisconsin.
   Snow fell in the mountains of northern Georgia and North
Carolina during the morning. Snowfall was generally light, although
there was a two-inch accumulation at Beach Mountain, N.C., by
Friday afternoon.
   In the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT, 2 inches of snow fell in
Marquette, Mich.; 5 inches in South Bend, Ind; 3 inches in
Milwaukee and 1 inch in Fort Wayne, Ind., and Wausau, Wis.
   Snow, often mixed with rain, fell from Wisconsin and Michigan to
northern and west central Illinois. Rain, mixed with snow at higher
elevations, extended from northern Tennessee to eastern Kentucky
and southwestern West Virginia. Rain and occasional thunderstorms
reached from New York state to central New England and fell over
the northern coast of North Carolina.
   Flood watches were posted for sections of New Jersey, Rhode
Island and Pennsylvania.
   Winds gusted to around 35 mph in Knoxville, Tenn., and gusty
winds raised blowing dust in the southern San Joaquin Valley in
California.
   Low-temperature records up to 72 years old were broken or tied
across the South.
   In Lake Charles, La., the temperature hit 32 degrees, snapping
the mark of 35 degrees set in 1939 and setting a record low for the
month. It was 32 degrees in Little Rock, Ark., the earliest freeze
ever recorded in that city.
   A low of 22 degrees in Ozark, Ark., beat by 8 degrees the record
set back in 1917.
   Records were also set in Pensacola, Fla. (35 degrees, 42 in
1981), Mobile, Ala. (33 degrees, 39 in 1964) and Mena, Ark. (24, 30
in 1925 and 1966).
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees in Kalamazoo and Marquette, Mich., to 87 degrees in Yuma,
Ariz.

<TEXT>
   Japan, the world's leading buyer of ivory, is
studying whether it will join a ban on ivory trade approved this
week at a conference of 91 nations, a government spokesman said
Friday.
   The head of Japan's Environment Agency urged Cabinet members at
a meeting to support the ban to avoid ``international isolation''
on the issue.
   The government Japan is still studying the issue, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe later told reporters.
   ``We have not yet reached a conclusion, but we are aware of the
consensus in Switzerland,'' Watanabe said.
   In Lausanne, Switzerland, the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species voted Monday to put the elephant on the
endangered species list, thereby banning ivory trade. Japan, a
convention member, abstained from the vote.
   The convention voted Thursday to extend the ban to existing
stocks of ivory.
   Convention members have the right to ask for exemptions to
rulings and several southern African nations have indicated they
will do so.
   Japan has ``sizable stocks'' of ivory, Watanabe said. The World
Wide Fund for Nature estimates Japan has about 100 tons of raw
ivory.
   Japan has regularly purchased about 40 percent of the world's
ivory exports, the largest quantity for a single country.

   The heroic rescue of 6-year-old Julio
Berumen, who could be saved from a mangled car only by amputating
his leg and sawing in half the body of his dead mother, has sent
waves of sympathy rippling across the nation.
   The hospital where the boy and his sister are recovering is
tallying toys and phone calls, and a fund has been set up for Julio.
   ``The story just brought us back to reality about how important
life is,'' said Heidi Palkowitz, who brought stuffed animals for
Julio and his 8-year-old sister, Cathy, who was also pulled from
the family's crushed car.
   ``You never know if that was going to be one of your family,''
Ms. Palkowitz said.
   Julio was reported to be conscious Friday. Cathy was in fair
condition with head injuries.
   The boy was one of the last survivors pulled from the debris of
two-tiered Interstate 880 after it buckled and tumbled during
Tuesday's earthquake.
   The story of the four-hour, flood-lit rescue, including a
doctor's skill and courage, brought calls from throughout the
country to a bank, where a trust fund has been established.
   ``The phone has been ringing off the hook,'' said Jerry Barnes,
a vice president at Summit Bank in Oakland.
   Rescuers who reached Maria Berumen's car Tuesday were able to
remove Cathy, but Julio was pinned in by his mother's seat.
   Doctors decided they had to saw through the seat and Mrs.
Berumen's body to get to Julio, and then found that Julio's right
leg was pinned under a highway pillar that had fallen on the car.
   Dr. Jim Betts, lying on a board pushed into a narrow opening
carved in the debris, performed the operation in about 10 minutes.
The doctors used local anesthetic and pumped morphine and Valium
intravenously into the boy's system.
   After more than four hours, Julio was finally freed from the
mangled car and taken to the hospital. He had surgery Wednesday,
but surgeons did not have to amputate his other leg.
   ``This was your worst nightmare,'' Betts said Thursday. ``I'd do
it again. I know if I was up there or one of my family members was
up there, I'd want them to do it.''
   Children's Hospital, where Julio's father, Pastor Berumen, and
several friends and relatives waited, was deluged with similar
calls of support and sympathy.
   Hospital officials said Berumen, of Richmond, was aware of the
attention his son had attracted, but wanted to stay out of the
public spotlight.
   ``He's very much in touch with this, but in his grief, he has
asked everyone to leave,'' said hospital spokesman Dennis Green.
   President Bush met Betts on his tour of the earthquake-ravaged
area and talked with Berumen by telephone at his son's bedside.
   ``The most touching moment was ... when this doctor, this
marvelously heroic doctor and his associate told me of pulling a
kid out and having to amputate his leg to get him out of this
crushed car,'' Bush said.
   Green said Berumen had been at the hospital almost constantly
since the accident and was being supported by relatives, friends
and hospital counselors.
   Julio's classmates at the year-round Downer Elementary School in
San Pablo are on a vacation break, but officials said they were
already making plans to help the family.
   Noraleen Dowell, a school secretary, said Downer's parent club
was going to hold a benefit raffle on Nov. 15, with proceeds going
to a fund for the family.

<TEXT>
   When federal judge Alcee Hastings' eight-year legal
battle over a bribery charge ended Friday with a U.S. Senate vote
to remove him from the bench, he immediately announced he would run
for governor.
   Hastings _ outspoken, witty and a dynamic speaker _ almost never
evokes a neutral reaction from those around him, and the latest
events were no exception.
   Hastings' ouster 10 years after President Carter made him
Florida's first black U.S. District judge sparked an angry reaction
from blacks, and his political announcement surprised Florida
politicians.
   The ouster ``sends a shocking and chilling message to black
folks all over the country that we have not overcome yet,'' said
Dorsey Miller, a Miami physician and longtime Hastings supporter.
   ``It's a definite travesty to our justice system,'' said
Roosevelt Walters, head of the Fort Lauderdale branch of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``We
have to wonder who is next? Who will be singled out?''
   ``We must question whether justice was truly served by the
Senate action,'' Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a
statement issued in Baltimore.
   Hooks said the Senate's action, ``in my view, constitutes double
jeopardy and this flies in the face of the foundation that buttress
our legal system.''
   Hastings, 53, was removed for allegedly conspiring to take a
$150,000 payoff to fix a court case.
   A federal jury in Miami acquitted him in 1983. But a subsequent
investigation led to his impeachment last year in the House, which
accused him of plotting to obtain a bribe, lying during his trial
and an unrelated charge of improperly disclosing federal wiretap
information.
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., voted for impeachment last year while
still a representative, but did not vote in the Senate. Florida's
other senator, Democrat Bob Graham, voted in Hastings' favor,
saying there was no clear and convincing evidence of his guilt.
   Hastings had said he would have announcement that could blunt
angry reaction to the Senate vote, but his gubernatorial bid was
unexpected.
   ``This ranks up there as one of the most bizarre'' political
events in Florida, said Jon Peck, a spokesman for Republican Gov.
Bob Martinez, who is up for re-election next year.
   ``Based on that track record, he's going to run for governor?''
Peck asked. ``Anybody who wants to is welcome to run for governor.
They'll have to take on an incumbent who is going to get
re-elected.''
   Martinez, who was on a glass-bottom boat off Key Largo with U.S.
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, laughed when told of Hastings'
announcement.
   ``You'll have to ask George Stuart and Bill Nelson about that,''
he said, referring to the Democrats in the race.
   State Democratic Party Chairman Simon Ferro had not heard of the
announcement Friday morning when asked to comment on Hastings' plan
to run for governor.
   ``Of what?'' Ferro asked.
   ``I would certainly like to sit down with him to assess his
opportunities and his chances and how they might affect the race,''
Ferro said. ``That's about as much as I can tell you at this
point.''
   Martinez faces a challenge from within his own party from state
Sen. Marlene Woodson-Howard. U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson and Orlando
attorney George Stuart are running as Democrats.
   Nelson's campaign manager, Ted Phelps, said Hastings' ouster did
not seem like an opportune time to announce for governor.
   Stuart was out of town and could not be reached for comment.
   Phelps said he believes Hastings has ``a small following'' and
will get some votes, ``but I do not think he will be a serious
contender.''
   The Senate's action saddened those who had worked with the
judge, whose outspoken style has won over many people and alienated
others.
   ``I am personally very sorry,'' said Acting Chief Judge William
Hoeveler. ``We will miss him.''

<HEAD>Dissident Academy Members Speak Out, Welcome Choice of Cela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two dissident members partly lifted the
veil of secrecy on the Swedish Academy Friday and said they had
lobbied for years to give the Nobel Prize for literature to Spanish
writer Camilo Jose Cela.
   Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten boycotted the vote of the
18-member Academy because of a dispute over its refusal to condemn
death threats against British author Salman Rushdie for allegedly
blaspheming Islam in his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The Academy's deliberations are protected by Swedish secrecy
laws for 50 years and members are bound by an even stricter code of
silence forbidding comments on decisons.
   Ekman, Gyllensten and a third dissident member, Werner
Aspenstrom, handed in letters of resignation, but the academy
rejected the move because members are elected for life.
   There was no immediate comment from the Academy on the comments
by Ekman and Gyllensten, who said they welcomed the choice of Cela,
73, announced Thursday.
   ``He has been one of my main candidates for some years back. He
is a very original writer with a very broad range,'' Gyllensten
said on Swedish Radio. ``I think he will be regarded as one of the
finer choices of Nobel laureates the Academy has made.''
   ``I have been one of those working for this prize and I'm very
glad that it came about,'' Ekman told the radio.
   Olof Lagercrantz, author and a former editor-in-chief of the
influential Dagens Nyheter daily, said the Nobel Prize is ``a
lottery unworthy of the world of the spirit'' and should be
discontinued.
   Asked his view of Cela, he said, ``I have no view at all. I have
not read a single line by him. It is so silly this prize that you
cannot have a view on it.''

   Amtrak said Friday it will add three
high-speed express Metroliner trains between Washington and New
York to compete with the airlines.
   Some members of the New Jersey congressional delegation
immediately protested to Amtrak their state was being neglected
because none of the new trains will stop there.
   Starting Oct. 30, the new trains, one northbound and two
southbound, will make the 225-mile run in 2 hours, 35 minutes to 2
hours, 40 minutes. One will run non-stop and the other two will
make only one stop, at New Carrollton, Md., in the Washington
suburbs. The only existing express Metroliner stops only at New
Carrollton on its 2-hour, 40-minute northbound trip.
   The expresses will give out free newspapers like the shuttle.
Northbound expresses will sell New York subway tokens; southbound
expresses will sell Washington subway fare cards.
   With a fare of $74 one-way vs. the shuttle's $99 at rush hour,
Amtrak is hoping to attract more passengers. The new expresses are
15 to 20 minutes faster than regular Metroliners, 55 minutes faster
than regular trains, and are close to the time needed by air when
airport-to-city center segments are included.
   ``We feel we need to remain competitive with the airlines,''
said spokesman Clifford Black. ``We feel it will improve our
revenues,'' and the current number of Metroliner stops in New
Jersey is not being reduced.
   Still, Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, a New Jersey Republican on the
transportation subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee,
said, ``They're trying to compete with Trump Airlines by blazing
through New Jersey. But the few minutes it takes to pick up
passengers in Metropark or Newark would hardly matter.''
   He said adding a New Jersey stop would add less than 10 minutes
to the journey time.
   ``This decision by your office is a short-sighted effort that
disserves the Newark-New York metropolitan area,'' Rinaldo said in
a letter to Amtrak president W. Graham Claytor Jr. that was signed
by five other members of the state's 14-member House delegation.

<TEXT>
   An artillery accident that killed three
soldiers has been blamed on the use of too much powder, and two
solidiers have been charged with negligent homicide and dereliction
of duty, the Army said Friday.
   The howitzer round strayed off target, and exploded behind a
group of about 80 soldiers, who were standing in formation to leave
a rifle range Sept. 27. Four of the 24 injured soldiers remained
hospitalized Friday.
   Sgt. Edward C. Tyler, 26, of Washington, D.C., and Spec.
Nickoles W. Holly, 24, of Canton, Ohio, were charged in military
court, said Fort Sill spokeswoman Sheil Samples.
   Tyler, a howitzer battery section chief, and Holly, a No. 2
cannoneer, are accused of using too much powder, which the Army
said caused the 105mm howitzer round to land outside the designated
impact area.
   Ms. Samples said the amount of powder was not being released.
   The stray round created a 2-foot wide, 1-foot deep crater behind
the soldiers, who were in the seventh week of an eight-week
training program at the sprawling Field Artillery Center in
southwest Oklahoma.
   Tyler and Holly were not in confinement Friday and were
performing their duties, but they were not firing cannons, Ms.
Samples said.
   The charges were read to the men by their battery commander
Wednesday. The case will be referred to Maj. Gen. Raphael J.
Hallada, the Fort Sill commander, who will determine the
disposition of charges.
   If a general court-martial is convened, the maximum sentence the
men could receive if convicted of dereliction of duty through
negligence would be three months confinement and loss of
three-fourths of their pay and allowances for three months, Ms.
Samples said.
   If convicted of negligent homicide, the maximum sentence would
be a bad-conduct discharge, one year of confinement and total loss
of pay and allowance for that year, she said.
   If convicted of both charges, the maximum sentence would be a
bad conduct discharge, 15 months confinement and total loss of pay
and allowances, she said.

   An early morning quake shook the hill country south
of Rome, creating panic and minor structural damage to buildings
but authorities said no injuries were reported.
   Local police and fire departments said hundreds of residents of
the Alban Hills called in to say they were frightened by the
temblor, which lasted about 10 seconds.
   ``The San Francisco effect and the fact it happened during the
night caused the worry,'' the Italian news agency ANSA quoted an
official of the Civil Defense Ministry as saying, referring to the
quake that struck the Bay area this week.
   The temblor, which shook an area about 15 miles south of Rome,
registered 6 to 7 on the 12-point Mercalli scale. An earthquake of
that magnitude can cause serious damage. The Mercalli and Richter
scales are not convertible.
   Firemen said the walls of hospitals in Rocca di Papa and Albano
sustained minor cracks but no major structural damage.

moment'' during his Friday tour of quake devastation was talking to
the father of a 6-year-old boy pulled from a crushed car and to the
doctors who had to amputate his leg to free him.
   Bush, after a visit to collapsed Interstate Highway 880 here,
talked with Dr. James Betts, the surgeon who performed the
operation, and by phone with the boy's father, Pastor Berumen, who
was at his son's bedside.
   ``So this human dimension is brought home much more clearly by
coming here,'' Bush told reporters in remarks at nearby Moffett
Naval Air Station in Mountain View.
   ``The most touching moment was ... when this doctor, this
marvelously heroic doctor and his associate told me of pulling a
kid out and having to amputate his leg to get him out of this
crushed car,'' Bush said.
   Bush said he then talked to the father at the boy's bedside
``and I had a chance to tell him that the American people were
rooting for him, to tell his dad that we all care.''
   Julio Berumen and his 8-year-old sister, Cathy, were trapped in
a car that had been crushed when the two-tier elevated expressway
collpased when the earthquake struck.
   The children's mother and a friend had been killed instantly by
the crash.
   Although Cathy was freed within an hour, rescuers had to cut the
mother's body in half to get to Julio. Doctors then had to amputate
the boy's right leg below the knee to free him from pieces of
concrete.
   Betts, a trauma surgeon from Oakland Children's Hospital,
performed the surgery at the scene on the night of the quake,
working in a tight crawl space between the layers of the pancaked
highway.
   After a walking tour of a section of the collapsed expressway,
Bush went into a trailor to meet Betts and a medical associate and
to call the boy's father.
   ``How are things going?'' he said to the boy's father. ``I'm
proud of your courage, proud of the doctors. You be strong. Have
your faith.''
   The boy is in critical condition at a local hospital; his sister
is in fair condition.
   ``There 1,000 of these kinds of incidents, I'm sure, that I'm
not even aware of,'' Bush said later.

   British Airways PLC on Friday bailed out of a
group trying to buy UAL Corp., a defection that sent UAL stock into
another tailspin and dealt the buyout plan its second stunning blow
in a week.
   The pilots union at UAL's United Airlines, which along with
management is leading the buyout attempt, quickly announced it was
developing a new plan that would include for the first time
United's flight attendants as partners.
   But some analysts and United's Machinists union, which has
opposed the buyout plan, said British Airway's departure may doom
the proposal.
   In a brief statement Friday in London, British Airways said it
``does not intend to participate in any new deal for the
acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future.'' It didn't give
reasons, but said its marketing agreement with United would remain
in effect.
   ``We're obviously disappointed. However, we do plan to move
ahead with our new partners, the flight attendants, who joined with
us yesterday,'' said Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the United
chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association. ALPA represents 7,000
of United's 70,000 workers.
   The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 14,000
workers at United, issued a statement saying it would participate
with ALPA and UAL management in discussions about any new proposal.
   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for Chicago-based UAL, said the company
had no comment on British Airways' withdrawal.
   The original pilot-management buyout proposal approved by UAL's
board of directors called for UAL workers to own 75 percent of the
company, management 10 percent and British Airways 15 percent.
   It would have been the largest employee-led buyout of a U.S.
company.
   British Airways' announcement came one week after the
pilot-management group said it had failed to secure financing for
its original $6.75 billion, $300-a-share offer, contributing to a
Friday the 13th selloff on Wall Street that resurrected fears of
the 1987 stock market crash.
   While the stock market overall has rebounded since last week,
UAL shares have continued spiraling lower, reflecting growing
pessimism among investors that any debt-financed takeover proposal
of the airline will succeed.
   UAL tumbled $21.62{ to finish at $168.50 a share Friday in New
York Stock Exchange trading, bringing its decline for the week to
about $110.
   Airline analysts in London were pessimistic about the remaining
partners' chances for success.
   ``For the time being, I think it's dead, to be honest,'' said
Nick Cunningham, of the investment firm Laing and Cruickshank.
   A spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers at United agreed.
   ``It was not a viable proposal that would have done the
employees any good,'' said spokesman Jim Conley from the Washington
headquarters of the union, which represents 25,000 United workers.
   ``We're hoping that'll be the end of it,'' said Conley, whose
union has maintained the pilot-management proposal would saddle UAL
with a dangerous debt load.
   But airline analyst Stephen Dexter, of Kemper Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago, said British Airways may not necessarily have
pulled out for good.
   He said British Airways, which prides itself on being a
first-class carrier, is unaccustomed to the indignity of whipsawing
takeover efforts.
   But ``they have invested very, very heavily in their
relationship with United,'' Dexter said.

   A protest by conscientious objectors
outside the federal Parliament building Friday led to a brief fight
between protesters and bodyguards for West Berlin Mayor Walter
Momper.
   The anti-military service group called ``Action for Total
Refusal'' was protesting federal efforts to force a convicted draft
dodger to serve jail time in West Germany.
   Federal officials are trying to extradite Gerhard Scherer from
West Berlin to begin serving a five-month sentence for refusing
both mandatory military service and the alternative Civilian
Service option for those opposed to violence.
   About 10 demonstrators, protesting illegally on the Parliament
grounds, startled Momper's security detachment when they unfurled a
banner that had been hidden in a bouquet of flowers the protesters
tried to press on Momper.
   One of the protesters wore a rubber mask of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl on the back of his head and had his coat on backwards as well,
creating the impression he had his back to Momper when he leaped
forward to unfurl the banner.
   Security men quickled wrestled the masked protester to the
ground, and others engaged in brief battles with demonstrators to
separate them from Momper's party.
   Momper, a member of the left-wing Social Democratic Party, had
been asked by the anti-military service group to reject the
extradition request. He was at the federal Parliament building on
Friday to be inaugurated as president of the Bundesrat, the upper
house of Parliament.
   Demonstrations are forbidden on the West German Parliament
grounds, but no arrests were made following the incident Friday.
   West German residents of West Berlin are not subject to the
compulsory service law because of the city's status under Allied
control.
   But Scherer was a resident of Baden-Wuerttemberg state when he
reached the military service age. He is in hiding in West Berlin,
where authorities have been asked to find him and return him to
Baden-Wuerttemberg to serve his term.

   Fifty-four deaths have been confirmed, with the toll expected to
grow as more bodies are pulled out of the wreckage where I-880
collapsed. Officials said Friday that 33 bodies had been pulled
from the I-880 rubble, with dozens of missing people expected to be
counted among the victims; elsewhere in Northern California, at
least 21 people have been killed.
   The state OES said over 3,000 people were injured in eight
counties of Northern California; a state hospital association said
2,750 were treated but only 250 were hospitalized.

   The earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale, and was centered on the San Andreas Fault 10 miles
northeast of Santa Cruz and 20 miles south of San Jose in the Santa
Cruz Mountains.
   More than 1,500 aftershocks have been recorded, including one of
5.2 that came 40 minutes after the initial quake. A dozen
aftershocks have registered at least 4.0, considered capable of
causing moderate damage.

   President Bush toured the devastated area Friday. He has signed
a disaster relief declaration for seven Bay-area counties and
authorized an initial $273 million. House Speaker Tom Foley said
the House would vote to provide the estimated $2.5 billion needed
in federal aid in a stopgap money bill that comes up on Tuesday.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday it will open
20 assistance centers, including 10 Sunday, to process applications
from victims.

   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said the World Series between
the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants is tentatively
scheduled to resume Tuesday at Candlestick Park, where the quake
hit as Game 3 was about to be played, pending final approval by
Mayor Art Agnos this weekend. Times for the remaining games have
not been announced.
   Both the A's and Giants say few people have asked for refunds,
although ticket brokers say the price for scalped tickets has been
dropping.

   An American Airlines jet with 140 people aboard
landed safely at O'Hare International Airport on Friday after its
pilot shut down one of the Boeing 767's two engines, an airline
spokesman said.
   The pilot of the flight from San Diego to Chicago shut down the
jet's right engine 15 miles from the airport, said American
Airlines spokesman Tom Stack.
   The plane had 132 passengers aboard and a crew of eight, Stack
said.
   A fire crew was on standby in case of emergency, but the
wide-body plane landed safely and there were no injuries, Stack
said.
   Stack said he did not immediately know why the pilot shut down
the engine, but said American officials were investigating.
   Federal Aviation Administration regulations permit the Boeing
767 to fly up to 180 minutes on only one engine, the spokesman said.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded Friday in front of a
hotel in the Caribbean port of Barranquilla, seriously injuring six
people, the city's fire chief said.
   Barranquilla is well known in drug-trafficking circles as the
jumping-off point for much of the Colombian cocaine that is
smuggled into the United States.
   The army headquarters in Barranquilla said in a communique
broadcast by the radio network RCN that five hotel employees and a
guest were injured in the blast. A suspect reportedly was arrested,
RCN said, quoting police sources.
   In other developments, two more mid-level drug trafficking
suspects were arrested and being held for extradition to the United
States, Colombia's federal police said, and judges demanding more
protection from traffickers ended a strike.
   The national radio network Caracol, meanwhile, reported that
authorities took about 2,000 Bogota emerald dealers in for
questioning following last week's slayings of seven dealers in
Quipama, a town 60 miles north of Bogota.
   Authorities arrested several detained dealers and confiscated
some small arms, Caracol said. It said the detentions were intended
to prevent more violence among dealers vying for control of emerald
mines in Boyaca state.
   A Bogota police spokeswoman said she could not confirm the
detentions.
   In the last two months, 22 people have died as a result of
battles for control of the mines.
   The drug suspects were identified by Colombian national police
as Robert James Sokolowski and Nelson Cuevas Ramirez. Both were
arrested Thursday, Sokolowski in Cerrejon and Cuevas Ramirez in
Cartagena, police said.
   The Justice Department in Washington said Sokolowski was
actually Robert Sokol Jr., 29, who is wanted on a 1984 federal
indictment in Greensboro, N.C., on conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   Colombian police said Cuevas Ramirez, 55, is wanted by a New
York federal court on charges of possession of cocaine and
conspiracy to distribute the drug.
   Four drug traffickers already have been extradited to the United
States to face trial. The latest arrest brings to six the number of
Colombians awaiting extradition on drug-related charges in the
United States.
   None of the leaders of Colombia's cocaine cartels however have
been arrested since President Virgilio Barco announced his
crackdown Aug. 18 on traffickers following the assassination of a
leading presidential candidate.
   Although judges ended a three-day strike for protection from
drug barons, they said their demands were not met and they have not
received any of the $19 million in security aid promised by
Washington.
   The judges threatened to strike again if the government does not
provide bulletproof vests, bulletproof cars and bodyguards.
   The government has promised for next week 25 motorcycles for
guards, 72 bulletproof vests and 14 metal detectors, a lawyer with
the union told The Associated Press on Friday.
   On Nov. 30, 50 bulletproof cars will be turned over to judges
who face the most danger from the traffickers, said the lawyer,
Gregorio Oviedo. All of the promised equipment is Colombian, he
said.
   Oviedo said, however, the equipment will cover just 2 percent of
the judges who have received death threats from drug traffickers.
   The only protection given the country's 5,000 judges so far were
40 bulletproof vests delivered as part of a $65 million U.S.
military aid package for fighting traffickers, Oviedo said.
   But the vests weighed 45 pounds and were returned because they
were so heavy and many of the lighter-framed judges were barely
able to walk around with them on, the lawyer said.
   The bomb in Barranquilla, placed in a Renault sedan, broke
almost all the windows in the front of the 16-story Royal Hotel,
fire chief Horacio Blanco told the RCN radio network. Several cars
also were damaged, he said.
   A bomb Sept. 25 in the Hilton Hotel in another Caribbean city,
Cartagena, killed two people.
   As in the Cartagena bombing, no one claimed responsibility for
the Barranquilla explosion.
   Since the crackdown began, 165 bomb blasts have killed 16 people
and injured 201.
   The federal and municipal judges and 12,000 other court workers
went on strike Tuesday, hours after a federal judge was murdered in
Medellin.
   Drug traffickers claimed responsibility and said the judge was
killed in retaliation for the extradition to the United States of
drug trafficking suspects.
   In the last 12 years, 221 Colombian court workers, including 42
judges, have been killed, many by traffickers.
   The daily El Tiempo reported Friday that a lawyer representing
the Medellin cocaine cartel contacted the country's leading leftist
presidential candidate two weeks ago.
   The candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic Union
party, and the lawyer met at Jaramillo's house, El Tiempo said. The
lawyer, who was not identified, made a plea for contacts between
Jaramillo's party and the traffickers, the daily quoted Jaramillo
as saying.
   Former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen said Thursday the
United States should give $500 million a year to Colombia to fight
drug traffickers, noting Washington spends millions ``to stop the
advance of communism'' in El Salvador and Nicaragua.

   An FBI agent received a minor stab wound
Friday when a homeless man apparently attacked him at random,
police said.
   Chris Warrener was attacked after his wife, Gayla, who also is
an FBI agent, was bumped by a man as she was returning to her car
after lunch with her husband in downtown Washignton.
   Mrs. Warrener called to her husband for help after being bumped
by the man, a scuffle followed, and Warrener was stabbed in the
chest, said Allen Harper, spokesman for the D.C. Police Department.
   Warrener was treated and released for the wound at George
Washington University Hospital.
   The man, whom authorities believed to be homeless, was
identified as Willis Singleton Jr. He was charged with simple
assault and assault with a dangerous weapon and was to be arraigned
in Superior Court Saturday, Harper said.

<HEAD>Mine Officials Believe Torch Sparked Explosion, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATCROFT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of a coal mine where 10 men
died in an explosion last month believe an acetylene torch sparked
the blast, a newspaper reported Friday.
   Federal and state investigators have not determined what ignited
methane gas that exploded Sept. 13 in the western Kentucky mine,
but The Evansville (Ind.) Press said a cutting torch is Pyro Mining
Co.'s official theory.
   Investigators recovered two cutting torches from the mine soon
after the explosion.
   Maurice Childers, chief investigator for the U.S. Mine Safety
and Health Administration, said Oct. 3 that the valves on the
torches were closed, but did not rule them out as a possible source
of ignition.
   The Press said Pyro officials have told about 25 workers about
the company's theory. The newspaper said two of those workers
talked to the Press on condition of anonymity.
   ``They're leaning toward the torches,'' the newspaper quoted one
of the Pyro employees as saying. ``They believe there might have
been a small pocket of (methane) gas (to) ignite, and it carried
into a bigger pocket of gas that exploded.''
   Charles Schulties, president of Pyro parent Costain Coal Co.,
and Costain Vice President Jim Greenlee said Wednesday they have
reached a conclusion about what caused the explosion but would not
discuss it publicly until all mine employees were notified.
   Greenlee would neither confirm nor deny the cutting-torch
theory, The Press said. Costain officials did not return telephone
calls Friday from The Associated Press.
   Officials of the federal mine safety agency have theorized that
shortly before the explosion, company workers removed a cinderblock
partition which helps direct air within the mine. That could have
pushed a pocket of methane gas into the area where the victims were
working, causing in an explosion, the agency has said.
   Costain officials have said they believe the barrier was removed
after the explosion and that it could not have been a factor even
if it had been removed before the accident.
   The William Station mine has been closed since the blast, but
MSHA will allow it to reopen as soon as three ventilation problems
are corrected, a spokesman said Friday. The problems are among some
280 citations the government has issued since the explosion.
   All but 14 of the citations have been taken care of, and none
appears related to the cause of the accident, Joey Lucas, a
spokesman for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, said in
Arlington, Va.

   The space shuttle's astronauts were
told to conserve power Friday for a possible one- or two-day
extension of their mission due to the threat of high winds at
Atlantis' California landing site Monday.
   Mission Control directed shuttle commander Don Williams to shut
down a high-power heater on a cooling system. Williams suggested
also turning off one of three computer displays on the flight deck.
   Mission control commentator Brian Welch said NASA was trying to
trim about 600 watts of power usage to enable the shuttle to stay
in orbit longer. Without conservation, Atlantis has enough fuel,
oxygen, power and other supplies to remain aloft two days beyond
the planned five-day mission, Welch said.
   Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base in
California's Mojave Desert at 3:38 p.m. EDT.
   The possibility of a longer mission arose when a weather front
moved across the shuttle landing site. High winds following the
front could be a problem for Atlantis on Monday, forecasters said.
   Flight Director Ron Dittemore told reporters that forecasters
hope the winds will be calm by Monday, or at least calm enough to
permit landing one orbit early _ about 90 minutes before originally
scheduled _ when afternoon gusts would be less severe.
   If a Monday landing is impossible at Edwards, Dittemore said,
Atlantis would be kept in orbit at least an extra day.
   Should the winds persist for a couple days, controllers would
consider an alternate landing site, he said. The Northrup Strip at
White Sands Missile Range, N.M., would be the first choice and the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida would be second.
   The astronauts spent part of the third day of their
experiment-filled space flight demonstrating simple medical
procedures that can be done aboard the shuttle.
   In the medical demonstration, astronaut Shannon Lucid, playing
``patient,'' floated upside down while Ellen Baker, a physician,
took her temperature and examined her throat and ears. The session
was taped earlier in the day by the astronauts and later aired on
NASA satellite television.
   The shuttle's first-aid kit ``carries pretty much what any
doctor's black bag would carry,'' Ms. Baker said. It includes a
stethoscope, bandages, adhesive, aspirin and other common
medications.
   The astronauts also photographed the beauties and blemishes of
Earth for a documentary film.
   ``We just got some great shots of Central America, right over
the border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica; the city of San Jose
was completely clear,'' said astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz, who was
born in San Jose, Costa Rica, and who has been a hero in that
country since his first space shuttle mission in 1986.
   He plans on Saturday to speak from orbit with Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias.
   But the 70mm motion pictures aren't for home movies. The crews
of several shuttle flights have been snapping thousands of feet of
film of Earth's features for a documentary called ``Exploring the
Blue Planet.''
   The large-screen film, which will debut next September at the
National Air and Space Museum in Washington, not only will show the
grandeur of the planet but also will exhibit how it is being
environmentally damaged by both man and nature.
   The IMAX Corp., which is producing the film, said it wants to
show how such things as pollution dumps into waterways,
deforestation of rain forests, storms and other phenomena have an
impact on the globe.
   The astronauts were instructed by the ground Friday to
photograph a dust storm over the African nation of Chad and
volcanoes in Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and Guatemala.
   ``We also got some good shots of the Straits of Magellan and the
Mediterranean,'' Chang-Diaz said. Other targets Friday included
Cuba and the islands of the Caribbean, the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
northwest Africa and Australia.
   The astronauts also beamed to Mission Control brilliant
television pictures of the aurora australis, or southern lights, a
luminous show created by solar radiation interacting with the
Earth's magnetic field near the South Pole.
   ``Spectacular,'' commented Chang-Diaz.
   The fifth crew member is pilot Mike McCulley.
   As the astronauts worked through a heavy schedule of medical and
science experiments, the nuclear-powered Galileo probe they
deployed about six hours after blastoff Wednesday was hurtling
across the solar system at 9,000 mph relative to the Earth and was
in ``perfect shape,'' officials reported.
   The $1.5 billion probe's course for its six-year, 2.4
billion-mile trip to Jupiter had covered nearly 500,000 miles
Friday. Once it reaches Jupiter, Galileo is to orbit the planet and
give the best look yet of another planet and find clues to the
universe's origin.
   ``The flight team is quite exulted. ... The overall assessment
is that the Galileo spacecraft is in really fine shape,'' said NASA
spokesman Charles Redmond.
   He said that on Saturday, Galileo's computer memory could be
disrupted by radiation from a solar flare that erupted on the sun
Thursday. If so, the computer should correct itself as it is
designed to do. If not, the ground will do it.
   The radiation dose should be greater than the spacecraft will
encounter at Jupiter, Redmond said, and thus will be a good test of
the vehicle. ``This will give Galileo the smart robot a chance to
prove how smart it is,'' he said.
   ``We've got a full day planned for you,'' Mission Control told
the astronauts, and even before they had breakfast, they were asked
to take pictures of the Straits of Gibraltar for the IMAX film.
   The wakeup songs were from colleges attended by the three
mission specialists on board, ``Boomer Sooners,'' ``UConn Huskies''
and ``Victory March.''
   Lucid attended the University of Oklahoma, Chang-Diaz the
University of Connecticut and Baker the State University of New
York at Buffalo.
   The crew continued experiments that measure Earth's damaged
ozone layer and study the effects of weightlessness on the human
body, the processing of polymers and the growth of corn and ice
crystals.

   A policewoman shot her two young sons to
death with her service revolver, then killed herself just as
another officer was arriving on the scene, authorities said.
   Jacqueline McMillen, a 27-year-old patrol officer for the state
Department of Public Service, shot her 3-year-old and 8-month-old
sons and then herself, Yavapai County sheriff's Capt. Bill Murphy
said.
   A DPS officer was just arriving, and had called for back-up,
said DPS spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt.
   Ms. McMillen, who lives in nearby Cordes Junction, brought her
children here early Friday to her estranged husband's residence
about 10 miles east of Prescott and crawled into the house after
breaking a window, Murphy said.
   Ms. McMillen then made a series of phone calls to friends and
relatives, Schmidt said. DPS officials were notified and dispatched
an officer.
   Her husband, Dennis McMillen, a 35-year-old investigative
officer in Prescott for the DPS, was in California, Schmidt said.
   The McMillens were separated and were in the process of getting
a divorce, Schmidt said.
   Jacqueline McMillen's co-workers had seen nothing to indicate
she would act violently, Schmidt said.
   ``We'll probably never know why she would do something like
this,'' said Schmidt.

   A hospital isn't normally the ideal spot for
celebrating a second birthday, but Nancy Lopez and her son,
Joaquin, did just that Friday because she credits two liver
transplants for saving her son's life.
   ``I'm very, very happy. I think my son's life, and my life, were
saved by the operations,'' Mrs. Lopez, no relation to the
professional golfer of the same name, said at Children's Hospital
Medical Center. ``I tell you, if he wasn't alive, I wouldn't be
either, because you go through so much in something like this.''
   Joaquin was found in the first month of his life to have a
potentially fatal disease called biliary atresia, characterized by
the absence or degeneration of the liver's bile ducts and failure
of the liver.
   Surgeons at Children's Hospital performed two operations on
Joaquin in November 1988, surgically paring down larger livers to
place in his body. The first liver was rejected.
   Doctors transplanted the second liver, then removed Joaquin's
spleen a day later to prevent his body from rejecting the organ.
   Doctors and Mrs. Lopez said Friday they are pleased with the
boy's progress, even though he suffered from the flu. He will
remain on medication for life that helps keep his body from
rejecting the transplanted liver.
   Today, he is an active, normal child, his mother said. He
returns to the Cincinnati hospital for a progress checkup every
four to six weeks.
   ``He's doing great,'' Mrs. Lopez said. ``Transplantation is
making a big difference.''
   Mrs. Lopez, her husband, Joaquin, and their daughter, Beatriz,
5, moved from their native Puerto Rico to the Dayton suburb of
Centerville last year in order to be closer to the Cincinnati
hospital. They previously had been forced to make repeated trips
from Puerto Rico to Cincinnati since the boy's October 1987 birth.
   The family plans also to celebrate the son's birthday at their
home this weekend. Mrs. Lopez said relatives are flying in from
Puerto Rico for the party.

<HEAD>Quake-Hit SF Bay Area Commuters Hunt New Ways To Work</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like storm-tossed captains plotting a
course around rocks and shoals, a million San Francisco Bay area
workers _ their normal commute routes ruined by an earthquake _ are
devising new strategies for getting to and from work.
   ``I really don't see how there cannot be gridlock on Monday,''
said a harried Tom Silvey, a state Franchise Tax Board worker now
assigned to the state Office of Emergency Services.
   Monday is considered the region's transportation equivalent of
D-day along 70 miles from San Francisco to Santa Cruz. It includes
a plan for using Navy landing craft to ferry commuters between
Oakland and San Francisco, where four freeways and high-speed
connectors are closed.
   For much of the work force, commute times are expected to
stretch into an extra hour or more each way.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit, the railroad that travels under San
Francisco Bay to connect the city with East Bay communities, is
running extra cars and expanding to 24-hour operation. Daily BART
business is expected to double to at least 300,000 person-trips.
   Morning comute tolls have been eliminated on all transbay
bridges except the Golden Gate, where commuters will be excused
from tolls on Friday mornings only.
   By far the most serious disruption is to the traffic _ 243,000
vehicles each working day _ normally carried by the key
eight-mile-long San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. It a major San
Francisco lifeline for food, industrial and other goods, vehicular
traffic from the east, and some half-million people a day.
   Tuesday's quake dumped a 50-foot section of the bridge's top
deck onto the bottom deck of the 52-year-old span, and engineers
estimated repairs might take as long as two months.
   A driver who normally takes the Bay Bridge from San Francisco to
Oakland must now either go 20 miles south and then cross the bay on
the San Mateo Bridge, or take the Golden Gate Bridge and drive 18
miles north in Marin County to cross the bay on the Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge. The southern route costs an extra 60 miles, the
northern detour an additional 40 miles.
   In Oakland, the upper deck of a 1\-mile portion of Interstate
880 collapsed onto the lower deck in a deadly vise of concrete and
steel. The roadway, a conduit to and from the Bay Bridge, East
Oakland, bay-side cities and points south, will be out of
commission for at least two years.
   In Santa Cruz, 70 miles south of San Francisco, the 20,000
people who cross the Santa Cruz Mountains daily on State Highway 17
to work in Silicon Valley must seek alternate routes because
landslides have closed that route.
   The recommended alternates from San Jose to Santa Cruz: South on
101 to Highway 152 west, then north to Highway 1 _ 40 miles extra;
or, west from San Jose on Highway 9 _ 20 miles extra.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. announced Friday it had suspended bus
service to Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Los Gatos, Cupertino and
Saratoga because of the closure of Highway 17.
   In San Francisco, central-city motorists used to zipping down
the hills to the Gough and Oak street connectors to Highway 101
found the on-ramps closed because of structural damage to roadway
underpinnings. They must now travel city streets for a mile or so
to find southbound on-ramps.
   In addition, the city's Embarcadero Freeway, which runs on the
edge of the bay, is closed because of structural failure. And the
I-280 extension from downtown San Francisco to 101 near Candlestick
Park sustained structural failure and will be closed for several
months.
   Those are the only two other double-deck freeways in Northern
California besides I-880.

   Winning a court judgment doesn't mean you'll get
your money, because in real life things aren't necessarily as easy
as they appear on the television show ``The People's Court,'' judge
said.
   The show's popularity has made the public more aware of
small-claims court, but also has contributed to some unfortunate
misconceptions, judges said recently.
   In some metropolitan counties, the number of small claims has
more than tripled during the 1980s.
   However, the legal process is not as simple as Judge Joseph
Wapner, the black-robed hero of the TV show, sometimes makes it
look.
   Although the show may be bogging down his court with claims,
Cobb County Chief Magistrate James G. Bodiford said it's providing
him with better informed litigants.
   ``The public is getting much more intelligent about small
claims, and `The People's Court' has helped,'' he said.
   Except in collection of judgments.
   On TV, Wapner tells the winner how much money he'll collect, and
the show's producers pay him.
   Not so in real life, where the individual must collect the
judgment, sometimes by again going to court to get wages garnisheed.
   ``I remember one lady who walked up to me and said, `Judge,
which office do I go to to collect my money?''' Bodiford recalled.
``I said, `Ma'am, you have to collect the money.' She was just
incensed.''
   The National Center for State Courts says the small-claims
caseload has nearly doubled this decade. Wapner, who was in Atlanta
last summer to film a week's worth of shows with local litigants,
acknowledged that his program has influenced Americans to flock to
small-claims court in record numbers.
   ``But before our show, people didn't know that there was a
small-claims court that they can go to, and now they do,'' Wapner,
69, said from his California office. ``Now they can go to court and
have their dispute settled by a judge and not through fisticuffs.''
   In suburban Gwinnett County, Chief Magistrate Warren Davis is
getting tired of hearing about Wapner. So, he now issues a standard
warning at the start of each session in his small-claims court:
``Television is not real life.''
   ``I can't tell you how many times I've been quoted Judge Wapner
in court,'' Davis said.

   Police officers investigating reports
that a teacher had sex with a 17-year-old student interrupted a
school staff meeting, thumbing through hundreds of files and even
examining trash.
   The search Oct. 3 at school district headquarters, and another
one three days later at Bartlett High School, prompted the
Anchorage School District to sue the police and touched off a furor
over privacy rights, police use of search warrants and the
responsibility of school officials to deal with allegations of
misconduct among staff members.
   Heightening interest in the dispute is the fact that onetime
English and journalism teacher Gordon ``Satch'' Carlson, who
resigned in August after school officials confronted him with the
allegations of misconduct, was also a columnist for the Anchorage
Daily News.
   The 44-year-old Carlson, who won a national Ernest Hemingway
parody contest in 1988, quit writing the column, which commented
humorously on local politics and other topics, in late August. The
newspaper didn't say why he left.
   Carlson has said only that he committed no crime and that ``some
of the personalities involved are in hot pursuit simply because of
who I am.''
   ``There have been no charges filed, and I don't know if charges
will be filed,'' said Jeff Feldman, an attorney for Carlson.
   ``I'm not aware that there have been any allegations made that
constitute violations of Alaska law.''
   The dispute surrounding Carlson did not become public until Oct.
3, when police, led by Chief Kevin O'Leary, interrupted a meeting
at school district headquarters and searched through files and
garbage for evidence of sexual misconduct. With another warrant,
officers entered Bartlett High School on Oct. 6 to look for samples
of semen and hair in a music room.
   School administrators say the wide-ranging search violated the
privacy of personnel, students and parents, and went beyond what
was authorized by the court. An angry Superintendent William Coats
said officers could have gotten the information they wanted simply
by asking.
   The girl at the center of the investigation _ court transcripts
made public this week suggest a second may have been involved _ was
older than 16, the age of consent in Alaska. But a separate state
law cited in the search warrants bans sexual contact between adults
in a position of trust and children under the age of 18. The law,
however, doesn't specify whether teaching is such a position of
trust.
   For the public, questions about Carlson's activities appear to
have been outdistanced by questions of school district and police
ethics.
   School officials acknowledge that they first heard of the
allegations last May, when a student claimed that another student
had an affair with Carlson. Both he and the girl denied it, school
officials say, and the matter was not pursued until the girl's
family repeated the allegation this summer and Carlson was
confronted and resigned.
   School district spokesman Michael Malone said appropriate
reports were filed through the state youth services agency. The
agency contacted police after learning of the allegations from the
school district in September.
   But prosecutors suggest school officials were slow to report the
allegations, and should not have tried to deal with them internally
instead of going to the police early on.
   The school's former principal and the acting principal, in
affidavits this week, denied that they were pressured by school
officials not to report the allegations. They said a police
investigators mispresented their statements during a hearing for
search warrants.
   In a letter to the editor of both local newspapers, Oren Bell
argued that the school district ``is a well-oiled machine when it
comes to protecting its employees even to the detriment of our
students. I have no doubt whatsoever that the (police department)
could not have gotten the evidence it sought by asking for it.''
   Another school district critic, Charley Schneider, said in a
letter that the district was ``wasting our money'' suing the
police, adding, ``This appears to me to be an attempt to discredit
what may come to light.''
   But to Jim C. Walton, the school raid suggests a pathway for
``such action on any of our homes or businesses.''
   ``If we do not protest this, we are essentially allowing the
development of a police state,'' he said in a letter to the
Anchorage Daily News.
   The schools' suit assailing the actions of prosecutors and
police may be just the the first legal maneuver in the Carlson case.
   ``We are opposed to the search and we are exploring every legal
option,'' said Jamie Bollenbach, executive director of the Alaska
Civil Liberties Union.
   The Alaska office of the National Education Association, which
once counted Carlson among its members, is prepared to join the
ACLU in legal action, President Don Oberg said.
   Meanwhile, the district attorney's office and the police are
saying little.
   Assistant District Attorney Stephen Branchflower on Tuesday
declined to comment on the case. Deputy Police Chief Dwayne Udland
would say only that police stand by their actions.
   ``Of course we believe we did the right thing,'' Udland said.

   Wick Communications on Friday
announced it will purchase the Douglas Daily Dispatch from Western
Newspapers effective Nov. 1.
   Neither Sierra Vista-based Wick Communications nor Yuma-based
Western Newspapers disclosed the purchase price.
   Wick Communications, owned by brothers Walter and Robert Wick,
already owns 25 daily and weekly newspapers, including the other
two daily newspapers in southeastern Arizona's Cochise County: the
Sierra Vista Herald and the Bisbee Daily Review. Each publishes six
days a week. The Dispatch publishes five days a week.
   The Wicks said Greg LaFreniere would be the Dispatch's new
publisher. LaFreniere, 48, is the publisher of Wick Communication
weeklies in the Cochise County communities of Willcox and Benson.
He will continue as publisher of those two newspapers in addition
to his new duties.
   Western Newspapers purchased the Dispatch in March 1985 from
Thomson Newspapers.
   Don Soldwedel, Western Newspapers chairman, said the Dispatch's
current publisher, Robin Richards, will be transferred to another
Western Newspapers property.
   Western owns daily and weekly newspapers, a commercial printing
company and an outdoor advertising company, with operations in
Arizona, California and Nevada.

<HEAD>Premier Ozal Fails in Bid to Win First Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal, running for president
in defiance of growing protests, failed to receive the necessary
majority for election Friday in a first ballot held at a parliament
session boycotted by the opposition.
   Ozal received 247 votes from the 285 deputies of his Motherland
Party in the 450-member parliament.
   This would be enough to put him over on a third ballot Oct. 31,
when a simple majority is sufficient but it fell short of the
two-thirds majority of 300 required in the first two ballots.
   Fethi Celikbas, a Motherland deputy who is the only candidate
running against Ozal, garnered 18 votes, and the rest cast empty
ballots.
   Ozal criticized the opposition boycott, saying it went against
their constitutional duty. ``They should have named their own
candidate and participated in the election,'' he told a news
conference after the balloting.
   He said he planned to designate a new premier from his party
within days after he takes over as president Nov. 9. That is when
the seven-year term of President Kenan Evren expires.
   Four Motherland deputies have resigned from the party to protest
Ozal's decision to run for president.
   Tinaz Titiz, a former tourism minister in the Ozal government,
said in his resignation statement Friday that he could not condone
an election carried out without the participation of the opposition.
   Also empty were the seats reserved in the galleries for outgoing
President Evren, leader of the 1980 military coup, and top military
officials.
   The military, always a power behind presidential elections, has
made clear it will stay out this time.
   Opposition parties and newspaper commentators claim Ozal lacks a
popular mandate since the Motherland Party suffered a major defeat
in local elections in March. The party came in third after the
Social Democrats and the centrist True Path Party of former Premier
Suleyman Demirel, winning 21.75 percent of the votes.
   They also say Ozal, the first premier attempting to ascend to
the presidency in Turkey, cannot be the nonpartisan head of state
required by the constitution.
   Erdal Inonu, leader of the Social Democrats, said they would
consider resigning from the parliament en masse if this could stop
Ozal.
   If elected, Ozal will be Turkey's eight president and the second
who is not a former military man.
   Ozal was elected premier six years ago when his newly founded
Motherland Party won the 1983 elections that restored civilian rule.

   A weekend of rain loomed as a
threat in the mountains north of Santa Cruz where 60 houses, some
of them the dream homes of Silicon Valley commuters, have tumbled
off stilts or foundations in this hillside town and a score of
others suffered severe damage.
   On Friday, a team of geologists advised occupants of 100 other
houses that they could safely return. Fears of massive landslides
had earlier prompted official urgings to evacuate, although many
residents brushed them off.
   ``It's a dangerous area, but all my stuff is here. My dogs are
here. I figured you go down with the ship. Where do you go?'' said
Todd Viele, 27.
   The geologists determined that a jagged fissure which streaked
through yards had caused only six of the 60 ruined houses near the
top of Blue Ridge Road to tumble; the bedrock did not split, they
said. The other damaged houses were shaken off their foundations by
ground motion.
   Residents of more than 100 houses at the bottom of the road were
told Friday evening the fissure seemed unlikely to cause the
landslides that only hours before had seemed to threaten to sweep
them away.
   ``They are calling it a slight fissure where the ground opened
and shifted in a localized area,'' said Stan Robustelli, assistant
chief of the Boulder Creek fire district. ``They are not concerned
about the mountain coming down at this point.''
   The 6,800 people around Boulder Creek appear to be among the
hardest hit by the earthquake and among the least willing to leave
their homes, many of them built of redwood and glass and carrying
pricetags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In recent years,
the town was transformed from a mountain enclave of summer homes to
a year-round community, with many residents working in the nearby
technology corridor called Silicon Valley.
   As experts made the rounds inspecting structures Friday, they
counted 82 houses that suffered moderate structural damage to total
loss, including the 60 at the top of the road.
   ``When you start to figure percentages of people and percentages
of homes in the area compared to San Francisco, we have a greater
percentage loss here, except for loss of life,'' said Fire Chief
Bud Tomlin. ``We were very fortunate. We didn't have any deaths or
serious injuries.''
   With rain starting early Saturday morning and expected to last
through the weekend, jittery residents remained concerned about the
uncertain earth beneath their feet.
   State transit crews patched deep cracks in roads to try to
prevent rain from washing away more soil and houses.
   The 100 houses at the lower end of narrow, twisting Blue Ridge
Road were at the greatest risk because of deep cracks several
inches wide in the pavement. About 60 homes at the upper end of the
road have already shifted up to 4 feet off their foundations or
have fallen off stilts that propped them on the mountainside.
   Suzanne Bellairs, whose home is built on a concrete slab,
nevertheless was staying at a friend's trailer that officials
considered out of danger of landslides. But she was contemplating
going home, where officials warned it might not be safe.
   ``There isn't any doubt in my mind that if the mountain comes
down, we'll lose our home,'' said Bottoms.
   ``I feel safer out of it, but it's more stressful being gone,''
she said. ``We're staying in a 25-foot trailer with four adults and
four kids. It would be better to be stressed at home.''

   The top U.S. Customs official in this
border city was arrested Friday on felony charges he smuggled
liquor, clothing, saddles and food into the United States,
officials said.
   Fernando Macias, who directs Customs operations at two
international bridges and the Port of Brownsville, was arrested
Friday morning by agents from the agency's internal affairs
division, said Customs spokeswoman Judy Turner.
   Macias pleaded innocent before U.S. Magistrate Fidencia G. Garza
to eight charges accusing him of illegally bringing items into the
United States and a ninth count of failing to pay duty on the
liquor. He was released on a $200,000 personal recognizance bond.
   If convicted of all the charges, Macias faces up to 43 years in
prison and $2,250,000 in fines, according to Assistant U.S.
Attorney Mervin Mosbacker.
   Mosbacker refused to discuss details of the investigation that
led to Macias' indictment and arrest.
   Macias said he was innocent. ``I've been in Brownsville for nine
and a half years, I've always tried to present a positive image,''
he said. ``I've been in the (Customs) service for 20 years; I'm not
going to throw it away.''
   The indictment accuses Macias of importing merchandise from
Mexico last Dec. 7 without paying taxes, duty, bond or having it
inspected. The merchandise included saddles, food, clothing and
several bottles of liquor, the indictment said.

   Indiana farmers brushed snow off the pumpkins Friday, salt
trucks made the rounds in Chicago, and Ohio utility crews cleared
branches and repaired power lines downed in a freak storm a day
earlier.
   The storm dumped more than 8 inches of snow in north-central
Indiana by Friday morning and 2 to 6 inches over much of Illinois,
Ohio, southern Michigan and southeast Wisconsin.
   Farther south, cities in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Missouri
logged record lows and officials there fretted over finding
shelters for the homeless.
   The snow was a mixed blessing for Indiana farmers, whose crops
had been damaged by previous frosts.
   ``It has pretty much stopped harvest,'' said Greensburg farmer
Jeff Smiley. However, a Purdue University pathologist said the cold
weather will suppress the growth of damaging molds.
   A tourist official for the Brown County Convention and Visitors
Bureau in southern Indiana bemoaned the snow's abrupt intrusion on
the foliage display that annually attracts thousands of
leaf-peepers to the area 40 miles south of Indianapolis.
   ``We just had a travel writer come in from Iowa, and he was
disappointed there was no sunshine,'' said Mary Fredericksen, sales
manager for the convention bureau.
   The winter preview appeared likely to leave as fast as it came.
Highs in the mid-50s to low 70s were forecast for Saturday and
Sunday for most of the Midwest.
   About 10,000 Cincinnati-area utility customers were still
without power Friday afternoon. Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Co.
spokesman Bruce Stoecklin said about 350 workers were on the job,
including tree-trimming contractors who were removing fallen limbs
from power lines.
   Power was restored Friday to about 14,000 electricity customers
in Dayton.
   About 17,000 people were without power in southern Michigan,
mostly in the Detroit area. Four to 6 inches of snow was reported
in Gaylord, in the northern Lower Peninsula.
   Twenty trucks were out salting Chicago roadways, said Kirstin
Svare, a spokeswoman for the city's Streets and Sanitation
department, but warmth from Lake Michigan kept the sleet from
turning to snow.
   A freeze warning was in effect Friday night for all of northern
Florida, with temperatures across the region expected to drop
overnight into the upper 20s to lower 30s.
   Plants that normally withstand cold temperatures may be damaged
because the cold spell comes right after unseasonably warm weather,
said Charles Guy, a plant physiologist for the Institute for Food
and Agricultural Sciences in Gainesville.
   But frost is expected to extend only to Marion County, near
Gainesville, causing little impact on the citrus industry farther
south, he said.
   Miami Beach broke a 34-year-old record low with a 58-degree
reading. West Palm Beach managed to set two records within 18
hours, a high of 92 Thursday and a low of 56 Friday. Tallahassee
bottomed out at 34, Pensacola chilled to 35, Apalachicola
registered 42, Daytona Beach 44, and Orlando 46 _ all records for
the day.
   An overnight freeze warning also was in effect for all of
Georgia.
   The early cold weather sparked concern for shelter for the
estimated 100,000 homeless in the Atlanta area. Shelters normally
do not open until Nov. 1, but emergency overflow shelters were
opened Thursday.
   ``In the next couple of days we really have no provisions. Our
shelters are packed and have been all summer,'' said Lynn
Brockwell-Carey, housing manager at Cobb County Emergency Aid,
northwest of Atlanta.

   Senate concern about freedom of speech and a
cooling of the summer's political passions combined to defeat the
proposed constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, lawmakers
say.
   ``I don't know that public interest has faded; I think that
public interest has changed,'' Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said
Thursday after the proposed amendment failed in the Senate.
   Opponents of the measure said Americans are having second
thoughts about the notion of changing the Constitution.
   White House lobbying appeared minimal despite a strong public
campaign that last summer took President Bush to the foot of the
Iwo Jima Memorial.

   Pravda told its readers today that a confidant of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is replacing its conservative editor, who had
resisted letting the Communist Party daily fully embrace the new
openness sweeping the Soviet press.
   In a front-page report, Pravda said Viktor G. Afanasyev had
resigned and been replaced by Ivan T. Frolov, an advisor to
Gorbachev for the last year and a former editor of the party's
theoretical monthly journal Kommunist.
   The move appears to assure that the voice of the Communist Party
will now reflect more clearly the views of Gorbachev and his
reform-minded allies.
   Pravda is the country's most authoritative newspaper, but its
circulation has lagged under Gorbachev as readers turn to livelier
more informative newspapers. Its editor sits in on closed meetings
of the ruling Politburo.

   After decades of soaring rates of skin cancer _
largely because of suntanning _ Americans finally may be wising up
to the dangers of the bronzed look, a medical researcher says.
   Rates of malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin
cancer, appeared to start leveling off in 1988, after 27 years of
steep rises, said Dr. Andrew Glass of Kaiser Permanente's Center
for Health Research in Portland, Ore.
   ``It's going to take some more time to follow that along,''
Glass said in a telephone interview Thursday. But early figures
from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., appear to
indicate a similar leveling off, he said.
   Glass' remarks came after he reported on a long-term tracking of
300,000 members of the Kaiser Permanente prepaid health plan in the
Portland, Ore., and Vancouver, Wash., areas.

   U.S. military personnel in South Korea buy six
times as much Chivas Regal scotch as the much larger U.S. force in
Europe _ but instead of drinking it, they're selling it on the
Korean black market, a study says.
   SPAM, Aqua Net hair spray and rice are among other favorites
selling in huge quantities at U.S. military commissaries in South
Korea, apparently bound for the black market, the General
Accounting Office said Thursday.
   Such sales far exceed what would normally be consumed by the
70,000 authorized buyers stationed there, and U.S. taxpayers are
footing part of the bill, GAO witnesses said at a Senate hearing.
The GAO is Congress' investigative arm.
   The Defense Department exports duty-free goods to bases in Korea
and other countries for sale at cut-rate prices in the commissaries
and exchanges.

   The lowly spud never had it so good.
   A bunch of potatoes from Idaho, California, Washington state,
Michigan and faraway Chile was gussied up and served at a gourmet,
seven-course luncheon Thursday by the Watergate's renowned French
chef, Jean-Louis Palladin.
   They were shredded, diced, pureed, baked, fried, simmered,
glazed and dunked in rich cream sauces by Jean-Louis and his staff.
Then they were escorted out of the kitchen by tuxedo-clad waiters
under the bright glare of camera lights, to the oohs and aahs of a
half-dozen diners.
   The all-potato menu was prepared for the benefit of a Japanese
television crew that is touring the United States filming a
half-hour history of the potato chip, which was supposed to have
been invented in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1853.

   Hard lessons came out of a fatal on-the-job
accident in Indiana. One was that occupational safety inspectors
can't be everywhere. Another, that workers compensation may cover
no more than funeral costs. This is the second part of an AP
series, ``Danger at Work.''

   When tragedy tore apart Linda Link's life,
she struggled with anguish. Then anger. Finally, she turned her
emotions into something else _ activism.
   She took up the fight for worker safety. It's little solace for
the loss of her son, Jeff, who died in an on-the-job accident, but
she's devoted to the cause. So are her comrades who share her
sorrow.
   There's Edna Freeze. Her son, Bill, died trying to save Jeff.
   And Bob Hensinger. His son, Larry, also was killed in the rescue
attempt.
   And Sue Irish. Her son, Barney, died, too, rushing to help the
others.
   And Brenda Fogle. Her son, Craig, the last man to come to his
co-workers' aid, died last. After two days in a coma, his
respirator was turned off.
   Five families buried sons, their futures unfulfilled, their fate
bound in tragedy. Now, more than a year after the young men _ ages
19 to 29 _ died in a toxic fume accident at Bastian Plating Co.,
their parents are writing letters, calling lawmakers, rallying _
and pleading, ``Never again.''
   ``If we can do any good, it gives us the satisfaction to know
that the boys didn't die in vain,'' Mrs. Link said. ``We can't
bring them back, but in their name, we can maybe help make it so
these things don't happen ever again. And it gives us something to
think about other than the tragedy.''
   ``You're hoping you'll change things ... you'll get people to
listen,'' Hensinger said. ``It's always worth a try. Only a fool
sits back and does nothing.''
   The families' goals are modest. No sweeping changes. Just a
little more caution and a lot more accountability from employers.
   ``Even if one factory would be really safe, that would make us
feel good,'' Mrs. Freeze said.
   The campaigners were brought together by the June 28, 1988,
tragedy at Bastian when Jeff was overcome by hydrogen cyanide fumes
while cleaning a holding tank. Bill, a plant worker just four
weeks, and Larry, climbed in to help, investigators were told.
   Barney, once Bill's schoolmate, valiantly tried to save them,
according to reports. Then Craig, the last rescuer, slid down the
side of the tank, hitting his head, his mother said.
   The workers didn't know zinc cyanide residue was in the
5-by-4-by-5 tank, said David Bear, spokesman for the Indiana
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Muriatic acid, a
dilute form of hydrochloric acid, was used for the cleaning, he
said, and the mixture produced the toxic gas.
   IOSHA fined Bastian $41,700, claiming it hadn't provided
adequate training, respirators or rescue equipment _ such as a
lifeline to pull workers out _ nor conducted air tests in the tank
before anyone entered.
   Bastian has contested the ``knowing'' violations and paid the
remainder, totaling $1,700. It has declined further comment since
releasing a statement shortly after the accident saying: ``We are
sorry that it took a tragedy of these proportions to focus
attention on the issue of industrial safety.''
   The parents say they knew the job could be hazardous; their sons
came home with arm or leg burns. Larry even told his ex-wife ```If
I don't get out, the job's going to kill me,''' his father said.
``I took it as a figure of speech.''
   After the accident, the families say Bastian made a terrible
situation worse by not telling them what happened.
   ``We need answers,'' Miss Irish said. ``A lot of them.''
   DeKalb County Prosecutor Monte Brown has been asked by a worker
safety watchdog group to convene a grand jury probe of the
accident, but has declined comment pending a report from the state
Department of Environmental Management.
   ``Five guys went to work and expected to return home,'' said
Bill Groth, the watchdog group's co-founder. ``They didn't.
Something went drastically wrong.''
   The families are frustrated, he added. ``They want to know why
there was a delay in calling the ambulances. ... They can't find
out what happened to their sons.''
   With Groth's guidance, the families have become activists,
meeting with consumer groups, holding news conferences and lobbying
for stronger OSHA enforcement, changes in workers compensation laws
and measures to allow injured employees to sue in cases where
employers remove warnings or safety devices from machines.
   ``It's a good catharsis for them,'' said Groth. ``We've
encouraged them to channel emotions in a positive way, through
political action. ...''
   They're also consulting with a lawyer, Mike Kendall, about the
possibility of legal action, though with few exceptions, workers
compensation is the exclusive remedy for on-the-job accidents.
   Kendall says the families have been ``radicalized by the
experience.''
   At the same time, they've learned a hard civics lesson,
discovering that government moves slowly, its agencies hamstrung by
rules, laws and dollars.
   ``I always thought OSHA inspected every place every year,'' Mrs.
Freeze said. ``They don't have the money or the inspectors to do
everything. ... It's going to have to be the employer that's going
to have to look out for his employees.''
   ``You get so many slaps in the face, all the things you find
out,'' Mrs. Link said.
   Workers compensation, for one.
   Jeff ``being a single person, all we got was $2,000 for funeral
expenses. They don't give you any compensation ... for the love you
lost,'' Mrs. Link said. ``Not that any amount of money can bring
him back.''
   Together, the families took flowers to the graves on the first
anniversary of the accident. It helps, but anger remains.
   ``They had their whole lives ahead of them. None of them were
married,'' Mrs. Fogle said. ``You have so many hopes and dreams for
your children. You never think you're going to have to bury your
children.''
   Now five families live with memories.
   Of Barney, who stopped by each morning to tell his mother he
loved her.
   Of Craig, who had a twinkle in his eye and a passion for music.
   Of Bill, who tinkered with cars and hoped to become a diesel
mechanic.
   Of Jeff, who loved the mountains. His parents plan to etch
scenes of Wyoming on his gravestone.
   And of Larry, whose tombstone reads: ``He gave his life for a
comrade.''
   ``You've got to go on,'' his father said, ``or it will eat you
up.''
   The families are trying to do that, confident their sons would
be proud of their crusade.
   ``Craig would say, `All right, Mom!,'' Mrs. Fogle said. ``I can
just hear him say, `Go for it!'''

   Imagine working in a factory
where dense smoke and gases make it hard to see or breathe, toxic
dusts coat the floor and the heat in some spots approaches 250
degrees _ beyond boiling water.
   This isn't a 19th-century sweatshop but, prosecutors claim, a
modern-day plant, the Chicago Magnet Wire Corp., a place so
hazardous that the people who ran it were nothing short of criminal.
   Five current and former Chicago Magnet executives await trial on
charges that they knowingly allowed conditions that gave more than
40 workers nerve and lung disorders and other ailments. The U.S.
Supreme Court refused this month to hear their appeal, challenging
local prosecutors' jurisdiction.
   This case is among a small but growing number of criminal
charges filed against company officials for workplace deaths and
injuries. There have been others in California, Wisconsin, Michian,
Indiana, New York, Texas and Illinois, the latter the site of the
nation's first corporate murder convictions for an employee's
cyanide poisoning.
   ``We're likely to see more criminal prosecutions in this area,''
said James Holzhauer, a University of Chicago law school lecturer.
   Some prosecutors argue that monetary penalties imposed by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration are often too small
to deter employers.
   ``Some people don't care if they're fined. They pass that along
to the consumer,'' said Frank Parkerson, a Cook County prosecutor
in the Chicago Magnet case. ``People do care about going to jail
for 25 years.''
   ``This is not applying a different standard to employers than we
apply to every other citizen,'' said Ken Oden, Travis County
attorney in Texas. ``You can't drive 120 miles an hour out of a
school zone, run over a child and say you can't be criminally
responsible because you didn't intend the results.''
   But opponents say this approach could lead to a patchwork of
local and state safety standards and undercuts OSHA, which has
referred 55 cases to the Justice Department for criminal
prosecution since its formation in 1970. About a quarter were
settled in pleas or trials, and the Justice Department declined
prosecution in the rest, OSHA said.
   Workplace prosecutions are ``basically unfair to business and I
don't think it advances workers' safety and health,'' said Stephen
Bokat, U.S. Chamber of Commerce general counsel.
   ``Corporate executives have no warning of what's expected of
them,'' added Bokat, who filed a brief in the Chicago Magnet case.
``It's really an after-the-fact determination by a prosecutor that
something's not safe.''
   A key contention in this debate _ that OSHA pre-empts local
prosecutions _ reached the U.S. Supreme Court after being rejected
by the Illinois Supreme Court, which said ``state criminal law can
provide a valuable and forceful supplement'' for worker protection.
   Attorneys for Chicago Magnet argued that local prosecutors and
juries, who may be ``uninformed and ... unconcerned,'' are less
qualified to ensure safety than experienced federal officials who
set uniform standards.
   ``Whether criminal laws should be applied is a legislative
decision,'' added attorney Robert Stephenson. ``If (you) want to do
something, change the law.''
   But the Supreme Court let stand the Illinois ruling.
   The pre-emption issue didn't stop the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office, which has a special unit for such cases.
   Four people convicted of involuntary manslaughter have served
jail terms and nearly 30 misdemeanors have been prosecuted, said
Fred Macksoud, deputy district attorney.
   ``These are cases where the employers were just cutting corners
more than anything,'' he said. ``They thought they could get away
with it. ... (But) they kill people by cutting corners.''
   The average fine ranges from $11,000 to $30,000, Macksoud added,
about five times higher than OSHA's civil penalties.
   Despite some successes, prosecutors filing criminal charges in
workplace accident cases are trying ``to put new wine in an old
bottle,'' in the view of Bill Maakestead, associate professor of
business law and management at Western Illinois University, who
does not expect a proliferation of prosecutions.
   ``These cases tend to be the more expensive, the more time
consuming'' and require investigative expertise often lacking in
prosecutors' offices, he said, terming effective OSHA standards a
better way to ensure safety.
   Even so, he added, ``in egregious cases, you need that kind of
symbolic legal mechanism to send a strong signal.''
   Experts say that message was sent in the 1985 landmark murder
conviction of three officials of Film Recovery Systems Inc. of Elk
Grove Village in the cyanide poisoning of Stefan Golab, a Polish
immigrant working in the silver recovery plant.
   Golab had to work over open vats of cyanide solution but wasn't
informed of the risks or given adequate protective gear _
prosecutors said paper masks were provided. He also was refused a
transfer after showing cyanide exposure symptoms.
   Workers testified they suffered headaches, dizziness and
vomiting. One said the only time respirators were provided was when
an inspector visited.
   Judge Ronald Banks called Golab's death ``not accidental, but in
fact murder.'' The convictions are being appealed.
   In the Chicago Magnet case, the company and five officials are
accused of aggravated battery, reckless conduct and conspiracy.
Prosecutors said the plant was comparable to ``the `sweat shops' of
the mid-19th century.''
   ``Abominable'' was prosecutor Parkerson's description of
conditions at the plant where wire was coated with polyvinyl
chloride and other chemicals.
   Court papers claim temperatures on the catwalks approached 250
degrees, the air was smoky, workers weren't given adequate masks,
gloves or boots, they were exposed to the kinds of gases used as
weapons during World War I and were hit in the chest, face, head
and neck with broken wire fragments.
   Prosecutors claim 43 workers suffered nerve disorders,
impotence, kidney failure, toxic hepatitis or other injuries. One
doctor said the combination of aluminum dust on the floor and
another chemical used at the hot plant causes brain damage and is
associated with Alzheimer's disease.
   Until 1982, Parkerson said, the plant averaged more than four
times as many injuries as employees.
   OSHA said it last inspected Chicago Magnet in August 1988 and no
citations were issued. Four citations in the previous 12 years,
alleging noise violations, failure to inspect respirators and other
infractions, were settled for minimal amounts.
   The defense has thus far addressed only pre-emption. But Bokat's
brief says the state ``has never contested the defendants' claim
that working conditions were in compliance with OSHA standards.''
   Parkerson said the opportunity hasn't arisen yet.
   ``OSHA just can't deal with people who have no intention of
following the law at all,'' he said.
   ``The basic problem is the whole mentality of the business,
which deals only in money, profits and losses and accepts the idea
implicitly that human health, safety and life is expendable to some
degree. We've got to change that kind of attitude.''

   Criminal prosecutions have been initiated in a wide variety of
work-related deaths and injuries. Here are outlines of some recent
cases.
   MICHIGAN _ Prosecutors are awaiting a decision from the Michigan
Court of Appeals on whether there's sufficient evidence to go to
trial in the carbon-monoxide death of an employee of a company that
installed cable TV wires. Prosecutors want to try a company foreman
on involuntary manslaughter charges, claiming he knew the van the
man died in had a faulty exhaust system. Two lower courts have
ruled opposite ways on the evidence issue.
   WISCONSIN _ A jury convicted a company of reckless homicide in
the death of a man who drove a front-end loader off a 60-foot
cliff. The company, the prosecutor said, knew the man had a history
of epilepsy, provided less than 40 hours of training and had no
on-site supervisor. Another company pleaded no contest to an
endangerment charge and was fined in the death of a worker killed
in a crane collapse.
   TEXAS _ Two construction companies and one executive were
convicted of criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of three
workers in separate trench cave-ins. The three convictions were
overturned on the ground that state law was pre-empted by federal
occupational safety regulations. They are being appealed. A third
company has been charged in a similar case.
   NEW YORK _ An appeal is pending in the assault convictions of
two executives of Pymm Thermometer Corp. for exposing workers to
toxic mercury. A judge dismissed the verdict on pre-emption grounds.

<HEAD>Estefan's Return to Roots Turns Nice Gesture Into Smart Business</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With the recording of two of the Miaimi Sound
Machine's latest songs in Spanish as well as English, Gloria
Estefan's return to her roots is not only a nice gesture, but smart
business.
   Estefan, a Cuban immigrant, recorded and released her hit song
``Don't Want to Lose You'' in English and Spanish this summer.
Another song, ``Oye Mi Canto'' (``Hear My Voice''), was just
released in Europe with the bilingual touch. Even the music videos
were done in both languages.
   ``I just thought it was a little plus,'' Estefan said prior to
leaving on a European concert tour. ``I don't want to alienate my
Spanish fans because they have been good to me for a long time.''
   The Miami Sound Machine is one of the first major rock groups to
put both a Spanish and English version of the same song on one LP.
   ``Cuts Both Ways'' has hit the top of the charts, and the
compact discs and cassettes have the two different versions.
   ``What is happening for the Spanish-speaking people is they feel
proud about it because you didn't forget them, so you identify with
them,'' said Emilio Estefan, Gloria's husband and music producer
who also is a Cuban immigrant. ``For the American people, it's
something new. And they like it.''
   That tested true when Estefan and the group recorded and
released ``Anything for You'' in both English and Spanish a couple
of years ago.
   ```Anything for You,' in English was a hit, and the Spanish
version gave it that final kick,'' said Larry Stessel, vice
president of West Coast operations in Los Angeles for CBS records,
the label that distributes the Miami Sound Machine.
   That ``final kick,'' perhaps, is coming from the growing
audience of Hispanics in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau
estimates the country's Hispanic popluation will have grown by 34.5
in the last 10 years. Yet, the total population is expected to have
grown only 9.9 percent.
   And that Hispanic population is younger than the overall
population, which translates into more sales and more exposure.
   Irish rocker Laura Branigan said she hopes to capture a bigger
Hispanic market by making two separate albums. Branigan, who
recorded ``Gloria'' in 1982, is working on two albums that will
have the same music but English lyrics on one and Spanish on the
other.
   Other artists also have cashed in on the growing market. Most
artists have taken their hit English songs and then translated them
into Spanish, such as Suzanne Vega who did her Top 10 hit ``Luka,''
and Sting who did the same with ``Fragile.''
   But few if any have put the Spanish-version songs on a new album
and released the songs to radio listeners in both languages at the
same time, Estefan said.
   ``We don't do it because it's more commercial or because we want
to sell more albums. We do it because it's very natural for us,''
Estefan said. ``People feel proud about it, and we feel very lucky
that we've been able to do something for our people.''
   And it's that sensitivity that makes Gloria Estefan and the
Miami Sound Machine unique, Stessel said. If Bon Jovi wanted to
record and release a song in both English and Spanish, Stessel said
it might not work as well.
   ``I don't think that it's necessarily where rock 'n' roll is
going. I think if gets back to what comes naturally,'' Stessel
said. ``Gloria does it because she's Cuban. This is something she
does naturally.''

<HEAD>In Its Second Decade, Face of AIDS Will Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The frightening scourge of the '80s, AIDS, is
not likely to be defeated in the '90s. But new weapons may give its
victims a fighting chance. This is one of a periodic series of
articles, ``The '90s,'' looking ahead to the promise and peril of
the upcoming decade, in the environment, medicine, technology and
society.

<TEXT>
   In the 1980s, AIDS in the United States was largely an
untreatable disease of middle-class white homosexuals. In the
1990s, it is likely to be a treatable disease of poor black and
Hispanic heterosexuals.
   And worldwide, by the end of the '90s, six million people may be
ill with AIDS, the specialists project.
   In the second decade of this epidemic upon the Earth, the face
of AIDS will change:
   _It will be increasingly linked with poverty, passed through the
nation's slums via needles and sex.
   _The number of people with AIDS will grow dramatically as those
who were infected throughout the 1980s fall sick.
   _Medical science will develop more tools to control HIV, the
AIDS virus, perhaps slowing the lethal course of the infection.
   As acquired immune deficiency syndrome spreads, the burden upon
society will grow with it.
   The U.S. government estimates the cost of taking care of AIDS
patients in 1992 will range from $5 billion to $13 billion.
Big-city hospitals, especially those in poor neighborhoods, will be
hit hardest. Experts believe New York City will need 1,000 to 1,500
more beds by 1991 just to deal with AIDS patients.
   The seeds of the epidemic's next decade have already been sown.
An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million Americans are now infected.
Most, perhaps all, will eventually become ill.
   ``Even if not another single person gets infected, which of
course won't happen, there will be a steady increase in the number
of people who get sick and die from AIDS over the next 10 years,''
said Dr. William Haseltine of Dana Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston.
   By the end of 1992, the U.S. Public Health Service projects,
365,000 Americans will have gotten AIDS, and 263,000 of them will
have died. In 1992 alone, there will be 80,000 new cases of AIDS
and 65,000 deaths.
   The virus typically lingers quietly for a decade after the
initial infection until it eventually destroys the immune system,
causing AIDS. The victims of the early 1990s will be the legacy of
the epidemic's silent but explosive start in the early 1980s.
   Most early victims were homosexual men. Because of safer sex
habits, the rate of new infections has slowed to a trickle among
this group. But the virus continues to spread through shared
needles among drug addicts, largely poor black and Hispanic males
in the big cities, and from them to their sex partners, mostly
women.
   The future of AIDS in the United States will depend, in part, on
whether those who catch AIDS through sex with drug abusers will
pass it on sexually to others. If this happens _ there is no
evidence of it yet _ AIDS could become a sexually transmitted
disease of the urban poor.
   ``That's the big question mark that hangs over the next
decade,'' said Dr. Andrew R. Moss of the University of California,
San Francisco.
   The heterosexual transmission of AIDS is already a major problem
in other parts of the world, especially Africa, where 10 percent to
15 percent of the people in some cities are thought to be infected.
   ``We expect that the decade of the 1990s will be worse _ and
perhaps much worse _ than the 1980s,'' said Dr. Jonathan M. Mann,
director of the World Health Organization's AIDS program.
   The WHO has put together the educated guesses of many experts
and projects that nine times more people around the world will get
AIDS during the 1990s than during the 1980s. By the year 2000,
there could be 6 million AIDS cases, and 18 million people could be
infected.
   Just how many people will have AIDS in the United States a
decade from now is impossible to predict with any certainty.
   ``What happens 10 years from now will reflect transmission that
hasn't yet occurred,'' said Dr. Timothy Dondero of the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control. ``There are a lot of unknowns, but to me the
biggest _ because it's likely to have the most radical change _ is
the impact of preventive therapy in infected people to prevent the
onset of AIDS.''
   Recently, researchers showed that the drug AZT can forestall the
development of AIDS in infected people who are not yet sick. If all
goes as scientists hope, other drugs under development will attack
the virus at various stages in its life cycle. The goal is to hold
the virus in check.
   ``HIV infection would become a chronic disease, a lifelong
disease, something for which you would need to take medication for
a long time, like hypertension or diabetes,'' said Dr. Clifford
Lane of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
``Some people will still do poorly, but hopefully the majority will
be able to do much better.''
   Instead of succumbing to AIDS 10 years after infection, people
might live with the virus in relatively good health for 20 or 30
years.
   Many experts are less optimistic about finding a vaccine that
will protect people from the initial AIDS infection. The difficulty
is in priming the body to put up impenetrable barriers that will
prevent every single invading virus from taking root in vulnerable
blood cells.
   ``We know it's going to be exceedingly difficult, based on all
the immune information that has been generated,'' said Dr. David Ho
of Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ``It looks harder,
rather than easier, as we learn more and more.''

<TEXT>
   Party flags, T-shirts and posters,
paraphernalia of Namibia's independence-election campaign, abound
in this remote outpost of the diminutive Bushmen, the territory's
earliest inhabitants.
   But the crucial issue among them is not independence from South
Africa; it's survival.
   Bushman farmers, limited to a fraction of their traditional
territory, hope to retain enough land to raise themselves just to
subsistence levels when Namibia becomes independent after the
voting Nov. 7-11.
   Those Bushmen who fought for South Africa during a 23-year war
against pro-independence guerrillas in Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa, are living off their last military paychecks and
waiting to hear the army's plans for their future. Others languish
in the slums of Bushmanland's only town, Tshumkwe.
   The third smallest of Namibia's 11 ethnic groups, the 33,000
Bushmen have never been united politically. They are scattered
across an arid territory and speak a half-dozen languages,
including Afrikaans, the language of the majority of South Africa's
whites.
   Thirty years ago, some Namibian Bushmen survived solely by
hunting and gathering, as did their ancestors. Today, even the
Ju@wa in eastern Bushmanland, the only group still in possession of
its traditional hunting grounds, must raise cattle and vegetables
to survive.
   Toma, a young Bushman who speaks Afrikaans as well as Ju@wa's
clicking language, said the elections mark the first time his
people have been wooed by political parties. He hopes independence
will bring a high school and more shops in Tshumkwe, a job for him,
and a better house for his family in the tiny, grass-hut village of
Gautcha.
   The United Nations-supervised elections will determine the
make-up of a constitution-writing assembly. Independence, after 74
years of South African rule, will come once the constitution and
new government are in place.
   Although elections are new to the Bushmen, they know the rural
development policies of the new government could affect them
dramatically.
   They have been invited to community meetings by officials of the
South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the guerrilla
movement that is the front-runner in the campaign. They have
received free food and T-shirts from supporters of SWAPO's main
rival, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.
   SWAPO says it plans to redistribute unused or foreign-owned land
to those without property, but Theo-Ben Gurirab, a senior SWAPO
official, said the party wants to get away from ethnic stereotypes.
   He added that he believes Bushmen have become the focus of what
he calls disproportionate and misguided concern, particularly
abroad, over what might happen to the Bushmen, their traditions and
cultures.
   ``We do not want to lock them in a zoo for foreigners to come
and experiment on how they used to live,'' Gurirab said. ``We're
going to look at them as citizens of Namibia whose needs should be
attended to.''
   Gurirab condemned as ``sinister'' suggestions by South African
officials to move to South Africa Bushmen soldiers worried about
their future in independent Namibia.
   Erno Gauerke, an official of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
said Bushmen were struggling through a difficult transition from
traditional to modern society. He said his party, a multiracial,
pro-capitalist coalition, would try to promote rural agricultural
development and a shift from communal to private land use.
   John Marshall of the Ju@wa Bushman Development Foundation said
the Bushmen now are Namibia's equivalent of India's
``untouchables.'' But he said increasing numbers of other Namibians
could face similar hardship unless economic trends are reversed.
   Marshall, an American filmmaker and anthropolgist whose
organization seeks to promote small-scale farming projects in
Bushmanland, said the Bushmen are trapped between outsiders'
sentimental views that they should be protected from the modern
world and the reality of their poverty.
   They face ``death by myth,'' he said, when what they want is a
chance to achieve self-sufficiency.
   The Namibian Bushman population has declined at a rate of about
5 percent every 10 years, Marshall said.
   The Rev. Ferdie Weich of the Dutch Reformed Church, who has done
missionary work in several Bushmen communities, said illiteracy is
widespread.
   ``At school, there's a certain amount of unidentifiable
discrimination against the Bushmen,'' he said.
   Because of the scarcity of teachers who speak their languages,
Bushman children are taught in Afrikaans.
   The Bushmen will be dependent for several generations on outside
financial help and on the perserverance of those who try to assist
them, Weich said.
   The Ju@wa foundation has helped establish 20 new villages in
Bushmanland where residents tend gardens and raise cattle as well
as hunt and gather.
   Project director Megan Biesele said the farming cooperative they
have formed is an attempt to translate their ancient system of land
use into modern terms to gain leasehold over the area.
   The foundation hopes to establish 15 more villages of 30 to 35
people each and to improve education and health services.

<HEAD>Bulldozers Chance Upon Ancient Buried City on Egyptian Coast</HEAD>

   Construction workers carving out a
road for an elite Mediterranean resort bulldozed their way into an
ancient world under a blanket of seaside sand.
   They had stumbled upon a city more than 2,000 years old and
stretching for more than a mile along Egypt's coastline 125 miles
west of Alexandria.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Ali Hassan, who controls Egyptian
Antiquities Organization operations in the region. ``Other
countries get excited about finding an ancient house. We have a
whole city. It's without equal in all of Egypt.''
   The bulldozers were stopped a month after the ruins were
discovered in 1985. By that time, a road had been sliced through
what appears to have been an ancient temple, but much more remained.
   A few months later, Egyptian and Polish archaeologists began
excavating the ruins, without letting word out, and what they've
found over the last three years is in remarkable condition.
   ``What we have in hand is a golden egg, undisturbed, a complete
city that changed with time,'' said Hassan, director general of
Pharaonic monuments. ``It's not only a city of the dead, but also a
city of the living, side by side. It's something very rare and very
important.''
   The city, believed to have been founded in the second century
B.C., lasted more than 500 years. As excavators intruded on its
serenity since 1986, antiquities officials have worked quietly in
Cairo to save the site from further destruction.
   The still-unidentified city now peeks in and out of its sandy
grave.
   To one side stands a row of ultramodern apartments built along
the coastline by Egypt's Ministry of Housing. A new apartment
complex was to have been erected on top of what turned out to be
the ruins.
   ``The site is under our protection,'' said Sayeed Tawfik,
chairman of the antiquities organization. ``Nothing can happen to
it now.''
   Only a small area has been excavated, but archaeologists already
have discovered well-preserved houses, vast cemeteries with
decorated and undecorated tombs, catacombs, a bath, a basilica and
many artifacts, imported and local, including statues and frescoes.
   Egyptian excavators are now at work. In February they'll be
rejoined by 10 Polish archaeologists and restorers to make detailed
surveys of the site and its needs.
   They already have restored critical pieces that had begun to
disintegrate since the bulldozing of the road.
   Walking through the excavations, Feisal Mohammed Ashmy, the
antiquities inspector in charge of the ancient city, pointed toward
mounds of toppled marble columns. They lay at the crest of a
man-made ditch 35 feet wide and 10 feet deep _ an ancient road.
   ``Before the bulldozers got here, this was a temple, I think.
It's terrible, but we now have to focus on saving what's left,'' he
said.
   ``There's so much. All you have to do is to look down, and
history says, `Take me.'''
   Early historians recorded a number of small coastal cities along
Egypt's Mediterranean coastline. Villages of white houses, fishing
boats and nets, and later the domes of early Christian churches,
dotted the landscape. Vineyards, olive groves, fruit trees and
almonds were plentiful. Families on outings sailed to outlying
islands to drink wine.
   W.A. Daszewski, head of the Polish Archaeological Institite in
Egypt and an expert in the Greco-Roman period, said he's delighted
with the find.
   ``This is a great opportunity for us to see how it was. It's a
unique chance to understand the quality of housing during this
period,'' he said in an interview.
   ``This was a landowners' city. ... They probably had farms
inland, but residents preferred to have their houses along the
coast because of the cooler climate.''
   Excavated houses are large, with complex systems that carried
rainwater from the roof to basement cisterns. Some are elaborately
decorated with pillars, niches, statues and delicate frescoes.
   ``The architectural decoration in the city is first class and
well-preserved,'' Daszewski said.
   Designs on tombs range from simple pits through small step
pyramids to magnificent, multistoried funerary complexes. Daszewski
said burials date from the second century B.C. to the end of the
third century A.D., but he believes the city existed in some form
until the early seventh century.
   Daszewski said he knows of two possible names for the city:
Leucaspis _ white shield _ which would refer to a sandspit that
protected the harbor; and Antiphre or Antiphra, a city mentioned as
late as the fourth century A.D. because of a bishop who hailed from
there.
   ``Both are possibilities, but we have a basilica here, so the
city existed during early Christian times,'' Daszewski said. ``I
rather think it's Antiphre, but it's possible the city was called
one thing, the harbor area another. We don't know.''
   The Polish and Egyptian archaeologists predict it'll be years
before excavation and restoration is completed.
   ``Maybe 10, maybe 15, maybe more,'' said antiquities official
Ali Hassan.

<HEAD>Tokyo Film Festival Showcases Young Filmmakers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo International Film Festival, still a
fledgling event its third time around, is making its mark by
awarding the largest cash prize at any film festival to young and
first-time filmmakers from around the world.
   This year, Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso won the Sakura Gold
prize of $143,000 for ``Yaaba'' (``Old Woman''). The Sakura Silver
prize of $71,000 went to Shunichi Nagasaki of Japan for ``The
Enchantment.''
   The 30 million yen ($214,000) prize represents a significant
amount of freedom, said director George Miller (``Witches of
Eastwick,'' ``Mad Max''), a member of the jury that also included
actor Willem Dafoe.
   ``I don't know any young filmmaker who wouldn't regard that
amount of money as something very useful to their career,'' Miller
said. ``I think the Tokyo festival may become known as a major
attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the
recognition.''
   The 10-day festival ended Oct. 8 with ``Dead Poets Society,''
starring Robin Williams. It presented 133 movies, including Bill
Forsyth's ``Breaking In,'' Ron Howard's ``Parenthood'' and Yahoo
Serious' ``Young Einstein.''
   The grand prize went to ``That Summer of White Roses'' by Rajko
Grlic of Yugoslavia. A Special Jury Prize was given to
``Intergirl'' by the Soviet Union's Pyotr Todorovsky. Other winners
included: Elena Yakovleva, ``Intergirl'' (best actress); and Marlon
Brando, ``A Dry White Season'' (best actor).
   The Young Cinema Competition was established at the first Tokyo
festival in 1985 to encourage young directors with cash prizes of
$1.5 million.
   But the cash prize shrunk after festival organizers discovered
that some of the winners were constrained at home in using the
money solely for new film projects, and others subsequently
produced less-than-commercial movies with the money.
   Still, the competition is an attraction to young directors. Some
327 movies were entered in this year's festival, and the field was
narrowed to 17 films from 14 countries.
   The Tokyo Festival, held every other year, is still trying to
find its place among the more glamorous and prestigious film
festivals of the world, such as the Cannes Film Festival in France.
The Tokyo event is neither a center of behind-the-scenes dealmaking
nor a site of many important world premieres.
   ``The Tokyo festival is purely a matter of international
prestige,'' said Vincent Tolentino, Hollywood correspondent for the
French entertainment magazine Telerama.
   ``No one makes deals here, and most of the films have been seen
before at other festivals. Producers and film distributors might
touch base, but it's all public relations,'' he said.
   But festival organizers saw an opportunity to boost the film
projects of fledgling directors using one thing of which Japan has
plenty: money.
   ``We're certainly not the first film festival, so we started the
young cinema competition because we wanted to be known for
something special,'' said Michio Morioka, director of the
festival's ``Young Cinema Competition.''
   ``We regard it as very important to aid the abilities and
talents of young filmmakers,'' said Morioka, a former producer with
Toho Co., one of Japan's major movie companies.
   The fesitval costs about $5 million and about 10 percent comes
from the government. Because of the high costs, it isn't an annual
event such as most international film gatherings.
   The world's biggest and most publicity-prone film fesitval, at
Cannes, now gives $39,000 to the winner of its young director's
award, and the Montreal, Canada, festival awards 50,000 Canadian
dollars ($42,700) to the best first film.
   Another feature of the young cinema competition is that
directors, and often actors, attend public showings of their films
and appear onstage afterwards to discuss the movie with the
audience.
   During one such discussion, Eric Rochant, the 28-year-old
director of ``Tough Life,'' was told by a young man that in the
Japanese studio system, an aspiring film director must labor as
long as 15 or 20 years before getting the chance to make his own
feature-length film.
   Rochant said he, too, had to fight the odds, and to circumvent
the usual way of making a film in France to create ``Tough Life,''
the story of a young Parisian's alienation from life and love.
   ``In cinema, you must take risks like in everything else. The
only way to do it is to do it,'' he said.

   After 6{ years with CBS News, more than two of
those with the now-extinct ``West 57th'' series, Jane Wallace quit.
Her star was rising then. But her patience with the gypsy life had
fallen.
   ``I'd had it with traveling 250,000 miles a year,'' she said.
The pay was good. She got to cover a small war, among other things,
and was a summer-substitute anchor in 1984 on the ``CBS Evening
News.''
   But she was always on the go. It seemed altogether checkout
time, she says, when she realized that ``my close personal friends
were taxi drivers and car rental people.''
   Now, having moved to Miami and served as host for two ``People''
magazine TV specials since leaving CBS in 1987, she is starting
life anew in cable, in her own one-hour weekday talk show on the
Lifetime network.
   ``The Jane Wallace Show'' is the new job. Premiering today, it's
taped with a studio audience in Astoria, near Manhattan. One
audience member at her first taping: Meredith Vieira, now with CBS'
``60 Minutes.''
   A class act, Wallace said of her old ``West 57th'' colleague and
pal.
   She spoke by phone last week while changing her clothes for the
second show of the day. ``I'm trying to get my shirt over my head,
hang on,'' she said, laughing.
   Her new network says it serves nearly 44 million of the nation's
50.9 million homes with cable. Its programming seeks a female
audience.
   But she says her show _ which she eventually hopes to do live _
won't do issues ``that you would stereotypically define as women's
issues all the time. We just finished taping one about mothers on
crack.
   ``And we're about to do a show on Phoebe Snow, who has spent the
last eight years raising a handicapped child. Which is why she
dropped out of music. The show's not exclusively aimed at women.''
   Sure, Lifetime, partly owned by ABC, ``is a woman's network,''
she says. ``But it's not as if a man tunes in, he's going to get a
... rash. We're looking to broaden what women's issues are
considered to be.''
   Perhaps the only talk show host around nowadays with a degree in
political science from Yale, Wallace, from St. Paul, Minn., has
paid her journalistic dues. She worked as a general assignment
reporter at stations in New Haven, Conn., Denver and here before
joining CBS News in 1981.
   She has a breezy, no-nonsense manner and a sense of humor that
at times can be, well, salty.
   A few million viewers noticed this one day in 1984 when, while
subanchoring ``The CBS Morning News,'' she emitted an opinion that
became a highlight on a much-copied tape of Great Moments in
Broadcasting.
   She had been discussing a sci-fi movie with the show's other
fill-in anchor, Bill Plante. Props from the film were put on their
desk. She and Plante were told they had four minutes to fill and to
discuss the props.
   They did, but it wasn't easy. Finally, when she thought the show
had cut to a commercial, she turned to Plante, she recalls, and
said, ``I couldn't booshwah about this another minute if my life
depended on it.''
   (She used a naughtier word than booshwah. We have changed the
word to protect the innocent.)
   The studio became ``hush-quiet,'' she said. ``I had to say to a
technician, `Excuse me, did that go out on the air? Because I sure
didn't mean for it to.''' It sure went out on the air, the
technician said.
   After the commercials, a chastened Wallace apologized on the
air. A few industry observers and inmates subsequently thought she
had been knocking the show. Not so, she says. ``In fact, I was just
saying that I couldn't keep babbling about nothing.''
   In some TV circles, such heresy would prompt demands she be
impaled on a Nielsen point. Be that as it may, would she ever want
to return to life as a network correspondent?
   ``I have missed some of the people and some of the work,''
Wallace replied. ``I have to say that to be honest ... and there
are times I miss investigative reporting the most.
   ``At the same time, do I want to come back to that life? Uh,
no.''

<HEAD>Wariness About The Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's first mass-consumption society
emerged in the United States in the 20th century, greatly raised
the material standard of living and reinforced the people's innate
optimism.
   Studying the phenomenon, some behavioral scientists found that
Americans could be distinguished from their European cousins simply
by their level of optimism. Americans expected things to get
better; others weren't sure.
   Into the 1970s, studies showed Americans usually expected to be
better off financially in the future and to have more material
comforts. They expected to do better than their parents, and their
children to do better than them.
   Why not? In the years after World War II many millions of jobs
were created, real incomes rose, people could afford cars and
houses and invest in stocks and bonds. They earned pension rights.
They had medical insurance.
   But something also may have happened to that optimism.
   In a survey whose intent was to examine hopes and fears for the
1990s, hundreds of Americans revealed a persistent strain of
wariness or realism that has become mixed with the traditional high
hopes and confidence.
   ``The 1990s will be a decade in which the American public is not
without optimism, but neither are they without pessimism,'' said
Frank A. Bennack Jr., in announcing the results.
   ``We have discovered that, overall, people have what I believe
must be characterized as a somber view of the 1990s,'' he said.
   Bennack is president and chief executive officer of The Hearst
Corporation, which for the past six years has commissioned studies
of American attitudes on major issues. By its nature, this one
looked into the future, a gray one.
   The largest percentage of those surveyed, some 38 percent,
expressed the opinion that the American standard of living will
stay the same; 29 percent said it would decline. A minority, 31
percent, said it would improve.
   The same doubts appeared elsewhere in the survey. Forty-one
percent said their personal life would be better than now in the
year 2000, but 31 percent said it would be about the same and 23
percent expected it to be worse.
   Thirty-eight percent said they felt the financial standard of
living for all Americans would stay about the same in the 1990s, 29
percent said it would decline and only 31 percent said they
expected improvement.
   The survey itself revealed some of the economic reasons for
apprehension. The national deficit was cited by 30 percent as the
single greatest threat to the economy. Others named the trade
imbalance. Few named recession.
   Forty-six percent of the respondents held the view that prices
of single-family houses will be much higher 10 years from now, a
fear that contrasts with professional opinion that housing demand
will ease after the mid-1990s.
   Asked their opinion of the emerging European Economic Community,
scheduled to become effective in 1992, about three in five said it
would create trade and economic problems for the United States.
Problems? Not opportunities?
   Other areas of the survey suggested more reasons for the mixed
views about the future. Based on the survey, Bennack said more than
half the American public expects terrorism will become a major
problem within the United States.
   A roughly similar percentage agreed that the 1990s would be ``a
decade of peace interrupted occasionally by regional military
conflict.''
   Bennack summed it up this way:
   ``(People) feel relatively confident about their own lives but
confidence about `the big picture' eludes them; there's an element
of uncertainty, even pessimism, concerning our society's future.''
   Affluence, it seems, has made people concerned about assets and
greater education has made them aware of the frail fabric of
society. They want more than goods. A mass consumption society
solves problems _ and creates them too.

<HEAD>South Carolina on Long Road to Recovery After Devastating Storm</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhotos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Music and laughter drift into the
streets from restaurants and nightspots one month after Hurricane
Hugo slammed into this antebellum city.
   But recovery from the worst disaster to befall South Carolina in
a century will be a long time coming as people rebuild splintered
homes, shattered dreams and a reeling economy.
   ``There are a lot of emotional scars out there that will take a
long time healing,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said last week.
``Everybody would like to have things just like they were and
that's not going to be.''
   Progress has been made since the storm came ashore in Charleston
on Sept. 21, killing 18 across South Carolina, and leaving 65,000
homeless, 1 million in the dark, 270,000 jobless and $4 billion in
damage.
   Schools have reopened and power has been restored. Roads have
been cleared and the swing bridge linking the mainland and barrier
islands northeast of Charleston is back in place.
   Armed National Guardsmen who patrolled once-shattered streets
and Army troops who helped clear debris are long gone.
   Restaurants and hotels have reopened, but business is slow.
   ``Normally October and April are our busiest months of the year.
Hopefully, things will be better in the spring,'' said Jeff Miller,
co-owner of Josiah's House restaurant in downtown Charleston.
   Sixty-three buildings collapsed and hundreds of historic
structures were damaged in Charleston where piles of debris wait to
be carted from some streets. Local officials hope to have most of
it cleared in two weeks.
   Across the Cooper River in suburban Mount Pleasant, blue plastic
sheets still protect roofs torn apart by Hugo's winds. Meanwhile,
trees, siding, roofs and furnishings from oceanfront homes litter
Isle of Palms.
   Thirty miles to the northeast, where the shrimping village of
McClellanville bore the brunt of the storm, trawlers tossed onto
land as if they were toys are being carted away for repairs.
   Farther up the coast, the storm cut Pawley's Island in half. The
breech has been filled, but oceanfront gaps remain where homes were
washed away.
   Sumter, 100 miles inland, was among the hardest hit areas.
Damage to utilities, homes and businesses was estimated at $100
million.
   The American Red Cross estimates more than 23,000 homes were
destroyed or suffered heavy damage statewide. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency has distributed nearly $5 million for uninsured
losses and temporary housing.
   Eighty-seven people remained in the two Red Cross shelters still
open last week, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Quirk.
   ``We still have a long way to go,'' she said, noting the agency
is serving more than 2,000 meals a day at 23 sites around the state.
   Families left homeless after the hurricane flooded a low-income
housing project in Charleston do not know what to do next.
   ``I don't know where I'm going to live,'' said 78-year-old Rosa
Furgeson who sought refuge in Ebenezer A.M.E. Church. ``The only
thing I wish is they could turn me out to a shelter of my own.''
   Children are living in a church shelter and attending school in
Georgetown because their homes 25 miles away in McClellanville were
destroyed.
   ``I cried the first day I went to school in Georgetown because I
miss my home, my school and everything,'' Dominique Grant said.
   Gov. Campbell said housing is a top priority, followed by
reviving the state's $4.7 billion tourism economy by next summer.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. has already urged visitors to return
to Charleston and officals in Myrtle Beach are mounting a $1.6
million advertising campaign to lure vacationers.
   ``We need to let the world know we're OK,'' said J. Michael
Pate, the publisher of The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. ``Even though
we've taken a pretty hard blow, we're still in business.''
   South Carolina's beaches, which attract upwards of 15 million
visitors a year, were hit hard by the storm.
   Crews worked feverishly to build a sand berm to protect
oceanfront structures from the highest tides in a decade last week.
The water lapped harmlessly against the dunes and Campbell was
criticized by some for pushing the multimillion-dollar project when
people remain homeless.
   But the governor had no apologies, saying getting the beaches
back in shape is a key to jump-starting the tourism economy.
   Hugo's winds snapped trees, causing an estimated $1 billion loss
for the timber industry, enough to build a house for every family
in West Virginia.
   The farming and fishing industries also were shattered, as Hugo
destroyed barns, boats and packing houses. The state Department of
Agriculture estimates $303 million in damage to crops, buildings
and livestock statewide.
   In McClellanville, shrimpers face the prospect of a bleak winter
before they can make repairs and get back in business. But
residents promise to rebuild.
   Mary Linen has bad dreams about the storm when she tied her
mother and two children to the porch of her home so they wouldn't
be washed away.
   ``I have nightmares like I'm fighting for my life again,'' she
said. ``But I still say we are blessed. Material things can be
replaced.''

<HEAD>Man-Made Wall Challenges Manhattan Climbers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on sports wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The handful of rock climbers who insist on
pursuing their obscure sport amid the skyscrapers of Manhattan have
decided to do something about the acute shortage of cliffs: They've
built an indoor climbing wall.
   Clambering across a plywood crag may lack the visceral thrills
of scaling a 300-foot cliff in upstate New York or a soaring spire
in the Rockies. But the fake wall that opened Oct. 12 offers
climbers a chance to practice most of the basic rock moves.
   And more important, it's close to home.
   ``It's great,'' said Pierre Vaz, one of about 60 climbers who
turned out for opening festivities. ``This is a perfect time for it
to open, because it's starting to get nippy outside.''
   The wall, in a little-used city recreation center on West 59th
Sreet not far from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts,
occupies one end of an old paddleball court.
   Sheets of three-quarter inch plywood are bolted to the
20-foot-high wall in replicas of the shapes climbers seek in
nature: an overhanging cliff face; a narrow chimney; knife-edged
arete, or buttress; a two-foot roof jutting out horizontally.
   Bolted to the wall are knobby holds cast of sand and plastic
resin in a variety of shapes, from easily grasped ``buckets'' to
pockets just big enough to grasp with one finger, to narrow,
sloping edges that offer minimum purchase for fingertips or toes.
   Protected by safety ropes, climbers puzzle out routes to the
top, or move delicately from one side of the wall to the other in
that vertical ballet mountaineers call traversing.
   Installing the wall was more a political feat than a technical
one.
   About 18 months ago, climbers who keep their skills sharp by
working out on boulders in Central Park found the rangers seemed to
be making a special effort to chase them away. Normally a
disorganized lot, they formed a loose alliance called the City
Climbers Club of New York to lobby parks officials to call off the
troops.
   Organizer Ralph Erenzo says he was pleasantly surprised to find
city officials receptive to the new club's overtures.
   They quickly agreed to call off the rangers if the climbers
would agree to avoid a few well-traveled spots.
   Then, when the climbers mentioned they were worried about
twisting their ankles on rocks sticking out of the ground at the
base of their favorite 20-foot cliff, ``Rat Rock,'' the city sent
in a backhoe to clear the ground and laid in a layer of
shock-absorbing wood chips.
   ``The club gave us credibility,'' said Erenzo, 38, who has a
business designing and building exhibits for trade shows. ``It
showed them we weren't a bunch of yahoos.''
   It turned out Erenzo's contact in the parks hierarchy was eager
to encourage off-beat sports. William Castro, the Parks &amp;
Recreation Department's assistant commissioner for recreation,
already had helped organize Frisbee championships, skateboard
contests and BMX bicycle exhibitions.
   And Castro had dabbled with climbing in an Outward Bound-style
confidence-building program the city offers for teen-agers.
   ``There's a thrill from it that I don't think you get in many
organized sports _ you're challenging yourself and seeing what
you're made of,'' Castro said. ``It's a real test of the
individual.''
   When Erenzo started talking about artificial walls, the city's
biggest worry was the risk of someone falling and filing a lawsuit.
   In several months of lobbying, Erenzo showed Castro that
artificial climbing walls are becoming increasingly common and
sophisticated in Europe, and are slowly coming to this country. The
best known is at Snowbird, Utah, where a huge fiberglass scarp was
the site of the International Sport Climbing Championships in
August.
   Erenzo, who has been climbing for a decade and helped judge the
Snowbird contest, worked to convince city officials his sport is
safe if pursued responsibly. The climbers demonstrated how they
hang a rope from the top of a practice cliff, so a partner can
catch a climber who slips from the rock within a foot or two.
   After a slide show by leading French wall designer Jean Marc
Blanche, Castro decided to give the idea a try, and offered the
skylit paddleball court in the underused recreation center.
   Everyone involved realizes the wall isn't accident-proof, but
they've developed a system to lessen the legal risk. Climbers must
sign a form releasing the city from liability and pay a nominal
sign-up fee; they must supply their own ropes and gear; they must
follow safety rules that will be enforced by a parks employee.
   City carpenters built the wall at an estimated cost of $4,000.
The climbers club raised $500 and the American Alpine club chipped
in $500 for the resin-cast holds, which are produced commercially
by several small companies.
   Even as the first climbers tested the feel of the new wall, club
members and officials were talking about expanding the effort. If
the wall proves popular, Castro said others may go up in one or two
other spots around the city.
   And the permits climbers sign to use the wall will also entitle
them to hassle-free climbing at selected rock outcroppings in city
parks _ as long as they display the permit on their ``posterior
aspect.''

death toll raised to 56 from 54.</HEAD>

   The children have returned to school
and a paper Halloween pumpkin hangs at the door, but fitful sleep,
sudden anger and friends on food stamps keep Hurricane Hugo on the
minds of Ben and Kathy Troughton.
   ``The aftermath, to me, has been worse than the hurricane,''
Mrs. Troughton said in an interview last week, a month after the
deadly storm slammed into South Carolina.
   ``The confusion, the sadness and just watching people you know
with everything destroyed, to me, is the worst part.''
   Hugo left some 50,000 people homeless, 18 dead and at least $4
billion damage in South Carolina when it struck Sept 21. By the
time the hurricane faded away in the Northeast, 29 people on the
U.S. mainland and some 56 in the Caribbean were dead.
   Like thousands of others, the Troughtons are trying to cope with
the aftermath of the most expensive hurricane in U.S. history. The
roof of their home must be replaced and the interior repainted to
hide water damage.
   ``Frankly, we feel very guilty because we've had it really so
very easy compared to everybody else,'' Ben Troughton said.
   The night the hurricane came ashore with 135 mph winds, the
Troughtons and their three children huddled in their split-level,
wood-frame home across the harbor from Charleston. The family had
waited too late to leave for an emergency shelter, a decision
Troughton says he has only recently fully considered.
   ``I feel like I took my children's and my wife's lives in
jeopardy by staying here and I would never, ever do that again,''
he said.
   ``I was more scared the night of the hurricane than I ever
was,'' he added. ``I had my three children lying on a mattress on
the kitchen floor because I felt that was the safest place in the
house. And Kathy and I sat there staring at each other for four
hours.''
   Because downed power lines and other dangerous debris littered
the streets after the storm, the Troughtons sent Adam, 11, and
Zachary, 3, to Georgia to stay with relatives. Fifteen-year-old
Scott, a sophomore and football player at Wando High School, stayed
behind to help remove fallen trees.
   ``We paid the Wando offensive and defensive line to come over
and haul off the debris from the front yard,'' said Troughton, who
returned to his job at a rental car agency within a week.
   At first, the Troughtons and their neighbors cooked on gas
grills outside and spent most of their time in their gargages,
which were cooler than their homes with the air conditioning out.
   Troughton says normalcy began to return when electricity was
restored after nine days and the children came home from Georgia.
   Then came Scott's friends _ six or seven a night for three
nights _ staying while their own families tried to find
replacements for their destroyed homes.
   Though generators no longer roar outside powerless homes, Mrs.
Troughton and Scott say sleep is still difficult for them.
   ``You've got so much adrenaline flowing,'' Scott said, ``you're
scared it might happen again.''
   His football games and Adam's soccer games restarted, adding to
the sense of normalcy, but with a twist. Spectators were
``frustrated and tired and angry, and they would let the referee
just have it,'' said Mrs. Troughton.
   She tried to explain contradictory emotions: ``You know that
there's tragedy and you're real, real sorry. But there's that
selfishness inside, that `I've got enough problems of my own.'''
   She described being in the grocery checkout line, though,
shortly after Hugo and having an acquaintance turn to her:
   ``She said, `Have you ever used food stamps? I'm so ashamed.'
It's people like that that you really do feel sorry for, because
it's not only that they need it, their pride is hurt.''

   For some Caribbean islands it will
take years to recover fully from Hurricane Hugo, but most are
quickly bouncing back and starting to rebuild, business analysts
and government officials say.
   ``I think initially we had thought it was going to be much worse
than it's turning out to be,'' said Dorla Humes, a senior economist
for the Barbados-based Caribbean Development Bank, which is
assessing damage on Montserrat, Dominica and the twin island states
of Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts-Nevis.
   Nevertheless, Ms. Humes and others said the widespread
destruction of homes, buildings, hotels, roads and utilities would
set back the economies of the small eastern Caribbean island
nations, which have grown rapidly in recent years on the strength
of a buoyant tourism industry.
   ``Certainly for the rest of this year, and perhaps well into
next year, there is going to be a slowdown in economic activity in
most of the islands affected by the hurricane,'' she said.
   Hurricane Hugo buffeted a dozen islands along a 500-mile arc
from Dominica to Puerto Rico on a two-day sweep of the eastern
Caribbean, Sept. 16-17, before slamming into the South Carolina
coast.
   The storm, which carried winds of 140 mph and heavy rain, killed
an estimated 56 people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S.
mainland, left thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars in
damage.
   In St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, about 1,000 military
police are still on duty and a nighttime curfew remains in effect
even though there have been no disturbances since hundreds of
residents went on a four-day looting spree during and after the
hurricane.
   St. Croix, about 70 miles east of Puerto Rico, was by far the
hardest hit of the three main islands of the U.S. territory.
Federal officials said 6,300 homes in St. Croix, or one-third of
the total, were heavily damaged or destroyed. Power, water and
telephone service still have not been fully restored, and dozens of
plundered stores stand vacant.
   The territorial government has estimated damage on St. Croix and
the two other main islands, St. Thomas and St. John, at $500
million. Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge said he thought it would take at
least two years for St. Croix to fully recover.
   Similarly, Montserrat, a British colony of 12,500 inhabitants
about 200 miles southeast of Puerto Rico, was all but flattened by
the hurricane. Ten people were killed and one-fourth of the
population was left homeless.
   ``You're talking about a rewrite of that country,'' said Melvin
Edwards, a regional coordinator for the Caribbean Association of
Industry and Commerce in Barbados. ``You're going to have basically
a different country in five years.''
   The French island of Guadeloupe, with a population of 340,000,
also was extensively damaged and 15,000 people were left homeless.
   Hundreds of conscript French soldiers are helping repair downed
utility poles, but as of last week, 40 percent of the island
remained without power and 40 percent without telephones.
   Elsewhere, however, power, water and communications have been
restored and reconstruction is well under way, officials say.
   In Puerto Rico, easily the most economically advanced, and with
3.3 million inhabitants, most populous of the islands struck by
Hugo, life has virtually returned to normal except for the extreme
east and the two small offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques.
   Banco Popular, Puerto Rico's largest bank, estimated total
damage at $1.1 billion dollars, including lost production. Chief
economist Augusto Amato said economic growth would probably
constrict this year from a projected 3.4 percent to 3.1 percent.
But he said recovery is occurring so quickly the economy should be
back to normal by the third quarter of next year.
   ``Right now, the economy is recovering very, very fast,
especially in the eastern quarter where most of the manufacturing
is located,'' Amato said. ``We had expected the blow to be more
severe.''
   He said Puerto Rico could expect a ``mini-boom'' in construction
as the island rebuilds with millions of dollars in insurance and
federal disaster assistance filtering through the economy. The Bush
administration has allocated $1.1 billion in disaster assistance
for North and South Carolina, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
   Carl Mitchell, director of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States' Economic Secretariat, based in Antigua, said Hugo was the
most destructive hurricane to hit the eastern Caribbean since the
1920s.
   In the four OECS countries affected _ Montserrat, Dominica, St.
Kitts-Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda _ the hurricane demolished 800
to 1,000 low-income houses and three hospitals and heavily damaged
roads and electrical, water and telephone systems.
   Dominica, the southernmost of the islands affected, escaped
serious property damage, but lost 80 percent of its banana crop,
the impoverished country's main export and foreign-exchange earner,
Mitchell said.
   Substantial damage to citrus crops, livestock, poultry and the
fishing industry also occurred throughout the region.
   But Mitchell said that in most of the islands ``the
emergency-relief phase is virtually over. The help we will be
looking for will be for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of
the economies.''
   The priority now is getting hotels back in shape in time for the
winter tourist season starting in December, he said.
   ``Fortunately, with the exception of Montserrat, tourism has not
been that badly affected by the hurricane,'' Mitchell said.
``Tourism is one of the industries that can rebound most quickly.''

<HEAD>USDA Study Says Boll Weevil Program Profitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new use of old farming practices is
enjoying immense popularity as ``alternative'' agricultural methods
edge further into the limelight.
   Don't forget the boll weevil when these new-fangled farming
methods are brought up. That legendary cotton pest might be an
example of how the good guys can win if old habits are broken and
new methods adopted.
   But first, a little background.
   Called by a number of names _ low input sustainable agriculture,
or LISA, is one _ the concept of alternative agriculture is
attractive to many farmers because it involves cutting production
costs. And that can produce larger profits.
   By whatever name, advocates have been urging alternative
agriculture for years, some wanting to promote the cause of
``organic'' foods, others seeking to improve the environment, still
others who believe farm production costs are far too high.
   Advocates got a big lift from the National Research Council in
its Sept. 7 ``Alternative Agriculture'' report.
   One major recommendation was that federal farm programs should
be changed to encourage the use of less chemicals and to help
farmers get back to the old system of crop rotations and other
sound conservation practices.
   ``Well-managed alternative farming systems nearly always use
less synthetic chemical pesticides, fertilizers and antibiotics per
unit of production than comparable conventional farms,'' the report
said.
   ``Reduced use of these inputs lowers production costs and
lessens agriculture's potential for adverse environmental and
health effects without necessarily decreasing _ and in some cases
increasing _ per acre crop yields and the productivity of livestock
management systems.''
   Now, about the boll weevil's contribution to the environment and
agricultural profitability.
   The boll weevil for generations of cotton farmers has been one
of the dire threats to livelihood. By the late 1920s, the weevil
had spread to the entire Cotton Belt, from the Atlantic to
Brownsville, Texas.
   According to USDA historians, the entire economy of the South
was affected. Farmers, bankers and merchants suffered. Many went
broke, farms were abandoned and tenants moved away.
   The era of DDT and its chemical relatives raised hopes against
the boll weevil and other insect pests. But by 1955 the weevil
joined other insects that had developed resistance to the
chlorinated hydrocarbons such as DDT.
   Gradually, many of the powerful chemicals were banned or phased
out in favor of more effective versions. All were increasingly
expensive to use.
   In 1978, a small-scale cotton boll weevil eradication program
began in parts of North and South Carolina. It was gradually
expanded into all of the two states and eventually into others,
including Virginia, Georgia, Florida and Alabama.
   The department's Economic Research Service recently published a
study on the economic returns from the boll weevil eradication
project in North and South Carolina from 1978 through 1987.
   ``The eradication program yielded an annual rate of return of
187 percent for farmers; 97 percent when all public costs are
included,'' the report said. ``Fewer applications of pesticides
following eradication also benefit the environment.''
   Basically, the cooperative program involved close attention to
insect cycles, tillage methods and timing, targeting chemical
applications properly and the use of many other factors relating to
the pests and local conditions.
   ``The economic benefit from the eradication program flow
primarily from a 69-pound gain in per acre cotton yields and an
annual cost savings of about $30 per acre from using less
pesticides,'' the report said. ``Cotton land gained $14 per acre in
value as farmers switched from less profitable crops.''
   Researchers admitted that the weevil eradication program
benefited from the colder weather of the Carolinas and that the
procedures ``may be less effective in warmer areas such as Georgia
and Alabama.''
   Further, the report cautioned, ``The high rate of return and the
biological success of the eradication program from the Carolinas
can be extended to other regions only with extreme caution.''
   Even within the two states, there were large differences. For
example, pesticide savings were only $6.74 per acre in the North
Carolina piedmont, but were $24.97 per acre in the South Carolina
piedmont.
   Although the weevil study did not address the broader issue of
``alternative'' agriculture, it did highlight a few of the benefits
suggested in the National Research Council's report.
   In its call for more research money, the council's report said
the priorities for an expanded program for competitive research
grants should include an analysis of pest control needs.
   Development of new pest management strategies should be sought
to ``take advantage of cultural practices'' available to farmers,
crop rotations and the use of beneficial insects, parasites and
diseases to control pests, it said. Other biological and genetic
pest controls also should be developed.
   In a way, then, the long war against the boll weevil may be a
model for other efforts. At least it worked in the Carolinas, says
the Agriculture Department.

<HEAD>Jaguar Hopes To Make Less Expensive Car in GM Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC, a British luxury automaker, is looking
to produce a less expensive model appealing to business executives
if plans for cooperation with General Motors Corp. go through, a
Jaguar executive said.
   ``An association with a large company like GM would enable us to
look at the possibility of introducing a smaller Jaguar, an area in
which as a small independent company we cannot consider as the
investment and components-cost would be too high,'' Jaguar's David
Boole said Thursday.
   ``We want to look at other market opportunities and one of those
is a downsized model in the $30,000 to $35,000 range,'' Boole said
in a telephone interview from his home near the Jaguar plant at
Coventry in the English Midlands.
   ``Because we are small we are somewhat constrained in what we
can do,'' Boole added.
   Jaguar cars are known for their sleek lines and high-quality
interior trim. The highest-priced model costs around $64,000.
   Sir John Egan, chairman of Jaguar, said Wednesday at the opening
of the London Motorfair he hoped within one month to present his
stockholders with a plan outlining cooperation with GM.
   The plan would thwart a merger bid by Ford, GM's U.S. domestic
rival, which this week disclosed it has built a stake of 10.4
percent in Jaguar. Egan is set against a merger that would
undermine his rule over one of Britain's most famous companies.
   He told reporters that negotiations with GM, the world's biggest
automaker, could lead to Jaguar receiving a huge cash injection and
guarantee his company's independence.
   British auto industry reporters said Jaguar would probably
propose to its stockholders that Jaguar sell GM a 15 percent stake
in the company in return for about $237 million cash.
   Jaguar currently produces 50,000 cars a year and Egan said the
GM deal would enable Jaguar to invest immediately in new models and
cut spending on components by as much as $950 million a year.
   ``GM has been a supplier for decades of gear boxes to Jaguar,''
said Boole. ``The most important thing for us in an association
with GM would be access to low-cost components and to GM's advanced
research. That would mean developing our current range of cars and
making them more cost effective.''
   Boole said Jaguar would concentrate on ``critical items'' in its
cars like body style, engines and the interior trim _ ``what the
customer sees and touches.''
   He said the company would look to GM for the ``not-so-critical,
out-of-sight background technology'' of wiring harness, axles,
backup systems and air bags _ ``the areas in which a small company
like ours finds it isn't cost effective to spend time and money.''

offers four types of mortgages to persons 62 years of age and older.
   ``To date, Fannie Mae has received more than 3,000 inquiries

President Larry H. Dale.
   Dale said Thursday he association would consider expanding the
project beyond the $100 million commmitment or make the loans
standard mortgage products if lenders experience heavy consumer
demand.
   The mortgages are designed to make it easier for elderly
citizens to obtain housing or maintain their current residence.
They would provide:
   _Accessory apartments, or second, completely private living
units installed in a home.
   _Elderly cottage housing opportunities, which are separate,
self-contained temporary units built on the lot of an existing home
as a residence for a relative.
   _Homesharing by two or more adults.
   _Sale-leaseback, an arrangment in which a home is sold to an
investor and then leased back to the seller.

company and the nation's largest investor in home mortages. It said

   Soo Line Corp. is considering an $82 million
buyout bid from Canadian Pacific Ltd., which already owns 56
percent of Soo Line stock, the two railroads announced Thursday.
   Canadian Pacific would pay $19.50 a share for all outstanding
common stock under the proposal. Soo Line said a special committee
of independent directors would consider the proposal.
   Soo Line stock closed Thursday at $20.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange, up up $2.75 cents a share. The stock's 52-week high was
$26.37{ and its low was $16.75.
   A buyout would be subject to the approval of shareholders
representing at least two-thirds of the 9.5 million shares of
outstanding Soo Line stock, Soo Line spokesman John Bergene said.
Approval also is needed from the Interstate Commerce Commission,
the special independent directors' committee and Soo Line's overall
board of directors, which is controlled by Canadian Pacific.
   ``I guess you would have to characterize it as friendly,''
Bergene said the buyout bid. ``Our relationship with CP has been a
close one for many years.''
   Montreal-based Canadian Pacific has controlled more than 50
percent of Soo Line stock since 1961. Soo Line acquired the
Milwaukee Road in 1985.
   Minneapolis-based Soo Line, the 10th largest rail system in the
United States, operates freight lines in 12 midwestern states. 1988
was Soo Line's first profitable year since 1984. The railroad had
net income of $15.6 million, or $1.64 a share, compared with a loss
of $8.5 million, or a loss of 90 cents a share, in 1987.
   But in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the results of which
were announced Thursday, Soo Line had a net loss of $1.5 million,
or 16 cents a share. That compares with a profit for the same
period last year of $2.9 million, or 31 cents a share.
   For the first nine months of 1989, the railroad lost $398,000,
or 4 cents a share, the company said.
   Canadian Pacific, which earned $820.1 million in fiscal 1988 on
revenues of $12 billion, is a diversified company with holdings in
transportation, waste services, energy, forest products, real
estate and hotels, and telecommunications and manufacturing.
   Graeme McMurray, a Canadian Pacific spokesman in Montreal, said
the proposed buyout ``is the best way to rationalize the
relationship between CP and the Soo and maintain the viability of
the Soo Line.''

   McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc. on
Thursday announced that it has clarified in a letter its $125 per
share offer to purchase 50.3 percent of LIN Broadcasting.
   ``We hope that our prompt, detailed response to the issues
raised by LIN will demonstrate our commitment to providing LIN
shareholders with the opportunity to fully participate in the
growth of the private market value of the company,'' said Craig O.
McCaw, chairman and chief executive of McCaw Cellular.
   ``It is important for shareholders of LIN to recognize that as
majority owners of LIN, our principal objective would be to
maximize the value of all LIN shares _ those held by the public and
those held by us.''
   McCaw on Oct. 10 offered to purchase 22 million LIN shares for
$125 per share cash. That would result in McCaw owning 50.3 percent
of LIN.
   Under the offer, continuing LIN shareholders would be protected
by a private market value guarantee, designed so shareholders could
benefit from further appreciation in the value of cellular assets
and receive a full private market price for their remaining shares
in about five years.
   In its letter, McCaw provided LIN's board of directors with
several clarifications, including that three independent directors
would be designated by the current board; LIN would have a right to
pursue all corporate opportunities to acquire U.S. cellular
interests outside of McCaw interests; and if LIN is put up for sale
in five years rather than purchased by McCaw at appraised private
market value, McCaw will not submit a bid unless the independent
directors request it, and the independent directors will run the
sale process.

   Union Pacific Corp. reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter
profit Thursday, blaming the lower income primarily on refinery

operations that have been spun off to shareholders.
   Discounting the refinery costs, Union Pacific's profits dropped
2 percent, reflecting a softening in the economy, the company said.
   Union Pacific said third-quarter earnings totaled $137.4
million, or $1.35 per share, on revenues of $1.58 billion. For the
same period last year, the company earned $165 million, or $1.44
per share, on revenues of $1.54 billion.
   The refinery operations that have been sold earned $24.9 million
in the third quarter of 1988. Subtracting that income,
third-quarter 1988 earnings were $140.1 million, or $1.23 per share.
   In May, the Bethlehem, Pa.-based company bought about 11,017
shares from stockholders, softening the drop in earnings per share.
   Union Pacific's nine-month earnings totaled $427.7 million, or
$3.98 per share, on revenues of $4.6 billion. For the same period
last year, net income was $456.4 million, or $4 per share, on
revenues of $4.9 billion. The adjusted 1988 figures were $402.7
million in profit or $3.53 per share.
   Fort Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern reported a
third-quarter profit of $72.9 million, or 95 cents a share,
compared with $120.4 million, or $1.60 per share, in 1988's third
quarter.
   Discounting the company's natural resources division, which was
spun off to shareholders at the end of last year, Burlington
Northern earned $66.3 million, or 89 cents per share, in 1988's
third quarter.
   Severe weather, longer hauls and competition contributed to the
earnings decline, the company said.
   Adding to the net income were lower interest rates and a pre-tax
gain of $14.9 million on the sale of a partial interest in Trailer
Train Co., Burlington Northern said.

<HEAD>Trading Goes Well at Pacific Stock Exchange Outposts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Options dealers from the Pacific Stock Exchange may have been
suffering from a bit of jet lag, but they managed to trade
contracts at makeshift posts built with lightening speed at
exchanges in Chicago, Philadelphia and New York.
   ``It went real smooth,'' said Neal Berry, one of roughly 150
traders and support staffers who were shuttled by chartered jet to
exchanges farther East following the Bay Quake that knocked out
power at their own market in San Francisco.
   ``Customers could reach us, we could get (trades) out, though
not as timely as if we were on our own exchange,'' said Berry, who
was working at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
   At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, spokesman Warren Moulds
said there were ``no hitches. Once they got oriented, it was an
easy do.''
   Volume was lighter than the usual 70,000 contracts, but traders
said they expect activity to pick up as they become more familiar
with their surroundings and also because of today's expiration of
October stock options.
   Today is the deadline for investors to renegotiate the options,
which enable them to buy or or sell specific stocks at a specific
price at a certain time.
   The Pacific exchange trades options _ which many investors use
to hedge their stock positions _ in 130 underlying stocks. Among
big-name stocks that have options traded only on the Pacific
exchange are Hilton Hotels Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.
   The Pacific exchange was able to continue stock trading by
rerouting orders through the Los Angeles exchange. But because the
Los Angeles exchange doesn't trade options, officials took the
unprecedented step of relocating the options operation.
   Plans to transport Pacific options trading began forming shortly
after the earthquake hit late Tuesday afternoon local time,
knocking out the electricity. From then on it was an
around-the-clock effort involving a multitude of phone calls among
exchange officials and the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which sanctioned the plan Wednesday.
   At the American and New York stock exchanges, carpenters and
electricians worked through the night erecting trading areas for
the California traders. At the Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
computer experts labored marathon-style laying extra cables and
programming exchange computers to accept new issues.
   The American exchange, like the Big Board, handled hotel
accommodations for traders assigned there.
   In Chicago, where Pacific dealers arrived early enough to begin
trading at the market's 8:30 a.m. CDT opening, maps were handed out
to help them negotiate their way around the 50,000-square-foot
trading floor of the exchange.
   But in New York and Philadelphia, extra time was needed for the
traders to arrive and get settled and trading did not begin until 1
p.m. EDT. Trading was to begin at the normal morning hour today.
   Most of the traders were in good spirits, though Berry said a
house belonging to one of them had collapsed in the disastrous
quake.
   ``Exhausted? That's an understatement,'' said Berry after
trading closed Thursday.
   Exchange officials were no better rested after market events
beginning last Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell
109.58 points _ a drop exceeded only by the Black Monday crash of
1987 _ panicking financial markets around the world.
   ``It's been a bad week,'' said George Kender, executive vice
president of Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp., which processes
all options trades.
   In San Francisco, building inspectors cleared the exchange's
trading floors Thursday, but spokesman Dale Carlson said options
traders would remain where they were through today. Normal trading
was expected to resume Monday in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Group Says Common Practices Not in Consumers' Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next time you write your phone number on a
credit card receipt or obligingly hand over a credit card when
paying by check, think twice, a consumer group says.
   The organization, Bankcard Holders of America, says these common
practices of stores and restaurants may lead to fraud and invasion
of privacy.
   ``Store clerks often pressure consumers into writing their
bankcard numbers on personal checks, but these consumers don't
realize the potential danger in doing so,'' the group's director,
Elgie Holstein, said at a news conference Thursday.
   He contended that ``mail order fraud and application fraud are
increasingly popular crimes, and placing this information (a card's
number and expiration date) on a personal check enables a thief to
make purchases or apply for credit in the customer's name.''
   ``Requiring customers to present a major credit card as
identification, or even noting on the check that the consumer holds
a Visa or MasterCard, can be an appropriate merchant practice,''
Holstein said. ``It is dangerous, however, to require credit card
numbers to be written on checks.''
   To help consumers deal with this practice, the organization is
making available a wallet-sized ``Consumer Action Card'' to present
to merchants who insist on writing credit card numbers on personal
checks. The wallet card alerts merchants that recording this
information encourages fraud and may violate a customer's privacy.
   The bank card-holders group also is concerned that merchants
frequently require consumers to write their phone numbers on credit
card sales slips when processing bank credit card transactions.
   Holstein said this is a violation of consumers' privacy rights.
Also, he said that under Visa and MasterCard operating rules,
merchants cannot refuse a customer's sale just because he or she
refuses to provide personal information on a bankcard sales slip.
   ``Merchants do not need a credit card customer's phone number
since a merchant who correctly processes a bankcard transaction is
relieved of further financial liability by the cardholder's bank,''
Holstein said.
   Bankcard Holders of America describes itself as a national
non-profit consumer education organization.
   A brochure containing the wallet-sized ``Consumer Action Card''
is available for $1.00 from BHA, 460 Spring Park Place, Suite 1000,
Herndon, Va, 22070.
   By coincidence, The Limited Inc. chain of specialty apparel
stores announced later Thursday that its stores would no longer
write credit card numbers on personal checks used for purchases and
would no longer require a customer's phone number on credit card
sales slips.
   But Alfred Dietzel, a Limited spokesman, said the company was
not motivated by concerns about fraud. He said the company is
simply hoping to serve customers more efficiently.
   He said the same-day timing of the announcement was not
intentional.

<TEXT>
   A year ago this week, Ambassador Yuriy
Dubinin led a toast at the Soviet Embassy _ with Soviet champagne _
to a new joint venture between American investors and his
government.
   The idea was to capitalize, in the full sense of the word, on
Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign of perestroika, or economic
restructuring, by introducing Russian products such as that
champagne and beer to American consumers.
   A year later, importer Torg International, as the company was
named, has little to show for itself except difficulties here and
the pitfalls of perestroika.
   Its Englewood Cliffs office closed because of ``internal
problems'' with employees, said company president Dr. George
Carroll, a Florida-based millionaire entrepreneur with a medical
degree. Torg now has a new office in Manhattan.
   Backer Jay Chiat of the advertising agency Chiat-Day-Mojo pulled
out in May, citing frustration with progress in importing goods.
   The public relations firm hired to promote Torg,
Chiat-Day-Mojo-owned Jessica Dee Communications Inc., was dropped
because there was little for it to do, said Carroll.
   Now, Carroll and Soviet emigre Lev Model work alone with help
from consultants. Together they own 51 percent of Torg, one of the
first joint ventures between a U.S. company and the Soviet Union in
this country, Carroll said.
   He would not disclose their investment so far.
   Adding to their difficulties are problems connected with the
Soviet apparatus providing the goods.
   ``I think we were somewhat premature in blowing our horn,'' said
Carroll, speaking in an interview from his Winter Haven, Fla., home.
   ``It was perhaps unrealistic of us to think of things getting
here sooner,'' he said.
   May had been the target date for the venture's mineral water
soft drinks to be introduced, to be followed by a Soviet beer
called Zhiguli.
   But Carroll has not given up, and said Torg _ the Russian word
for trade _ will become active soon.
   A national distributor has been signed up to handle Zhiguli,
pronounced zee-GUH-lee, and should be bringing the brew to market
by year's end, said Carroll. He would not identify the distributor.
   Discussions are continuing with distributors for Soviet
champagne, wine and soft drinks made from mineral water in the
nation's Georgian region, he said.
   ``In the great scheme of life, I don't think we're way behind.''
   Carroll said Torg's efforts have lately centered mainly on
showing products to U.S. distributors. Difficulty in obtaining
samples is just one of the obstacles in Torg's way.
   He said the Soviets are not used to shipping small quantities.
Goods are also backed up at shipping points in that nation.
   Jack Brougher, a U.S. Commerce Department expert on Soviet
trade, said lack of cooperation among Soviet ministries unused to
the joint venture idea may also be holding things up.
   ``Perestroika involves decentralization of the entire foreign
trade machinery,'' added William D. Forrester, president of the
U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council. ``It takes time for the
system to adjust to change. Frankly, I think they are doing
remarkably well.''
   When Torg's formation was announced, there were 110 to 115 joint
ventures with foreign companies in the Soviet Union. About a dozen
involved U.S. interests. Now, says Brougher, Americans are involved
in 90 of about 1,000 registered joint ventures, about 100 of which
are active.
   Of the American joint venturers, the 40-year-old Carroll's
background may make him standout.
   Born in Munich of Soviet emigre parents, Carroll learned Russian
so he could speak to his grandmother. He owns a weight-loss
franchise operation based in Akron, Ohio, and his previous holdings
included a surgical center and medical laboratory.
   ``He seems very suave and sophisticated,'' said someone formerly
involved in Torg who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He's the
kind of person who exudes a lot of charisma.''
   Model has imported small amounts of Soviet products for Russian
communities in the United States for nearly two decades. He and
Carroll met through mutual friends.

<HEAD>FTC Cites Title Insurance Companies For Fee Fixing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission has ruled that
five national title insurance companies illegally fixed title
search fees in six states.
   The FTC found Thursday that the title companies set prices for
title search and examination services by participating in a rating
bureau that pooled data on their policies and claims.
   The agency ordered them to set future rates independently in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona and Montana.
   The FTC had issued a complaint against the companies in 1985.
   Title insurance companies provide two basic services: they
search court records for liens or other restrictions on property
titles, and they provide insurance if there are hidden liens on
property or ownership is in doubt.
   Many firms have been offering both services for a single fee.
The FTC found that federal law exempts insurance, but not
title-searching activities, from antitrust regulations.
   The five title insurance firms ordered to change the way they
set their rates are Ticor Title Insurance Co., Chicago Title
Insurance Co., Safeco Title Insurance Co., Lawyers Title Insurance
Corp. and Stewart Title Guaranty Co.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Listless European Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in listless European trading
at midmorning today. Gold prices were lower in dull dealings.
   Foreign exchange dealers predicted a quiet day for the dollar in
the absence of new economic indicators and after recent volatility
on currency and stock markets.
   ``Technically, the dollar is looking overbought,'' one analyst
in Milan said. ``We'll probably see some corrective action in that
as people reposition themselves before the weekend.''
   A Milan trader said, ``There's very little upside potential,'' a
sentiment echoed by a Frankfurt dealer who said, ``The general
sentiment is still bearish.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 141.35 yen, down 0.20 yen from
Thursday's close of 141.55 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at
a higher rate of 141.76 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.8460 West German marks, down from 1.8525;
1.6180 Swiss francs, down from 1.6225; 6.2702 French francs, down
from 6.2875; 2.0833 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0820; 1,359.25
Italian lire, up from 1,358.50; 1.1742 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1741.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5930 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5940 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $366.90 a troy ounce,
down from late Thursday's $367.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a later recommended price of $366.70
dollars.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $367, down from $368.20 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.49 to close at a bid
$367.40. Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.09 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Thursday.

   Prices continued to climb on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today, while the dollar slipped against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 141.35 yen, down 0.20 yen from Thursday's
close of 141.55 yen. It opened the day higher at 141.93 yen and
then ranged between 141.35 and 142.05 yen.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
112.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 35,486.38. It was the index's
fourth consecutive gain since Monday's plunge of 647.33 points, the
year's largest single drop.
   Dealers said orders from small-lot buyers, relieved at gains
overnight on Wall Street, streamed in continuously during the day.
   The Nikkei index, which rose to 35,611.38 soon after trading
began, lost part of its early gains toward the end of the session
due to profit taking, dealers said.
   Although the trading mood was positive throughout the day,
``Investors, especially dealers, don't want to hold a strong
position over the weekend,'' said a trader at Dai-Ichi Securities.
   Dealers said the index has bounced back steadily since Monday as
stability in the foreign exchange market and on Wall Street have
renewed investor confidence in the stock market.
   The dollar in New York fell earlier due to a
smaller-than-expected increase in the U.S. consumer price index
released Thursday but recovered later as the Dow Jones industrial
average of 30 major issues rose, traders said.
   The United States reported the nation's seasonally adjusted
Consumer Price Index rose by 0.2 percentage point in September.
   The Tokyo market had expected a 0.4-0.5 percentage point rise,
which discouraged dollar buying, a trader with a major Japanese
commercial bank said.
   ``At the same time, however, other market players reassured by
the steady recovery in the New York stock market are inclined to
buy the U.S. currency,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The dollar is likely to get weaker in the long run considering
the current slowdown in the U.S. economy,'' the trader added.
   Dealers said a number of large Japanese institutional investors
were still purchasing dollars, but selling by exporters and
speculators was holding down the U.S. currency.
   Also on Friday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange began option trading in
the Tokyo Stock Price Index for futures issues, in which
shareholders can take market action with a fixed quantity of a
security, or at a fixed price within a specified time to avoid
risks in spot trading.

   British Airways PLC said today it does not plan to

major backer.
   A group of managers and employees of UAL _ the parent of United
Airlines _ has been trying to revise its original $6.75 billion
offer for the carrier after the group failed to line up financing
for the deal.
   The group's announcement last Friday that it could not reach
agreement with banks to finance the buyout was a factor in Wall
Street's Friday the 13th plunge, in which the Dow Jones industrial
average plunged 190 points.
   British Airways, in a brief statement today, said it ``does not
intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in

<HEAD>Qintex Entertainment Files for Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Qintex Entertainment Inc., an
affiliate of the Australian firm facing a $50 million lawsuit
related to its failed attempt to buy MGM-UA Communications Co.,
today said it has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The company also sought Chapter 11 protection Thursday for two
of its subsidiaries, Hal Roach Studios Inc. and Qintex Productions
Inc., the company announced in a news release this morning.
   Company spokesman Daniel Saks, reached at home by telephone,
said the bankruptcy filing was unrelated to Qintex Australia Ltd.'s
failed $1.5 billion MGM-UA acquisition, blaming it instead on the
collapse of a separate Qintex Entertainment $5.9 million loan deal.
   ``Qintex Entertainment was not a party to the merger with MGM-UA
and it was not named in the subsequent lawsuit,'' he said.
   The company also announced that David Evans had resigned as
president and chief executive officer of Qintex Entertainment, but
said he would continue as a full-time consultant until a successor
is selected.
   MGM-UA terminated the $1.5 billion acquisition by Qintex
Australia, which holds 43 percent of Qintex Entertainment's stock,
earlier this month after the company failed to provide MGM-UA with
a required $50 million letter of credit.
   MGM-UA sued Qintex Australia for alleged breach of contract and
fraud, seeking $50 million in damages. The lawsuit was pending in
Los Angeles.
   Qintex Entertainment and Qintex Australia were working with a
lender to secure more than $5.9 million needed for a distribution
agreement with Hal Roach Studios, Saks said.
   But the lender, which Saks refused to identify, declined to
provide the funds, prompting the bankruptcy filing in Los Angeles,
Saks said.
   The $5,945,000 loan was for ``a guarantee payment against MCA's
share of a distribution agreement with Hal Roach Studios,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``It was a long-standing agreement with Hal Roach Studios''
established before the MGM-UA acquisition failed, he said,
declining to elaborate further on the deal.
   At a meeting of Qintex Entertainment's Board of Directors on
Oct. 18, the bankruptcy petition was authorized to offset the loss
of corporate assets, to protect company shareholders and to deal
with creditor's claims, the company said in a prepared statement.
   The company also announced that Roger Kimmel, an independent
director of Qintex Entertainment's nine-member board, had resigned
because he was no longer needed due to the failure of the MGM-UA
acquisition.
   Officials said the company will continue to operate during
Chapter 11 proceedings. Under Chapter 11, companies are protected
from creditors while they work out financial difficulties.

   London stock prices dipped Friday in thin,
featureless trading.
   Sentiment was dented by early weakness in the pound against the
West German mark, and fears that Wall Street might open lower after
its strong gains Thursday.
   The key corporate news of the morning session was that British
Airways PLC has decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for
UAL Corp.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 6.5
points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,182.8 points at midday.
   Volume came to a light 206.9 million shares, compared with 222
million shares at the same time Thursday.
   ``The market's just dawdling at the moment,'' one London dealer
said. ``There are no inspirational factors to buoy it higher.''
   In the absence of bullish factors, traders refocused on
sterling. ``The currency's early weakness washed through to the
equity market,'' a London trader said.

<HEAD>Japan, United States Reach Agreement in Steel Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Japan have agreed to extend
Japanese steel export restrictions for 30 more months, the
government announced Friday.
   Under the revised U.S.-Japan pact, Japanese steel exports to the
United States cannot exceed 5 percent of U.S. annual steel
consumption during the next 15 months, Michinao Takahashi, a
spokesman for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
   During the second 15-month period beginning in January 1991,
Japan's quota will be 5.3 percent of annual U.S. consumption,
Takahashi told a news conference.
   The previous agreement gave Japan a 5.8 percent quota out of the
18.4 percent of the U.S. steel market set aside for foreign steel
producers, but Japan actually exported only 4.2 percent of U.S.
consumption last year, according to Japanese figures.
   The earlier agreement, which expired Sept. 30, was negotiated in
1984 to give U.S. steelmakers breathing space from foreign
competition and allow them to modernize.
   The new agreement prohibits Japan from providing any government
aid to steelmakers for production, export or research, Takahashi
said.
   The agreement comes after several rounds of protracted bilateral
negotiations held in Tokyo and Washington.
   In a short statement, Hikaru Matsunaga, the international trade
and industry minister, described the accord as a ``real answer'' to
the current problems facing steel trade between the United States
and Japan.
   He said Japan would ``continue to make efforts to encourage the
two countries' cooperation and prosperity, while working toward the
healthy development of the world's steel trade ... We strongly hope
that the U.S. steel industry also will make further efforts to make
structural changes and modernize.''
   Friday's agreement follows a statement by U.S. President Bush in
July that Washington was willing to negotiate a 30-month extension
of its general voluntary restraint agreement on steel with its
trading partners.
   In a statement released after the government announcement, Japan
Iron and Steel Federation Chairman Hiroshi Saito said, ``Despite a
decrease in Japan's quota, we think the agreement is acceptable,
considering that Japan is not treated unfairly compared to other
countries, including the 12-member European Economic Community.''
The EEC's share in the U.S. market tumbled from 8 percent to 5.6
percent.
   In a related development Friday, Kobe Steel Ltd., Japan's
fifth-largest steel maker, announced plans to set up a second steel
factory with USX Corp., the largest U.S. steel company, in a 50-50
equity partnership. The agreement is expected to be finalized by
year's end, it said.
   Kobe Steel spokesman Yukinobu Yasuda said the joint factory will
produce hot-dipped galvanized steel sheet somewhere in the U.S.
Midwest, primarily to supply automakers.

   The stock market was mixed today, pausing after
its rally over the past four sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed
113.94 points in the last four trading days, rose another 1.43 to
2,684.63 in the first half hour today.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 421 up, 495
down and 495 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.43 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said optimism about the takeover outlook, after slowly
reviving in recent days, suffered a new setback when British
Airways said it wouldn't take part in any effort to revive a buyout
deal for UAL Corp.
   UAL shares were delayed in opening.
   Brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously as
they waited for the passing of another monthly ``witching hour''
involving the last trading of expiring stock options and stock
index futures contracts.
   At the same time, some observers said the market was still
feeling the positive effects of the government report Thursday that
the consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in September.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Merck rose \ to 77|;
International Business Machines gained ] to 104{; General Electric

value index was up .44 at 383.25.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 39.55 points
to 2,683.20.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 7 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 1,222 up, 342 down and 386 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 198.12 million shares, against 166.90

   Moscow's longstanding commitment to put more
meat on family tables is the compelling reason behind the Soviet
Union's huge orders of U.S. corn, says one of the Agriculture
Department's top Kremlin watchers.
   ``The No. 1 factor is that the Soviets need to increase the
output of livestock products. That is, meat. They can't do it
alone, they've got to import (feed grains),'' said Christian Foster
of the department's Economic Research Service. ``Then, it's the
other factors that determine where they're going to import it
from.''
   During the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the Soviet Union
bought a record 21.7 million metric tons of U.S. grain with an
estimated value of almost $3 billion. That included a record 16.3
million tons of corn and about 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   Since Oct. 1, the Soviets have bought more than 5 million tons
of corn, including 1.2 million tons announced Thursday, plus some
soybeans and soybean meal.
   Foster lists four ``other factors'' that also are influencing
Moscow's decision to buy grain from the United States.
   These include a reduced Soviet harvest of ``coarse'' grains such
as corn and barley in 1988, along with smaller forage crops. Also,
world supplies of coarse grains were tight because of last year's
drought, and prices favored corn over wheat and barley.
   Foster also cites ``improved political ties'' between Moscow and
the United States under Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   But Foster said Thursday in a telephone interview that the
improved political climate ranks ``quite small relative to the
other factors'' that led Moscow to buy so much U.S. grain.
   Economics is important, too, he said. But the Soviets opted for
U.S. corn, with prices competitive with barley from Canada and the
European Economic Community. Additionally, in the 1989 fiscal year,
Moscow bought a significant amount of U.S. grain sorghum for the
time, another important livestock feed grain.
   Overall, he said, the U.S. share of the total coarse grain
market rose to about 70 percent last fiscal year from around 50
percent in 1988. Mostly, that was at the expense of the 12-nation
EEC, which is geographically much closer to the huge Soviet market.
   ``If they're buying grain, economically there must be more
reasons (than price),'' Foster said. ``You would think the (EEC)
would be cheaper because of logistics.''
   Many U.S. export advocates, including recent secretaries of
agriculture, have touted the giant output potential of the American
grain farmer and the reliability of the United States as a supplier.
   The experts have noted for years that the longstanding
commitment by Moscow leaders to boost the livestock sector has been
the underlying reason for importing grain to make up harvest
shortfalls.
   ``It always was a high priority,'' Foster said. ``But it's at
its highest priority ever right now, I would say. Because
Gorbachev, to maintain support _ and the opposition is there _
needs to show some immediate, short-term improvement ... in
consumption patterns, meat products and so forth.''
   Foster said Gorbachev has had so many problems with consumer
goods and food products that ``he just has to regain support if his
reform program is going to make it anywhere.''
   On the matter of world trade, Foster thinks Moscow ``without a
doubt'' would like to be part of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade and is currently extending a few feelers.
   Before Gorbachev, Soviet leaders thought ``the whole thing was
an imperialist whatever,'' he said. ``Since then, they've made it
clear that they're interested but have not pushed it really.''

   Milk prices at the farm are climbing steadily
this season, and the Agriculture Department says that is
translating into higher prices at consumer dairy counters.
   ``Dairy markets are tight because of strong cheese sales,
non-fat dry milk exports, and weakness in milk production,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said Thursday.
   ``However, the size of the price increases largely was
determined by the time of events,'' the report said. ``Milk
production unexpectedly collapsed at midyear, after commitments had
been made for large exports of non-fat dry milk and after
cheesemakers had decided to delay rebuilding of cheese stock until
the flush season'' of higher milk production last spring.
   But analysts said milk output probably will rise above
year-earlier levels in 1990 and that ``seasonal easing'' should
eliminate supply problems.
   ``Dairy prices will drop from this autumn's highs,'' the report
said. ``By next spring, prices may be below a year earlier.''
   The farm price of milk in 1989 may average ``slightly more than
$1 above'' last year's $12.24 per 100 pounds, the report said. In
1990, it may average below the 1988 level.
   ``Retail prices of milk and dairy products were slower to start
rising than farm or wholesale prices. However, the increase in
retail prices will be brisk during the rest of 1989,'' the report
said. ``For the first time in many years, rises in retail dairy
prices will surpass those of all food or all (consumer) items.''

   Farmers have developed conservation plans for
133 million acres of highly erodible cropland, about 98 percent of
the goal, says the Agriculture Department.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said Thursday the goal is to have plans drawn up on all
the eligible land by the Dec. 31 deadline.
   Under the 1985 farm law, farmers must be actively applying a
conservation plan on their highly erodible fields by the beginning
of the 1990 calendar year and have that plan fully implemented by
Dec. 31, 1994, if they want to stay eligible for USDA farm program
benefits.

<HEAD>Drexel To Pay Delaware $50,000 To Settle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will pay
Delaware $50,000 and observe certain restrictions if it decides to
do business in the state again, officials said.
   The New York secuurities firm in September pleaded guilty to six
felonies and began paying $650 million to the government to settle
securities fraud charges stemming from the government's insider
trading investigation.
   The firm said recently it expects to pay $11.5 million overall
to settle with states, avoid litigation and retain its ability to
do business.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the Delaware agreement was
similar to those reached with 25 other states. Drexel this year
sold its retail brokerage business and Anreder said it has no plans
to do business in Delaware.
   The $50,000 payment settles any administrative charges that
would have been brought against the company by the state as a
result of its guilty plea, Attorney General Charles M. Oberlystet
III said Thursday.
   Delaware had the authority to suspend Drexel's operating license.
   ``Some states are taking a harder line, but we considered our
enforcement priorities in making this settlement,'' Hubbard said,
noting that Drexel does not have a Delaware office.
   If Drexel decided to do business in Delaware it would have to
``give us notice and get a law firm to certify that they have a
compliance procedure'' to assure the state that Drexel would obey
state and federal securities laws, Hubbard said.

   _ There were about 3,600 work-related deaths and 5.6 million
occupational injuries and illnesses among 83 million private-sector
employees, a 1986 Bureau of Labor Statistics survey said. One-third
of the injuries and illnesses were in manufacturing, which accounts
for more than 20 percent of the work force.
   _ One of 11 workers will be seriously injured or killed at work,
according to the National Safe Workplace Institute.
   _ A U.S. worker is injured every 16 seconds and one of every six
workers will die from occupation-related diseases, the institute
said.

   DISABILITIES:
   _ Permanent work-related disabilities increased from 60,000 to
70,000 from 1986 to 1987 _ a 16 percent increase, the National
Safety Council said.
   _ However, the rate of disabling work injuries per 1 million
exposure hours dropped from 8.3 to 8.1 in the same period, the
council noted.

   U.S. VS. OTHERS:
   _ The United States had the highest worker fatality rate
compared with six other industrialized nations, the workplace
institute said. Figures compiled by the International Labor Office
showed the industrial accident death rate was 3.6 per 100,000
workers.
   Japan was second-highest with 2.3 deaths, followed by Italy,

said.
   _ They accounted for 38 percent of occupational illnesses in
1987, compared with 28 percent in 1984, according to a Labor
Department survey. Such ailments hit 4 out of every 100 poultry
processing and meatpacking workers in 1987.

   MEATPACKING:
   _ More than a third of packinghouse workers will suffer a
serious illness or injury this year, translating into more than
52,000 workers annually or 200 daily, the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union said.
   _ Between 1981 and 1983, meatpacking production jumped by 52
percent, the union said, while employment declined by almost 20
percent.

<HEAD>No Quake Fissures in Huge California Muni Bond Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's municipal bond market, the nation's
largest, felt barely a ripple from the earthquake last week, though
some of the roads, bridges and buildings financed by the bonds
sustained damage.
   Prices of the bonds were virtually unaffected by the quake.
Mutual fund operators said they received few panicky calls from
investors in California-based municipal bond funds, and almost none
of the investors pulled out.
   One reason for the complacency is that precautions for an
earthquake were built into most of the bonds. Another less
reassuring reason is that information about the extent of quake
damage to facilities built by the bonds was sketchy.
   Bond experts expect few problems with California municipal bond
issuers making interest payments in the short term.
   However, over a longer period of time, there could be defaults
when reserve funds or insurance policies designed to make
short-term payments in such an emergency run out, experts said last
week.
   ``We don't really know the extent of all the damage that has
taken place. It's not inconceivable that there could be
interruptions in even some of the tax-supported debt,'' said Peter
Schmitt, chief operating officer of Financial Guarantee Insurance
Co., a bond insurance firm.
   Among the bond issues most at risk, experts said, are ones sold
by small municipalities to pay for non-essential facilities, such
as secondary hospitals, that may not be rebuilt if found damaged.
   Also at risk are bonds that financed port facilities. If any
were damaged extensively, there's a chance the operators may not
rebuild since there is strong competition from more modern ports in
the Northwest, Schmitt said.
   A third area of concern are the so-called tax increment
districts in California. These districts were established to
promote industrial development, and taxes from the new industry go
to pay off bonds that were sold to build highways and other
infrastructure improvements in the areas.
   If any of these areas were damaged by the quake, there's no
guarantee the industries would rebuild, which means the revenue to
pay off the bonds could drop, said Hyman C. Grossman, a managing
director at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a credit-rating agency.
   About 30 percent of California municipal bonds issued so far
this year carry bond insurance that guarantees interest and
principal payments will be made for the life of the bond, Schmitt
said.
   Of the remainder, many contain other provisions to ensure
payments, such as earthquake insurance on facilities funded by the
bonds, short-term work-stoppage insurance contracts, and a reserve
fund equal to one year's interest payments, he said.
   Another protection in some issues involves the combination of
several revenue sources to ensure that if one facility built by
bonds is damaged, related facilities would continue providing
revenue.
   For example, Grossman said, though the Bay Bridge was seriously
damaged by the quake, revenue from other toll bridges in the area
is tied into the same revenue stream and should provide enough
money to make payments on the bonds that built the bridges.
   But not all municipal bonds carry such protections. ``By process
of deduction there probably are some bonds out there that will have
some interruption of payment,'' Schmitt said.
   Grossman said he was more concerned with the longer-term
economic disruptions the quake may have caused. If residents aren't
spending as much money due to highway damage, for example, local
sales tax revenue could drop, lowering the ability of
municipalities to make bond payments.
   But another effect may be that sales tax revenue will jump when
people start buying construction materials and other goods to
rebuild, he said.
   Investors appeared unfazed by the quake. Though there were
isolated bond issues from the quake area that declined in value
last week, most California municipal bond prices moved with the
municipal market as a whole.
   Franklin Resources Inc., operator of the nation's largest mutual
fund composed entirely of California municipal bonds, said it
received few calls from investors concerned about the fund's fate.
   One reason could be that phone lines into the company's San
Mateo, Calif., headquarters were affected by the quake, said
Charles Johnson, Franklin's marketing director. But he said he
believed the main reason was that investors realized the
diversified, $9 billion fund would not be affected, since it is
composed of bond issues from throughout the state.
   Officials of Putnam and Dreyfus Corp., two other mutual fund
operators, also reported few investor inquiries about their
California muni funds.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Weaken Slightly After Soviet Corn Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade as corn
traders followed the old market adage, ``Buy the rumor, sell the
fact.''
   An Agriculture Department announcement late Thursday that the
Soviet Union had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn
confirmed rumors of a Soviet corn deal that had strongly supported
the grain markets in Thursday's trading session.
   Thursday's speculation about the size of the sale had ranged as
high as 2 million metric tons.
   Increased foreign demand for U.S. grains and soybeans has been a
key factor in this week's across-the-board gains. But the higher
prices have encouraged farmers to sell more of their grain, and
that was another reason for today's early decline.
   Forecasts for improved harvesting weather in the Midwest next
week also discouraged buying of futures this morning.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.06{ a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$2.42{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower across the board with
December at $1.45{ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 1 cent
higher with November at $5.63\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in cautious trading ahead of this
afternoon's quarterly USDA cattle-on-feed report.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .37 cent lower with October at
74.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower
with October at 82.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .40
cent lower with October at 48.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .03 cent to .35 cent lower with February at 51.77 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc.'s earnings rose 49 percent
in the latest quarter, mainly because of a gain from the sale of
its stock in Adobe Systems Inc., the company said Friday.
   Operating income before the Adobe gain and taxes and interest
rose a narrower 2 percent.
   Apple Chairman John Sculley said the company was recovering from
a squeeze on profit margins caused by high component costs. Apple
was faulted for buying large quantities of computer chips at
unusually high prices during a temporary shortage last year.
   Earnings in Apple's fourth quarter rose to $161.1 million, or
$1.24 a share, including an after-tax gain of $48 million from the
Adobe sale. That was up from $107.9 million, or 84 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.38 billion from $1.17 billion.
   For the full fiscal year, Apple's earnings rose to $454 million,
or $3.53 a share, from $400.3 million, or $3.08 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $5.28 billion from $4.07 billion.

   Like the earthquake that jolted Northern
California, the U.S. stock market's big drop sent a tremor through
the global financial system last week.
   The sudden plunge didn't appear to do lasting damage, but it did
show Wall Street as an unstable bellwether for the world's equity
markets. Its foundations look all the more creaky compared with the
Tokyo stock market, the world's biggest and richest. Tokyo slipped
modestly after New York's plunge but quickly recovered and ended
last week on its customary note _ higher.
   That performance is convincing many analysts that far from being
a bubble about to burst, Japan's stock market _ like its economy _
is a bedrock of stability that's a growing influence on world
markets.
   ``The Tokyo market, despite the fact that we've all been saying
that it's overpriced and it's gone up too much, performs when the
chips are down,'' said Barton Biggs, chief investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and chairman of the firm's asset management
arm.
   The chips have been down in a big way twice in the past two
years, and each time Japan has led the world's equity markets back
from the brink.
   Before Black Monday wiped out nearly a quarter of this country's
stock market values on Oct. 19, 1987, many analysts regarded Tokyo
as the global markets' weak link. Share prices in relation to
earnings were at least three times as high as in New York and
Europe, seemingly unsustainable heights.
   But Tokyo not only didn't trigger the crash, its decline was the
smallest of any major stock market, and Japanese stocks regained
their pre-crash levels months before any others. The Japanese
market did it again last week as the Nikkei index erased Monday's
1.8 percent decline in just two days while other markets, including
New York, curbed losses but remained down.
   ``It's certainly a safer place,'' says Rudiger Dornbusch, an
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``I think
the Japanese know better how to manage their economy and their
markets. We make a culture out of financial vulnerability and
volatility.''
   Dornbusch blames much of Wall Street's whipsaw action on
investor demands for instant returns _ buying a stock in hopes of
selling it at a higher price within days or weeks, perhaps amid
takeover fever, rather than looking at a company's long-term
earning potential.
   That tendency ``really goes right to the heart of problems of
American competitiveness and manufacturing performance,'' he says,
especially vs. Japan. ``Our horizon is lunchtime. Theirs is 10
years.''
   Japan also has money on its side, says Robert Brusca, chief
economist at Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. The
cash generated by Japan's seemingly limitless exports of cars,
stereos and computer chips gives the Tokyo market a strength that
New York cannot match because of the big U.S. trade deficit.
   ``The United States has the potentially fragile market because
we are the ones that are relying on continuous inflows of capital
from abroad,'' he contends.
   Japan's buoyant economy adds an ``inherently stabilizing
feature'' to the market, says Geoffrey Dennis, economist with James
Capel &amp; Co. in New York. Japan adjusted quickly to the sharp rise
in the yen in 1986 and 1987 by relying more on domestic demand for
growth rather than exports.
   Peter Davies, assistant vice president at Nomura Securities
International Inc. in New York, said the firm's research arm
forecasts Japan's economy will grow 4.8 percent this year and 4.4
percent in 1990, compared with 2.9 percent and 1.8 percent,
respectively, for the United States.
   All those economic strengths haven't enabled Tokyo to replace
New York as the leading influence on world equity markets, however.
Indeed, notwithstanding Tokyo's relatively modest decline last
Monday, European markets plummeted initially and rallied only when
New York rebounded.
   In part, European traders ignored Tokyo's calmer reaction
because it was expected, says Tim O'Dell, international market
strategist at Phillips &amp; Drew in London. Unlike regulatory
authorities in the United States and Europe, Japanese authorities
can put pressure on the country's securities firms, banks,
insurance companies and pension funds to avoid a selloff.
   Tokyo's sky high prices also aren't seen as relevant to New
York, London or Frankfurt, where dividend income plays a bigger
role in valuing stocks. Japanese shares are trading at prices that
are nearly 60 times annual earnings, compared with multiples of
about 13 in New York and 12 in London and Frankfurt.
   What's more, European stock markets historically have moved more
closely in step with Wall Street than with Tokyo, says Davies.
   All of which creates a kind of ``Mars effect'' that sets Japan
apart from other financial centers, Nikko's Brusca says. ``The
Tokyo market sets the same kind of precedent that events on Mars do
for everyone else.''
   So Tokyo may not be a bellwether, but its ability to withstand
the turbulence emanating from New York makes it an attractive play
for investors looking to diversify, says O'Dell.
   ``It is not like Wall Street and London,'' he says. ``It
actually does reduce risk.''
   Morgan Stanley's Biggs said that fact should help Tokyo, which
represents about 40 percent of the world's stock market by value,
to garner a bigger share of global investment funds compared with
New York, which accounts for about 33 percent of world equities.
   ``You'd have to say that capital is going to tend to flow
towards the stable environment rather than the unstable one.''

   The stock market gave ground today, pausing
after its rally over the past four sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed
113.94 points in the last four trading days, dropped 8.20 to

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 467 up, 844 down and

reviving in recent days, suffered a new setback when British

   UAL shares, which traded as high as 294 before buyout plans for
the company ran into trouble, tumbled 25[ to 165.
   Brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously as
they waited for the passing of another monthly ``witching hour''

index futures contracts.
   At the same time, some observers said the market was still
feeling the positive effects of the government report Thursday that

index was down .44 at 382.37.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 80.39 million shares at

<HEAD>McCaw Receives $1.2 Billion in Financing Commitments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said
Friday it has received commitments from three banks to provide $1.2
billion in financing for its $2.75 billion offer for a majority
interest in LIN Broadcasting Corp.
   LIN has taken no position on the offer, and is already committed
to a separate deal in which it plans to merge its cellular
operations with those of BellSouth Corp., the regional telephone
company based in Atlanta.
   A takeover of the New York-based LIN would extend McCaw's
position as the largest company in the cellular telephone business.
   McCaw said Morgan Guaranty Trust, Provident National Bank and
The Toronto-Dominion Bank, which are jointly serving as agent banks
on McCaw's behalf, have committed $1.2 billion in financing for the
LIN deal, subject to customary conditions.
   In addition, it said the banks are highly confident that they
can get commitments within the next several weeks from other
foreign and domestic banks for the balance of $4.5 billion in
financing needed for the deal.
   McCaw is trying to get more financing in place than would be
needed simply to complete its $125 a share offer for 22 million
shares of LIN stock.
   That is because McCaw has offered an additional $1.9 billion for
a half interest in Metromedia Co.'s New York City cellular
franchise. LIN owns the other half of the franchise and has the
right to match McCaw's offer.
   On Thursday, McCaw said it had provided clarification requested
by LIN's board about terms of its Oct. 10 offer for 22 million of
LIN's shares. Combined with the 5.1 million LIN shares McCaw
already owns, acquisition of the shares would boost McCaw's stake
to about 50.3 percent of LIN's 53.9 million shares.
   ``We hope that our prompt, detailed response to the issues
raised by LIN will demonstrate our commitment to providing LIN
shareholders with the opportunity to fully participate in the
growth of the private market value of the company,'' said Craig O.
McCaw, chairman and chief executive of McCaw Cellular.
   ``It is important for shareholders of LIN to recognize that as
majority owners of LIN, our principal objective would be to
maximize the value of all LIN shares _ those held by the public and
those held by us.''
   Under the offer, McCaw said it would begin an auction process in
July 1994 that would buy out the remaining shares at a price
roughly equivalent to what a third party may have paid for all of
LIN.
   McCaw said that feature enables LIN shareholders to benefit from
further appreciation in the value of cellular assets and receive a
full private market price for their remaining shares in about five
years.
   LIN's board earlier this week declined to take a position on the
new offer from McCaw and requested clarification of its terms. A
spokeswoman for LIN said Friday that the company had no comment as
yet on the McCaw letter.
   In its letter, McCaw affirmed that LIN would have a right to
pursue all corporate opportunities to acquire U.S. cellular
interests outside of McCaw interests after the deal. It also said
if LIN is put up for sale in five years rather than purchased by
McCaw at appraised private market value, McCaw will not submit a
bid unless the independent directors request it, and the
independent directors will run the sale process.
   LIN previously rejected as inadequate a McCaw offer of $110 a
share for all of its stock, and subsequently agreed on a deal with
BellSouth to merge their cellular operations.
   BellSouth has not yet indicated what its repsonse to the new
offer from McCaw for LIN will be.
   Alluding to the deal with BellSouth, McCaw said, ``We trust that
LIN will take no further actions that favor BellSouth, but rather
will conduct a fair auction of the company on a level playing
field.''

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB said Friday
they were calling off talks analysts said might have been aimed at
developing a European truck operation for Ford.
   The companies said in a joint statement that the discussions
were friendly but produced no agreement ``that could make long-term
business sense for both parties.''
   Though it was rumored that Saab had sought a buyer to help its
troubled passenger car division, the companies themselves said only
that they were discussing possible cooperation in various areas.
   Ford already is a strong seller of cars in Europe but lacks a
widespread medium- and heavy-duty truck operation there, leading
U.S. analysts to pinpoint Saab's Scania truck division as Ford's
probable target.
   ``There are a number of things that we discussed with Saab, but
both companies signed a confidentiality agreement on the subjects
we were discussing and that will remain in force,'' Ford spokesman
Bert Serre said.
   The discussions went on for several months, he said, though he
wouldn't say how often meetings were held or who took part.
   Ford has its own Swedish operation, Ford Motor Co. AB, founded
in Stockholm in 1924 to market Ford products in that country.
   Ford announced Sept. 19 that it intended to acquire a 15 percent
share of British luxury automaker Jaguar PLC, and said Monday its
share had reached 10.9 percent. Serre wouldn't comment on whether
Ford's holdings remained at that level Friday.
   He did say Ford considered the Jaguar and Saab talks separate,
and progress of the Jaguar move didn't lead to the end of
discussions with Saab.

   The dollar made small gains in Europe Friday as
the market's recent interest in stocks started to fade and
attention refocused on U.S. economic fundamentals.
   Dealers reported that the shift in focus encouraged some
investors who had been betting on a weaker dollar to cover their
short positions, which had the effect of driving the dollar higher.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 141.35 yen, down 0.20 yen from
Thursday's close of 141.55 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at
142.30 yen.
   The British pound sold for $1.5885 in London, down from $1.5940
late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates late Friday in Europe compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.8535 West German marks, up from
1.8525; 1.6255 Swiss francs, up from 1.6225; 6.2962 French francs,

   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $1.49 to close at a bid price of

   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.09 a troy

   Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on
the moon, is joining the board of directors of Thiokol Corp., whose
rocket was blamed in the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger.
   Armstrong and several other directors were elected Thursday in
the first shareholders' meeting of the company since the separation
of Morton Thiokol Inc. into Thiokol and Morton International Inc.
in July.
   The explosion of Challenger was blamed on a faulty O-ring seal
on one of the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets, which were
built by Morton Thiokol. Seven astronauts died in the explosion.
   Thiokol was involved in the redesign of the rockets and since
the redesign there have been six successful missions, U. Edwin
Garrison, chief executive officer of the company, told shareholders.
   Garrison said in his annual report that Thiokol has 40 percent
of the solid rocket propulsion market in the United States.
   Thiokol operates a sprawling solid-fuel rocket production and
testing facility about 40 miles northwest of Ogden, the company's
headquarters.
   ``Thiokol is well-positioned for the future with a backlog of $4
billion in work,'' Garrison said.
   Thursday's meeting was conducted under tight security.

   Pioneer Electronics Corp. of Japan has
agreed to buy a laser disc pioneer, Discovision Associates, for
$200 million.
   The deal to sell Discovision was announced Thursday by its
co-owners, International Business Machines Corp. and MCA Inc.
   Discovision began researching and making laser video disks in
the 1960s and holds more than 1,400 patents and patent applications
at the heart of compact disc player, video disc player and related
technologies. Discovision no longer manufactures anything, and the
patents are its sole assets.
   Discovision President James N. Fiedler said the company was not
seeking a buyer, but that Pioneer ``offered a price we were not
prepared to refuse.''
   Pioneer, the leading seller of optical disc systems in the
United States, appears to have achieved a major coup over its Dutch
rival, NV Philips, said Linda Helgerson, editor of CD Data Report,
a newsletter based in Falls Church, Va.
   She noted that while Philips is credited with inventing many of
the basic laser disc technologies, the company agreed last year to
pay a ``significant sum'' to license technologies from Discovision.
   All the world's major manufacturers of laser disc systems,
including Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., are licensees of Discovision.

   The prospect of another record world cocoa crop
this season points to further downward pressure on prices, which
are already at their lowest in 14 years, a leading international
cocoa merchant said Friday.
   In its first forecast for the year beginning this month, Gill
and Duffus Ltd. put production at 2.386 million metric tons,
231,000 tons in excess of consumption.
   This would be the sixth consecutive season of overproduction,
lifting world stocks to a record high of 1.305 million tons and
exacerbating current storage problems, the company said.
   ``The analysis of supply-demand fundamentals points to further
downward pressure over the next 12 months,'' it added.
   Cocoa prices, once adjusted for inflation, are at their lowest
level of the post-World War II period, severely damaging the
economies of the Ivory Coast, Ghana and other exporting countries
that rely on the export of beans for foreign exchange earnings,
analysts said.
   Stocks are already at their highest level ever, following the
estimated addition of a record 314,000 tons last season, when
production rose by 198,000 tons to 2.375 million tons, according
Gill and Duffus's estimates.
   It put the 1988-89 harvest in the Ivory Coast at 810,000 tons,
the biggest ever and 145,000 above 1987-88.
   Ghana's crop rose to 305,000 tons last season from 188,000,
Nigeria's to 160,000 from 150,000 and Indonesia's to a record
65,000 from 49,000, while Brazil recorded a fall to 333,000 from
342,000 and Malaysia to 220,000 from a record 222,000 in 1987-88.
   The company's crop estimates for 1989-90 include the Ivory Coast
730,000 tons, Brazil 345,000, Ghana 330,000, Malaysia 255,000,
Nigeria 185,000, Cameroon 110,000, Indonesia 85,000, Ecuador
75,000, Colombia 52,000, Mexico 45,000 and Papua New Guinea 38,000
tons.
   International talks here last month on a producer-consumer deal
to support the market ended in failure and no further meetings on
the issue are currently scheduled.

   British Airways PLC's decision Friday to pull out
of a group attempting to buy UAL Corp. probably won't hurt the
carrier's international marketing strategy and could be a benefit
in the short-term, analysts said.
   The British flag carrier announced Friday it was pulling out of
the group led by UAL management and pilots that has been struggling
to resurrect a buyout offer for the company, parent of the second
largest U.S. airline.
   The group's Oct. 13 announcement that it had failed to line up
bank financing for its original $6.75 billion buyout plan helped
spark the second-worst U.S. stock market plunge ever.
   Since then, the group has been trying to get support for a
revised proposal at a lower price, about $5.62 billion.
   Under the original buyout agreement, British Airways would have
provided $750 million, or about three-quarters of the needed
capital for the takeover, and received a 15 percent stake in UAL.
   British Airways in a brief statement Friday morning said it
``does not intend to participate in any new deal for the
acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future.''
   The company would not comment on its reasons for the decision.
However, the statement noted that British Airways' two-year-old
marketing agreement with United Airlines would remain in effect,
and there is no change in the company's strategic objectives of
seeking marketing alliances and partnerships with other airlines.''
   European airlines have been scrambling to link up with each
other and with American and Asian airlines to form mega-carriers
better equipped to compete in the increasingly global and
competitive air travel industry.
   Analysts said the British Airways decision likely was a death
knell for the UAL buyout. But they also speculated the British
carrier might participate in a future buyout plan or other hookup
with another airline.
   ``British Airways still ultimately would like to have a greater
presence in the U.S. and Pacific markets,'' said Andy Chambers, an
analyst with Nomura Securities in London.
   The analysts said they weren't surprised by British Airways'
decision.
   The withdrawal ``would be regarded as fairly positive in the
short-term,'' Chambers said. ``It's actually going to enhance their
cash flow in the immediate future.''
   ``Personally, I welcome it,'' said Nick Cunningham, an airlines
analyst with the London investment firm Laing and Cruickshank. ``I
don't think they needed to do this deal. I think they were worried
that some other European airline would take a stake. That's now
less likely.''
   Cunningham cited the U.S. Department of Transportation's recent
decision to force KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to reduce its planned
stake in Northwest Airlines. KLM was part of an investor group that
acquired Northwest parent NWA Inc. earlier this year for $3.65
billion.
   Even though KLM's proposed holding was under the 25 percent
limit the U.S. government imposes on foreign stakes in American
airlines, the Transportation Department decided the size of KLM's
investment would give it too much influence.
   ``I think that's why British Airways feels pretty safe pulling
out. They can always come back if another European airline steps
in,'' Cunningham said.
   If British Airways really wanted a 15 percent stake in United
Airlines, it could buy it in the open market at a much cheaper
price, he said.
   British Airways' shares fell the equivalent of 2 cents to close
at $3.13 a share Friday on London's Stock Exchange.

   Integrated Resources Inc. said Friday it has
resumed negotiations with an unnamed party to buy its core
financial services in an attempt to raise money to help pay off
$1.75 billion in debt.
   Integrated had said Tuesday that the talks had ended. It said
then that a group of its senior executives was considering making
an offer.
   The struggling investment concern, which defaulted on debt
payments in June, had been negotiating to sell key assets to raise
money to pay some of its outstanding debt and avoid a bankruptcy
filing.
   Integrated's main financial businesses are Integrated Resources
Equity Corp. of Englewood, Colo., its principal broker-dealer
subsidiary; Resources Trust Co.; and Integrated Resources Asset
Management Corp., an investment adviser.
   The firm also is seeking to sell two of its life insurance
companies, Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines,
Iowa, and Capitol Life Insurance Co. of Denver.
   Negotiations for the businesses came after a $310 million deal
with Whitehall Financial Group fell through. Whitehall cited
worsening conditions in the debt markets amd concerns over the
value of the businesses.
   Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to bondholders
since June, when it said it would have to default because of
troubles stemming from its difficulty in diversifying out of real
estate into financial services.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing
today, pausing after its rally over the past four sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed
113.94 points in the last four trading days, added another 2.66 to

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 595 up, 844 down and
490 unchanged.
   Analysts said optimism about the takeover outlook, after slowly
reviving in recent days, suffered a new setback when British

deal for UAL Corp.
   UAL shares, which traded as high as 294 before buyout plans for

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting pre-weekend
profit-taking after a week of substantial gains in the corn and
soybean markets.
   Forecasts for improved harvest weather next week also put
pressure on crop prices, analysts said. The wintry weather that
blasted the Midwest this week slowed the harvest and contributed to
the corn and soybean rally.
   Friday's losses were limited by expectations that the
Agriculture Department will confirm further corn sales to the
Soviet Union. The Soviet purchase of 1.2 million metric tons that
was announced Thursday fell short of the 2 million tons that
traders had expected.
   Rumors persisted that the Soviet Union was seeking to buy U.S.

<HEAD>Corporate Parent Hasbro Has High Hopes for Cabbage Patch Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cabbage Patch Kids, the cuddly dolls that
once were a toy industry sensation, could be headed for a comeback
thanks to a hard-sell campaign that new parent Hasbro Inc. is
aiming at customers' soft spots.
   ``Hasbro is going back to the basics _ the love,'' said Xavier
Roberts, creator of the dolls that were so popular they caused
near-riots in toy stores in the mid-1980s.
   The Cabbage Patch craze wilted when Coleco Industries Inc.,
which formerly owned the rights to the dolls, moved away from the
theme of love and caring and treated the dolls like any other toy,
Roberts, said this week.
   ``In the past couple of years, under all Coleco's stress and
strain, it got away from the concept,'' Roberts said.
   Last month, two months into its contract with Roberts' Original
Appalachian Artworks, Hasbro launched a $7 million television
advertising campaign for Christmas that reintroduces the doll's
original marketing concept.
   ``It really talks about the whole adoption process and all the
warm feelings,'' said Wayne Charness, a Hasbro spokesman.
   A Cabbage Patch Kid comes with a birth certificate that gives
the doll's name, family history, footprints and thumbprints. A
mail-in adoption certificate is available if the child promises
``to love my Cabbage Patch Kid with all my heart.''
   A desire to inherit the Cabbage Patch Kids was a major reason
why Hasbro, the country's largest toymaker, bought some of the
assets of Coleco, a Connecticut-based toy maker in Chapter 11
bankruptcy-court proceedings.
   Hasbro had passed up a chance to buy rights to Cabbage Patch in
the early 1980s only to watch the homely, stuffed dolls become an
improbable megahit.
   Coleco earned wealth and renown from the dolls in the mid-1980s.
But as Cabbage Patch fever died down, toy analysts said Coleco
became one more company to be sideswiped by the fads that
periodically sweep through the industry and then fade.
   Analysts also said Coleco relied too heavily on Cabbage Patch.
Under Hasbro, the dolls will join such proven heavy-hitters as
veteran action figure G.I. Joe and My Little Pony.
   In their heyday, Cabbage Patch dolls had $600 million in
wholesale sales in 1985. Sales were approximately $60 million last
year.
   ``For the past two years with Coleco's problems, there was no
advertising,'' Charness said.
   Hasbro President Larry Bernstein noted, ``There's a whole
generation of kids 7 years old on down who don't even know about
the original concept.''
   Charness would not reveal estimates but said early reports
showed strong retail sales.
   ``I firmly belive Cabbage can be back up there,'' said Roberts.
   He said the best chances for long-term growth will come when
children who grew up with the dolls become adults and buy them for
their own children.
   Laurie Lively, a toy analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said Cabbage
Patch won't be able to break its sales record because it no longer
is the novelty item that had parents crowding store aisles a few
years ago. The dolls sell for between $15 and $40.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised at all if it achieved $100 million or
even $150 million, but $600 million seems like a stretch,'' she
said.
   Roberts, 33, an artist, created the doll in 1978 as a form of
soft sculpture for adults. The first dolls were modeled after real
children.
   ``I never really considered it a toy,'' said Roberts, who gets
an undisclosed royalty under the licensing agreement. ``I intended
it for adults. I saw it as a new art form.''
   In 1983, he reached an agreement with Coleco that called for the
mass-produced dolls to each have slight differences in hair, eyes,
freckles and dimples.
   Some dolls, the Original Cabbage Patch Kids, still are hand-made
by about a dozen artists at the former Cleveland, Ga., hospital
where Roberts moved his studio and where he got the idea to have
children adopt the dolls.
   The hand-made versions sell for $150 to $1,000.
   ``It has proven the test of time that it's a stayer,'' said
Hasbro's Charness. ``It has proven it will be charming little boys
and little girls for years to come.''

<HEAD>Travelers Loses Key Case in Appeals Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ruled against
Travelers Corp., saying the Hartford-based insurer and not its
policyholder should pay for legal costs associated with a pollution
case.
   The case stems from Travelers' refusal to represent Avondale
Industries Inc. of New Orleans in a Louisiana state proceeding
involving pollution at an Avondale oil recycling plant.
   Louisiana told Avondale in 1986 it was potentially liable for
cleanup costs at the plant. Avondale asked Travelers to defend it
in a state proceeding, but Travelers failed to respond.
   Travelers has contended that government proceedings informing a
company that it might be responsible for cleanup are technically
not lawsuits and thus are not covered by policies.
   Travelers also claimed, as have other insurance companies, that
cleanup costs do not constitute damages within the meaning of
comprehensive general coverage.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled on
Wednesday, however, that Travelers was obligated to defend Avondale
in the state proceedings.
   ``We think that an ordinary businessman reading this policy
would have beleived himself covered by the demands and potential
damage claims,'' the court said in its decision.
   State and federal courts have been divided on whether commercial
general-liability policies cover cleanup costs under federal law.
   Kenneth Abraham, a professor of environmental law at the
University of Virginia, said Thursday the ruling was important
because many policies are issued out of New York. He said the
ruling reverses a recent string of victories by insurance companies.
   Travelers attorney Mary Kay Vyskocil of New York said the
insurer will appeal.

   Texas Instruments Inc.'s third-quarter earnings
fell 30.6 percent, the company said Friday, blaming the decline on
a sluggish domestic electronics industry, especially in computers
and defense.
   Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $65 million, or 67
cents per share, compared to $93.7 million, or $1.03 per share, in
the same period last year. Third-quarter income includes $28
million in royalties, up from $21 million last year. Net sales
billed declined to $1.54 billion from $1.58 billion.
   Chairman Jerry R. Junkins said weakening demand in the United
States and moderation in Japan and the Pacific Rim offset strong
demand in Europe.
   ``In response to conditions in these electronic equipment
markets, the growth rate of the world semiconductor market
continues to slow, particularly for memory products,'' Junkins said.
   For the first nine months of the year, Texas Instruments said
income had declined to $255.8 million, or $2.70 per share, from
$271 million, or $3.01 per share last year. The company earned $125
million from royalties, compared to $98 million last year.
   Net sales billed increased slightly to $4.66 billion from $4.60
billion.

<HEAD>Warner Bros. Takes Further Legal Action Against Sony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Bros. has stepped up its efforts to
prevent Sony Corp. from hiring producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters
to head the entertainment company Sony plans to acquire, Columbia
Pictures.
   A motion for a preliminary injunction, filed Thursday in Los
Angeles Superior Court, asks a judge to bar Sony from hiring the
``Batman'' producers, who are trying to get out of a five-year
contract they signed with Warner earlier this year.
   The action follows a $1 billion lawsuit filed last week by
Warner against Sony, and a $100 million countersuit Sony filed
against Warner.
   Terry Christensen, an attorney for Guber and Peters, said he
believed Warner filed the suit for publicity and bargaining
purposes.
   ``I don't think it's real,'' Christensen said. ``It's a further
attempt to hammer Sony.''
   The producers contend they had a verbal agreement with Warner
that they would be allowed out of their contract if a chance to run
a big studio came along. But in affidavits filed Thursday, top
Warner executives denied that was true.
   The motion for an injunction also is meant to allow Guber and
Peters to keep working for Warner while the opposing lawsuits go
through the legal system, a process that could take years, Warner
attorney Stuart Robinowitz said.
   Guber and Peters have about 50 projects planned for the next few
years, including sequels to the megahit ``Batman.''
   Without the injunction, the producers could possibly find
themselves unable to work for either company during the litigation,
Robinowitz said.
   Sony recently announced plans to put Guber and Peters, whose
credits also include ``Rain Man,'' in charge of Columbia after it
acquires the entertainment company in a $3.4 billion tender offer.
   Sony also plans to acquire Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for
about $200 million, or $17.50 per share.
   But Warner contended in court papers the move to hire away Guber
and Peters would violate its five-year exclusive production
contract with the producers.
   A hearing on the injunction was scheduled for Nov. 2.
   The filing for the injunction came on the heels of lawsuits Sony
and Warner filed against each other last week in Los Angeles
Superior Court.

<HEAD>Texaco To Acquire Tana Production Corp. For $476.5 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. said Friday it has agreed to acquire
Tana Production Corp. in a deal valued at $476.5 million _ part of
a continuing effort to expand oil and gas reserves and Texaco's
first major purchase since completing a massive restructuring
earlier this year.
   The merger with Corpus Christi, Texas-based Tana Production, a
subsidiary of TRT Energy Holdings Inc., includes the purchase of
435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and about 4 million barrels
of oil located in 17 South Texas fields, Texaco said.
   Texaco will pay $95.1 million in cash and the remaining $381.4
million in shares of a new, non-voting issue of Texaco Series E
variable-rate preferred stock.
   The acquisition, subject to the approval of government
regulators, is expected to be completed by the end of the year,
said Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y.
   ``We have long said that our selected focus is to maintain a
strong reserve base in the United States,'' said Texaco President
James W. Kinnear. ``This agreement ... will increase Texaco's
domestic reserves at a very attractive price.''
   Industry analysts said the merger was not a surprise.
   ``Now that they have reduced debt significantly, they can do
this,'' said Frank P. Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``Texaco has made a number of sales; this is their
first big buy.''
   Some analysts said the purchase was significant in that it
showed a reversal from recent years when Texaco entered Bankruptcy
Court and underwent a major restructuring.
   ``This sets a new course in terms of reversing the direction of
the last couple of years when they were divesting assets,'' said
Michael Young, analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Texaco filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 to avoid having to
post a multibillion-dollar security bond in its fight with Pennzoil
Co.
   Pennzoil had sued claiming Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty
Oil Co. interfered with Pennzoil's prior contract to buy part of
reserve-rich Getty. A Houston jury awarded Pennzoil a $10.3 billion
judgment. Texaco appealed but eventually settled with Pennzoil for
$3 billion.
   Earlier this year, Texaco completed a major restructuring that
involved the sale of some $7 billion in assets. Last year, Texaco
turned a profit of $1.3 billion, compared with a 1987 loss of $4.14
billion. Texaco has said the company expects a further improvement
in 1989.
   The Tana purchase strengthens Texaco's position as a seller and
producer of natural gas in the United States, Kinnear said. Texaco
already is one of the largest producers of natural gas in this
country.
   ``We feel that natural gas is a fine fuel for the future for the
highest and best use _ for home heating, for power generation, for
cogeneration and for environmental concerns.''
   Kinnear said, however, he does not expect natural gas to
challenge gasoline as a motor fuel.
   Texaco, starting with the 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil, has
attempted to improve its eroding domestic reserve base.

   The dollar ended higher Friday in quiet trading
following a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold prices were little changed. On the Commodity Exchange in
New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.30 a troy
ounce, up 20 cents from Thursday. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a late bid for gold at $366.50 an ounce, unchanged.
   Currency traders attributed Friday's rise largely to internal
market influences in the absence of any new market-moving news.
They said the market was awaiting the release of the September
durable goods report on Tuesday and the preliminary report on the
third-quarter gross national product on Thursday.
   However, Earl I. Johnson, a trader with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago, said prospects for increased demand for dollars by the
Japanese were giving some support to the currency.
   ``There seems to be fairly steady demand from institutions, such
as large insurance companies, over there. They seem to like the
(U.S.) bond market,'' Johnson said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 141.35 yen, down 0.20 yen from
Thursday's close. It was quoted at 142.30 yen in London, and at
142.425 yen in New York, up from 142.00.
   The dollar was higher against the British pound. Sterling sold
for $1.5885 in London, down from $1.5940 late Thursday. In New
York, each pound bought $1.5885, down from $1.5975.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Thursday's
quotes included: 1.8578 West German marks, up from 1.8500; 1.6285
Swiss francs, up from 1.6205; 6.3105 French francs, up from 6.2789;
1.17415 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17345; and 1,395.875 Italian
lire, up from 1,360.75.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices dipped in light trading
Friday, led by a big drop in the expiring crude contract.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of crude oil,
fell 44 cents to finish at $19.98 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract
slid 14 cents on Thursday.
   Analysts said the decline came from investors liquidating their
positions on the final trading day of the contract.
   ``There was no indication of new factors in the market,'' said
Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``There
was selling because it was overbought.''
   Crude contracts for delivery after November showed smaller
declines.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline for November delivery lost 0.14 cent to close at
54.51 cents a gallon after edging up 0.07 cent on Thursday. The
December contract fell 0.43 cent to 53.88 cents a gallon with later
contracts showing similar declines.
   Domestic heating oil for delivery in November dropped 0.45 cent
to 60.44 cents a gallon while the December contract declined 0.52
cent to 60.84 cents.

<HEAD>Smith Says Prosperity Affects Extent of Minority Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s prosperity
determines how much help it can give minority businesses, GM
Chairman Roger Smith said Friday.
   GM has several programs aimed at increasing its dealings with
minorities, such as its ``statement of fair-share principles''
agreement with the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, Smith said.
   Smith told a National Business League breakfast in Birmingham,
Ala., that the world's largest auto company hopes to start more
programs.
   ``But I must tell you our ability to make these kinds of
investments _ and to fulfill our fair-share commitments _ depends
pretty heavily on the health and profitability of our business,''
Smith said, according to a GM news release.
   GM spokesman Chuck Licari said Smith wasn't casting doubt on the
future of current programs, but pointing out that auto companies
are in a competitive pinch. ``All those programs are going
forward,'' Licari said.
   The fair-share agreement encourages GM dealings with minority
operations in purchasing, banking, insurance, advertising and other
areas.
   GM also has a minority small-business investment company, Motor
Enterprises Inc., that has provided nearly $8 million in financial
assistance to about 250 minority companies, Smith said.
   GM has 208 minority-owned car and truck dealerships, has
deposited more than $900 million in minority-owned banks, has
nearly $14 billion in property damage insurance with minority-owned
brokers, and placed $7.7 million in advertising last year with
minority-owned media, he said.

<HEAD>What Makes The ``Dow'' Go?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Dow Jones industrial average plunges
more than 200 points one week and rebounds by more than 100 the
next, what sense can any follower of the stock market make of it
all?
   That's precisely what has happened this month, in an
appropriately dramatic observance of the anniversaries of both the
``market meltdown'' of 1987 and the Great Crash of 1929.
   After taking a 216.26-point slide Oct. 9-13, it climbed a record
119.88 points last week.
   An onlooker might dismiss this performance as just another
example of the anything-goes mentality that has prevailed on Wall
Street for much of the 1980s.
   It might, with some accuracy, also be ascribed to the
mischievous forces of program trading, which allows traders to
deluge the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with millions of
dollars worth of orders in the blink of a computer terminal screen.
   Whatever its other causes, it must be noted that some of the
``volatility'' exhibited by the Dow average these days is a
mathematical illusion.
   Though its caretakers have taken considerable pains to preserve
it as a Wall Street institution, the Dow average simply is not
quite the same creature it was 10 or 20 years ago.
   The most obvious difference is its natural tendency to post
larger daily point gains now that it has reached levels two, three
or even five times where it stood a decade or two ago.
   The average's 190.58 loss on Friday the 13th this month was its
second largest point decline ever, exceeded only by the 508-point
drop it suffered on Black Monday two years ago.
   But in percentage terms, it didn't even make the top ten in the
Wall Street record books.
   A second important, and more subtle, change has arisen from the
way the average is adjusted over time to take into account
developments such as splits in its component stocks.
   If there never were any such changes in its makeup, the average
could be computed at any time simply by adding up the prices of the
30 individual stocks, and then dividing by 30.
   But because innumerable splits have taken place over the years,
the divisor has steadily dwindled down, dropping below 1 in 1986.
It now stands at 0.61.
   That means that if each of the 30 stocks in the Dow were to rise
or fall 1 point, the average would show a gain or loss of 49 points.
   In fact, the divisor has shrunk by more than half since the end
of 1983.
   Periodically in recent years, some Wall Streeters have urged
that the Dow itself be split _ reduced to one-half or one-third of
its previous value, with a proportionate revision of the divisor
and adjustment of historical data _ in order to lessen the
perceived volatility of stock prices.
   These campaigns haven't ever gone very far, however, since such
a move would put a great many asterisks in market history and
create the possibility of a lot of confusion.
   ``The industrial average's historical continuity...is one of its
most popular features,'' wrote Victor J. Hillery, a long-time
market chronicler for The Wall Street Journal, in a 1986 book on
the history of the Dow.
   The debate on such matters promises to continue. As the
Boston-based United &amp; Babson Investment Report puts it in a current
look at the average:
   ``Some say it is too small, stodgy and misleading, but the Dow
Jones industrial average is still `the market' to most people.''

<TEXT>
   Call it opportunity or ghoulish economics, but
the killer California earthquake of 1989 has aroused enthusiasm
among investors and speculators as a new source of multibillion
dollar profits.
   The 6.9 Richter Scale temblor that heaved the San Francisco Bay
area this past week was by far the worst to hit the region since
the Great Quake of 1906 and was the third major natural disaster to
befall the country in weeks. Parts of the South still are cleaning
up from two big hurricanes.
   Almost immediately after the quake collapsed buildings and
entombed dead motorists in crushed cars under a toppled freeway,
the dispassionate market strategists of stocks and bonds were busy
reckoning which companies would benefit from demand for
reconstruction and an outpouring of federal aid. Damage estimates
surpassed $4 billion by Friday.
   Shares of homebuilders, cement makers and lumber companies got a
big boost from the quake. Some large insurance companies also
benefited on the hunch that they would be able to use the
opportunity to raise rates.
   A few leading Wall Street brokerages were touting
Georgia-Pacific and Willamette Industries Inc., for example, as
opportunities in what The Wall Street Journal described as ``the
best post-quake plywood plays.''
   That may sound horrifying and repugnant, but many economists say
such a reaction misses the point. They argue that the quick
response by investors is part of the efficiency that makes the
American economy function smoothly.
   Some even contend that profound calamities like earthquakes and
hurricanes actually boost overall economic growth over a long
period of time by creating an enormous demand for goods and
services in afflicted areas. A few suggested the earthquake helped
stabilize the wobbly U.S. stock market.
   ``The initial impact is a drain on the growth rate of the
economy,'' said Thomas F. Carpenter, director of economics for ASB
Capital Management, a Washington investment concern. But later, he
said, ``what is torn down gets rebuilt. And that rebuilding
activity is obviously a generator of income and employment and acts
as a positive factor, a positive thrust.''
   Other economists sharply disagree with that line of thinking.
They say disasters are bad, period.
   ``I guess I don't have a lot of sympathy with the argument that
if you want to have a robust economy, you ought to have a war,''
said Gail Fosler, chief economist of the Conference Board, a New
York-based business research group.
   ``I think the perverse impact of this kind of disaster, economic
activity, just goes to show you can get very perverse results if
you look at the wrong targets,'' she said. ``You would have been
net better off had you not had the disaster.''
   Deborah Allen, president of the Claremont Economics Institute, a
consulting firm in Claremont, Calif., said the argument that
disasters create economic growth is flawed because wealth must be
destroyed first.
   ``You have a tremendous growth spurt, but it's from a lower
base,'' she said. ``A few years later, net you're worse off. You
haven't produced something new that you didn't have yesterday.''
   Guy Henshaw, president of Civicbankcorp in Oakland, Calif., said
there probably was some truth to the idea that the infrastructure
damage to the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area would
generate much more economic activity. He said rumors were
circulating that vast areas of downtown office space in Oakland
were condemned because of damage.
   ``That means some of the overcapacity has gone away. That will
help,'' he said. ``It's somewhat black humor, but at least we've
got the capacity to rebuild.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The weakened stock market largely recovered after one of the
most uncertain weeks since the Black Monday crash exactly two years
earlier. Investment professionals attributed the comeback largely
to a realization among many investors that conditions responsible
for the 1987 plunge weren't evident.
   _Proposed takeovers of the nation's two biggest airlines grew
more unlikely. British Airways PLC dropped its backing of an
employee-management group attempting to buy UAL Corp. in a
debt-financed deal valued at $6.75 billion, and developer Donald
Trump scrapped his $7 billion proposal for AMR Corp.
   _The government issued more conflicting signals on economic
growth. September housing starts sank 5.2 percent and consumer
prices rose 0.2 percent, suggesting the economy is slowing down.
But the trade deficit swelled sharply in August because of rising
imports, suggesting inflation remains a threat.
   _The doll industry said goodbye to Freddy Krueger and hello
again to the Cabbage Patch kids. The Matchbox toy company
capitulated to pressure from a fundamentalist Christian group
urging it to scrap plans to market a doll based on the fiend in the
``Nightmare on Elm Street'' movies, and Hasbro Inc. began a
hard-sell campaign to pitch the cuddly Cabbage Patch family bought
from Coleco Industries Inc.

   The stock market posted mixed results Friday,
closing out a week of record-setting recovery from the scary
selloff of Oct. 13.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.94 to 2,689.14,
stretching its gain for the week to 119.88 points. The previous
largest weekly point gain for the average was 114.86, in the week
ended June 3, 1988.
   In five days' time the Dow has recovered more than half its
Friday-the-13th loss of 190.58 points.
   Declines outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in the daily tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 662 up, 829 down and
478 unchanged.
   Analysts said optimism about the takeover outlook, after slowly
reviving in recent days, suffered a new setback when British
Airways said it wouldn't take part in any effort to revive a buyout
deal for UAL Corp.
   UAL shares, which traded as high as 294 before buyout plans for
the company ran into trouble, tumbled 21| to 168{.
   However, in contrast to a week earlier when the deal first went
sour, the action in UAL was no longer dragging the rest of the
market down with it.
   This week many analysts have suggested that fading enthusiasm
for takeover speculation might be a plus for the overall market, by
restoring an emphasis on such traditional reference points as
earnings and dividend growth.
   Brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously as
they waited for the passing of another monthly ``witching hour''
involving the last trading of expiring stock options and stock
index futures contracts.
   As it turned out, the occasion seemed to work in the market's
favor by producing some buying of blue chips near the close.
   In addition, some observers said the market was still feeling
the positive effects of the government report Thursday that the
consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in September.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose \ to 43|; Exxon gained ] to 46[; Coca-Cola added ] to 70}, and
International Business Machines was up [ at 104\.
   Hercules Inc., which reported a third-quarter earnings gain that
evidently fell short of investors' hopes, fell 3\ to 44].
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.83 million
shares, down from 198.12 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 192.47 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $0.93 billion, or 0.03
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .05 to 192.12.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .27 to 396.30, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .03 at 347.16.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped .13 to 470.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 382.57, down .24.

<TEXT>
   The television arms of Paramount Communications
Inc. and MCA Inc. have described to some station executives a plan
to offer prime-time programming two nights a week as a step toward
creating a fifth TV network, industry executives said Friday.
   The network the executives said was described by Paramount and
MCA would compete with NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox Broadcasting Co.
   Reports of plans for the network were carried first by Daily
Variety, the trade newspaper, earlier this week and several major
newspapers subsequently carried similar accounts of the plans.
   But the Los Angeles Times reported Friday that the deal
apparently had fallen apart.
   Citing an unidentified source familiar with the deal, the Times
said there was a ``so-called programming service that had been on
the boards, but a snag developed in the agreement between Paramount
and MCA, as a result of which this activity has been discontinued.''
   A spokeswoman for Paramount said from Los Angeles that her
company does not comment on rumors or speculation. A call was
placed to Shelly Schwab, president of MCA TV in Los Angeles, but it
was not returned and others in the company said they were not
authorized to comment on any of the reports.
   Brad Turell, a spokesman for Fox Broadcasting in Los Angeles,
said ``some of our affiliates have been contacted'' by Paramount
and MCA about whether they would be interested in carrying some
prime-time programming.
   Michael Fisher, president and general manager at KTXL in
Sacramento, Calif., and head of the Fox affiliates board, said at
least one Fox affiliate who he declined to identify told him that
Paramount and MCA executives had described plans to make two nights
of prime-time programming available starting Jan. 1, 1991.
   The plans were to program movies on Wednesday nights and offer
TV series on Friday nights, he said. The plans were to make a third
night of programming available about six months later, Fisher said.
   Fisher, who said he was not approached by Paramount or MCA, said
he was told Paramount and MCA were interested in starting a fifth
network.
   But Fisher said he thought it was unlikely that any Fox
affiliates would defect. ``They have been with Fox for three years
and Fox has done precisely what they said they were going to do,''
he said.
   Fox offers network programming on three nights and claims 127
affiliate stations. It plans to add two additional nights of
programming next year and offer programming on all seven nights a
week in 1992.
   Turell said top Fox Broadcasting executives planned to meet with
Fox affiliates in a series of six regional meetings next week to
reaffirm the company's plans.
   MCA owns WWOR-TV in New York and Paramount last month agreed to
buy a 79 percent stake in the TVX Broadcast Group, which owns five
stations.
   Those stations could form the core for a new network.
   Last month, Paramount and MCA announced a joint venture called
Premier Advertiser Sales, to sell advertising in programs they
syndicate.
   Those shows include ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and
``Charles in Charge.''

   Though the financial storm that many feared
never struck, Wall Street analysts still aren't sure the stock
market is headed for clear sailing in the weeks and months ahead.
   To government regulators, securities industry officials and just
about anyone else with a stake in the well-being of the market, the
past week provided a pleasant surprise.
   As the workweek began Monday, the Street was braced for a
possible replay of the crash of 1987, following the ``Friday the
13th massacre'' in which the Dow Jones industrial average fell 190
points.
   Instead, blue-chip stocks began a rally that spread to many
smaller, secondary issues as the week progressed.
   Once the commotion began to die down, many observers concluded
stocks had simply experienced a sharp but short ``correction'' that
had little bearing on either the outlook for the economy or
long-term investment prospects.
   Maybe so, say analysts now, but even if it was only a
coincidence, the market's sudden drop came at a time when the trend
in corporate profits was showing some early signs of weakening.
   Furthermore, technical analysts have questioned whether it
wasn't a bit too pat to chalk up the Oct. 13 decline as a handy
catch-up buying opportunity for investors who had missed out on the
gains in stock prices earlier in the year.
   ``It may be many weeks before we can fully understand the
long-term impact of Oct. 13 on the U.S. equity market,'' said
Joseph Barthel at Hopper Soliday &amp; Co.
   ``For now it suffices to say that serious technical damage to
the long-standing uptrend has occurred.''
   There has been no notable revival lately on Wall Street of the
recession fears so widely voiced at midsummer. Confidence has
remained high that the economy can achieve a ``soft landing'' that
provides the chance for renewed growth as 1990 passes.
   Still, ``even a soft landing isn't painless,'' observed Edward
Kerschner and Charles Pradilla, analysts at PaineWebber Inc.
``Historically, soft landings for the overall economy have been
hard landings for profits.''
   Forecasters aren't calling for any drastic drop in earnings just
now. But many do contend that the strong gains of the past couple
of years are giving way to a leveling off or moderate decline.
   ``The `thrill is gone' from U.S. corporate profits,'' said Abby
Joseph Cohen, an investment strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. ``Profit growth has decelerated, return on equity has peaked.''
   Such cautionary notes didn't do much to dampen investors'
enthusiasm for marked-down merchandise in the stock market this
past week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 216.26 points the
week before, rebounded a record 119.88 to 2,689.14.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.56 to 192.12;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
3.34 to 470.63, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 3.88 at 382.57.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 234.04 million shares a day,
against 161.95 million the week before.
   Optimists on the market outlook say stocks can weather a
temporary earnings decline if investors are able to see signs of a
future revival of profit expansion.
   ``Subpar growth means negative earnings comparisons for cyclical
companies,'' acknowledged John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``But it would take more economic weakness than we are looking
for to create a significant drop in overall corporate earnings.''

<HEAD>Senate Leader Doubts Congress Will Approve Bush Capital-Gains Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said
Friday he doubts Congress will vote to cut capital gains this year.
   President Bush has been pressing hard for a capital-gains tax
cut.
   Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, told reporters it is difficult to
predict a vote on the issue because there is no certainty what type
of capital-gains cut the Senate will be considering.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said Thursday that he can count 55 to
58 votes _ a majority _ for his own capital-gains proposal.
   That is not necessarily in conflict with what Mitchell said.
Democrats, most of whom stiffly oppose any cut in capital-gains
taxes, might filibuster against Packwood's plan, and it would take
60 votes to shut off debate.
   Packwood and Sen. Bill Roth, R-Del., are sponsoring a plan to
exclude between 5 percent and 35 percent of capital gains from
taxation, depending on how long an asset was owned before it was
sold. The bill also would let workers set up Individual Retirement
Accounts that would allow tax-free withdrawals for medical
expenses, education, home-buying or retirement.
   The Packwood-Roth plan is backed by the Bush administration. The
president also supports a less-ambitious capital-gains cut that has
been passed by the House over opposition of the Democratic
leadership.
   Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, said the Packwood-Roth plan ``raises
real questions about fiscal responsibility.''
   Tax benefits for IRAs are going to cost the same whether the
benefits are provided at the time a contribution is made _ as under
current law _ or when a withdrawal is made from an IRA, as Packwood
and Roth are recommending, Mitchell said.
   ``The only question is which generation is going to pay for
it,'' Mitchell said.
   The Democratic leader took a swipe at Bush for pressing so hard
for the capital-gains cut that he promised in last year's
presidential campaign.
   ``I would like to see the president devote as much time to
presidential policy in response to historic events in Western and
Eastern Europe,'' Mitchell said. ``I'd like to see him devote a
fraction of the time to that, that he is to this capital-gains
debacle.''

<HEAD>Pacific Stock Exchange Plans to Resume Operations Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pacific Stock Exchange said Friday it would resume normal
trading at its San Francisco home on Monday after the Bay Quake
shut it down and traders were dispatched around the country to keep
the market alive.
   ``Our facilities are intact,'' exchange chairman Maurice Mann
said in a statement. ``Public safety authorities and building
inspectors have examined our options trading floor in San Francisco
and declared it sound structurally and safe for occupancy.''
   Mann also said the exchange's equities trading floor and other
facilities were safe and the opening bell would ring Monday at 6:30
a.m. PST.
   About 150 Pacific options traders and support staffers were sent
to exchanges in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia on Thursday and
Friday to trade stock options that are listed solely on the Pacific
exchange.
   Some trading occurred Wednesday, the day after the Bay area's
devastating earthquake, at the exchange in San Francisco, where
dealers worked with the aid of flashlights and candles, rerouting
trades via phone through Los Angeles.
   The traders were relocated east because the Los Angeles exchange
does not trade options.
   The Pacific exchange trades options _ which many investors use
to hedge their stock positions _ in 130 underlying stocks, with
some 70,000 contracts changing hands on an average day.
   Among big-name stocks that have options traded only on the
Pacific exchange are Hilton Hotels Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.
   ``On Monday we will have business as usual on all of our trading
floors,'' Mann said. ``Markets will be made, orders will be filled
and the PSE will continue to meet its public responsibility as a
securities marketplace.''

<TEXT>
   At 2:40 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 13, the New York
Stock Exchange halted trading in shares of UAL Corp. on reports
that a $6.75 billion buyout was collapsing.
   Instantly the news poisoned the market for stocks of other
takeover targets. If financing fizzled for the labor-management
takeover of United Airlines' parent, what deal was safe?
   By 3 p.m. the Dow Jones industrial average had tumbled 56.97
points. Panic spread through the hundreds of traders, specialists
and clerks on the floor of the three-story trading atrium.
   ``Every arb and his brother sold everything he could get his
hands on,'' said a major Wall Street arbitrager who dumped a large
UAL stake at a loss.
   By day's end, the Dow average declined 190.58 points, the
second-largest point drop in history. And all thoughts turned to
Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, when the market crashed after a similar
Friday selloff.
   In the 65 hours from Friday's close to the market's opening
Monday, unprecedented steps were taken to keep credit lines open,
promote post-crash safety measures and allay investors' fears.
   Interviews with exchange leaders, government officials and
market professionals show that those steps _ all taken with 1987 in
mind _ helped stop the Friday the 13th selloff from becoming
Nightmare on Wall Street Part II.
   ``It was knowing that the possible consequence of inaction could
be so dire that we all had to act that way,'' said Ivers Riley,
senior vice president at the American Stock Exchange.
   The bounce-back also suggested that leadership, more than
regulation, proved the key to holding the markets together. What
prevented a second coronary, officials said, was not
``circuit-breaker'' trading halts, but a determination to maintain
calm so that orderly buying and selling _ even high-volume
computerized trading _ could proceed.
   ``The more progress we can make towards bringing the regulation
into one place, or to bring it into a high degree of coordination,
the better off we're going to be at it,'' Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady said.
   Extraordinary action was evident everywhere, from Treasury
Department backrooms in Washington, to trading rooms at New York
brokerages, to suburban living rooms where executives mapped
strategies while the World Series played on TV.
   _After checking his bank credit line, a veteran NYSE specialist
arranged $20 million in emergency financing from friends _ just in
case of another Black Monday. The specialist had to buy a
remarkable $25 million of stock in 75 minutes Friday, doubling his
normal daily inventory, to fulfill his role as a ``market maker''
who ensures smooth trading.
   _Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Securities and
Exchange Commission officials analyzed Friday's trading and
telephoned important market participants. ``We were at it all
weekend,'' one source said.
   _About 200 Amex traders and officials gathered Saturday to
complete the paperwork on Friday's hectic dealings. NYSE leaders
called member firms and specialists to ensure they had adequate
capital should the market collapse. Technicians checked computers
that NYSE officials had hailed for months as fully capable of
handling enormous volumes.
   _Retail brokerages opened offices in a broad campaign to ease
fears. Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. _ whose 6,500
brokers at 325 branch offices fielded client calls all weekend _
dictated the company line via the firm's nationwide communications
network: ``This is not 1987.''
   Despite those assurances, the spooky similarities between Friday
the 13th and Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, dominated everyone's thinking.
Fears about rising interest rates and the decline of the 1980s
takeover boom played roles in both Friday slides.
   The market already was down about 25 points when the UAL
announcement hit. Arbitragers _ stock speculators who seek to
profit on short-term rises in takeover targets like UAL _ exited
quickly.
   Money managers for pension funds, insurance companies and mutual
funds followed. Some reported phone lines were so clogged they
couldn't get orders in _ another Black Monday reminder.
   ``You had a bandwagon psychology,'' one NYSE floor specialist
said. ``They became fearful for a repeat of the crash and you had a
headlong retreat.''
   Cramer &amp; Co., a New York firm that manages $20 million in
assets, reduced the stock segment of its portfolio from 35 percent
to 10 percent, joining a wave triggered by frantic selling of
stock-index futures.
   Many professional trading strategies exploit the links between
the stock market and contracts traded in the futures markets that
are based on the future prices of large groups of stocks.
   ``Once the UAL deal broke there were massive sell programs in
futures,'' said Cramer president, James J. Cramer.
   Hot lines among the major exchanges in New York and Chicago,
installed after the 1987 crash, were opened Friday when the market
began tumbling. Phone links also were established with Washington.
   After the close, even the biggest firms checked with banks to
ensure they had adequate capital and credit lines that could be
expanded if necessary. Traders stayed late into the night
dissecting what happened.
   Some Wall Street executives conferred in emergency sessions on
Saturday and Sunday, but panic wasn't apparent; the president of
one major brokerage attended ``family weekend'' at his daughter's
upstate New York college.
   The firms _ whose long-term profitability depends on demand for
stocks _ worked to control the damage. At 5:30 p.m. Friday, for
example, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. issued a statement aimed at soothing
investors, noting what it called the differences between 1989 and
1987.
   Merrill and its competitors emphasized the economy was slowing
and the dollar was strong, vs. October 1987 when the economy was
growing sharply and the dollar weak. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
analysts compiled a list of stocks to recommend.
   ``What we had to do was kind of say, `You should not overreact
and liquidate positions. The right thing to do is stay in there,'''
said Richard Sichenzio, retail group president at Prudential-Bache.
   Still, Wall Street feared two major possibilities: Investors
would ignore the advice and overseas markets would react negatively
to Friday's selloff.
   In an attempt to forestall those prospects, a Federal Reserve
official said Saturday the Fed would inject as much money as
necessary into the banking system to avoid a crisis. It was an
extraordinary pronouncement by the Fed, which almost never
discloses its intentions. In 1987, the Fed didn't act until after
the crash.
   NYSEofficials, meanwhile, touted post-crash innovations designed
to stem a market landslide, including the ``circuit breakers'' that
would halt trading temporarily in New York and Chicago if prices
sunk below certain levels.
   On Sunday night, Wall Street strategists gathered to monitor the
market opening in Tokyo, where it was Monday morning. The Japanese
market fell less than 2 percent and stabilized.
   At Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., one of the biggest Wall Street
brokerages, equities divisions held a 6 a.m. strategy session with
linkups to London and Tokyo.
   ``I don't feel at all that this is a situation that's comparable
to 1987 and that we're looking at a big crash,'' Morgan's chief
strategist, Barton Biggs, told employees in an 8:15 a.m. video and
telephone hookup.
   The New York market opened lower, partly because stock-index
futures prices in Chicago tumbled and stock prices followed. But a
lack of selling by large institutions such as pension funds and
insurance companies sent a positive signal.
   When a major futures index suddenly turned upward, so did the
underlying blue-chip stocks, where bargains abounded, like IBM at
less than $100 a share. The Dow Jones rallied, finishing up 88
points on the day, and the crisis faded.
   The absence of ``portfolio insurance,'' a strategy blamed for
accelerating the 1987 decline in stock and stock-index futures
prices, may have helped arrest another panic, some professionals
said. But some forms of program trading were still very much in
evidence.
   In the end, it may have been the fear of disaster that prevented
one.
   ``People certainly have a memory,'' said Joseph Schmuckler, a
senior vice president at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. ``They were a lot
more concerned. I think being very conscious of what happened two
years ago was very positive.''

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plummet On Canadian Strike Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices plummeted to new lows for the month Friday
as a 3{-month strike at a large Canadian copper mine ended and
Mexico's biggest copper mine reportedly prepared to reopen after a
two-month shutdown.
   On other commodity markets Friday, precious metals were nearly
flat; energy futures fell; grains and soybeans retreated; livestock
and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Copper futures settled 2.9 sents to 4.5 cents lower on New
York's Commodity Exchange with the contract for December delivery
at $1.2345 a pound, its lowest price since Sept. 29.
   Union workers at the Highland Valley copper mine in British
Columbia ratified a new contract Thursday night, ending a strike
that began July 6, and were to report to work Saturday, said
company spokesman Rod Killough.
   The mine is capable of producing 180,000 tons of copper
annually, more than 3 percent of the world's output. Analysts said
new supplies from Highland Valley could begin reaching copper
consumers within a month.
   A wire-service report that Mexico's state-owned Cananea mine may
reopen within a week helped further to ease the tight-supply fears
that have supported the copper market for about four months. The
160,000 tons-per-year mine closed Aug. 20, allegedly due to
financial mismanagement.
   Another major copper mine, the Bougainville mine in Papua New
Guinea, remains shut down due to terrorist activity.
   But even that situation appears to be improving, three months
after the mine closed, said Craig Sloane, a metals analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``There's some talk that the landowners are trying to hold out
an olive branch to meet with the rebels,'' Sloane said. ``It's hard
to say if we're really near any kind of resolution but one can say
it's a little more optimistic than it looked before.''
   Gold futures settled unchanged on the Comex with December at
$370.60 a troy ounce; silver was 0.7 cent to 0.9 cent higher with
December at $5.14 an ounce.
   Oil futures prices dipped in light trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, led by a 44-cent drop in the expiring November
crude contract to $19.98 a barrel.
   Other West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 27 cents
lower to 4 cents higher with December at $20.15 a barrel; heating
oil was .37 cent to .52 cent lower with November at 60.44 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .14 cent to .45 cent lower with
November at 54.51 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished slightly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade, reflecting pre-weekend profit-taking after a week
of substantial gains in the corn and soybean markets.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced a sale of
2.8 million metric tons of corn and 160,000 metric tons of soybean
meal to the Soviet Union.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to } cent lower with December at
$4.07 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2{ cents lower with December
at $2.41{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with
December at $1.44} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2{ cents lower
with November at $5.63{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures settled lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
ahead of the USDA's quarterly cattle-on-feed report while pork
futures advanced
   The report showed 6 percent fewer cattle being fattened for
slaughter as of Oct. 1 compared to a year ago in the 13 largest
cattle-producing states. The number was lower than anticipated and
is likely to prompt some buying of cattle futures on Monday.
   The October live cattle contract expired 1.17 cents lower at
73.25 cents a pound; the October live hog contract expired .30 cent
lower at 49.05 cents a pound.
   Other live cattle contracts settled .03 cent to .27 cent lower
with December at 75.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged
to .20 cent lower with October at 82.80 cents a pound; hogs were
.15 cent to .35 cent lower with December at 46.80 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .75 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February
at 52.85 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures rose modestly on the Chicago Merc, where the
contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index settled .85 point higher at 350.45. The contract
is valued at $500 a point.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Finish Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government bond prices finished lower Friday in
sluggish trading, weighed down by concerns about a heavy supply of
new issues.
   The 30-year Treasury bond lost \ point, or $2.50 for each $1,000
in face amount, after being up as much as $3.75 earlier in the day.
Its yield rose to 7.98 percent from 7.96 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said the market's early rise was an extension of
Thursday's rally, which saw 30-year bond prices rise by about $8
for every $1,000 in face value due to a report of a
smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices last month.
   But they said prices gave ground in slow activity in the
afternoon as traders apparently took profits on the recent runup in
prices and others looked toward a large supply of new issues that
is to be auctioned next week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments fell 5-32 point, intermediate maturities
lost 6-32 point and long-term issues dropped as much as \ point,
according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.79 to 1,187.63.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities
of five years or longer, rose 0.05 to 337.85.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 11-32 point to 92 17-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.34 percent from 7.31 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.80 percent as the
discount rose 1 basis point to 7.56 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.95 percent as the discount lost 1 basis point to
7.55 percent.
   Yields on one-year bills held steady at 7.87 percent as the
discount was unchanged from Thursday's auction level at 7.34
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 811-16 percent, the same as Thursday's late
rate.

<HEAD>BP Sells Australian Coal Interests to CRA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC said Friday it has
agreed to sell its Australian coal business to CRA Ltd. for $275
million in cash, as part of a recently announced restructuring of
the London-based company.
   The deal, announced after a meeting of British Petroleum
executives and securities analysts in New York, is expected to be
closed on Nov. 30. The sale is subject to approval by government
regulators.
   ``This is the first step in the divestment of our worldwide coal
interests,'' said Patrick Gillam, a BP managing director.
   CRA Ltd. is a mining and minerals company based in Melbourne,
Australia. BP Australia Ltd. currently has about 770 million tons
of extractable reserves, the company said.
   On June 15, BP announced it would put up for sale the major part
of its worldwide coal interests, including assets and operations in
the United States, Australia, South Africa and Europe.
   The sale is part of a previously announced restructuring of
British Petroleum, the world's fourth largest oil concern. In
addition to reorganizing its exploration and production operations,
the company is also reducing its work force by 17 percent, or 1,700
jobs.
   British Petroleum said it would use the proceeds from the coal
sale to ``strengthen our balance sheet and to take advantage of
investment opportunities for our other businesses.''
   Analysts estimate BP's long-term debt will be about $8.8 billion
at the end of 1989. BP has sold approximately $6.5 billion in
assets this year alone.
   Last month, BP announced it was selling a portion of its North
Sea properties as well as exploration assets in six countries to
Oryx Energy Co. of Dallas for $1.31 billion.
   John Ralph, managing director and chief executive of CRA, said
the sale was a good move for the Melbourne company.
   ``The purchase of BP Australia's coal business...will fit well
with CRA's existing coal business,'' he said. ``It will strengthen
the group's base in the coal business and contribute to its
profitable growth.''

   Media General Inc. said Friday its profit fell
about 63 percent in the latest quarter, attributing the decline to
weakness in newspaper advvertising linage and declines in newsprint
sales.
   Profit fell to $3.94 million, or 15 cents a share, from $10.8
million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to
$142.3 million from $181.8 million during the same period last

   During the first nine months of 1989, profit fell to $21.9
million, or 84 cents a share, from $38.4 million, or $1.34 a share,
a year earlier. Revenue totaled $441.5 million, compared with
$564.4 million the year before.
   The company said the sale last year of the broadcast services
unit and a newsprint mill in Pomona, Calif., account for the
decline in revenues.
   The company said there was encouraging growth in net paid
circulation of its newspapers.

<HEAD>Pittston Earnings Drop 79 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pittston Co. on Friday reported
third-quarter earnings fell about 79 percent to $3.1 million from
$14.7 million during the same period last year, a decrease
primarily caused by losses in the company's strike-bound coal
division.
   Earnings per share fell to 8 cents during this year's third
quarter from 38 cents during the third quarter of 1988, the company
said. Revenue edged down to $395.3 million from $398.3 million a
year earlier.
   Losses at the Pittston Coal Group increased to $9.8 million in
the third quarter, up from $3.6 million in the second quarter, as
the strike of Pittston coal mines widened. The company said it has
spent $20 million since the strike began to protect its employees
and property from strike-related violence.
   But while Pittston Coal's earnings fell, another Pittston
division, Burlington Air Express, had $9.2 million in earnings in
the third quarter, up from $3.8 million during the same period last
year, the company said.
   Third-quarter earnings at Pittston's Brink's division were $7.1
million, virtually unchanged from the same quarter last year, the
company said.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Pittston said
earnings fell to $22.6 million, or 60 cents a share, from $33.4
million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.23
billion from $1.17 billion.

Australian parent's $1.5 billion deal to buy MGM-UA Communications
Corp. collapsed over a missed $50 million down payment.
   The announcement crushed Qintex Entertainment stock, which lost
more than 60 percent of its value Friday. It fell $2.62{ to $1.50
in over-the-counter trading.
   The television production and distribution company was unable to
make an overdue payment of $5.9 million by a key Thursday deadline,
a lapse that could have triggered a devastating wave of demands
from creditors, the company said.
   Qintex Entertainment is 43 percent owned by Qintex Australia
Ltd., which had provided about $110 million in capital to the
American company over the past four years.
   Qintex Entertainment's chief financial officer, John Lloyd, said
the American company had been assured by its Australian parent that
it would get the $5.9 million by the deadline Thursday.
   But at a board meeting Wednesday, Qintex Australia indicated it
was ``unable or unwilling'' to help Qintex America make the
payment, Lloyd said.
   The payment was related to a distribution deal involving MCA
Inc. and Hal Roach Studios Inc., a Qintex Entertainment subsidiary.
The Roach studios and Qintex Productions Inc., the company's other
operating subsidiary, also filed for protection from creditors
under protection of federal bankruptcy law.
   The announcement underlined the difficulty that Qintex Australia
faces in reviving a bid for MGM-UA. The Australian company had
approached NBC and several foreign companies about helping finance
the takeover.
   Qintex Entertainment had been expected to be part of the
emerging company, but officials said they now envision Qintex
Entertainment going its own way if it can successfully reorganize
under protection from its creditors.
   ``We think we have a very viable company here, but we had to do
this to protect our shareholders,'' Lloyd, the chief financial
officer, said in a telephone interview.
   ``We do not believe at this time that the company will require
additional financing while in Chapter 11,'' Lloyd said.
   He said production would continue on such programs as the
syndicated sports and variety program ``Roller Games'' and a
Hallmark Hall of Fame two-hour special starring Walter Matthau,
``Incident at Lincoln Bluff.''
   The company expects to have about $100 million in revenues this
year. Its other programs include ``Kids Incorporated,'' in its
sixth season on the Disney Channel, and ``The New Leave It to
Beaver'' syndicated show.
   As of the end of its third quarter April 30, Quintex had
liabilities of $155 million and assets of $218 million.
   MGM-UA had agreed to be acquired by Qintex Australia, but broke
off the deal Oct. 9 after Qintex missed the $50 million down
payment. MGM-UA also filed a $50 million breach-of-contract suit in
federal court, accusing Qintex of interfering with an earlier $1.4
billion bid for MGM-UA by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
   Qintex Entertainment was not a party to the formal merger
agreement with MGM-UA and is not named in the lawsuit.
   Qintex Entertainment also announced that David Evans had
resigned as president and chief executive officer of Qintex
Entertainment, but said he would continue as a full-time consultant
until a successor can be named.
