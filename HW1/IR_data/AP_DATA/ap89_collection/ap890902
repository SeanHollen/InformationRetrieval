<UNK>Two British Soldiers Wouned in Gun Attack in West Germany</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen firing from a passing car wounded two
British soldiers in West Germany late Friday night, the Defense
Ministry in London reported.
   No group asserted responsibility for the attack in Muenster,
northwest Germany, but the ministry suspected members of the Irish
Republican Army.
   The outlawed IRA has attacked British troops stationed in West
Germany in recent years, extending its guerrilla warfare from
Northern Ireland.
   A ministry statement said the soldiers were off-duty and wearing
plain clothes when they were shot at as they walked toward their
barracks at 11 p.m. The soldiers were hospitalized but their
condition was not given.
   The Muenster barracks is headquarters of the British Army's 4th
Armored Brigade in West Germany.
   West German authorities this week intensified their search for
IRA guerrillas believed operating there after a Monday bombing
attempt on a British military housing area in Hanover. A British
soldier spotted the bomb under his car and it was safely defused.
   The Federal Criminal Office in Wiesbaden, West Germany's national
investigative body, said Tuesday that investigators were looking for
apartments and weapons caches used by the Irish guerrillas.
   It said the bomb found in Hanover is believed to have come from
an IRA cache in West Germany. It was the third IRA-related bomb
incident at a British military post in northern Germany this summer.
   On July 2, a bomb killed a British soldier as he was getting into
his car in a Hanover residential area housing many British military
families.
   A bomb exploded in the living quarters at a British barracks near
Osnabrueck on June 19, but no one was injured.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern
Ireland, a British province where Protestants outnumber Catholics
3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

<HEAD>Gonzalez Calls Early Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez on Friday
called early elections for Oct. 29, trying to take advantage of a
four-year economic boom that is endangered by inflation and a
growing trade deficit.
   Gonzalez, 47, seeks an unprecedented third term for his Socialist
Party.
   He said he is calling elections eight months before the legal end
of the current four-year legislative session ``to seek a new mandate
to meet the important challenges'' when Western Europe drops trade
barriers in 1993.
   ``What we seek is sustained economic growth to continue job
creation, our prime objective,'' Gonzalez told reporters.
   He touted the booming Spanish economy that has averaged a
European-high 4.5 percent annual growth since 1986, the year the
country joined the European Economic Community. But he also warned
against runaway consumer spending.
   King Juan Carlos will sign a decree Saturday setting elections
for Oct. 29.
   The date chosen is seven years and a day from the Oct. 28, 1982,
landslide victory that gave the Socialists their first absolute
majority of 202 seats in the 350-seat lower house of Parliament.
   Gonzalez also seeks to take advantage of disarray among centrist
and rightist forces.
   A major factor in his decision is considered the Socialists'
performance in June 15 European Parliament elections.
   The Socialists won 39.5 percent of votes, enough to gain another
majority in Parliament and govern alone through 1993, analysts said.
   If re-elected, Gonzalez is expected to take stiff measures to
curtail demand and try to maintain the economy's momentum, needed to
reduce Spain's 17.3 percent unemployment rate, Europe's highest.
   Observers say a clear Socialist victory will relieve pressure
from unions seeking greater social spending. A long-running dispute
between the government and the Socialist General Workers Union led
to a one-day national strike by workers Dec. 14 that paralyzed the
country. But the Socialists appear to have regained momentum since
that low point in popular support.
   Socialists now hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house of
Parliament. The Popular Party holds 91, the centrists 28, and the
conservative Catalan minority 19. Smaller parties hold the rest.

<HEAD>Will Leona Go To Prison?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that Leona Helmsley is a convicted tax
evader, the question arises: Will the billionaire hotelier,
accustomed to a penthouse apartment and a 28-acre country estate, go
to jail?
   Or will she be sentenced to community service _ forced to live in
and manage a city welfare hotel, perhaps, as a mayoral candidate
urged Friday?
   And how much of her money will she have to give up?
   The answers lie with U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr., who has
scheduled sentencing for Nov. 14.
   Walker's options range from probation and community service to
prison time and fines that could go as high as $8 million.
   Mrs. Helmsley was convicted Wednesday of 33 counts of tax evasion
and related charges that carry three- or five-year prison terms.
   The judge will base his decision, in part, on a presentencing
memorandum by prosecutors, submitted shortly before sentencing,
outlining the facts of the case and including a recommendation for
sentence.
   The defense also submits a position paper and can provide letters
from friends and family in support of Mrs. Helmsley's character. At
the time of sentencing, she will be given the opportunity to make a
personal plea for leniency.
   So far, prosecutors aren't saying what their recommendation will
be. U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said after the verdict that it was
premature to discuss the sentence and he would not speculate on the
possibility of community service.
   But Harrison Goldin, the city comptroller and a Democratic
candidate for mayor, wrote to the judge Friday and suggested a
prison term, after which Mrs. Helmsley would be ``remanded, under
house arrest, to a New York City welfare hotel. ... She should be
required to manage the facility, as well as live there.''
   Figures from the Internal Revenue Service indicate that a
majority of criminal tax offenders are sent to prison.
   IRS spokesman Frank Keith said there were 2,619 convictions in
1988 for criminal violations of the federal tax law, including tax
evasion, fraudulent tax shelters, narcotics-related offenses and
false reporting.
   Of the sentencings last year, 1,590 tax offenders received prison
sentences, Keith said.
   A tax trial that Walker presided over in 1987 bears striking
resemblance to Mrs. Helmsley's, although the money involved was much
greater.
   The lead defendant, Schnejer Gurary, a wealthy garment center
executive, was convicted of similar charges for using phony bills to
claim $130 million in tax deductions over seven years. Mrs. Helmsley
was found guilty of disguising about $4 million in personal expenses
as business expenses in three years.
   Walker sentenced Gurary, who was 76 at the time, to three years
in prison and fined him $2 million. Mrs. Helmsley is 69.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gabrielle, which built quickly from a
tropical storm, churned Friday across the Atlantic toward the
Caribbean.
   ``It was a little faster than anticipated,'' hurricane specialist
Jim Gross, of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables, said after Gabrielle's quick rise to hurricane status.
   Gabrielle is the fourth storm to reach hurricane status in the
Atlantic season, which began June 1. It formed Thursday in the
eastern Atlantic.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle was centered near 13.5 north
latitude and 39.5 west longitude, or about 1,425 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles, moving slightly west northwest at 20 mph.
   The hurricane, which strengthened as it pushed away from the
African coast, had maximum sustained winds of about 75 mph with
higher gusts in squalls, forecasters said. There was little
strengthening Friday, but forecaster Gil Clark said Gabrielle could
get stronger as it moved into tropical waters.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Felix was expected to weaken again as
it drifted northward in the central North Atlantic.
   Its winds, which had dropped to 35 mph, below the 39 mph
threshold for a named storm Wednesday, picked up to 40 mph on
Thursday but were likely to drop back later Friday, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m., Felix was near 34.2 north latitude and 41.2 west
longitude, or about 650 miles southwest of the westernmost Azores
moving to the north at 5 to 10 mph. The depression was expected to
continue on this course Friday with a gradual turn to the northwest
on Saturday.
   Neither storm is an immediate threat to land, forecasters said.

<HEAD>Head of Covert Aid Operation Reportedly Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Intelligence Agency last month
removed the head of its task force directing aid to Afghan
resistance fighters after congressional critics complained about the
handling of the covert arms program, The Washington Post said
Saturday.
   The Post said CIA director William H. Webster decided to remove
the official after congressional supporters ofthe Afhgan resistance
complained to him about a slowdown in the flow of U.S. arms to the
rebels and questioned why arms were still being sent to anti-Western
fundamentalist groups.
   The official was formerly the agency's national intelligence
officer for the Middle East, an analytical job, and had little
experience in the CIA's operations division responsible for
purchasing and the shipping the arms, the newspaper quoted the
critics as saying.
   The Post did not name the official, saying that unnamed senior
CIA officials had asked the newspaper to keep his name confidential.
Webster still has full confidence in the official and the CIA might
use him in the future to work overseas under State Department cover,
the newspaper quoted the senior agency officials as saying..
   Among the critics questioning the shortage of arms being sent to
the Afghan rebels Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., respectively chairmen of the Senate's intelligence and
appropriations committees.
   Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., who heads a special Senate task
force on Afghanistan, told the newspaper that the CIA had ``gone to
sleep'' after the last Soviet troops left Afghanistan last February.
   Subsequently, Humphrey said, the supply of U.S. arms to the
rebels declined to half what it was the first half of 1988 at a time
when the Soviet Union was airlifting to the Kabul government massive
new arms shipments.

   A woman who suffered internal
injuries when she gave birth to an 11{-pound boy is suing a hospital
and two doctors, claiming they should have performed a Caesarean
section.
   Wilda S. Smith, 32, says she has undergone reconstructive surgery
and a hysterectomy and lost some bladder and bowel functions. Her
son, Kevin, was delivered without injury on Sept. 1, 1987.
   ``Her insides have been torn apart,'' Geoffrey Fieger, Smith's
attorney, said Thursday. ``She's still going through a lot of pain.''
   Obstetricians Harry Ludwig and Thomas Zima and Mount Clemens
General Hospital, in a suburb of Detroit, are named in Wednesday's
suit, which seeks at least $10,000.
   ``She had an ultrasound, and the doctors should have known how
big the baby was,'' Fieger said.
   William McCandless, attorney for the hospital and physicians,
declined to comment.

   Scientists counting fish from a submarine
made a bizarre find deep below the ocean surface: a sunken cow.
   Tory O'Connell, a biologist with the state Department of Fish and
Game, said she and the pilot of the two-seat submarine saw the
carcass for several seconds as they cruised about 20 miles west of
Baranof Island, 690 feet under the sea.
   The Sitka Sentinel sent a reporter to view the videotape the
scientists made of the scene, and he reported Friday that the object
did look like a cow. A Holstein, to be exact.
   On the tape, O'Connell can be heard counting off fish as the
submarine cruises along the ocean floor at 690 feet, the newspaper
reported.
   ``What the hell is that?'' pilot Don Slater asks as the object
comes into view. ``It's a cow,'' he concludes.
   The researchers did not offer theories for how the cow ended up
on the ocean floor. Its condition indicated it hadn't been there for
long, O'Connell said.

   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
has failed to deliver on promises to clean up a program riddled with
mismanagement, HUD auditors say in an internal report covering the
early months of the new agency administration.
   The audit praises at length program reforms ordered by new HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp but said the agency's field offices have been
slow to implement them, causing ``no visible improvement in the
system.''
   In another development, The New York Times reported that Deborah
Gore Dean, a key figure in the investigation of political abuse of
HUD programs, stated in a deposition that she had her office files
shredded as she was leaving her job as executive aide to Kemp's
predecessor, Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   ``I gave them to the Inspector General and had them shredded by
the Inspector General,'' Ms. Dean said in the April 1988 deposition,
the Times reported in its Saturday editions.
   Inspector General Paul A. Adams, HUD's chief internal
investigator, told the Times he did not know what Ms. Dean was
talking about and ``I can't imagine under what circumstances we
would do anything like that.''
   Federal agencies differ on their rules for saving office files
and there was no indication of any wrongdoing by Ms. Dean in her
handling of the documents, the Times said.
   Ms. Dean, Pierce's assistant from 1984 to 1987, gave the
deposition in a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago
which involved developers accusing HUD of reneging on an agreement
to renegotiate the terms of a mortgage on a large housing project.
   The HUD auditors' report program reforms on attributes part of
the problem to a lack of direction from HUD headquarters.
   ``Problems still exist and will continue to exist unless there is
a coordinated leadership drive by the various offices in
headquarters who are responsible for property disposition
activities,'' the auditors said in the report, which was obtained by
The Associated Press. ``This leadership and coordination was not
apparent during our review.''
   The audit was completed last week and covered the January-May
period.
   HUD officials on Friday said it was unfair to take the criticism
as a reflection on Kemp's leadership, noting that he did not come to
the agency until February and then had to assemble a management
team. HUD spokesman Jack Flynn said Kemp was not briefed on the
problems in the single-family home program until April and
immediately took steps to improve it.
   Among those steps was a June letter to HUD's regional directors
in which Kemp warned that their jobs would depend on improvements in
managing the program, under which HUD hires private closing agents
to handle property transactions.
   The audit referred to that letter as one of the Kemp
administration's positive steps.
   ``Your responses have been very positive and indicate that much
is being done to improve control over the handling of property sales
and related proceeds,'' said the report. ``Nevertheless, because
certain actions that were promised in connection with our previous
reports have not been implemented or are being implemented very
slowly, we are reopening our previous report findings.''
   The new report recommended tighter regulation of the closing
agents, including requiring them to obtain licenses and file
financial disclosure forms.
   The single-family program has received considerable attention
during the recent investigations of mismanagement, fraud and
influence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   A 1987 nationwide review of HUD's sales and acquisitions of
single-family properties found many private closing agents hired by
HUD were late in paying the agency millions of dollars _ and in some
cases weren't paying at all.
   Among the agents was a Maryland woman dubbed ``Robin HUD'' after
she said she kept more than $5 million that belonged to the agency
and gave some of it to charity.
   That audit blamed most of the problems on outdated accounting
systems and lax monitoring of closing agents. A dozen agents are
under investigation and several are being sued to recover money HUD
says is owed.
   Some new initiatives designed to tighten controls on the program
were established prior to Kemp's appointment and he has since
ordered other changes. The auditors praised the promises but said
HUD has been slow to translate them into action.
   The most serious transgression, the auditors said, was that some
field offices still aren't requiring closing agents to submit proof
that the money due HUD was wired to the agency.
   ``Delays in the submission of sales proceeds and sales packages
still exist and, in some cases, available evidence indicates that
large amounts of money have been misappropriated,'' the auditors
said.
   The report said HUD failed to meet a May target for establishing
a new automated accounting system for the program and that some
field offices aren't using a contract developed in 1987 that was
designed to make the closing agents more accountable.
   In only 155 of the 448 cases examined during the audit did HUD
receive its money on time. Of the late payments, 38 were made 20
days or more late.
   HUD loses interest when it receives late money, but the report
didn't estimate how much was lost because of the late payments
covered by the audit.
   The auditors reviewed eight HUD field offices and currently are
examining the administration of the program at several more.
   More than $370,000 was recovered from closing agents because of
the audit, but an Indianapolis agent still appears to owe the agency
$257,000, said the report, which did not identify the agent.
   At several of the eight offices some property files could not be
located, including 173 at the Denver ofice, where of the 298 files
reviewed only 43 contained records confirming that the sales
proceeds were wired to HUD, the report said.

   Brothers Jack and Charles Colbert did a lot
of washing in jail, but it wasn't clothes they were laundering, it
was postage stamps, the government says.
   An indictment announced Friday charges the Colberts washed
cancellations from the stamps and sold them at a discount in a
mail-order business they ran from the Somerset County Jail.
   ``They were just running a small business out of a jail cell,''
said Postal Inspector Walter A. Gilliland.
   The imprisoned pair could be sentenced to 39 additional years
each if convicted on charges of conspiracy, mail fraud and misuse of
postage stamps, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart J. Rabner.
   Officials said they caught on to the scheme in March after being
tipped off by potential customers.
   Jack Colbert, 37, and Charles Colbert, 42, originally from Mount
Vernon, N.Y., are serving 13-year federal prison sentences for 1986
convictions on mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy charges
stemming from a toxic waste disposal scheme in New York.
   The indictment says that while the brothers spent December until
June in the county jail awaiting trial on state toxic waste dumping
charges, they ordered canceled stamps in bulk.
   In one case, they allegedly sought to buy 110 pounds of canceled
stamps from a source the indictment did not specify. Bulk sales of
canceled stamps are advertised in stamp-collecting magazines.
   The brothers also wrote the March of Dimes asking for canceled
stamps, according to the charges.
   The Colberts offered to sell ``mint,'' ``ungummed'' stamps at a
75 percent discount in minimum $20 lots. The indictment did not
reveal how the cancellations were cleaned from the stamps.
   Gilliland would say only that corrections officers turned over
two empty shampoo bottles and a partly filled plastic container of
liquid laundry detergent taken from the Colberts' shared cell.
   Gilliland said the men were given extra mailing privileges
because of the complexity of the toxic waste charges they faced.
   ``I guess they kind of flim-flammed the officials at the jail,
saying they were making mailings out to defense attorneys and
businesses trying to formulate a defense,'' he said.
   The state dumping charges were dismissed in June and the brothers
have since been transferred to federal prison in Otisville, N.Y.

   President Bush and congressional leaders used
friendly get-acquainted sessions with Japan's new prime minister to
press his government to do more to relieve the pressures a $50
billion trade deficit places on the United States.
   ``We know that the health of our relationship partly depends on
bringing our economic relationship into better balance,'' said Bush,
who interrupted his Maine vacation Friday to meet with Toshiki Kaifu
for nearly three hours at the White House.
   At a South Lawn ceremony, Kaifu said Japan recognized that trade
imbalances were a cause of friction and said his country would
continue to ``make efforts for expanding imports.''
   At the same time, Kaifu said the United States must do more to
reduce its budget deficit, increase the rate of savings by Americans
and make U.S. industries more competitive.
   Bush pointedly told Kaifu, in office less than a month, that he
shared his belief ``that while Japan is noted as an exporting
superpower, the time has also come for Japan to be an importing
superpower.''
   Later, in a speech at the National Press Club, Kaifu said Japan
had helped create more than 200,000 U.S. jobs through direct
investment in the United States and criticized recent action by the
Bush administration to target Japan as an unfair trading partner.
   Invoking trade sanctions against Japanese products could have a
negative impact on U.S.-Japanese relations, the prime minister said.
   Kaifu employed a softer tone at the White House, declaring that
his country wants to remain a close U.S. ally.
   He said he proposed a joint U.S.-Japanese effort to combat
poverty and relieve world hunger to be called the ``Leland Memorial
Program for International Development'' to commemorate the late Rep.
Mickey Leland, D-Texas.
   Leland was killed in an airplane crash last month while on a
food-relief mission to Ethiopia.
   In a round of meetings at the Capitol, House Majority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., expressed encouragement over the
progress of U.S.-Japanese trade talks.
   ``For the first time we are not talking about specific items over
which we or they have a grievance,'' he said. ``We are talking about
the overall reasons why perhaps we have a problem getting products
into their markets.''
   But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said sweeping change
may be difficult to achieve.
   ``The Japanese government is facing a political test and I think
it's going to be a difficult period for them in terms of making
dramatic moves,'' Foley said.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas asked Kaifu to
consider further ways his government can aid Poland's new
non-communist government.
   ``I suggested ... they might take a look at investment
possibilities and other things they could contribute to Poland's
future,'' Dole said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said the Japanese
leader appeared to embrace his proposal to set up a joint committee
composed of members of Congress and the Japanese parliament ``to
explore ways to cooperate in dealing with global environmental
problems.''

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Withdraws Support of Drug Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan withdrew her
support for a planned drug treatment center and asked the 200 donors
who pledged $5 million to transfer the money to a foundation bearing
her name.
   Mrs. Reagan believed she was ``spreading herself too thin''
because she was becoming increasingly involved with her own
foundation, her upcoming book and charitable work on behalf of
cancer patients, her spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said Friday.
   The proposal drew fire from neighbors who complained the
treatment center would attract drug addicts and could increase
crime. The former first lady announced in May she would likely
withdraw her support for the center.
   The planned residential drug rehabilitation center at a vacant
hospital building was to have been operated by Phoenix House.
   ``This is a major disappointment to us,'' said Chris Policano,
spokesman in New York City for Phoenix House, a private foundation
that operates drug programs across the country. ``There had been no
prior dissension. It was a surprise.''
   Phoenix House notified donors of Mrs. Reagan's request, but also
informed them it believes it is legally obligated to use the funds
for a drug treatment center in the Los Angeles area.
   ``I don't think there's any legal obligation on the part of
Phoenix House, which received gifts, to forward them to any other
charity,'' said Assistant Attorney General Carole Ritts Kornblum,
who gave an opinion at the request of the drug treatment program.
   So far, three people who gave a total of $65,000 have asked that
their donations be returned or transferred, Policano said. Phoenix
House hasn't decided what to do with the donations, he said.

   U.S. officials say they are encouraged by
indications that many Latin American democracies are giving the
diplomatic cold shoulder to the new Panamanian government headed by
a loyal follower of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   At least six of the larger Latin American countries have no
ambassador stationed in Panama. But U.S. officials say some have
been ambiguous about the reasons for not being represented.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, a political appointee, left Panama
in May and President Bush said Friday that there are no plans to
send him back.
   Bush said no diplomatic contacts are planned with the new
government headed by President Francisco Rodriguez, a friend of
Noriega since high school who served as government comptroller for
seven years. Noriega will continue to serve as the behind-the-scenes
power in Panama.
   Among the larger Latin American democracies, only Mexico and
Ecuador have ambassadors in Panama, officials said. Among those not
represented at that level are Venezuela, Peru, Uruguay, Colombia,
Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
   The officials, insisting on anonymity, left open the possibility
that the recall of one or more of the ambassadors from these
countries was unrelated to political developments in Panama.
   The administration on Friday used the occasion of the appointment
of an unelected president in Panama to intensify its campaign
against Noriega.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler spoke disdainfully
of Rodriguez, who was named to replace his handpicked predecessor,
President Manuel Solis Palma.
   ``Noriega's latest puppet president is an unknown within Panama,
with no political following, whose chief qualification for the
position seems to have been his longtime friendship with Noriega and
his slavish loyalty to the dictator,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``Noriega's naming of a so-called `provisional government' is
completely outside Panama's constitution, and is, in effect, a
thinly disguised coup d'etat.''
   An elected president was to have taken office Friday but
Panamanian authorities threw out the results of the May 7 national
elections. The State Department has said an honest count would have
shown that the anti-Noriega candidate won by a 3-1 margin.
   ``This should have been a proud day for Panamanians and for all
who believe in self-determination and democracy,'' Bush said in a
statement. ``Instead, it is a sad day _ a sad day for Panama and for
the democratic nations of this hemisphere.''
   No new economic sanctions were announced by the administration,
but officials are studying the possibility of tightening sanctions
imposed against Panama last year.

   Israeli soldiers Saturday shot and killed two
Palestinian ``terrorists'' in the West Bank and earlier killed a
guerrilla in Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon,
the army said.
   Three other Palestinians were captured in the clash early
Saturday in Nablus in the occupied West Bank, the army said. No
further details were available in that incident.
   On Friday, Israeli troops clashed with several guerrillas in
Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon. An army
spokesman said one guerrilla was killed and two escaped.
   Security sources in Lebanon said a fourth gunman may have escaped
after being wounded in the clash.
   Military spokesmen said they did not know which militia the
guerrillas may have belonged to.
   During the fighting, two Soviet-made Katyusha rockets exploded in
northern Israel causing no damage, security sources said. The
rockets were apparently fired from outside the security zone near
the area of the clash.
   The clash occurred before dawn near the village of Beit Yahun,
six miles northwest of the Israeli border, said an Israeli army
spokesman, who requested anonymity in line with military regulations.
   The spokesman said the dead gunman carried a Soviet-made AK-47
assault rifle and large amounts of ammunition and plastic explosives.
   Later, soldiers showed reporters the body of the dead guerrilla,
who was wearing a camouflage uniform. The soldiers also showed three
Kalashnikov assault guns, two of which apparently belonged to the
escaped fighters.
   Israel created the security zone in 1985 as a buffer area after
withdrawing the bulk of its force following a three-year occupation.

<HEAD>Automaker to Pay $92,000 Penalty In Settlement With EPA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will pay the government a
$92,000 penalty for refusing to replace at no cost to its customers
alleged faulty emission control components on its cars.
   While contending that its warranty on the equipment is equal to
those offered by other automakers, Ford agreed Friday to pay the
penalty as part of an out-of-court settlement with the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   EPA last year cited the company for alleged violations of the
Clean Air Act for refusing to replace the components at no cost.
   The agency said it had received 23 complaints, all of which Ford
has agreed to settle. Also, Ford will reimburse about 500 other
vehicle owners who were denied warranty coverage for similar repair
work, EPA said.
   ``We feel that our warranty has been competitive with other
warranties available,'' Ford spokeswoman Joy Stinson said from
Detroit. ``But we have a high regard for the environment, clean air
... and if the EPA feels this additional coverage will assist in
that arena, we are certainly willing to cooperate with them.''
   The Clean Air Act requires motor vehicle manufacturers to design,
build and equip vehicles to comply with federal emissions standards
at the time of sale.
   ``Congress intended the warranty to cover any part which may
cause a vehicle to fail to comply with the federal emissions
standards,'' said William Rosenberg, EPA assistant administrator for
air and radiation. ``If we see a problem, we take action.''
   Warranties must cover emissions hardware for a vehicle's ``useful
life,'' defined as five years or 50,000 miles, the agency said.
   Ford's warranty limited coverage to emission control parts,
excluding other parts that ``significantly affect performance of
emissions components,'' EPA said.
   Among the parts not covered were intake manifolds, carburetors,
spark plugs and cylinders. Ford also excluded from its warranties
repair or replacement of fuel-injector pumps, air-cleaner-duct
valves and motors, ignition models and turbo chargers, all of which
can cause a vehicle to exceed federal emission standards, EPA said.
   The company's 1991 model year warranty will cover the additional
parts, Ms. Stinson said. Also covered will be eligible
emissions-related components that fail for any reason unless the
vehicle has been poorly maintained, improperly used or tampered
with, she said.
   The automaker will notify service personnel of the policy
changes, EPA said.
   Ms. Stinson said she did not know how much the settlement would
cost Ford aside from the penalty.
   Half of Ford's $92,000 payment will go to Colorado State
University for public education projects on clean-air issues such as
the emissions defect warranty, the company said in a statement. The
government will get the rest.

<HEAD>Government to Ban Alar Residues in Food in 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All foods containing residues of Alar, the
apple preservative that raised a national furor over possible cancer
risks, will be banned as of May 31, 1991, the Environmental
Protection Agency says.
   The agency said Friday that it saw no significant health risks
from eating apples or other food treated with Alar, but the ban is
designed to end use of the chemical in response to widespread public
fears about its safety.
   Uniroyal Chemical Co., the only domestic maker of Alar,
voluntarily agreed in June to take the compound off the market,
although it's still being exported. The company has disputed
laboratory findings that the chemical may cause cancer.
   The EPA reiterated that it plans to announce in January a ban on
the sale and use of Alar after it has received the final results of
several studies on the chemical.
   Until the ban becomes effective, Alar's use is still allowed on
apples, cherries, nectarines, peaches, pears, peanuts, grapes,
tomato transplants and ornamentals.
   But to discourage its use, the EPA said it would begin lowering
the amount of Alar residue permitted on domestic and imported apples
and other fruits Nov. 30, with a further reduction a year later and
a total ban effective May 31, 1991.
   For tomatoes, processed tomatoes, tomato pomace, meat and meat
by-products, milk and eggs, the ban will take effect Nov. 30 with no
phase-in period.
   Alar residues also are found in meat, milk and eggs because farm
animals eat fruit treated with the chemical.
   The EPA estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the U.S.
apple crop is treated with Alar, a growth regulator that improves
the apple's appearance and gives it a longer shelf life.
   The agency said Friday it believes the use of Alar on apples
declined over the summer because of Uniroyal's decision to stop
selling the chemical and a recommendation from the apple growers'
trade association to stop using it.
   Even so, the EPA said, any apples treated with Alar this summer
could fail to meet the new tolerance levels that take effect Nov. 30
and thus could be seized by federal agents.

<HEAD>Bennett Faults Some Existing Anti-Narcotics Trafficking Policies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Criticisms of U.S. foreign policy made by drug
czar William J. Bennett in the draft of his national drug strategy
have been deleted from the final version, an administration source
says.
   The draft of the international section, obtained by The
Associated Press, notes that some Andean nations face economic
instability and political insurgencies that could be made worse by
U.S. pressure to wipe out drug crops.
   ``In certain areas and circumstances, eradication may be the best
and most cost-effective approach to drug crop suppression,'' the
draft says.
   ``In others it can be self-defeating, driving farmers into the
ranks of anti-government insurgency movements, or displacing them to
other areas which cannot be easily reached.''
   The final version of the strategy, to be presented by President
Bush on Tuesday, won't include these statements, the source said.
   ``We thought that would not be an appropriate message to send to
the international community,'' the source said.
   What remains, the source said, is this statement from the draft:
   ``Careful case-by-case consideration must be given to eradication
programs for their potential effect on total country production,
their marginal cost benefit when compared to other counter-drug
programs in the same country or area, and for the political
consequences of their use.''
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ``That
doesn't cause us any problem, because that's something we would do
anyway. You want to look at eradication as a tool, not as an end in
itself.''
   The Peruvian government faces a threat from Sendero Luminoso
guerrillas, who have virtually taken control of the Upper Huallaga
Valley, the world's primary coca-growing region.
   The Colombian government, meanwhile, is under attack both by the
drug traffickers and the M-19 guerrilla group.
   Administration officials have testified before Congress that the
drug traffickers occasionally work with these guerrilla groups to
protect themselves from the government, but such alliances generally
are those of convenience, motivated by geographical proximity and
joint hostility to the government.
   Of the three main cocaine producing countries _ Peru, Colombia
and Bolivia _ only Bolivia faces no immediate threat from a
guerrilla organization.
   The draft also takes issue with U.S. diplomats' alleged failure
to stress the drug issue, something congressional critics have been
concerned about for years.
   The draft says that if the United States wants to broaden support
for its international counter-drug objectives, a ``vigorous,
coordinated public diplomacy program'' is essential.
   ``The nation's programs in this area are overshadowed by the
absence of importance given the drug issue as a foreign policy
concern,'' the draft strategy says. ``They remain unconvincing. This
situation is in urgent need of revision.''
   The draft also called for greater communication with the Soviet
bloc, including Cuba, on the drug issue.
   ``We must be prepared to share our knowledge and our concern with
the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations and be willing to
engage them in cooperative counter-drug activities,'' the draft
strategy says. ``And we should be prepared to take advantage of
special opportunities provided by other countries with which we may
have minimal or no diplomatic relationships ... to control drug
trafficking.
   ``This could, for example, include Cuba, which might effectively
block rather than facilitate the passage of drug-carrying aircraft
toward the United States,'' the draft says.
   A shortened version of this message remains in the final
strategy, the source said.
   Catherine Shaw, a spokeswoman for the State Department's office
of international narcotics matters, said the department already has
begun working more closely with the Soviet bloc on the anti-drug
issue.
   A letter of agreement with the Soviets signed in January by
then-Secretary of State George Shultz ``opens the door for technical
exchanges,'' Shaw said. ``That would mean we could help train
Soviets, when they seize drugs, to analyze it, exchange information
on cases.''
   The State Department has said it will be willing to work more
closely with Cuba on anti-drug measures only after Cuba proves its
interest in cracking down on the trafficking there, for example, by
seizing shipments of cocaine headed toward the United States.

<TEXT>
   A judge has denied a new trial for a woman who
said palimony attorney Marvin Mitchelson botched her divorce and
coerced her into having sex with him.
   A jury ruled Aug. 3 that Mitchelson had failed to properly manage
Felicia Gordon's 1984 divorce from her former husband, Robert
MacDonald. But the panel refused to award any money to Ms. Gordon,
saying it found no evidence of negligent or outrageous conduct.
   Superior Court Judge Jack Ryburn confirmed that finding without
comment Thursday.
   Ms. Gordon had sought $6 million.
   Ms. Gordon's attorney, Malcolm Ellis, claimed Mitchelson was not
prepared for trial, failed to appear at court proceedings and failed
to gather proper information on MacDonald's worth, estimated at
nearly $10 million. He said Mitchelson appeared in court once to
request a continuance and to present Ms. Gordon with a $250,000 bill.
   Ms. Gordon claimed in the civil suit that Mitchelson had coerced
her into a sexual relationship. She testified that during a visit to
Mitchelson's office, the attorney was wearing a robe with nothing
underneath and ``flashed'' her.
   The famed divorce lawyer denied all of Ms. Gordon's charges and
said she was well-represented by a colleague while he was bedridden
with a neck injury.
   ``It's a vicious, rotten lie,'' Mitchelson testified during the
trial. ``There was no affair. There was no solicitation of sex. She
has the wrong person.''
   Mitchelson had countersued Ms. Gordon for legal fees totaling
$127,716, but in a separate ruling the jury denied the award.
   The celebrity attorney gained fame in the 1970s as the attorney
who originated the term ``palimony'' when he represented Michelle
Triola in her lawsuit against the late actor Lee Marvin.

   Two months of investigation failed to explain
what happened to small amounts of the radioactive gas tritium that
may have been lost during shipment to two British companies, the
Energy Department says.
   The material is used in industry for certain research and for
making luminous lights, signs and dials, but its main purpose is as
an ingredient in nuclear warheads.
   Department spokesman Phil Keif said the agency is satisfied that
none of the missing material was diverted for illicit production of
weapons, although a government report released Friday said
investigators couldn't prove there was no diversion.
   Keif said that of the 5 grams of tritium that were missing when a
team of Energy Department and Nuclear Regulatory Commission
officials began searching in June, only a small fraction of 1 gram
has been accounted for.
   The discrepancies were discovered when the British companies
reported they got less than they ordered.
   The department usually sells about 200 grams of tritium to
commercial users a year, raising about $5 million annually.
Government information about tritium supplies is classified, but
independent experts estimate that about 4 grams is used in a single
atomic warhead as a means of boosting its explosive power.
   Commercial sales were suspended in July because of the
discrepancies. After revamping handling procedures, the department
decided Aug. 16 to resume sales to all customers except those for
which shipment discrepancies remained.
   Keif said the first sales, starting Aug. 25, were to E.I. du Pont
de Nemours &amp; Co.
   A new team of Energy Department tritium experts is pressing the
investigation, Keif said, but it has been unable to reconcile
discrepancies in shipments from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Tennessee to Surelite Ltd. and Saunders-Roe Developments Ltd.
   Tritium is produced in nuclear reactors at the government's
Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who has been investigating the
government's handling of tritium, Friday released copies of a
government report that said ``no reasonably certain explanation''
could be found for discrepancies in tritium shipments to Surelite, a
British subsidiary of Self-Powered Lighting Ltd. of Elmsford, N.Y.
   The report did not mention the amount of the discrepancies. It
said they could not be explained by measurement errors, losses
during processing, radioactive decay or by residue amounts of
tritium left in shipping containers.

<HEAD>Cancer-Causing Dioxin Found in Paper Milk Cartons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says paper
cartons can contaminate milk with cancer-causing dioxin, but at
levels too low to pose a health hazard.
   ``Milk is safe to drink,'' FDA Commissioner Frank Young said
Friday in announcing that the paper industry was changing its
manufacturing methods.
   ``But because we have the means to virtually eliminate even this
low level of dioxin, it is prudent to do so.''
   The FDA said its tests detected dioxin in milk at levels far
below 1 part per trillion in chlorine-bleached, polyethylene-coated
paper cartons.
   The FDA estimated the lifetime cancer risk would be less than one
in a million from consuming milk packaged in paper cartons over the
next three years to five years, even if all milk contained 0.01 ppt
of dioxin and 0.05 ppt of a related but less potent compound called
TCDF.
   The FDA said it would monitor the efforts of the paper industry
to modify production of bleached paper and paperboard so they
contribute virtually no dioxin to milk.
   Dioxin and TCDF result from reactions involving chlorine, which
is used to make paper white and to help break down lignin, a natural
material that binds the cellulose in wood.
   Red Cavaney, president of the American Paper Institute, said
about 75 percent of the paperboard for milk cartons is being
manufactured under the revised process. The rest is expected to be
brought under the new processing techniques within the next 18
months, he said.
   Processing methods also are being revised for paper used to
package other foods.
   Canada and New Zealand also have found their milk products to be
contaminated with very low levels of dioxin, the FDA said.
   The FDA's study stems from a national survey of dioxin begun by
the Environmental Protection Agency in 1983, an offshoot of which
found dioxin downstream from some paper mills.

<HEAD>Zoo Officials Losing Hope That Panda Will Survive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newborn giant panda cub was in grave
condition early today at the National Zoo hospital as veterinarians
and physicians battled to treat a potentially deadly infection,
officials said.
   ``It doesn't look too good at all, I'm sorry to say,'' Zoo
Director Michael Robinson said late Friday.
   ``The condition of the cub has worsened ... and it is now in a
rather grave condition. It has a fever, infection has increased and
we've had to put it in the equivalent of an oxygen tent.''
   Ling-Ling, a giant female panda, gave birth to her fifth cub
Friday morning. All of Ling-Ling's other offspring have died.
   Zoo officials said the 4-ounce female cub, taken from her mother
and placed in an incubator, was suffering from an abundance of white
blood cells and fluid in her lungs.
   Robinson said veterinarians and physicians were treating the cub
with glucose and antibiotics.
   If the cub does survive the immediate crisis, zoo officials may
have to raise her, something they say has never been done. Ling-Ling
may reject the cub if it is kept away too long.
   Several hours after the birth, zoo officials anesthetized
Ling-Ling and took the cub to give her a shot of immunoglobins
extracted from the blood of the father, Hsing-Hsing.
   Previously, officials had been careful not to separate the mother
from her offspring.
   The procedure to ensure a better immune system has been used on
other animals but never on pandas.
   After giving birth, Ling-Ling nurtured the cub by alternately
fondling it with her mouth and cuddling it with her massive arms.
The cub occasionally squealed, which is considered a good sign.
   The 250-pound Ling-Ling and her newborn were monitored through
closed-circuit television. Because Ling-Ling was keeping the tiny
cub pressed close to her body, it was almost impossible to see.
   The cub was born about 90 minutes after volunteers monitoring
Ling-Ling noticed she was having contractions, said zoo spokesman
Mike Morgan. Earlier in the day she was seen gathering more bamboo
in her nest.
   Pandas bear twins about 60 percent of the time, but zoo officials
said there were no immediate indications Ling-Ling was pregnant with
another fetus. Officials said Ling-Ling spontaneously aborted a
fetus in early August.
   The birth was the latest chapter in Ling-Ling's efforts to bear
offspring. In the 17 years that Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing have lived
at the zoo, the pair have had a variety of troubles mating and
delivering cubs.
   The first cub was born sickly and died three hours after birth.
In 1984, a second cub was stillborn, and in 1987 Ling-Ling had
twins. The smaller, weaker one died almost immediately and the
second lived about four days before dying of a generalized staph
infection.
   Pandas are endangered species. Fewer than 1,000 have been counted
worldwide.
   Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were given to the United States by the
Chinese government during President Nixon's visit to China in 1972.
   Ling-Ling is a pet name for Chinese girls and refers to the sound
made by the bells they wear on their wrists. Hsing-Hsing (pronounced
shing-shing) refers to the twinkling of a star.

   Blues harmonica great James Cotton has been
hospitalized and canceled all of his September performances, his
manager said.
   The 54-year-old, three-time Grammy nominee, known for his raw,
powerful, Delta-based blues sound, was to undergo surgery Wednesday,
said his manager, Gordon Kennerly.
   Cotton has been hospitalized for an ``air pocket,'' said
Kennerly, who further characterized the condition as a buildup of
gas in a body cavity. He would not elaborate Friday or say where or
when Cotton was hospitalized.
   Cotton's illness became known after he canceled an appearance
scheduled for Sunday at the Lake Tahoe Starlight Jazz Festival in
California.
   Kennerly said Cotton canceled all September engagements and
indicated later performances also might have to be canceled.
   Cotton, who also sings and plays guitar and drums, is one of the
best-known living blues performers.
   In the 1960s and 1970s, Cotton taught the late Paul Butterfield,
was invited twice to tour with the late Janis Joplin, and recorded
with Johnny Winter and Steve Miller. He ran away from home at age 9
to play with Sonny Boy Williamson and later played with blues greats
such as Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters.

   A judge waived a marijuana conviction for
U2 member Adam Clayton, in exchange for the rock bassist's agreement
to pay $34,500 to a charity.
   Justice Desmond Windle discharged Clayton, 29, on Friday. Clayton
was arrested Aug. 6 in the parking lot of a pub near his home. He
admitted to possession of marijuana and prosecutors later dropped a
charge that he planned to supply the drug to others.
   Clayton, who was accompanied to the hearing by U2 manager Paul
McGuinness and drummer Larry Mullen, refused to speak to reporters
outside the court.
   The fine will go to the Dublin Women's Aid and Refuge Center.

   The 50-year-old son of Art Linkletter was en route from Gualala,
about 100 miles north of San Francisco, to John Wayne Airport in
Orange County on Thursday when the engine on his Cessna 206
six-seater lost oil pressure and threw a rod, forcing the landing.
   The plane landed in a grassy field near the university, about 30

<TEXT>
   A new man wears the presidential sash in
Panama today but the old standoff between the United States and
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega continues.
   Francisco Rodriguez, a 50-year-old bureaucrat who has served
Panama's rulers for 20 years, was sworn in Friday by the head of the
Supreme Court as the leader of a provisional government.
   The brief televised ceremony was closed to the public and the
press, and Noriega did not attend.
   Rodriguez is Panama's sixth president since Noriega became head
of the Defense Forces in 1983 and, with that, the nation's de facto
ruler. Only one president was elected.
   The opposition, which last year mustered tens of thousands to
demonstrations, was quiet Friday. The day was declared a holiday and
the streets of Panama City were nearly deserted.
   In the only show of discontent, opposition leader Guillermo
Endara said through a spokesman: ``The fact that Gen. Noriega
handpicked another president doesn't change the political situation
of this country.''
   In Washington, reaction to Rodriguez's swearing in was harsh and
disdainful.
   President Bush threatened more sanctions and said the United
States did not recognize the ``illegal regime.'' His aides used
terms like ``puppet president'' and talked of ``rethinking'' the
canal treaties.
   The United States also did not recognize Rodriguez's predecessor,
Manuel Solis Palma, whose term as acting president expired Friday.
   Neither this nor a drug trafficking indictment against Noriega,
nor economic sanctions that have deprived his government of more
than $300 million, have budged the general.
   When the United States called him a drug-dealing dictator, he
seized on nationalist sentiments and claimed a Yankee plot to renege
on the treaties handing over control of the Panana Canal at the end
of the century.
   When international observers said the opposition slate headed by
Endara as the presidential candidate had won the May 7 general
election, the government annulled the balloting.
   The United States now hopes to end the 18-month standoff by a
more direct form of economic pressure.
   ``We can make it illegal for any U.S. firm or individual to deal
with any Panamanian company owned by an associate of Noriega or
Noriega directly,'' said a U.S. official in Panama who asked not to
be identified.
   Noriega is said to have extensive business holdings, and U.S.
officials said they expect to make public a blacklist of scores of
companies owned by Noriega or his associates by early next week.
   Rodriguez and a provisional vice president, Carlos Ozores
Typaldos, 49, were appointed by Panama's Council of State.
   The council said the provisional government might call new
elections if the United States releases Panamanian funds.
   Rodriguez, however, did not mention new elections in a nationwide
televised address Friday night.
   Like Noriega, he blamed Panama's political and economic
predicament on U.S. aggression. But his tone was conciliatory and he
called upon the United States ``to recognize that a policy of
kicking Panama around doesn't work.''
   ``We never have, nor are we, nor do we wish to be enemies of the
United States,'' he said.

<HEAD>Former Special Agents of the Army's Counterintelligence Corps Gather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The men meeting this weekend on the 50th
anniversary of World War II resemble a group of well-heeled
retirees, but their collective secrets could turn anyone's hair
white.
   The 120 former spycatchers were among more than 20,000 who
ferreted out spies and thwarted saboteurs from Europe to the Pacific
Theater for a secret agency: the Army's Counterintelligence Corps.
   They arrived in Boston last week, wearing tiny gold sphinxes as
tie clasps. Interviewed during their convention, many seemed to
shrink from the new light cast on their agency.
   Much of the secrecy surrounding the CIC, as former agents call
it, ended in 1983 after the capture of Nazi war criminal Klaus
Barbie in Bolivia and his extradition to France. A former agent went
public with the information that the CIC had used Barbie as a paid
informant.
   The resulting controversy is one that the former agents are
sensitive about. In fact, they're sensitive to just about
everything. None of the agents wore trenchcoats last week but
they're still on their guard. Some would tell war stories. Others
wouldn't even give their age.
   ``You people forget we were at war,'' said Jack Brockway, 75, of
Highlands, N.C., one of the 1,800 surviving CIC agents. ``It was
kill or be killed. I'm loyal to the United States. We had to pay
Barbie. He turned in a bunch of Nazis.''
   Among themselves, the agents swap the kind of stories that sound
as if they came out of Cold War-era potboilers.
   CIC agents were involved in the hunt for Japan's General Tojo,
the elaborate security surrounding D-day, and the Manhattan Project.
They also found and brought back to public life Konrad Adenauer, who
had been under house arrest by the Nazis, and who later became the
first chancellor of West Germany.
   Robert C. Ebaugh Jr. was 30 when he was used as a decoy for
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in December 1943. Allied leaders
meeting in Tehran had learned that German agents had parachuted into
the area to assassinate Roosevelt.
   Ebaugh, who bore a resemblance to Roosevelt, rode in the
president's car during the five-mile trip from the airport to the
city, wearing Roosevelt's hat and cape with a cigarette holder in
his mouth. Luckily, nothing happened.
   CIC agents were culled from the Army's finest, according to the
authors of a just-published book, ``America's Secret Army.'' Many
were lawyers, journalists and teachers. All had to be at least 24
years old and have an IQ of 120 or above.
   Among the onetime CIC agents who did not attend the convention
were former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and reclusive author
J.D. Salinger.
   The CIC had its origins in the Corps of Intelligence Police in
World War I, a counterintelligence group that all but died out after
the war. It was revived and renamed the CIC at the start of World
War II.
   ``We were all guinea pigs,'' said Brockway. ``There was really no
organized intelligence for us to go on. We did what we had to do and
made up the laws as we went along.''
   The CIC maintained a low profile during the war that contrasted
with its rival group, the OSS, or Office of Strategic Services that
was a forerunner of the CIA. From 1945 to 1947, during a period
between the demise of the OSS and start of the CIA, the CIC was
America's only intelligence organization abroad.
   CIC agents were recalled for the Korean conflict but the
organization was later merged with Army intelligence and died out in
the 1970s.

<HEAD>Fraternity Conference Begins Anti-Hazing Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that represents fraternities at 900
college campuses throughout the United States and Canada wants to
eliminate hazing, a practice that has led to 40 student deaths over
the past decade.
   ``Hazing has no place in the fraternity experience. It is a
dangerous form of intimidation that makes a mockery of fraternal
love and we're dedicated to eradicating it in the fraternity
system,'' said Jonathan Brant, executive director of the National
Interfraternity Conference.
   Brant said his group defines hazing as any action or situation
intended to produce mental or physical harassment, embarrassment or
ridicule.
   The National Interfraternity Conference, based in Indianapolis,
represents 59 major fraternities with 5,155 chapters and more than
400,000 student members in the United States and Canada.
   Brant said the conference had adopted an anti-hazing resolution
more than 30 years ago and that most fraternities have had rules
against hazing for the past two decades.
   ``We are painfully aware that in the past 10 years, more than 40
students have died and hundreds have been seriously injured by
student organizations in what have been referred to as
`hazing-related incidents,''' Brant said.
   The anti-hazing campaign will involve distribution of printed
materials on campuses, organizing discussion groups at fraternity
chapters and publishing articles in alumni magazines, he said.
   Fraternity pledging evolved in the late 19th century and was
meant to be a rite of passage for new recruits before their
initiation as full members.

<NOTE>Medicare Would Pay for Mammography Tests Under Proposed Rule</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medicare will pay for routine mammography tests
to detect breast cancer beginning Jan. 1 under a regulation proposed
by the government.
   Congress authorized Medicare coverage of mammography examinations
last year, making an exception to the law that prohibits Medicare
payments for routine physical checkups.
   One out of 10 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime,
according to medical experts, and elderly women have the highest
risk.
   The regulation, drafted by the Department of Health and Human
Services, was published in Friday's Federal Register. After 60 days
of public comment, a final regulation will be drafted.
   Under the law, Medicare will pay for mammography tests every two
years for women 65 and older. For younger women on Medicare because
of disability, the program will cover mammography tests annually for
those ages 50 to 64 and for women ages 40 to 49 who are at high risk
of developing breast cancer. It also will cover the exams every
other year for those ages 40 to 49 who are not at high risk and will
pay for one exam for those ages 35 to 39.
   Coverage of mammographies is expected to cost $150 million in
fiscal year 1990 and $275 million in fiscal 1991.

<NOTE>Washington Mayor Complains to Thornburgh About Leaks</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry wants to meet with Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh about media reports that federal
investigators have been told the mayor smoked crack on several
occasions.
   Barry said in a letter to Thornburgh on Friday that disclosures
concerning the Justice Department's investigation into his links
with convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis have damaged his ability to
govern.
   He said he hoped Thornburgh would follow U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens' request for a full investigation into the disclosures.
   David Runkel, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, refused
Friday to comment directly on the mayor's request, but indicated
that an inquiry is standard in such cases.
   Stephens declined to comment on whether Lewis has implicated
Barry, but said he wants the Justice Department to investigate
whether stories about Lewis' cooperation originated with law
enforcement officials.
   Local television stations and newspapers have reported that Lewis
told investigators he smoked crack with Barry in Lewis' hotel room
in December and that federal investigators have said they believe
they have enough evidence to seek an indictment of Barry on perjury
and obstruction of justice charges.
   For the past several years, Barry has been dogged by rumors that
he uses drugs. On Thursday, he said again that he never saw or used
drugs during at least six visits to Lewis' room.

   The Fairmont Hotel is closing its Blue Room,
an elegant supper club where Marlene Dietrich, Lena Horne, Ethel
Merman, B.B. King and others performed for more than half a century.
   No formal announcement will be made. The Blue Room simply won't
reopen as scheduled Tuesday after a two-month summer closing, said
hotel spokesman John DeMers.
   Private parties and Sunday brunches will be held in the 300-seat
nightclub, a victim of changing times and changing tastes in
entertainment, said Anton Piringer, executive vice president of the
five-hotel Fairmont chain.
   ``We found ourselves in a position where we were no longer able
to attract the quality entertainers we would very much have liked to
feature,'' he said. ``We were competing with concert halls,
auditoriums and stadiums, where entertainers had an opportunity to
earn many times what we had to offer.'
   DeMers said the Blue Room had been hurt by changing lifestyles.
New Orleans residents aren't as keen as they once were to dress up
and head down to Canal Street after dark. Some recent shows had
audiences of only two people.
   The Fairmont was offering performers $7,000 to $8,000 a week _
far below the $30,000 Ella Fitzgerald commanded, DeMers said, and
weekly losses were as high as $20,000.
   Glenn Miller, Guy Lombardo, the Dorsey brothers and rhumba king
Xavier Cugat played the Blue Room.Joe E. Lewis was a frequent
headliner and Lena Horne observed her 60th birthday with a 1977
engagement. Marlene Dietrich made one of her last public appearances
there in the mid-1970s, retreating between songs to gulp oxygen from
a tank.
   A local dance band called Pilot, which closed July 2, will be the
Blue Room's last act.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Revels in Parade, Promises Aid to Revolutionaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi reveled in a huge
parade marking the 20th anniversary of his seizing power and
promised revolutionary movements around the world that Libya will
not abandon them.
   Speaking during the Friday festivities, Gadhafi singled out
Panama for support in its struggle with the United States and
declared Israel's existence illegal.
   The Libyan leader, who has taken pains in the past year to appear
more moderate, nonetheless declared that his revolutionary ideas
were spreading in the South Pacific and said he would back ``freedom
fighters'' in Central America.
   Gadhafi capped the daylong anniversary celebration with an
evening parade in central Green Square. The colonel, dressed in
olive fatigues, was mobbed by hundreds of admirers as he arrived.
   Surrounded by Arab and African leaders, he gazed approvingly from
a platform as units of Libyan and foreign soldiers marched by.
   They were followed by other groups, including rifle-toting Libyan
women in long green dresses and European environmentalists sporting
blue-and-white baseball caps with pictures of Gadhafi.
   Gadhafi overthrew pro-Western King Idris on Sept. 1, 1969, and
established his own brand of radical socialism. His relations with
the United States deteriorated, and Washington bombed Tripoli and
Benghazi on April 15, 1986, in retaliation for what it called
Gadhafi's support of terrorism.
   The attack came 10 days after a bomb explosion at a West Berlin
discotheque killed two and injured 200. The United States accused
Libya of involvement in the attack on the club frequented by U.S.
soldiers.
   Gadhafi promised Friday to continue to aid ``freedom fighters''
around the world.
   ``I stand with you in the trenches,'' he told a special session
of the General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, which was
attended by foreign delegations.
   Gadhafi condemned former President Reagan, who ordered the
bombings of the Libyan cities; the attacks reportedly killed 41
people, including Gadhafi's baby daughter.
   ``The conquerors who believed that they made themselves divine on
this planet ... Alexander the Macedonian, Hitler, Mussolini and
Reagan, are in the dustbin of history,'' he said, according to an
official translation.
   He said Libya would offer ``supplies and support'' to
revolutionary movements around the world.
   ``We delightedly announce here to all freedom fighters in
Nicaragua, Panama, New Caledonia, Reunion, Mayotte, South Africa,
Namibia, Palestine, Caledonia, French Guyana and in Central America,
we happily announce to them that your ally is becoming stronger and
will not abandon you. We will be victorious.''
   Gadhafi singled out Panama, saying the United States was
demanding he withdraw his support for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as
a precondition for resumption of U.S.-Libyan dialogue.
   ``Libya is present in Panama, the Sept. 1 revolution is present
in Panama,'' Gadhafi said. ``We say this: We will not withdraw our
position, which fully and absolutely supports the cause of the
people of Panama in confronting American imperialism.''
   He said the United States also wanted Libya to recognize Israel.
   ``There is no question of recognizing Israel,'' Gadhafi said.
``The Zionist entity is a strange entity left over from World War II
that must be removed ... Palestine is for the Palestinians.''
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua told the assembly that
Gadhafi had supported the Central American country in its conflicts
with the United States.
   ``I owe him so much,'' the leftist Sandinista leader said,
according to an unofficial translation of his comments in Spanish.
   The celebrations were attended by at least 19 heads of state and
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, who was
seen chatting amiably with his old enemy, President Hafez Assad of
Syria.
   The array of guests testified to Gadhafi's efforts to improve
relations with his North African neighbors. On the eve of the
festivities, officials announced that Libya and Chad had signed an
accord formally ending 16 years of war over the mineral-rich Aouzou
border strip.
   There had been reports that Gadhafi also would host a summit of
the five North African states trying to form an economic union, but
the meeting apparently did not come off. The countries are Libya,
Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania.

   The United States will ship two C-130 B cargo
planes to Colombia on Sunday as the beginning of a $65 million aid
package to assist the South American nation's fight against drug
traffickers.
   ``The equipment will be shipped in a sequence designed to allow
the Colombian military to begin to use what we send them
immediately,'' Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Friday at a
news briefing.
   Williams said the medium-range C-130s would be flown from
National Guard bases in Louisville, Ky., and Martinsburg, W.Va. Both
will carry spare parts.
   On Monday, eight A-37 jet planes will be flown to Colombia from
Air National Guard bases in Illinois and Michigan. The following
day, five UH-1H transport helicopters would be ferried down in a C-5
cargo plane from a still undetermined base.
   ``The first equipment to arrive will be that with which the
Colombians are most familiar, allowing their forces to move this
equipment to those locations where it is most needed,'' Williams
said.
   President Bush said the aircraft and future shipments of U.S.
weapons to Colombia will be used to ``bring to justice those
responsible for the scourge of drug trafficking.''
   Colombia's government is now engaged in an unprecedented
crackdown against drug traffickers following the assassination two
weeks ago of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan. In response,
Colombian drug lords have declared ``total and absolute war'' on the
government.
   Williams said an undetermined number of bulletproof vests would
arrive with the helicopters as part of program to protect the
nation's judges and other court officials. Scores of judges have
been killed in the past two years and more than 100 judges have
resigned in fear since Colombia launched its latest offensive
against the drug cartels on Aug. 18.
   Ten American servicemen from the U.S. Southern Command's
headquarters in Panama arrived in Colombia on Thursday night to aid
the unloading, Williams said. He said he expected up to 100 Defense
Department personnel to take part in the operation.
   ``I would emphasize that we don't expect that they would all in
be in Colombia at the same time,'' he said. ``They will continue to
come and go as the training schedule and logistic support mission
demands throughout the duration of this mission.''
   There was no time limit on the training and it was not known how
long it will take, Williams said. He stressed that American troops
``will not participate in operations and will not accompany
Colombian personnel on anti-narcotics operations.''
   He said the Colombian government will be responsible for the
security of the American troops, adding: ``We do not anticipate that
U.S. forces will be in an area where security is less than
adequate.''
   Colombia and the United States reportedly were discussing the use
of U.S. tactical advisers, but Williams said that was ``still up in
the air.'' He said no decision had been made on whether to send U.S.
intelligence advisers there.
   Other U.S. items part of the shipment include trucks, small
boats, radios, troop support equipment, grenade launchers, machine
guns, rifles and pistols.
   The United States sent Colombia a list of equipment available for
immediate transfer from Defense Department stocks shortly after Bush
granted the aid. The Colombians, in turn, issued their list of
requests.
   ``It's been a matter of making those two lists marry up,''
Williams said. ``We are moving as quickly as we can.''

   Public TV stations won't be scared away from
the documentary ``Days of Rage: The Young Palestinians,'' despite
claims it's one-sided and may have been covertly funded by an Arab
group, a PBS official says.
   Twenty-five of the 26 major-market public stations will carry the
90-minute documentary Wednesday, Public Broadcasting System
spokeswoman Mary Jane McKinven said Friday.
   ``Days of Rage'' will be presented as part of a 2{-hour program
offering opposing views on the long and bitter Palestinian-Israeli
dispute in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   McKinven said she didn't know how many of the other 300-plus
public stations would carry the program.
   ``Controversy obviously is nothing new to public TV,'' she said.
``One of the reasons we exist is to do things others would not do.''
   TV critics and Jewish groups have said ``Days of Rage,'' produced
by Washington filmmaker Jo Franklin-Trout, is biased against Israel
in favor of the Palestinians.
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said the program was
``full of omissions, distortions and inaccuracies.''
   Franklin-Trout has accused PBS of caving into Jewish pressure and
reneging on several air dates.
   WNYC in New York canceled a planned June 5 showing, saying the
movie was ``pure propaganda,'' McKinven said.
   Controversy erupted again this week when an article by Steven
Emerson in the Sept. 18 &amp; 25 issue of The New Republic said the
Arab-American Cultural Foundation in Washington provided
``substantial funds'' to Franklin-Trout and her Pacific Productions.
   PBS guidelines prohibit editorial control or the ``perception''
of editorial control by a program funders, or promotion of products
in PBS-aired programs, McKinven said.
   PBS was trying to reach Franklin-Trout to discuss Emerson's
assertions, McKinven said. Franklin-Trout was in Europe on business
Friday, according to a recorded message on her telephone in
Washington.
   ``If we discover information that the funding was not what it has
been presented to be ... we would have to share that information
with viewers,'' McKinven said.
   PBS, which is getting ``Days of Rage'' free of charge, has the
option of rejecting programs in advance or not rerunning them if
covert influence is proved, McKinven said. Otherwise, viewers simply
will be informed of any such controversies and allowed to ``make up
their own minds.''
   Emerson said the Arab foundation agreed in May 1988, before the
film was made, to provide ``substantial funds'' after completion of
the project if it approved of the end result.
   Hisham Sharabi, a Georgetown University professor who heads the
Arab foundation, told The Washington Post ``the AACF furnished no
funds ... for the production of the film, the foundation had no
influence or control of any kind on the production of the film.''
   Sharabi confirmed Emerson's assertion that the foundation had
agreed to acquire distribution rights after the documentary aired.
   ``After we saw the film, in the fall of last year, we made a down
payment, or a partial payment, of several thousand dollars toward
the total of under $30,000,'' Sharabi said.
   Franklin-Trout has said she paid the $180,000 cost of the film
herself.
   Wednesday's program will be presented by WNET in New York under
the title of ``Intifada: The Palestinians and Israel.'' It will be
introduced by Hodding Carter, the former State Department spokesman
in the Carter administration, who will discuss the controversy.
   There also will be WNET-produced segments on Israel and the
Palestinian rights issues, as well as a panel discussion on ``Days
of Rage'' by Jewish and Arab representatives.

<HEAD>US Workplace Fatalities Seen Higher than in Other Major Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private group said today that a U.S. worker
is 30 times as likely to die on the job as a Swedish worker, but a
federal agency cast doubt on the comparison.
   The study by the National Safe Workplace Institute also said that
Japanese workers were twice as safe on the job as their American
counterparts.
   The organization compared figures on workplace fatalities for
seven major industrial countries: the United States, Sweden, Japan,
West Germany, France, Britain and Italy.
   ``Sweden had the best performance,'' the report said. ``If the
U.S. had that level of success, America would lose 300 men and women
from occupational injuries each year _ not the 10,700 lives that
were lost in 1986.''
   Roy Clason of the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration was critical of the report.
   ``If someone slips on the lunchroom floor and breaks his neck, we
count that as a work fatality,'' Clason said. ``I don't know if the
French do that.''
   Joseph A. Kinney, executive director of the institute, said he
derived his figures from the 1988 statistical yearbook of the
International Labor Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The
Chicago-based institute is funded largely by foundations.
   The figure of 10,700 lives lost in the United States came from
the National Safety Council, another private group in Chicago.
   ``There are no official figures,'' said Sy Holzman, staff
director of the House subcommittee on health and safety. ``That one
is the highest of three unofficial figures.''
   Peg Seminario, who handles health and safety for the AFL-CIO,
said Swedish employers ``spend about 25 times as much on safety per
worker as we do.''

<HEAD>Tammy Bakker Says Her Husband Was Humiliated; Should Not Be in Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUTNER, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tammy Faye Bakker says she can't understand
why the government imprisoned and humiliated her TV evangelist
husband, whose psychiatric episode she blames on an allergic
reaction to medicine.
   ``They strip-searched him in front of a room full of men and
threw him in a jail cell,'' Mrs. Bakker said after a six-hour
meeting with her husband, PTL founder Jim Bakker, Friday night.
``Jim said it was the most humiliating thing he had ever been
through.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter ordered Bakker to the Federal
Correctional Institution at Butner for psychiatric evaluation after
the evangelist broke down Thursday in the fourth day of his fraud
and conspiracy trial in Charlotte.
   The judge heard Bakker's psychiatrist, Dr. Basil Jackson, testify
that Bakker hallucinated when he left the courthouse Wednesday after
a witness fainted.
   Jackson said he prescribed the anti-depressant sedative Xanax for
Bakker but his condition worsened until Thursday morning he curled
up in a fetal position in his attorney's office with his head under
a couch.
   ``There is no reason at all for Jim to be in prison,'' Mrs.
Bakker said. Speaking of the medication she said: ``He just
literally had more than he could handle. I think Judge Potter is
being very unfair.''
   However, The Charlotte Observer today quoted Jackson as saying
the amount of medication Bakker had been given ``was infinitesimal
because I recognized his concern about overreaction.''
   According to the Physicians' Desk Reference, rare side effects of
Xanax, which is similar to Valium, include hallucinations, agitation
and other behavioral effects.
   Mrs. Bakker said her husband is ``very allergic to all
medication.'' She said, ``He doesn't even take aspirin.''
   She said her husband looked much more composed than he had
Thursday when he sobbed on his way to prison.
   Mrs. Bakker, a gospel singer who has co-starred with Bakker on
their talk-show style religious TV programs, said Bakker did not
fake his attack as skeptics have suggested.
   ``If you had seen Mr. Bakker, you would know he doesn't perform.
He's just Jim, not a performer,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bakker traveled from her home in Orlando, Fla., to visit her
husband. She said she would be visiting him daily and hoped he would
be able to resume his trial next week.
   When Potter dismissed jurors Thursday _ without telling them why
_ the judge said they would not be needed for a week.
   Government psychiatrists began evaluating Bakker on Friday, said
prison spokeswoman Sharon Orr. She would not characterize his mental
state or actions.
   ``Normally, an evaluation takes 30 to 45 days, but it has not
been determined at this time how long this particular evaluation
will take,'' she said.
   ``The initial process is a thorough physical. ... In the mental
health unit, a team made up of a psychiatrist and psychologist, the
psychiatric nursing staff, a case manager and a personal counselor
conduct the evaluation,'' she said.
   Mrs. Orr said Bakker has the option of wearing the standard
orange prison jumpsuit or street clothes. He also is free to roam
the grounds of the 700-acre prison, which houses about 800 inmates.
   ``That's his choice because he is not a convicted or sentenced
prisoner,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bakker said her husband described his room as having bars on
the window. He told her that his meals are pushed through a window
in the door and he has to wear handcuffs every time he comes out of
his room, she said.
   Butner is one of three federal prison hospitals in the nation
that do psychiatric evaluations.
   Bakker, accused of using nearly $4 million in ministry funds to
finance a lavish lifestyle, has previously acknowledged suffering a
nervous breakdown 20 years ago and considering suicide during a 1981
separation from his wife. Former PTL workers say Bakker was given to
frequent attacks of anger or depression.

<TEXT>
   Communist and Solidarity leaders joined to
mark the 50th anniversary of the Nazi invasion, and Pope John Paul
II called on all peoples to not use war to solve disputes.
   As Europeans commemorated the beginning of World War II Friday,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany expressed sorrow and regret
for the ``unspeakable suffering'' caused by the Nazis.
   In London, about 200 people gathered at the St. Pancras railway
station to remember their evacuation to the countryside to escape
Hitler's relentless ``blitzkrieg'' bombings.
   Rude Pravo, the Communist Party daily newspaper in
Czechoslovakia, called the conflict ``mankind's most terrible war.''
   Pope John Paul II participated in his homeland's ceremonies,
appearing on a large television screen overlooking Warsaw's Victory
Square in a broadcast from the Vatican.
   ``The memory of World War II, and the local conflicts that have
been going on for the past 50 years ... oblige all of us to persist
in the aim to eliminate war from all parts of the world, so it
ceases to be a tool for resolving disputes,'' the pontiff said in
his native tongue.
   The pope's speech was part of an international Day of Prayer for
Peace in Warsaw, attended by leaders of the Roman Catholic Church
and other religions. But Poland's only rabbi stayed away to protest
the presence of a Catholic convent outside the Auschwitz
concentration camp in southern Poland.
   On Friday evening, Leonard Bernstein conducted an anniversary
symphony concert at the Grand Theater.
   Solidarity leaders joined Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski
in a display of national unity at the Baltic port of Gdansk as the
country honored the small Polish garrison that the Nazis attacked on
Sept. 1, 1939, to start World War II.
   On one side of Jaruzelski was Solidarity leader Lech Walesa; on
the other was newly elected Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
longtime Solidarity adviser.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' said
Jaruzelski. ``Tomorrow, Poland must be stronger than today, through
its economic potential and most of all through mutual effort,
agreement and national reconciliation.''
   Sitting in the front row were 53 veterans of the legendary
garrison that endured the guns of the German warship
Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a determined infantry assault for
seven days.
   World War II killed more than 50 million people, including 6
million Jews exterminated by the Nazis. By the time the fighting
ended in 1945, the United States had forever changed warfare by
dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Kohl, in a speech to the West German Parliament in Bonn, singled
out the first nation to fall in the war.
   ``We seek understanding between the German and Polish peoples,''
he said. ``This is our duty and it accords with the yearning of both
nations.
   ``It is true that too many people in Germany and some abroad were
blinded and deceived by that tyrant,'' Kohl said of Adolf Hitler.
   ``Who among us can say with a good conscience that, confronted
with such evil, they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs?
And who among us can judge what it meant at that time to risk not
only one's own life but the lives of one's family as well?'' he
asked.

   Vietnamese boat people wielding home-made
weapons clashed today after an earlier brawl over a volleyball match
that involved betting, police said. One person was killed and 11
injured.
   In another development, officials said 4,000 boat people will be
evacuated from an outlying island because of a cholera outbreak.
   A police spokesman said 46 men were arrested after about 200 boat
people in the Shek Kong Camp fought among themselves early today
with sharpened objects, clubs and glass bottles.
   He said police found the dead man when they searched tents in the
crowded camp, where about 7,000 people live. The spokesman said he
appeared to have been hit on the head.
   Four of the injured were hospitalized, the police spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman said the unrest was linked to a Friday fight
involving 40 people over a volleball match.
   Some boat people gambled on the match, organized by the U.N. High
Commissioner For Refugees, but those who lost did not pay and a
fight ensued, leaving two injured, the police spokesman said.
   Clashes among Vietnamese boat people and with camp guards have
become increasingly common.
   In a fight Friday involving 30 people at the Lo Wu detention
center, a 19-year-old Vietnamese man injured. Police said a
23-year-old man was arrested in connection of the case.
   More than 55,000 Vietnamese boat people are staying in Hong Kong,
waiting to be repatriated or resettled. They are among an estimate 2
million Vietnamese who fled their homeland since communist forces
toppled the U.S.-backed government in South Vietnam in 1975.
   About 4,000 boat people living in primitive conditions on an
outlying island are to be evacuated following an outbreak of
cholera, a senior government official said Friday.
   Hong Kong's acting secretary for security, Alistair Asprey, told
reporters that the Vietnamese housed in tents on Tai A Chau island
will be moved next week to another island with better living
conditions.
   Five more Vietnamese boat people were confirmed to have been
stricken with cholera on Tai A Chau on Friday, bringing to 11 the
number suffering from the disease, a government statement said.
   The first case was detected Monday, a day after rioting broke out
when 1,000 Vietnamese hurled stones at police following a dispute
over rice distribution.
   Police said the rioters destroyed the health center and other
public facilities on the island.
   The government began to put boat people on Tai A Chau Island in
June in an emergency measure to cope with mounting arrivals. Boat
people usually stay there for about two weeks before they are
inoculated and moved to other detention centers, but the first three
cholera patients had stayed on the island for a month.

   A couple who participated in a triple wedding
during the the Great American Kiss-Off hope baby does not make three
before the contest is over.
   Menette and Jason Knapp, who were among three contestants who
married during the competition Aug. 26, are expecting their first
child Oct. 4.
   Menette Knapp said she recently had her first pre-natal
contraction. But she and her new husband plan to stay in the contest
as long as possible because they need the top $10,000 prize to help
pay the expected $5,000 baby delivery bill.
   ``Financially, winning is a must for us,'' she said during the
21st day of the contest Friday. ``But there's more to the Kiss-Off
than winning. It's definitely brought us much closer together
spiritually.''
   Under the rules of the radio station contest, being held in the
parking lot of the co-sponsor, a furniture company, couples must
kiss for 12 hours a day, between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., with five-minute
breaks allowed each hour.

<HEAD>Delta to Appeal Ruling that Blames Crew in 1985 Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREA WEISGERBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines officials say they will
appeal a ruling that faults the flight crew for a 1985 plane crash
that killed 137 people, including the three-member cockpit crew.
   U.S. District Judge David O. Belew on Friday blamed the crew of
Delta Flight 191 for the crash at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, although he acknowledged that air traffic controllers
failed to warn the crew of the severity of weather conditions at the
airport.
   The Atlanta-based airline said the ruling was in conflict with a
recent jury verdict in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that held Delta
blameless in the accident.
   Delta ``continues to believe that the facts surrounding this case
clearly establish total government responsibility for the tragic
accident,'' the airline said.
   The airline had sought to make the government pay all or part of
the millions of dollars in claims arising from the crash.
   Belew said Delta failed to prove that the two federal agencies
were negligent in the Aug. 2, 1985 crash of the Lockheed L-1011,
which was en route from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Twenty-seven
passengers survived the crash.
   ``The crew has seen lightning, identified a thunderstorm and has
encountered a performance increase (in air speed),'' Belew said.
``There was no explanation for continuing at this point. Every clue
the crew had received was worse than the previous one.''
   ``This sends a message to Delta Air Lines that the people who
control the operation of aircraft must be held to the highest
standards of care,'' said Roy Krieger, a former government lawyer in
the case who is representing clients suing Delta over the August
1988 crash of a Boeing 727 in Dallas.
   Hal Monk, a Fort Worth attorney representing some of the victims'
families, said, ``From my standpoint, the flight crew made a simple
decision to fly an airplane load of people into a thunderstorm.''
   Delta argued in the 14-month trial that government meteorologists
and air traffic controllers failed to warn the crew of the severity
of the weather. The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that
the crash was caused by wind shear _ a dangerous downdraft of air
associated with severe thunderstorms.
   Delta already has paid $66 million in damages as a result of the
case. In those cases, the plaintiffs waived the liability issue.
Sixteen families are continuing to sue Delta over the crash.
   The government did not escape criticism in Belew's ruling, which
cited the responses of controllers and meteorologists.
   Belew said tower personnel should have made sure that incoming
pilots were aware of weather conditions, and that a meteorologist
should have been sure that the weather was being monitored
continuously while he took a long dinner break.
   But Belew cited other cases in which the controller's failure to
warn pilots of bad weather was not characterized as negligence.
   James Dillman, attorney for the Federal Aviation Administration,
said the controllers would be briefed on the ruling, but that no
formal disciplinary action will be taken.
   In Washington, Joe Friday, assistant administrator for weather
services at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
said: ``We are continuing to work with the FAA and the aviation
industry to improve our science and technology so that this kind of
tragedy will not be repeated.''
   Belew discounted the government contention that Delta had not
adequately trained pilots to handle wind shear situations. He called
Delta's training ``lax'' but not a factor in the accident.
   The judge also ruled out the possibility that tranquilizers Capt.
Edward M. Connors might have been taking at the time of the accident
contributed to the crash.
   Pilot error also was cited as a cause of a Delta crash in 1988,
which killed 14 people. The airline has accepted responsibility for
that crash and fired the flight crew after it was determined that
the flaps were not set in the proper position for takeoff.

<HEAD>Central Committee Rejects Withdrawing Communist Party From Workplace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party's senior officials
rejected a leading reformer's call to end party activity in the
workplace but said other political groups can also participate, the
official news agency said today.
   The rejection was considered a setback for the reformer, Imre
Pozsgay, who was expected to attend a two-day congress of
like-minded Communists opening today.
   At a party Central Committee meeting Friday, members agreed the
party ``should not interfere with company matters'' the news agency
MTI quoted party spokesman Laszlo Major as saying.
   While the majority of committee members were against complete
withdrawal from the workplace, most agreed ``the opportunity for the
appearance of the other political forces should be made possible,''
Major said.
   A party source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said less
than 20 of the Central Committee's 113 members had been asked to
attend today's meeting of reformers, indicating that less than a
sixth of the party leadership was fully committed to change.
   Pozsgay is the party's candidate for president in elections next
year. The post is being created as part of reforms aimed at creating
a multiparty democracy in Hungary.
   The Central Committee meeting was called in part to review
preparations for a full party congress starting Oct. 6. The meeting
is expected to pit hard-liners against reformers over the party's
future course.
   The reformers have said they will form a social democratic party
unless most of their views are adopted at the meeting. Their demands
include implementation of a market economy.

<HEAD>Labor-Managment Bid Offers $6.5 Billion to Control United Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A labor-management proposal to buy UAL Corp. for
$6.5 billion would put the workers in the corporate cockpit of
United Airlines in the nation's largest employee-owned company.
   British Airways would come on board as a minority owner of the
company in an arrangement that would put the heads of each airline
on each other's board of directors.
   While United's directors were pondering the offer of $300 a share
Friday, there were reports that investor Marvin Davis was
considering topping the offer.
   The Machinists union, which has opposed past employee ownership
schemes, did not say whether it plans to join the current venture.
   ``The Machinists are a major issue. ... They're a potential
killer to the deal,'' said Andrew Geller, a financial analyst who
watches the airline industry for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia.
   UAL directors said Friday they were reviewing the proposal.
Davis, a California investor, started the bidding on the airline and
earlier had made an offer of $275 a share, or $6.19 billion.
   Jim Damron, a spokesman for United's unionized pilots, said there
has been constant contact with the Machinists, but he would not say
if that union had moved any closer to joining an employee-ownership
plan first suggested by pilots in 1987. Telephone calls to the
Machinists offices went unanswered.
   United has more than 70,000 employees, including about 25,000
members of the Machinists union, 6,300 members of the Air Line
Pilots Association and 12,600 flight attendants.
   The flight attendants' union has said it wants to participate in
the deal.
   Mary Conway, a spokeswoman for Davis, said ``he and his advisers
are studying the situation.'' She refused to comment further.
   One industry analyst said he believes the battle for UAL is
``basically a two-horse field'' with the management-employee group
having the edge over Davis.
   ``It would be awfully hard to see someone else come in at this
point and make any money acquiring United without liquidating (the
airline's) assets,'' said Louis A. Marckesano, an analyst with
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   Some have suggested that Davis started the bidding war to jack up
the price of United's stock, of which he is a major owner. Others
say Davis really wants to buy the company.
   ``I'm more from the former school,'' said analyst Geller. ``He
could make enormous profits, but we'll know in a few days.''
   UAL stock, which was trading at about $90 a year ago, soared
$13.50 to $166 on July 9 in a buying frenzy on takeover talk. The
price went to $210.75 when Davis put in his first bid and on Friday
it jumped $7.25 and closed at $287 on rumors of the labor-management
offer.
   Under the proposal, British Airways would control 15 percent of
UAL stock. The employees would agree to unspecified wage concessions
in exchange for participation in a stock ownership plan that would
give them 75 percent of the airline.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf said that under the proposal, the
owners did not contemplate selling any essential assets or revising
plans for expanding the airline fleet and routes.
   British Airways said it has agreed in principal to invest $750
million in the consortium. Earlier unconfirmed reports indicated
that the pilots' union might invest as much as $1 billion. The rest
of the buyout funding apparently would be borrowed.
   The largest U.S. company owned by its employees is Avis Inc. An
employee stock ownership plan representing 11,000 Avis workers took
the car rental company private in a $1.75 billion buyout in 1987.

<HEAD>Texas School Challenges Ban on Prayer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARFA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 high school football season began
with a prayer despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding a ban on
such invocations in three Southern states.
   ``You bet we're going to have a pre-game prayer,'' Marfa coach
Dub Polson said before Friday's game against a team from Eunice,
N.M. ``As long as we're supposed to be a God-fearing nation, I think
we'll always have a prayer.''
   The Supreme Court in May refused to review an 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruling that banned organized prayer before football
games in Florida, Georgia and Alabama. The court ruled organized
prayers delivered over a public address system violated the
constitutional amendment requiring separation of church and state.
   The pre-game prayer at Marfa, a west Texas community of about
2,500 people, was recited without incident. It was the first in the
state since the court ruling.
   Prayers before games in Alabama and Florida in defiance of the
court ruling prompted some protests last weekend.
   Polson said the schools in District 5-2A voted unanimously
Thursday at the league's pre-season meeting to hold invocations
before each athletic contest.
   Marfa School Superintendent Carl Robinson said the Texas
Education Agency has not issued a directive concerning pre-game
prayers.
   ``We look to the TEA for direction,'' he said. ``We have always
been in compliance with the law and to my knowledge, there is no law
in the state prohibiting prayer before a game ... or any activity
for that matter.''
   The superintendent also said no one has objected to the tradition.
   ``I think most people appreciate the opportunity to have a moment
of prayer ... whether it's a parent thinking about a child or the
child in the stands or on the football field,'' Robinson said.
   Marfa lost the game 34-0.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Strike Oklahoma; Rain Dampens New England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms broke out in humid air in Oklahoma ahead of a cold
front that was slowly pushing southward into the southern Plains and
the lower Mississippi Valley today.
   In Oklahoma County, intense thunderstorm winds snapped off a
utility pole and blew down a tin building Friday night. A man was
injured when several large pieces of wood were thrown into his
mobile home by the wind.
   Strong thunderstorm winds also toppled a large tree and blew a
truck off a road in Canadian County, Okla. Thunderstorms also
produced golf ball-size hail at Shawnee, where winds gusted up to 70
mph. Nearly 4 inches of rain fell at Edmond, Okla.
   Elsewhere, showers, drizzle and fog extended from the middle
Atlantic Coast into New England. Fog also developed over southwest
Kansas and covered much of the eastern Gulf Coast, the southern
Atlantic Coast and Florida.
   An upper air low pressure system off the coast of Washington
state caused showers and some thunderstorms to be scattered from the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies.
   An area of high pressure over North Dakota produced clear skies
and cool temperatures from the upper Great Lakes to the central
Rockies.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included nearly 2{ inches at Vero Beach, Fla., more than 1} inches
at Homestead, Fla., and 1{ inches at McAlester, Okla.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over
Florida, the eastern Gulf Coast, Arkansas, the Tennessee Valley and
the middle and southern Atlantic Coast; scattered showers and
thunderstorms over eastern New England and the northern Rockies; and
strong winds over parts of the central Rockies.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s in New England, the
northern Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley,
the northern Rockies and the central and northern Pacific Coast; in
the 100s in the desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 92 degrees at Phoenix and Glendale,
Ariz.

<HEAD>Fugitive American Drug Dealer Captured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's immigration chief
announced today that a fugitive American drug dealer had been
captured and said the Philippines will not be a refuge for foreign
criminals.
   ``This nation must be known for its positive attributes, not for
the safety and protection facilities it might offer alien
criminals,'' Bienvenido Alano Jr., chairman of the Commission on
Immigration and Deportation, said in a statement.
   Alano said immigration agents arrested Robert Otto Rosenthal
Friday at a house on the outskirts of Opol, a town in Misamis
Oriental province, about 540 miles southeast of Manila.
   Rosenthal, 51, was charged in the U.S. District Court of the
eastern district of Missouri last March with transporting cocaine
from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to St. Louis on five occasions between
September 1987 and November 1988, records showed.
   The U.S. Embassy had canceled Rosenthal's passport and he was to
be deported today, Alano said.
   The statement did not say how long Rosenthal had been in the
Philippines, and details about his hometown and state were
unavailable.
   Alano said immigration agents will concentrate on arresting
foreigners belonging to syndicates involved in drugs, prostitution,
gun smuggling and fake travel documents.
   Rosenthal's arrest followed raids on the island of Cebu and in
Manila.
   In Cebu island, two West Germans were arrested Friday on charges
they were members of an international drug syndicate, said Danilo
Almeda, regional immigration chief.
   Almeda said agents seized a half pound of marijuana from Markos
Manfred Riedel, 26, and Wolfgang Christian Gerhard Kuhn, 32, during
a raid on a house in the village of Liloan, about 390 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Riedel and Kuhn were to be flown to Manila to face deportation
proceedings, authorities said.
   Almeda said authorities were investigating whether yachts were
being used to smuggle marijuana from Cebu to foreign countries. The
Germans arrived in Cebu by yacht last March, authorities said.
   In Manila, Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao of the Philippine
Constabulary said Tan Kong Chow and Yan I Ning, both of Taiwan, were
arrested Monday in Manila on suspicion that they are also members of
another foreign drug syndicate.

   A judge released on bond two alleged members of a
mob involved in the death of a black youth, and angry supporters of
the youth's family clashed with a defense attorney and members of
the news media.
   The alleged ringleader of the mob, Joseph Fama, was ordered held
without bail Friday after he pleaded innocent to charges he shot and
killed 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins.
   Prosecutors said Fama led the gang of up to 30 whites who
attacked Hawkins and three other black teen-agers in the Bensonhurst
section of Brooklyn on Aug. 23. They said Fama shot Hawkins four
times at close range.
   Fama fled after the shooting and was a fugitive until he
surrendered Thursday to police in Oneonta, 175 miles north of New
York. He was returned to Brooklyn, where witnesses identified him in
a lineup, said Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns.
   Fama's attorney, David A. DePetris, entered an innocent plea on
behalf of his client, charged with murder, assault, criminal
possession of a weapon, menacing, riot and aggravated harassment.
   The killing led to a week of protests and heightened racial
tensions in the city. Hours after Fama was returned to Brooklyn on
Thursday, those at the head of a protest march involving an
estimated 8,000 people clashed with officers at the foot of the
Brooklyn Bridge. Two protesters and 44 officers were injured, police
said.
   Six other Bensonhurst youths have been arrested in the attack,
and two of them _ Keith Mondello, 19, and Pasquale Raucci, 18 _ have
been indicted on murder charges.
   They pleaded innocent at an arraignment Friday and Justice John
J. DeLury allowed Mondello freed on $100,000 bail and Raucci on
$75,000 bail.
   That decision outraged Hawkins' family and their supporters.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to the Hawkins family,
interrupted an interview that reporters were conducting with
Mondello's lawyer, Stephen Murphy, and called him a murderer.
   ``We're going to get you this time, Murphy,'' Sharpton screamed.
``We'll see you tomorrow in Bensonhurst.''
   A few minutes later, outside the courthouse, a Sharpton supporter
attacked a WNYW-TV camera crew that was taping the Hawkins' family.
   Station spokeswoman Barbara Ware said technician Barbara Lloyd
was treated for back injuries and cameraman Nick Jutchenko for
multiple injuries. The two said they would file a complaint against
the attacker.
   New York Newsday photographer Lilliana Nieto also was attacked by
the group while she took photographs of Ms. Lloyd being attacked.
She said Sharpton yelled ``Get her'' and someone smacked her in the
face and head.
   Sharpton later telephoned the television station and apologized
for the attacks.

<TEXT>
   Nine longtime members of the sheriff's
narcotics division have been suspended after auditors found cash
missing that was seized in drug raids.
   ``It's the first time anything of this magnitude has been
suspected in this department,'' Sheriff Sherman Block said Friday at
a news conference announcing the suspensions.
   Block refused to say how much money was missing or whether it
disappeared at one time or over several drug busts. No one has been
arrested or charged in the investigation, which is continuing, Block
said.
   The Los Angeles Times today quotes a federal official the
newspaper did not identify as saying: ``We don't know the full
amount of money at this time. It could run into a couple of hundred
thousand dollars.
   ``The money was not getting to the evidence vault. I think they
took a little each time rather than a major amount.''
   FBI agent Lawrence Lawler confirmed the money was missing from
cash confiscated during drug busts, saying, ``It never reached the
evidence locker.'' He would not provide other details.
   The suspensions with pay of the eight deputies and one sergeant,
resulted from a federal investigation prompted by a routine audit in
October 1988, Block said.
   The nine narcotics division members, who worked together as a
team, had spent nine to 22 years with the department.
   ``Since the people work as a team, the entire team was placed in
administrative leave,'' Block said.
   ``Let me assure you that this incident involved a very small
number of the 10,700 dedicated people in the department, '' Block
said. ``Let me also assure you that I will not tolerate the
corruption of even one of the department's members.''

<HEAD>Mormon Church Excommunicates First Indian General Authority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mormon Church excommunicated the only
Indian to achieve a high position in its hierarchy after he acused
church leaders of racism and said the president was too feeble to
make decisions.
   The excommunication of Elder George P. Lee was announced Friday
in a terse, one-paragraph statement. Lee's excommunication is the
first of a Mormon Church general authority in 46 years.
   The communique said Lee was expelled for ``apostasy and other
conduct unbecoming a member of the church.'' Church spokesman Don
LeFevre would not elaborate on the statement.
   Lee said the action stemmed from basic doctrinal disagreements
with church leaders about the role of American Indians in the
religion and from his contention the leadership is racist,
materialistic and bent on changing the meaning of Mormon scripture.
   ``It got to the point where I had to follow them or Jesus Christ,
and I chose to follow Jesus Christ,'' Lee said in an interview. ``I
told them they are the ones that are apostatizing _ teaching false
doctrine.''
   Lee, 46, was made a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy in
1975. The leadership group is responsible for administering the
affairs of the 6.7 million-member church under the direction of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the church presidency. Members of
the all-male leadership are known as general authorities.
   In an hourlong meeting with church President Ezra Taft Benson,
Benson's two counselors and the twelve-member quorum, Lee read a
23-page, handwritten letter in which he accused fellow churchmen of
distorting doctrine to satisfy their own racial bias, relegating
Indians to second-class status and denying them their rightful place
in the faith's theology.
   ``While physical extermination may have been one of (the) federal
government's policies long ago ... your current scriptural and
spiritual extermination ... is the greater sin and great shall be
your condemnation for this,'' Lee wrote.
   The church believes American Indians are the descendants of
ancient peoples described in the Book of Mormon, published in 1830
by church founder Joseph Smith.
   Lee said prophesies in the Book of Mormon are clear in defining
Indians and Jews as literal descendants of the House of Israel and
all others as ``gentiles,'' or ``adopted Israel.''
   In recent years, Lee said, general authorities have been
preaching that non-Indian members are literal descendants of
Ephraim, a grandson of Israel in the Old Testament, thereby giving
non-Indian Mormons an excuse to ignore their Indian brothers.
   ``This type of teaching encourages an attitude of superior race,
white supremacy, racist attitude, pride, arrogance, love of power
and no sense of obligation to the poor, needy and afflicted,'' Lee
wrote.
   He questioned whether other general authorities would remain
committed to the church if they were not given membership on
corporate boards, royalties from church books and gifts from
well-to-do friends.
   Lee, a Navajo and former president of the College of Ganado on
the Navajo Reservation, said the shift in church policy toward the
Indians had occurred after the 1985 death of President Spencer W.
Kimball.
   Lee said Benson, 90, was so enfeebled by age that his counselors
in the First Presidency _ Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson _
made all important decisions in his name.
   The last church general authority to be excommunicated was
Richard R. Lyman. He was excommunicated in 1943 for adultery but was
re-baptized 11 years later.

<HEAD>Troops Kill Three Palestinians, Suspected Collaborator Killed: Arab
Reports</HEAD>

   Israeli troops today fatally shot three
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including a teen-age girl,
and the body of a suspected Arab collaborator was found in the
occupied Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   The army imposed a curfew in Nablus, where the shootings
occurred, and declared the city a closed military zone.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed two of the deaths and said the army
was checking the report of the teen-age death.
   The deaths would bring to 557 the number of Palestinians killed
by troops or Israeli civilians since the Palestinian uprising began
in December 1987 and 104 killed by fellow Arabs, most for allegedly
collaborating with Israel. Thirty-nine Israelis also have been
killed.
   Arab reports from Nablus said two Palestinians who were wanted by
the army were killed in a predawn clash on the western outskirts of
the city.
   The army spokeswoman said they were killed while planning an
attack and that three others were arrested. She said she could not
release any more details.
   When news of the clash spread in Nablus, a primary point of
unrest during the 20-month uprising in the occupied territories,
student demonstrations broke out, Arab reports said.
   Hundreds of masked youths took to the streets, raising
Palestinian flags in the heart of the city. ``Nablus is boiling and
angry,'' an Arab reporter said.
   The reports said a third Palestinian, Muna Tamaam, 14, was shot
in the heart and killed instantly while participating in one of the
demonstrations. They said at least two people were wounded.
   In the Gaza Strip, a man identified as Abdul Rahman Abu Shaluf
was found dead in Rafah, Arab reports said. The man had been shot,
apparently by Palestinians who suspected he collaborated with Israel.
   At least two others were wounded in clashes with troops in Gaza
today, the reports said.

<HEAD>Sorenson Asks Return Of $15 Million In University of Utah Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A millionaire who donated $15 million in
stocks to the University of Utah withdrew the donation after the
school said it could not rename its medical college and hospital
after him.
   In a letter Friday to university President Chase Peterson, James
L. Sorenson said he was disappointed with the way the school handled
the controversy that arose after plans to rename the medical
facilities were announced.
   Sorenson said he felt it was ``unfortunate that the university
does not want to take any responsibility for its failure to honor
proposals it conceived when it undertook a prolonged campaign to
recruit the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the state.''
   Sorenson's gift of 250,000 shares of Abbott Laboratories stock,
negotiated with the university over several years, was announced in
May.
   Protests arose, and Peterson said in a letter earlier Friday that
it had become impossible to rename the school and hospital after
Sorenson. Instead, he proposed establishing the J.L. Sorenson
Medical Institute and endowed chairs in Sorenson's name.
   ``It seems to me that the university's desire in recent weeks has
been more to avoid controversy than to find appropriate uses for my
endowment,'' Sorenson wrote in response.
   He said he realized the endowment plan had created ``substantial
pressure'' on the university.
   ``I do not want the siege to continue on my account,'' he said,
adding that he felt the university had, in effect, ``adopted a
`leave it or take it,' attitude.''
   Sorenson, saying the gift was perhaps too large for the school to
handle in one endowment, asked for the return of the stock ``so that
I can reallocate it to other charitable institutions that are in
need.''
   Mike Mattsson, university vice president for development,
apologized for ``the harm caused through all of this to the Sorenson
family and to the university.''
   ``I assume the council will respond to his request and return the
money,'' Mattsson said. ``As I understand the process and release of
the letter, this closes any other options for being explored.''

<TEXT>
   A popular lakeside vacation area for
East Germans has turned into a transit point for thousands of
refugees hoping to make it to West Germany under a plan agreed on
this week between Bonn and Budapest.
   ``We'll believe it all only when we're over there,'' an East
Berliner said Friday, using the typical East German shorthand for
West Germany.
   On Thursday, government sources in Bonn, West Germany, said
Hungarian and West German officials had devised a plan to allow up
to 20,000 East Germans to flee to the West in the next few days.
   Officials said Friday that Hungary's Red Cross, already
accommodating an estimated 3,000 East Germans in Budapest, opened a
new ``tent city'' for 3,000 more at Zanka near Lake Balaton.
   Many of the estimated 200,000 East Germans vacationing in Hungary
are camping around the lake.
   The main Budapest camp, Csilleberc, was so crowded that new
arrivals were being bused to Zanka, said Arpad Alfoeldi, deputy head
of Hungary's Red Cross.
   However, he denied a report on the German-language radio station
Danubius that the move was tantamount to evacuation prior to
shipping the East Germans to the West.
   East Germans, some on their way home from Black Sea vacation
spots in Bulgaria and Romania, flocked to the three Red Cross camps
in Budapest after word was leaked of plans for the mass exodus.
   Karsten Voigt, foreign affairs expert for West Germany's
opposition Social Democrats, said Hungarian Communist Party
president Rezso Nyers assured him that all East Germans who want to
leave Hungary for West Germany will be able to do so.
   Hungary's prime minister, Miklos Nemeth, and West German
officials have estimated that up to 20,000 East Germans in Hungary
want to go to West Germany, where they receive automatic citizenship
and assistance in starting a new life.
   More than 5,000 East Germans already have used Hungary to escape
to Austria and then to West Germany since Budapest started
dismantling fortifications along its western border in May.
   Between 30 and 40 East Germans each day travel illegally from
Czechoslavakia _ the only country they can visit without permission
from their government _ to Hungary, the Hungarian daily Mai Nap said.
   Police in West Berlin said Friday that East German border guards
had fired shots in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent an East German
man from fleeing. They said the 24-year-old man, who was not
identified, managed to scale border fortifications and arrived
unharmed.
   Also Friday, security officials in Munich said they expected East
Germany to use any mass exodus of East German refugees to slip
intelligence agents into West Germany.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Insurers in Suit over Satellite Lost in Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance companies cannot recover $5 million
from makers of a Western Union satellite that was rendered useless
by a mechanical failure that left it short of its required orbit.
   In the first lawsuit involving property damage in outer space,
the 4th District Court of Appeal dismissed a lawsit filed by five of
the insurance firms that paid out $105 million after the satellite's
booster rocket failed moments after its deployment from the shuttle
Challenger in February 1984.
   Attorneys said this week's ruling likely will further the
commercial use of outer space by preventing astronomical insurance
costs for cargo.
   If the insurers had been allowed to seek reimbursement of claims
paid on their clients' losses in space, manufacturers said, they
feared a resulting flood of costly court cases that would greatly
reduce incentives for commercial space exploration.
   The Westar VI communications satellite launched by Challenger was
supposed to reach an orbit 22,000 miles above the earth. It was
designed to last 12 years and handle telephone transmissions and
television and computer data.
   But four seconds after the satellite's rocket ignited, its nozzle
disintegrated and its motor shut down. That stranded the satellite
at an altitude of 655 miles, where it was useless.
   When Western Union bought the rocket from McDonnell Douglas
Astronautics Co., a Huntington Beach subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas
Corp., the two companies signed a contract barring any lawsuits
between Western Union and McDonnell Douglas, its contractors or
subcontractors.
   McDonnell Douglas subcontracted work on the rocket's motor to
Morton Thiokol Co. of Chicago and work on its nozzle to Hitco of
Gardena, Calif.
   Western Union fully insured the satellite, and the insurance
companies paid Western Union the $105 million value of the satellite
after the launch failed.
   Appalachian Insurance Co. and four other insurers, who paid out
about $5 million of that sum, sued McDonnell Douglas, Morton Thiokol
and Hitco, charging negligence and asking for the return of the
plaintiffs' money.
   Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour ruled in January 1987 that
the sales contract between Western Union and McDonnell Douglas
prohibited the insurers from getting the money back.
   The three-judge appeals panel agreed unanimously.

   Police investigating the slaying of
entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife plan to interview
actor Sylvester Stallone, according to a report today.
   The Los Angelese Times report said Stallone was not a suspect in
the deaths.
   He is a director of a film company that owns almost half of the
stock in Live Entertainment Inc., the company that Menendez headed,
and was to be questioned about some of his business contacts, the
Times said, quoting law enforcement sources it did not name.
   Calls to the actor and his attorney were not immediately returned.
   Menendez, 45, and his wife Kitty, 44, were shot and killed Aug.
20 in their Beverly Hills mansion.
   Stallone starred in the ``Rambo'' movies, the main commercial
successes for Carolco Pictures Inc., which owns 49 percent of Live
Entertainment. Stallone is a member of Carolco's board of directors.
Menendez also was a director and executive vice president of Carolco.
   Live Entertainment was formed earlier this year from the merger
of International Video Entertainment, a video distributor, and
Lieberman Enterprises, a Minneapolis-based music and video company.
   Stallone had about a 10 percent interest in International Video
Entertainment until it merged with Lieberman in 1988.
   Menendez' relatives have speculated that his death was ordered by
the mafia.
   International Video Entertainment previously had been owned by
Noel C. Bloom, who was identified in a California attorney general's
report on organized crime as a major distributor of X-rated movies
and a former associate of a member of the Bonanno organized crime
family.
   Peter Hoffman, Carolco's president and chief executive, has said
International Video Entertainment itself was never involved in
pornography.

<HEAD>Fighting Flares Anew As Beirut Smolders From Savage Shelling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian troops battled with
howitzers and mortars in and around the capital today, but thousands
of residents who fled the barrages slipped back into the smoldering
city to check on homes and friends.
   Police said one person was killed and 18 wounded in the fighting,
raising the casualty toll from nearly six months of daily shelling
to at least 824 killed and 2,438 wounded.
   The fighting broke out again before dawn today after a four-hour
lull. Eighteen people were killed and more than 100 wounded in 24
hours of non-stop shelling that eased at midnight Friday, leaving
buildings on fire and streets choked with rubble.
   Today's shelling was heaviest in the hillside Druse Moslem
Shweifat suburb on Beirut's southeastern edge as Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun's gunners zeroed in on the area, where the Syrians
have deployed long-range artillery.
   On Friday, salvos of rockets were fired from Shweifat on the
besieged 310-square-mile Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   The estimated 1 million Christians in the enclave have been
besieged by the Syrian forces and their militia allies for nearly
six months.
   Despite radio warnings, thousands of Moslems who fled to southern
Lebanon for safety in recent weeks returned to Beirut to check on
their homes and businesses after Friday's savage bombardment.
   The barrages that began March 8 have forced all but an estimated
10 percent of Beirut's 1.5 million residents to flee the devastated
city and seek refuge in southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley in the
east and mountain resorts northeast of the capital.
   The coastal highway linking Beirut with the south was jammed
today with thousands of vehicles heading for Beirut. But others were
fleeing south as smoke billowed from the wooded hills around
Shweifat.
   Amin Jirdi, a Druse who lives in Shweifat, said the area was
``literally ploughed by shellfire'' from Aoun's U.S.-made 155mm
artillery during the night.
   He said the Christian gunners deployed in the Baabda hills
overlooking Shweifat, ``fired a shell at every street and every
corner. They can see the whole area and they raked it with fire.''
   Jirdi, who was fleeing south with his wife and two daughters,
said the shelling destroyed houses, shops and businesses.
   ``Several fires blazed out of control though the night. We
sheltered in a basement until early this morning when the shelling
decreased and we managed to get out,'' he said.
   Jirdi was interviewed at the key road junction at Khaldeh, three
miles south of Shweifat, as he drove the family sedan loaded with
mattresses, blankets and clothes out of the battle zone.
   His wife, Mounifa, her eyes brimming with tears, said: ``This is
all we were able to pack. It seems we'll be away from our home for a
long time.''
   Militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Syrian-backed
Progressive Socialist Party stopped civilians from driving into
Shweifat, saying Christian militiamen in the hills were ``shooting
at everything that moves.''
   But as the crackle of automatic fire was heard from the
brush-covered hills above Khaldeh, Beirutis flocked back into the
devastated capital, where gutted apartment blocks still smoked.
   ``I'll leave again as soon as I find out what happened to my
apartment,'' said Ibrahim Fatha, who lives in the Bourj Abu Haidar
district of Moslem west Beirut.
   Other people heading into the city also said they were only going
to inspect property and check on relatives before returning south,
where tens of thousands of Beirutis are camped out on the roadside
in cars and makeshift tents fashioned from plastic sheets tied to
trees.
   The current round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
broke out March 8 after Aoun, seeking to restore the government's
long-eroded authority, blockaded illegal ports south of Beirut run
by Syrian-backed militias.
   The Syrians and their Moslem and leftist allies retaliated by
besieging the Christian enclave.
   Beirut's influential an-Nahar daily said the fighting of the last
few days ``indicates that French and Soviet efforts to find a
settlement to the Lebanese crisis have reached a dead end.''
   Gennady Tarasov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Middle
East department, and Francois Scheer, secretary-general of the
French Foreign Ministry, have shuttled between Beirut, Damascus and
other Arab capitals over the last two weeks seeking to mediate an
end to the fighting.
   But, like an Arab League mediation committee before them, their
efforts have so far failed to secure a cease-fire.

   Assailants in a car shot and seriously
wounded two British soldiers at a military housing area, police said
today, and the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility.
   The shooting occurred late Friday in a northwestern village near
Muenster, 85 miles north of Bonn. It was the fourth attack on a
British military facility in West Germany since June.
   Muenster police spokesman Hans-Jochen Petzold said today that one
soldier was in critical condition and the other was seriously
wounded.
   One was being treated in a British military hospital and the
other at a nearby West German hospital, police said.
   ``One of the wounded men was able to tell us what happened,''
Petzold said.
   He said the soldiers were walking in civilian clothes in a
housing area for British troops in the village of Gremmendorf when a
car pulled up and its occupants asked in English how to reach
Muenster.
   When the soldiers responded in English, one of the car's
occupants opened fire with an automatic rifle, the spokesman said.
   The IRA claimed reponsibility in a statement made by telephone to
a news agency in Dublin, Ireland, along with an agreed codeword to
verify its authenticity.
   ``While the undemocratic partition of Ireland is maintained by
British military might, the IRA reserves the right to strike at the
British government and British army wherever they seek respite from
their war against the Irish people,'' the caller said.
   Pete Brown, a spokesman for the British Rhine Army, said the
soldiers were members of the 14th-20th King's Hussars.
   Brown said both soldiers are from the greater Manchester area and
that their relatives had been informed of the attack. He said he
could not release their identities.
   Britain's domestic news agency Press Association quoted Inspector
Walter Vafielak of the West German police as saying, ``There were
many shots to the arms and legs. The soldiers fell to the ground and
were leeding heavily.''
   Press Association quoted Vafielak as saying the three attackers
reportedly spoke with Irish accents.
   The IRA has repeatedly attacked British troops stationed in West
Germany in recent years in an extension of its guerrilla war in
Northern Ireland, a British province.
   The barracks at Muenster, about 112 miles north of Bonn, is the
headquarters of the British Army's 4th Armored Brigade in West
Germany. More than 4,000 British soldiers are stationed there.
   The British Defense Ministry said in a statement that the two
soldiers were off duty at the time of the attack.
   Two car bombs have exploded at British military housing areas
this summer and one soldier was killed in an attack in Hanover.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the fatal attack and is
suspected by police in the other. A third car bomb planted in a
soldier's car was found last week and defused without incident.

<HEAD>Seven Soldiers Killed By Sinhalese Militants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military said Sinhalese militants
killed seven soldiers in the south today, a day after officials and
witnesses reported 62 people died in violence inspired by the
radicals' anti-government campaign.
   Six Sinhalese soldiers were killed when militants detonated
explosives in Kamburupitiya village in Matara district, about 85
miles south of Colombo, said military officials who cannot be
identified under briefing rules. Four soldiers were injured in the
attack, they said.
   In a separate attack in Malabe, a Colombo suburb, one soldier
died and four others were injured when radicals opened fire on a
military patrol, the officials said.
   The militants belong to the People's Liberation Front, an
extremist Sinhalese group that launched a campaign of violence two
years ago after the government made peace overtures to the nation's
Tamil minority, who are fighting for a separate nation in the
northeast.
   Residents of Punewa village, 120 miles north of Colombo, said men
in army uniforms rounded up 31 young men late Thursday and fatally
shot them. They said the raiders were thought to be pro-government
militiamen retaliating for the killing of a policeman by Sinhalese
radicals.
   Villagers reached by telephone said the homes of the young men
and their bodies were burned.
   Military officials said 20 other burned bodies with bullet wounds
were found in the central Kandy district Friday, but gave no
details. Officials also reported 11 other deaths.
   The military officials said they had ``heard of the incident'' in
Punewa, but had no details. Other sources said at least 30 people
were slain in the village to avenge the killing of few hours earlier
of police inspector R.M. Ratnayake.
   Police said Ratnayake was shot and killed by Sinhalese radicals
of the People's Liberation Front.
   Opposition parties and human rights organizations say the
government has set up vigilante groups to counter the radicals.
Vigilantes and the military are accused of killing hundreds of
civilians suspected of sympathizing with the guerrillas.
   At least 1,222 people have been killed since June 20, when
President Ranasinghe Premadasa imposed a state of emergency and gave
security forces special powers.
   A senior government official said privately that members of the
armed forces, police and the governing United National Party asked
the government Friday to disarm the four known vigilante groups,
called the Yellow Cats, Eagles, Black Cats and People's
Revolutionary Red Army.
   He said some Cabinet ministers were among the petitioners.
   The People's Liberation Front, protesting the alleged killings by
the military, called a strike this week that virtually paralyzed the
Sinhalese heartland of southern and central Sri Lanka.
   Sinhalese radicals have called many strikes in their 2-year-old
war against the government that has taken more than 4,000 lives.
They oppose government concessions to the militants of the ethnic
Tamil minority and the presence of Indian peacekeeping troops in
that area.
   An estimated 10,000 people have been killed in the 6-year-old
Tamil war for independence. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up
18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination
by the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese.
   India became involved because it is the regional power and has a
Tamil population of 60 million, most of them in Tamil Nadu state
just across the Palk Strait from Sri Lanka.
   Its soldiers were deployed two years ago to supervise a peace
accord aimed at ending the separatist war by giving Tamils limited
autonomy.

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani has resigned
as commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, saying he is too busy
with other matters, Tehran Radio reported today.
   Rafsanjani resigned in a letter to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who
took over as the Islamic republic's spiritual leader after Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini died June 3, the state-run radio said in a report
monitored in Nicosia. Khamenei accepted Rafsanjani's resignation,
the radio said. It gave no other details.
   Khomeini appointed Rafsanjani as commander-in-chief in June 1988
after Iranian forces were defeated by the Iraqis in a series of
offensives in the Persian Gulf war. Rafsanjani's main task was to
reorganize Iran's military, badly demoralized by the battlefield
setbacks and nearly eight years of war.
   The disarray in the fractious military, the shortage of weapons
and growing war weariness among Iran's 50 million people after
horrendous casualties led him instead to persuade Khomeini to
unconditionally accept a 1987 U.N. Security Council cease-fire
resolution. That took effect Aug. 20, 1988.
   The resignation of Ransanjani, 55, as Iran's military chief
indicates he will focus his priorities on his declared policy of
revitalizing Iran's sagging economy and the huge task of post-war
reconstruction.
   Khamenei will presumably now take over as commander-in-chief.
Khamenei, 50, Rafsanjani's political ally, made it clear soon after
he was elected to succeed Khomeini that he intended to control
military affairs.
   Rafsanjani, with wide support in the 350,000-strong Revolutionary
Guards Corps, will retain considerable influence in military affairs.
   During his tenure as commander-in-chief _ he also served as
parliament speaker at the time _ he merged the command structure of
the regular army and the Revolutionary Guards to eliminate parallel
and often conflicting chains of command that seriously hampered
military operations during the gulf war.
   Akbar Torkan, the minister of defense and armed forces logistics
in Rafsanjani's new Cabinet, will wield more control of military
affairs than any of his predecessors following the merger approved
by Parliament in July.
   Torkan, a close Rafsanjani aide, was head of Iran's Defense
Industries Organization during much of the war and was a driving
force behind building it up to produce surface-to-surface missiles
and other weapons to counter a U.S.-led arms embargo. He will now
try to expand the defense industry.
   Rafsanjani's interior minister, Hojatoleslam Abdullah Nouri,
controls internal security forces. He was Khomeini's powerful
representative at Revolutionary Guards headquarters and wields
considerable influence in the corps and is well-placed to counter
any challenge to Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called
pragmatists, from radical rivals.
   Rafsanjani was elected July 28 with a landslide vote to succeed
Khamenei, president since 1981.
   He was given unprecedented executive powers through
constitutional reforms, aimed at eliminating competing power centers
that have paralyzed the decision-making process, overwhelmingly
approved in a national referendum.

<TEXT>
   Up to 30 rockets slammed into Kabul's
airport and main bazaar today, killing at least two people and
injuring more than six in some of the worst shelling in the capital
this year.
   All flights in and out of Kabul Airport were suspended after more
than 20 rockets hit the area, many falling near the main terminal
building.
   Some passengers fled the building while others sought shelter
under staircases. The incoming flight from New Delhi was diverted
back to India.
   Witnesses said a number of civilians were killed and injured when
the rockets hit houses near the airport, but that could not be
confirmed.
   ``It was really heavy rocketing, really dangerous,'' said George
von Reppert, a camerman for German television trying to depart for
New Delhi. ``It was really shaking the windows.''
   The rocketing started around 9:30 a.m. and continued for more
than three hours. Government forces fired back from the batteries of
rocket launchers stationed around the airport, a joint civilian and
military facility.
   At the main bazaar, a rocket hit a narrow alley of clothing
stores behind the Kartpariwan Mosque at midafternoon.
   Firefighters said at least two people were killed immediately and
six taken to hospitals. Merchants struggled to get heavy boxes full
of winter parkas away from the flames, while leaky hoses sprayed the
entire area with water.
   Kabul has been under rocket attack since late June almost daily,
but the attacks today followed a lull. The government accuses the
Moslem rebels of waging a terror campaign aginst Kabul by killing
civilians. The guerrillas say they only shoot at military targets
and the rest are fired by the government.
   More than 300 people have been killed and 900 injured in the
attacks since June.

   Baseball, academia and President Bush
memorialized A. Bartlett Giamatti as a man with high standards and a
common touch, as at home in the bleachers as in the company of
scholars.
   Giamatti died Friday at age 51 after apparently suffering a heart
attack at his vacation home on the resort island of Martha's
Vineyard.
   His death came five months after he became baseball commissioner
and eight days after he banned Pete Rose, baseball's all-time hit
leader, for betting on the game.
   ``While his commissionership is tragically a very, very, very
short one, it will be remembered as a meaningful one,'' Milwaukee
Brewers president Bud Selig said.
   Among those who had praise for Giamatti were Rose, Yale
professors, baseball owners and some of the players whom he had
ordered suspended during an earlier tenure as National League
president.
   Some suggested that the Rose affair had taken a toll on Giamatti,
a chain-smoker who called cigarettes his ``primary vice.''
   ``He wrestled with all of baseball's problems,'' said New York
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who talked to Giamatti by phone
45 minutes before he was stricken. ``It may have all come in on him.
   ``I'm not a man who cries, but I cried today.''
   President Bush, a fellow alumnus of Yale University, where
Giamatti was president from 1978 to 1985, said the two were close
friends and had talked at length about the Rose case, and ``all
through that I was thinking of the difficulty that he had in setting
these standards that high and staying with it.''
   In an Aug. 18 interview with The Associated Press, Giamatti
brushed aside the notion that he was overstressed by the Rose
matter. ``While it's a serious matter, it doesn't take most of the
time,'' he said.
   Giamatti was found unconscious in his bed and in full cardiac
arrest when officers responding to a call from one of his sons
arrived at 3 p.m. Giamatti was pronounced dead about an hour and a
half later, said Matthew Stackpole of Martha's Vineyard Hospital.
   Giamatti's body was taken to Falmouth, Mass., this morning where
an autopsy was to be performed.
   Rose was ``deeply saddened'' by the news of Giamatti's death,
Rose's attorney, Robert A. Pitcairn, said in a statement issued in
Cincinnati. ``In spite of their dispute, Pete had great personal
respect for the commissioner,'' he said.
   Rose can apply for reinstatement after a year, and it will be up
to Giamatti's successor to rule on it.
   Baseball's executive council, composed of the two league
presidents and seven club owners, will rule the game until a new
commissioner is chosen.
   Giamatti became baseball's seventh commissioner on April 1,
succeeding Peter Ueberroth after serving as National League
president since December 1986. He served 154 days of his five-year
term.
   ``Bart's legacy will be greater than the Pete Rose episode,''
said Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of the Chicago White Sox board.
``Bart brought the owners together. Bart liked everybody. His way of
liking everybody got us to like each other.''
   Montreal pitcher Kevin Gross was among several players suspended
by Giamatti when he was National League president.
   ``He did what he felt he had to do, but he did it as a perfect
gentleman. I saw him the next year at the All-Star Game. He told me
that he was glad to see me there, and he wished me the best and was
real nice to me and my family,'' Gross said.
   Giamatti was remembered as being as comfortable speaking to Yale
groundskeepers _ with whom he would attend Red Sox games _ as he was
to the scholars who shared his passion for 16th century Engish
poetry.
   ``Bart did not forget the secretary who had once typed his
letters,'' said Yale professor Thomas Greene.
   Said St. Louis Cardinals Manager Whitey Herzog: ``For being book
smart, I thought he had a lot of street smarts. Which is tough to
find sometimes.''
   Giamatti said of baseball: ``I always found it the most
satisfying and nourishing of games outside of literature.''
   Born in Boston on April 4, 1938, Giamatti was only 40 when he
became Yale's youngest president in 200 years. He had joined the
Yale faculty in 1966 after teaching Italian and comparative
literature at Princeton University.
   Giamatti is survived by his wife, Toni, and three children,
Marcus Bartlett, Paul Edward Valentine and Elena Walton Giamatti.

<HEAD>Moslem Extremists Convicted in Assassination Attempts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A court today convicted 26 Moslem extremists
on charges stemming from assassination attempts on two former
Cabinet ministers and a journalist and sentenced them to prison
terms ranging from one year to life.
   The 17-month trial was part of an extended government crackdown
on fundemantalists that began in 1981 when President Anwar Sadat was
assassinated and the attack was blamed on a fundamentalist group.
   The Cairo court sentenced five of the defendants, all Moslem
activists, to life imprisonment. The other 21 convicted defendants
received from one to 10 years in prison. Seven people were acquitted.
   Prosecutors had demanded the three-man state security court
sentence 15 of the defendants to death by hanging.
   Court President Omar el-Oteify read the judgment at a brief
morning court session without specifying the exact charges the
defendants were convicted of.
   In the indictment, prosecutors had also charged the defendants
with forming an illegal paramilitary organization called ``Salvation
from Hell'' to destabilize the government through assassination and
other means.
   As the court president finished reading the judgment, some
defendants shouted from the cages in which they were restrained:
``We will kill the judge!'' ``This is a plot against Islam!'' and
``Injustice!'' Some women in the audience, many veiled in strict
Islamic fashion from head to toe except for eye-slits, wailed and
screamed as the chief judge read out the judgment.
   ``My son, my son,'' screamed a woman as she threw herself on the
bars of a cage where defendants were confined.
   Discussing the verdict later with reporters, el-Oteify said seven
of the defendants ``agreed to form an illegal party and to declare
(Egypt's) rulers and society infidel. They called for `jihad' to set
up an Islamic state by force.''
   For many fundamentalist Moslem extremists, Moslems with different
interpretations of the faith are infidels who can be killed at will
once ``jihad,'' or holy war, has been declared.
   All the defendants had pleaded innocent to charges of active
participation or collusion in the murder attempts in 1987 on former
Interior Ministers Hassan Abu-Basha and el-Nabawy Ismail and Editor
Makram Mohammed Ahmed.
   The attempts against the ministers are believed to have been
meant as retaliation for crackdowns on Moslem militants during their
earlier tenures at the Interior Ministry, which handles domestic
security.
   Ahmed, who edits the state-owned weekly Al-Mussawar and is a
confidant of President Hosni Mubarak, was targeted after he wrote a
series of scathing articles condemning extremist terror.
   All three attempts involved shootings with automatic weapons from
cars. Abu-Basha was wounded seriously, Ahmed suffered a minor hand
injury, and Ismail was uninjured.
   Moukhtar Nouh, a defense lawyer, said he would present a petition
asking for a reduction in the sentences or a retrial. Under the law,
the judgment is subject to confirmation by Mubarak.
   Three of those who received life terms are in custody: Yousri
Abdel-Moneim, 30, and Amin Abdullah Gomaa, 32, both unemployed; and
Adel Moussa Attiya, 29, a nurse. The other two, Magdi el-Safty and
Abdullah Abul-Ela, are being sought.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded today near the plant of a
Bogota newspaper that has openly opposed drug traffickers, killing
one person and injuring at least 12, news reports said.
   The bomb exploded in a truck parked outside El Espectador, the
second-largest daily in Colombia. Its editor was assassinated by
drug traffickers three years ago.
   There were no claim of responsibility for today's bombing. But
drug lords recently launched a campaign of bombings and
assasinations in a bid to force Colombia to reverse a decision to
extradite suspects to the United States.
   The Bogota radio station RCN quoted the Red Cross as saying one
person died. RCN and the Caracol radio station said 12 to 38 people
were injured, including three in the newspaper plant and others who
were in buses passing by.
   The bombing occurred as Colombia awaited the arrival Sunday of
U.S. military aid. A well-placed source at the Defense Ministry said
a U.S. advance team of eight _ one officer and seven enlisted men _
already was in Colombia.
   The team is ``doing nothing more than setting up a mobile
communications unit to coordinate the arrival of the military
equipment,'' said the source, who is working with the U.S. advisers.
   He denied reports that U.S. military aid already had arrived in
Colombia.
   Today's explosion shortly before 7 a.m. was heard 18 miles away
in this capital city of 6 million. The bomb was in a truck that had
been left in a gasoline station next to the newspaper's two-story
brick building, radio reports quoted witnesses as saying.
   Seven cars parked inside El Espectador's property were heavily
damaged or destroyed, the radio reports said. Windows of the
building were shattered. The newspaper's plant is just south of
Bogota's downtown business district.
   On Dec. 17, 1985, El Espectador's editor, Guillermo Cano, was
assassinated by men firing submachine guns as he left in his car
from the newspaper.
   El Espectador is one of the most respected newspapers in Latin
America for its staunch opposition to government corruption and
human rights violations. The newspaper had been publishing stories
calling for stronger action against drug traffickers.
   On Friday, Colombia's defense minister said foreign troops were
not needed to fight the war against drug lords.
   ``We can face this challenge alone'' Gen. Oscar Botero said.
   He said 100 police officers were sent to Medellin, home of the
world's most powerful cocaine cartel, to strengthen the 4,000-member
police garrison there. Drug lords based there are believed
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that is smuggled into the
United States.
   Botero said the army already has sent a special elite unit and an
anti-guerrilla battalion to the city, where authorities said police
defused a 40-pound bomb left at a bank Friday by terror squads
working for drug lords.
   A high-ranking U.S. drug official who spoke on condition of
anonymity told American reporters in Bogota that Colombia's 12 top
drug lords may be hiding in Colombia and perhaps have bribed
security forces to protect them. All are wanted in the United States.
   The official said drug cartels may have people stationed in small
towns watching for military or police movement. Army colonels can
make up to $15,000 monthly working for drug dealers, he said.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind there will be a great deal of
bloodshed,'' he said of the future of the government crackdown.
   The Pentagon said Friday that as part of a $65 million package
approved by President Bush, it will give Colombia two C-130
transport planes, five UH-1H combat helicopters and eight A-37 jets.
The equipment could start arriving by Sunday, officials said.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said that up to 200 American
military personnel could accompany the U.S. supplies for assignments
ranging from ``unloading to training.''
   President Virgilio Barco has said he welcomes the U.S. military
equipment and Colombia's justice minister, Monica de Greiff, said in
Washington this week that the country could use an additional $19
million in equipment.
   The government began its crackdown on drug lords after they
killed the leading presidential candidate and the top police
official in Medellin Aug. 18.
   Gen. Botero said that under special emergency measures,
authorities already had searched 2,004 properties believed linked to
traffickers and seized 550 ranches, villas and estates; 1,356 cars;
1,061 weapons; 349 airplanes; 142 motorcycles; and 33 yachts.

<HEAD>Federal Officials Seize Lebanese-Owned Jet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials today seized a $13
million Lebanese-owned jet and are weighing criminal charges against
the crew and passengers because the plane landed without permission
earlier this week at Harrisburg International Airport.
   Henry Brattlie, deputy district director of the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service office in Philadelphia, said the plane
landed at the airport Aug. 27, after disregarding orders to travel
to Philadelphia for immigration inspection. The plane had come from
London.
   The Gulf Stream G-3 jet, which can hold up to 20 passengers,
returned to Harrisburg again last night from Burbank, Calif., at
which time it was seized and at least three occupants were taken
into custody.
   Brattlie said the occupants were aliens who failed to check in
with immigration officials. He said the Lebanese passengers and crew
showed ``blatant disregard of the country's laws. We had no
knowledge when they came in whether they were terrorists or fine,
upstanding citizens.''
   He said a subsequent investigation showed they were not
terrorists.
   Brattlie is meeting this morning with Rick Sponsellor, an
assistant U.S. attorney from Harrisburg, to determine how to
proceed. ``We expect to file a complaint in the near future,''
Brattlie said.
   Under federal law, anyone attempting to bring an alien into the
country without permission can be fined $1,000 and sentenced to one
year in jail. Any alien who enters the country without checking in
with immigration officials can be jailed for up to five years if
convicted.
   One passenger, Tamar Manoukian, 28, disembarked to visit a sick
relative in Harrisburg, according to Brattlie.
   The plane is owned by a Lebanese corporation, co-owned by its two
pilots, and leased to its passengers, Watche Manoukian, 44, his
wife, Tamar, and his brother Varoujean, 38, he said.
   The jet, carrying the pilots, a third crew member, and the three
male passengers, traveled on to Burbank on Aug. 27, where the pilots
wanted to look at another jet, Brattlie said. Only the Manoukians
returned on the same jet to the Harrisburg International Airport on
Friday shortly before midnight. He said the others apparently left
the country.
   Brattlie said INS agents interviewed the passengers, then seized
the jet at 1:30 a.m.
   The Manoukians are in custody and could be fined $1,000 each for
disregarding the warnings, according to Brattlie. It was not clear
if the fourth passenger, an unidentified man, faced fines as well.

   The Soviet Union today detonated a nuclear
explosion with a force of 20 kilotons at a test site in Soviet
Central Asia, the official Tass news agency said.
   Tass said the blast was set off at 8:17 a.m. at Semipalitinsk in
Kazakhstan, 1,700 miles southeast of Moscow, ``to perfect military
equipment.''
   It said there was ``an insignificant, brief rise in the radiation
background'' inside the test zone. Radiation levels outside the test
range were normal, Tass said.
   A kiloton has the explosive force of 1,000 pounds of TNT. The
atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945 had the explosive
force of 20 kilotons.
   A local group in Kazakhstan calling itself Nevada after the U.S.
state is trying to put a stop to the nuclear tests that have been
carried out at Semipalatinsk for the last 40 years.

<HEAD>Man Rewards Cleaning Woman Who Turned In $100,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman took it upon himself to
reward a cleaning woman who recently stumbled on $100,000 lying
around at a bank and turned the money in.
   Marvin Smith, who owns a building and contracting company, said
he was shocked and a little bit peeved when he read that Nancy
Carroll had received no reward. He gave her $100.
   ``I just admire someone with that much honesty,'' Smith told the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``It's easy for someone to be honest and
return $10 _ not $100,000.''
   Ms. Carroll, 49, discovered the cash as she was emptying trash
cans by a teller's booth last month. She called bank security and
told them of her find.
   ``A lot of people are going to think I'm a fool,'' she said.
``I'm happy with myself.''
   Officials said it was the fourth time in four months that she had
found money and returned it.
   But for the $100,000 find, the newspaper said, she received
nothing more than a thank-you letter from the bank's president. And
that letter was sent to the maintenance company for which she is
employed, not to her personally.
   ``I try to reward my employees for their honesty,'' Smith said.
``I was totally shocked that the bank had not rewarded her.''
   Ms. Carroll also was shocked _ when she learned of Smith's
gesture.
   ``I don't believe this. God almighty. Is it real?'' she said.

<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The collapse of peace talks just a month
before Vietnam says it will withdraw its troops from Cambodia may
have guaranteed a new period of bloodshed for that turbulent land.
   The 19-nation peace talks that ended in Paris on Wednesday
offered an opportunity to end nearly 11 years of war. But
negotiators could not overcome the deep-seated hostility between the
Vietnamese-installed government and the Khmer Rouge, the largest
member of the guerrilla coalition.
   The hosts of the Paris conference, France and Indonesia, are to
begin consultations within six months to arrange a second round of
talks. Other diplomatic initiatives will continue.
   Interviews with two dozen officials in Vietnam and Cambodia
produced both hopeful and gloomy predictions. But it is certain the
nature of the conflict will change after Sept. 26, when Vietnam says
it will withdraw the last of its 26,000 soldiers.
   That could mean increased attacks by the Khmer Rouge, which
killed hundreds of thousands of people before Vietnam invaded in
late 1978 and ended its rule. The pullout also is to happen at the
beginning of the dry season, when combat usually intensifies.
   ``Many of our Cambodian friends are worried,'' said a Western aid
official in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. ``The government is
painting an optimistic picture. The people are less optimistic about
the government's ability to hold off the Khmer Rouge.''
   The Khmer Rouge responded to Vietnam's pullout of 50,000 troops
in 1988 with new attacks to try to seize strategic areas, said Gen.
Tran Cong Man, editor of the official Vietnamese army newspaper,
Quan Doi Nhan Dan.
   He reported major fighting since December in the area of Pailin,
in western Battambang province bordering Thailand. He said the
guerrillas were trying to establish a ``liberated zone'' and set up
a competing government.
   ``Sometimes they temporarily occupy some points but later they
are thrown back'' at Pailin, Man said in an interview. He said it
was at Pailin at the beginning of this year that Vietnamese troops
last participated in significant infantry combat.
   Man said that after Vietnam's pullout, the Khmer Rouge also will
target two other provinces bordering Thailand, Koh Kong and Siem
Reap.
   ``The Khmer Rouge think that if they can occupy these three
provinces, they can reverse the situation,'' he said.
   Vietnamese and Cambodian officials insist the guerrillas pose no
real threat to the Phnom Penh government and eventually will disband
if China and Thailand reduce military aid, as they have indicated
they will. Man said the Thai army already has halted artillery and
reconnaissance aircraft support for the Khmer Rouge.
   In an interview, Phnom Penh's Vice Prime Minister Kong Sam-Ol
said his government could not resolve the impasse because ``we have
given all our concessions.'' But diplomats say Hanoi and Phnom Penh
still want a political settlement because only that can guarantee an
end to the international isolation that has stunted their economies.
   Most non-Communist nations will continue to recognize the
resistance coalition and shun Phnom Penh until the guerrillas share
power. China and the United States have made increasingly clear they
want an acceptable settlement _ not just a Vietnamese pullout _
before considering normalization of relations with Vietnam.
   A Western ambassador said Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach told him that based on his talks with Chinese officials in
Paris, it appeared Beijing may budge on the issue.
   ``Thach had the impression the Chinese would move to a position
of a kind of participation by the Khmer Rouge, but not as complete a
role as before,'' the ambassador said.
   An East European diplomat in Phnom Penh said it was possible that
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the three-member guerrilla
coalition, could drop the Khmer Rouge if China decides to rely on
him instead of the Khmer Rouge to represent its interests in Phnom
Penh.
   The Communist Khmer Rouge has the strongest fighting force in the
guerrilla resistance.
   Sihanouk, 67, knows he must move soon. Each day, the former ruler
of Cambodia grows older, people remember him less, and perhaps most
importantly, the Phnom Penh government boosts its international
standing.
   After this month's pullout, a key resistance argument will begin
slipping away: that Phnom Penh is a ``Vietnamese puppet'' propped up
by Vietnamese troops.
   For the first time, some diplomats say it is very possible that
Australia, Thailand and other nations will recognize Phnom Penh even
without a political settlement if it holds internal elections and
can hold off the Khmer Rouge.

   Police with AK-47s stand guard at the gates and
watchtowers. Electricity courses through a wire fence surrounded by
a 15-foot-high brick wall.
   Security is tight at Beijing Prison No. 1, but the real controls
are psychological: two hours of daily ideological study, mandatory
writing of confessions, and the knowledge that even if one fled,
hiding would be difficult in the tightly policed society outside.
   This gray compound on Beijing's Educate the New Street is where
the capital's most serious offenders are sent, and where some of the
more than 2,000 Beijing residents arrested in the June crackdown on
dissent can expect to go.
   ``We haven't received any of those criminals yet,'' Vice Warden
Song Wenpo said, walking past neat whitewashed cells. ``They are
still being investigated, but very likely some will come here.''
   They will join about 2,000 prisoners _ including murderers,
thieves and about 20 ``counter-revolutionaries'' _ who spend their
days making plastic sandals and nylon socks and learning to ``reform
through labor.''
   Clad in blue-and-white uniforms with the word ``prison'' stamped
over the right breast, the inmates work in small prison factories
much like factories outside _ poorly lit, noisy, with aging
machinery and numerous safety hazards.
   Vice Warden Song fell into a hole in the floor that had been
covered with a thin rubber mat. For long, embarrassed minutes he
struggled to free his foot, while an aide whispered that perhaps
he'd best take off his shoe.
   The workshop's women prisoners hid grins. Two clutched each
other, trying to suppress giggles. Finally free, Song called over a
trustee and ordered the hole fixed.
   Physical security inside the prison is light. The guards don't
carry guns, and there are no barriers among the welter of drab
workshops, cellblocks, hospital and office buildings. But with more
than one staffer for every four inmates, supervision is close.
   ``There are some (inmates) who resist reform, resist labor,''
Song said. ``They are punished according to the law.''
   They may get a demerit on their record, or ``criticism and
education'' by their 11 cellmates during daily political study, Song
said.
   Or they may be put in the ``Little Number,'' a cell too small to
lie down fully where the light is never turned off, according to
former prisoner Yang Jing, who said he spent 10 months in the cell.
Song denied such a cell exists.
   Yang spent eight years in Beijing Prison No. 1 for helping print
a reformist magazine during the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement, one
of the predecessors of this spring's massive student marches.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping crushed it as he did the
pro-democracy protests in early June.
   Yang's magazine co-editor, Xu Wenli, is still at Prison No. 1 in
his fourth year of solitary confinement. Song said solitude was
``beneficial to (Xu's) individual reform.''
   ``He recognizes some of his problems but I'm afraid there must
still be a process'' of reform, Song said.
   Police and courts have refused comment on the status of students,
intellectuals and workers arrested in this year's movement. Song
said he believes most still are in police detention cells being
investigated.
   Chinese sources say some, including a few prominent
intellectuals, are held in a prison that officially doesn't exist,
Qincheng Prison in Beijing's western suburbs. Others, such as ousted
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, are said to be under house arrest.
   There is no limit on detention pending trial, and many of the
protesters may never be tried, according to Pan Shizhao, director of
the Beijing Bar Association's research department.
   He said many likely will be given ``labor education,'' a sentence
that can be handed down by police without a court appearance.
   Pan said the law requires that police notify families within 24
hours of detention and sets a seven-day limit for holding suspects
without charging them. But the New York-based International League
for Human Rights reported to the United Nations that these rights
are often being waived for the recent pro-demoncracy protesters.
   Courts have been ordered to sentence protesters severely, and
even defense lawyers have been urged to ``play an active role in
cracking down'' on the protesters.
   Many protesters shown under arrest on national television were
bruised from beatings. But Song said this rarely happens in his
prison, and that culprits are punished. If prisoners think their
rights are being abused, he said, ``they can come directly to me.''
   Pan, asked if lawyers could intervene to protect prisoner rights,
looked baffled. ``In prison (the convict's) duty is to obey prison
rules,'' he said. ``He is there to reform his thinking.''
   Most do, Song said. Only 5 percent of those released commit
crimes again.
   Those jailed for political activities also usually try to stay
out of trouble. Some released Democracy Wall activists now sell
clothing on the private market. Yang, released in April, said he
planned to paint.
   Democracy Wall activist Ren Wanding, released in 1983, was a rare
exception. He broke a long silence in November to distribute essays
denouncing human rights violations and commemorating Democracy Wall.
   Ren was arrested again in June.

<HEAD>Federal Agency Knuckles Under to Industry, Critic Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal agency responsible for correcting
dangerous automobile defects has halted 25 investigations covering
37 million vehicles in the past eight years under industry pressure,
a private watchdog organization charged Saturday.
   Four of the probes were abandoned this year by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to the Center for
Auto Safety. The center, founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader,
frequently accuses the government of lax automobile regulation.
   ``They are carrying out a predetermined policy to get the
government off the backs of the car companies,'' said Clarence
Ditlow, the group's executive director. ``Our feeling is the public
is literally riding at risk of death or injury in these 37 million
vehicles.''
   Tim Hurd, spokesman for NHTSA, said Ditlow had issued almost the
same statement three years ago. ``It's not the first time they've
been critical of us and I'm sure it's not the last,'' Hurd said.
   The agency denies the allegations, he said. ``Each of the
investigations referred to was closed for good reason after an
extensive investigation by NHTSA engineers.''
   In each of the 25 aborted investigations, NHTSA had requested
auto manufacturers to conduct safety recalls but was refused,
according to a Center for Auto Safety statement. Each time, the
agency discontinued its probe after being rebuffed, the statement
alleged.
   The vehicles under investigation collectively had experienced
2,176 accidents resulting in 653 injuries, 29 deaths and 106 fires,
it said.
   Ditlow acknowledged NHTSA sometimes stops investigations after
finding insufficient evidence to proceed, but said the cases his
group was targeting should have been pursued further.
   ``We're talking about when an agency writes a letter asking for a
recall and they (the manufacturer) say no and the agency closes the
case out,'' Ditlow said.
   Hurd said NHTSA never stops an investigation because an automaker
refuses to issue a recall. In each case Ditlow mentioned, the agency
decided a recall was not justified, Hurd said.
   This year, the agency has ordered 123 recalls involving 3.6
million vehicles, he said. ``The trend (toward ordering recalls) has
been upward since 1983,'' Hurd said.
   Among the vehicles NHTSA stopped investigating were 456,000 Ford
vans and trucks with dual rear wheels manufactured between 1977 and
1984, despite complaints that the wheels came off, the center said.
   Also, the agency abandoned investigations of 50,000 Thomas Built
buses from 1978 to 1986 that allegedly were susceptible to splitting
apart in crashes and 2 million 1978-82 Chrysler Omni-Horizon K-cars
subject to stalling because of defective carburetor isolator plates,
the center said.
   In each case, deaths and injuries were blamed on the alleged
defects, the group said.
   This year, the center charged, NHTSA prematurely stopped
investigating:
   _ Rear brake lockup in 1.9 million 1981-85 General Motors X-Cars,
for which 518 acidents, 168 injuries and nine deaths were blamed.
   _ Rear brake lockup in 450,000 Ford Mustang-Capris made in 1979,
blamed for 100 accidents, 40 injuries and seven deaths.
   _ Rear brake lockup in 2.7 million 1982-85 General Motors A-Cars,
blamed for 388 accidents, 125 injuries and seven deaths.
   _ Seats falling backward in 5.6 million 1981-86 Ford
Escort-Lynxes, blamed for 43 accidents and 35 injuries. Ford
recalled 80,000 of the affected models in 1984, the center said.

   The government on Saturday accused a U.N. panel of
``brazenly'' interfering in Chinese affairs by criticizing the June
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.
   The official Xinhua News Agency also quoted a government
spokesman as saying the crushed movement would never be regarded as
anything but a counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   The U.N. Subcommittee on Prevention of Discrimination and the
Protection of Minorities adopted a resolution Thursday appealing to
China to grant clemency to arrested protesters.
   ``The resolution brazenly interfered in China's internal
affairs,'' China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement read on the
official radio and television.
   China claimed the U.N. resolution was ``engineered and instigated
by a few Western members.''
   It was sponsored by panel members from the United States,
Britain, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, Mexico and the
Philippines.
   The resolution urged the U.N. Human Rights Commission to
investigate the Chinese crackdown. It was the first time that human
rights questions in one of the five U.N. Security Council
member-countries was referred to the commission, the U.N.'s highest
human rights body.
   Xinhua said China ``has all along attached importance to human
rights.''
   However, it said the government was ``driven beyond the limits of
forbearance'' by student protestors who repeatedly occupied
Beijing's Tiananmen Square during seven weeks of protests that began
April 15.
   Troops were called in to put down the protests killing hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of civilians on June 3-4. Since then, thousands
of people have been arrested, and at least 12 people have been
executed for taking part in the protests.
   Xinhua also quoted government spokesman Yuan Mu as saying any
attempts to ``reverse the verdict'' on the movement ``will never
succeed.''
   ``It is absolutely impossible for the case to be redressed,'' he
said, reiterating the official line that the protests sought to
overthrow the government and the ruling Communist Party.
   In an interview in Saturday's China Daily, Education Vice
Minister He Dongchang said China's open-door policy, which includes
sending thousands of students overseas, helped bring about the
democracy movement.
   ``Openness should alternate with closure,'' he said. ``Windows
cannot be opened with no screen to keep flies and worms from coming
in freely.''
   During the past 10 years, 80,000 Chinese students have left to
study abroad, but only one quarter have returned.
   China has announced plans to reduce the amount of time some
students are allowed to stay aboard.

<HEAD>District of Columbia Officials Say Bennett Lags on Promises to City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett has yet yet to follow
through on pledges to give special attention to the District of
Columbia's escalating drug problem, district offficials complain as
his national drug control policy is about to be released.
   When Bennett became the Bush administration's drug czar in
January, he praised the city's police department but bluntly said
that Mayor Marion Barry's government wasn't solving the city's drug
problem.
   That criticism was tempered, however, by his promise to make the
district a national ``test case'' for a federal urban drug control
strategy, a plan he had hoped to release within 90 days.
   But nine months and more than 250 killings later, city officials
say they're still alone in fighting the city's drug war.
   ``He hasn't delivered on his promises,'' Barry said at a recent
news conference. ``We haven't seen anything.''
   As the city's murder rate continues to soar, the district's
National Guard division is lending the police department
sophisticated surveillance equipment for use in tracking drug
dealers, but the extra Drug Enforcement Administration agents Barry
requested haven't materialized.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens has hired more than a dozen extra
prosecutors who are specifically charged with handling drug-related
murder cases, but money for extra police and police overtime that
Barry requested from Bennett and Congress hasn't been delivered.
   Portions of Bennett's national plan have been leaked in recent
weeks, but there has been no word on whether the comprehensive
strategy will include any specific help for the nation's capital.
Bennett aides did not return four telephone calls about the plan.
   Over the past several months, Bennett has made no secret of his
disdain for Barry and his government, saying at one point that the
Democratic mayor and other city officials ``aren't doing all they
can'' to battle the city's drug problem. He also said recurring
allegations that Barry himself used drugs haven't helped the
situation.
   But if Barry and Bennett can't seem to work together, the Bush
and Barry administration drug czars might get along better.
   Sterling Tucker, picked by Barry six weeks ago to coordinate the
city's drug battle, favors a low-cost program aimed at getting the
community involved in the drug fight.
   ``He has been very busy meeting with community leaders and
business, trying to enlist their support,'' said Tucker spokeswoman
Cynthia Harris said. ``He hasn't focused heavily on federal
initiatives.''
   But Tucker's plan to formally announce his program was scuttled
amid new allegations this past week that Barry and a convicted drug
dealer used drugs together when Barry visited the man's hotel room
last December. Barry vehemently denies ever having used drugs.
   The National Conference of Mayors has asked Bennett for a
16-point package that stresses interdiction at America's borders and
the destruction of drug crops in Central and South America. The
plan, which has Barry's backing, also calls for more federal funding
for local and federal anti-drug programs and tougher prosecution of
drug dealers.

   White House staffers are making an
all-out effort to get the words, setting and atmosphere of President
Bush's drug strategy speech just right in hopes he will go over well
in his first televised address to the nation.
   The Tuesday night address will mark the first time in his more
than seven months as president that Bush will take to the airwaves
for a formal speech to America _ a practice used often and
successfully by his predecessor, one-time actor Ronald Reagan.
   Cognizant that speaking to people in their living rooms requires
specialized communication skills, the White House is working
overtime to make sure it goes right.
   Bush aides have agonized over every phrase of the speech, working
with expert consultants, top-level advisers and the president
himself, who went over the latest draft and made suggestions when he
was in Washington Friday to meet with the new Japanese prime
minister.
   ``He is very interested in making sure that the substance of the
strategy comes through and it's not overweighted rhetorically,''
said White House Communications Director David Demarest, who is in
charge of the overall planning for the speech.
   It is being written by Mark Davis, who wrote the acclaimed speech
Bush delivered in Mainz, Germany last spring in which he challenged
the Soviet Union to tear down the Iron Curtain.
   Demarest and Davis have consulted with Cabinet members, drug
policy coordinator William Bennett and other advisers in working
toward a final version for a dress rehearsal Monday afternoon when
the president returns to the White House from his vacation.
   One detail getting a lot of consideration _ and still unresolved
_ was where the president will sit to make the speech.
   The obvious choice is the Oval Office, but aides said there was
some sentiment for using a less formal setting _ a study or office
in the residence part of the White House.
   Other items occupying the planners' attention: What should be in
the background? What should be on his desk top if he sits at a desk?
What color suit and shirt will he wear?
   Bush's campaign media coach, Roger Ailes, was asked for tips on a
draft of the speech and officials hoped he would be on hand to give
Bush some coaching on presentation.
   Ailes coached Bush through his campaign debates with Democrat
Michael Dukakis and developed his campaign TV message.
   Aides want to make sure Bush gets comfortable with the TV
TelePrompTer, which has a different feel from those used in a
ballroom, for instance, and that he practices the more intimate
speech cadences that will serve him better than a stump speaking
style.
   The speech itself will contain no dramatic proposals that have
not already been mostly aired in news accounts, said one official.
   The president will announce a $7.8 billion program that will
focus on stepped up enforcement and treatment on the domestic level
and will contain a newly increased emphasis on helping the Andean
countries fight the drug lords who produce and market narcotics.
   Bush wants the speech to lay out enough specifics of the plan so
viewers get a sense the government is intent on more than just
rhetoric, officials said.
   ``This has got to be a speech that reaches out to people on a
personal level, but at the same time you'll find that it does lay
out the specifics of the plan,'' said one source who has seen the
drafts.
   The speech emphasizes the comprehensive, broad-based nature of
the drug problem, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Demarest said the White House is trying to strike a balance
between substance and arresting language.
   ``People want to know there is a strategy, to know that it is
comprehensive and that it is credible and to the point,'' he said.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Leaders Falisied Ho Chi Minh's Death Date, Changed Will</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese leaders said they falsified
the date of Ho Chi Minh's death and changed portions of his will,
putting the leader's body on display in a glass mausoleum when his
initial wish was to be cremated.
   Communist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh issued a communique
admitting to ``a number of problems regarding President Ho Chi
Minh's testament and the day on which he died,'' the official Radio
Hanoi said Thursday. A transcript of the broadcast was seen in
Bangkok Friday.
   Ho's last testament recently was published in full for the first
time. It was made public after his death in 1969, but ``owing to the
historical circumstances at the time some facts were not
publicized,'' Linh's communique said.
   One of these was the section that requested he be cremated and
his ashes contained in three earthen pots for the north, the central
and southern parts of the country, it said.
   Instead, authorities asked Ho permission to change that section
of the will, and when he died the body was embalmed and placed in a
glass coffin publicly displayed in a Soviet-style mausoleum in
Hanoi, the communique said.
   The communique said the party leadership ``found it necessary to
preserve the uncle's remains for a long time so that compatriots
nationwide, particularly the southern compatriots and international
friends, might have a chance to visit the uncle.''
   This reflected the party's ``profound sentiments towards the
uncle,'' it said.
   ``It was because of this that we asked the uncle for permission
to revise this point in a way at variance with what he had
instructed,'' it said.
   The communique did not say when Ho was asked permission to change
the portion of the will regarding his cremation, or whether other
changes also were made with his permission.
   The communique said the party also decided to announce that Ho
had died a day later than he did.
   Ho died on Sept. 2. But this was Vietnam's National Day and the
party leadership changed the date ``to prevent the date of Uncle
Ho's death from coinciding with a day of great national rejoicing,''
the communique said.
   It said that in the original version of the will, authorities
also changed a sentence on the war against the United States.
   Ho actually wrote that ``the anti-U.S. war for national salvation
may last for a few years.'' But the officially announced version
read ``the anti-U.S. resistance is likely to drag on'', the
communique said.
   The communique said some paragraphs on national reconstruction
once the communist victory was won also were omitted.
   It said this was because ``when Uncle Ho passed away the
anti-U.S. war of resistance for national salvation was still
difficult and fierce and we had not yet won a final victory.
Therefore it was inappropriate to make public the paragraphs.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze are expected to sign
an agreement at their meeting Sept. 22-23 expanding superpower
cooperation on human rights, administration sources say.
   The memorandum of understanding, now being drafted by federal
agencies, will also outline U.S.-Soviet cooperation on new topics,
such as rule of law, occupational safety and women's issues, said
Bush administration officials who spoke on condition that they not
be further identified.
   The agreement, the result of a Soviet request, is viewed by the
administration as a step toward President Bush's stated goal of
integrating the Soviet Union more deeply into the world community,
the officials said.
   The agenda for the Baker-Shevardnaze meeting, to be held in Grand
Teton National Park in Wyoming, also includes more customary
U.S.-Soviet issues, such as arms control, and regional conflicts in
Africa, Afghanistan, Cambodia and Central America, said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   The discussion is also expected to touch on new areas of
U.S.-Soviet cooperation, such as the fight against terrorism and
drug trafficking, as well as the functioning of the United Nations
and other international organizations, the sources said.
   The meeting is designed to lay the groundwork for a summit
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. No
date has been set for a summit, and it was not clear whether one
would be held by year's end.
   A Soviet delegation is due in Washington during the week of Sept.
11 to work on the human rights agreement, which would involve
cooperation by U.S. agencies not usually involved in superpower
relations, such as the Justice Department, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration and the National Institute of Mental
Health.
   The wider dialogue stems from a request Shevardnadze made of
Baker in Paris on July 28 to expand U.S.-Soviet discussion on human
rights. Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamshin conducted
preliminary discussions on the expanded dialogue during a visit to
Washington early last month, said the officials.
   ``There is no memorandum yet because individual offices are still
working on their sections,'' said one State Department source.
   The expanded cooperation requested by the Shevardnadze would
include visits to the United States by Soviet miners to learn about
American safety techniques, said a second State Department official,
also speaking on condition of anonymity. Safety was an issue in
strikes by 500,000 Soviet miners in July.
   The Soviets also want to expand cooperation on environmental
issues, widening dialogue that began during the detente era, the
sources said.
   U.S. officials continue to criticize some Soviet human rights
policies, although the tone has changed with Gorbachev's reforms,
which among other things have increased levels of Jewish emigration,
long a point of contention.
   Bush has said that if the Kremlin changes its emigration policies
he may waive portions of a 1974 law that bars trade concessions to
the Soviet Union as long as Jews are restricted from leaving that
country. The law was named after the late Sen. Henry Jackson,
D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles Vanik, D-Ohio.
   Last Friday, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, which
monitors emigration from the Soviet Union, reported that more Jews
left that country in August than in any month since 1968: 6,756 Jews
last month, surpassing the previous high of 4,746 in October 1979.
   Since January, 33,444 Jews have been allowed to leave the Soviet
Union, and the total for 1989 could surpass the previous high of
51,320 set in the 1979, according to officials of the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry.
   Last year, 18,965 Jews emigrated from the Soviet, up sharply from
the 1987 figure of 8,155 and the 1986 figure of 914, the conference
reported.

<HEAD>State Trying To Protect Injured Baby Right Whale</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state has sent environmental
officers to the tip of Cape Cod this weekend in an effort to protect
a 5-month-old right whale that apparently was hit by boats at least
twice while feeding with its mother.
   ``This little devil and his mother seem to be bent on hanging
around the Race Point area where there is great congestion,'' said
Phil Coates, director of the Division of Marine Fisheries.
   ``Not only are these people getting too close, but they're
apparently banging into the darned thing,'' he added.
   The Labor Day weekend is one of the busiest of the summer on Cape
Cod, and good weather means that boaters are out in force. Officials
believe the whale will be all right if it gets through Monday.
   Right whales are an endangered species with about 300 in the
North Atlantic waters, including about eight calves like this one
born this year. Right whales have enormous heads and swim slowly.
   The injured whale has been swimming about 400 yards off the
Provincetown beach in recent weeks, possibly because its mother
feels protected there, according to Charles Mayo of the Research
Center for Coastal Studies.
   Mayo said the baby whale was hit by a boat two weeks ago, and has
shown fresh wounds recently. He said the small craft of fishermen
also disturb the whale.
   ``We definitely will be out there tomorrow, Sunday and Monday,''
said John Tulik, a sergeant on the state enviromental patrol.
``We're just telling people about it.
   ``They're not trying to damage the whale intentionally, but the
whales are right in where the boats parallel the shore to go
bluefishing.''

<HEAD>Thousands of East Germans Await Start of Mass Exodus to The West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of East Germans poured into
refugee camps on Saturday, joining thousands of others waiting for
an unprecedented mass exodus of East bloc citizens to the West.
   East Germans continued to fill up emergency camps here, and West
German and Red Cross officials said 500 were expected by the end of
the day.
   More than 3,000 East Germans already were inside the camps in and
near Budapest, awaiting passage to West Germany under an arrangement
between Bonn and Communist Hungary.
   Authorities will not say when the transfer is to take place,
although it is believed it will begin within days. It is the first
time a Warsaw Pact nation and a NATO country have worked together to
move huge masses of people from another Warsaw Pact nation.
   Hungarian Red Cross official Andras Kovacs, in charge of the
Csilleberc refugee camp in Budapest, said Saturday that six buses
carrying about 250 people had departed for Zanka, a new camp opened
90 miles to the southwest to house the overflow from the Budapest
camp.
   For weeks, thousands of East Germans have crowded emergency
quarters in Hungary, refusing to leave unless guaranteed safe
passage to the West.
   An estimated 6,000 already have fled to West Germany through
Austria, with the exodus starting shortly after Hungary began
removing barbed wire and other barriers from its westernmost border
in May.
   West Germany grants East German refugees automatic citizenship
and assistance in starting a new life.
   Hungary has been a traditional vacation spot for East Germans who
have difficulty getting permission for legal travel to the West from
their hardline Communist government, but can come to this liberal
Soviet bloc country relatively easily.
   An estimated 200,000 East Germans are now in Hungary. Hungarian
Premier Miklos Nemeth has estimated that up to 20,000 want to go to
West Germany.
   The Red Cross in Budapest has declined comment on reports that
mass transport of the refugees will begin from Zanka, which has its
own railway station.
   In Bavaria, West Germany's main border state with Austria,
hundreds of Red Cross personnel began work Saturday on a fifth
``tent city'' for the expected influx of East Germans.
   A West German spokesman said work was on schedule, with all five
tent communities expected to be standing by late Sunday with a
capacity of 5,000. Austrian railway officials, meanwhile, kept up to
50 train cars ready for quick movement to border points with Hungary
when the transport starts.
   Austrian border officials said about 50 more East Germans fled
illegally from Hungary overnight.
   Under a bilateral agreement, Hungary is obliged to send East
Germans trying to flee to the West back to their Communist homeland.
The standoff has led to tension between the two Soviet bloc nations.
   The plight of the East Germans waiting to go West has confronted
Hungary with a difficult choice between loyalty to its Warsaw Pact
allies and a new commitment to Western views on human rights.
   Hungary's dilemma has prompted leftists in West Germany and
Austria to demand new aid for Budapest and new rights for Hungarians
to work in Western Europe, to ensure that Budapest's reforms do not
falter.
   Karsten Voigt, a member of the West German opposition, denied
Bonn would ``reward'' Hungary, which is struggling with a $17
billion foreign debt, for allowing the East Germans out.
   Officials have said they do not know when the transport will
begin. But Zanka camp leader Gyoergy Fekete was overheard by Western
reporters to tell East Germans in tents and trailers outside Zanka
to report regularly until Tuesday, so as not to miss news of a
possible departure.
   As at the other camps, Zanka officials refused to allow reporters
entry. Several buses arrived each hour to the main entry point,
where the passengers _ most of them young and appearing tired _
disappeared behind the iron gate.
   Other would-be refugees came in their own cars, apparently after
cutting short holidays.
   One of the East Germans said he turned 21 while arriving Friday
from Czechoslovakia, which separates Hungary from East Germany.
   ``I drank a bottle of champagne all by myself in the train to
celebrate,'' he said.
   An East German at a Budapest camp on the grounds of a Roman
Catholic church said some fellow camp members were getting
increasingly nervous as they awaited news of their departure,
   ``I spend a lot of my time trying to calm some of the more
desperate ones,'' said the man. The East German, who gave his
hometown as Dresden, said many of those on the church grounds had
been there for three weeks or more.
   He spoke against a backdrop of tents and trailers on the other
side of the fence. Several trees were festooned with laundry lines,
and children played noisily on a set of swings.

   Japan may develop its own computer software for the
FSX fighter jet if the United States refuses to supply it, a Defense
Agency official said Saturday.
   However, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied
a report in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper that the United States
already has refused to provide the software.
   ``The United States has not yet said it won't provide the
software, and we interpret that to mean we can receive it,'' he
said. ``If it doesn't, then we must consider developing it
ourselves.''
   The paper referred to the software as ``the brain of the
fighter.''
   Japan and the United States signed an agreement in November for
joint development of the FSX, the next generation of fighter jet.
   The Japanese originally planned to develop the plane on their
own. The deal for joint development has met staunch opposition in
Congress, where some lawmakers call it a giveaway of American
technology.

   Congress, facing a crowded foreign policy
agenda marked by both crisis and opportunity, apparently is eager to
help Poland with significantly more aid than proposed by President
Bush.
   But although Democratic and Republican leaders agree on the need
to help Poland's new government demonstrate it can outperform the
communist regime it replaced, there is little sense of how much
additional money can be squeezed out of an already overburdened
budget.
   Overall, there is growing unease on Capitol Hill that the means
available do not match the magnitude of the global problems waiting
to be addressed.
   These include: How to deal with the challenge to the authority of
the government of Colombia by narcotics racketeers, how best to wage
the war on drugs, how to manage an era of warmer relations with the
Soviet Union, and how to deal with China in the aura of anger caused
by the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   House and Senate members are ending their summer recess and
streaming back to Capitol Hill, many fresh from visits to nations
whose problems Congress will soon seek to address.
   One of the trips claimed the life of Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas,
whose airplane crashed into a mountainside en route to a refugee
camp in Ethiopia. Many of Leland's colleagues vow to carry on his
efforts to combat world hunger.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas returned from a visit
with Poland's new leaders campaigning for increased aid and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, an apparent ally, says,
``Those members with whom I have talked believe we should go beyond
the $100 million the president proposed.
   ``I think the events occurring in Poland could be historic in
nature and we ought to be doing everything we can to encourage the
conversion of that government from communist to non communist,''
Mitchell said.
   ``The primary thing is food,'' Dole said. ``They want to fill the
shelves. They want to show change. People expect things to get
better. We need to act quickly.''
   Poland is plagued with serious consumer shortages and there are
long lines for the few goods available for sale.
   But Dole said there are only ``vague'' ideas of how to find the
money to pay for new assistance. And Mitchell said the final
dimensions of an aid package will not emerge for some time.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, says private capital, not government
aid, is likely to prove the answer as Poland struggles to build a
non-communist future.
   Lugar visited nine Latin American nations in 14 days of the
summer recess, focusing on the problems of narcotics, and huge
foreign debts.
   Congress is likely to be highly supportive of U.S. efforts to
help Colombia battle armed narcotics traffickers who recently took
responsibility for murdering a leading presidential candidate.
   ``It has focused the world's attention on how fragile a
government can be,'' Lugar said.
   Support also is strong for efforts to eradicate coca crops _ from
which the cocaine is produced _ in such countries as Colombia,
Bolivia and Peru.
   But Lugar said the lure of enormous profits is so great that he
does not believe eradication and crop substitution will lead to
anything but the removal of coca production to other fields in other
countries.
   ``It boggles the imagination as to how you control this,'' Lugar
said.
   The war against drugs will be won only through a determined
campaign to reduce consumption, Lugar said.
   One of his colleagues, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., is taking the
other tack, pressing for adoption of a ``debt for drugs'' exchange
in which Latin American nations guarantee the destruction of
narcotics crops in return for relief from some of the burden of
their large external debt.
   Calls on the United States to intervene to destroy narcotics
crops with U.S. personnel are expected, but Lugar and others advised
extreme caution.
   Attempts to use U.S. forces to destroy coca crops in Peru, Lugar
said, might well inject those forces into an internal civil war with
Peru's Shining Path guerillas who are centered in narcotics
producing regions.
   Congress is also closely following strategic arms control talks
with the Soviet Union in Geneva and negotiations on reducing
conventional arms in Europe in Vienna.
   Most congressional observers feel that agreement on sharply
reducing nuclear weapons will not come quickly, but that
conventional reductions are on a faster track.
   There is movement, meanwhile, to suspend the trade restrictions
imposed by the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment as the Soviet Union
eases emigration controls on Jews and other minority groups. ``It
hasn't jelled yet,'' Lugar says.
   The House is to vote this week on legislation granting Hungary
most-favored nation trade status in recognition of steps taken to
liberalize the Hungarian economy.
   Trade issues _ especially with Japan _ remain on the
congressional front burner as do efforts to free U.S. hostages in
Lebanon.
   On the horizon are the opening of negotiations on military base
rights with the Philippines. Lugar noted that the government of
Singapore has asked that its territory be considered for U.S. bases
if the U.S-Philippine talks collapse.
   He also predicted a ``lively discussion'' on the role of the U.S.
military presence in Asia, especially in South Korea where U.S.
forces have been stationed since the end of the Korean war in the
1950s.
   In the Senate, a number of Bush's appointments to key embassies
remain under fire by Democrats who complain the nominees have no
visible qualifications other than large contributions to Republican
campaigns.
   The nomination of Donald Gregg, who served as Bush's vice
presidential foreign policy adviser, remains in doubt because of
allegations he misled the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about
his alleged links to the Iran-Contra affair.
   The rest of the menu includes continued U.S. aid to
anti-communist rebels in Afghanistan, the resolution of conflict
involving Angola and Namibia, continuing protests against apartheid
rule in South Africa, and the prospects for free elections in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza.

<HEAD>Turkey to Reopen Rail Link to Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Saturday it will reopen
Turkey's only rail link to Europe, nine days after it was closed to
slow a tide of ethnic Turks seeking refuge in their native land.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Murat Sungar said the decision would
go into effect Sunday.
   The single train that travels daily between Munich and Istanbul
goes through Austria, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. It is Turkey's only
outlet to those countries by rail.
   Bulgaria had been sending hundreds of ethnic Turks daily on the
train since May. Turkey barred the entry of the train on Aug. 25.
   Turkey also began requiring visas for ethnic Turks coming from
Bulgaria on Aug. 22. About 310,000 have flooded into Turkey in the
past three months.
   Sungar said the decision to reopen the rail link was taken on the
assumption that Bulgaria would only send those ethnic Turks with
proper visas aboard the train.
   The immigrants say they are fleeing from a harsh assimilation
campaign in Bulgaria, which, among other things, has included forced
change of their Moslem names to Slavic ones.
   A group of 350 ethnic Turks arrived in this country with visas
during the past 10 days.

<TEXT>
   Christian leader Michel Aoun said Saturday
that the United States has done nothing to end the fighting in
Lebanon and secretly supports his Syrian foes.
   As the U.S.-trained general spoke in a bunker beneath the
shattered presidential palace, Syrian and Christian shells crashed
into houses, shops and businesses in the Beirut area, killing two
people and wounding 18.
   ``America's declared policy is in support of Lebanon's
sovereignty and independence, but in practice America supports
Syria's (military) presence in Lebanon,'' Aoun said at a news
conference in his bunker east of Beirut.
   ``This is a plot... American politicians support Syria here, and
Syria does not recognize Lebanon's sovereignty.'' Aoun claims the
40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon are an occupation force, and he has
vowed to drive them out.
   The Syrians intervened in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to
quell the civil war that broke out 18 months earlier. But Aoun
charges they violated that mandate by openly siding with the Moslems.
   The United States has repeatedly appealed for a cease-fire in
Lebanon, often calling on Syria to cooperate with peace efforts.
   But Washington has not helped arm Aoun or denounce Syria's latest
siege on the Christian heartland. The United States also has not
sent envoys to Lebanon to spur peace efforts, as France and the
Soviet Union have done.
   Police said the casualties Saturday raised the toll since
fighting broke out March 8 to at least 825 killed and 2,438 wounded.
   Eighteen people were killed and more than 100 wounded in 24 hours
of non-stop shelling that eased at midnight Friday, leaving
buildings in flames and streets choked with rubble.
   Aoun accused the United States of ``giving Syria one chance after
the other to strike at Lebanon militarily without even denouncing
any crime being committed in Lebanon.''
   The 54-year-old Maronite Catholic general said Washington's
policy in Lebanon ``is to scare off the Lebanese with the objective
of putting them under Syria's control to enable America to work out
a settlement to the Middle East crisis at Lebanon's expense.''
   He said the Soviet Union was ``exerting sincere efforts for peace
in Lebanon and the Middle East'' but charged that the United States
``does not accept Soviet involvement in the Mediterranean.''
   He declared: ``Syria has been besieging our coast for six months
and preventing fuel supplies from reaching us. Why do the Americans
permit this?''
   The fighting flared again before dawn after a four-hour lull.
   Police said Syrian artillery shelled the 28-mile stretch of
Mediterranean coastline controlled by Aoun's forces to maintain the
blockade of Christian ports. Syrian troops and their Moslem militia
allies ring the landward sides of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north of Beirut.
   Devastating shelling by both sides has driven all but an
estimated 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million population to flee the
city for refuge in south Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley in the east and
mountain resorts northeast of Beirut.
   Smoke billowed from the wooded hills southeast of Beirut, where
Syrian artillery batteries were hammered by Aoun's gunners in
pre-dawn battles.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the Druse Moslem suburb of Shweifat southeast of
Beirut took the brunt of the Christians' artillery barrage during
the night.
   Amin Jirdi, a Shweifat native, said the area was ``literally
plowed by shellfire'' from Christians that shattered houses, shops
and businesses.
   ``Several fires blazed out of control through the night. We hid
in a basement until early this morning when the intensity of the
shelling decreased and we managed to get out,'' Jirdi said.
   He was interviewed at the key highway junction at Khalde, three
miles south of Shweifat, as he drove his wife and two daughters
south in the family sedan loaded with mattresses, blankets and
clothes.

   A man was arrested Saturday after he called a
911 emergency number from a telephone booth at Los Angeles
International Airport and threatened to kill the president and vice
president, authorities said.
   Los Angeles police traced the call and arrested the 36-year-old
man while he still was talking to the emergency line operator, said
police Sgt. Diljeet Singh.
   Singh declined to reveal the man's name, saying he was
transferred to the custody of the U.S. Secret Service for
investigation. Los Angeles police did not file charges, Singh said.
   Officials with the Secret Service were not immediately available
for comment. A dispatcher reached at its Los Angeles office said he
was not authorized to discuss the matter but would try to have
someone who was return a phone message.
   The call was traced to the 200 block of World Way, which runs
through the airport, while the emergency line operator kept the man
on the line, Singh said.
   ``He basically said he intended to kill the president and the
vice president,'' the sergeant said.
   ``The officer at the scene said the gentleman appeared mentally
troubled. We take such incidents seriously and reported it to the
Secret Service,'' he said.
   Singh said the man was not armed and had no luggage or airline
tickets in his possession at the time of the incident. ``He gave no
motive. He just kept rambling on and on, saying he wanted to kill
them,'' Singh said.

<HEAD>Will Jim Bakker Return to Court?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker's wife blamed his emotional
collapse on a reaction to medication and a former PTL official said
there's ``no way'' Bakker faked the breakdown, but a federal
prosecutor called it ``awfully suspect.''
   Whatever the truth, the future of the TV evangelist's fraud and
conspiracy trial is in doubt while he undergoes evaluation at a
psychiatric hospital at the Federal Correctional Institution at
Butner.
   The judge sent Bakker, sobbing, disheveled and shackled in arm
and leg chains, to Butner on Thursday after his psychiatrist
testified he had been hallucinating, curled in a fetal position and
hiding his head under a couch in his lawyer's office.
   The collapse came in the fourth day of Bakker's trial.
Prosecutors allege Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds
to finance a lavish lifestyle. If convicted of all 24 charges
against him, Bakker would face 120 years in prison and more than $5
million in fines.
   Bakker's lawyers say he was not competent to continue with the
trial; a court observer said that even if Bakker is deemed competent
after the evaluation, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter will have
little choice but to declare a mistrial if the psychiatric
evaluation takes too long.
   ``I think the trial will resume at some point,'' said Mike
Scofield, a former federal prosecutor. ``I don't know if it will be
this jury because there could be a long continuance.''
   ``The problem then will be the difficulty of picking another
jury,'' Scofield said. Defense lawyers tried unsuccessfully for
months to move the trial out of Charlotte because of pretrial
publicity.
   Dr. Sally Johnson, Butner's chief of psychiatric services, said
evaluations of patients like Bakker typically take 30 days but can
take 45 days or longer. Scofield says the law bars holding Bakker
more than four months.
   Tammy Faye Bakker said Friday night her husband had suffered an
allergic reaction to an anti-depressant medication.
   ``There is no reason at all for Jim to be in prison,'' Mrs.
Bakker said after meeting with her husband for six hours. ``He just
literally had more (medication) than he could handle. I think Judge
Potter is being very unfair.'' Bakker's psychiatrist, Dr. Basil
Jackson, had told Potter he prescribed the sedative Xanax for Bakker
when the evangelist hallucinated Wednesday after a witness fainted.
   However, The Charlotte Observer on Saturday quoted Jackson as
saying the amount of medication Bakker had been given ``was
infinitesimal because I recognized his concern about overreaction.''
   Jackson had tried to persuade the judge to allow Bakker to enter
a private hospital, rather than the prison facility.
   Mrs. Bakker, a gospel singer who has co-starred with Bakker on
their talk-show style religious TV programs, denied that Bakker
faked his attack.
   ``If you had seen Mr. Bakker, you would know he doesn't perform.
He's just Jim, not a performer,'' she said.
   Don Hardister, former security chief at the multimillion-dollar
PTL television ministry, said the collapse was not Bakker's first.
   Hardister recalled that Bakker suffered an emotional breakdown
after his resignation from PTL in March 1987. Bakker called his
bodyguard to his Palm Springs, Calif., home at 3 a.m. and was
convinced Jerry Falwell had stolen the ministry from him. Falwell
temporarily ran the ministry after Bakker left.
   ``He was slumped over, looking real bad,'' Hardister recalled.
``He just kept saying, `He stole it. He stole it.''' Hardister said
he stayed up with Bakker for three nights, keeping razors and knives
away from him.
   ``I think he will recover but I don't think it will be quick,''
Hardister said. Asked if he thought Bakker was faking, Hardister
replied, ``No way.''
   Bakker, in his 1976 autobiography, wrote about another breakdown
he said he suffered in 1969, when he was part of Pat Robertson's TV
ministry.
   ``Problems loomed completely out of proportion to their actual
size,'' Bakker wrote. ``It seemed as if whatever little control I
had over myself might snap any minute, and I'd be floating in an
emotional stream unable to return. What if that happened? It seemed
like an endless cycle that I was helpless to stop.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller was skeptical when Bakker's
psychiatrist testified that Bakker could not continue the trial.
   On Wednesday, defense lawyer George T. Davis had called Bakker to
the witness stand to pray for prosecution witness Steve Nelson, a
former PTL vice president, who collapsed after giving incriminating
evidence about his boss.
   On Thursday, Miller told Potter: ``It's hard to interpret it in
any other way than Mr. Davis has once again _ this time he didn't
summon his client up to pray _ this time he summons a psychiatrist
up to say that his client can't go forward with the defense, and
it's awfully suspect.''
   Potter suspended the trial at least until Wednesday, telling the
jury nothing about Bakker's condition.

<DATELINE>MUENSTER, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IRA gunmen drove up to a British
military housing complex, asked two soldiers for directions and then
opened fire on them, wounding both, police said Saturday.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed reponsibility in a statement
made by telephone to a news agency in Dublin, Ireland.
   Police in the northwestern city of Muenster, about 110 miles
north of Bonn, said one soldier was in critical condition and the
other was seriously wounded.
   The shooting occurred late Friday in the village of Gremmendorf
near Muenster. It was the fourth attack on a British military
facility in West Germany since June.
   Muenster police spokesman Hans-Jochen Petzold said the soldiers
were walking in civilian clothes in a housing area for British
troops when a car pulled up and its occupants asked in English how
to reach Muenster.
   When the soldiers responded in English, one of the car's
occupants opened fire with an automatic rifle, the spokesman said.
   Pete Brown, a spokesman for the British Rhine Army, said the
soldiers, who are from the Manchester area, belong to the 14th-20th
King's Hussars. He said he could not release their identities for
security reasons.
   The IRA has repeatedly attacked British troops stationed in West
Germany in recent years in an extension of its guerrilla war in
Northern Ireland.
   The guerrilla group is fighting to oust Britain from the province
of Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish Republic.
   During attacks this summer on British forces in West Germany, one
soldier was killed in Hanover, and two car bombs exploded at British
military housing.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the fatal attack and is
suspected by police in the other one.
   A third car bomb planted in a soldier's car was found last week
and defused.

   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, the alluring
honey-blonde whose feisty nature and eight trips to the altar
command more attention than her occasional movie career, is taking
on the Beverly Hills police force.
   Miss Gabor goes on trial Sept. 11 on charges she slapped a
Beverly Hills motorcycle cop who she says roughed her up June 14
after stopping her $215,000 Rolls-Royce convertible on a busy
thoroughfare.
   ``I tell you mainly why I go to trial: that this shouldn't happen
to other women,'' Miss Gabor said during an interview at her Bel-Air
mansion.
   ``They wanted to drop all the charges. And the funny part is they
wanted to make, how do you call, civic work for 100 hours. And this
guy (Rob Lowe) who had pornographic movies, he only got 20 hours
(community service).''
   Miss Gabor has selected a black Valentino designer dress, black
hat and pearls ensemble for her courtroom battle against charges of
battery on a policeman, disobeying an officer, driving with an
expired license, having an open container of alcohol in her car and
having expired car registration.
   If convicted, she faces a maximum jail term of two years and a
$4,000 fine.
   Miss Gabor has tangled before with law enforcement.
   In January, authorities said, she spouted profanities when she
was taken off an airliner in Atlanta because her two dogs were loose
in the plane. The same thing happened in 1968 when she illegally
brought a dog with her to Spain.
   ``They dragged me off a plane with the dog and put me in jail for
a night,'' Miss Gabor said, adding incarceration wasn't so bad. ``I
spent the night in jail with this wonderful, gorgeous American
sailor and we had the best time. We laughed our head off.''
   She also recalled a run-in with a policeman in London.
   ``This is not the first policeman I hit. I hit one in London,''
she said. ``Then he said, `Come here, gorgeous girl, in my arms. A
woman who can hit an English policeman I love.' And he kissed me.
   ``The English are much more civilized.''
   ``Here in Beverly Hills, I was afraid of this policeman. I was
raised under Nazi occupation, Russian occupation, and I wasn't
afraid,'' she said.
   The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, who is secretive about her
age, looks much younger than her years _ reported to be between 62
and 70.
   ``I don't smoke. I don't drink. I have a good sex life. Why
shouldn't I be beautiful?'' she asks. ``You only die once. Enjoy
yourself.''
   Her trademark ``dahlink'' rarely emerged in Wednesday's
conversation about where she's been, what she's doing and where
she's going.
   Sisters Magda, Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor were groomed by mother Jolie
Gabor, who is 84, to be ``rich, famous and married to kings.'' Zsa
Zsa married a prince, among others.
   The former Miss Hungary was 16 when she married Burhan Belge, the
Turkish ambassador to Hungary.
   She also married hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, actor George
Sanders (who had previously been married to her sister Magda),
businessman Herbert Hutner, Texas oil magnate Joshua Gosden Jr.,
inventor Jack Ryan, lawyer Michael O'Hara and her current husband,
Prince Frederick von Anhalt, Germany's Duke of Saxony.
   Such matrimonial experience inspired Miss Gabor to write two
books _ ``Zsa Zsa's Complete Guide to Men'' and ``How to Get a Man,
How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man.''
   Visitors to her mustard yellow Santa Monica Mountains estate are
greeted by two barking German shepherds and three little dogs.
   ``I bought this (house) 12 years ago from Howard Hughes. It
looked terrible, like a whorehouse. It took two years to fix it
up,'' she said.
   Guests walk through the airy living room area, pass two
wood-carved carousel horses, a pair of 12-foot ficus trees and a
Mickey Mouse telephone to a 90-degree pool guarded by snarling
pottery leopards.
   In addition to real estate holdings _ the $15 million Bel-Air
estate, a Simi Valley, Calif., ranch and a Palm Beach, Fla., home _
Miss Gabor's cosmetics and jewelry businesses are making her rich in
her own right.
   In October, she will star as the owner of an animal beauty parlor
in ``Animal Haven,'' the latest of what she calls a 50-picture
career in Hollywood. Her movie credits include ``Moulin Rouge''
``Queen of Outer Space,'' ``Boys Night Out'' and ``Picture Mommy
Dead.''

<HEAD>FAA to Discourage Future Record Breakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials and aviation experts are
trying to discourage child pilots from trying record-breaking jaunts
like an 11-year-old's globe-trotting trip this summer.
   ``It leaves the public with the impression that there are a bunch
of kids flying around out there, and that's simply not the case,''
Gabe Bruno, general manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's
general aviation operations branch, said Friday.
   Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano, accompanied by his
licensed pilot father, Gary, became the youngest person to pilot a
plane around the world with his 22,000-mile jaunt from June 5
through July 22. The ``Friendship Flight'' included numerous stops
in the Soviet Union.
   In April 1988, when he was 9, Tony claimed a record as the
youngest person to fly across the United States, breaking the record
set the previous year by 10-year-old Christopher Lee Marshall of
Oceano, Calif.
   In July 1988, Christopher, by then 11, was back in the books,
claiming the record as the youngest person to fly the Atlantic.
   Bruno said federal laws cannot ban such flights, as long as a
licensed pilot is aboard and takes responsibility.
   ``I wouldn't say that there's a safety issue here,'' he said.
``It's an image type of thing.''
   The state Senate unanimously passed a resolution rewarding Tony
for his courage in piloting the single-engine Cessna. But the FAA
and private pilots withheld praise.
   A Seattle, Wash., pilot complained to Louis C. Cusimano, the
FAA's acting general aviation manager, and Cusimano wrote back: ``We
are concerned that these recent flights by youngsters may have
served to reduce public confidence in the safety of the aviation
system.
   ``Therefore, we will be actively working with general aviation
organizations and flight instructors to discourage such actions in
the future,'' Cusimano wrote in June in a letter the Los Angeles
Times obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
   A spokesman for the world's largest pilots' group said youngsters
should learn about flying through more legitimate channels like the
Boy Scouts and the Aviation Explorer program.
   ``These flights by young people tend to trivialize the flight
instruction process,'' said Frank White, spokesman for the
295,000-member Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
   The Aliengenas were vacationing in Utah during the weekend and
could not be reached for comment.
   The FAA still is investigating the July 18 crash of the
Aliengenas' plane in Golovin, Alaska. The crash occurred during a
fishing trip while father and son were taking a break from the
round-the-world voyage. Tony was on board but his father was at the
controls.
   Gary Aliengena told FAA investigators that he had mistaken a
taxiway for the runway and did not have enough room or speed to
become airborne. The Cessna was damaged but no one seriously
injured. The trip continued in a borrowed plane. The FAA is
considering disciplinary action against the elder Aliengena for
having too heavy a passenger load at the time.

   The bombing Saturday of the newspaper El
Espectador demonstrated once again the risks Colombian journalists
face when reporting on the country's cocaine industry.
   Guillermo Cano, the former editor of El Espectador, heads the
list of journalists in Colombia who have died in the fight against
drug traffickers.
   He was assassinated Dec. 17, 1986, while leaving the newspaper
building _ the same one heavily damaged by Saturday's bomb.
Authorities charged Pablo Escobar, the most powerful chief of the
Medellin cocaine cartel, with ordering and planning the slaying.
   Escobar, now in hiding, leads the list of 12 so-called
``extraditables'' _ people wanted on drug-related charges in the
United States.
   Cano wrote fiercely and consistently against the drug
traffickers, and the paper has continued the campaign since his
killing.
   In September 1986, assassins killed veteran anti-drug newsman
Raul Echavarria of the newspaper Occidente in Cali, another large
cocaine-producing city. No one has yet been convicted of the crime.
   Juan Gomez, now mayor of Medellin, the world's No. 1 cocaine
center, fought off a kidnap attempt in 1987 when he was the editor
of the El Colombiano newspaper there. The ``Extraditables'' claimed
responsibility.
   Gomez now is the sole leading Colombian political figure who
proposes negotiating with the drug cartels, a policy adamantly
opposed by President Virgilio Barco and the defense minister, Gen.
Oscar Botero.
   The front-running candidate for president in Colombian elections
set for next May, Luis Carlos Galan, also campaigned on an anti-drug
cartel platform. Drug gangs killed him on Aug. 18.
   Journalist Andres Pastrana left the directorship of an
independently produced Colombian network TV news program to run for
mayor of Bogota, the capital. The ``extraditables'' kidnapped him in
January 1988, but police rescued him a week later and he won the
election.
   In such a dangerous climate, many Colombian journalists have
opted for self-exile.
   They include Daniel Samper, one of the most popular columnists of
El Tiempo of Bogota, the nation's largest paper; and Mauricio Gomez,
the director of the nationally syndicated ``24 Hours'' nightly TV
news program. Both survived assassination attempts by drug gangs.
   News executives and controversial newsmen remaining in Colombia
have adopted elaborate personal security measures, establishing
private intelligence networks, contracting bodyguards and accepting
police protection of their homes.
   The police recently found and deactivated bombs at the Medellin
offices of Caracol and RCN, Colombia's two biggest private radio
networks.
   The ``extraditables'' specifically cite journalists among their
enemies in their proclaimed ``total and absolute war'' against
Colombians who oppose them.
   Still, owners of 25 Colombian newspapers told Barco on Thursday
they give ``full backing'' to recently decreed emergency measures
seeking to confiscate Colombian drug traffickers' fortunes and send
the ``extraditables'' to the United States.

<HEAD>Conservationist George Adamson Buried at His Kenyan Camp</HEAD>

   Slain conservationist George
Adamson was buried Saturday at this remote game reserve where he and
his wife, ``Born Free'' author Joy Adamson, gained fame for their
work with lions.
   The 83-year-old former game warden was killed by armed bandits on
Aug. 20, nine years after his wife was slain in a wage dispute with
a servant.
   About 60 of Adamson's friends and admirers, including
conservationists, diplomats and actors, traveled to the brief
service in small planes to his simple scrubland camp about 240 miles
east of Nairobi.
   An Anglican priest led the burial procession to the gravesite, a
sandy hillside of acacia trees and bush above the Tana River.
Adamson's brother, Terence, is also buried there.
   Adrian House, chairman of the Elsa Wild Animal Appeal and the
Adamsons' publisher, eulogized Adamson as a man who ``when he feared
death, looked it in the face and didn't flinch.''
   ``Elsa'' is the name of the lion featured in ``Born Free.'' The
Adamsons taught dozens of lions orphaned or born in captivity to
survive in the wild.
   Adamson and two assistants died in a spray of gunfire as they
went to the rescue of another assistant and a house guest who had
been attacked by gunmen near the camp.
   The gunmen, apparently robbers, turned their fire on Adamson when
he tried to run them over in his Land Rover.
   In his eulogy, House challenged the mourners to carry on
Adamson's work.
   He referred to a passage in Adamson's autobiography, ``My Pride
and Joy,'' in which Adamson asks: ``Who will raise their voices,
when mine is carried away in the wind, to plead Kora's case?''
   ``It is up to us, all of us, to share in efforts to answer
George's cry,'' said House.
   Last week, a friend of Adamson, 71-year-old Douglas Collins,
moved to Kora with an assistant to oversee the park, which is home
to about 16 lions Adamson released there.
   Richard Leakey, Kenya's wildlife director, accompanied Adamson's
body in an air force helicopter from Nairobi to Kora National Park.
   In brief comments before Adamson's burial, he pledged Kenya's
commitment to wiping out the violence that has claimed the life of
Adamson and killed three tourists in similar attacks since June.
   ``It will come to an end and we will have peace in our parks,''
he said.
   After a 12-man honor guard from the Department of Wildlife fired
three volleys into the air and game rangers played a trumpet
rendition of ``The Last Post,'' Adamson's simple wooden coffin was
lowered into the ground next to his brother's grave.
   Among those at the service were Sir John Johnson, Britain's high
commissioner in Kenya; and Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna, a
British couple who played the Adamsons in a movie version of ``Born
Free.''

<HEAD>Boy Rescued From Sewer System After Being Swept Away In Storm Rains</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Stands for Undated item on the AM-News Advisory.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old boy swept into a storm sewer
by a rainstorm said it seemed like hours before he was able to get
the attention of a passer-by by screaming through a manhole grate.
   Friday's incident took place during a flood warning when the area
was deluged by as much as 4 inches of rain, officials said.
   Jason Gephart and several other children were playing near a
drainage ditch area that empties into the storm sewer system running
underneath the city, said police Lt. Joe Mink.
   ``My brother was about to fall in,'' Jason said by telephone on
Saturday. ``He accidentally hit me and I went (in).''
   From there Jason said he was ``underwater for about 10 minutes,''
as the swift currents swept him along.
   ``I was sliding ...,'' he said. ``I was hitting my head on top,
and going real fast.''
   The ordeal took about half an hour, but ``it seemed like about
two hours,'' Jason said. The second-grader said during the time he
worried ``I'd never see my mom again.''
   Police said he had traveled about 1,200 feet through a 36-inch
pipe before he spotted a manhole above.
   ``There was this one hole I was trying to climb up and fell
down,'' Jason said. But he had better luck on another manhole.
   ``There was a 13-inch hole; I climbed up it,'' Jason said.
``Somebody was walking to his mom's. I was saying `Help! Help!' I
put my arm up.''
   The passer-by, a teen-ager who was not identified, pulled Jason
from the manhole, officials said.
   Friday's storms dumped up to 8 inches of rain on parts of the
Midwest. High winds damaged about 40 homes in Indiana and spawned
two reported tornados, officials said.
   In Illinois, residents on Saturday repaired damage caused by
thunderstorms that crisscrossed the state Friday, dumping up to 7
inches of rain, causing power outages and thwarting air and road
traffic.
   Three people were injured, none seriously, in Indiana's Pulaski
County. The homes were damaged in Pulaski and neighboring Fulton
County, including one mobile home that was flipped over by strong
winds.
   After his rescue, Jason was taken to Clinton County Hospital,
treated for cuts and bruises and released. His advice to children
playing in storm water is, ``I'll say get away from it, 'cause I
fell in.''
   His stepfather, Michael Lanum, said the family would go to church
Sunday to offer thanks for the boy's rescue.
   ``We never had this much rain. I've been here for 28 years and
haven't seen this much,'' Lanum said. ``They had like a screen or
something over the pipe. I guess it washed away.''
   Mink estimated about 4 inches fell Friday.
   ``You don't know how much I aged by this incident,'' added the
officer, who has a 5-year-old son himself.
   Jason said, ``everybody's been calling to see how I am, that I'm
all right.''
   Frankfort is a town of 15,000 about 40 miles northwest of
Indianapolis in the central part of the state. Pulaski and Fulton
Counties are in the northern part of the state.

<HEAD>Researchers Using Video Game To Educate About AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Blocky'' is not going to threaten Nintendo's
hold on the youth of America, but a couple of researchers from the
University of Texas are hoping the video-game creature helps protect
young people from AIDS.
   ``Blocky'' is the hero in ``BLOCKAIDS,'' a video game youngsters
can play at the Houston Museum of Medical Science. Players score
points by correctly answering questions about acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The game also allows players to look up AIDS information in the
computer in the form of ``hints'' that help them answer the
multiple-choice questions correctly. A correct answer gleaned from
hints brings the youngster some points, but fewer than a correct
answer gotten right off the bat.
   ``We decided on a game as opposed to other, more traditional
methods of teaching, because we felt adolescents would be more
receptive to a game,'' said Craig Johnson, associate professor of
biomedical communications at the University of Texas Health Science
Center at Houston.
   ``How many teen-agers are actually going to read the surgeon
general's reports on AIDS?''
   Johnson and Bill Fetter, a fellow researcher and assistant
professor, came up with the game idea, a kind of video tic-tac-toe.
When a player gives a correct answer, ``Blocky'' zaps an evil AIDS
virus who previously rested in the square. Completion of a row sends
the player to a new screen and the opportunity to score more points.
   Fetter said the tic-tac-toe concept was selected because kids
already know how to play the game.
   ``If we created an entirely new design, we would spend more time
teaching them how to play the game than teaching them about AIDS,''
Fetter said.
   ``It was apparent there is a strong need for AIDS education,''
Johnson said. ``An entire generation could be at risk. There was a
need to put this into a format that would grab and hold the
attention of adolescents. We wanted to make a contribution.''
   On their own time and at their own expense, Fetter and Johnson
and two school graduates assembled the game during evenings and on
weekends.
   ``Our perception is it's the first game of its kind in AIDS
education and the first to be based on the surgeon general's report
on AIDS,'' Fetter said.
   The game has been part of a hands-on display at the museum since
March. The computer program, which also asks general demographic
data like age, race and sex, is set up to record the answers of
people who play it so researchers can analyze the data and identify
those facets of the disease most misunderstood.
   ``At this point, we don't have a good handle on the impact,''
Johnson said. ``We've just started collecting the data.''
   In coming up with the design, a block for the hero made sense
``because we were looking at blocking AIDS,'' Fetter said. They also
gave him boxing gloves and running shoes.
   The villain AIDS virus, with bloodshot eyes and an evil toothy
grimace, is not unlike a microscopic representation of the real AIDS
virus, he said.
   The 250 questions are pulled from the surgeon general's report on
AIDS. Johnson, an educational psychologist, said repeating some of
the questions promotes retention.
   Typical of questions is whether AIDS is on the increase, or how
does one contract AIDS, or is it possible to get AIDS by merely
being in a tent with an AIDS carrier. (It is not.)
   ``One of the issues we're dealing with is that we felt there are
a lot of myths about AIDS,'' Johnson said.
   Although the museum game, powered by an IBM computer, is a
one-of-a-kind now, he said it has the potential for use in school
computers. It also is designed so new information about AIDS can be
inserted easily.
   ``This is in a museum, but displays like this could be in lots of
other plays, like shopping malls, convenience stores, military bases
and school cafeterias,'' Johnson said. ``They need to be put in
places where people need the help most.''

   Director Barry Levinson will be filming a
multigeneration family epic here next week and his casting company
is placing a high premium on authenticity.
   Gregg Mason and Pat Moran run a Baltimore casting company that is
searching for 5,000 ``Baltimore faces'' to serve as extras in
director Levinson's as-yet-untitled film, which will star Aidan
Quinn and Elizabeth Perkins.
   The pair and their assistants have examined thousands of
portraits of everyday people _ piled in stacks with such lables as
``night club'' and ``firemen, policemen, delivery men, mailmen,
waiters, nurses'' _ in search of just the right look.
   ``We see every single photo that comes through here,'' Mason
said. ``We're never bored with looking at a photo. Each one is
hand-picked,'' he added. ``When you see a great face, it's like a
discovery.''
   It's as much an attitude as a look that tells Mason and Moran, a
long-time friend and colleague of Baltimore filmmaker John Waters,
that they have a Baltimore face in hand.

   Riot police using whips and clubs
attacked anti-apartheid protesters who tried to march to Parliament
on Saturday, arresting 450 people and injuring dozens.
   The march was planned as part of a nationwide campaign to defy
apartheid laws. The movement has intensified in the days leading up
to Wednesday's parliamentary elections, which exclude the black
majority.
   In one dramatic incident, a young white activist climbed atop a
mobile water cannon that was spraying purple-dyed water at the
protesters. He turned the hose away so that it sprayed an office
building housing offices of the ruling National Party, scuffled with
a policeman, then ran into the crowd.
   Police were heard giving orders that anyone seen with purple dye
on their clothes should be detained.
   Among the estimated 450 protesters arrested was the Rev. Allan
Boesak, a prominent mixed-race activist who is president of the
World Alliance of Reformed Churches. Police said 52 journalists,
many of them foreign reporters, also were arrested when police
invoked emergency regulations barring on-scene coverage of unrest.
   The protesters and 50 of the journalists were released several
hours later. It was not clear if the protesters would be charged
later with joining an illegal gathering.
   Two crewmen for the London-based Visnews television network were
told they would be held and charged.
   Dozens were reported injured. After the police action, more than
1,500 protesters, some injured and others soaked in purple dye,
crowded into St. George's Cathedral for a service led by Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   ``All moral right is on your side,'' Tutu told the multi-racial
throng. ``We have committed ourselves to this struggle until freedom
is won.''
   Near the end of the service, Tutu asked the crowd to repeat after
him, ``We shall be free, all of us together, black and white, in a
free South Africa.''
   The South African Council of Churches, to which Tutu and Boesak
are affiliated, said in a statement that the government ``has
declared an open war on the church and the people.''
   At least two large groups of protesters began separate marches in
the city center before being dispersed. One group of about 700 sat
down in a street bordering a market square crowded with shoppers and
sang a freedom song as the water cannon was brought in.
   Another group, led by Boesak, set out from St. George's Cathedral
before police moved in, beating and whipping the marchers and using
tear gas.
   Before his arrest, Boesak said many people who wanted to join the
march had been stopped at police roadblocks while trying to leave
outlying black and mixed-race townships.
   Journalists said police arrested several medics trying to treat
injured protesters, and at one point took away both medics and
patients at a temporary clinic.
   Police raided at least one television news bureau, arrested a CBS
cameraman at his hotel room, and detained journalists and
photographers working for numerous South African and foreign news
media, including The Associated Press, NBC, Reuters and the
independent South African Press Association.
   A TV crew from the state-controlled South African Broadcasting
Corp. was also detained during the round-up.
   
   A Law and Order Ministry spokesman, Brig. Leon Mellet, said: ``We
cannot allow these propaganda efforts by the Mass Democratic
Movement (organizer of the defiance campaign) to tarnish South
Africa's image abroad, where a destructive view is being created by
totally slanted reports emanating from South Africa.''
   The march was one of the major events planned this weekend by the
Mass Democratic Movement. Police banned a rally scheduled for
Saturday in Soweto and reported that white right-wing extremists had
set off bombs near a whites-only beach in Durban where blacks and
Indians plan a mass sit-in on Sunday.
   The defiance campaign began Aug. 2 and has intensified as the
elections approach. The black majority is excluded from Parliament.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, quoted government
sources Saturday as saying that 17 leaders of the defiance campaign
had been detained and 13 others were being sought, including some
who had gone into hiding.
   In Soweto, the township of 2.5 million blacks, scores of
policemen and soldiers were stationed at Jabulani Stadium, where
Saturday's ``peace rally'' had been scheduled to take place.
Security forces also ringed a nearby Roman Catholic church which in
the past has been used an alternative site for banned outdoor
rallies.
   In Durban, police said several small bombs exploded overnight in
trash bins along the port city's beachfront. Pamphlets left by the
bins denounced the plans by activists to stage a sit-in Sunday on
the whites-only section of the beach.
   According to police headquarters, more than 440 protesters were
arrested across the country Friday, including Tutu, his wife, Leah,
and Boesak's wife, Dorothy. Those three were among 36 people
arrested and later released while marching to protest the beating of
church workers during a demonstration earlier Friday in Cape Town.

   Warning signs failed to prevent cars from
hitting moose on western Maine's ``Moose Highway,'' so game wardens
are now resorting to a rotten-egg spray to keep the lumbering
animals at bay.
   A material known as Putrascent has been used with limited success
in Canadian parks to keep deer and moose away from roadways, said
biologist Ronald Joseph of the Maine Warden Service.
   Beginning this week, the spray will be used at six locations
along U.S. Route 201 between this western Maine outpost and the
Canadian border.
   The spray has an egg-compound base that is barely noticeable to
humans, although it repels moose.
   Wardens plan to check the six test sites for moose tracks before
and after Putrascent is used to see how effective the stinky
repellent is, said Joseph. Officials say that moose are so big and
heavy _ 500 to 700 pounds, typically _ that a car hitting one can be
a real danger for the car's occupants.
   Six signs erected along the highway to warn motorists of
potential moose confrontations have had little effect. Joseph said
part of the problem was that they were written in English and not in
French, the language of neighboring Quebec. Another problem was
theft; two of the signs were stolen.
   Many motorists who have hit moose say they thought the moose
warning signs were advertisements for the area, according to Marcia
Seavey, administrator of the Jackman Health Center. Moose River is
between Jackman and the Quebec border, and many local businesses are
named in honor of the moose.

   ``The Speaker'' is a powerful Chicago
Democrat with blue eyes, brown hair and the look of an Irish
Republican Army commando. ``The Guv'' is a Republican, nicknamed
``His Tallness,'' seeking a fourth term in office.
   They become locked in a bizarre political chess game after two
supporters of a little-known political extremist stage upset
victories in Illinois' 1986 Democratic primary.
   But the end of this tale lies not in recent history but in a
murder mystery written by a Sangamon State University political
scientist who uses the news of the day and his knowledge of Illinois
politics to shape his paperback detective novels.
   ``As I look at the paper every day I'm discarding or adding to my
mental file things that I could conceivably use,'' says David
Everson, whose third novel, ``Rematch,'' spins a tale of murder and
political intrigue starting with the election upset.
   Though the book is labeled fiction, readers familiar with
Illinois politics will find more than a few parallels with living,
breathing politicians.
   Illinois' Speaker of the House is Michael Madigan, a Chicago
Democrat with brown hair, blue eyes and an Irish ancestry. Gov.
James R. Thompson, a 6-foot-6 Republican, is currently serving his
fourth term.
   Two followers of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche did win
nominations for lieutenant governor and secretary of state in the
1986 Democratic primary. They were quickly disowned by the party and
lost the general election.
   The central character in ``Rematch'' and its predecessors,
``Recount'' and ``Rebound,'' is Robert Miles, a private investigator
who, like his creator, is a jogger with an inordinate fondness for
soft drinks. In ``Rematch,'' Miles investigates the far-right party
which has landed two of its devotees on the Democratic ticket.
   Though his novels often begin with real-life events, Everson
said, ``I never leave it at that. What I do is take that premise
and, like with the characters, exaggerate it ... always thinking of
course that I'm writing a mystery.''
   A fourth book is to be published next year and a fifth is in the
works. But Everson says he's not getting rich off his novels.
   ``The best advice I heard given to beginning mystery writers was,
`Keep your daytime job,''' he said.

<HEAD>Communists Confirm Being Offered More Than Two Ministries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist leaders, praising the new
Solidarity prime minister as a ``realist,'' said Saturday they have
been offered more than the two posts already promised them in
Tadeusz Mazowiecki's new government.
   Party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and Communist parliamentary
leader Marian Orzechowski made the remarks after a morning meeting
with Mazowiecki, who is expected to unveil his new government by
Sept. 10.
   ``Today Premier Mazowiecki presented his (government) concept and
it is in my opinion a realistic concept, such as would be suitable
for our party,'' Rakowski said in an interview on state television
and radio.
   The tone of his remarks appeared to indicate the Communists are
satisfied with their lot in the new government and will not raise
any last-minute objections.
   Rakowski confirmed the party has been offered more than just the
defense and internal affairs portfolios, which control the army and
the police. He would not elaborate on what the posts were.
   Solidarity guaranteed the Communists the first two posts prior to
Mazowiecki's Aug. 24 election as the first non-Communist prime
minister in the Soviet bloc.
   Of Mazowiecki, Rakowski said: ``I think he is a realist. He looks
on the situation in Poland realistically, including the process of
forming the government.''
   In addition to the Communists, Mazowiecki must balance the
interests of Solidarity and his two minor coalition partners, the
United Peasant and Democratic parties.
   There was no immediate statement about Saturday's meeting from
Mazowiecki's office.
   The prime minister has been holding a near-constant series of
talks with various political leaders in the past week on forming the
government, but has generally avoided public comment on them.
   In addition to what they have been promised, the Communists also
want the ministry of foreign affairs. Also, Solidarity parliamentary
leader Bronislaw Geremek has said the Communists should have to take
at least one economic ministry, so they can share responsibility for
unpopular economic reform.
   ``If ... we receive the place in the country and social life
appropriate to our political power, and portfolios which confirm
this place, then the party will have to be active in co-governing
and extend support to steps to lift Poland out of economic and
political crisis,'' Rakowski said.

   President Bush went fishing Saturday
but once again came home empty-handed.
   The vacationing president has vowed to break the dry spell before
he returns to Washington on Monday after 20 days at his family's
summer home here.
   The president and Barbara Bush hosted a private picnic Saturday
at the 11-acre Walker's Point compound for White House reporters and
their families.
   Later, Bush planned another crack at the bluefish that have
eluded him despite nearly daily outings since Aug. 16 on his
speedboat Fidelity.
   Bush has passed part of every summer of his life here at this
rustic seaside resort except in 1944, when he was a Navy pilot
fighting World War II.
   Saturday was the 45th anniversary of the day his Navy Avenger
bomber was shot down in the Pacific over Chi Chi Jima. His two
crewmen perished, but a passing American submarine rescued the
20-year-old aviator.
   Ten striking Eastern Airlines pilots picketed along Ocean Avenue
near Bush's residence, asking the president to intervene in their
bitter labor dispute. They wore their black-and-white captains'
uniforms under a blazing sun.

<HEAD>Court Allows Children to Inherit from Tobacco Heiress' Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slaying of tobacco heiress Margaret
Benson by her son should not keep his children from getting a share
of her $10 million estate, a state appeals court ruled.
   The 2nd District Court of Appeal on Friday upheld a Circuit Court
decision guaranteeing an inheritance for the three young children of
Steven Benson.
   Both courts rejected arguments that a state law barring killers
from profiting from the wills of their victims could be applied to
Benson's children.
   Benson, 38, murdered his mother and his adopted brother Scott
Benson and disfigured his sister, Carol Benson Kendall, in July 1985
by exploding two pipe bombs in Mrs. Benson's car in the driveway of
the family's posh Naples home.
   Mrs. Benson's will ordered her estate to be equally divided among
her three children. With Scott Benson dead and Steven Benson
disqualified by state law as an heir, his children claimed a half
share of the estate.
   Mrs. Kendall challenged the will, charging the children should be
ineligible for the inheritance because of their father's crimes.
   An added twist to the case was the fact that Scott Benson was
actually Mrs. Kendall's illegitimate son; he had been adopted by her
mother, Mrs. Benson. So he was Mrs. Benson's biological grandson but
legally her son and heir and aldo legally a brother of his
biological mother.
   Attorney Marjorie Starnes, who represented the three children's
interests in the estate, was jubilant about the latest decision.
   ``It means the children can now have an education and a secure
future,'' she said. ``I am thrilled beyond description.''
   The appeals court said in a seven-page opinion that state law
restricts inheritances for those who intentionally kill another
person, but ``it is the surviving person who kills who is prohibited
from benefiting from the act of killing.''
   Attorney Bert Pena, who handled Mrs. Kendall's appeal, said he
was disappointed in the outcome. He had not read the opinion and
could not say if the case would be appealed again.
   Benson's children are living with their mother, Debra, out of
state because ``they need to be far away from the stigma'' of the
case, Ms. Starnes said. All three are kindergarten age or younger.
   When federal taxes, probate and other costs are deducted, the
three children stand to share about $2 million, said estate executor
Carl Westman. The same amount would go to Mrs. Kendall.
   Benson was sentenced to two life terms on two counts of
first-degree murder. The prosecution charged he feared being cut out
of his mother's will after she became outraged over his heavy
spending on drugs and his personal life.
   Mrs. Benson was an heiress to the Lancaster Leaf Tobacco Co.
fortune of Lancaster, Pa.

   Thousands of people rallied in the Azerbaijan
republic on Saturday to demand control of a disputed region that is
also claimed by the neighboring republic of Armenia, an activist
said.
   The activist group People's Front of Azerbaijan staged the rally
and also called for a strike Monday at factories, offices, schools
and businesses throughout the southern republic, said front member
Aiden Amirbekov.
   He said 1 million people turned out for Saturday's rally. Nazim
Ragimov, an independent journalist and activist, said about 500,000
people attended.
   Amirbekov said the protesters are demanding that Moscow lift its
direct control over the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. The
region has been the site of clashes between ethnic Armenians and
Azerbaijanis.
   Activists in neighboring Armenia want to annex the region, where
about 75 percent of the population is ethnic Armenian.
   The Kremlin assumed direct control of the region in January in an
attempt to end the dispute.
   In the telephone interview, Amirbekov said Saturday's protesters
jammed Lenin Square in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, carrying blue,
red and gold Azerbaijan flags and signs demanding an end to
interference by the Kremlin in the republic's affairs.
   During the protest, some people carried signs saying ``Stop
interfering in Azerbaijan's affairs,'' ``Karabakh is aggression
against the sovereignty of Azerbaijan,'' Amirbekov said.
   The rally was peaceful, and authorities made no effort to break
it up, he said.
   Officials at the republic's Interior and Foreign Affairs
ministries, reached by telephone, declined comment on the rally.
Telephones at the official Azerinform news agency did not answer.
   Clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis have killed 100 people
and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes.
   The Azerbaijan People's Front carried out a brief strike in late
August and then called it off to await the government's reaction and
plan a larger walkout.
   The official Tass news agency reported Saturday that the
Azerbaijan government rejected as unconstitutional a declaration of
independence by a council of Armenian activists in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In its report, Tass said the Presidium of the Azerbaijan Supreme
Soviet, the republic's highest executive body, met after Armenian
activists made their independence declaration in Stepanakert,
Nagorno-Karabakh's biggest city.
   The news agency did not say when the Armenians met.
   The Azerbaijan authorities found the move to be ``an infringement
on government authority and an unconstitutional act'' aimed at
trying to seize power, Tass said.
   In another ethnic dispute, the national Supreme Soviet made a
move apparently designed to meet the demands of ethnic strikers in
the Moldavia republic.
   Tass said the national body formed a committee to study the
political and social situation in Moldavia. Strikers have demanded
such a move.
   The legislature of Moldavia approved legislation Thursday making
Moldavian the official language.
   Ethnic Russians and other Russian-speaking ethnic groups had
demanded that Russian be recognized as a second official language.
Russian-speaking workers have been on strike at 200 enterprises to
protest the language law.
   A man who answered the telephone at strike headquarters in the
Moldavia city of Tiraspol said the national commission was expected
to visit on Monday or Tuesday, and that strikers would decide after
the visit whether to go back to work.
   In the Ukrainian republic, a Moscow activist reported that
thousands of people gathered at rallies to demand stricter residency
requirements in a local election law.
   Anatoly Dotsenko said crowds of up to 50,000 people gathered in
the capital of Kiev, Lvov and Dneprodzerzhinsk, and smaller crowds
rallied elsewhere in protests organized by members of the Congress
of People's Deputies national parliament.
   He said they were demanding that the law impose residency
requirements and drop a section allowing national officials whose
jurisdiction includes the Ukraine to run for its legislature, even
if they live elsewhere.
   The ethnic unrest and intense nationalism sweeping the Soviet
Union has been resulted largely from the greater openness encouraged
by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Rocket Attacks on Capital Kill Up to 46</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas fired a barrage of rockets
into the capital's airport and main bazaar Saturday, killing as many
as 46 people and injuring dozens of others, officials and state
radio said.
   The Kabul Airport was closed to civilian traffic after 10 people
died in the heaviest attack in a year, including ground workers and
staff of the national airline Ariana, said Naqib Sameer, a
government spokesman. He said at least 22 people were injured.
   Witnesses said one rocket thumped down just 20 yards from the
terminal.
   The attack began at mid-morning and continued sporadically throug
the day. Government forces fired back from multi-barrelled rocket
launchers stationed around the airport, a joint civilian and
military facility.
   President Najib later used the airport to leave for the
non-aligned nations summit in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
   A trickle of military traffic resumed at mid-afternoon.
   Sameer said four rockets hit the bazaar, sending flames through
the area. State-run Kabul Radio said 36 people were killed and 30
wounded. The broadcast was monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan.
   There were no claims of responsibility. The radio broadcast
blamed ``opposition elements financed by the United States and
Pakistan,'' a reference anti-communist rebels fighting to topple the
ruling Marxist government.
   Sameer said a rocket hit an alley of clothing stores near the
Kabul river, behind the Kartparian Mosque.
   Firefighters emerged with one corpse on a narrow bed of wood.
They held the blood-soaked body in the air for several minutes when
the ambulance door stuck and had to be pried open with a crowbar.
   Smoke clogged the bazaar and spewed out over the city. Merchants
scurried to save box after box of winter parkas from the water
gushing from leaky hoses. Kabul has been under almost daily rocket
attacks since June, but the attacks Saturday followed a three-week
lull.
   More than 300 people have been killed and 900 injured in the
attacks since June.
   In other fighting, Sameer reported government troops locked in
combat with the Pakistani-based mujahadeen rebels near Khost, 18
miles from the border.
   He said the rebels were firing rockets into downtown Khost and
onto the airport five miles from the provincial capital. The
government needs the airport to supply its troops as guerrillas
control the road to the capital.
   In Pakistan, the Mujahedeen Press Agency said the army had failed
to retake Dargi, a military post about 10 miles southeast of Khost.
It said seven soldiers were killed. The Afghan government also
reported seven killled.
   Diplomatic sources said the mujahedeen attack on Khost appeared
to be the most organized in years.
   Sameer said government troops had successfully mopped up guerilla
positions in the southeastern Kandahar province near the towns of
Torkotal, Makwan and Zargargar.
   The rebels, supported by the United States, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia, have been seeking to overthrow the Soviet-backed government
in Kabul for 10 years.
   The Soviet Union withdrew the bulk of its forces from Afghanistan
after nine years there in February under a U.N.-sponsored accord.
   The guerrillas have failed in their objective of capturing a
provincial capital to name as a seat for their provisional
government.
   They have refused to negotiate with Najib over his plan for a
six-month cease-fire to be followed by elections.

<HEAD>New Panama President Says He Wants Better U.S. Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new president met with government
officials Saturday to form a Cabinet after calling for better U.S.
relations. But he ruled out elections until Washington lifts
economic sanctions.
   Provisional President Francisco Rodriguez, in a speech late
Friday before his first day in office, said, ``I am sure there are
many important interests of the United States that can be compatible
with the national interests of Panama without undermining their
prestige or sacrificing our dignity.''
   He said he would lead the country to ``a new democracy as soon as
American aggression ceases and the funds arbitrarily withheld by the
United States government are returned to the national treasury, so
that conditions of institutional normality can be re-established.''
   He also called for ``a guarantee that elections can be held
without foreign interference and manipulation.''
   The United States has frozen about $300 million in Panamanian
assets in an effort to topple Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the power
behind the civilian government. Washington has also been withholding
Panama Canal fees since early 1988 and has imposed trade sanctions
that include a ban on any payments, including taxes, to the
Panamanian government.
   U.S. Embassy officials said Friday the American government is
compiling a list of companies and individuals associated with
Noriega for the purpose of blocking them from doing any business
with any Americans.
   The U.S. government considers Rodriguez a puppet of Noriega, who
commands Panama's police and military. The United States launched
its anti-Noriega campaign after he was indicted by two federal grand
juries in Florida on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988.
   Noriega denies those charges.
   Rodriguez met Saturday with leaders of the government's
Revolutionary Democratic Party and other officials to try to form a
Cabinet.
   In his speech Friday night, Rodriguez called on the U.S.
government ``to rid itself of the inventions and myths created by
... previous adminstrations.''
   ``If we look at our differences in terms of the real world and
without capricious fantasies, the many aspirations we share have
made possible our long association, including our alliance in two
world wars,'' he said.
   He also asked for Latin American solidarity, urging South
American governments to resist U.S. pressures to condemn Panama.
   Venezuela and Costa Rica have asked for Noriega's resignation. At
least eight Latin American countries have withdrawn ambassadors
since the May 7 elections in a sign of displeasure with the
government's decision to annul the vote.
   International observers say the opposition won those elections in
a landslide. The government annulled them.
   Also Saturday, the European Economic Community, in a statement
issued in Paris, said the administration in Panama is ``without
institutional legitimacy.'' It called for a solution that would
allow the Panamanian people to choose their own government.
   Rodriguez, 50, was named president by the Panama's Council of
State. He was inaugurated in a brief ceremony Friday, when the
previous administration's term expired.

   Ocie Mills and his son Carey are strictly
minor leaguers when it comes to polluting the nation's waterways.
   But they are near the top of the list in stubbornness, and that's
why they are in prison while much bigger polluters are not, says a
lawyer for the Army Corps of Engineers.
   ``Most usually work it out short of trial'' by agreeing to pay
fines and repairing environmental damage, said Mike Rossiter in a
recent telephone interview from the Corps' district headquarters in
Jacksonville. ``They wanted their day in court and they got it.''
   Ocie Mills, a 55-year-old retired contractor, and his 31-year-old
son are serving 21-month sentences in the federal prison camp at
Saufley Field, a Navy installation outside this Florida Panhandle
city.
   The father and son are two of only five federal prisoners serving
time for polluting, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. They
also are the first polluters convicted under a new law that takes
sentencing discretion away from judges.
   A jury last January convicted them of violating environmental law
by dumping several truckloads of fill on wetlands in neighboring
Santa Rosa County. They also were convicted of illegally dredging a
canal on the property, two small lots on which they had planned to
build a house for Carey.
   The Millses insist the fill was dumped on uplands rather than
wetlands, that they were only cleaning out an existing drainage
ditch rather than dredging, that they didn't need Corps permission
to do either. In any case, they said, they caused no pollution.
   ``We believe there are some politics in it,'' said the elder
Mills, who ran unsuccessfully for the Florida House last year and
has frequently been at loggerheads with state and federal
authorties. But he admits he cannot prove various conspiracy
theories he espouses to explain his plight.
   He believes government is butting in where it doesn't belong by
trying to tell people what they can and cannot do with their
property.
   Their case has become a cause celebre among friends and the
right-wing John Birch Society, of which they are members. Their
supporters have written numerous letters to the editors of
newspapers and raised about $3,000 for legal fees.
   But Rossiter makes no apology, saying the Millses failed to take
advantage of opportunities to settle the case, daring authorities to
take them to court.
   ``We consider all violations, no matter how small violations,''
he said. ``They were blatant violators, flagrant violators.''
   If officials looked the other way, Rossiter said, neighbors would
do the same thing, eventually destroying wetlands that filter
pollutants from the water and serve as a nursery for marine life.
   The Millses could be free men and they would have been allowed to
build the house on stilts to protect the wetlands if only they had
cooperated, he said.
   DER has filed suit against the Millses to force them to restore
the property. The pair have countersued, accusing the agency of
conspiracy. A state judge has heard the case but not yet ruled.
   The Millses are appealing the criminal convictions.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q: Eminence, how will this matter of the Carmelite nuns in
Auschwitz be resolved? Cardinal Macharski has visited the pope in
Rome...
   A: Oh, we will resolve it, we will resolve it. With patience. One
needs to reflect a bit. There are some Jewish circles who have let
themselves be carried away by nerves.
   Q: In your opinion, what irked Jews the most in the words you
spoke in Czestochowa?''
   A: Perhaps there are various points. They disliked that I said
they have great influence on the mass media.
   Q: And also that you said that their demands concerning the
Auschwitz Carmelite convent are excessive.
   A: Yes, because it's a scandal to expel the nuns from the
convent. What do we have to do? Put them in tents? Who do the nuns
offend by praying next to the wall of the concentration camp? The
land they are on is land where Catholics, let's say Christians, were
martyred. I don't understand why they should be transferred. Do you?
Our people don't understand. The Jews should understand that
devoting oneself to a life of prayer near the place were Christians
were martyred doesn't offend their feelings.
   Q: And instead, you feel offended for having to move the
Carmelite convent 5OO meters!
   A: Yes, this is offensive, because it's an irrational gesture.
Suppose I came to your house and said: you have to move this
wardrobe. You rightly would respond: stupid, this is my property.
   Q: But this accord on the transfer was signed in Geneva two years
ago by eminent members of the clergy....
   A: No, by Cardinal Macharski and by a group of people who are not
competent (in the matter).
   Q: What do you mean? Weren't the Cardinal of Paris, Lustiger, and
of Lyon, Decourtray, and of Brussels, Danneels, there?
   A: I want this accord to be renegotiated. It has to be done by
competent people and not by just any cardinal who doesn't understand
the things.
   Q: So Macharski did not understand?
   A: Cardinal Macharski didn't understand the situation of the
people.
   Q: So what do we do now?
   A: Everything needs to be renegotiated, with calm, with dialogue,
the way I propose. It has to be re-examined, but by competent
people. And the Poles can not be excluded.
   Q: But was Macharski, who negotiated, not a Pole?
   A: Macharski alone? What do you mean? He represents only the
church of Krakow. The problem is much more vast.
   Q: So, you don't approve of what Macharski did!
   A: I can believe that Macharski signed because things were done a
little too hastily.
   Q: Fine, but then this ecumenical center next to the Auschwitz
camp, will that be built or not?
   A: Do you know how much this center costs? Someone has made this
commitment, but without money the center cannot be built. For now
there is no money.
   Q: In fact there is only a sign on that land which reads: ``Here
the center will be built.'' Isn't that a bit little, two years after
the Geneva accord?
   A: Our people, who are going through a severe economic crisis,
cannot afford to build a center which costs at least $2 million.
   Q: But the Jews, for example the American ones, couldn't they
help?
   A: Yes, I think so. But first there is a need to re-establish a
bit of calm.
   Q: In order to re-establish this calm, wouldn't you like to meet
with the chief rabbi of Warsaw who, because of your talk in
Czestochowa, has not attended the meeting for peace among religious
leaders?
   A: Oh, I am still his friend...
   Q: He says you are not.
   A: How is that? Then he has changed (his mind)! With him we must
face all the diffcult issues which have been neglected so far.

   An outlawed Protestant group
claimed its gunmen killed an IRA member in a Roman Catholic
neighborhood Saturday, and police said soldiers killed one of the
attackers and captured the other.
   Relatives of the slain man, identified as Patrick McKenna, denied
claims he belonged to the Irish Republican Army.
   McKenna ran a grocery store, according to Sinn Fein, the legal
political wing of the IRA.
   The Ulster Volunteer force claimed responsibility for the slaying
in a message to a radio station in the British province. It said it
killed McKenna because he was a member of the IRA, a largely Roman
Catholic guerrilla organization that wants to oust the British and
unite Ireland under a socialist government. Loyalists _ generally
Protestants _ support British rule.
   The IRA has taken its fight to continental Europe and struck
against British troops there late Friday.
   IRA gunmen drove up to a British military housing complex in the
West German village of Gremmendorf, asked two soldiers for
directions and then opened fire on them, wounding both, police said
Saturday.
   One soldier was in critical condition and the other was seriously
wounded, said police in nearby Muenster, 110 miles north of Bonn.
   The IRA claimed reponsibility for the attack, the fourth on a
British military facility in West Germany since June.
   In the Belfast slaying, police said two gunmen rode into the
Ardoyne area on a motorcycle at midmorning.
   One man dismounted, shoved shoppers and children aside, and shot
the man, witnesses said.
   ``One of them got off the bike and shot him in the back. He tried
to run away but fell and the man kept on shooting at him,''
according to a woman who said she saw the shooting and spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``The other man on the bike also started
shooting at him.''
   The gunmen were making their getaway when they encountered an
army patrol that killed one of the assailants. The other gunman
surrendered after being wounded, police said. He was hospitalized
with undisclosed injuries.
   The loyalists identified the gunman killed fleeing the scene as
Brian Robinson. They did not identify the captured gunman.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the
gunmen were believed to have encountered soldiers working under
cover in an unmarked car.
   Two handguns were recovered, police said.
   Forty-five people have been killed in sectarian violence this
year in Northern Ireland. More than 2,700 people have died in two
decades of strife in the British province.

<HEAD>Federal Officials Seize Lebanese Jet, Detain Passengers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials Saturday seized a small
Lebanese jet that landed without permission at an airport and
questioned three passengers who they feared could be terrorists.
   An investigation showed three were not terrorists but aliens who
failed to check in with immigration officials, said Henry Brattlie,
deputy director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
office in Philadelphia. He said they showed ``blatant disregard of
the country's laws.''
   ``We had no knowledge when they came in whether they were
terrorists or fine, upstanding citizens,'' Brattlie said.
   Brattlie said the 20-passenger Gulf Stream G-3 jet, with two
pilots and at least six others on board, left London and landed at
Harrisburg International Airport last Sunday after disregarding
orders to travel to Philadelphia for an immigration inspection.
   He said the $13 million jet was seized and three passengers were
detained at 1:30 a.m. Saturday, after the jet returned to Harrisburg
from Burbank, Calif. The other passengers on board when the plane
first stopped at Harrisburg were not on board when it returned and
apparently left the country, Brattlie said.
   U.S. Attorney James West said the three detainees were released
later Saturday while prosecutors and Immigration officials decide
whether to press charges.
   ``We expect to file a (criminal) complaint in the near future,''
Brattlie said.
   Under federal law, any alien who enters the country without
checking in with immigration officials can be jailed for up to five
years if convicted. Anyone trying to bring an alien into the country
without permission can be fined $1,000 and sentenced to one year in
jail.
   The plane is owned by a Lebanese corporation co-owned by its two
pilots, and was leased to passengers Watche Manoukian, 44, his wife,
Tamar, 28, and his brother Varoujean, 38, Brattlie said. He did not
identify the corporation.
   The Manoukians were the three detained.
   Brattlie said Tamar Manoukian left the plane during its first
Harrisburg stop to visit a sick relative. The others flew to Burbank
because the pilots wanted to look at another plane, officials said.
   It was not clear what happened to the co-pilots. Brattlie had
said he would give details of the case at a news conference Saturday
afternoon, but it was canceled.
   The plane's occupants also face $1,000 administrative fines for
ignoring warnings not to land in Harrisburg.

   Polish Cardinal Josef Glemp said in an interview
published Saturday that an agreement to move a convent away from
Auschwitz should be renegotiated because the cardinals who signed it
didn't understand the issue.
   Glemp, the Roman Catholic prelate of Poland, said that moving the
Carmelite convent would be a ``scandal'' and ``offensive'' because
the nuns who live there are entitled to pray for Christians who died
at the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp.
   He criticized fellow Polish Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, saying
he acted too hastily and ignored Polish public opinion when he and
others signed a 1987 international accord to move the convent.
   Macharski, speaking Saturday at Birkenau near Auschwitz, urged an
end to ``hostility and hatred of Judaism.''
   Macharski addressed several thousand people who marched about a
half mile along the railroad tracks from Birkenau to the former of
the Auschwitz giant crematories. The procession was part of a World
Day of Prayer for Peace organized by the church to mark the
anniversary of the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany.
   In Chicago, several Jewish leader rejected invitations to attend
an interfaith service planned for Glemp's visit to Chicago scheduled
for Sept. 21-25.
   Rabbi Shlomo Levine, president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis,
said, ``I cannot in good conscience be part of an event honoring
him.''
   Rabbi Herman Schaalman, a former president of the board, and
Barry Morrison, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, said they would not attend the Sept. 25 service and
reception.
   Glemp's impromptu interview, given to Italian reporters in Poland
on Friday, appeared in several Italian newspapers.
   The reports contained the primate's first published remarks on
the matter since he stirred controversy last month by saying Polish
anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews would abandon their
anti-Polish sentiments.
   He also offended many Jews by suggesting Jews helped spread
communism, and by saying some Jews collaborated with Nazis during
World War II or as businessmen neglected and detested Poles.
   In the remarks published Saturday, Glemp said the Auschwitz
controversy could be settled. He was quoted as saying, ``Oh, we will
resolve it ... with patience. One needs to reflect a bit. There are
some Jewish circles who have let themselves be carried away by
nerves.''
   Jewish groups say the convent and its Christian religious symbols
offend the memory of the 2.5 million Jews who died there. Several
Jewish protesters recently entered to convent grounds to demand that
the convent be moved.
   Glemp spoke to reporters from Rome's La Repubblica and Il
Messaggero newspapers, Milan's Il Giornale, and the Catholic daily
Avvenire during a reception in Warsaw. Glemp was among the religious
leaders participating in joint prayers for peace on the 50th
anniversary of the start of World War II.
   Friday's ceremony was boycotted by Poland's rabbi, Menachem
Joszowicz, because of the presence of the Carmelite convent a few
feet from the fence surrounding the death camp.
   In an accord signed in Geneva in 1987 by Catholic and Jewish
leaders, the nuns were supposed to have moved by Feb. 22 to an
interfaith prayer center to be built several thousand yards away.
But the deadline passed without anything happening, and the center
has yet to be built.
   On Aug. 19, Macharski _ Polish-born Pope John Paul II's successor
as archbishop of Krakow _ said he was suspending the accord because
of ``aggressive'' demands and protests by Jewish activists at the
convent.
   When a reporter said the accord was signed by top church
officials, Glemp responded: ``No, by Cardinal Macharski and a group
of men who are not competent (in the matter),'' La Repubblica said.
   In addition to Macharski, French cardinals Jean-Marie Lustiger
and Albert Decourtray and Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels signed
the 1987 agreement.
   ``I want this accord to be renegotiated,'' Glemp was quoted as
saying. ``It has to be done by competent people and not by just any
cardinal who doesn't understand the things. ...''
   ``It's a scandal to expel the nuns from the convent,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``What do we have to do? Put them in tents? Who do
the nuns offend by praying next to the wall of the concentration
camp?''
   ``Our people don't understand. The Jews should understand that
devoting oneself to a life of prayer near the place where Christians
were martyred doesn't offend their feelings.''
   Asked if the ecumenical center would ever be built, he said there
was no money for it right now because of the nation's economic
crisis.
   When asked if Jews, including Americans, could help pay for it,
he said, ``Yes, I think so. But first there is a need to
re-establish a bit of calm.''
   Theo Klein, former president of the Representative Council of
Jewish Institutions of France and one of the signatories of the 1987
agreement, said in an interview on Radio Monte-Carlo:
   ``If he wants to renegotiate the accord, he will have to
renegotiate with himself. I don't see how any Jewish authority would
accept to renegotiate this accord with Monsignor Glemp.''

   More than 250 people were met by curses and
epithets as they marched through a white neighborhood Saturday to
protest the release of five alleged members of a white gang accused
of killing a black teen.
   As they did last weekend, residents taunted the marchers during
their 12-block route through the Brooklyn neighborhood of
Bensonhurst. But police officers outnumbered demonstrators,
preventing any physical confrontations.
   There were no arrests, said police spokesman Sgt. Peter Berry.
   The demonstration was sparked by the Aug. 23 shooting death of
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins during an attack by a white gang in
Bensonhurst.
   Most of the residents' taunts were directed at the Rev. Al
Sharpton, the controversial black activist who organized the march.
In response, the marchers chanted ``Yusuf, Yusuf'' and ``No justice,
no peace!''
   Hawkins was killed in Bensonhurst when he and three friends were
confronted by about 30 whites carrying baseball bats and golf clubs
who were looking for black friends of a white neighborhood girl,
police said.
   Hawkins, who didn't know the girl and was in Bensonhurst to look
at a used car, was shot twice in the chest. Seven people have been
arrested, including the alleged gunman, Joseph Fama.
   The slaying prompted demonstrations last weekend, and a march
with 7,500 people on Thursday led to a brawl near the Brooklyn
Bridge which left 44 police officers injured.
   The marchers Saturday did not go through an Italian festival
being held in the neighborhood, as Sharpton had said they would;
instead, they marched about two blocks away.
   ``We have no problem at all in crashing their party because they
certainly crashed this family,'' Sharpton had said.
   Marchers last weekend were met with racial slurs and chants of
``Go home,'' while some residents taunted black protesters by
holding watermelons aloft.
   ``I don't think Bensonhurst will ever change, being the people
here are ignorant,'' said Tina Treglio, a resident who watched
Saturday's march. ``People teach their kids to be prejudiced. ...
They're not talking about that the killing was senseless.''
   Fama was ordered held without bail Friday on charges of murder,
felony assault, riot, weapons possession, civil rights violations,
harassment and menacing. The other suspects have been released on
bail of $75,000 to $100,000.

<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who said she shot her sleeping
husband out of fear for her life was acquitted of murder charges by
a jury.
   Janice Mehaffy, 43, had been charged with murder in the Feb. 2
shotgun slaying of her husband, Carl, 45, in their home.
   The innocent verdict Friday night was greeted with a loud shriek
by more than 40 of the woman's friends at Des Moines County District
Court in southeastern Iowa.
   Her attorneys argued that Ms. Mehaffy killed her husband in
self-defense. Prosecutors said she was not in imminent danger when
she pulled the trigger at 6:20 a.m.
   Ms. Mehaffy said she felt calm in the moments right before the
verdict.
   ``I don't know if that's good or bad to say, but I did. I felt
real good. I knew I was innocent. I knew I was going to be alive,''
she said.
   During the trial, defense attorneys argued that Ms. Mehaffy had
developed battered woman's syndrome. During two days of emotional
testimony, Ms. Mehaffy described bouts of abuse at the hands of her
husband during their 22-year marriage.
   Dr. Lenore Walker, a clinical psychologist who has researched the
syndrome and written books on the subject, testified for the
defense. She said that although Mehaffy was asleep, Ms. Mehaffy
still perceived him as a danger and could see no other viable
alternatives.
   Defense lawyers said Mehaffy had planned to kill his wife in the
early morning hours of Feb. 2 if she didn't make a commitment to
come home after separating from him Jan. 14.
   Although Ms. Mehaffy had been living in an apartment with her
daughter, she and her husband spent the night of the shooting at
home together after the daughter suffered injuries in an automobile
accident.

<HEAD>Politburo Member Attacks Baltic Nationalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev accused Baltic
nationalists Saturday of circulating rumors of discord in the
Kremlin leadership in order to weaken it.
   Ligachev spoke in a 15-minute TV interview broadcast a week after
the Communist Party Central Committee warned Baltic residents that
nationalists were leading them into an abyss.
   He said that while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev patiently
pushes his reforms, people seeking to increase their personal power
are manipulating the country's problems and unfairly attacking the
foundations of Soviet society.
   ``The situation demands some measures be taken but not,
certainly, measures of repression or dictatorship, but first of all
political ones,'' said Ligachev.
   The political situation in the Soviet Union has become more
tense, he said, criticizing party members who are taking part in
strikes and nationalist movements.
   ``All sorts of nationalists and separatists are working very
actively with the purpose of separating the leadership, to weaken
the leadership,'' said Ligachev. ``There are a lot of rumors and
gossip circulating, and all this is not done innocently.''
   As an example, he cited doubts about the source of last week's
tough Central Committee statement.
   Leaders of the grass-roots People's Front movements of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania, which are leading the drive for local
sovereignty, have said they think the Central Committee statement
was drafted by a faction of the 251-member body while President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev was on vacation.
   Saturday's statement from Ligachev, widely considered a
conservative force, appeared to be a high-level effort to show party
unity on the matter. Some Baltic activists think he sides with
officials wanting to clamp down on the drive for sovereignty.
   Ligachev defended the Central Committee statement as ``the very
one to create the most favorable conditions for restructuring, and
to speed up its processes.''
   Officials have reported that Gorbachev called Lithuanian
Communist Party officials to warn them the republic had gone too far
in a government commission report saying Lithuania's annexation by
the Soviet Union in 1940 was an ``international crime.''
   Soviet spokesmen also have said Gorbachev took part in drafting
the statement.

<HEAD>Troops Kill Three Palestinians on West Bank</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Israeli soldier killed in border
clash, army statement blaming Palestinian group for Nablus attacks; no

   Israeli troops killed two Palestinians in the
West Bank Saturday, and Arab reports said the soldiers then fatally
shot a 14-year-old Arab girl during protests touched off by the
earlier deaths.
   Also Saturday, a Palestinian guerrilla crossed the border from
Jordan, killed an Israeli soldier and wounded two others before he
was killed by soldiers near an Israeli communal farm, the army said.
   The army said the first two Palestinians killed in the West Bank
city of Nablus were ``terrorists,'' a term usually used to describe
armed attackers. An army spokeswoman said they were part of a group
planning an attack and the army had arrested three others.
   Arab reports, witnesses and said the two were killed in a
pre-dawn shootout between Israeli soldiers and an armed Arab group.
It was only the second shootout reported in the 20-month-old
Palestinian protest of Israeli occupation.
   Israel television showed a villa in Nablus that it said served as
a hideout for the gang. Troops raided the villa and fatally shot two
of the men hiding inside as they tried to escape through a window,
the report said.
   The army issued a statement late Saturday blaming the armed
Palestinian group for a chain of attacks and killings of
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israeli occupation
authorities.
   One of the Palestinians killed, 19-year-old Amar Muhamed Khanis
Kalbune, was wanted for killing an Israeli reservist in February by
dropping a concrete block on his head in a Nablus marketplace, the
army said.
   The other Palestinian killed in the clash, 24-year-old Iman
Shafik Muhammed Jamus, was wanted for killings and attacks on
suspected collaborators around Nablus, the statement said.
   The army said it seized weapons Saturday, and Armed Forces radio
said they included grenades, ammunition, swords and axes.
   The army's statement said the three arrested group members are
all suspected in attacks on purported collaborators.
   Protests erupted in Nablus after the shootings, Arab reports
said. Muna Tamaam, 14, was fatally shot by soldiers while she
participated in a student demonstration, the Arab reports said.
   The army spokeswoman said she was checking on the report.
   In addition, at least 13 Arabs were wounded during the protests,
Arab reports said.
   The army imposed a curfew and declared Nablus a closed military
zone. The city has been a hub of unrest during the uprising.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip on Saturday, a man identified as Abdul
Rahman Abu Shaluf was found dead, Arab reports said.
   Some Arab reports said he was a smuggler and drug dealer, and
others said he was also suspected of collaborating with Israel. They
said he was shot with a pistol by masked Palestinians in the Rafah
marketplace on Saturday.
   Saturday's deaths brought to 557 the number of Palestinians
killed by troops or Jewish settlers during the uprising. In
addition, 104 Arabs, mostly suspected collaborators, have been
killed by fellow Arabs.
   Thirty-nine Israelis also have been killed.
   Soldiers shot and wounded at seven others in clashes in the Gaza
Strip on Saturday, including a 9-year-old boy.
   A Palestinian wounded last week in unclear circumtances died
Saturday in east Jerusalem's Mokassed hospital.
   The man was wounded in the head, and Arab reports said he was
injured by a settler who stoned him on the Jerusalem-Hebron road.
   The army said it was investigating.
   Early Saturday, a patrol clashed with a Palestinian who had
infiltrated from Jordan, and the guerrilla and an Israeli trooper
were killed, the army said. Two others were wounded, the army said.
   The guerrilla was wearing civilian clothes and had a pistol and a
Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifle, the army said. Chief of Staff Gen.
Dan Shomron said the gunman was a member of a Palestine Liberation
Organization faction.
   The clash took place near Kibbutz Kefar Ruppin, a communal farm
on the Jordanian border 48 miles northeast of Jerusalem.

   The South sweltered and the Northwest cooled off Saturday, while
the Midwest and New England enjoyed mostly sunny skies and mild
temperatures.
   A strong high pressure system centered over northwest Illinois
was responsible for the mild weather from the Midwest into New
England.
   Cooler weather spread across the Northwest behind a cold front
extending across the northern Rockies.
   Summer temperatures reigned across the deep South where they
climbed into the 90s from much of Texas across the central Gulf
Coast states to the southern Atlantic coast.
   A record high of 95 degrees for the date was set in Apalachicola,
Fla.
   A band of showers and a few thunderstorms extended from central
and south-central Oklahoma into central Arkansas. More than 3{
inches of rain soaked McAlester, Okla., in 24 hours.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over parts of southern
and west-central Florida and the southern Rockies. Another band of
showers accompanied a cold front eastward across central Montana.
Thunderstorms were beginning to develop over parts of the central
Gulf Coast states.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at Mullan, Idaho, to 101 degrees at Beeville, Texas.
   The nation's low was 29 degrees at Gunnison, Colo., and Truckee,
Calif.
   Sunday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across
much of Montana and scattered elsewhere across the northern Plains;
thunderstorms from the central Gulf Coast region through Florida,
southern Georgia and the eastern Carolinas; and widely scattered
thunderstorms from southeast Arizona across New Mexico and Oklahoma
into the lower Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 80s or low 90s for
most of the nation; the upper 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast,
from the northern Plateau through the northern high Plains, and from
North Dakota across the Great Lakes to the northern half of the
Atlantic Coast; and the upper 90s to around 100 degrees across much
of Texas and the desert Southwest.

   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, who has
angered Jews by refusing to remove a convent from beside the
Auschwitz death camp, on Saturday urged an end to ``hostility and
hatred of Judaism.''
   Macharski, Roman Catholic archbishop of Krakow, addressed several
thousand people representing various religions who marched more than
a half mile from Birkenau along the railroad tracks used by the
Nazis to the former site of the camp's giant crematories, according
to the state PAP news agency.
   The procession was part of a World Day of Prayer for Peace
organized by the church to mark the anniversary of the Sept. 1,
1939, invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany.
   Marcharski spoke at a service at the international memorial to
the 4 million people put to death at the sprawling
Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex located in and around
the southern Polish city of Oswiecim. Among the victims were an
estimated 2.5 million Jews.
   ``Here the Nazi hatred killed millions of men, women and
children: Jews destined for the final extermination which is today
called `Holocaust' and `Shoah;' Gypsies destined for extermination;
despised Slavs, especially Russians and Poles, and many other sons
and daughters of nations mentioned on the tablets at which we are
standing,'' Macharski said.
   PAP also quoted him as saying, ``In this terrible place, the
commitment against the evil that reigned here must be strengthened.
No! To hostility and hatred towards Judaism. No! To any contempt and
racial hatred. No! To the desire to rule and conquer, to contempt
for and struggle against religion.''
   Macharski, whose archdiocese includes Oswiecim, has been a
central figure in the controversy over the convent of 14 Carmelite
nuns in a building used by the Nazis as a storehouse just outside
the fence of the Auschwitz camp.
   Jews and some other religious leaders have said it is offensive
to have Christian symbols, including a tall wooden cross, at a place
that was the site of death for millions of people massacred solely
for being Jews.
   Poland's one rabbi refused to take part in Day of Prayer for
Peace and only four Jews were listed as participating.
   Macharski agreed in an accord in 1987 to move the convent to an
interfaith prayer center farther from the camp by Feb. 22, 1989. But
he announced Aug. 10 that he was suspending the promise because of
``aggressive'' protests staged at the convent by some Jewish groups
after the deadline passed.
   People in Oswiecim and elsewhere in predominantly Catholic Poland
generally support the convent and its nuns, saying they harm no one
when they pray for the camp's victims, thousands of whom were not
Jewish.
   Oswiecim townspeople also distinguish between the Auschwitz camp,
where many Polish political prisoners were slain, and the huge
Birkenau camp a mile away, designed for the mass murder of Jews
brought by train from throughout Europe.

   For the millions of people who were born
after World War II, the solemn ceremonies marking the 50th
anniversary of the German invasion of this nation amounted to a
history lesson.
   For the Poles who lived through the carnage, the memorials
marking the Sept. 1, 1939, outbreak of the war have brought back a
flood of memories.
   ``I survived,'' said Alexandra Sikorska, who served as a courier
for the Polish resistance.
   She said she cried watching televised memorial ceremonies from
Westerplatte, the Baltic peninsula in Gdansk where a German
battleship fired the first salvos of the war at a small Polish
garrison.
   ``Young people were taking a pledge, and I remembered I was young
too then. All my life seems strange because my young days were at
that time,'' she said.
   Mrs. Sikorska, 70, said when the war began she built barricades
against Nazi tanks with paving stones. Then, she carried messages
for the resistance.
   ``I was always thinking that I would be taking part in everything
until the very end,'' she said, her medal of valor dangling from her
collar as she stood in Warsaw's Castle Square during a peace
ceremony marking Friday's anniversary.
   A bronze memorial filling half a city block is being completed to
honor the valiant but doomed stand against the Germans during the
Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Two hundred thousand people in the city
died in the fighting, and the reprisal massacres that followed.
   Nationwide, 6 million Poles died in the war, including 3 million
Jews, and much of Poland was reduced to rubble.
   Proudly wearing combat medals at the ceremony were two men who
started the war as Poles and ended it as citizens of territory
annexed by the Soviet Union.
   ``In September 1939, my friend and I were the first to fight the
Germans. We had active duty that day,'' said Jozef Zamojdzin, still
speaking his native Polish.
   They fought ``not to allow the enemy to tread on Polish soil,''
said his friend, Stefan Sidoromek, ``But we had to face enormous
violence and we were not able to overcome it.''
   They eventually joined the Polish army that the Soviets allowed
to be reformed on their territory after the Germans attacked their
former ally.
   Both men showed honors from the battle of Monte Cassino, one of
the Polish army's many heroic efforts through Africa and Italy.
   ``A soldier is a soldier in order to defend the homeland, and to
be victorious,'' Zamojdzin said.

<HEAD>Magazines Say West Berlin Politician Had Contacts with East German
Spies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two magazines said Saturday that a member of the
West German Parliament who held security posts in West Berlin had
contacts for years with East German intelligence agents.
   The Hamburg-based Der Spiegel and Stern magazines claimed
Heinrich Lummer had an ``intimate relationship with a woman known to
be an East German spy'' and also had frequent contacts with other
East German agents in the 1970s and 1980s.
   Lummer is a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union Party and represents West Berlin in the federal
Parliament in Bonn.
   West Berlin officials would neither confirm nor deny the reports.
No one answered the telephone at Lummer's residence in West Berlin.
   The magazines said Lummer, who once acted as chief of the West
Berlin Constitutional Protection Office, had not informed security
officials of the full extent of his contacts with people in
communist East Berlin.
   Der Spiegel and Stern said the West Berlin Constitutional
Protection Office, responsible for counterintelligence efforts in
the city, had since given federal prosecutors a dossier on Lummer's
activities.
   According to both magazines East German agents sought to
blackmail Lummer into further contacts with the use of
``compromising photographs.''
   The magazines said it is not known what Lummer may have told the
East German agents.
   Der Spiegel said Lummer first told West Berlin security officials
about his contacts in 1975, years after they began.
   It said Lummer told security officials ``that he went along with
the game to find out what kind of information the agents wanted from
him.''
   Both Der Spiegel and Stern reported that Lummer told officials he
had regularly informed a friend in West Germany's intelligence

   The magazines quoted a spokesman for the West German intelligence
service as saying Lummer initially informed the service about the
contacts but denied that the agency had been briefed on a regular
basis.

   A woman who survived two weeks adrift in an
open raft said Saturday she now realizes ``life can be taken away at
any time,'' and she'll rearrange her life for more leisure to
indulge her love of the outdoors.
   Janet Culver, 48, who spent the last month recovering from
dehydration, exposure and undernourishment in a hospital in
Hamilton, Bermuda, arrived Saturday in New York aboard the Royal
Viking Star cruise ship.
   Six weeks ago, she and Nicholas Abbott, whom she was considering
marrying, left Bermuda in a 37-foot sailboat bound for Greenport,
N.Y. The sailboat sank in the Atlantic and Abbott, 50, was lost at
sea.
   ``It has made me rearrange my priorities,'' Ms. Culver said in a
telephone interview shortly after her return home to Passaic. ``I'm
going to spend more time doing the things I want to do in life
instead of putting them on a back burner because I realize life can
be taken away at any time.''
   Ms. Culver said she planned to spend the next few weeks resting
at her mother's home on Long Island in New York and healing from
skin grafts to remove ulcers caused by friction from the raft.
   She will also mull over several movie and book offers she's
received to recount her ordeal.
   Ms. Culver, said she would return to work as a legal secretary at
a law firm as soon as she is well.
   But she is considering changing careers and rescheduling her life
so she can spend six months of the year doing volunteer work,
enjoying nature, cycling, and pursuing her favorite hobby _ trout
fishing.
   ``The time I'`m going to be taking off for myself will be really
to enjoy nature and the outdoors,'' she said.
   During her two weeks in the raft, Ms. Culver never doubted she
would return home, she said. She attributes her survival to her good
eating habits and physical fitness before leaving for the trip.
   She said Abbott became covered with sores, could not sleep and
began seeing double, she said. By the seventh day in the raft, he
had become depressed and lost hope of being rescued.
   On the tenth day, he took off his clothes and told her he was
going for a swim and might not come back.
   ``He was in a great deal of pain,'' she said. ``He said life was
not worth living in that state.''
   Abbott, an avid sailor, invited Ms. Culver on the trip to see if
they were compatible enough to marry. It was her first real sailing
experience.
   Initially, he became impatient with her when she failed to follow
orders quickly enough, she said. He also was irritated when she
became seasick.
   ``He gained more respect for me on the raft ... seeing I wasn't
afraid,'' she said. ``He said I was the right person to be with in
this situation.''
   Their sailboat, the Anaulis, sank on July 16 when a line fell
overboard and became entangled in the sailboat's propeller. The
couple started the engine, thinking it was in neutral, but it
lurched into gear and the force ripped a hole in the stern, she said.
   The couple survived the first week on crackers, cooked fish, cold
cuts, nuts, water and soft drinks they had brought with them in the
lifeboat.
   When their supplies ran out, Abbott caught fish with a home-made
harpoon and they collected rain water. When it didn't rain for four
days, they survived by drinking their urine.
   Ms. Culver was rescued July 30, about 450 miles southeast of New
York, by a Rhode Island couple and a group of students tagging
turtles and sharks from their 54-foot sailboat, Jeronimo.
   Ms. Culver said she does not fear going sailing again.
   ``The experience was not a frightening experience,'' she said.
``It was just a matter of endurance.''

   LACONIA, N.H. (AP) _ Two small planes in a convoy of eight
crashed within minutes and miles of each other as they were
returning from a dinner outing, authorities said Saturday. Four
people died in one crash and three were injured in the other.
   Both planes went down in bad weather Friday night, but the fatal
crash was not discovered until Saturday morning, police said.
   Survivors of the other crash said all eight planes had flown
about 60 miles from Newburyport, Mass., to Laconia, where the
travelers had dinner, said state Aeronautics Director Harold Buker.
   The travelers returned to the airport in Laconia, 25 miles north
of Concord, at about 9 p.m. Bad weather prompted two of the pilots
to stay in Laconia but the other six took off.
   One plane crashed into a hill in Sanbornton, about five miles
southwest of Laconia. Three people from Massachusetts on board
suffered sprains, cuts and other minor injuries.
   The second plane crashed in woods in Northfield, about 10 miles
south of Laconia, but authorities busy with the Sanbornton crash did
not discover it immediately, Buker said.
   ``I think they both happened within minutes of each other,'' he
said.
   A satellite passing overhead after rescuers finished work at the
Sanbornton site picked up an emergency signal from the downed Cessna
172 in Northfield.
   Killed in the crash were Harry Avakian, 63, and his wife,
Beatrice Avakian, 62, of Newburyport, Mass., and Bruce Magoon, 60,
and his wife, Alice Magoon, 60, of Manchester, Mass., said
Northfield police dispatcher Diane Heath.
   Of the other four planes that left Laconia, two arrived at
Newburyport and two made it to Lawrence, Mass., about 15 miles to
the southwest.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation
Safety Board were investigating both accidents.

<HEAD>Police: No. 2 Drug Baron Owns More Companies Than He Knows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The reputed No. 2 man in the Medellin
drug cartel owns at least 408 companies including Colombia's top
soccer team _ so many he probably doesn't know exactly what he has,
police said Saturday.
   They disclosed documents to journalists to demonstrate the drug
traffickers' far-reaching involvement in Colombia's economy.
   Police officials told reporters that Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
reputed No. 2 in the cartel, owns at least 408 companies
encompassing a variety of businesses from livestock and cars to the
top soccer team the Millonarios, or Millionaires.
   ``This guy probably didn't know exactly what he had. And he's
just one drug lord,'' an astonished police colonel said of Rodriguez
Gacha, who is in hiding.
   Pablo Escobar, reputed chief of the Medellin cartel, ``is
believed to own more, much more,'' the colonel said on condition of
anonymity.
   Escobar is considered the world's richest criminal, he said.
   News reports say Colombian drug lords' properties in the country
are worth as much as $5.5 billion.
   Thousands of Colombians make their living, directly or
indirectly, out of the Medellin organization, whose monthly payroll
a police investigator estimated at $1.5 million.
   It is not immediately clear how the enterprises and Colombia's
economy will be affected by the government's war on the drug lords.
   Police on Aug. 25 seized Rodriguez Gacha's corporate office in
downtown Bogota _ the seventh floor of an impressive 26-story
building with facilities including a heliport.
   A shining bronze plaque identifies Coordinadora Empresarial
Ltda., translated roughly as Business Holdings Ltd., at the floor
entrance.
   The company led Rodriguez Gacha's octopus-like enterprises. It
ran at least 34 subsidiaries which, in turn, dictated to at least 12
subsidiaries of their own. They permeated almost every sector of the
Colombian economy and were based in at least 13 major cities, police
officials said.
   ``The Coordinadora dealt with mountains of money. I have gone
through a bank savings account to which 315 million pesos (about
$800,000) was deposited in just two weeks,'' the police official
said. He would not disclose the account holder or bank's name.
   The conglomerate's financial ability was reflected in
transactions involving soccer players of the Millonarios Club, some
now playing on the national team competing for a slot in the 1990
World Soccer Cup tournament in Italy.
   Millonarios has been national champion for two years.
   Several pages fixed on one of the office walls showed the
bookkeeping cost of players through December 1987: what it cost to
purchase them from other clubs and what their likely value would be
in a sale to another club.
   Arnoldo Iguaran Zuuniga, a Colombian star playing for the
national team, was sold to Millonarios in 1983 for $38,000. The
price tag for the player was $120,000 in 1987.
   Others, like Millonarios star Eduardo Pimentel, had a nominal
bookkeeping cost of a quarter of a cent and a very high sale price
of $125,000.
   Colombian sports writers said actual sale prices are much higher.
   Among books displayed in executive offices of Coordinadora was a
recent Colombian bestseller called ``The Game's Bosses,'' with the
subtitle ``Soccer Players, Slaves or Merchandise?''
   Police authorities said the documents do not imply players are
involved in any cocaine business but that the club definitely was
financed by Rodriguez Gacha.
   The conglomerate owned more than 20 ranches including
``Chihuahua,'' which was seized by the army two weeks ago. The ranch
40 miles from Bogota was believed to be Rodriguez Gacha's
headquarters.
   Rodriguez Gacha, also known by his nickame El Mexicano because of
his passion for the Mexican culture, is one of the 12 alleged drug
traffickers wanted by the United States.
   His 18-year-old son, Freddy Rodriguez, was arrested when the army
seized the ranch. He is not wanted in the United States, but police
believe his father ``will do everything'' to rescue him.

   A 19-year-old man was struck and killed by two
cars while ``mooning'' passing vehicles on a highway Saturday,
authorities said.
   A witness reported the man was standing in a southbound lane of
the Pacific Coast Highway at about 1 a.m. ``His pants were down and
he was bent over with his back to the vehicle'' when he was struck
by a car traveling about 45 mph, police Officer Roger Peck quoted
the witness as saying.
   The man was knocked down and a second car ran over his body, Peck
said.
   Killed was Jesus Lopez of Los Angeles, said Peck.
   No one else was injured and no arrests were made, he said.

   Young women tossed panties and bras on stage
and crowds toppled barriers, injuring dozens of spectators, during a
pop concert by soap opera heartthrob Michael Damian, authorities
said.
   There were no serious injuries and no arrests in the incident
Friday night at the Dubuque County Fairgrounds, the Dubuque
sheriff's office said.
   Ambulance crews examined or treated about 40 people at the scene
for minor injuries and heat-related problems, and another 24 people
were treated at a hospital and released, police said.
   The sheriff's office said no special security arrangements had
been made for the event featuring Damian, a star of the TV soap
opera ``The Young and the Restless'' and a pop singer.
   The crowd of 3,500 to 4,000 was unexpectedly large, and made up
mostly of teen-age girls and young women, police said.
   Some people were pushed against crowd-control barriers or stepped
on when the crowd surged toward the stage. Sheriff's officers and
state troopers helped restore order.
   ``They were throwing panties and bras up on the stage,'' said a
police dispatcher, who would not give her name.

<HEAD>Anniversary Celebration Ends with Some Tension</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi ended a grand
celebration of his 20 years in power with dancing and sporting
events that lasted into the early hours Saturday.
   There were air shows and a military parade Friday to mark the
aniversary of the Sept. 1, 1969, coup that overthrew pro-Western
King Idris.
   Gadhafi addressed a special session of the General People's
Congress Friday before reviewing the evening parade in Tripoli's
central Green Square.
   In his speech Gadhafi praised ``the people of Panama in
confronting American imperialism'' and said of Israel, ``The Zionist
entity ... must be removed ... Palestine is for Palestinians.''
   He also pledged support for revolutionary movements in Central
America, South Africa and countries around the world.
   The celebrations were attended by at least 19 heads of state.
Western diplomats said their presence reflected Gadhafi's efforts to
end years of international isolation due to his alleged support of
terrorism and Libya's conflicts with its neighbors.
   But the diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all
did not go smoothly. They suggested that Moroccan King Hassan II
snubbed the Libyan leader and noted a summit of five North African
countries that Gadhafi had hoped to host was not held.
   Hassan skipped the General People's Congress session that opened
the celebrations and then arrived at the nighttime parade 1{ hours
late. He left after 30 minutes, prompting an exodus by other heads
of state.
   But a Moroccan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the king had not snubbed Gadhafi but was too busy to attend all of
the anniversary events.
   Gadhafi had hoped to preside at a summit with Algeria, Tunisia,
Morocco and Mauritania to discuss forming an economic union. A
Western diplomat said a committee planning the summit suspended its
work because of disagreements over financial matters.
   In Chad, the government announced it will free some Libyan
prisoners as a goodwill gesture to mark Gadhafi's 20-year reign.
   A statement from President Hissene Habre's office in N'Djamena,
made public Friday night by the Chadian Embassy in Paris, did not
specify how many Libyans would be freed or when they would be sent
home.
   Chad is believed to hold about 2,000 Libyan soldiers captured
during years of fighting in northern Chad.
   Libya and Chad signed an agreement Thursday in Algeria to settle
their dispute over the Aouzou Strip, a 45,000-square mile border
region. The pact calls for the release of all prisoners of war held
by both sides.

<HEAD>Heavy Fighting Reported in Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan government soldiers and
U.S.-backed guerrillas are fighting a fierce battle for a rebel-held
town in the southeast of the African country, Portugal's LUSA news
agency reported Saturday.
   Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battle for Mavinga,
the news agency quoted unidentified Angolan sources as saying.
   Angolan government and rebel officials estimate hundreds of
people have died in the clashes, which follow the breakdown of a
June truce in the 14-year-old civil war.
   In a report from Luanda, the Angolan capital, LUSA said
government advance units have reached the outskirts of Mavinga after
more than a week of heavy fighting.
   The Angolan army lost three Soviet-built MiG-23 jet fighters and
a Gazelle helicopter, the report said.
   It said determined rebel resistance indicates Mavinga holds a
vital strategic position in the defense of the bush headquarters at
Jamba of the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
   However, the Luanda sources said government fighters managed to
cross three rivers regarded as natural barriers to the advance on
Mavinga and are threatening the town, Lusa reported.
   But the rebels' Voice of the Black Rooster radio station had
reported government troops Monday were retreating toward the town of
Cuito Cuanavale, 95 miles northwest of Mavinda.
   LUSA also reported bloody battles in northeastern Lunda Norte
province, where it said three rebel battalions besieged a single
government battalion in the diamond mining center of Cafunfo. It
said about 300 foreign workers, mostly Filipino miners, were
evacuated from Cafunfo.
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi
signed the truce at an African summit in Gbadolite, Zaire. But the
cease-fire collapsed a week later.
   Sources cited in the LUSA report said the rebels' use of
long-range artillery in the battle for Mavinda shows South Africa
continues to support them, despite pledging to halt aid under
U.S.-sponsored accords signed with Angola and Cuba.
   Under accords in December, South Africa agreed to grant
independence to Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia, and Cuba agreed
to a phased withdrawal of its 50,000 troops supporting the Angolan
government.
   The rebels have been fighting to share government since
Portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from Angola in 1975, leaving
rival groups to fight for power. The Marxist Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola won.

   Gustav Romero, a 24-year-old virtuoso
from San Diego, won the 1989 Clara Haskil Prize for young classical
pianists, organizers said Saturday.
   An international seven-member jury chose Romero after hearing 43
competitors from some 20 countries in the 10-day event. The prize is
worth $7,500.
   The jury gave honorable mention to Patricia Pagny of France and
Marietta Petkova of Bulgaria, who were also among six finalists
chosen for two tests with the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra.
   Romero was born in San Diego and studied at the Juilliard School
of Music. He has given recitals in Boston, New York and Los Angeles
and appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and Los
Angeles Philharmonic.
   The prize was founded in 1963 in memory of Clara Haskil, a
Romanian-born pianist who became famous in Paris and Vienna at the

<HEAD>Japanese Prime Minister Begins Boston Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiku Kaifu arrived
Saturday for a weekend visit in Boston, where he planned to meet
with academicians, visit the Museum of Fine Arts and toss out the
first pitch at a Red Sox game.
   Kaifu, on a weeklong tour of the United States, Canada and
Mexico, came straight from Washington, where he met Friday with
President Bush for talks on the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance and other
issues.
   The Prime Minister's trip, coming soon after he ascended to
Japan's top governmental post, is designed in part to lend
legitimacy to his new administration. But his Boston itinerary,
which was to squeeze in visits to Harvard University and the Plimoth
Plantation, where the pilgrims first settled, seemed to resemble
more that of a typical tourist.
   Kaifu, 58, was made prime minister last month after his
predecessors in Japan's ruling conservative party suffered a series
of political and sex scandals.
   Waving American and Japanese flags, about 400 people were on hand
when the Prime Minister arrived at Logan International Airport.
Approximately 300 of the spectators were students at the Japanese
Language School of Greater Boston.
   The principal of the school, Etsuo Takahashi, said he thought it
was important to give the Japanese Prime Minister an appropriate
reception.
   ``We wanted to prove that the Japanese and the United States are
in good and friendly relations. Not only Japanese but Americans are
here too,'' said Takahashi, 48, through an interpreter.
   Kaifu and his wife passed through a reception line at Logan
International Airport that included Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and his
wife Kitty, as well as Cathy Flynn, the Boston Mayor's wife. The
mayor is traveling in California.
   The group then shook hands with the crowd and departed in
limousines for the Four Seasons Hotel in Boston, where Dukakis and
Kaifu were to hold a private meeting.
   After the meeting, the Prime Minister planned to host a dinner
for the area's leading academicians. The presidents of Harvard
University, Boston University, The University of Massachusetts and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were invited, as well as
several scholars in East Asian studies.
   Kaifu, who served as Japan's educational minister twice, was
scheduled to visit MIT and Harvard on Sunday.
   The Prime Minister wanted to emphasize the top priority he gives
to the relationship between the United States and Japan in the
educational sphere, said Richard Winslow, an adviser at the Japanese
Consulate.
   After a quick tour of the Asiatic, Impressionistic and Copley
galleries at the Museum of Fine Arts, Kaifu will head for Fenway
Park to see the Red Sox play the Seattle Mariners.
   Kaifu, who began his trip Aug. 30 in San Francisco, is scheduled
to fly to Mexico City on Monday and go from there to Ottawa, Canada.

   A 16-month-old baby provided police with
the evidence _ a tiny handful of crack _ when two officers arrested
a man for drug possession, police said Saturday.
   James Hezzy, 29, of Wyandanch was arrested Friday night for
possession of a controlled substance, Suffolk County police said.
The child's mother, 28-year-old Millicent Angus of North Babylon,
was arrested for loitering and endangering the welfare of a child.
   According to police, the incident began when two officers spotted
Hezzy standing beside Ms. Angus' car at an intersection.
   As the officers approached the car, Hezzy allegedly dropped
several packages of crack into it, police said. When the policemen
arrived at the car, the baby reached up and showed them several
pieces of crack that had fallen inside, police said.
   The infant was released into the custody of his grandmother.

<TEXT>
   Experts and volunteers lovingly tending
what are believed to be the first beaked whales in captivity are
surprised the ailing young cetaceans remain alive more than a week
after being beached.
   ``I didn't expect them to live through the (first) night; I
didn't expect them to make it off the truck and into the pool,''
said Dr. Laurie Gage, veterinarian at Marine World-Africa USA.
   ``No one's ever seen these guys alive,'' she said. ``There are
whale experts coming in from all over because they've never seen one
alive.''
   But Gage, staff and volunteers at the animal park where the
whales were in stable but guarded condition Saturday tried to be
realistic about the mammals' poor chances for survival and a return
to their home at deep ocean depths.
   ``It's hard not to become attached; You look at their big brown
eyes and....,'' Gage said as she watched the pair swim slowly around
their shaded isolation tank.
   Alexander and Nicholas were found on San Francisco's Ocean Beach
Aug. 24 and taken to Marine World, about 35 miles northeast of San
Francisco. While scientists aren't sure of their species, they think
the two are less than a year old _ possibly only a few months old.
   Their rescue excited marine mammal experts because beaked whales
_ which live beyond the continental shelf and dive thousands of feet
for squid _ are almost never seen except as a rare skeleton or
carcass washed up on a beach.
   So little was known about beaked whales that the experts rushed
to the reference books, Gage said.
   Most stranded dolphins and whales are sick or hurt, and Nicholas
and Alexander are battling serious health problems, Gage said.
   Although they have improved somewhat since their rescue, both
still have low white blood cell counts, indicating a bacterial
infection or virus-caused immune system disorder. They have been
treated with antibiotics, vitamins and steroids and force fed a
``fish shake'' and liquids by tubes inserted into their tail flukes.
   In addition, Alexander developed a mild cast of pneumonia
Saturday, said Cecilia Pelshakov, a Marine World spokeswoman.
   Nicholas, the larger of the pair at 10 feet, also has an
undetermined liver problem and an accumulation of gas between the
skin and muscles on his left side _ possibly caused by a blow.
   Two cardiologists from a local hospital have inserted three small
tubes, held in place with a mesh ``tank top,'' to let the gas escape.
   ``He seems a little more active and more comfortable,'' Gage
said, adding that it could take several days for the gas to be
eliminated, allowing Nicholas to dive.
   Marine World's staff was guardedly optimistic Friday because the
9-foot Alexander, in better shape and more stable from the start,
ate three pounds of herring with the help of his handlers.
   The park's staff of 16, with the help of volunteers from the
California Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, has been watching the
whales around the clock. Gage and the other handlers are delighted
the sleek gray creatures, which probably never saw people before,
are gentle and accepting of humans.
   ``What's so remarkable to us is they're showing such an interest
in people,'' said Marine World spokeswoman Mary O'Herron. ``They
follow the trainers around'' and suck on their thumbs, she added.
   Marine mammal experts from the California Academy of Sciences in
San Francisco, the University of California at Santa Cruz, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, and the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles
have visited the 32-foot diameter, 3-foot deep tank for a chance to
see the beaked whales.

   Jordan on Saturday released all remaining
political activists arrested after April riots over price increases,
the national police chief said.
   Gen. Abdul Hadi Majali said 60 Communist Party members were
released Saturday evening after four months of detention.
   Security officials rounded up Communist Party members and other
political activists after riots erupted in dozens of towns over
price increases and economic difficulties.
   At least nine people were killed and more than 90 were injured.
   Most of the rioters at the time insisted that the unrest was not
spawned by any group, although police arrested a variety of
leftists, independent government critics and Islamic fundamentalists.
   Communists distributed anti-government leaflets during the riots,
but most of the leaflets were circulated in cities where no
disturbances occurred.
   Majali said the release was in line with King Hussein's wish to
``reunite them (detainees) with their families.''
   Majali said those freed were ``the only detainees'' who remained
in prison following the riots.
   Many detainees were released within a few days of their arrest.
In May, Interior Minister Salem Masadeh announced that an additional
68 political activists had been freed.
   Jordan banned political parties in 1957 following a coup attempt.

   Casino gambling, with the lure of big
money and jobs for an economically distressed community, has turned
Indian against Indian on the St. Regis Akwesasne Indian Reservation.
   One of seven gambling houses on the reservation straddling the
U.S.-Canada border has been burned and guns have been fired in
recent weeks _ and the violence threatens to escalate.
   Pro- and anti-gambling factions squared off again Saturday when
about 25 Indians barricaded themselves inside a bingo hall, but
state police said there were no arrests and injuries reportedly were
minor during the fracas.
   ``The lawlessness on Akwesasne is out of control,'' said Michael
Mitchell, Grand Chief of the Canadian Mohawk Council of Akwesasne,
who has declared a state of emergency on the reservation. ``Never
before has the threat of violence been so real.''
   At least 11 people were injured in a clash between Mohawks and
state troopers during a 10-day standoff in July, after the troopers
and the FBI raided the casinos. Now, a self-appointed security force
equipped with automatic weapons, the Warriors Society, guards
against outside intrusion, and state police visit rarely and only
under strict conditions.
   On the reservation, anti-gambling vigilante groups spontaneously
attack the casinos, whose owners employ armed security guards.
   ``It's just crazy now _ complete chaos,'' said Harold Tarbell, an
elected chief who opposes gambling.
   ``People are pushed into a corner because it has dragged on so
long,'' said Edward Smoke, another anti-gambling leader. ``There's a
lot of people saying, `We have to take it into our own hands.'''
   Opponents argue against gambling on moral grounds and say it will
attract criminal elements. Advocates view it as a form of economic
development, bringing millions of dollars onto the reservation.
   Until most of the casinos were closed following a July 20 raid,
busloads of people from both sides of the border would visit the
reservation's gambling parlors, which employed about 500 people _
about a tenth of the reservation's population.
   Mohawks who support gambling say the reservation is a sovereign
nation, not subject to state and federal laws against gambling. The
U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 banned state and local regulation of
gambling on reservations until Congress allows the regulation.
   But leaders of the three tribal governments that claim
jurisdiction at St. Regis oppose gambling, and federal and state
authorities, saying Akwesasne leaders asked them to, have raided the
casinos several times. In the last two raids in June and July,
authorities arrested 13 people on federal gambling charges and
seized 300 slot machines.
   The July 20 raid prompted the standoff between state police and
Mohawks, with troopers cutting off the reservation from the outside
world for several days.
   After the clash, state police did not return to the reservation
until Warriors Society leaders set guidelines demanding that
troopers notify them in advance when they wish to enter the
reservation, and then come in an unmarked car and wait for an escort.
   State police have abided by the stipulations with one exception,
a stolen car chase that ended with troopers shooting out the tires
of the fleeing car on Indian territory. The Warriors Society, which
was not alerted to the chase, impounded the car and condemned the
troopers for firing their weapons on Indian property.
   ``We will protect ourselves from outside forces if they come
uninvited and do not follow the proper procedures,'' said Warriors
spokesman Mark Maracle.
   On Tuesday, shots were fired at the largest of the reservation's
casinos, Tony's Vegas International, knocking out power to it and
another gambling parlor. Once before, anti-gambling forces broke
into Tony's casino and smashed several dozen slot machines.
   Last Sunday, there was a confrontation involving more than 500
people _ many brandishing bats or knives. Afterward, firebombs were
tossed into Veronica Adams' newly converted casino, badly damaging
it. Gambling supporters blamed anti-gambling forces; county fire
officials suspect arson and continue to investigate.
   Asked who burned her casino, Adams shook her head in disbelief
and said, ``People I thought were my friends. Everyday people that
live on the reservation.''
   ``They came in with guns and shot up my door,'' Adams charged.
   ``If I am threatened again, I will retaliate,'' she said. ``I
tried to be calm and tried to go by the books.''
   Maracle said there is an urgent need for the various factions to
work out their differences _ without outside interference.
   ``We don't want to be fighting Indian against Indian people,''
said Maracle, whose group advocates sovereignty but has remained
neutral on gambling.
   ``Hatred and hard feelings causes segregation in our community.
In order for the barriers to come down, we have to sit down and
reason with each other,'' he said.

<UNK>To Transfer Vietnemese Refugees Because of Outbreak of Cholera.</UNK>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 4,000 Vietnamese refugees living on barren
Tai A Chau Island will be transferred next week because of an
outbreak of cholera, the Hong Kong government announced.
   Alistair Asprey, acting secretary for security, told reporters
that the refugees, living in tent camps, will be moved to another
island where living conditions are much better.
   Fighting broke out in another camp early Saturday, and police
said one person was killed and 11 people were injured.
   Five more Vietnamese boat people were confirmed to have been
stricken with cholera on Tai A Chau Friday, bringing to 11 the
number of Vietnamese suffering with the disease, a government
statement said.
   It listed the latest victims as an 8-month-old baby, a man and
three women.
   All of the patients have teen hospitalized are in satisfactory
condition, according to the statement.
   The first case of cholera on Tai A Chau was detected Monday, one
day after rioting erupted on the island when some 1,000 refugees
attacked police following a dispute over rice distribution.
   The case was discovered as authorities moved in to the restore
the health centers and other public facilities damaged during the
rioting.
   More than 55,000 Vietnamese boat people are living in Hong Kong
awaiting resettlement or repatriation. The government began putting
boat people on Tai A Chau Island in June in an emergency measure to
deal with increasing number of refugees arriving in this British
colony.
   It is general procedure for the refugees on Tai A Chau to remain
there for about two weeks for innoculations and health checks and
then be sent to other camps, but the first three cholera patients
had been on the island for a month.
   Cramped living conditions, lack of work and fear of being
returned to their communist homeland have led to frequent bloody
clashes among the refugees and wutg camp guards.
   Police said 46 men were arrested Saturday after about 200 people
battled with clubs, rocks and bottles in the Shek Kong camp that
houses some 7,000 people.
   A police spokesman said a man died from head injuries and four of
the wounded were hospitalized.
   The spokesman said the violence was triggered by a fight Friday
fight involving 40 people and gambling on a volleball game.
   He said some people had placed bets on the match, organized by
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner For Refugees, and whem some
people who lost did not pay fighting ensued and two people were
injured.
   In a brawl Friday involving 30 people at the Lo Wu detention
center, a 19-year-old Vietnamese man was injured and a 23-year-old
man was arrested, police said.
   An estimated 2 million Vietnamese have fled their homeland since
communist forces defeated the U.S.-backed government in South
Vietnam in April 1975. Thousand left within months after the defeat
but the number of refugees is again increasing this year.
   Hong Kong, unable to cope with problem, has said it will begin
sending back to Vietnam those refugees who left for economic reasons
and not because of political persecution.

<HEAD>Premier Urges Non-Reformers to Leave Communist Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Miklos Nemeth on Saturday urged
communists burdened with past mistakes to leave the party, saying
those who cannot accept reform should feel free to form new
political parties.
   Also Saturday, orthodox Marxist Ferenc Berenyi was quoted as
saying his Munnich Ferenc Society, a Communist Party faction, is not
seeking a split. ``But we will become a party if necessary,'' he was
quoted as saying by the Nepszabadsag party daily.
   Reformist communists meanwhile published a letter drafted for the
Communist Party's Oct. 6 congress urging a break with traditional
communism and calling it a ``historical dead end.''
   The different factions are laying down their positions in
preparation for the congress. Nemeth warned a failure at the
congress to transform the party into an entity with broad appeal
``would result in unforseeable consequences.''
   After more than four decades of single-party rule, the communist
leadership in February endorsed the concept of multiparty democracy
and agreed to hold free elections by June. In recent months, dozens
of opposition political groups and clubs have been allowed to form.
   These and other changes have put Hungary in the forefront of
economic and political reform in the Soviet bloc, creating tension
with some neighbors that cling to traditional and rigid Marxist
systems.
   Reformists also have run into opposition at home, with orthodox
Marxists challenging their concepts.
   Partly because of the infighting, the party's strength has
diminished.
   Central Committee Secretary Gyoergy Fejti told a Saturday rally
at Fonyodliget, 90 miles southwest of Budapest, that an average of
10,000 members a month have left the party in recent months, while
it is attracting less than 200 new members a month.
   Fejti said 750,000 of the country's 10 million people now are
party members, the official MTI news agency reported.
   Decisions reached Friday by a meeting of the 113-member Central
Committee reflect the conflicting positions of senior party
officials.
   While rejecting a call by leading reformer Imre Pozsgay to
depoliticize the work place by dismantling communist political
organizations there, committee members agreed to open factories to
other parties.
   Nemeth, who along with Pozsgay is part of the four-member party
leadership, was considered sympathetic to reformists even before he
declared his support Saturday.
   He suggested those with ``ancient Bolshevik concepts ... (who)
cannot accept the necessity of radical changes ... form alliances
with those circles espousing far-left concepts and practices.''
   ``We cannot complete the work of the (October) congress with
people who are burdened with different mistakes and who are not
clean ... let us allow them to form other parties, and let us allow
them to leave in a civilized way,'' Nemeth declared.
   Responding to questions from reporters before the dinner, Nemeth
said he could conceive of a coalition of communist and non-communist
parties after the election.

   A U.N. emergency relief program for
southern Sudan has been a success but more aid would be needed next
year, the head of the operation said Saturday night.
   ``It's clear that there will be no repetition of the large scale
disaster'' of last year, when an estimated 250,000 people died, the
U.N. official, James Grant, told a news conference. ``The operation
is well on the road to accomplishing its purpose.''
   Grant said 94,000 tons of food, including 2 tons of medicine,
seeds and other non-food supplies, had been delivered to
distribution centers by the end of August.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan was launched in March with the aim of
providing 100,000 tons of food and other supplies to avert experts'
predictions of 100,000 deaths from starvation in the war-torn
southern half of Sudan.
   The famine in 1988 has been induced by the country's 6-year-old
civil war. Grant said this year's relief operation has cost $200
million so far, and another $10 million to $20 million will be
needed to see it through November. He said a program of equal size
will be required next year.

   A 16-month-old boy strapped into a car seat
was mauled to death by a 200-pound leopard that escaped from its
cage at the family's farm, authorities said.
   The child's grandmother had left the car door open after a
shopping trip Friday.
   ``She had carried a couple of packages into the house and
returned to get the child,'' said Ronnie Huntley, chief investigator
with the sheriff's department. ``That's when the leopard made its
attack.''
   ``The grandmother fought the leopard off,'' then drove the boy to
the hospital, he said.
   The child, Holden Brown-Cline, died at Chesterfield General
Hospital, officials said. The grandmother, Wilma Cline, was treated
for minor cuts.
   The boy's parents, Bob and De'Ann Cline, were in Pennsylvania on
Friday. They keep 12 lions and other big cats at their farm, and
take them to fairs and malls throughout the Southeast.
   Officials were unsure how the animal escaped, but Huntley said it
appeared the animal may have simply pushed against its cage enough
to bend the lock and escape.
   Huntley said officials tried to keep the animal cornered until
representatives from a zoo in Columbia could arrive and sedate the
animal. Cheraw is 80 miles northeast of Columbia.
   But the animal tried to flee, leading Chesterfield County Sheriff
Ralph Freeman to order it shot and killed, Huntley said.
   Freeman said they will investigate the death before deciding
whether to file charges.
   But Huntley said authorities were aware of the animals and had
checked on the situation before.
   ``It's appeared from our past observation that the animals were
well taken care of,'' he said. ``These folks are trainers and this
is just one of those unfortunate freak accidents.''

   A bomb on Saturday severely damaged
offices of a newspaper that has crusaded against drug lords, and
police said at least 84 people were wounded. U.S. advisers arrived
to help Colombia fight its narcotics war.
   Police also released documents Saturday showing that the reputed
No. 2 member of the Medellin cocaine cartel, Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha, owned at least 408 businesses. ``This guy probably didn't
know exactly what he had,'' said an police colonel on condition of
anonymity.
   News reports said Colombian properties owned by drug lords could
be worth $5.5 billion.
   In London, a newspaper report said British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher has pledged an ``extensive package of aid'' to
Colombia, including communications and surveillance equipment. There
was no immediate official comment on The Sunday Telegraph report.
   The bomb, which police said was packed with up to 220 pounds of
dynamite, exploded in a small truck parked at a gas station outside
El Espectador, Colombia's second-largest daily.
   The newspaper's editor was assassinated in 1986 by drug dealers.
   Also Saturday, terrorists bombed a beach house off Colombia's
Caribbean coast that belongs to the family of Luis Gabriel Cano, the
president of El Espectador's publishing company. He said no one
there was hurt.
   Bogota police late Saturday said 84 people were injured in the
bombing of the newspaper building. Police earlier had incorrectly
reported that a newspaper driver had died but said in the later
statement that he was in serious condition.
   Col. Alfonso Rosas said two men brought the truck into the gas
station for a fillup, then ``walked away, leaving a timing device
that would set off the bomb in less than five minutes.''
   The blast, heard 18 miles away throughout this capital of 6
million, toppled 6-foot chunks of concrete from the two-story
newspaper building. It wrecked the gas station, melting gasoline
pumps and sending shreds of aluminum flying 100 yards.
   The explosion blasted out all the windows in the newspaper
building and blew away desks and computers. The fire department
estimated damge at more than $1 million.
   The newspaper said it put together a makeshift newsroom and would
keep publishing.
   ``Colombia anxiously hopes the government carries out what it has
promised,'' the paper's management said in a statement, referring to
the current anti-drug drive, ``so that this wreckage (of the
newspaper) doesn't also turn out to be the ruins of democracy in
Colombia.''
   Most of the injured had been riding by in two city buses when the
explosion occurred. ``It was tremendous,'' said bus driver Jose
Ignacio Rojas, 54. Rojas was not hurt.
   ``The air from the blast knocked me two meters,'' said Jairo
Rodriguez, an employee of a small factory nearby that also sustained
heavy damage.
   El Espectador is one of the most respected newspapers in Latin
America for its opposition to government corruption and human rights
violations. The newspaper had been publishing stories calling for
stronger action against drug traffickers.
   On Dec. 17, 1986, El Espectador's editor, Guillermo Cano, was
assassinated by men firing submachine guns as he left the newspaper
building in his car.
   A Colombian Defense Ministry source, meanwhile, confirmed
Saturday that the first U.S. military advisers had arrived in the
country to prepare for the arrival of $65 million worth of military
hardware.
   The source, who is working with the advisers, said a team of
eight _ an officer and seven enlisted men _ had arrived from Panama
and was ``doing nothing more than setting up a mobile communications
unit to coordinate the arrival of the military equipment.''
   He denied reports that any of the U.S. military aid had arrived
in Colombia.
   The first of two U.S. cargo planes to be delivered to the
Colombian government landed Saturday at Howard Air Force Base in
Panama loaded with spare parts. The second plane was expected later
Saturday.
   The C-130B National Guard planes were from Louisville, Ky., and
Martinsburg, W. Va. They will be flown to Bogota Sunday.
   The Pentagon has said it will also send five UH-1H combat
helicopters, eight A-37 reconaissance jets, trucks, boats, radios,
grenade launchers, machine guns, rifles and pistols.
   The Pentagon said that up to 200 U.S. military personnel could
come to Colombia to help Colombians use the American equipment.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the Americans will be used
for ``training and logistic support'' but won't actually participate
in Colombian anti-drug operations.
   Drug barons in Colombia have waged a campaign of bombings,
assassinations and arson to force the government to back down from
its decision to extradite leading traffickers to the United States.
   The government decision came after a leading presidential
hopeful, Luis Carlos Galan, was assassinated Aug. 18. Drug lords
responded to the crackdown with a series of bombings and threats to
kill more officials.
   Anti-drug forces, acting under special emergency measures, have
seized estates, cars, yachts, motorcycles and planes thought to
belong to drug lords and have arrested suspects without formally
charging them with crimes.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Considering Denying Refugee Status to Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, together with several
federal agencies, has drafted plans to make large numbers of Soviet
Jews ineligible to enter the United States as refugees, according to
a published report.
   Under a State Department plan, Soviet Jews who have no relatives
or other ties to the United States would become ineligible for
admission as refugees, the New York Times reported in its Sunday
editions.
   At least half of Soviet Jewish applicants are in that category.
   One result of the proposal would be to encourage the rejected
applicants to go to Israel, a move Israeli officials would welcome,
the Times reported.
   Citing confidential State Department documents, the Times
reported that U.S. officials hope there will be ``direct charter
flights to Israel'' from Moscow for Soviet Jews who would be
ineligible to settle in America under the proposed guidelines.
   The United States for years has allowed Soviet Jews to choose
their destinations upon leaving the Soviet Union.
   But Bush administration officials say the United States no longer
can accommodate all of those who want to come here, the Times
reported. The paper said the administration is taking that posture
because of economic burdens it would impose on the government in
addition to the difficulty in proving that the Jews are political or
religious refugees.
   Soviet Jewish emigration jumped from 8,155 in 1987 to 18,965 last
year and is expected to exceed 48,000 this year, the Times said.
   The plan was developed secretly by a group of officials from the
Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI, the State Department and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Israeli officials said they welcomed the prospect that the
tighter U.S. restrictions would result in more Soviet Jews going to
Israel, the paper said. In addition, Israeli officials said an
influx of Soviet Jews would strengthen Israel, the Times said.
   While the administration is moving to restrict the influx of
Soviet Jews, Congress has moved in the opposite direction. Both
houses of Congress have approved bills that would make it easier for
Soviet Jews and evangelical Christians to come to the United States
as refugees.
   The Bush administration opposes the bills, saying they would
create large numbers of refugees who would impose large costs on the
government.
   Some American and Israeli officials say the persecution of Jews
in the Soviet Union has lessened under President Mikhail Gorbachev.
But many members of Congress and some American Jewish groups say
Gorbachev's openness policies have also given new life to
anti-Semitic groups.
   The administration's plan is causing debate among Jewish groups.
   Some groups say the United States has an obligation to admit
Soviet Jews after demanding for more than 15 years that Moscow let
them leave.
   ``We don't want to collaborate with the U.S. government on a
selection plan that bars Soviet Jews without close relatives in the
United States because that would disqualify some leaders of the
Soviet emigration movement,'' Pamela B. Cohen, president of the
Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, told the Times.
   But David A. Harris, Washington representative of the American
Jewish Committee, told the paper, ``A growing number of American
Jews are coming to believe that limits on refugee entry to the
United States would not be so terrible if they result in greater
voluntary migration to Israel.''
   Most of the administration's plan is subject to approval by Bush,
Secretary of State James Baker 3d and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, who supervises the INS and the FBI.

<HEAD>NTSB Wraps Up Hearing on Train Derailment, Pipeline Explosion</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. _ A week of testimony failed to establish
a link between a deadly train derailment and a pipeline explosion
here, although federal officials have said they believe the crash's
impact led to the blast.
   Four people were killed May 12 when a runaway Southern Pacific
General freight train jumped the tracks and smashed into dozens of
homes in a San Bernardino neighborhood. Two people died and 31 were
injured in the pipeline explosion May 25.
   But testimony from 33 witnesses last week could not establish a
causal link between the derailment and the explosion, said Lee V.
Dickinson, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board
panel that concluded its five-day hearings Friday.
   Investigators have said they believe either the impact of the
train accident or heavy equipment used to clean up debris from it
weakened the buried pipeline near the tracks, ultimately causing it
to explode.
   Dickinson also said that confusion and a lack of communication
between fire and safety officials hampered an inspection of the
pipeline after the derailment.
   ``The time of the accident, it's not the time to introduce
yourself,'' he said.
   City Fire Department personnel were not sure what state officials
were supposed to do after the train wreck, according to James Waite,
acting chief of the Pipeline Safety Division of the state Fire
Marshal's Office.
   On Thursday, Southern Pacific General Manager Lloyd Simpson
testified he believed that the pipeline had been fully examined when
he signed an agreement taking responsibility for the inspection.
   The agreement, signed by Simpson and San Bernardino City Attorney
James Penman, said Southern Pacific would be responsible for fully
exposing the section of pipeline near the train wreck. The city Fire
Department then was to examine the line.
   But James Knight, deputy chief of the San Bernardino Fire
Department, told the board on Monday that he had recommended to
David Andries of the Calnev Pipe Line Co. that the line at the
accident scene be entirely uncovered and examined for damage.
   Knight said he released the accident site to Calnev crews on May
15 assuming that the inspection would be conducted. Calnev resumed
pumping gasoline through the line the next day.
   Andries, Calnev's manager of operations, said the firm only
uncovered the line at four points where it was thought there may
have been damage.
   Another Calnev official had testified that inspection was
sufficient to determine whether further inspection of the line was
needed. The pipeline supplies about 90 percent of Las Vegas' gas.
   Dickinson said the NTSB would issue a final report next spring.

   A military tribunal convicted ousted Vice
President Idris Banna of corruption Saturday and sentenced him to 40
years in jail in the first trial of more than 30 politicians
arrested in a June coup.
   The tribunal said Banna would serve only half his sentence and
gave him a week to appeal the sentence to a higher military court.
   Banna was vice president of the governing five-man Supreme
Council until Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir ousted the
elected government of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi on June 30.
   The military government has detained el-Mahdi and more than 30 of
his advisers and says they will be tried for corruption.
   After the coup, state television showed films of authorities
seizing Banna's warehouses and finding thousands of cans of tomato
paste, articles of clothes and other items given by neighbouring
countries as emergency aid after August 1988 floods.
   At least 96 people died in floods that left millions homeless and
thousands without food.
   Tribunal Judge Abdul-Wahab Ahmed Osman, an army colonel, said the
tribunal is confiscating all Banna's property, but he did not say
what would happen to it.
   He said Banna was given 20 years in prison for subverting the
national economy, 10 years for squandering public funds and 10 years
for illegally making personal use of emergency aid that poured into
Sudan following the floods.
   Banna pleaded innocent.
   At the trial's first session Aug. 12, the tribunal turned down
Banna's request to be set free on bail to gather proof of his
innocence. In protest, Banna refused to participate in any of the
court's three hearings.

   Federal agents found 824 pounds of cocaine
concealed in a truck shipped from Honduras and 23,000 pounds of
marijuana was seized on a fishing boat with the help of the British
Navy, officials said Saturday.
   Customs Service agents found a 2-foot-deep false wall Friday near
the cab of a truck that arrived in the Port of Tampa aboard the
Honduran-registered cargo vessel Carib Haven, spokesman Michael
Sheehan said.
   He estimated the cocaine was worth about $5.6 million wholesale.
   Sheehan would not say who was scheduled to take delivery of the
truck but said Customs was working with the vessel's owners in its
investigation.
   In Key West, a 65-foot fishing boat was escorted to shore
Saturday after 23,000 pounds of marijuana was found aboard, said Lt.
Cmdr. Jeff Karonis.
   The U.S.-registered boat was intercepted by a Coast Guard cutter
Wednesday off Mexico's Yucatan peninsula about 500 miles southwest
of Miami, he said.
   Two British Navy vessels tracked the boat while the cutter
approached. The British Navy does not participate in anti-drug
operations in the region and was in the tropical waters only as part
of a routine patrol, Karonis said.
   Two U.S. citizens and a Colombian were taken into custody.

<HEAD>Iraq Calls For Direct Peace Talks With Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Iraqi official Saturday accused
Iran of sabotaging stalled peace talks by refusing to have direct
negotiations to formally end the 8-year Gulf War.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Nizzar Hamdoun said there can be no
lasting and comprehensive peace while Tehran rejects direct
negotiations.
   ``Peace is like marriage, it needs two partners,'' he said in an
interview. ``If only one is present, there's no marriage.''
   Hamdoun was responding to a statement by Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati last week in which he reiterated Tehran's
rejection of direct negotiations.
   ``A peace settlement has been put off until the Iranian
leadership takes the crucial decision to have face-to-face
negotiations,'' Hamdoun said.
   U.N.-sponsored peace talks began five days after a cease-fire
took effect in August 1988.
   But they quickly bogged down.
   A major stumbling block is a dispute over the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway that forms the southern boundary between the two Persian
Gulf states and is Iraq's main outlet to the gulf.
   Iraq insists that a 1975 treaty that drew the border down the
middle of the waterway, the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris
rivers, has been abrogated, leaving the frontier on the eastern,
Iranian bank.
   Iran says the treaty, which gave it navigation rights in the
watrway, is still valid.
   Hamdoun stressed that Baghdad is ready for a permanent peace
treaty, but said the Iranians are dragging their feet.
   Velayati and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz are in Yugoslavia
attending the non-aligned summit conference and are expected to meet
with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to fix a date
for resuming talks.
   U.N. officials said Perez de Cuellar will meet separately with
Velayati and Aziz to explore the possibility of resuming the
negotiations later this year.

   A flatbed truck crashed into a line of
motorcycles on a mountain road Saturday, killing five people and
injuring five, three of them critically, officials said.
   The driver of the one-ton flatbed truck, which was carrying a
load of wood, braked and slid before overturning and colliding with
at least five motorcycles on a Sierra Nevada highway at 1:25 p.m,
said California Highway Patrol Sgt. Rob Yates. All vehicles were
immediately engulfed in flames.
   ``Most of them were burned pretty severely, although we don't
know the exact cause of death,'' said Yates. ``It could've been the
impact.''
   Julie Miller, a spokeswoman for Marshall Hospital near
Placerville, said altogether there were about 40 motorcyclists in
the group who were on a trip to the Sierra Nevada for a Labor Day
festival.
   A team of CHP investigators is working to determine the cause of
the accident, Yates said.
   ``Obviously, somebody was on the wrong side of the road,'' Yates
said.
   The 24-year-old truck driver, Daniel DeWater of Shingle Springs,
suffered burns over 30 percent of his body and was in critical
condition, according to a spokeswoman at University Medical Center
in Sacramento. She did not identify herself.
   Two motorcyclists also were listed in critical condition in the
hospital's burn unit, where all three had been air-lifted. All
suffered second- and third-degree burns.
   The names and hometowns of the dead and the other injured victims
at the medical center were not released, but the injured included a
woman with burns over 90 percent of her body and a man with burns
over 60 percent of his body.
   Two other motorcyclists were treated at Marshall Hospital; one
was released and another was in stable condition, Miller said.
   The rural highway is in a heavily-forested area and is a private
U.S. Forest Service road that is open to the public, Yates said,
adding that it is well-maintained, paved and painted.
   The fire touched off a small brush fire that was quickly
controlled, Yates said.

<TEXT>
   A 14-party opposition coalition
Saturday chose Violeta Barrios de Chamorro as its presidential
candidate _ a newspaper publisher considered its most formidable
choice for the Feb. 25 election.
   The selection of the 59-year-old former member of the Sandinista
government comes after two days of heated discussions by
representatives of the National Opposition Union, whose members
range from communist to conservative.
   Virgilio Godoy, 55-year-old leader of the Independent Liberal
Party, was chosen as the coalition's vice presidential candidate.
   Coalition spokesman Rene Blandon said the Chamorro-Godoy ticket
received 10 of the 14 coalition votes, while three of the parties
abstained and one vote was annulled.
   She said supporters of businessman Enrique Bolanos for the vice
presidential candidacy were refusing to accept the final vote.
   ``Viva Enrique Bolanos!'' hecklers shouted while Godoy delivered
a brief message outside the coalition headquarters, promising he
would fight for ``a better system of coexistence.''
   Godoy was labor minister under the Sandinista government from
1979 to 1984 and is regarded with hostility by some working-class
groups for introducing low wages for workers. The average monthly
wage in Nicaragua is $40.
   About 100 people yelled for Mrs. Chamorro at coalition
headquarters, cheering ``Dona Violeta'' as she is known.
   ``We're going to fight for amnesty, so that the jails open and so
we can have forgiveness, love and peace,'' she said.
   ``Viva Pedro Joaquin Chamorro!'' she cried _ the name of her
assassinated husband.
   Supporters echoed her call.
   Her husband's shooting death in January 1978 followed his sharp
criticism of then President Anastasio Somoza through the family
newspaper, La Prensa.
   The killing of the popular Chamorro sparked a popular uprising
that ousted Somoza in July 1979 and helped the Sandinista National
Liberation Front into power.
   ``I'm going to repeat, in memory of my husband, the one thing he
wanted for Nicaragua: that Nicaragua will once again be a
republic,'' Mrs. Chamorro promised Saturday.
   The fact that she does not belong to any party, her widespread
recognition and image as a strong pro-democracy figure make her the
most formidable opposition choice for the presidential nomination.
   Although Bolanos and Godoy also had been mentioned as possible
presidential contenders, each was seen as too committed to their own
ideologies to be a unifying symbol for such a diverse coalition.
   Bolanos, an upper-class businessman whose land has been
confiscated by the Sandinistas, is viewed as leaning too far to the
right and being too vocal a supporter of private business.
   All anti-Sandinista groups agree their only chance of defeating
the Sandinista Front is through a united opposition.
   Mrs. Chamorro never has been elected to public office. Her only
role in government was as a member of the government junta from July
19, 1979, after Somoza fled the country, to April 1980, when she
resigned, citing ill health. Since then, she has been a strong
critic of the Sandinistas.
   Mrs. Chamorro has the backing of the United States. The
Sandinistas have called her a puppet of Washington.
   The Sandinistas have not chosen their candidate for the February
balloting.
   They have promised free and fair elections with equal access to
the news media.
   The National Opposition Union's platform calls for returning
confiscated property, dismantling the Sandinista People's Army,
retaining government control of foreign trade and liberalizing
domestic commerce.

   Baseball commissioner A. Bartlett
Giamatti suffered from heart disease and had a prior heart attack
several years ago, although he may not have known it, an autopsy
revealed Saturday.
   Giamatti, 51, a former Yale University president, died of a heart
attack Friday afternoon after being stricken at his summer residence
in Edgartown on the resort island of Martha's Vineyard.
   Dr. William Zane, a medical examiner for Barnstable County, said
Giamatti ``died as a result of constrictive coronary heart disease.
The manner of death was natural.''
   The autopsy revealed that Giamatti had had a mild heart attack
several years ago, Zane said. It was possible that Giamatti had
suffered the attack without realizing it, he said.
   His death came five months after he ascended from the top post at
the National League to become baseball commissioner and eight days
after he banned Pete Rose, baseball's all-time hit leader, for
betting on the game.
   Fay Vincent, deputy commissioner, was named acting commissioner
Saturday.
   Giamatti was found unconscious in his bed and in full cardiac
arrest when officers, responding to a call from one of his sons,
arrived at 3 p.m. He was pronounced dead about an hour and a half
later, said Matthew Stackpole of Martha's Vineyard Hospital.
   Edgartown police said Giamatti's wife, Toni, and his son, who
were with him when he died, left the island in the middle of the
night to return to their Hamden, Conn., home.
   Giamatti's body was taken by boat Saturday from the island to
Falmouth Hospital. The body was then driven to Connecticut,
according to hospital spokeswoman Kathy Regis.
   Friends had earlier suggested that the Rose affair had taken a
toll on Giamatti, a chain-smoker who called cigarettes his ``primary
vice.''
   But in an Aug. 18 interview with The Associated Press, Giamatti
brushed aside the notion that we was overstressed by the Rose matter.
   Funeral services and burial will be private, according to Beecher
&amp; Bennett Inc., a Hamden, Conn., funeral home. A memorial service
will be held later.
   The commissioner's death elicited a flood of testimonials from
the worlds of baseball and higher education for the versatile man
who made his mark both as a renowned Renaissance scholar and a
tough, world-wise administrator.
   At Fenway Park, the home of Giamatti's beloved Boston Red Sox,
the flag was lowered to half-staff before a contest with the Seattle
Mariners after word of his death reached the park.
   Roger Angell, a noted baseball historian and writer, held
Giamatti in high esteem.
   ``He was just beginning to make his contribution to baseball. He
was prepared to take the game into the future. He cared about its
history and values,'' Angell said the night of Giamatti's death.
``He was like no other figure in sports that I can think of.''
   President Bush, a fellow alumnus of Yale, where Giamatti was
president from 1978 to 1986, said the two were close friends and had
talked at length about the Rose case, and ``all through that I was
thinking of the difficulty that he had in setting these standards
that high and staying with it.''
   Former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, a longtime friend of
Giamatti and one of his neighbors on Martha's Vineyard, called the
death tragic.
   ``He was a dear friend and a human being whom I greatly loved and
admired,'' said Vance, a Yale graduate who also served on the
university's board of trustees.
   On Saturday, an executive council of baseball club owners
appointed Vincent acting commissioner. Baseball officials have said
Vincent, a 50-year-old former chief executive officer of Columbia
Pictures, is the leading candidate to succeed Giamatti.
   ``Fay Vincent is a wonderful man,'' said New York Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner.
   Born in Boston on April 4, 1938, Giamatti was only 40 when he
became Yale's youngest president in 200 years. He had joined the
Yale faculty in 1966 after teaching Italian and comparative
literature at Princeton University.
   Giamatti is survived by his wife and three children, Marcus
Bartlett, Paul Edward Valentine and Elena Walton Giamatti.

<TEXT>
   Rocker singer John Cougar Mellencamp's
wife has filed for divorce after eight years of marriage and is
seeking custody of their two young children.
   Victoria L. Mellencamp, 30, of Bloomington, filed for divorce
Aug. 18 in Monroe Superior Court. Her attorney, Andrew Mallor,
confirmed the action by telephone Saturday but declined to discuss
the case.
   The couple has been separated since May 1988.
   Victoria Mellencamp filed the petition four days after the birth
of Mellencamp's first grandchild, Elexis Suzanne Peach. The child's
mother, Michelle Peach, 18, is the daughter of the 37-year-old
Mellencamp and his first wife, Priscilla.
   Victoria Mellencamp is seeking custody of the couple's two
children, Teddi Joe, 8, and Justice, 4, and child support.
   A Mellencamp spokesman said the divorce is a personal matter and
he did not expect the singer to comment publicly. Mellencamp has
spent much of the summer at his 58-acre compound east of Bloomington
pursuing his hobby of oil painting.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passenger fares on Chinese trains, planes and
ships will roughly double as of Tuesday, providing additional funds
for the crowded transportation system and new burdens for
inflation-hit users.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu, in an announcement reported in the
official press Sunday, said the price increases will pay for
renovations and expansion of the transportation system.
   Yuan said train tickets will go up from the equivalent of a half
cent per person per kilometer (0.62 U.S. miles) to at least one cent.
   A lower-class sleeping berth from Beijing to Canton, 1,200 miles
to the south, has cost the equivalent of $16. A factory worker
receives an average $27 per month.
   Yuan said prices will increase by 77 percent for domestic air
flights but airline fares for foreigners will remain unchanged this
year.
   Eventually, however, foreigners and overseas Chinese also will
pay fare boosts, with prices for all transportation for visitors set
at 70 percent above what Chinese passengers pay, according to the
announcement. That is the same price ratio used under the old system.
   Inflation is running at a rate of 25 percent, down from a high of
36 percent last year but still above acceptable levels for China's
communist economy.

<HEAD>Zoo Officials Heartened As Panda Cub Stabilizes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The condition of a newborn giant panda cub,
clinging to life in an incubator at the National Zoo on Saturday,
worsened but finally stabilized as the tiny bear battles a serious
infection that claimed the lives of four other cubs born there,
officials said.
   ``The fact that she stopped declining is something we should
cling to for hope,'' said Michael H. Robinson, director of the
National Zoo. ``She was going down and we stopped it.''
   Robinson said the cub's condition worsened during the day, and
``it is now in a rather grave condition. It has a fever, infection
has increased and we've had to put it in the equivalent of an oxygen
tent.''
   Ling-Ling, a giant female panda, gave birth to the 4-ounce female
cub Friday morning in the Panda House at the zoo. The cub is
Ling-Ling's fifth. If it survives, it will be the first panda cub
successfully bred in a U.S. zoo.
   Zoo officials said the cub remains in a special incubator, tended
by doctors from both local veterinarian hospitals and Children's
Hospital in Washington.
   The cub's treatment is much like the care a seriously ill newborn
child would receive, officials said. The cub suffers from a high
white blood cell count and fluid in its lungs.
   Doctors said Ling-Ling is suffering from an infection and passed
the ailment onto her cub either before or during birth.
   Officials are treating the panda with glucose and antibiotics. A
tiny tube pumps nutrients directly into the cub's stomach.
   ``We've had help from a local hospital and our veterinarians are
working hard now to try and get the infection into remission and
hopefully to push it over into recovery,'' he said. However, he
said, ``It doesn't look too good at all, I'm sorry to say.''
   If the cub does survive immediate danger, zoo officials may have
to raise it away from its mother if she is not returned soon,
officials said. There is a chance the cub may be rejected by its
mother if it is kept too long. Authorities say a panda cub has never
been successfully raised by humans.
   Several hours after the birth, zoo officials anesthetized
Ling-Ling and took the cub to give her a shot of immunoglobulins
extracted from the blood of the father, Hsing-Hsing. Previously,
officials had been careful not to separate the mother from her
offspring.
   ``This really does show that our decision to remove the baby from
Ling-Ling was a correct one,'' Robinson said. ``If we hadn't done
that, we wouldn't have detected the infection and it would have had
no opportunity at all to survive. This way, at least we have a
fighting chance.''
   Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were given to the United States by the
Chinese government during President Nixon's visit to China in 1972.
Since that time they have mated on numerous occasions, but Ling-Ling
has only given birth four times _ including a set of twins in 1987.
   One of the cubs was born stillborn and the other three _
including both of the twins _ died shortly after birth. Ling-Ling's
longest-lived cub, one of the twins, lived four days before dying of
the same infection threatening her latest offspring.
   Pandas are an endangered species. Fewer than 1,000 have been
counted worldwide. Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing are the only giant
pandas on permanent display in the United States.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Tiran Nersoyan, former primate of the
Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, has died of
cancer. He was 85.
   Nersoyan died Friday at St. Luke's Hospital.
   He was elected primate in 1943. During his 10-year tenure, 11 new
churches were established and 21 priests added to the clergy.
   Nersoyan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, also was a founder of St.
Nersess Seminary in New Rochelle and a religious scholar who
lectured extensively.
   Nersoyan was born in 1904 in Aintab, Cilicia, in southern Turkey.
His family emigrated to Syria in 1915 during the massacres and
deportations of Armenians by the Ottoman rulers.
   He was ordained a priest in 1928, and in 1939 he was named pastor
of the Armenian community in London.
   Nersoyan was elected Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1957. But
his tenure ended when he was deported from Jordan the following year.
   He is survived by two sisters, Mariam Jebjian of Fort Lee, N.J.,
and Teshkhouyn Nersoyan of Aleppo, Syria, and a brother, Hagop, of
Dayton, Ohio.

<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebels claimed Saturday that
hundreds of Cuban combat troops have entered the southern African
country to help government forces fighting in the country's
12-year-old civil war.
   A Mozambican National Resistance statement said almost 600 Cuban
soldiers have arrived in Maputo in the past week and warned the
presence complicates ongoing peace talks.
   There was no immediate comment on the claims from President
Joaquim Chissano's Marxist government.
   Peace talks between the guerrilla organization and Mozambican
church leaders representing the government resumed this week in
Nairobi, Kenya. No details of the negotiations have been released by
either side or Kenyan mediators.
   During talks last month, the two sides said they exchanged peace
plans.
   The rebel statement, released in Lisbon and signed by the rebel's
resident delegate Manuel Frank, said the Cubans are members of
motorized infantry units. It said they arrived between Aug. 25 and
Monday in the Mozambican capital and more are slated to arrive next
week.
   According to Frank, government officials claim the Cubans are
Mozambicans returning from training in East Germany.
   The rebel claims come as Cuba is involved in a phased withdrawal
of about 50,000 troops in another southern African country, Angola,
under an agreement in exchange for South Africa pulling out its
troops from Angola and granting Namibia independence.
   Mozambique receives military aid from the Soviet Union and its
allies and has accepted several hundred Soviet, Cuban and East
German advisers.
   But the only foreign troops known to be fighting the rebels
alongside Mozambican government forces at present are 12,000
Zimbabwean soldiers protecting an oil pipeline and road and rail
links from Mozambique's Indian Ocean ports to their landlocked
nation.
   Saturday's guerrilla statement said the government has yet to
answer the rebels' call for direct talks.
   South Africa used to back Mozambique's guerrillas, but says it
ended its support in 1984 when it signed a mutual non-aggression
pact with Mozambique.
   No government now openly supports the rebels, who are accused of
widespread atrocities against civilians.

   Hurricane Gabrielle started out strong and has
surged to the 110 mph mark as it churns westward across the
mid-Atlantic, but it is still far from land, forecasters said
Saturday.
   Gabrielle, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season, formed
Thursday off the African coast and quickly grew to hurricane force,
74 mph or more.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle's center was located near 15.3 north
latitude and 46.3 west longitude, or about 1,100 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles in the West Indies. It was moving west-northwest at
20 mph.
   Additional strengthening is likely as the hurricane moves across
the tropical Atlantic, but forecasters gave the storm only a 10
percent chance of affecting the Lesser Antilles within the next
three days.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Felix has become nearly stationary.
Little movement was expected Saturday, but a gradual shift to the
northwest was expected Sunday.
   Its winds, which dipped below the 39 mph threshold for a named
storm Wednesday, picked up again to 40 mph, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of Felix remained near 33.5 north
latitude and 40.5 west longitude, or about 640 miles southwest of
the westernmost Azores.
   Neither storm is an immediate threat to land, forecasters said.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The militiaman whose killing of a
student in 1985 sparked protests that led to the downfall of the
Duvalier dictatorship has been sentenced to life in prison, a radio
station reported Saturday.
   Radio Haiti Inter said Augustin Majeune was convicted and
sentenced to life at hard labor Thursday by a jury in the
northwestern town of Gonaives for the death of 16-year-old Mackenson
Michel on Nov. 28, 1985.
   On that date, during a demonstration in Gonaives against the
regime of Jean-Claude Duvalier, Michel and two other high-school
students, Jean-Robert Cius and Daniel Israel, were killed by Tontons
Macoutes, Duvalier's dreaded private militia.
   The deaths provoked violent anti-government demonstrations
throughout the Caribbean island that forced Duvalier to flee into
exile in France in February 1986, ending 29 years of family rule.
   In September 1988, Cereste Saint-Phard, who had been the Gonaives
commander of the Tontons Macoutes, was found innocent in the killing
of Cius, slain in the courtyard of the Immaculate Conception Roman
Catholic seminary.
   Majeune was convicted of shooting Michel in an alley in front of
the seminary after the youth had witnessed the slaying of Cius.
Israel was bayoneted in a street adjacent to the seminary and died
in a hospital.
   Radio Haiti Inter did not say long Majeune's trial lasted or give
other details.

   K.O. ``Buddy'' Burbage, a speedy outfielder
who played professional baseball from 1929 to 1942 in the Negro
Leagues, died Wednesday. He was 84.
   Burbage, who played at a time when blacks were kept out of the
white major-leagues, began his career at Schenectady, N.Y., for the
Mohawk Giants and shortly moved to the Baltimore Black Socks of the
American Negro League.
   He also played for the Homestead Grays, the Pittsburgh Crawfords,
the Washington Black Senators and the Brooklyn Royal Giants.
   Knowlington Burbage, 5-foot-6{, grew up in South Philadelphia and
came up through the playground leagues _ where his given name was
shortened to ``Buddy.''
   He wasn't allowed to join the team at Central High School because
was already playing semipro, he recalled years later.
   From the postwar years until illness forced him to retire in
1975, Burbage made his living primarily as a baggage handler at 30th
Street Station, said his wife, Theresa, who survives him.

   Archbishop Tiran Nersoyan, former primate of the
Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, died Friday of
cancer. He was 85.
   He was elected primate in 1943. During his 10-year tenure, 11 new
churches were established and 21 priests added to the clergy.
   Nersoyan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, also was a founder of St.
Nersess Seminary in New Rochelle and a religious scholar who
lectured extensively.
   Nersoyan was born in 1904 in Aintab, Cilicia, in southern Turkey.
His family emigrated to Syria in 1915 during the massacres and
deportations of Armenians by the Ottoman rulers.
   He was ordained a priest in 1928, and in 1939 he was named pastor
of the Armenian community in London.
   Nersoyan was elected Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1957. But
his tenure ended when he was deported from Jordan the following year.

   Raised to be a gracious hostess and
housewife, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has been thrust upon the
political stage to play a leading role in turbulent Nicaragua.
   She was selected Saturday as the presidential candidate of a
14-party opposition coalition for the Feb. 25 general election.
   Dona Violeta, as she is called by supporters and enemies, is a
strong pro-democracy figure and her lack of formal political
affiliation makes her a unifying symbol for the National Opposition
Union. Coalition members range from communist to conservative
parties.
   Mrs. Chamorro's life resembles that of President Corazon Aquino
of the Philippines: Both women come from wealthy families, married
politically ambitious men and embarked on what they thought would be
a behind-the-scenes life.
   Both became widows, their husbands felled by assassins. Both
picked up their husbands' political torches and continued the work,
with very little preparation, experience or ambition of their own.
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro was shot down on a Managua street corner
in January 1978, allegedly at the direction of then President
Anastasio Somoza. His death provoked a civil war that culminated
with Somoza's ouster and the Sandinista National Liberation Front
taking power in July 1979.
   Mrs. Chamorro joined the provisional governing junta after Somoza
fled the country, but resigned 10 months later pleading bad health.
Later, she said the leftist Sandinistas had betrayed Nicaraguans by
failing to fulfill their promises of democracy.
   Recently she has said the Sandinistas ``are worse than Somoza.''
   Mrs. Chamorro has remained faithful to her husband's memory and
her first words to the crowd at coalition headquarters Saturday
night were: ``Viva Pedro Joaquin Chamorro!''
   In an interview published by her family's opposition newspaper La
Prensa shortly before the 10th anniversary of the Sandinista
revolution, Mrs. Chamorro said of her husband's death:
   ``It wasn't simply the traumatic change that every woman suffers
when her husband dies. What happened to me was something more
profound. ...
   ``I went from being a simple housewife to being a political
fighter following in my husband's footsteps.''
   La Prensa, a critic of Somoza and then of the Sandinistas, was
shut down for a year then reopened in October 1987 as part of the
Sandinistas' promises for more democracy.
   The Sandinistas accuse Mrs. Chamorro and La Prensa of being
``instruments of imperialism and of the Central Intelligence
Agency,'' and lately of being supporters of Somoza's hated national
guard.
   Yet La Prensa continues to have one of the largest circulations
in the country, and its editorial policy is summed up by Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro's slogan that ``Nicaragua will again be a
republic.''
   The political divisions in Nicaragua are felt even within the
Chamorro family. Of her four children, two are prominent
anti-Sandinistas and the other two are pro-government.
   Mrs. Chamorro's brother-in-law, Xavier Chamorro, is editor of the
pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario.

   Romania on Friday demanded the United Nations
withdraw from circulation a ``totally incoherent and venomous''
human rights report criticizing the country's communist leadership.
   Western and Third World members of a U.N. human rights panel
instead urged U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
investigate the personal situation of the report's author, Dumitru
Mazilu.
   Mazilu has been held incommunicado in Bucharest since 1986, when
he was asked to write a report on human rights and youth for the
U.N. Subcommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and
Protection of Minorities.
   He submitted the report last month and it was published as an
official U.N. document last week.
   Mazilu termed conditions in Romania ``nightmarish.'' He charged
the population was ruled by fear and subject to abject poverty while
the leadership lived in luxury.
   The subcommission voted, 12-4, with two abstentions, that Mazilu
update his report and travel to Geneva to discuss it at the next
annual meeting in 1990.
   A Romanian government official, Gheorghe Chirila, said the report
violated U.N. standards of impartiality and should not have been
published.
   ``It is a totally incoherent, venomous text, deprived of any
meaning'' he said. ``We demand that the document be withdrawn
immediately from circulation.''
   Romanian authorities alleged Mazilu lacked the ``mental
capacity'' to write an objective report. They have said he is too
ill to travel to Geneva to appear before the subcommission.
   ``Dumitru Mazilu continues to be a retired person for reasons of
health. He enjoys a respectable pension. He is free,'' Chirila said.
   But he acknowledged Bucharest has confiscated Mazilu's passport,
suggesting he was ``a citizen whose presence abroad would harm the
Romanian state.''
   In a letter sent with his report, Mazilu said he feared for his
life and for his family.
   Delegates of the 26-member subcommission technically are
independent of their governments. Government delegations and private
groups are allowed to take part in debates as observers.

   Arab militants stabbed to death three
Palestinians they accused of collaborating with Israel, and Israeli
troops shot and wounded 21 Arabs in the occupied territories, Arab
reports said Friday.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed the three deaths, but said one of
the victims was a drug dealer killed in a dispute with other
criminals.
   She said a second victim was a Palestinian inmate of Ketsiot
prison in southern Israel who was stabbed to death by another
prisoner during a riot Thursday night. Police are investigating the
circumstances, she said.
   Arab reporters identified the man as Jamal Othman Khalaf, 25, of
Gaza city. Khalaf was serving a 2{-year sentence for allegedly
carrying out directives of underground leaders of the Palestinian
uprising.
   Khalaf was the 11th Ketsiot inmate killed by fellow Palestinians
since the uprising began in December 1987. Arab reports said he was
suspected of collaborating with Israel's Shin Bet secret police.
   In the West Bank village of Keffin the body of Muhammed Herscheh,
45, was found with multiple stab wounds. Arab reports said the Shin
Bet had given Herscheh a gun for self defense.
   Masked youths in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah attacked
Muhammed Nasser Bul Bul, 38, with knives and axes as he was leaving
a mosque after Friday afternoon Moslem prayers, Arab and army
reports said. He died of his wounds later in the hospital, doctors
reported.
   Palestinians said Bul Bul was a ollaborator who received land
from Israel.
   The army spokeswoman denied the report and said the dead man was
a drug dealer killed by fellow criminals.
   A youth from Keffin was among four Palestinians shot and wounded
by troops Friday in the occupied West Bank.
   At least 17 Palestiniand were wounded in clashes with troops in
the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said. The army did not confirm any of
the casualties.
   The deaths bring the toll to 103 Palestinians killed by fellow
Arabs, most of them as suspected collaborators, since the uprising
against Israeli rule began in 1987. Troops and Jewish settlers have
killed 554 Palestinians and Arabs have killed 39 Jews in the
violence.

<HEAD>China Completes Demobilization of 1 Million Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has completed a four-year drive to
demobilize 1 million soldiers, including 600,000 officers, an
official daily said Saturday.
   The China Daily quoted an official of the Civil Affairs Ministry
as saying it had found civilian jobs for the last 16,000
ex-servicemen and women in the program.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping in 1985 announced plans to reduce the
People's Liberation Army of 4.2 million by 1 million to help reduce
military spending and make the Red Army a trimmer, more modern
fighting force.
   The troop cutbacks originally were to be made in one year, but
ran into delays, reportedly because of resistance from older
officers reluctant to give up benefits attached to their military
rank.
   The ministry said its basic policy was to return people to the
area from which they were recruited. It said that of 700,000 army
personnel resettled since last year, about 200,000 recruited from
cities and towns found jobs in enterprises and government
institutions. The remainder usually returned to their homes in the
countryside, it said.
   China's military in recent years has suffered budgetary pressures
as the reformist government shifted spending priorities to economic
development areas. Defense industries have been ordered to switch to
producing consumer goods, and money for new weapons systems has been
scarce.
   In 1988, defense received 7.49 percent of the budget, less than
half its share before 1980, and defense spending in actual terms is
expected to fall about 6 percent after inflation in 1989.
   The army played a key role in suppressing the pro-democracy
protests of April-June, however, and observers speculate military
leaders will use that as leverage to push for a bigger defense
budget.

an agreement at their meeting Sept. 22-23 expanding superpower
cooperation on human rights, administration sources say.
   The memorandum of understanding, now being drafted by federal
agencies, will also outline U.S.-Soviet cooperation on new topics,
such as rule of law, occupational safety and women's issues, said
Bush administration officials who spoke on condition that they not
be further identified.
   The agreement, the result of a Soviet request, is viewed by the
administration as a step toward President Bush's stated goal of
integrating the Soviet Union more deeply into the world community,
the officials said.
   The agenda for the Baker-Shevardnaze meeting, to be held in Grand
Teton National Park in Wyoming, also includes more customary
U.S.-Soviet issues, such as arms control, and regional conflicts in
Africa, Afghanistan, Cambodia and Central America, said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.

   Congress, facing a crowded foreign policy
agenda marked by both crisis and opportunity, apparently is eager to
help Poland with significantly more aid than proposed by President
Bush.
   But although Democratic and Republican leaders agree on the need
to help Poland's new governments demonstrate it can outperform the
communist regime it replaced, there is little sense of how much
additional money can be squeezed out of an already overburdened
budget.
   Overall, there is growing unease on Capitol Hill that the means
available do not match the magnitude of the global problems waiting
to be addressed.
   These include: How to deal with the challenge to the authority of
the government of Colombia by narcotics racketeers, how best to wage
the war on drugs, how to manage an era of warmer relations with the
Soviet Union, and how to deal with China in the aura of anger caused
by the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.

   The collapse of peace talks just a month
before Vietnam says it will withdraw its troops from Cambodia may
have guaranteed a new period of bloodshed for that turbulent land.
   The 19-nation peace talks that ended in Paris on Wednesday
offered an opportunity to end nearly 11 years of war. But
negotiators could not overcome the deep-seated hostility between the
Vietnamese-installed government and the Khmer Rouge, the largest
member of the guerrilla coalition.
   The hosts of the Paris conference, France and Indonesia, are to
begin consultations within six months to arrange a second round of
talks. Other diplomatic initiatives will continue.
   Interviews with two dozen officials in Vietnam and Cambodia
produced both hopeful and gloomy predictions. But it is certain the
nature of the conflict will change after Sept. 26, when Vietnam says
it will withdraw the last of its 26,000 soldiers.

   Jim Bakker's wife blamed his emotional
collapse on a reaction to medication and a former PTL official said
there's ``no way'' Bakker faked the breakdown, but a federal
prosecutor called it ``awfully suspect.''
   Whatever the truth, the future of the TV evangelist's fraud and
conspiracy trial is in doubt while he undergoes evaluation at a
psychiatric hospital at the Federal Correctional Institution at
Butner.
   The judge sent Bakker, sobbing, disheveled and shackled in arm
and leg chains, to Butner on Thursday after his psychiatrist
testified he had been hallucinating, curled in a fetal position and
hiding his head under a couch in his lawyer's office.
   The collapse came in the fourth day of Bakker's trial.
Prosecutors allege Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds
to finance a lavish lifestyle. If convicted of all 24 charges
against him, Bakker would face 120 years in prison and more than $5
million in fines.

   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, the alluring
honey-blonde whose feisty nature and eight trips to the altar
command more attention than her occasional movie career, is taking
on the Beverly Hills police force.
   Miss Gabor goes on trial Sept. 11 on charges she slapped a
Beverly Hills motorcycle cop who she says roughed her up June 14
after stopping her $215,000 Rolls-Royce convertible on a busy
thoroughfare.
   ``I tell you mainly why I go to trial: that this shouldn't happen
to other women,'' Miss Gabor said during an interview at her Bel-Air
mansion.
   ``They wanted to drop all the charges. And the funny part is they
wanted to make, how do you call, civic work for 100 hours. And this
guy (Rob Lowe) who had pornographic movies, he only got 20 hours
(community service).''

<TEXT>UNDATED: the book.    And, finally, Saginaw was asked to remove
a book called ``Young, Gay and Proud,'' an anthology of short stories,
poems and essays supportive of teen-agers who have homosexual tendencies.
   The complaint was filed by David A. Morel, the father of two young
daughters and a vice president of the 25-member Saginaw chapter of the
American Family Association, a religiously oriented group based in Tupelo,
Miss., formerly known as the National Federation for Decency. The chapter
embraces a principle known in the South as WRAP, White Ribbons Against
Pornography.    Morel, a church-going Baptist, objected to the book on
pornographic grounds. ``They go into detail on how to have sex between
two males. They get very explicit. ... Personally I think gay sex is wrong.
But there is no one out there who would accept my opinion, based on the
Bible, which points out it's wrong. But that doesn't carry much weight
in this country anymore. ... The country is founded on Christian principles,
but has deviated from it.''    Morel says pornography is addictive
in the same way alcohol and drugs are, and fears for his daughters' safety
as they grow up. ``I think we are all horrible rotten sinners,'' he said.
``The Bible says the heart of man is deceitfully wicked, and I think if
you dig deep enough we'll find that's true.''    The library reviewers
rejected his appeal. ``We felt, in fact, it was not enticing youngsters,
that it was intended to promote a sort of healthy self-image and that in
fact was a good thing to do once a person had made a personal decision,''
James said. ``We decided to keep it in the collection.''    It is only
one of some 400,000 books in the five Saginaw libraries. But it is part
of the diversity of books that can be found in any public library.   
``Many Voices, Many Books: Strength Through Diversity'' is the theme of
National Banned Books Week, Sept.23-30, sponsored by the library association.
``There are a lot of ideas out there I don't agree with,'' said Ms. Krug,
the association's guardian. ``But I don't think you can fight ideas
unless you know what they are. The solution to a bad idea is a good idea,
and ideas do build on one another.''    Libraries once practiced a concept
of balance, both sides of a controversy. But those were simpler days, when
there were only two sides. Things are so complex, opinions so varied, that
librarians now embrace the concept of diversity. But that does not keep
them out of trouble.    For instance, the library association filed one
of the record number of 80-plus amicus curiae briefs with the Supreme Court
in the recent Missouri abortion case. It was somehow listed on the abortion
side, and may have lost some members because of it.    The Missouri statute
would have limited the ability of publicly supported health-care officials
to ``counsel or encourage'' a woman to have an abortion. ``We have materials
in our collections that do just that,'' said Ms. Krug, ``often in very
strong terms. Our concern was just keeping them available on the shelf.
``If we had lost on that issue, which we did not, it would have
been the first time in our history that government had said that you may
not have some kind of information in publicly supported institutions.''
   Pat Conroy was understandably angry when some people in Charleston,
S.C., turned against his best-selling ``Prince of Tides,'' the story of
a South Carolina shrimper's family. ``Anytime the extreme right or the
extreme left gets in, books are always the first to go,'' he said.   
It started when English teacher Judy Fitzgerald of St. Andrews High School,
a public school in Charleston, assigned the book to her advanced English
class and asked them to obtain their parents' permission, a standard operating
procedure. After all, the class had already read ``The Scarlet Letter''
with no objection.    But the Rev. Elton Johnson Jr., himself a former
English teacher, objected, calling it ``trashy pulp pornography.'' He said
he scanned only the first 50 of 567 pages and found enough explicit language
to ``gag a maggot.''    Some students and faculty rebelled and put
up signs saying, ``Sorry, this quote had to be censored due to the fact
that you might learn something.''    But despite the fact that many of
the students read the book anyway, and the Charleston County school board
stopped short of banning the book, the protest pressured teachers to take
more care in assignments. Fitzgerald felt she had to withdraw the assignment.
   ``My students are writers in training,'' she said. ``It's very important
for them to see that this dream of success can be achieved out of South
Carolina and that they're not just hicks studying the realm of the untouchable.''
   Said author Conroy, ``This will scare teachers from assigning books
with any controversy at all. They're cutting the 20th century from literature.''
   At the base of many current censorship attempts is the Supreme Court
ruling that upheld the right of a Missouri school board to censor a student
newspaper. The extension of that ruling to school libraries is being tested
in Florida.    Despite the constant battle to preserve the sanctity of
the shelves, the passion for censorship continues unabated.    In Louisville,
Colo., an elementary school banned Halloween when parents said it promoted
devil worship. The ban was lifted when other parents protested it was depriving
their children of enjoyable activities.    But in North Pole, Alaska,
named after Santa's home base, a school banned the use of the word Christmas
in the holiday season on the basis that it violates separation of church
and state. The ban remains.

   Confusion Corner is the nickname for
the only traffic-light intersection in town.
   It could describe most parts of this 25-year-old community as
federal banking regulators begin seeking a buyer for the development
company that owns more than 10 percent of the town's land and nearly
all of the major recreation and public facilities.
   Residents are looking for reassurances that life will continue as
always amid the sprinkler-fed lawns and bicycles leaning unlocked
against evenly spaced palms on the western edge of the Everglades.
   ``The one thing I keep repeating is: `don't worry. Nothing is
going to change.' But as soon as they hear the federal government is
involved they panic,'' said Carl Strunk, president of Land Resources
Corp., which came under federal control in May.
   Land Resources is among the more curious jetsam of the nation's
savings and loan crisis, which has coughed up other odd thrift
institution holdings from llamas to a desert bordello.
   Land Resources was acquired in 1984 by Security Savings and Loan
of Scottsdale, Ariz., which previously owned a 64 percent stake and
paid off the company's $100 million debt to Citicorp. When the
thrift was declared insolvent this year, regulators seized its
assets.
   ``It's strange for sure,'' said William Crocker, appointed by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to oversee Security Savings, which
had about $1 billion in assets. ``Many S&amp;Ls had real estate, but to
own part of a town is really unusual.''
   This past week, Crocker said 60 to 80 information packets would
be sent to potential bidders around the world. The rundown of what's
for sale includes 29,000 home lots, two 18-hole golf courses, a
1,700-seat auditorium, a building supply store, a weekly newspaper
and a 121-room hotel with a restaurant.
   Although Land Resources has sold many of its former holdings,
including two shopping centers and a bowling alley, it remains the
largest employer of the town's 25,000 residents.
   Crocker said financially qualified bidders will be given tours of
Lehigh Acres later this month. Bids, accompanied by a $250,000
deposit, should be reviewed in November and a deal completed before
Christmas, he said.
   Crocker would not name parties that already have expressed
interest, and said only that the property is valued ``in the eight
figures.''
   This spring, Miami-based General Development Corp. offered about
$62.5 million for Land Resources, which also has smaller real estate
holdings in the central Florida towns of Sebring and Interlachen.
But the FDIC called off the sale.
   Strunk predicts Land Resources, which had about $45 million in
revenue last year, will be purchased by an established development
firm interested in maintaining operations rather its break-up value.
   ``I'm convinced the whole of this company is worth more than the
sum of its parts,'' said Strunk.
   Lehigh Acres _ like much of the Everglades fringe-lands _ was
part of a large cattle ranch network before the postwar development
boom. In 1954, about 60,500 acres of the Lucky Lee Ranch was
purchased to create a new town in Lee County, named for Confederate
Gen. Robert E. Lee. Land Resources acquired the property in 1968.
   Original plans were for a retirement haven for northern workers.
In one section targeted for ex-telephone employees, the streets bear
names such as Switchboard and Long Lines.
   Although nearly 90 percent of the lots are deeded, there are few
buildings outside the main roadways. Only blue road signs stand on
the many overgrown grid-pattern streets stretching into scrub-palm
brush.
   But other sections of Lehigh Acres are typical small-town
America: churches, banks, a small hospital, two Chinese restaurants
and a struggling industrial park.
   Doing some theoretical calculation, Strunk said Lehigh Acres has
the potential for about 400,000 residents if everyone came down to
build on the lots they own.
   That's a long way away, he admitted. Lehigh Acres is presently
growing by about 1,000 residents annually and Land Resources still
brings families down for subsidized vacations to tour the community
and time-share units. Less than half the residents now are retirees,
with the others mostly commuting to Fort Myers, about 12 miles
northeast, said Strunk.
   ``We're just like any small town anywhere,'' he said. ``It just
happens that a failed S&amp;L owned part of it.''
   But word of the federal takeover is a tender subject.
   In July, Strunk wrote a front-page article in the company-owned
Lehigh Times newspaper in an attempt to soothe local apprehension
about the sale. Strunk also has discouraged the nearly 500 Land
Resources employees from discussing the pending sale with reporters.
   ``This place is Mr. and Mrs. Middle America. It's Dayton, Ohio,
and Detroit, Mich. They are going to spend a lot of time worrying
about this if people keep sounding alarmed,'' said Strunk. ``I keep
saying it's not a big deal.''
   He may be right. At the K-Mart lunch counter, residents seemed
more concerned with gossip than speculation on the fate of Land
Resources.
   ``This town will survive,'' said Joseph Ferrante, a retired New
York police officer. ``At worst, maybe a new owner over there will
be good. It could be a change for the better.''

<HEAD>Bad Week For Wealthy Fraud Suspects; Pressure Builds on Holdout Milken</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The news about Queen Leona may have caused a stir
in King Michael's court.
   While the conviction of hotel billionairess Leona Helmsley on tax
cheating charges doesn't directly affect the predicament plaguing
junk-bond king Michael Milken, it was not a good week for people
charged with white-collar crimes.
   In addition to Leona, TV evangelist Jim Bakker collapsed in an
apparent breakdown during his fraud and conspiracy trial this past
week; stock speculator Salim B. Lewis pleaded guilty to securities
fraud charges; and a Chicago lawyer was sentenced to the
longest-ever prison term for insider trading.
   All of those events sent ominous signals about what Milken risks
if his case goes to trial. Milken, former head of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond unit, has pleaded innocent to 98
counts of securities fraud and racketeering.
   Like Milken, all four defendants in these other cases were
extremely wealthy _ Helmsley is one of the world's richest women.
All were accused of crimes that reflected arrogance, greed and
unbridled excess.
   Perhaps more important, the judicial process in the cases of
Helmsley and the attorney Alfred Elliott showed that judges and
juries are quite willing to punish white-collar felons as harshly as
suspects convicted for violent crimes.
   That fact may have played a role in the decision by Lewis to
strike a deal with federal prosecutors in New York and plead guilty
to three felonies for stock manipulation. Lewis originally had
asserted innocence and his lawyers had called his indictment ``a
piece of garbage.''
   Although jurors in the highly publicized Helmsley trial aquitted
her of the most serious charges, they were swayed by evidence that
she flaunted the tax laws to cheat the government of $1.2 million by
using falsified bills.
   In a case laced with the poetic-justice atmosphere of the French
Revolution's backlash against the rich, Mrs. Helmsley faces the
prospect of a prison stint, her designer clothes doffed for an
inmate jumpsuit, her luxurious staterooms sacrificed for a skinny
bunk mattress.
   To Milken and other prospective defendants in securities-fraud
cases, the punishment given to Elliott may have been even more
unsettling. The Chicago lawyer, who represented firms involved in
takeovers, was sentenced to five years in prison for trading stocks
on secret corporate information to make more than $600,000 in
illicit profits.
   That term is a record for insider trading and is two years longer
than the term given Ivan F. Boesky, considered the most notorious
inside trader in Wall Street history, who paid the government $100
million to settle his case and whose subsequent cooperation led to
the Milken indictment.
   Milken's trial isn't expected to start until next year, and the
possibility exists that he could strike a plea bargain. But there
was one intriguing disclosure this past week that suggested he might
fight to the end.
   The Washington Post quoted a secret Securities and Exchange
Commission memo as saying Boesky and Milken conferred in July 1986
about how to conceal a $5.3 million payment, the heart of the
government's case against Milken.
   The SEC memo raised the possibility that Boesky may have been
cooperating with the government at the time of the alleged
rendezvous with Milken and may have been ordered to entrap him. If
so, Milken's lawyers may have a powerful new tool to discredit the
government's case.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Government reports on the economy were generally favorable, but
one private report was less optimistic. The Labor Department said
unemployment steadied in August at 5.2 percent and revised the June
and July job-growth figures upward. At the same time, the National
Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic
statistics suggested a serious slowdown in August.
   _Japan's pre-eminence in the world banking industry and its
rapidly growing image as a stock-fraud playground were reinforced by
the merger of Mitsui Bank Ltd. and Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., which would
create the second-largest banking company behind Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank Ltd. Immediately after the merger was disclosed, Japanese
securities regulators said they were checking suspicous trades of
stock in the two banks prior to the announcement.
   _Takeover rumors and counter-rumors roiled the airline industry,
centering on new or revised bids for United, American and
Continental that could include foreign-airline partners.
   _The merger &amp; acquisitions business also extended into the
children's entertainment industry, where Walt Disney Co. acquired
Henson Associates Inc., owner of the Muppet characters. The deal
adds Kermit and Miss Piggy to the Mickey Mouse club.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As summer draws to a close over Labor Day
weekend, many conversations at cookouts and cocktail parties likely
will turn to what the stock market's record-setting August means for
September and beyond.
   Unlike past years when trading often was becalmed in the summer
with investors taking holidays away from Wall Street, the past month
earned a place in the history books.
   Most notably, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finally
achieved what several other closely watched stock performance
measures already had accomplished, reaching an all-time high after
setting many post-crash highs.
   On Aug. 24, the Dow average made its first move into uncharted
territory since before the Oct. 19, 1987 crash, with a 56.53-point
surge to 2,734.64. It extended the advance the last week in the
month, reaching 2,743.36 on Aug. 28. The previous record of 2,722.42
had stood since Aug. 25, 1987.
   Broader indicators turned in comparable performances. The New
York Stock Exchange's composite index of all listed common stocks
repeatedly hit new highs in August as did Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock composite index.
   Stock buyers were motivated partly by hopes of profiting from
acquisitions or takeover attempts. Much of the thrust behind the
market's move came from airlines, for instance.
   UAL Corp. soared when news surfaced that Los Angeles investor
Marvin Davis was seeking the parent of United Airlines. The stock
continued to roar along on news United's pilots union, joined by
management and British Airways PLC, were formulating a bid for UAL,
leaving the ownership question up in the air.
   UAL, trading in the $170s early in the summer, flew up to around
$280 by the end of August and helped the Dow Jones average of 20
transportation issues zoom to previously unseen altitudes.
   The steep climb in the Dow Jones transportation average triggered
buying by market technicians who decided their charts were pointing
to future gains in stock prices.
   Mergers among pharmaceutical companies acting to increase
competitive clout by joining forces attracted speculators to drug
stocks. The latest deal was revealed in late July when Bristol-Myers
Co. said it would absorb Squibb Corp. in an $11 billion stock swap.
The announcement encouraged buying in the sector.
   The ability of stocks to scale new heights was noteworthy in that
it occurred without much support from the bond market.
   A bond rally fueled by expectations of easier credit ran out of
energy in August once the view started spreading around financial
markets that the economy might not need the stimulation of lower
interest rates.
   As activity wound down Friday ahead of the long weekend, the Dow
Jones industrial average continued its advance. At the close of
business, the average stood at a record 2,752.09, up 14.82 points
from the previous session and 19.73 higher than a week before.
   Weekly readings for other market measures showed the New York
Stock Exchange composite index up 1.58 at a record 196.37; the
NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market up 4.59 at
471.34; and the American Stock Exchange market value index up 2.78
at 383.96..
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 151.49 million shares a day,
down from a daily average of 165.96 the week before.
   What lies ahead for the stock market depends partly on how
investors read the economic tea leaves. Government reports issued
Friday suggested the economy has adequate pep to sustain a moderate
expansion and the threat of a recession _something economists were
worried about earlier this summer _ is very remote.
   Regardless of what the economy does, though, forecasters seem to
agree that the stock market is due for a period of consolidation.
   ``It was really a pretty spectacular month,'' said Hugh Johnson,
economist at First Albany Corp. ``I don't look for anything near the
August gains in September. Common sense says we have to have a
breather.''
