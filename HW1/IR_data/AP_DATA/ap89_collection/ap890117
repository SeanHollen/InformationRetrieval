<HEAD>Bush Meets with Teamsters Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush met Tuesday with leaders
of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to thank the union
officials for their support in his election to the White House,
according to a Bush spokesman.
   The meeting included six Teamsters officials who are scheduled to
go on trial next month as the result of a Justice Department civil
suit accusing them of racketeering, The Washington Post reported in
its Wednesday editions.
   The brief session was held in the office of John H. Sununu,
Bush's incoming chief of staff, said Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for
Bush. The meeting had not been publicly announced.
   ``The Teamsters people were meeting with Sununu and the
president-elect simply stopped by briefly. The purpose was to thank
them for their support during the election campaign,'' she said.
   The meeting was set up by the Bush campaign and William J.
McCarthy, president of the Teamsters, Ms. Tate said.
   The Post reported that Sununu noted the Justice Department case
against the Teamsters but said any discussion of the case would be
inappropriate in the meeting.
   Last June, the Justice Department filed suit in New York,
charging that the Teamsters were infiltrated by organized crime and
urging a federal court to put the union under government trusteeship.
   The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 27 and the 18
defendants include McCarthy and others in the group who met with
Bush and Sununu, the Post reported.
   In 1981 and 1985, after the election of President Reagan and Vice
President Bush, Bush had appeared at the union's board meetings
during inaugural week to thank the organization for endorsing the
Reagan-Bush ticket.
   According to the Post, the meeting Tuesday was in lieu of a
public appearance by Bush at a Teamsters' board meeting, which union
officials had sought.

   The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson has expressed concern
for District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry's ``health and
well-being'' in recent weeks, the Washington Post said in its
Wednesday's editions.
   Jackson told the newspaper he has talked and prayed privately
with Barry and is seeking to counsel the embattled major.
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Jackson said his involvement is
personal and not political. Jackson declined to defend or criticze
Barry, whose latest controversy involves visits to a former city
employee under a drug investigation at a downtown hotel, the Post
said.
   ``I'm in no position to make a political evaluation of the
current situation,'' the paper quoted Jackson as saying. ``My first
consideration is his health and well-being.''
   Jackson said he intends to visit with Barry this week while
Jackson is here for the presidential inauguration.
   ``I know the burden of being under attack. I have been there,''
Jackson said. ``People are hurt and their families are hurt.''

   A young drifter wearing combat fatigues
opened fire with an assault rifle at screaming children in an
elementary school yard Tuesday. Five children, all refugees from
Southeast Asia, were killed and 30 people wounded before the gunman
shot himself to death.
   The gunman, identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26, originally of
Stockton, had an ``extensive criminal history'' but police had ``no
idea'' of a motive, said Lucian Neely, deputy police chief of this
agricultural city 60 miles east of San Francisco.
   ``He was just standing there with a gun, making wide sweeps,''
said Lori Mackey, who teaches deaf children at the Cleveland
Elementary School and ran to her window when she heard what she
thought were firecrackers.
   She said she saw a man standing in the schoolyard, spraying
gunfire back and forth from a Russian AK-47 assault rifle as 400-500
pupils from grades 1-3 played at recess. She said when she realized
what was happening, she took her 10 students into a rear room where
they couldn't be seen.
   ``He was not talking, he was not yelling, he was very
straight-faced, it did not look like he was really angry, it was
just matter-of-factly,'' she said of the gunman, whom she described
as about 5-10 with short dirty-blond hair.
   ``There was mass chaos. There were kids running in every
direction,'' she said.
   Purdy, also known as Patrick West, had lived most recently in
Lodi, about 15 miles northeast of here. Prior to that he lived in
Sandy, Ore., where he purchased an AK-47 from the Sandy Trading Post
on Aug. 3., said Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel.
   Purdy's criminal record was mostly in the Los Angeles area and
included narcotics and weapons violations and soliciting for sex,
Neely said.
   Punzel said Purdy had lived with an aunt and uncle in Sandy for
several months until October and the aunt, Julie Michael, ``told me
he was a loner and as a child he was an alcoholic.'' He said Purdy
also had apparently been living in Texas, Memphis, Tenn., and
Connecticut since leaving Oregon.
   The gunman, dressed in battle gear and wearing a flak jacket,
parked his car near the school, then set it on fire as a diversion
before entering the campus through a gap in a fence at about 11:40
a.m. PST with two handguns and an AK-47 ``with a full banana clip,''
police said.
   He opened fire on the west side of a group of portable
classrooms, then moved to the east side and continued firing across
the blacktop yard, towards the main buildings about 250 yards away,
Neely said. Purdy was no closer than that when he shot himself in
the head, Neely said.
   About 60 rounds were fired; in some cases, the bullets went
completely through the main school building and came out the other
side to fall spent on the L-shaped school's front lawn, Neely said.
   As police cleaned up the carnage, a large handgun and the AK-47
were seen lying on the ground near a pool of blood. Written on the
pistol's handle was the word ``Victory.''
   Bruce Fernandes, a spokesman for the San Joaquin County Office of
Emergency Services, said five pupils were killed and 29 wounded in
the schoolyard. A teacher was also shot.
   Neely said two of the dead children were dragged inside the
school by teachers. At least 15 of the wounded were in critical
condition, he said.
   Neely said the dead children all belonged to refugee families
from Southeast Asia. He identified them as Raphanar Or, 9; Ram Chun,
8; Thuy Tran, 6; Sokhim An, 6; and Oeun Lim, 8. Thuy Tran was from
Vietnam, the others from Cambodia. Officials said about 60 percent
of the pupils at the school were from Southeast Asian refugee
families.
   Three of the children were slain in the yard, and the two others
inside the school, said Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble. He said
at least one teacher was injured.
   ``There were a dozen students lying on the ground. It was very
frightening,'' said Cheryl Torres, who rushed to the school where
her 11-year-old daughter, LeAnne Sundstrom, is a pupil.
   Fernandes said the wounded were evacuated to eight hospitals in
the area. Two helicopters and a fleet of ambulances were pressed
into service to transport the victims.
   Ramon Billedo III, a pupil at the school, described seeing a
schoolmate shot.
   ``I just saw him fall down,'' said Billedo. ``His head hit the
ground. The teacher grabbed him and dragged him inside the other
classroom.''
   ``Some kids were outside and some man came over here shooting
like crazy. A few kids got shot,'' said Ricardo Rivera, 10, a fifth
grader.
   ``They were shooting at my classroom and at (Rivera's) classroom
at reading time,'' said another pupil, Roberto Costa. ``The bullets
were hitting the walls. Everybody got scared.''
   Brian Griggs, visiting a friend across from the school when he
heard gunfire, ran to the scene.
   ``When you see bodies lying on a playground, you know it's, you
know...,'' Griggs said, his voice trailing off.
   ``I tried to get a pulse, couldn't get a pulse. I was hoping an
ambulance would show up. It seemed to take forever.''
   The school, about four blocks from the University of Pacific
campus, is in a middle-class residential area. Several churches are
nearby.
   The AK-47 is a Russian design, but Chinese replicas are available
in many gun stores for around $300. It is capable of firing about
600 rounds per minute on full automatic.
   Lt. Fred Nixon of the Los Angeles Police Department described the
AK-47 as a ``military assault rifle. You use it for one purpose and
one purpose only _ to kill a human being.''
   Under federal law, the purchase of a fully automatic rifle or
machine gun requires a 4-6 month background check by authorities;
however, a semiautomatic rifle can be bought over the counter by
completing a standard form stating that the applicant has no
criminal record, among other requirements.
   Punzel said that the AK-47 and other semiautomatic rifles can be
easily converted into automatics.
   Other schools across the nation have been the targets for violent
attacks in recent years.
   Last Sept. 26, a man walked into Oakland Elementary School in
Greenwood, S.C., and opened fire with a gun in a crowded cafeteria
and in a third-grade classroom. Two 8-year-old girls died, and nine
other people were wounded, including two teachers. The gunman,
identified by police as Jamie Wilson, 19, of Greenwood, was charged
with murder and is awaiting trial.
   Last May 20, a young woman named Laurie Dann went on a rampage at
Hubbard Woods Elementary school in Winnetka, Ill., killing an
8-year-old boy and wounding five other children. She fled to a
nearby home where she wounded one man and then killed herself.

<TEXT>
   Within hours of the schoolyard shootings
that left five children and the gunman dead and 30 wounded Tuesday,
dozens of translators rushed to assist the many Southeast Asian
parents who arrived at the hospital desperate for word of their
youngsters.
   ``I would imagine it is absolute panic. They are not sure what
happened, not sure what's going on around them,'' said Laura Dixon,
of the Charterhouse Center refugee program, in Stockton, describing
the scene translators found when they arrived at San Joaquin County
General Hospital.
   Many of the parents speak no English and were unable to ask
whether their children were among those killed or wounded when a
heavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded Cleveland Elementary
School and opened fire before taking his own life.
   ``They do have people on staff at the hospital, but they are so
overloaded they need every extra person they can secure,'' said
Dixon, whose organization began calling throughout Stockton for
volunteers speaking Southeast Asian languages. About a dozen
translators were sent to the county hospital, after officials there
called for help.
   In recent years, thousands of Southeast Asians have settled in
Stockton, drawn in part by the farming and fishing that flourish in
the area. School officials said 60 percent of the children were
Southeast Asian refugees _ either from Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.
   All five of the children killed were of this background,
authorities said.
   A Stockton woman who runs an after-school program teaching
English to Cambodian refugees dispatched 25 translators, including
volunteers from all over the city, to the school and the hospital,
Dixon said.
   The San Joaquin County Mental Health Department told Dixon a
grief center might be established at Charterhouse to help survivors,
whose recovery will be complicated by the language barrier.
   Charterhouse is funded by the Episcopal Church and private
donations.

<HEAD>Diplomats Report Busy Soviet Withdrawal; Fresh Ammo for Afghans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fully equipped Soviet troops left
Afghanistan by the planeload during the past week, but the aircraft
also left tons of new arms and ammunition for the Kabul government,
diplomatic sources said Tuesday.
   Western diplomats, speaking in Islamabad on condition they not be
identified further, said that at the current pace, the Red Army's
withdrawal could be completed by the end of the month.
   ``However, for political reasons the Russians may wish to keep a
military presence in Kabul up to Feb. 15,'' said one source.
   Moscow pledged in a U.N.-sponsored accord last year to remove all
of its more than 100,000 combat troops from Afghanistan in nine
months from May 15, 1988.
   But the country's ruling Marxists still have not reached a
settlement with Moslem rebels known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors,
who have battled them for more than a decade.
   Diplomats said takeoffs and landings of Soviet IL-76 transport
planes at Kabul airport numbered about 40 between Jan. 9 and 14, or
double the usual rate.
   Armed Soviet troops in full kit were seen boarding the planes but
only after Afghan troops unloaded large quantities of military
equipment and ammunition.
   As many as 18 SS-1 ``Scud'' missiles were transported from the
airport during the period, according to reports from diplomats and
Western journalists.
   Soviet armor has been digging into new positions north of the
Hindukush mountains along the snowbound Salang Road which runs some
240 miles from Kabul north to the Soviet Union, the sources said.
   They said that judging by convoys arriving in Kabul,
Soviet-Afghan forces apparently have been able to keep the route
open despite harassment by the mujahedeen.
   Diplomats said workmen have been busy cutting down trees and
leveling earth along the avenue that runs past the Afghan Defense
Ministry and Soviet Embassy in southern Kabul.
   One source speculated that the work was to prepare an emergency
airstrip next to the Soviet mission.
   Moscow and Kabul continue to accuse Islamabad and Washington of
violating the pullout accord by continuing to arm and supply the
rebels, many of whom operate from bases in Pakistan.

   The death toll rose to eight Monday in the
city's worst fire in 24 years and authorities said a man smoking in
bed may have caused the blaze that ravaged a three-story rooming
house.
   Yonkers Fire Commissioner William McLaughlin said the house
originally was a two-family dwelling, which had been illegally
converted into a rooming house by its owner, Frank Thomas. It was
not immediately known if charges would be filed against Thomas.
   McLaughlin said the heaviest fire damage was in the vicinity of a
cot used by the smoker, a man who was not identified.
   ``We're probably looking at smoking. The victim is reported to be
a heavy smoker'' and drinker, McLaughlin said. He said the man was
intoxicated the night of the fire.
   The eighth person to die from injuries suffered in the Sunday
fire was identified as Bernice Mahler. Mrs. Mahler's husband,
Harold, 77, and 45-year-old son, Eugene, died in the fire from burns
and smoke inhalation, said Dr. Louis Roh, the deputy medical
examiner. He said an autopsy on Mrs. Mahler was scheduled for
Tuesday.
   The other fire victims were identified as Abraham Wilson, 52,
Allen Prioleau, 61, Cynthia Walker, 28, and Keith Isabelle, 30.
   Two of the bodies were found inside the front door. Authorities
said the men had been unable to open the door because it had been
locked from the inside and required a key to open.
   Seven people were injured in the blaze. Eleven to 15 people were
living in the house, officials said.

<HEAD>Gynecologist Offers to Surrender Certificate to Practice Medicine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gynecologist who faces charges from the
State Medical Board in connection with what he calls ``love
surgery'' has offered to surrender his certificate to practice
medicine, his attorney said Tuesday.
   Lawyer Earl Moore said he and Dr. James C. Burt made the offer
during a meeting with state officials in Columbus.
   ``We offered to surrender the license and dispense with the
hearing,'' said Moore. ``Whether they do that or not, I don't know.
Otherwise, we'll go ahead with the hearing.''
   The board has charged the 67-year-old Burt with ``gross
immorality'' for 41 alleged violations ranging from overprescribing
drugs to performing unnecessary surgeries.
   Most of the charges against Burt have to do with the
controversial surgery in which he rebuilt women's genital areas,
allegedly to enhance their sexual responsiveness.
   The surgery, however, instead caused sexual dysfunction,
emotional distress, infection, chronic pain, incontinence and the
need for corrective surgery in many patients, the board charged.
   Last month, Burt sent a letter to the board denying the charges
and requesting a hearing. The board tentatively set a Jan. 30
hearing date.
   Moore predicted that such a hearing would last six weeks. And he
said Burt has, in effect, retired anyway.
   ``He's not practicing any medicine at all,'' said Moore. ``We
offered to surrender the certificate to practice medicine and
surgery. I'm certain that he feels they will ultimately revoke his
license. He feels it's a worthless cause.''
   Calls to Burt's office went unanswered, and no one answered the
phone at the State Medical Board.
   Board spokeswoman Lauren Lubow has said the severest penalty the
state board could impose would be permanent revocation of Burt's
license. The board limited Burt to non-surgical medical practice
last November.
   At least three of Burt's former patients have each filed $3
million medical malpractice suits against the gynecologist.
   Burt has denied performing the surgery without his patients'
permission. The surgery was last performed in February 1987 at St.
Elizabeth Medical Center.

<HEAD>Thoroughly Modern Nuns Audition for Part in Hit Musical</HEAD>

   She wore black stretch pants, a sequined vest and a
top hat. Sister Rena Foley did not look like a nun.
   Sister Brigid Riley looked the part in full Carmelite habit and
veil. But she didn't act it: She took to center stage like a veteran
performer and played snappy spoons to a bluegrass tune.
   Life imitated show business Monday as about a dozen real-life
nuns showed up at the Charles Street Playhouse to audition for the
musical ``Nunsense,'' a gentle spoof of convent life.
   Judging their performances was a panel of nun-impersonators, the
show's regular cast. The habit-wearing actresses sing, clown and
even tapdance in an off-beat comedy about nuns who stage a talent
show to raise money to bury four of their sisters who died of
botulism and are being temporarily stored in the convent freezer.
   The five real-life nuns judged most talented will each be given a
cameo role in the show for one week in February or March.
   The producers billed the audition as ``Nunsearch'' and advertised
for ``real nuns'' in Catholic and secular newspapers. They have
promised to donate $2 from every ticket sold for the special shows
to a charity chosen by the performing nun.
   ``We're constantly getting mail from nuns and priests who love
the show,'' said co-producer Ken Biller. ``We're doing it to raise
some money for charity and also of course to get publicity.''
   ``Nunsense,'' written by Dan Goggin, has played in 30 American
cities since its 1985 debut, Biller said. It's now playing in New
York and Philadelphia, is entering its third season in Boston, he
said.
   Some of the nuns who auditioned said they had dreamed of stage
careers before taking the veil.
   ``I always wanted to go to Hollywood,'' said Sister Marie
Fuhrman, 37, who works with the elderly in South Boston. ``But I
just knew I belonged in the convent.''
   ``When you get past 30, you start to say, I wish I'd done this, I
wish I'd done that,'' she said. ``Even if I don't make the part, at
least I can say I auditioned for an off-Broadway show.''
   Sister Marie, who confessed to sweaty palms, delivered a comic
monologue while her sisters and her mother superior cheered her
bravery.
   ``You see nuns on TV, they're such stereotypes of pious, holier
than thou types, and they're such stuffed shirts and prudes,'' she
said. ``We're not all that stuffy.''
   Sister Rena was a professional dancer and even owned her own
dance studio before entering the Sisters of St. Joseph convent at
age 28. Now grey-haired, she performed a jazz number to the tune of
``City Lights'' _ complete with shoulder rolls, high-kicks, and the
splits for a finale.
   Sister Brigid of the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm in
South Boston said she decided to perform her wooden spoon routine in
hopes of attracting more young women to her order.
   ``We are getting acolytes and novitiates, but not as many as we
did,'' she said, adding that she believes that nuns' participation
in a professional musical will show young women ``we're not just
behind the walls doing our work. There is joy.''

<TEXT>
   Two giant talents of the opera world, soprano
Jessye Norman and bass Samuel Ramey, electrified a Metropolitan
Opera audience, many of whom usually would be happy to stay away
from one-act operas by Bartok and Schoenberg.
   On Monday night the two Americans sang Judith and Bluebeard, in
English, in a striking, theatrical new production of Bartok's
``Bluebeard's Castle.'' And Miss Norman did the entire job _ a tour
de force _ in the Met's premiere of Schoenberg's ``Erwartung,''
which can be translated ``Expectation.''
   Both Miss Norman, of Augusta, Ga., and Ramey, of Colby, Kan.,
have big voices, with beautiful, lush tone in all parts of the
register. However much vocal control, breath, volume or musicianship
is called for, they're equal to it and there's plenty more where
that came from.
   Their characterizations _ as set by Goran Jarvefelt, a native of
Bolinas, Sweden, making his Met debut _ were right on target.
   As the curtain goes up, newlyweds Bluebeard and Judith have just
arrived at Bluebeard's dark castle. As Judith asks for the key to
one door after another, she goes from a cheery, inquisitive girl to
being imperially demanding. Bluebeard goes from pride to cringing,
knowing what's coming and dreading it.
   As Judith opens doors and takes from him parts of his past,
Bluebeard takes off parts of his garb, starting with the dark
glasses that have given his white face a skeletal look, through fur
collar, coat, cloak, shirt and finally wig.
   The remarkable set is by Hans Schavernoch, a native of Gmunden,
Austria, making his Met debut. Side walls extend inward, meeting in
a V, so that one doesn't have to sit in the center to see the walls.
One wall folds back, when Bluebeard shows Judith the world. The
other wall has the doors, through which implements of torture, a
battering ram, a big pile of gold and jewels and a tall tree appear.
   When the last door opens, revealing the three wives Bluebeard
murdered, they appear as zombies who crawl forth and walk, silently.
Bluebeard puts the cloak of death on Judith and she follows them,
moving like a queen.
   Her red gown and cloak were magnificent. Lore Haas from Vienna,
who has worked extensively with Schavernoch, also was making her Met
debut.
   When ``Bluebeard's Castle'' was performed by the Met in 1974, the
concept was nothing like this. It was almost a concert.
   James Levine conducted with deliberate care. The orchestral music
contains some chilling moments.
   Miss Norman's singing was just as remarkable in ``Erwartung.''
But it's a letdown after the other opera. It's sung in German and
the plot is impenetrable. ``The Woman'' is searching for a man in a
forest. Once she finds a corpse and puts his hand on her skin to
warm it. The next time she's at that part of the stage, the corpse
is gone. Is she crazy? Did she kill him? Is she hallucinating?
   The same design team used the other opera's backdrop, plus three
autumn trees, a park bench, flowers, candles and a grand piano. The
only thing we objected to all evening was the piano and Miss Norman
running between it and the bench. ``Erwartung'' is confusing enough.
   The Feb. 1 performance will be videotaped for showing March 31 on
PBS.

   Eight-year-old Domingos Casela was walking
through a field to his family's small corn patch and stepped on a
mine.
   Domingos and thousands like him are maimed reminders of a civil
war neither side is able to win. The conflict has gripped Angola
since independence from Portugal in 1975, causing stagnation and
desolation in one of Africa's most richly endowed nations.
   Several months after Domingos stepped on the mine, he hobbled up
a ramp at the Kuito-Bie Rehabilitation Center with a rubber-tipped
metal rod in place of his lower left leg, undergoing physical
therapy to prepare for the artificial limb he will wear the rest of
his life.
   His doctors say the mine was planted by the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA. The U.S.-supported
rebels are fighting a war of attrition against the Marxist
government of the Angolan Popular Liberation Movement, known by its
Portuguese initials MPLA.
   South Africa says it halted 13 years of aid to UNITA after
signing a U.S.-mediated accord Dec. 22 with Angola and Cuba on
withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola and independence for
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, which South Africa has
controlled since World War I.
   All South African troops in southern Angola moved back across the
border to Namibia when a truce between the two nations began Aug. 8.
   Dr. Sabino Salongue, director of the rehabilitation center in
Angola's fertile central highlands, said most of amputees being
treated were victims of mines planted by UNITA. Others lost limbs
when gangrene set in because rifle wounds were poorly tended, he
said.
   Visitors to UNITA headquarters at Jamba, in southeastern Angola
near Namibia, see amputees of the other side who stepped on mines
planted by the Cuban-supported army to impede rebel advances.
   Many victims of the war are Ovimbundu, the people of central
Huambo and Bie provinces who in 1960 were 38 percent of the 5
million living in a colony 14 times the size of Portugal.
   UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, 54, is an Ovimbundu. His father
worked for the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela, the railway on which
agricultural products and ores from Zambia and Zaire once rolled to
the Atlantic ports of Benguela and Lobito.
   Today, the Cunje railway station four miles outside Kuito is a
mass of broken bricks and shards of blue-and-white Portuguese tiles,
target of a UNITA attack.
   Grass and wildflowers grow between the rails. Five huge steam
locomotives built by Bayer, Peacock and Co. Ltd. of Manchester,
England, rust on sidings with no place to go since UNITA blew up the
bridges between Huambo and Kuito.
   Armando Ferreira, 54 years a railroader, still shows up at the
yard each day. He said people on both sides are weary of war and
eager for the railway to run again so their corn, bananas and millet
can go to market and they can receive goods from the outside.
   An international conference is scheduled for Jan. 25-26 in
Luanda, capital of Angola, to raise funds for a 10-year development
plan in the Lobito corridor, including reconstruction of the
Benguela railway. The conference is sponsored by the Southern Africa
Development Coodination Conference and the European Economic
Commission.
   The cost of re-opening the railroad has been estimated at
$300-$600 million.
   Kieran J. O'Cuneen, the Economic Commission representative in
Angola, fears potential donor nations may balk at committing
substantial funds because the war has made it impossible to conduct
a technical study in the region.
   He and others involved in development projects feel withdrawal of
Cuban troops, which began Jan. 10 and is to be finished by mid-1991,
could lead to more economic aid and development if the civil war
also ends.
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos says Angola will not negotiate
with UNITA and seeks diplomatic relations with the United States.
His government has declared a year-long amnesty to begin Feb. 4,
which spokesman Paulinho Pinto Joao says will be open to all
renounce violence and accept the constitution.
   President-elect George Bush has written Savimbi, however,
promising continued U.S. support until the government does negotiate
with UNITA.
   Covert U.S. military aid to the rebels was blocked for a decade
by a 1975 congressional amendment, but resumed in 1986 and is said
to total about $15 million annually.
   A Western diplomat said Washington's policy toward UNITA was
``outdated'' and the Marxism espoused by the ruling ruling party was
``only skin deep.''
   ``You'll see; this is not a Marxist nation,'' he said. ``Nearly
all their trade is with the West. When the Cubans have left, then
they'll get rid of the Russians.''

   Yasser Arafat's guerrillas have refrained from
attacking Israeli targets for the past two months, observing an
undeclared cease-fire that could give credibility to the PLO's peace
initiative if it endures.
   Some Israeli officials have called attention to the lack of Fatah
operations but have expressed doubt about Arafat's ability or even
desire to make it last.
   ``We have not identified any flagrant act on the part of the PLO
against the security zone or Israel since Arafat committed himself''
to end terrorism, said Uri Lubrani, a senior Defense Ministry
official responsible for Lebanon policy.
   ``I think it is too early to judge'' if the truce would be
lasting, Lubrani said on Israel radio.
   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alon Liel said in an interview it was
``not 100 percent clear'' whether the cease-fire encompassed only
Arafat's own Fatah guerrillas or all Palestine Liberation
Organization factions.
   There have been two recent infiltration attempts by Syrian-based
groups, one headed by Abu Nidal which is outside the PLO umbrella
and the other, the Palestine Liberation Front, which is part of the
PLO. Israeli soldiers killed six of the guerrillas.
   The last attack by Arafat's Fatah came on the eve of the PLO's
declaration of statehood in mid-November when a five-member Fatah
squad took U.N. soldiers and Lebanese civilians hostage for 18
hours. The guerrillas shot to death one Lebanese man before
surrendering.
   Anat Kurz, a terrorism expert at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies, said in an interview that a cease-fire
would have to be more enduring to overcome Israeli suspicion about
the PLO.
   ``It will change people's mind if it lasts longer,'' she said.
   Kurz noted Arafat had never renounced armed struggle or the right
to attack targets in Israel but said it was in Arafat's interest to
suspend anti-Israeli attacks to give his initiative credibility,
especially with Western countries.
   However, she said there were serious doubts among Israeli
policymakers about whether Fatah could tolerate a long period of
inaction without clear political gains.
   The center estimates Fatah has about 8,000 guerrillas, or half
the total number of Palestinians under arms. Most are based in
Lebanon.
   Many Israelis, especially those on the political right, view the
13-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories as a form
of terrorism aimed at destroying Israel.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Shlomo Gazit, former head of military
intelligence, said a PLO cease-fire would not be effective in
dispelling Israeli doubts unless Arafat specified its duration and
made it comprehensive.
   ``For Israelis, it doesn't matter which group stands behind an
operation. The question that counts if whether attacks continue,''
he said in an interview.
   Gazit said the test of Arafat's credibility was whether he was
willing or able to force dissident factions to observe a truce both
in cross-border raids and in violent acts in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   ``If he can't, then he is no authority we should be talking to,''
said Gazit, noting Arafat succeeded in forcing opponents to observe
a military stand in 1981 along the Israel-Lebanon border.
   The de facto truce already has touched off a public quarrel
between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the armed forces chief of
staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, who appeared to challenge Shamir's
policy by pointing out the de facto cease-fire.
   Shamir described as ``superfluous'' Shomron's report to a
parliament committee that Arafat's Fatah and other guerrillas under
his authority had ``in practice halted hostile operations'' as well
as preparations for attacks.
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, confirmed the prime minister
disagreed with chief of staff over the issue and accused Arafat of
encouraging daily acts of terror.
   ``Mr. Shamir believes there is a lot of terrorism by Arafat in
the territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip) and Israel proper,'' said
Pazner, noting a Fatah cell recently had been uncovered in northern
Israel.
   ``There are acts of terrorism daily in the territories and
attempts in Israel, and Mr. Arafat encourages those,'' he added.
   The hawkish premier has opposed any conciliatory move toward the
PLO in response to Arafat's renunciation of terrorism and acceptance
of Israel.
   Shamir told the Jerusalem Post on Friday that the PLO sought to
replace Israel and could not be trusted. ``I am sure there are those
who understand that Israel cannot trust what the PLO says. We know
them too well,'' he said.
   The daily newspaper Davar said security officials told the
Cabinet this month it was their assessment that certain PLO groups
were liable to attempt to carry out border raids but not under the
PLO's name. The purpose of such attacks would be to gauge the U.S.
response, it said.
   For Israeli doves, Arafat's declarations have been enough to
trigger calls for the government to agree to talk to the PLO. Four
members of parliament participated in a conference in Paris attended
by PLO members but avoided face-to-face talks because of a 1986
Israeli laws outlawing such contacts.
   Yossi Sarid, a dovish lawmaker who supports negotiations with the
PLO, wrote in the liberal daily Haaretz this week that Arafat's
change of principles was more difficult to achieve than a change in
policy on attacks.
   ``It's generally easier to change the pratical than the
rhetorical. For Yasser Arafat it is much easlier to stop engaging in
terror than to announce its end,'' said Sarid.

   There's something for everyone who wants a
memento of the 41st president's inauguration, ranging from a $1,200
crystal eagle for high-rollers to commemorative buttons for a buck.
   The official sales booths don't open until later this week, but
souvenir stands along the Mall already are hawking sweatshirts and
buttons with pictures of President-elect Bush and Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle.
   Tourists can get a sweatshirt for $12 or pay $5 for a
``Republican Integrity'' button with pictures of Bush and Presidents
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Reagan. Two dollars will
buy a gaudy button with Bush's and Quayle's faces atop a color photo
of the last inaugural ceremony, while smaller buttons go for $1.
   Sales have been slow thus far, according to one souvenir salesman
who said he hopes more people will be in the mood to buy trinkets as
Friday's inaugural approaches.
   People bought many more souvenirs when President Reagan took
office, another salesman said.
   ``When he was first elected eight years ago it was _ boom _ big
market,'' said the salesman, who declined to give his name. ``Now
(sales are) not even one-third of that.''
   Bush's inaugural committee hopes to rake in the cash through a
souvenir sales catalogue it mailed to 1.5 million Republicans,
historians and collectors.
   People with a lot to spend can pay $1,195 for a Steuben crystal
eagle ``depicting courage, splendor and freedom in many lands,''
according to the catalogue. A crystal ice bucket with the official
inaugural seal goes for $175.
   The catalogue also offers commemorative coins, key rings, golf
caps, umbrellas and playing cards. For $75, folks can wrap up in a
terrycloth bathrobe with the inaugural seal. Spices for Texas chili,
barbecue and gumbo sell for $2.50 each.
   T-shirts and sweatshirts celebrating the bicentennial inaugural's
``George to George'' theme _ Washington to Bush _ sell for $10 to
$44.95. And, people can pay up to $60 for a red, white and blue
inaugural auto license plate that is good until March 31.
   The inaugural committee also has contracted with Creative Photo
Crafts of Toledo, Ohio, to operate 21 sales booths along the
inaugural parade route to sell items including mittens, chocolate
bars and pennants.
   The first booth opens Tuesday, while two more open Thursday and
the rest will operate only on inaugural day.
   ``It all depends on the weather,'' said Tony Baltes, president of
Creative Photo Crafts. Four years ago, the inaugural parade was
canceled as temperatures dived toward zero.
   ``We're betting that the weather's going to be nice,'' Baltes
said.
   His company will be selling more expensive items at some of the
official inaugural events, including a $60 embroidered sweatshirt.
   The U.S. Postal Service is offering a different kind of souvenir
_ inaugural stamp cancellations from several cities, such as
Kennebunkport, Maine, and Huntington, Ind., associated with Bush and
Quayle. For $4.95, post offices across the country are selling a
Bicentennial Inaugural Memento with envelopes bearing the special
inaugural cancellations.
   Otherwise, people who don't get to come to Washington this week
must rely on the mail-order catalogue for their souvenirs.
   But Bush's honeymoon with Congress may be over by the time the
merchandise arrives _ delivery on many items is expected to take up
to 90 days.

<HEAD>DOD Audit Says Change Use Of Civilians In Combat-Essential Positions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine going off to combat only to find the
civilian technician who keeps your sophisticated weapons working
isn't interested in sticking around. The Pentagon's inspector
general is warning of such a potential problem.
   The independent inspector general, in a 24-page audit that
recently became available, says the Pentagon's procedures for
designating and staffing ``emergency-essential'' civilian jobs
overseas need to be overhauled.
   Those are jobs critical to making sure military equipment
functions at the battlefront. Many of the jobs have been described
previously as involving the maintenance of highly sophisticated
electronic and computer gear.
   ``Our audit showed that implementation of DoD's programs to
retain emergency-essential civilians did not afford a high degree of
assurance that civilian or contractor employees would continue to
perform functions and services overseas that are essential to the
support of combat forces during mobilization or hostilities,'' the
audit states.
   The people now holding the jobs ``were not informed fully of
their commitment or about their benefits,'' the audit continues.
   Moreover, of 228 civilian DoD employees who were personally
interviewed by auditors, ``28 had not volunteered to remain on the
job during crises or hostilities because of family responsibilities,
and there was no evidence of contingency plans to replace these
incumbents.''
   ``We also found that 2 of the 228 emergency-essential positions
(in this group) were occupied by persons not physically fit to serve
in a war zone.''
   On the flip side, some of the positions designated
``emergency-essential'' appear to be more ``desirable'' to have
filled than essential _ meaning those civilians might be asked to
stay in a war zone when they're really not needed, the auditors said.
   The number of people involved is relatively small, the auditors
continued. Exact totals aren't available, but it appears the Defense
Department employs about 3,700 civilians overseas in jobs designated
emergency essential, while contractors working for the military
employ several thousand more.
   Nonetheless, the military services had better address the issue
because legally, they're depending upon volunteers.
   ``Under current law, civilians cannot be required to stay on jobs
during mobilization, hostile action or an undeclared war,'' the
auditors wrote.
   ``Unless and until the Congress declares war, DoD and contractor
civilian employees may remain in, or be sent to, unsafe areas
overseas only on a voluntary basis.''
   The audit states that Defense Department civilians assigned to
emergency-essential jobs since 1985 are supposed to be volunteers
who understand that if fighting breaks out, they'll be expected to
remain at their post.
   ``And historically, DoD civilian employees and contractors have
served in hostile areas in time of need,'' the inspector general
said. ``However, there are no absolute assurances that a DoD
civilian employee or a contractor's employee would honor a
commitment to voluntarily remain on the job during hostilities.''
   The inspector general recommended the services review the
emergency-essential jobs to make sure they really are just that;
establish physical and medical standards for the positions; explain
the ``legal and administrative ramifications attendant to acceptance
of the position''; and make sure every job holder knows his
``specific wartime duties.''
   The auditors said the military should use soldiers to carry out
any function that is essential to fighting.
   Grant S. Green Jr., the assistant defense secretary for
personnel, responded to the audit by saying his office and the armed
services ``concur in your assessment and endorse the positive
recommendations.''

<HEAD>Summer's Drought Makes Self Felt In Winter For Cattle Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's already a rough winter for those cattle
producers who have to buy higher-priced hay and grain to make up for
last year's drought-ravaged pastures and feed crops, according to
Agriculture Department analysts.
   The financial bind of recent years has forced cattle producers to
cut back herds and delay new expansion plans. That has reduced beef
output sharply and sent prices to record levels at supermarket
counters.
   It will get worse before improving, the analysts say. Cattle
production prices are edging still higher, and so are consumer beef
prices _ which could threaten to make family shoppers think about
pork and chicken instead of beef.
   As of Dec. 1, according to USDA surveys, hay stockpiles
nationally totaled less than 90.9 million tons, down almost a fourth
from more than 119.8 million tons a year earlier.
   Prices of baled hay, including alfalfa and other kinds, averaged
almost $97 per ton last month, up from less than $65 in December
1987.
   Moreover, in some of the hardest-hit drought states hay
stockpiles are a fraction of their year-ago level. In North Dakota,
for example, Dec. 1 inventories were estimated at little more than
2.3 million tons, compared with nearly 5.3 million tons a year
earlier.
   Cattle production costs ``may rise modestly'' in 1989, says a
report by the department's Economic Research Service. Decisions to
open up this year's feed grains programs to a larger acreage may
ease the supply and price situation later on, but prospects will not
be firmed up before July and August.
   Meanwhile, the agency said in the January-February issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine, 1989 beef production is expected to
decline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year, the lowest level
since 1980. However, larger supplies of poultry and pork are
expected.
   That would leave this year's total meat supply at only slightly
below the 1988 record, the report said. Even so, retail beef prices
are expected to reach a record level.
   ``Rising consumer incomes and high employment rates likely will
provide continued support for meat prices,'' the report said. ``A
favorable economic environment will have to be maintained if record
retail beef prices expected in 1989 are to be met with little
consumer resistance.''
   The U.S. cattle inventory on Jan. 1, 1988, dropped below 100
million head for the first time since 1961, and the 1987 and 1988
calf crops also were the smallest since 1961.
   A new estimate on the size of the U.S. cattle herd on Jan. 1,
1989, will be issued by USDA on Feb. 8, and may show a further
decline, according to agency economists.
   The decline in 1989 beef output will be abetted by a continued
slide in the slaughter of ``non-fed'' cattle, which includes culled
cows and other animals that are sold without going through feedlots.
   ``But the biggest impact on total (beef) supplies will come from
sharply reduced fed cattle slaughter,'' the report said. ``U.S.
feedlot marketings for 1989 could decline 6 percent to 8 percent, or
about 2 million head.''
   The winding down of the placement of new animals in feedlots last
summer and fall ``may have set the stage for record prices next
spring,'' the report said. Prices for Choice steers on the Omaha,
Neb., market in 1989 could average near the mid-$70s per 100 pounds
of live weight, up from $70 last year.
   Retail beef prices rose an average of almost 5 percent in 1988,
hitting a record peak last summer when they averaged $2.59 per
pound, as measured on USDA's all-cut basis. Further increases of 1
percent to 3 percent are likely this year.
   ``The higher price of beef relative to competing meats has always
been a concern, but 1989 may test consumer demand for beef,'' the
report said.
   Per capita consumption of all meat, including poultry, averaged
220.5 pounds in 1988 but could drop back to 217.4 pounds in 1989.
Those are retail weights before home trimming, cooking and table
waste is computed.
   Beef exports in 1988 rose 8 percent to an estimated 654 million
pounds, carcass weight equivalent, the report said. And another
increases is expected this year, mainly because of larger sales to
Japan. Even so, this year's greater exports would represent only 2.8
percent of U.S. production.
   Imports of beef in 1988, meanwhile, totaled about 2.4 billion
pounds, carcass weight, up 4 percent from 1987, but may decline this
year because of smaller supplies in exporting countries, mainly
Australia and New Zealand. The imports represent less than 9 percent
of total U.S. beef consumption.

<HEAD>Ailing Soviet Teen-Ager Seeks Treatment in Phoenix</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet teen-ager unable to find a cure in her
native country for a heart condition she has had since birth arrived
Monday for treatment and a tearful welcome from relatives she had
never seen.
   Seventeen-year-old Oksana Hlebkyna received a traditional
Ukrainian greeting _ a loaf of round, wholesome bread, garnished
with a container of salt, and red and white flowers _ when she was
wheeled into the Phoenix airport terminal.
   Six youngsters clad in traditional Ukrainian garb _ white blouses
with intricate embroidery on the sleeves and dark skirts or trousers
_ sang for Miss Hlebkyna.
   ``The name of the song is `Long Live,''' said Jerry Rosola, 69,
who arrived in the United States in 1955 along with his wife,
Kateryna, the ailing young woman's great-aunt.
   Mrs. Rosola, relaying the teen-ager's thanks, said the trip to
the United States was Miss Hlebkyna's most coveted wish.
   Mrs. Rosola said surgeon Edward B. Diethrich and administrator
Theresa Gray of the Arizona Heart Institute and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., helped make arrangements.
   Heart Institute spokeswoman Paula Jennings said it wasn't
immediately known what doctors could do for Miss Hlebkyna.
   ``We are not able to state what kind of medical problem she has,
because we don't know,'' Ms. Jennings said. ``Most of the documents
we received were in Russian, and none of us here speak Russian.
Tomorrow morning, she will begin to undergo medical evaluation.''
   Miss Hlebkyna and her mother, Wladymyra Lobkowa, made the trip
from their hometown of Stryj to Moscow last week and flew to New
York on Sunday, Ms. Jennings said.
   Pan Am and Air West airlines flew the pair for free, Ms. Jennings
said.
   Doctors at the AHI ``are prepared to donate their services if
need be ... We are not making an issue of the financial
arrangements,'' said Miss Gray, the institute's director of acute
intervention and transplant services.
   She said institute officials had been told Oksana's condition was
life-threatening and was affecting her lungs.
   ``From what we understand, she has a very abnormal heart disease.
It's one that she's had since birth, and it's not feasible that she
live with it,'' Miss Gray said.
   The Rosolas left the Soviet Union almost 45 years ago, captives
of a German army. Mrs. Rosola said she did not learn until seven
years ago of her grand-niece's heart problems.
   That knowledge spurred her efforts, ever more intense, to find a
way to bring Miss Hlebkyna to America.

   For 50 cents, Charles O. ``Mutt'' Walters
will let you drive a car across his Potomac River toll bridge. For
$175,000, he'll throw in the bridge, too.
   Walters has been trying to sell the bridge for more than a year,
but so far there have been no takers.
   ``I could probably tell them all they had to know about
maintaining the bridge or who could do it,'' Walters, 69, said
recently. ``I'm retired. I don't need it.''
   The one-lane, oak-plank bridge, 12 feet wide and 360 feet long,
connects this western Maryland town of 550 people with Green Spring,
W.Va.
   Built in 1937, the bridge saves considerable time for Oldtown
residents who commute to work in Green Spring and for West
Virginians heading for Maryland. The alternative is a 40-mile
one-way trip via Cumberland, Md., or Paw Paw, W.Va.
   The span is submerged several times a year under high water, but
has survived more than 50 years of ice floes and floods.
   Bridge users drop their tolls into a tin cup bolted to a
truncated barbecue skewer, which toll takers hold out the window of
a little brick house on the Maryland shore. Cars pay 50 cents,
pedestrians a dime, motorcycles a quarter and tractor-trailers
$1.50. Motorists can use the bridge free between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
   Walters, a retired excavator and mail carrier, had done
maintenance on the bridge since 1954. In 1970, he bought it for
$53,000.
   ``If somebody wanted to run it themself, they could make a good
living,'' he said. ``I make $30,000 to $34,000 clear, and I don't do
nothing other than take the money to the bank.''

   At The Golden Bone Pet Resort, a dog's life is
nothing to bark at.
   The dog and cat resort features two-room suites with waterbeds,
standard rooms with upscale pet food, steam heat, color television
and _ a favorite among guests _ two cookie breaks daily. For $6
extra, owner David Anderson offers a hot-oil dip in fragrant flea
bath.
   Anderson opened The Golden Bone Pet Resort two months ago.
   Call it a poochie pad or a penthouse for pets, but please don't
call the resort a kennel.
   ``We don't like that word, kennel,'' Anderson said recently. ``I
think it has negative connotations.''
   The Golden Bone doesn't have the high-end market cornered.
Poochies Inc. in North Huntingdon Township about 15 miles east of
Pittsburgh offers TVs, waterbeds and even person-to-pet phone
service.
   ``We just had one woman with a cat here and she called from
Cairo, Egypt, just to make sure her cat's OK,'' said Poochies owner
Tom Wilson. The cat was held to the phone so it could hear her
master's voice.
   Room rates at Poochies and The Golden Bone range from $6 to $20 a
day, almost double the cost of one-star kennels.

   Members of Congress will receive a $45,500 pay
raise this year if lawmakers follow President Reagan's
recommendations, while a recently hired government typist would
bring home just $250 more.
   The third-ranking official in the Commerce Department or another
Cabinet agency would get a $42,500 raise, but a career federal
specialist in the food stamp program would receive an increase of
$682.
   And while a politically appointed agency bureau director would
receive a $39,500 increase, a mid-level manager in the Civil Service
system would only receive $1,263.
   The pay proposals in President Reagan's budget are noteworthy for
their disparity. There would be 50 percent increases for Congress,
top political appointees and federal judges; 16.5 percent for many
junior career executves; 3.6 percent for 2.1 million military
personnel, and just 2 percent for the 2.5 million-strong Civil
Service work force.
   In addition, Reagan has proposed a one-year freeze in
cost-of-living adjustments for military and civilian retirees.
   The 50 percent raises for 2,498 people _ lawmakers, judges and
top executive branch personnel _ would go into effect on Feb. 8
unless both houses of Congress defeat the proposal. House leaders
have indicated there will be no vote in the chamber by the deadline,
a non-action that would trigger the top raises automatically.
   Under the proposal, rank-and-file lawmakers' pay would rise to
$135,000 from the current $89,500.
   Lawmakers supporting the pay raise have said if the increase goes
through, they will give up the right to earn outside income,
including speaking fees.
   Representatives of the government's Civil Service workers are
careful not to oppose the raise for members of Congress, because
these same lawmakers must decide later whether to give federal
employees more than the 2 percent Reagan proposed. But they're not
bashful about attacking the administration.
   ``What outrages me is that the people who are responsible for
doing the work are ignored and insulted by the president,'' said
Robert M. Tobias, head of the National Treasury Employees Union,
representing 145,000 federal workers.
   ``It's the idea that some elitist group is solely responsible for
accomplishing the mission of the federal government.''
   John Sturdivant, president of the largest federal employee union,
the 700,000-member American Federation of Government Employees,
said, ``I support the 50 percent. If you listen to some of the
rhetoric and look at the folks who have come out against it, those
are the same people who will be opposing pay raises for the people I
represent.''
   ``Taking cheap shots at high-level folks is not going to do
anything for the people I represent.''
   But Sturdivant said Reagan is ``going out like he came in _
bashing federal employees in his budget proposal.''
   Joseph R. Wright Jr., director of the Office of Management and
Budget, said it is incorrect to compare the proposed 50 percent
increase at top levels with the 2 percent for civil servants.
   He said that civil servants have received steady raises each
year, and are only three to five percentage points behind inflation
since 1969.
   The salaries of top officials, he said, are down 35-40 percent
compared to inflation over the past 20 years. The administration is
trying to let them recoup their losses all at once, he said.
   ``Common sense and logic don't apply here,'' he commented. ``You
reach tough personal choices where you want to send kids to college
and cant afford to. This is the only government we've got and it
ought to be well managed. We shouldn't buy executives on the cheap.''
   James Lafferty, spokesman for the government's personnel agency,
the Office of Personnel Management, said the president's budget is
not the key to determining the Civil Service pay scales.
   More important, he said, is a government report due in August
that will compare federal pay scales to those of similar jobs in the
private sector. Based on that report, he said, OPM will make a
recommendation to the president on a pay raise.
   Civil servants are paid under the ``general schedule'' (GS)
scale, which has 18 different pay grades and 10 steps within most
grades. The lowest grade, GS 1, begins at $10,213 and the highest,
GS 18, has a single salary of $86,682. There's also a senior
executive service for government managers.
   Some lawmakers believe congressional pay is an issue that must
stand on its own. Among them is Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, chairman
of the House Education and Labor Committee, who has been the chief
congressional advocate of raising the minimum wage.
   ``We should judge the (congressional) raise on whether it would
improve the quality of representation and lead to other reforms in
ethical conduct including honoraria,'' the California Democrat said.
   ``I believe members should not have to vote on their own pay
raise. If I were required to vote on it, I would vote in favor
because I believe the responsibilities of a congressman certainly
justify more than we're now paid.
   ``If a congressman doesn't think he's worth the amount
recommended, no law says he's got to take it.''

   China's state-run airlines will buy five McDonnell
Douglas MD-11 long-range jetliners under an agreement worth $500
million, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.
   China Eastern Airlines, a subsidiary of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), will receive the first jet, a
349-set passenger model, in July next year, Xinhua said in a
dispatch from New York.
   The second plane, a cargo jet, will be delivered in December 1990
and the other three passenger aircraft will be delivered in 1992 and
1993.
   The official China Daily on Monday quoted CAAC Vice President Xu
Zhengle as saying the airlines purchased more than 200 airliners for
about $3 billion over the past three years and plans to expand
significantly over the next few years.
   The CAAC also flies Boeing, European Airbus and Soviet aircraft
on its major routes. McDonnell Douglas is now assembling its MD-82
model in Shanghai in a co-production agreement with China.

February, the French news agency Agence France-Presse reports.
   Quoting unidentified sources in the Defense Ministry, the news
agency said Monday that the French aircraft carriers Clemenceau and

in the exercise code-named Phinnia.
   The defense source told AFP the exercises have been planned since
April and have no connection to the Jan. 4 downing of two Libyan
MiG-23 jets by U.S. Navy planes in international waters off the
Libyan coast.
   The number of troops to take part in the exercise and the precise

   Commandos from France's Rapid Action Force will also participate
in the exercises, which are designed to reinforce cooperation, the
defense official was quoted as saying.

   With only a few days remaining before he
becomes vice president, Dan Quayle has given few clues about how he
will carry out his new role, in effect telling Americans to wait and
watch.
   Since the November election, the once-spotlighted Quayle has
deliberately kept a low profile while President-elect Bush remained
at center stage with personnel and policy pronouncements.
   Until the end of last week, the former Indiana senator eschewed
interviews, rebuffing reporters' attempts to learn what specific
goals or projects he has in mind for his vice presidential tenure.
His standard reply is that he wants to do Bush's bidding and become
a close adviser to the president.
   He told The Washington Post, however, in an interview published
Sunday, that he plans ``crusades'' in such areas as education,
anti-drug and crime-fighting efforts, that could include personal
visits to crime victims, drug users or school dropouts.
   Both Quayle and Bush have said they want to build an easy-access
relationship of the type Bush had with President Reagan. Bush met
privately with the president once a week and said that was generally
the opportunity he used to relay his views and advice.
   But how much Bush might rely on Quayle's advice is an open
question.
   His press secretary, David Beckwith, summed up the situation this
way: ``Quayle comes to the job with certain strengths but he also
comes to learn and to work hard. It's not like he's 65 years old and
has a wealth of experience across the board like Bush had. On the
other hand, he has a certain perspective that I think Bush values.''
   Quayle will be chairman of the National Space Council and wants
to spend several hours a week on Capitol Hill, working as an
administration advocate with his former colleagues.
   The energetic 41-year-old politician also is expected to work
with the Republican National Committee, making the rounds of the
speaker circuit, raising money and courting supporters.
   Although a favorite of conservatives, Quayle has said he does not
intend to be a mouthpiece for their interests with the more moderate
Bush. RNC spokesman Mark Goodin contended that Quayle appeals to a
Republican mainstream constituency beyond those who share his
conservative ideology.
   Goodin noted that Quayle managed to raise several million dollars
for the party through high-roller campaign events after weathering
the spate of negative publicity following his nomination.
   Quayle's focus in Congress was on national defense, as a member
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and on job issues stemming
from his co-authorship of job-training legislation.
   But Quayle spent most of the post-election period selecting his
staff and meeting privately with officials and interest groups.
   Aides reject any notion that the Bush team wanted to keep Quayle
under wraps, but say Quayle himself set the low profile during the
period when he wanted to establish his relationship with Bush.
   ``We've been sensitive to not try and handle him,'' said Bush
transition communications director Dave Demarest.
   Aides acknowledge that Quayle has an image problem stemming from
the post-Republican convention furor over his National Guard service
and poor grades in school. Opinion polls have shown that most
Americans are doubtful about Quayle's competence to assume the
presidency should anything happen to Bush.
   Quayle's image isn't helped by the jokes perpetuated not only by
late-night TV comedians, but by fellow Republicans. One was told
recently by a close associate of President Reagan.
   Bush plans to issue Quayle bonds, the joke goes. ``There's no
principle, no interest and they never mature.''
   When President Reagan first took office in 1981, he assigned Bush
to head a commission on deregulating the government. With that
commission's work mostly finished, Quayle apparently won't take on
anything similar.
   In his campaign, Bush initially said he would want his vice
president to head administration anti-drug efforts, but Quayle was
edged out of that responsibility by congressional legislation
creating a separate cabinet-level ``drug czar'' post.
   Bush last week named former Education Secretary William Bennett
to the job.

   Michael Reagan made his debut as a news
announcer for a radio station, and his dad marked the occasion with
a congratulatory phone call.
   ``Good morning, Mike. This is your old man,'' President Reagan
kiddingly told his eldest son in a call from the White House on
Monday.
   ``I'm a little far away to hear your first program but I just
wanted to congratulate you on the first day and wish you well,''
said the president, who was a radio sports announcer in Iowa in the
1930s.
   ``Well, thank you very much, dad,'' said the younger Reagan, who
was surprised and pleased by the call.
   Michael Reagan was hired by KSDO to deliver news and information
during morning rush hour. He worked for the station for a month last
summer on a temporary basis as a talk show host.
   ``The people of San Diego really liked him,'' said Mike Shields,
the station's president and general manager. ``The name Reagan has a
lot of magic in Southern California and that's because of his
father.''

   Retired NBA greats Walt Hazzard, Wali Jones, Bill
Bradley and Dave DeBusschere didn't know what they were in for when
they showed at ``The Cosby Show.'' They were enlisted by Bill Cosby
for a surprise game, and then lost to a group of women.
   The women, including Olympians Nancy Lieberman and Teresa
Edwards, defeated the men 83-80 in a taping Monday of the NBC sitcom
episode scheduled to be broadcast in March.
   Hazzard and Jones were enlisted to appear as extras in a
restaurant scene but then found out they were going to play some
basketball.
   ``Just as the tape started rolling, out of the other locker room
rolls the women's team,'' said NBC publicist Mary Neagoy. ``None of
the guys except Cosby knew they were going to play women. They were
surprised.''
   ``We did a lot more passing than the women. You appreciate
passing when you get to be over 50,'' Cosby said later.
   Lieberman was on the '84 Olympic team and Edwards won the gold in
'88. Also on the women's team were Rhonda Rompola, assistant women's
basketball coach at Southern Methodist University; college player
Anucha Sanders and Stephanie Givens, actress Robin Givens' sister.

   Actor Griffin O'Neal is due to appear in
court Friday for allegedly violating his probation by failing to
perform 400 hours of community service.
   The 25-year-old son of actor Ryan O'Neil was ordered to perform
the community service as part of his sentence for a boating accident
that killed a friend, Gian-Carlo Coppola, 23, the son of film
director and producer Francis Ford Coppola.
   O'Neal and Coppola were boating on the South River on Memorial
Day 1986 when their 14-foot runabout struck a towline connecting two
larger vessels. Coppola died of head injuries. O'Neal suffered minor
injuries.
   The two were on a break from filming ``Gardens of Stone'' in
Virginia.
   O'Neal, who was acquitted of manslaughter but convicted on a
negligent boating charge in his 1987 trial, received a 30-day
suspended jail term, 1{ years probation and was ordered to perform
400 hours of community service in California, where he lives.
   Prosecutor Gerald Anders said O'Neal had carried out ``only a
fraction'' of the community service requirement.
   He could face 30 days in jail for probation violation.

<HEAD>Now, It's Bush's Turn To Shoehorn His Priorities Into A Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan pulled a rabbit out of his hat
by bringing his proposed 1990 budget in under the Gramm-Rudman law's
deficit ceiling, but George Bush will be wrestling with a larger,
less cooperative rabbit when he prepares his own spending plan.
   Reagan accomplished the trick with a $1.15 trillion budget plan
that stuck close to his fiscal priorities of the past eight years:
domestic spending cuts and higher military expenditures.
   The new president, however, has outlined a somewhat different set
of priorities for how the government should be spending its money.
   During his election campaign, Bush spoke about expanding programs
for education, the environment, drug law enforcement, the homeless,
needy children, AIDS and federal prisons. He also set goals of
carving out tax breaks for child care, oil and gas exploration, and
college savings, among other things.
   In addition, bailouts of failed savings and loan associations
could cost as much as $100 billion over the next several years,
while cleanup and renovation of the nation's crumbling nuclear
weapons plants could cost a comparable amount in the coming years.
   All of this comes when there is very little breathing room in the
federal budget. Bush must try to submit a budget that finances the
government's operations next year without piercing the deficit
target of $100 billion set by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The spending blueprint Reagan proposed last Monday would leave an
imbalance of $92.5 billion. But because the Gramm-Rudman law does
not count $6 billion worth of proposed asset sales, the Reagan plan
officially leaves $98.6 billion in red ink.
   Can Bush squeeze his priorities in and still meet the $100
billion Gramm-Rudman target _ and keep his campaign pledge of no new
taxes? Republicans say he can, although they concede it will take a
lot of elbow grease.
   ``I won't say he should have no problems,'' Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, a member of the House Budget Committee, said Friday. ``But
it's eminently possible.''
   Under one scenario, Bush could address his campaign promises by
diverting only small amounts of money at them, saving heavier
spending for later years.
   ``I don't see a whole lot of room, and that's the bad news,''
said Peter J. Davis, a former Capitol Hill budget aide who is now a
vice president at Prudential Bache Securities in Rosslyn, Va. ``The
good news is Bush isn't asking for a whole lot.''
   Democrats, however, are convinced that Bush cannot meet the
deficit target without new taxes or harsh cuts in spending that will
enrage voters.
   They've spent the first week of this year's tax wars trying to
goad the incoming chief executive into showing how he'll do it. In
their analysis of Reagan's spending plan, Democrats on the Senate
Budget Committee called on Bush to present ``a budget that will
squarely face up to the challenges before us.''
   Congressional Democrats say Bush has a harder deficit reduction
job ahead of him than Reagan admits. The White House's Office of
Management and Budget says the deficit would be $127 billion without
any tax or spending changes at all, necessitating $27 billion in
savings to reach the target. But the Congressional Budget Office
estimated the figure at $141 billion, leaving a much larger task.
   Bush is likely to accept about $2 billion less in military
spending than Reagan proposed, leaving the Pentagon with $301
billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   But he's also considered unlikely to accept Reagan's idea of
eliminating next year's cost-of-living increase for retired federal
workers _ at a cost of $1.8 billion _ and could well decide to
ignore other spending cuts advocated by the outgoing president.
   Richard Darman, who will be Bush's budget director, has visited
congressional leaders in recent weeks, apparently providing few
details about the decisions the new administration might make.
   Bush has said he will address the issue shortly after his
inauguration Friday. As the next president likes to say, ``Stay
tuned.''

<HEAD>Study: Male Hormones Are Good For Men's Hearts</HEAD>

   Doctors have long recognized the power of
female sex hormones to keep women's hearts healthy. Now there's
evidence that abundant levels of testosterone may be good for men's
hearts.
   ``It's attractive to think that being male is good for men and
being female is good for women,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor,
a physician at the University of California, San Diego.
   Estrogen, the female hormone, is believed to one of the key
differences between the sexes that explains why women typically live
seven to eight years longer than men.
   Barrett-Connor presented evidence Monday that men with high
levels of testosterone, the male hormone, are in better shape than
those with relatively low levels. Whether this means they are more
likely to escape heart attacks is still unclear.
   Her work, presented Monday at a meeting of the American Heart
Association, is based on a followup of 5,000 California residents
who were first examined in 1972.
   She found that men with high testosterone also have higher levels
of high density lipoprotein, or HDL, the so-called good cholesterol
that protects people from heart attacks. They also have lower blood
pressure and are less likely to be overweight.
   ``In other words, testosterone is good for men,'' she said.
   However, despite these attributes that would seem to lower the
risk of heart disease, there was no clear evidence that the men with
higher testosterone actually lived longer. Barrett-Connor noted that
the body's levels of sex hormones fluctuate throughout the day. And
since her research was based on just one blood sample, it might not
have accurately identified differences between the men's hormone
levels.
   She also noted that even if testosterone turns out to be good for
men's hearts, she does not advocate taking extra doses of the
hormone.
   She said another major study has begun to see what effect
estrogen pills have on women's risk of heart attacks after they go
through menopause, when their bodies' natural production of the
chemical drops sharply.
   Some of the women will take estrogen alone, while others will get
a combination of estrogen and progestin. Estrogen by itself can
increase the risk of uterine cancer. But while the estrogen and
progestin combination eliminates this hazard, some doctors fear that
the extra progestin wipes out estrogen's benefits for the heart.
   Among other research presented Monday:
   _Dr. Redford B. Williams Jr. of Duke University said that anger,
not impatience, is the key element of Type A behavior that raises
the risk of heart disease. He said that those with a heart
attack-prone personality are more likely to get angry, to become
suspicious of other people's motives and to show their hostility
toward others.
   _According to Dr. Wayne J. Katon of the University of Washington,
panic attacks and depression are frequently mistaken for heart
disease, especially among young and middle-aged women. During panic
attacks, people may gasp for breath, grow dizzy, tremble, feel chest
pain and believe they are going to die.
   _Strokes occur in two or three of every 100,000 children. Dr.
Dorothy M. Aram of Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in
Cleveland has found that when the stroke is limited to one side of
the brain, these youngsters grow to have normal intelligence.
However, they may have varying degrees of other problems, including
physical weakness on one side and trouble reading and talking.
   _Dr. Louis R. Caplan of New England Medical Center in Boston
reported that cocaine use is becoming a major cause of strokes in
young adults. Studies at one hospital found it to be the single
greatest cause of strokes in those under age 40.

   A disputed Libyan plant at Rabta proves the
difficulty of enforcing a treaty banning chemical weapons, say a
number of national security experts.
   A conference of 149 nations, meeting last week in Paris, endorsed
a U.S. proposal to reaffirm a 1925 Geneva protocol against the use
and spread of chemical weapons.
   That declaration will not ban chemical weapons, but was expected
to give new impetus to long-stalled negotiations in Geneva on a
proposal put forward in 1984 by Vice President George Bush for
banning chemical weapons outright and requiring those nations that
have them to destroy their stockpiles.
   Bush, who succeeds President Reagan on Friday, has expressed a
wish to be remembered as the president under whom chemical weapons
are eliminated.
   Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, Reagan's national security adviser, is
among those who say it would be hard to verify compliance with a ban
on their production, and even harder to verify their total
destruction.
   ``The problem we have is that nobody has yet determined how to do
it in an effectively verifiable way, because chemical weapons can be
made in just about any kind of chemical plant,'' Powell said in a
interview broadcast over the weekend on the syndicated television
program, ``John McLaughlin's One on One.''
   ``And you can turn it back into an aspirin plant or a fertilizer
plant with a few hours notice,'' Powell said. ``It's very
troubling.''
   The Paris conference gained publicity and momentum because of
U.S. charges that Libya was building a chemical weapons plant at
Rabta, 35 miles from Tripoli. Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
says the plant would make pharmaceuticals.
   Two former U.S. diplomats with long experience in chemical
weapons negotiations, Charles Floweree and James Leonard, recently
disputed Powell's pessimistic view, arguing that any factory large
enough to make a significant amount of chemical weapons could be
detected by American intelligence.
   ``Clandestine manufacture is difficult to imagine,'' said
Floweree, who in 1977-79 directed the international relations
division of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   Frank Gaffney, deputy assistant secretary of defense in the first
Reagan administration, said the dispute over the Libyan plant
illustrates the problems of verifying a ban on chemical weapons.
   ``While the Libyan plant is a dedicated chemical weapon facility,
Gadhafi's protestations that it is a pharmaceutical complex nicely
illustrates the problem: essentially any facility that actually is
meant for production of civilian chemical products ... has the
inherent ability to produce toxic chemical agents for weapons.''
   Although about 15 countries are thought to have chemicals
weapons, only two nations acknowledge it, the United States and the
Soviet Union. Additionally, the United Nations concluded in 1984
that Iraq used chemical weapons in its war against Iran.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has announced that
his nation would begin destroying stockpiles of chemical weapons,
which he and other Soviet officials have said since Dec. 26, 1987,
totalled 50,000 tons.
   But on Dec. 2, 1988, the Reagan administration challenged those
figures. Although U.S. officials have not disclosed their own
estimates, outside experts have cited figures as high as 300,000.
   The United States did not produce chemical weapons from 1969
until 1987, when the Army, with the approval of Congress, began to
manufacture binary weapons, which become lethal when two otherwise
nontoxic chemicals are combined, forming a lethal charge.
   The Army is destroying its stocks of old single-substance
chemical weapons, and although the U.S. officials have not disclosed
the extent of the stockpile, outside experts estimate it to be about
30,000 tons of chemical agents. The chemicals, plus the artillery
shells to deliver them, would weigh several times more.
   Besides the United States and the Soviet Union, more than a dozen
other nations are thought to have chemical weapons, said Elisa
Harris, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who carefully tracks
the issue.
   Those nations able to make their own chemical weapons are thought
to be Iraq, Burma, China, Israel, Libya, North Korea, Syria, China,
Iran, Israel, Taiwan, Vietnam, and probably Egypt, which is thought
to have used the weapons in its war against Yemen, said Harris.
Ethiopia is also thought to have chemical weapons, she said.
   Ethiopia and a number of other Soviet-bloc nations are thought to
have acquired chemical weapons at some point from Moscow, although
that practice appears to have ended, she said.

<HEAD>Bush Presidency Brings New Wave Of Texans To Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is bringing a tidal wave of Texans
with him to the capital city, and they promise to make their way of
doing things felt on the social as well as political scene.
   In addition to a Texas president _ albeit a transplanted Yankee _
a Texas speaker of the House, appointees from defense
secretary-designate to FBI director, and four committee chairmen in
Congress, Washington will have to reckon with their families.
   ``Batten down the hatches,'' warns The Washington Post on
Sunday's front page. ``Nervy, sexy, filthy rich Georgette Mosbacher,
wife of the incoming commerce secretary and a certified social
cyclone, is headed our way.''
   But Mrs. Mosbacher, wife of Houston oilman Robert Mosbacher,
isn't the only sign that Texas has arrived.
   ``You'll see more boots than you've seen. You'll see more hats
than you've seen,'' says Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm. ``And if
the emergence of Texans into positions of power brings good Mexican
food to the capital, the achievement will be miraculous.''
   ``The quality of the barbecue is going to pick up, the quality of
the Mexican food is going to pick up,'' says Rep. Charlie Stenholm,
a Democrat and Texas farmer. ``The social scene is going to pick up
and we'll have a little high culture; the cotton-eyed Joe and the
two-step are going to be right at the top of the list.''
   A.C. Greene, director of the Center for Texas Studies at the
University of North Texas in Denton, that despite the influx, the
days of the wheeler-dealer, swashbuckling Texas politicans are gone.
   Greene says he's not convinced Bush and his coterie of
nationalized Texans will wield the same sort of behind-the-scenes
clout as Lyndon B. Johnson did as Senate majority leader, vice
president and president; as Sam Rayburn did when he was House
Speaker; and John Nance Garner did as Frankin D. Roosevelt's vice
president.
   If any Texan has real connections, Greene says it's House Speaker
Jim Wright of Fort Worth, who has ``has fought those battles in the
corridors of power,'' and may actually be more influential in
Washington than Bush, at least for now.
   LBJ's inaugural chairman 24 years ago, Dale Miller, isn't
expecting any Texas invasion at all, he says, because the state has
always had a presence in Washington in the 47 years he's been in
here.
   ``There's always been a pronounced Texas influence here in
town,'' Miller says. ``I've known a very strong Texas influence in
Washington for 47 years.''
   But others are expecting a flock of Texans who will leave a
Texas-size style imprint on the government.
   ``Texans are really going to be here in a big way. Texas will
have a big part to play,'' says veteran journalist Sarah McClendon,
who predicts less ``gobbledygook'' in government publications
because of the Texas preference for simple and direct language.
   Gramm says he thinks the four Cabinet appointments and other
high-profile jobs already awarded to Texans are just the tip of the
iceberg. ``There will be literally hundreds of Texans in
decision-making positions. People tend to hire people they know and
people they trust.''
   But Greene says: ``A lot of these are cosmetic positions,
especially the appointed positions. Bush doesn't have the
connections LBJ did, and there is just no substitute for on-the-Hill
politics in Washington.''
   Still, Gramm says it's a ``plus for Texas and America.''
   ``I know all of these Texans care about our state and those who
are not Texans know the guy at the top cares about Texas and that's
obviously going to help,'' Gramm says.

<HEAD>Five States Would Get More Than $1.25 Billion In Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon wants to spend more in West
Germany than in any one of the United States except California on
military construction projects in fiscal 1990.
   Altogether, the Pentagon wants to spend almost $8.6 billion on
such construction projects in fiscal 1990, with just five states
accounting for almost $1.25 billion in work.
   More than $1 billion would be spend on projects outside the
United States, with almost one-third of that _ $316.1 million _
going for projects in West Germany.
   If President-elect Bush and Congress go along, the big winners
domestically will be California, with $486.5 million in proposed
spending; Texas, with $238.8 million; Florida, with $194.2 million;
New York, with $151 million, and Virginia, with $141.7 million.
   Overseas, work in England would total $114.7 million. Projects in
Italy would cost $98.8 million; those in the Philippines, $98.2
million, and those in South Korea, $89.2 million. Across Europe,
some $557.9 million would be spent on so-called NATO Infrastructure
projects.
   Among the largest single proposals in the United States are
$111.3 million for facilities to support the MX missile at F.E.
Warren Air Force Base, Wyo.; $100.5 million in new facilities at
Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., to support the B-2 stealth bomber; $89
million for a ``solid rocket motor assembly facility'' at the Cape
Canaveral, Fla., Air Force Station; $70.6 million in work at Fort
Drum, N.Y., the new home of an Army light infantry division; $58.9
million for various facilities at the new Kings Bay Naval Submarine
Base in Georgia; and $24 million to expand the Bancroft Hall
dormitory at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.
   Also sought for overseas work are $17.5 million to upgrade
facilities, primarily air fields, in Honduras, where U.S. forces
regularly exercise as part of an administration campaign to deter
Nicaraguan adventurism; $25.8 million to improve air fields and
build warehouses in Oman near the Persian Gulf; and $11.9 million
for continued improvements at the missile range complex in the
Kwajalein Islands in the Pacific to help support Star Wars
experiments.
   The military construction request is a small part of the Defense
Department's $315.2 billion spending plan for fiscal 1990 which
President Reagan proposed last week. That compares with authorized
spending of $298.8 billion this year.
   Of the $8.6 billion total for fiscal 1990, the Pentagon said it
would spend almost $5.3 billion on military facilities and about
$3.3 billion on family housing, both on-base and off-base. By
contrast, the Defense Department plans to spend $9 billion on
construction this year, including $5.7 billion on military
facilities and $3.3 billion on housing.

   Crowds burned cars and a store, looted and threw
rocks at officers in a black neighborhood Monday after police shot
at black suspects during a chase that ended with one man dead and
another injured.
   About 125 police officers in riot gear closed off an area about
17 blocks by nine blocks in the impoverished Overtown neighborhood
just north of downtown, which has been the site of major racial
strife in the past.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez declared the riot ``contained'' about
five hours later. But late Monday, there was still sporadic gunfire
and looting, according to television reports. School officials
announced five schools in the area would be closed Tuesday.
   City Manager Cesar Odio said prominent black community leaders
had been called to walk the streets Monday night seeking calm.
   Several officers and bystanders were hit by rocks and bottles,
police said. At least two cars were set afire and two news vehicles
attacked with rocks, authorities said. An auto parts store burned
after firefighters were shot at and had to leave the area, police
said.
   Four people, including one police officer, were treated for
lacerations and minor injuries at Jackson Memorial Hospital, and
released, said spokesman Tony Fallon. Other officers were treated at
the scene, police said.
   ``All of a sudden they threw a big huge rock right on the side of
the driver. I blocked it with my elbow. They were yelling `Get that
white woman out of the car,''' said Lourdes Ruiz-Toledo, a
27-year-old WCIX-TV reporter.
   Miss Ruiz-Toledo, who had stayed in her car while an anchorman
and camerman got out, said she drove a block away and was rescued by
an officer who led her from the car behind a plastic riot shield.
   A waitress said her windshield was shattered by a five-pound
concrete block when she drove through the area on her way home from
work.
   ``I had no idea it was going on,'' said Kay Worthington of Miami
Beach. ``There were about 20 kids all throwing things. I was worried
that I was going to be hurt. I didn't see any cops around there.''
   Later Monday, Miami police were placed on full alert, with
overnight shifts called in early, and the Florida Highway Patrol and
Metro police placed on standby.
   The incident began about 5:45 p.m. on the Martin Luther King
holiday when police started chasing a motorcycle with two possible
robbery suspects, said Sgt. Michael Mazur.
   Police started shooting, and the motorcycle ran into a car, Mazur
said.
   The driver of the motorcycle died at the scene, said police Chief
Perry Anderson, who wouldn't say whether the cause was the crash or
police gunfire. A motorcycle passenger was hospitalized, along with
others in the vehicle involved in the wreck, police said, without
giving identities.
   The 21-year-old dead suspect and his passenger were both black
men, said police, who refused to divulge the race of the officers
involved in the chase.
   A crowd of about 50 to 75 people gathered at the accident scene
in the Overtown section and started throwing rocks and bottles,
Mazur said. By several hours later, he said, the situation had
become ``very volatile'' and a riot control plan was put into effect.
   ``I obviously can assure you we will have a full investigation,''
Suarez said. ``I don't think there's ever been a situatuion where
quicker action has been taken by city governance.''
   During three days of rioting in the Overtown section in 1982,
arsonists torched buildings and mobs broke into stores, causing
millions of dollars worth of damage. The riot was sparked by the
fatal shooting of a black man by a Cuban-born police officer. A
police internal affairs report in 1985 concluded that the officer
was justified in using deadly force.
   In 1980, racial violence in adjacent Liberty City left 18 people
dead, 400 injured and $100 million in damage. That rioting occurred
after an all-white jury acquitted several Miami-Dade police officers
of manslaughter in the beating death of a black businessman.
   The latest incident comes as Miami is trying to polish its image
for an influx of visitors for the Super Bowl on Sunday. The scene of
the disturbance was at least 10 miles from Joe Robbie Stadium in
north Dade County, the site of the Super Bowl. But the Cincinnati
Bengals are staying less than a mile away at the Omni Hotel.
   The Miami Arena, where the Miami Heat of the National Basketball
Association has a game scheduled Tuesday, is on the edge of Overtown.

<TEXT>
   An air historian says he has unearthed evidence
suggesting U.S. aviator Amelia Earhart ran out of fuel and crashed
about 30 miles short of a Pacific island on her round-the-world
flight a half-century ago.
   Roy Nesbit, a former British air force navigator, said Monday he
discovered a letter Earhart wrote to Britain's aviation authority
saying she intended to carry 1,000 gallons of fuel aboard her
Lockheed Electra on the flight over the Pacific, some of which
crossed over British Commonwealth territory.
   He said Earhart's navigator, Fred Noonan, also was reported by
The Daily Telegraph of Sydney, Australia, as saying the twin-engine
plane would be loaded with 950 gallons for the flight from Lae, New
Guinea, to Howland Island, a speck of land in the central Pacific.
   The record-setting pilot never arrived on Howland Island,
disappearing near the end of a 2,550-mile flight over water on July
2, 1937.
   No trace of the plane or its pilot and navigator were found, and
theories about their fate have since abounded, including one that
Earhart landed on another island, was imprisoned by the Japanese and
was executed as a spy.
   ``With 950 gallons, they could have made it, just,'' Nesbit, 67,
said in a telephone interview. ``But, unfortunately, she experienced
relatively strong head winds on the flight and her safety margin
evaporated. So she must have come down in the sea.''
   Nesbit, whose research was published in the February edition of
Aeroplane Monthly magazine, calculated that Earhart was flying about
35 miles west or northwest of Howland Island when her last, frantic
message that she was about to crash was received by the U.S. coast
guard cutter, Itasca, 20 hours and 20 minutes after takeoff.
   ``It is evident she must have come down in the sea a few minutes
later, when she believed she was nowhere near Howland Island,''
Nesbit wrote.
   Nesbit says other researchers have suggested Earhart landed on
the Japanese-controlled Mili Atoll 23 hours and 10 minutes after
takeoff, having turned back after failing to find Howland Island.
   ``This suggests the flight duration was the maximum possible if
the Electra had been fueled to capacity,'' he wrote.
   The aircraft, converted from a Lockheed airliner, had a fuel
capacity of 1,150 gallons, he said, but in a Feb. 13, 1937, letter
to the director of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, Earhart wrote
that she intended to carry ``probably 1,000 gallons of gasoline'' on
her longest flight over the Pacific.
   Nesbit said he found the original letter written by Earhart on
her headed notepaper and bearing her signature in London's Public
Record Office.
   He said that according to fuel consumption figures supplied to
him by Lockheed, 950 gallons would have given the twin-engine plane
an endurance of 20 hours and 13 minutes.
   In her final message, Earhart said she was flying north and south
on a line but did not give a reference point.
   ``This sounds as though Amelia was chasing shadows on the surface
of the sea, formed by the cumulus clouds above, or was flying toward
more distant clouds in the hope that these were the smoke which the
Itasca was making,'' Nesbit wrote.
   He dismissed the notion that she was on a mission to photograph
the Japanese-held island of Truk, saying she would have crossed it
at night, and night-photography equipment had not yet been perfected.
   He also wrote that contrary to the belief at the time that her
plane would float, the metal aircraft was likely to have sunk
immediately.

<HEAD>Stuttering Linked To Brain Flaws By High-Tech Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Stuttering, once thought to be
psychological, has been linked to brain abnormalities by scientists
who hope to understand many disorders by making 3-D videotapes of
the brain in action.
   Subtle irregularities in electrical activity and blood flow were
found in brains of 60 percent of stutterers, whose speech is broken
by abnormal pauses, repetitions (st-st-stuttering) or prolongations
(ssssstuttering) of sounds, said audiologist Terese Finitzo, who
directed the University of Texas studies.
   She said similar brain abnormalities were detected in 84 percent
of people with spasmodic dysphonia, in which malfunctioning vocal
cords produce a hoarse, strained, strangled-sounding voice.
   The Dallas scientists studied 20 stutterers and 77 people with
spasmodic dysphonia by examining magnetic resonance imaging pictures
of brain anatomy. Unlike CAT scans, which use X-rays, the technique
uses a giant magnet and radio waves to make pictures of organs.
   The scientists also made maps of brain electrical activity as
measured by electrodes on the head; and images of brain blood flow.
   But they also developed a way to process the two-dimensional maps
of brain electrical activity to pinpoint the location of that
activity.
   That let them superimpose the brain anatomy and electrical
activity images, then string them together on videotape to make ``an
animated movie or cartoon, so as electrical activity progresses you
can see it moving through the brain'' in three dimensions, said Dr.
Kenneth Pool, a neurologist in the Texas group. Blood-flow images
will be added later.
   Such technology might help scientists understand how the brain
works, and perhaps eventually how to better diagnose and treat
speech defects, mental illness, epilepsy, dyslexia, Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's diseases, post-stroke speech loss and other disorders,
Pool said.
   The technique ``is expected to radically alter (brain) disease
evaluation and management for neurologists, psychiatrists and
neurosurgeons,'' said a news release from the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association.
   Scientists have long believed that the speech impediments were
psychological. But in recent years, many have linked the impediments
to brain malfunctions that can be aggravated by psychological stress.
   That view is supported by findings of the government-funded, $2
million Texas research outlined by Finitzo, Pool and colleagues
Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   The studies also suggest the speech defects have many causes,
because not all the patients had brain abnormalities, Pool said.
   About 1 percent of Americans stutter to some degree. Spasmodic
dysphonia is uncommon, although there are no reliable estimates,
Finitzo said.
   Stutterers and people with spasmodic dysphonia often receive
speech therapy to learn to slow down, breathe differently or
otherwise alter their speaking habits, but for many ``the benefits
are minimal,'' Pool said.
   He said patients are relieved when told their stuttering or
spasmodic dysphonia is physical.
   ``We've had people say, `Thank God it's not my fault.' They don't
have to feel responsible for it, (even) if everybody's telling them,
`If you just relax you can speak better,''' he said.
   Arnold E. Aronson, head of speech pathology at the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota, said there are several forms of the speech defects and
that people whose stuttering is psychological may get improper
treatment if they believe otherwise.
   Aronson questioned the reliability of the Texas team's methods,
saying they were biased by preconceptions and studied too few
patients. He also accused them of making conclusions ``far beyond
what the facts imply'' and of failing to conduct adequate
psychiatric exams of their patients.
   But he did say ``there is great merit in what they are doing.''
   Louisiana State University speech scientist Ray Daniloff agreed
more people should be studied, but said he reviewed much of the
Texas research for the government and concluded ``the data are good.
... The methodology is sound.''
   ``I think it's good work,'' said University of Connecticut speech
scientist Peter J. Alfonso. ``They are probably the only people in
the world using a combination of new brain-imaging techniques to
investigate stuttering.''
   Pool and Aronson agreed the brain abnormalities aren't
necessarily the direct cause of stuttering and spasmodic dysphonia,
and that the abnormalities and speech defects could result from some
other ultimate cause.
   But because the abnormalities are in parts of the brain believed
to control speech, the Texans believe the abnormalities cause the
impediments _ even if they ultimately might be caused by a chemical
flaw in the brain, a gene, injury, tiny strokes or even pollutants,
Pool said.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges In Japan; Stocks Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen Tuesday,
while investors reacted to the weaker yen by pushing share prices
lower on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar eased in the afternoon to close at 127.70 yen, up 1.05
yen from Friday's close of 126.65 yen, after opening at 127.93 yen
and surging to peak at 128.15 yen in early morning trading.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues dipped 70.86 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at
31,227.52.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama attributed the dollar's strength
to the difference in key interest rates between Japan and the United
States, and to reported statements by West German monetary
authorities that the dollar's current level is acceptable.
   Murayama said the Bank of Japan will not intervene to stem the
dollar's rise because ``the situation does not require imediate
countermeasures.''
   Currency traders said the dollar's remarkable strength against
the yen followed the U.S. currency's bullish advance in overseas
markets overnight. The dollar closed Monday in London at 128.05 yen
and in New York at 128.10 yen.
   Traders said the dollar also was strong because of reduced
chances for central bank intervention in the United States and Japan
due to national holidays.
   Many U.S. traders were absent from the market Monday in
observance of Rev. Martin Luther King's birthday, while Japanese
banks and government offices were also closed Monday in observance
of the Coming of Age Day.
   ``There were strong demands for buying the dollar, but traders'
fear over intervention prevented such a move,'' said a dealer at a
major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Then
when they were freed from such a fear, they all went out to buy the
dollar.''
   But the traders added that the dollar's gain is unlikely to
continue ahead of U.S. trade reports due Wednesday in Washington.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dealers said the dollar's steep gain
sidelined many investors.
   ``The market seems to be taking a break (Tuesday) because of
unstable currency rates,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage house
in Tokyo. ``But the underflow of the market is still bullish.''

   A man whose wife was killed and daughter
injured in a mudslide that left their car dangling on the edge of a
100-foot cliff said he was ``just driving along and the whole
mountain came down on top of us.''
   Michael Edwards, 27, who suffered minor injuries in Sunday's
accident, said the family was on a logging road and looking at snow
when their car was crushed by a 20-foot boulder freed by the
mudslide.
   ``It happened so quick,'' he said.
   The impact of the boulder trapped the car on the steep, muddy
hillside above the rain-swollen Coos River. Edwards was freed
shortly after the accident. His wife, Vera Anne Edwards, 24, was
pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said.
   Rescuers spent seven hours working to free the Edwards'
6-year-old daughter, Tasha.
   They used rocks and an air bag to brace other boulders, and
firefighters with safety ropes and life jackets hung over the
cliff's edge to work on the car with hydraulic equipment, said
firefighter Shannon Brownlee.
   ``When we got there, all we could see was her (Tasha's) face,''
he said. ``That's how bad it was.
   ``The situation was if you cut one thing and pried it up, you
couldn't see where the rest of the body was.''
   Michael Brown, a medic with Bay Cities Ambulance, was able to
crawl inside the car with the girl, but could do little more than
treat a gash on her head, talk to her and administer oxygen.
   ``She was pretty scared,'' Brown said. ``There were times she
said she hurt all over. And other times she said she felt nothing
all over.''
   ``She'd say, `I want my Dad or I'm going to scream, and I said,
`If you're going to scream, I'll scream too.' That quieted her
down,'' Brown said.
   The girl rarely mentioned her mother, who lay dead in the car
with her, Brown said. Her father was able to get within 10 feet of
the car and yell encouragement, Brown added.
   The child was listed in fair condition Monday at Bay Area
Hospital, where she underwent surgery for a broken leg.
   ``It's almost impossible to believe anybody survived,'' said
sheriff's deputy Richard Nicholaus.

   Edward Zarnow Jr. came from Australia to plan
his father's funeral. Now other relatives must plan funerals for the
son and two other family members who authorities say died from fumes
from the same faulty furnace.
   ``It was a tremendous and gross loss of lives,'' Milwaukee County
Medical Examiner Jeffrey Jentzen said Monday. ``I think it makes
everyone humble to see this type of disaster happen.''
   After the 89-year-old Zarnow died Wednesday, autopsy results
revealed extensive heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver. The
death was attributed to natural causes, and no toxicological exams
were believed necessary, Jentzen said.
   ``There's not a medical examiner's office in this country that
would have handled this case any differently,'' he said.
   As relatives gathered for the funeral, they stayed at his
suburban Greendale home.
   Sunday morning, his niece, Audrey Brennan, called police when she
telephoned the home and got no answer. An officer knocked on the
door but got no response.
   Hours later, Mrs. Brennan called police back to say she had found
the three bodies in the house.
   ``My wife could have been there, too,'' her husband, Frank, said
Monday evening from their Milwaukee home. ``She was supposed to pick
them up. Then the others said they would do it. They were going to
pick them up at the airport and then stay at the house.''
   Jentzen confirmed Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning killed
Edward Zarnow Jr., 57, of New South Wales, Australia; Zarnow Jr.'s
37-year-old niece, Karen S. Martin of Marshfield and her husband
Michael, 38.
   Zarnow Jr.'s wife, Rebecca, 56, was in critical condition Monday
night after treatment in a hyperbaric chamber, according to a
nursing supervisor at St. Luke's Hospital.
   Jentzen said further tests on the elder Zarnow's body showed he
too died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
   ``This was a very rare and unusual case because of the
circumstances and the loss of lives,'' Jentzen said.
   After the bodies were discovered, investigators found the gas
furnace's regulator was not properly adjusted, causing too much gas
to go into the furnace, Wisconsin Natural Gas Co. spokesman Paul
Markovina said.
   The overburning caused incomplete combustion that filled the
house with carbon monoxide, a colorless, oderless and lethal gas, he
said.
   The coroner's report said five burners in the furnace were
clogged, causing improper burning, although Brennan said the unit
had annual inspections.
   Brennan also said the senior Zarnow was a machinist and worked as
a supervisor at a factory before he retired.
   The home was built as part of the original Greendale development,
part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Green Belt program of the 1930s,
Brennan said.
   Edward Zarnow III, a resident of Orange, Australia, said his
father was an elementary school teacher but had retired last month
and hoped to spend time golfing, woodworking and traveling.
   He said his father, who grew up in the house where he died, moved
to Australia in 1971 with his wife and four children, and they
became citizens of that country.
   ``At the time, Australia was bringing teachers over ... and my
father was looking at a new place to teach, and he thought it would
be a good change, so we came across,'' Zarnow, 29, said from
Australia.
   Brennan said seven relatives planned to arrive today from
Australia.
   ``This is so stupefying on the surface,'' he said. ``Thankfully,
there's been so much activity (at his home) that it's distracted my
wife.''
   Friends had stopped by, bringing food for the family and
``talking about other things,'' he said. ``It helps keep the ball
rolling.''

<TEXT>
   The Western Shoshone Indians have vowed to
press their claim to full grazing rights on a half-million acres of
land despite an appeals court ruling limiting the number of horses
and cows they can have.
   ``This isn't the end to litigation. We don't consider this issue
resolved,'' said Thomas E. Leubben, attorney for the Western
Shoshone National Council. ``Only Congress can resolve the Western
Shoshone land issue.''
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday reversed U.S.
District Judge Bruce Thompson's September 1986 order that gave
sisters Mary and Carrie Dann, members of the Shoshone tribe, the
right to graze cattle and horses at their 180-acre ranch in
north-central Nevada's Crescent Valley.
   Thompson had ruled the Danns had aboriginal and treaty rights to
graze their livestock on 530,000 acres without being regulated by
federal agencies or paying grazing fees.
   The appellate ruling limits the Danns to grazing 26 cows and 79
horses, the number their parents had on the land when the 1934
Taylor Grazing Act took effect. The sisters currently have 768 cows
and 850 horses.
   A tearful Carrie Dann said at a news conference Monday she has no
plans to reduce the herd.
   ``I'm not really afraid of going to jail because I believe I'm
right,'' she said.
   The U.S. government sued the Danns for trespassing in 1974 to
prevent them from using the land for grazing. The 14-year-old case
has been argued three times in federal court in Reno, twice in the
appeals court and once before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The sisters claim that an 1863 treaty with the United States
gives them the right to use the land for grazing.
   The government contends that the Western Shoshone lost its
ancestral land in 1979 when the Indian Claims Commission awarded the
tribe $26 million for the acreage. The Indians have refused to
accept the money.
   ``This land was never given by the United States to us. It is the
Creator's land,'' Carrie Dann said Monday.
   ``The Creator put us on this land,'' she said. We were not placed
here by the United States government. Our livelihood is tied to this
land. They wanted to do away with our livelihood. They're trying to
destroy our beliefs, our culture.''
   Luebben, of Albuquerque, N.M., said he would continue to argue
the case in federal court, but added he would try other avenues.
   ``Considering this decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
the Shoshone people are going to have to appeal to the public and to
Congress,'' Luebben said.
   ``We consider this decision to be wrong and extremely unjust,''
he said. ``There is still institutional racism in the United
States.''

   For a group of former U.S. Marines, a return

had never seen before. AP Special Correspondent George Esper, on his
second reporting trip to Vietnam since the war ended, accompanied

   Five former U.S. Marines stood at what
was their military base two decades ago. Surrounded by unexploded
shells, they unfurled the stars and stripes and prayed and wept for
their fallen comrades.
   While Mike Wallace, a 41-year-old farmer from Langdon, Kansas,
prayed for help to ``deal with the memories, the pain and the
loneliness,'' poor women and children with hoes hacked away at the
reddish dirt, trying to uncover the casings of shells for scrap
metal.
   They said that two weeks ago an old man was killed when an
uncovered shell exploded, and that such shells had killed many
others, including children.
   A Vietnamese captain, Hoang Van Thanh, stood with the Americans
at the ceremony just south of what was once the Demilitarized Zone
that divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel. He verified that mines
and other unexploded artillery and mortar shells were still killing
and wounding civilians.
   The former U.S. Marines had suspected that civilians were still
being killed and wounded by unexploded shells and land mines that
their engineer battalion, the 11th Marines, planted to protect a
string of U.S. bases just below the DMZ in the late 1960s.
   The men, who came back to check claims by Vietnamese officials
that all of the mines had been cleared, were shocked to see the
children picking at the shellings at the former U.S. artillery base
at Gio Linh.
   ``I feel outrage,'' said Nate Genna, a 41-year-old maintenance
worker from Boston as he looked out over the children. ``This whole
place should be quarantined, fenced up; only professional people,
not children. Look at them.''
   Wallace said: ``My legs are walking but my mind is not wanting to
do this because for so long I spent time in this place watching
people get killed.''
   ``It's peaceful, but I'm real nervous,'' he said. ``I've got to
admit I could hardly get out of the van to come up here. I'm scared
to death, the time I was here we was under attack and that's the
only memories I have of here.
   ``Even though it's in peace, its still looks awfully threatening
to me.''
   In the salute to the dead, Gene Spanos, a 39-year-old police
lieutenant from Rosemont, Ill., said, ``On behalf of the men that
lost their lives and women in Vietnam during the conflict, we
present this small ceremony, some token of appreciation in the lives
that they gave. For those who did not return, eternal rest. For
those who did return, gratitude and peace.''
   Everywhere the former marines went, they were greeted warmly as
they retraced their steps northward along Highway 1 where they once
swept the road for land mines.
   Children followed them along the route and the Americans stopped
to snap photos.
   ``This is the first time I've felt we're performing our mission
since I've been here,'' said William Johnson, 41, of Manchester,
Conn. ``This is for the people.''
   ``This is where it all began,'' said fireman Frank Noe, 40, from
Stoughton, Mass. ``This is where we grew up. This is where we became
men 20 years ago.''

   U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F.
Cavazos said minority students are getting an inferior education
because of a lack of minority teachers.
   Cavazos on Monday called the shortage a matter of ``true
urgency,'' pointing out that 30 percent of the nation's students are
minorities, while only 13 percent of the educators are.
   ``Today, the person that takes roll ... and assigns work ... is
usually an Anglo teacher, doing the best he can do,'' Cavazos said
in the keynote address to the National Conference on Recruitment and
Retention of Minority Students. ``In the eyes of some minority
students, knowledge and education are equated with whites, and
perhaps ... minority students believe education belongs to one group
or another,'' he said.
   National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell
said earlier Monday that the minority student population is expected
to increase in the 1990s as the number of minority teachers in
public schools drops to 3 percent.
   Futrell said a shortage of minority teachers will threaten the
system because it deprives minority students of positive role models
and ``creates an educational deficit'' for whites because it gives
``them a distorted view of the world ... and valuable contact with
teachers who offer dramatic proof that adversity can be overcome and
that the American dream is not a myth.''
   Cavazos said more minority teachers must be recruited, and that
recruitment must begin in elementary schools by encouraging
minorities in academia.
   He also said parents should work with and encourage their
children during the pre-school years.
   ``If we educators made it a top priority to enlist the aid of
parents, think what a difference it would make,'' he said. ``We must
help all parents create a home environment that supports achievement
and learning. Too often in low-income homes, education is
undervalued.''
   Futrell noted an anthropological study that found students at a
predominantly black Washington, D.C., high school were limiting
their academic success ``so their peers won't think they are acting
white.''
   The teachers union president said educators ``have to do
something to ensure that our children don't think this way,'' and
said schools should ``develop courses and programs aimed at helping
build self-esteem.''
   Futrell said students must be told, ``It's OK to be smart, to use
your abilities and excel.''

   A woman who shot and killed a friend of her
family was married in a private courthouse ceremony just hours after
she was sentenced to 20 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.
   ``This has turned the worst day of my life ... into the most
wonderful day of my life,'' said Kathy Scifres, who married Larry
``Bubba'' Martin, a 30-year employee of the Cummins Engine Co.
   Scifres, 35, was sentenced Friday in Bartholomew Circuit Court
for the August 1987 killing of 63-year-old Clyde Cope, a drifter and
ex-convict who was befriended several years earlier by Scifres'
family.
   Deputy prosecutor Brett Niemeier maintained Scifres shot Cope at
point-blank range after a heated argument over a gasoline spill at
her tavern, Kathy's Lounge. He argued for a tougher 30-year
sentence, citing the extreme brutality of the shooting.
   ``No one has the right to shoot someone while he's running, point
a gun almost directly at his heart, and kill him,'' he said. ``She's
getting married the day of her sentencing. Doesn't that tell you
something about her arrogance toward the system?''
   Scifres' attorney, William Marshall, argued someone else was
responsible for Cope's death and said police pursued a
``half-baked'' case against his client, despite the existence of
other suspects.
   Scifres and the groom sipped pink punch and ate white wedding
cake after the brief double-ring ceremony, which was attended mainly
by close relatives.

<HEAD>Security Council Agrees to Smaller Namibian Peacekeeping Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a cost-cutting move, the Security
Council has directed that a fewer peacekeepers than originally
planned should monitor South-West Africa's independence from South
Africa.
   The council, in unanimously approving the peacekeeping force on
Monday, asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to identify
``possible tangible cost-saving measures'' to the mission.
   ``There's going to be a considerable reduction in money,'' Gen.
Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador, told reporters after the
vote. He said helicopters and sensors can monitor an area better
that ``soldiers just standing shoulder-to-shoulder on the ground.''
   Black-ruled nations of southern Africa had lobbied to deploy the
7,500 peacekeepers, at least 360 military police and 2,000 civilian
administrators under U.N. auspices _ at a cost of about $800 million
a year.
   But the council's five permanent members _ the United States,
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ want to hold the cost to
between $400 million and $500 million, diplomats said on condition
of anonymity.
   The council must now determine the strength of peacekeeping
forces and cost of their deployment under the U.N. plan whereby the
territory also known as Namibia will become independent after
elections in November.
   In its resolution, the council asked Perez de Cuellar to prepare
a report estimating the size and needs of the U.N. Transition
Assistance Group.
   When the report is ready, probably in about two weeks, the
council will vote on formally creating the force.
   Namibia is to gain independence under peace accords signed Dec.
22 by Angola, Cuba and South Africa that also stipulate that 50,000
Cuban troops in neighboring Angola will leave by July 1991.
   Washington has suggested cutting the Namibian peacekeeping force
from 7,500 to 3,200 because fighting has stopped between South
African forces of the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in World War I, and
the League of Nations gave it a mandate for the mineral-rich
territory. The U.N. General Assembly revoked the mandate in 1966 but
South Africa refused to leave.

   President Reagan, saying he's bitter about
former White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan's ``kiss and
tell'' book, has disclosed that he quietly prepared for his former
aide's departure for months before he left.
   The president, in an interview broadcast on Cable News Network on
Monday, insisted, ``There was no firing at all.''
   However, the president added that he planned to use a letter of
resignation Regan had submitted months before. ``I set out at the
same time, then, to start quietly, and hoping, leakproof, to have a
successor on hand for when he announced the time he was going to
go,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan acknowledged in the interview that Regan had been having
problems with Nancy Reagan, the first lady, and that one of his
weaknesses as president is that ``I know that I have a soft heart.''
   Regan, who had been Treasury secretary, and then-White House
chief of staff James A. Baker III told the president they wanted to
switch jobs in early 1985, and he approved the request.
   Regan left at the end of February 1987, at the height of the
Iran-Contra scandal, and was replaced by former Sen. Howard Baker,
R-Tenn. Reagan insisted at the time he did not fire Regan, saying
Regan had indicated at some earlier time he wanted to return to
private business.
   In the Monday night interview, however, Reagan said he quietly
hoped to be able use a letter of resignation which Regan had
submitted months earlier when the chief of staff indicated he would
not likely serve through Reagan's entire second term.
   ``There was one of those leaks that seems to be so prevalent in
this institution,'' the president said. ``And it leaked publicly.
And I guess he felt insulted.''
   Regan was infuriated when there were premature news reports of
his resignation, coupled with reports of Baker's selection.
   CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw, at one point, asked Reagan about
Maureen Reagan's interview statement that allowing Regan to become
chief of staff had been her father's biggest mistake.
   ``I saw that. Happened to be watching television and saw that,''
he replied. Asked if he disagreed with her statement, the president
said, ``No, I said, `That's my girl.'''
   Reagan said he is bitter about Regan's book, ``For The Record,''
in which the former chief of staff harshly criticized Reagan's
executive management style and also maintained that first lady Nancy
Reagan played a heavy hand in White House affairs.
   ``I was very displeased with that, and yes, it hurt,'' Reagan
said. ``None of the attack was leveled at me _ only at her. And she
didn't deserve it anyway.''
   `` ... If I can use some rather rough language, I've had a belly
full of these kiss-and-tell books, and so many of them that avoid
criticizing me, but lay into Nancy,'' he said.
   In a separate CNN interview, Mrs. Reagan was asked to describe
Reagan's reaction to Regan's comments in the book about the first
lady.
   ``He was upset,'' Mrs. Reagan said. She added the president also
``didn't like it'' when she told him that his chief of staff had
hung up on her twice.
   ``He didn't know about the hanging up the first time, because I
didn't tell him,'' she said. ``The second time, I told him.''
   Mrs. Reagan charged that Regan ``didn't tell the truth'' in his
book and said that she intended to ``tell everything _ everything
the way it really happened'' in her memoirs, due to be published
later this year.
   Reagan also was asked about reports that his administration had
recently considered attacking a Libyan plant that is believed to be
producing chemical weapons.
   ``I never like to talk about what the options might be that are
considered in anything of that kind ... And no, we had _ we were not
planning such an option,'' the president said.

   The chief executive of the
country's largest commercial bank, who has long worked to end
apartheid, is leaving South Africa to take a job with a European
firm, the bank announced.
   Chris Ball, 49, was one of several prominent South African
businessmen who flew to Lusaka, Zambia, in 1985 for talks with
leaders of the outlawed African National Congress, which is waging a
bombing and sabotage campaign to overthrow the white minority
government.
   Another member of the business delegation, Tony Bloom, emigrated
to Britain a year ago, quitting his job as chief executive of the
Premier Group conglomerate.
   Ball, who has maintained open contacts with militant black
leaders, said he was going abroad for ``personal and societal
reasons.''
   ``You know what my views are. You can look them up all over the
place.'' he told Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper.
   First National Bank, formerly Barclays of South Africa, said
Monday that Ball's resignation was effective immediately. Details of
his new job were not immediately disclosed, pending an announcement
by his new employers.
   In 1987, Ball became entangled in a bitter confrontation with
President P.W. Botha in connection with newspaper advertisements
that called for ending the ban on the ANC.
   Speaking in Parliament, Botha suggested Ball had funded the
newspaper ads. Ball challenged Botha to repeat the remark outside
Parliament, where he would not have immunity from prosecution for
slander.
   Botha subsequently appointed a Supreme Court judge to conduct an
inquiry in the matter. The judge concluded that Ball had lied when
he denied knowing that a loan he had approved would be used to pay
for the advertisement.
   Business Day, in an editorial today, said both Ball and Bloom
``took up advance positions as opponents of apartheid.''
   ``The corporate executive who gets too far ahead of the crowd
runs some severe risks, not the least of which may be
disillusionment and personal exhaustion,'' it said. ``Fighting
apartheid can be a lonely business.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Ball joined Barclays of South Africa in 1973 and became managing
director in 1984. In 1987, the bank's parent company in Britain sold
its shares, and the South African management changed the bank's name
to First National Bank.

   Moscow will begin its unilateral
withdrawal of 50,000 troops from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East
Germany in April, a senior Soviet defense official was quoted as
saying.
   Deputy Defense Minister Vitaly Shabanov said the withdrawal
announced last month by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will occur in
two phases, Austrian Television's Moscow correspondent reported
Monday.
   The first phase will be completed this year, the second in 1990,
Shabanov was quoted as saying. ``We assume it will begin in the
coming April,'' he said.
   In a Dec. 7 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Gorbachev said
50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks would be withdrawn from Eastern Europe
as part of a worldwide cut in the Red Army of 500,000 troops _
nearly 10 percent of its more than 5 million personnel.
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz of Hungary was quoted as
telling a Japanese newspaper last week that the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from his country would begin within weeks, but fixed no date.
   That country's defense minister, Ferenc Karpati, declined in an
interview with The Associated Press in Budapest to set a date for
the withdrawal of some of the estimated 62,000 Soviet troops in
Hungary.
   In Prague on Monday, Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Lomakin announced
that one Soviet division _ roughy 12,000 troops _ would soon be
withdrawn from Czechoslovakia. An estimated 80,000 Soviet troops are
stationed in the country.
   According to the Czechoslovak state news agency CTK, Lomakin said
further troop withdrawals depend ``on the attitude of NATO countries
and the development of the international situation.'' There are an
estimated 40,000 Soviet troops in Poland and about 400,000 in East
Germany.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization contends the Warsaw Pact
has the advantage in conventional forces in Europe by virtue largely
of its larger air and tank forces.
   On Saturday, the 16 NATO nations and seven Warsaw Pact allies
signed a mandate for new arms talks in Vienna for reducing
conventional troops and weapons across Europe.
   Gorbachev's announcement of a partial pullout from the East bloc
was intended to give impetus to the new talks, which are due to
begin in March.
   Hungary, which has the East bloc's largest per capita foreign
debt of $17 billion, has said it will cut defense spending by 17
percent this year. Poland has also announced plans to trim its
military spending.

   A passenger bus ran off a highway in
southern Mexico and plunged down a ravine, killing 10 people and
injuring seven, officials said.
   Tomas Hernandez Falma, an officer with the Chilpancingo police
department, said the bus was traveling from Chilapa, 130 miles south
of Mexico City, to the town of Hueycantenango in Guerrero state
before dawn Monday when it crashed into the 150-foot ravine.
   Ten people were killed immediately, Hernandez Falma said.
   The other seven people on the bus were hospitalized in serious
condition, said Javier Gomez, deputy commander of the Red Cross in
Chilpancingo, the state capital.
   The passengers lived in Chilapa and neighboring towns, Hernandez
Falma said, adding that investigators have yet to determine the
cause of the crash.

<HEAD>America Enjoys Mild Winter From Midwest To Maine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   January usually means harsh winds, bone-chilling temperatures and
lots of snow, but not this year. From the Midwest to Maine, snowfall
has been below normal and temperatures have been above normal.
   ``Looking at the weather map and temperatures across the nation
... one would never realize that it is the middle of January,'' the
National Weather Service said in a statement Monday night after the
mercury had climbed into the 40s and 50s across much of the country.
Temperatures early today generally were in the 30s and 40s.
   The relatively mild season has been a boon to motorists, joggers
and municipal budgets but a bane for snowmobile dealers, winter
festival organizers and some ski resort operators.
   ``We've really had to scrap with nature to get every bit of snow
this year,'' Matt Kelly said at Brodie Mountain Ski Resort in
western Massachusetts, which reluctantly ``loaned'' Grafton, N.Y.,
snow for its winter festival last weekend.
   Meteorologists say climatic conditions, such as upper-atmosphere
winds, haven't encouraged the kind of storms that leave a heavy snow
cover.
   ``It's pretty free of snow from the southern and central Plains
to the Atlantic Coast,'' Hugh Crowther of the National Severe Storms
Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo., said today.
   ``They have quite a bit of snow across the Northern Tier, but
it's remaining up there.''
   Much of the area from Burlington, Vt., to Bangor, Maine, was as
brown and bare Monday as it was last summer. Even in the region's
far northern snow belt, snowfall has been far below normal.
   As of Monday, Portland, Maine, had received a paltry 4.2 inches
of snow this winter, compared with a normal 30.2 inches.
   Buffalo, N.Y. _ often the butt of snow jokes _ has received just
16 inches, 30 inches below normal.
   ``We're enjoying the weather right now,'' said Buffalo streets
commissioner Stan Buczkowski. ``But we're not going to kid
ourselves. We know we've got two months of winter left, and we're
going to get some snow.''
   In the Midwest, Iowa received just 1.3 inches last month, the
seventh lowest December total in 102 years. Large areas of the state
had no snow at all. Temperatures averaged 25.9 degrees, 1.6 degrees
above normal, and on Dec. 2 Sidney and Indianola basked in balmy
65-degree weather.
   Illinois normally has had 16 inches of snow by now, but only 6
inches have fallen. Temperatures have been 6 to 8 degrees higher
than the normal 29 degrees.
   ``The 30-day outlook calls for continued mild weather, with
temperatures averaging about 60 to 65 percent above normal,'' Allan
Morrison of the weather service said in Chicago.
   In some sections of the Midwest hit hard by last summer's drought
and heat wave, the low snowfall is not expected to hurt the
replenishment of depleted water supplies, officials said. However, a
lack of snow cover can cause wind erosion, they said.
   In the West, winter has been more familiar. Colorado, for
example, has had an average snow year, with ski resorts reporting
bases of 30 inches to 86 inches.
   While Western ski resorts have had little to worry about, some
cross-country ski resorts in the East have had to close, officials
said.
   Some Eastern downhill ski resorts stayed in business by putting
snow-making equipment to use, but others said bare ground in major
cities has made it tough to persuade would-be schussers to head for
the slopes. Cross-country races at festivals in several New York
communities have been canceled.
   Many of the New York festivals, which bring in $5 million to $10
million annually, don't start until late this month or early
February, but organizers are worried. Syracuse, where Winterfest
begins Jan. 27 and which normally gets 109.9 inches of snow, is
barren.
   The weather has also put the brakes on snowmobile sales. In
Brunswick, Maine, preseason sales were healthy but ``after December
it just fell flat on its face,'' said Chris Gould, who said fellow
dealers reported it was the worst season since 1980.
   But for those who miss the snow, there's always the chance of a
change in the weather.
   ``It can turn around in such a hurry that people may not be
talking about lack of snow before long,'' weather service
meteorologist Mike Noble said in Portland. ``We could see a lot of
snow in a hurry.''

   The engineers of two trains that crashed
head-on in Bangladesh's deadliest rail accident said today that they
both had received clearance to continue their journey on the same
track.
   Railway officials said at least 114 people died when a 10-car
express train and a mail train slammed into each other Sunday
outside the farming village of Maizdi Khan, about 16 miles north of
Dhaka, the capital.
   As many as 1,000 people were injured.
   The government was investigating whether operators using a
sophisticated signaling system installed five days before the crash
gave the wrong signal or no signal.
   The engineer of the mail train, Mohammad Abdur Rashid, said the
signal at a nearby railway station was not working, but he received
written clearance from the stationmaster to proceed.
   ``I suddenly saw another train coming from the opposite direction
on the same track,'' he said.
   ``I blew the emergency horn several times to draw the attention
of the driver of the other train,'' Rashid told The Associated Press
from his hospital bed.
   The driver of the express train, Mostafa Ahmed, also said he had
clearance and continued to drive at normal speed, about 50 mph.
   Ahmed said he left the railway station after he was given a
yellow signal, which meant that the track ahead was clear.
   The investigative commission has seized documents from the two
railway stations and started interviewing witnesses and railway
officials in an effort to determine the cause of the accident.
   The government today said the death toll was 77, but its count
generally is considered low because of bureaucratic delays. Dhaka
newspapers said as many as 200 people had died.
   Officials estimated that more than 2,000 people were aboard the
trains, many of them Moslem pilgrims. Hundreds of thousands of
people gathered in the city of Tongi for the Biswa Ejtema, or world
congregation, Islam's second largest pilgrimage after the Haj in
Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

   When Miami's Overtown neighborhood erupted in
flames Monday night, city leaders immediately attempted to calm
fears by talking to angry residents. City Commissioner Rosario
Kennedy was escorted on a tour behind the roadblocks by two police
officers and accompanied by Associated Press newsman Will Lester.

   Rosario Kennedy was looking for a better
understanding of the black rage that descended upon Miami on the day
that honors the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   The Cuban-born city commissioner found her answers early today on
a dark corner of 20th St. and NW 3rd Ave., in the heart of Overtown.
   Miami Guy's Auto Parts had burned to a shell. A torched car was
turned on its side.
   The riot started after by a motorcyclist's death Monday night. At
least two officers were pursuing the motorcycle for an alleged
traffic violation. One of the officers fired a shot, the motorcycle
crashed into a moving car, killing the cycle's 21-year-old driver,
police said. Police refused to say whether he was hit by the bullet.
   Wary police in riot gear kept automatic rifles poised,
occasionally dropping the barrel toward any rapid movement.
   On the corner was a group of about 15 young black men: angry,
nervous _ watching every police move.
   The 43-year-old Mrs. Kennedy, just over 5 feet tall in her pumps
and wearing a bright red pants and top, walked over.
   What caused this to happen? she asked.
   ``How can a person shoot a guy riding a motorcycle?'' replied one
man, who would not identify himself. ``Do something about the ones
that got the guns.''
   As his voice rose, the others lost their shyness. The crowd began
to grow.
   A young shirtless teen-ager stepped forward.
   ``The blacks have been here since I don't know when,'' he said.
``But 10,000 Cubans a year ... they get jobs just like that. And now
the Nicaraguans ... ''
   Miami officials have been providing shelter at a stadium for
about 250 Nicaraguans seeking political asylum.
   A stone clattered to the pavement and several police rifles
leveled at the crowd.
   ``Don't you murder him,'' came a cry from another teen. ``We're
coming to your homes if there's another murder.''
   As the anger grew, police quietly urged Mrs. Kennedy into a
waiting car.
   During the ride through the streets of Overtown with two officers
and a reporter, Mrs. Kennedy got the scare of the night when her car
approached a group of heavily armed policeman.
   The police dropped behind the car doors and leveled pistols
directly at Mrs. Kennedy and the driver, Officer Raymond Carvil.
   Carvil placed the blue police light on the dash and the pistols
dropped.
   Gunfire crackled in the early morning hours amid the housing
projects, and officers shouted reports of ``Molotov cocktails.'' One
Latin man living in a project with his wife was reportedly beaten on
his front porch, officers said.
   Mrs. Kennedy and other city leaders had hoped this week's Super
Bowl would polish up the image of Miami, a one-time tropical
paradise, tarnished by race riots in 1980 and 1982, the flood of
refugees from Cuba in 1980 and the Colombian drug wars throughout
the decade. But she admitted the opportunity was fast slipping away.
   ``It's extremely unfortunate that it's happening now,'' she said.
   And she found more anger than she'd expected.
   ``I was surprised by the depth of anger,'' she said. ``We'll be
talking to community leaders later today.''

<HEAD>Research Shows Hostility and Anger, Not Impatience, Are Bad for the
Heart</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Heart-Hormones, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   New studies on Type A behavior indicate
that being an impatient workaholic doesn't necessarily hurt your
heart, but distrusting others and having a low boiling point does.
   The term ``Type A'' probably has outlived its usefulness, and
people should concentrate on understanding anger's poisonous effects
on the heart, Dr. Redford B. Williams Jr. of Duke University Medical
Center said at a meeting of the American Heart Association.
   ``Being a workaholic, being in a hurry, interrupting people, are
not necessarily bad for your heart,'' Williams said Monday. ``What
is bad is if you have high levels of hostility and anger, and you
don't bother to hide it when dealing with other people.''
   Experts for many years had thought classic Type A's _ aggressive,
rush-rush people _ were setting themselves up for heart attacks.
   ``Many of us had thought that the definition of Type A was too
broad,'' said Dr. Wayne J. Katon of the University of Washington.
``Dr. Williams is narrowing it down.''
   In a study to be published soon in Psychosomatic Medicine,
Williams and colleagues described a follow-up study of 118 students
who took a personality test during law school. Twenty-five years
later, 20 percent of those who scored in the highest quarter on the
hostility scale had died, compared with 5 percent of those who
scored lowest.
   The research showed that being paranoid or neurotic or avoiding
social contact were not associated with heart attacks. Instead,
those at high risk tend to harbor a cynical mistrust of other
people's motives. They get angry often and openly express their
displeasure, rather than holding it in.
   Williams said this makeup could be a problem for perhaps 20
percent of the population, and they probably have these tendencies
from birth.
   Such people tend to get furious, for instance, in slow-moving
bank lines. They complain to themselves about why other customers
haven't filled out their deposit slips ahead of time and may show
their unhappiness by making sour faces or even surly comments to
those ahead of them.
   ``I'm not talking about anxiety waiting in line,'' Williams said.
``I'm talking about anger.''
   There is no evidence to support the common belief that people are
better off expressing their anger rather than keeping it to
themselves, Williams said.
   Whether people can help themselves by trying to control their
feelings of rage is still not clear, but Williams said that such
attempts at behavior change are harmless and may help.
   Researchers also are starting to understand the biological
differences between angry people and calmer folks that may explain
why they have more heart trouble.
   In behavior laboratories, researchers have measured people's
blood pressures while asking them to solve word puzzles. They found
that angry people's blood pressures shoot up dramatically if they
are deliberately harassed during the experiments, while the blood
pressures of people with cooler temperaments stay normal.
   Williams said other evidence points to basic differences in
people's nervous systems, depending on whether they have hostile
personalities. The work suggests that the parasympathetic nervous
system, which counteracts the temper-pumping effects of adrenalin,
is slow to kick in among anger-prone people.
   ``Perhaps trusting hearts last longer because they are protected
by the parasympathetic nervous system against the ravages of the
(adrenalin-producing) sympathetic system,'' said Williams.

   Ringing bells and ringing speeches commemorated the legacy of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. amid renewed calls to strive for the
goals of the slain civil rights leader.
   Marchers filled city streets in San Franciso, the Liberty Bell in
Philadelphia was symbolically tapped, and national leaders descended
on King's hometown to join his family in Atlanta on the federal day
marking his 60th birthday.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams,''
President-elect Bush told black leaders in Washington. ``He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation.''
   A unity march across the University of Michigan campus in Ann
Arbor drew about 2,000 people, who paraded as the university's
carillon played ``We Shall Overcome,'' the anthem of the civil
rights movement.
   Later Monday, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young told a University of
Michigan audience that, ``The world King left is not a great deal
different.''
   ``But there seems to be an awareness that violence is not the
solution to the world's problems, as we learned in Vietnam, as the
Russians have learned in Afghanistan, and as the PLO has learned.''
   Nowhere was King's influence felt more strongly than in Selma,
Ala., where he began the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march that helped
establish voting rights for blacks throughout the South.
   On Monday, three blacks were sworn in as members of the Dallas
County Commission in Selma. They became the first black Dallas
County commissioners since Reconstruction and gave the five-member
commission a black majority.
   ``We bring home to Dallas County the harvest of the Martin Luther
King voting rights act,'' said U.S. District Judge U. W. Clemon, the
first black federal judge in Alabama, who administered the oath of
office.
   King's widow, Corretta Scott King, was joined by black and white
political leaders for the annual ecumenical service at the Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King and his father preached.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, once one of King's young lieutenants,
used the occasion to criticize the Reagan administration's civil
rights record and President Reagan's suggestion that civil rights
leaders bolster their position by fostering an attitude of
oppression among blacks.
   Jackson called Reagan's statements ``petty comments from the same
man who implied that Martin Luther King Jr. was a communist.''
   In Pretoria, South Africa, U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins, who is
black, marked the holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King that
will sit in a new U.S. embassay compound. The ceremony included
blacks and whites who have been prominent critics of South Africa's
system of racial separation.
   In the United States, parades were held in places like New
Orleans, Honolulu, Atlanta and San Antonio, where 15,000 people
marching from four directions converged on Martin Luther King Jr.
Plaza.
   ``I took part because Dr. King's dream has not been fully
realized,'' said Elbert Winbush, 32, of Oakland, Calif., who joined
10,000 others in the San Francisco parade with his three daughters.
   King would have been 60 on Sunday. He was 39 years old when he
was shot to death by a sniper in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968.
   King's birthday was first celebrated as a national holiday in
1986, three years after Congress named the third Monday in January
as a holiday in his honor. All but six states have adopted the day
as a state holiday. The six states are Arizona, New Hampshire,
Montana, Idaho, South Dakota and Wyoming.
   In Philadelphia, when black leaders symbolically struck the
Liberty Bell as a signal for bells to ring nationwide, Mayor W.
Wilson Goode cited the bell's famous crack.
   ``That crack is a symbol that there are some things
unfulfilled,'' Goode said.
   At the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, children struck the state's
replica of the Liberty Bell.
   ``He was a great man and he believed in what he was doing. He
tried to bring peace between all kinds of people,'' said Sharonda
Gardenhire, 10, of Lansing, shortly after she gave the rope a tug.
   A speech by one of King's sons in Eugene, Ore., was delayed for
about an hour after two telephoned bomb threats. The observance
resumed after the building was search and no bomb was found.
   Martin Luther King III said that in the 21 years since his father
was assassinated ``this nation has made great strides.'' But he
added that, ``I've got news for you. We've still got a long way to
do.''

   Martin Luther King Jr.'s battles for voting
rights were remembered as the first black county commissioners
elected in 112 years were sworn in by Alabama's first black federal
judge.
   ``We bring home to Dallas County the harvest of the Martin Luther
King voting rights act,'' said U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon, who
administered the oath of office Monday to the three blacks and two
whites in the county's new government.
   The election of the first blacks to the Dallas County Commission
since Reconstruction followed 10 years of legal combat that
abolished the old at-large election system which had kept the panel
all white for more than a century.
   Under the new election plan, commissioners are elected from five
districts, three with large or nominal black voting majorities.
Dallas County, with a population of 55,000, is about 56 percent
black.
   The three black commissioners _ Erskine Minor, D.L. Pope and
Perry Varner _ were sworn in along with white commissioners Deans
Barber and Doug Morrow at a courthouse ceremony in which the
overflow crowd of about 300 sang ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
   The ceremony coincided with Alabama's state holiday for both
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and King, who led the 1965
Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march. The march took place with
federal protection after a band of marchers were beaten and routed
by mounted state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which crosses
the Alabama River at Selma.
   ``Bloody Sunday,'' as the bridge violence became known, drew
national attention to the next march led by King, which helped
inspire passage of the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act.
   ``I suspect there is no place on this planet that is more
identified with Dr. King and his quest for American justice than
right here in Selma, Alabama,'' James P. Turner said after Monday's
ceremony a few blocks from the bridge.
   Turner investigated violence against voting rights marchers in
1965 and is acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights
division for the Reagan administration. He and a team of Justice
Department lawyers helped win the election system change in Selma.
   ``I predict that someday students of modern history will point to
Selma, Alabama, as 20th century America's cradle of democracy, where
people of all races began to live Doctor King's dream of
brotherhood,'' Turner said.

   Citing new evidence, the government has reopened
the case of four people jailed for life in two 1974 bombings of
British pubs that killed seven people, including three soldiers, and
injured 91.
   The bombings occurred during a wave of IRA terrorism, and
champions of the ``Guildford Four'' said the government had in its
zeal to obtain convictions ignored evidence that pointed to other
suspects.
   The Irish government welcomed Monday's decision, and The Times of
London said in an editorial today that it was ``as difficult as it
was wise.''
   Responding to pressure that made the case a cause celebre in
Britain and Ireland, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told Parliament
Monday that new information had emerged meriting that the case be
heard by the Court of Appeal.
   Carole Richardson, 31; Patrick Armstrong, 36; Paul Hill, 34, and
Gerry Conlon, 33, were convicted of planting bombs in two pubs
frequented by British soldiers in Guildford, a town southwest of
London, in October 1974. Five people, including two soldiers, were
killed and 65 injured.
   Armstrong and Hill also were convicted of a pub bombing in the
London suburb of Woolwich a month later in which the bartender and a
soldier died and 26 people were injured.
   All four were sentenced to life imprisonment in October 1975, and
two years later a court rejected their appeal.
   In a written reply to a lawmaker's question, Hurd said he was
satisfied that ``there are new and substantial points which clearly
... are best considered by the court.''
   These, he said, included apparent alibis for Hill and Miss
Richardson that had never been put to a court, and indications that
Miss Richardson was injected with drugs during her interrogation and
suffering symptoms of withdrawal from barbiturates.
   ``The possible effects of these drugs on the reliability of her
statements were not adequately exposed to the jury or the Court of
Appeal,'' Hurd said.
   However, Hurd declined to act on a point of law raised by two
senior British judges who have argued that the appeals court ruled
against the four despite being aware of confessions by two Irish
Republican Army men to the bombings.
   The Irish government, in a statement, said it ``has consistently
conveyed the serious concern about the Guildford Four case to the
British authorities.'' Grant McKee, co-author of ``Time Bomb,'' a
recent book on the case, said: ``We are very gratified that this is
the first official recognition of the justifiable concern about this
case which has attracted people of the eminence of two archbishops,
two Law Lords and two former Home Secretaries.''
   The archbishops are Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie,
spiritual head of the Church of England, and Archbishop of
Westminster Cardinal Basil Hume, leader of Roman Catholics in
England and Wales. The Law Lords, two of Britain's most senior
judges, are Lord Devlin and Lord Scarman. The two former Home
Secretaries are Merlyn Rees and Lord Jenkins.
   Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Primate of All
Ireland, called Monday's move a ``culmination of the efforts of
people in Britain and Ireland who have become convinced of the
innocence of these people.''
   It is the second time in two years that the government has
reopened a case involving people convicted of IRA terrorism who
claimed to be victims of a miscarriage of justice.
   Six Irishmen serving life terms for pub bombings in Birmingham in
1974 that killed 21 people went before the Court of Appeal after a
similar campaign but their convictions were upheld last year.
   Like the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four have figured strongly
in Anglo-Irish relations. They are held up as examples by those who
claim British courts are biased against the Irish or those who
sympathize with the IRA.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the 95
percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

   Voice of America it won't be, but a state
official is hoping to start a little ``Voice of Kentucky'' of sorts.
   And little it will be if Paul Warnecke starts broadcasting
governmental proceedings on 10 watts of power. That's roughly a
five-mile radius from the transmitter.
   Warnecke, director of the Division of Telecommunications, wants
the AM station to promote tourism in Frankfort.
   No disc jockeys have been chosen, and no decision has been made
about whether Gov. Wallace Wilkinson will figure in the programming.
However, a contract to build the transmitter will be put to bid
later this month, and whoever gets the contract will have to apply
for a licence from the Federal Communications Commission on behalf
of the state.
   Vicky Dennis of the Tourism Cabinet said programming likely would
include publicity about attractions in Frankfort and Franklin County.
   Motorists would be alerted to the broadcast by signs along the
highway, Dennis said. It's hoped the message would lure drivers into
the capital city.
   The small coverage area would be similar to the low-power
broadcasts that some major airports use to keep travelers aware of
traffic conditions.

<HEAD>Minister Apologizes for Giving Out Bonuses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of China's Water Resources Ministry has
apologized for handing out holiday bonuses in defiance of a
government call for public frugality, the government news agency
said today.
   Xinhua reported that Minister Yang Zhenhuai acknowledged he
indiscriminately used state funds by giving each ministry employee
$12.40 _ about half the average monthly wage _ to help celebrate
National Day on Oct. 1.
   ``I myself take responsiblity for the mistake,'' he said, adding
that his predecessors had always encouraged plain living and hard
work but he had failed to carry out this tradition.
   His comments came after the State Council, China's cabinet,
listed the ministry among government offices that ignored an order
to cut spending by 20 percent by giving holiday bonuses.
   China's leaders have called on government offices to take the
lead in an austerity program designed to reduce nearly 20 percent
inflation.
   Xinhua said the Auditing Administration has warned staff members
that indiscriminate distribution of cash and goods will be dealt
with severely.
   Next month is the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, China's
biggest holiday.

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Human Rights Policies Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two human rights organizations have chastised the
Reagan administration for providing military and financial
assistance to military groups with poor human rights records.
   In particular, the organizations cited aid to the Contra rebels
in Nicaragua, the UNITA insurgency in Angola, and the national
armies of El Salvador, Guatemala, the Philippines, and the Sudan.
   The criticism was detailed in a report, ``The Reagan
Administration's Record on Human Rights in 1988,'' issued Monday by
the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and Human Rights Watch, a
New-York based organization that monitors and promotes human rights
worldwide.
   The two groups praised the Reagan administration for placing a
greater emphasis on human rights during the last few years than it
had earlier.
   The report noted the administration's insistence that human
rights occupy a prominent place in the U.S.-Soviet agenda, which it
said has led to improvements in human rights in the Soviet Union,
including the release of hundreds of political and religious
prisoners.
   While the report acknowledged that Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev was also responsible for these changes, the Reagan
administration was credited with taking ``advantage of the Gorbachev
opening'' by placing ``consistent pressure on human rights issues.''
   But the report chastised the Reagan administration for largely
disregarding ``rights transgressions in a host of friendly countries
which attract little public attention in the United States, such as
Kenya, Somalia and the Sudan in Africa; Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka in Asia; and Jordan, Morocco and Saudi Arabia in the
Middle East.''
   According to the report, ``human rights violations often were
overlooked out of fear that criticizing an ally, particularly allied
militaries fighting leftist rebellions, would create an opportunity
for communist influence.''
   For example, it said the United States was ``a vocal apologist
for gross abuses'' in Turkey because the country is seen as a
front-line state against the Soviet army.
   The report said the administration's ``most conspicuous failing''
was that it ``rarely protested abuses committed by the military once
a civilian occupied a presidential palace ... Moreover, in certain
cases, such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and occasionally the
Philippines, the administration minimized abuses or denied that they
were taking place.''
   The administration also was attacked for refraining from
criticizing human rights violations by Israel against Palestinians
in occupied territories.
   But the report praised the administration for providing
``pressure at key moments to nudge certain dictators and military
juntas allied with the United States towards elections, as well as
to protect newly elected civilian governments against military
coups.''
   For example, the report stated that in El Salvador, Guatemala,
the Philippines and South Korea, the administration played a role in
``easing out dictators and military juntas and replacing them with
elected heads of state.'' It also praised U.S. action in Haiti,
Paraguay and Chile.
   In Argentina, Bolivia, El Salvador and the Philippines, the
report gave the Reagan administration credit for weighing ``in at
key moments when restive militaries threatened to overwhelm newly
elected civilian presidents.''
   The report called on the incoming Bush administration ``to report
human rights violations accurately and to speak out against serious
abuses wherever they are found.''
   Human Rights Watch includes the organizations Americas Watch,
Asia Watch and Helsinki Watch. The Lawyers Committee is a public
interest law center working to promote international human rights
law and legal procedures in the United States and abroad.

<TEXT>
   The civil defense siren _ that Cold War
symbol of the fear of a Soviet nuclear attack _ is being silenced in
some San Francisco Bay communities where officials feel it's
obsolete.
   ``It blows and it tells you a bomb is coming, but (the bomb)
would be here already,'' said Jim Moore of Alameda County's Office
of Emergency Services.
   ``The warning system is out of date,'' Moore said recently.
``Most people don't even know what it's about. It has outlived its
usefulness.''
   Alameda County is following Contra Costa County's lead. San Mateo
and Santa Clara counties still use the sirens, and will test them
Jan. 27, but other cities, including San Jose, have chosen silence.
   In Contra Costa County, the sirens were inoperable before
officials did away with them in 1983, said Janet Grenslitt of that
county's Office of Emergency Services.
   ``It was kind of silly to have them,'' Grenslitt said. She said
most people would probably clog up 911 emergency phone lines if they
heard the sirens' slow whine.
   Moore said people today are trained to go to a television or
radio during an emergency. Like many cities and counties, Alameda
plans to rely on the Emergency Broadcast System.
   Originally, people who heard the sirens were suposed to evacuate
to shelters, Moore said. There are very few shelters being
adequately maintained, officials said.
   Still, Santa Clara County sounds its sirens on a quarterly basis,
and that won't stop, said Earl Thompson of that county's Office of
Emergency Services.
   ``Hopefully, it will pique your interest enough to turn on the
radio,'' Thompson said. ``Then it will serve its purpose.''

   An Austrian tourist was fined $1,500 after
pleading guilty to harassing whales off Maui.
   ``It seems perfectly clear that he was chasing the whales,'' U.S.
Magistrate Daral Conklin said Monday in issuing the fine for Peter
Gottwald. ``Were he a U.S. citizen, he would spend several nights in
jail.''
   In exchange for the guilty plea, the U.S. attorney's office
dropped its request for a jail sentence.
   U.S. Attorney Dan Bent, who attended the court session, said he
was satisfied with the fine.
   Although federal offices and courts were closed in observance of
Martin Luther King Day, the hearing was held so Gottwald could
return to Austria later in the day.
   Gottwald said he pleaded guilty in order to return home.
   ``This is ridiculous _ the whole situation,'' he said. ``This is
not the aloha spirit.''
   Gottwald and his girlfriend rented a boat on Maui on Jan. 3 and
went to a protected area to get a good look at the whales.
   He says he did not think he was harassing the whales and was not
sure how close he was allowed to get.

<HEAD>Michael Jackson Center Stage To Finish Concert Tour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of fans howled as superstar Michael
Jackson took center stage adorned in silver chains, resuming a
concert tour curtailed in November when he suffered swollen vocal
chords.
   Jackson's manager, Frank Dileo, had announced that this would be
Jackson's final concert tour.
   The 30-year-old pop phenomenon was clad in black when he opened
Monday night's show to about 17,500 people at the Sports Arena. He
hit the stage at 8:45 p.m. complete with synchronized light show and
heart-thumping choreography.
   Diehard Jackson fans didn't seem to care too much about his
cancellation of several concert dates, the first of which was Nov.
14.
   ``We figure it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said Glenn
Busse, a 26-year-old San Diego resident who made the long trip with
his wife, Nancy.
   The reclusive pop star embarked on a 16-month solo tour to
promote his best-selling ``Bad'' album. At least 19 million copies
of the record have been sold.
   ``Bad,'' which produced five No. 1 hits, will be recognized Jan.
30 with the ``American Music Award of Achievement.'' Some hits from
the album include ``Man in the Mirror,'' a Grammy nominee for Record
of the Year; ``Dirty Diana,'' ``The Way You make Me Feel,'' and ``I
Just Can't Stop Loving You.''
   Jackson performed an ensemble of songs from the album Monday,
plus hits from earlier days.
   Only ticket holders who bought seats for the canceled Nov. 14 to
Nov. 22 dates were allowed at the performance. However, there were
many scaplers. One man who refused to give his name said he was
selling seats for $75 each.
   Jackson performed in only one of his six scheduled Los Angeles
performances before his physician urged him to cancel the rest of
his dates.
   Jackson will finish out his shows at the Sports Arena on Jan. 26
and Jan. 27.

   Police are looking for an adult who may
have been behind an alleged drug-selling venture by two boys, ages
10 and 14, who were arrested with $226 cash and three vials of crack
in their pockets.
   The youngsters were charged Sunday with possession of a
controlled substance, but the charges were reduced to juvenile
delinquency because of their ages. They were to appear in Suffolk
County Family Court today.
   The boys told police they had been working with an adult. They
both had family court warrants against them on non-drug related
juvenile delinquency charges.
   ``It's a crying shame,'' said Suffolk County Police Lt. John
Lynagh. ``These dealers are using whatever means they have to sell
crack.''
   The youngsters were nabbed in a popular drug-selling location in
this city on New York's Long Island where police periodically swoop
in and arrest drug dealers, Lynagh said Monday.
   ``I was shocked ... When I saw them, I could not believe how old
they were,'' said Suffolk County Police Patrolman John Castorf.
   Lynagh said police want to question the adult for whom the youths
said they were working. The adult is apparently known to police but
they declined to identify him.
   Three weeks ago, Lynagh said, another 10-year-old boy was
arrested for selling drugs in the same area. In that case, an adult
who had hired the youngster was later arrested, he said.
   ``These people believe we will not arrest the children, so they
have them make the deals, '' Lynagh said. ``The kids are told to run
when they see a cop.''

<HEAD>Problems Plague Housing Once Called ``Miracle'' by Jimmy Carter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evictions, maintenance complaints and other
landlord-tenant disputes are plaguing a low-cost housing project for
the formerly homeless that was called a miracle by former President
Jimmy Carter.
   Carter helped put up the four-townhouse complex in 1986 through
his association with Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit Christian
organization based in Americus, Ga., that builds and rehabilitates
houses for the homeless nationwide.
   Tenants, who help construct the buildings, are selected by a
Habitat screening committee.
   In Chicago, tenants are complaining of verbal abuse, poor
construction and unanswered pleas for help.
   Habitat officials say the tenants aren't meeting their
obligations.
   A family of eight was evicted earlier this month for not paying
rent, the second eviction in nine months at the four-unit complex.
   ``None of us can believe what is happening,'' said Arbie Nelson,
a mother of seven who owes $1,000 in rent and is fighting in court
to avoid seeing her family become the third evicted.
   Habitat can't be expected to pick up the tab, said Patrick Keen,
an official with a Habitat chapter in Chicago.
   ``It's painful that we have to take these kinds of actions
against families, because it's contrary to everything we stand for
in trying to reform these people,'' Keen said. ``But everyone that
claims to need help doesn't deserve help, and people who are not
living up to the very basic obligation of the minimal amount
expected of them _ well, we had no other choice.''
   Several families were threatened with eviction in July 1987 after
falling behind in their rent. They said heating and maintenance
problems led to huge utility bills and other problems.
   Habitat founder Millard Fuller and the group's West Side chapter
reached an agreement with the families, reducing rents from $300 to
$264 and promising to correct the problems.
   Keen said the group had no choice but to begin evictions when
tenants continued to withhold rent.
   The latest to lose their apartment were Vivian and Marvin Abrams
and their eight children.
   Mrs. Abrams said she returned home earlier this month to find her
children huddled outside in the cold and the family's possessions
strewn along the curb.
   The family owed $1,300 in rent, but Mrs. Abrams said she had
withheld some payments to protest unfinished work on the building.
   She said she had just found a job when sheriff's deputies arrived
with the eviction notice.
   ``We helped build that house, my 14-year-old and I,'' she said.
``When I heard what was happening, I rushed home with my new boss,
and we begged and pleaded with Mr. Keen.
   ``My boss pledged to pay whatever Keen wanted, and the sheriff
said it was up to Mr. Keen, but Patrick Keen said `No,''' Mrs.
Abrams said.
   Keen said he was told by Habitat officials in Chicago to throw
the family out.
   ``There was an error made in evicting that family,'' Fuller said
Monday. ``People are going to think Habitat is a heartless
organization that throws mothers and children out in the street in
the dead of winter. That is not the case. This is the first time
anybody has been evicted.''
   Fuller said the group's regional director will be directed to
``fully investigate just what the situation is in Chicago, so we can
rectify it.''
   ``We are aware that West Side Habitat has had rental problems
with these families,'' Fuller said. But ``two wrongs don't make a
right.''
   Fuller said that of 324 cities in which Habitat operates, ``We
have had more trouble in Chicago than any other city. Only New York
has had similar problems.''

   Israel will try to ensure free access to the
resort of Taba for Israeli vacationers when it opens talks with
Egypt later this week on the disputed border area, Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens said.
   Taba, a 250-acre strip of land at the northern tip of the Red
Sea, has troubled Egyptian-Israeli relations since Israel refused to
give back the land when it completed its withdrawal from the Sinai
Desert in 1982.
   Israel's Cabinet decided Monday that the government will not set
any preconditions for the negotiations, which open Thursday in Taba
and will involve Israeli, Egyptian and U.S. delegations.
   Israel occupied Taba and the Sinai Desert in the 1967 Middle East
war and returned the desert to Egypt in accordance with the 1979
U.S.-mediated peace treaty.
   The Taba dispute went to international arbitration. Last Sept.
29, a five-member panel met in Geneva and awarded Egypt some
disputed key border points, but said it was not authorized to
determine the final demarcation line.
   The debate now hinges on the sovereignity over the actual beach
area, which has an Israeli-owned hotel and a cabana.
   At the Cabinet meeting, right-wing Trade Minister Ariel Sharon
insisted on linking the Taba negotiations with full normalization of
ties between the two countries. The Cabinet rejected the idea.
   Arens expressed hope the Cabinet decision would pave the way for
improved ties: ``We have paid the price for peace and now we want to
ensure the improvement of relations.
   ``We hope to create conditions for the continuing presence of
Israelis in the area ... and to solve the problem of compensation by
Egypt to the owners of the hotel,'' he said on Israel army radio.
``We hope the Egyptians are interested in developing the ties, in
turning Taba into an example of coexistence.''
   The radio said Israeli negotiators were instructed to seek free
access to Taba for vacationing Israelis and common management of the
Sonesta hotel there.

   President Reagan, once referred to as a lunatic and
Nazi by the Soviet media, got a respectful farewell from a
government newspaper that credited him for helping to forge warmer
superpower ties.
   Another leading Soviet newspaper gave a glowing portrait Monday
of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, calling him ``one of the
architects of the turning point in Soviet-U.S. relations.''
   ``Of course, Reagan has remained Reagan, the anti-communist and
the troubadour of Western society,'' the government newspaper
Izvestia said Monday in a front-page article. ``But the
restructuring of international relations could not bypass the White
House.''
   In 1984, Reagan quipped into an open microphone that he would
begin bombing the Soviet Union in five minutes. In the last days of
his presidency, however, Soviets recall not those ``five minutes''
but his five summit meetings with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Izvestia
newspaper said.
   ``And this is not because we have short memories, but because a
long road lies ahead of us, which we can only overcome together,''
wrote Izvestia's Melor Sturua, a former U.S.-based correspondent.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, carried an extraordinarily
intimate profile of Shultz, Reagan's secretary of state since July
1982.
   In the recent warming between the superpowers, Pravda said,
``Shultz's realism had a telling effect, as well as his sober
recognition of the fact that in the nuclear age, the
self-preservation of our two countries can be guaranteed only by the
avenues of dialogue.''
   Pravda also told its readers that the U.S. secretary of state is
a father of five, an experienced gourmet cook, an ardent golf and
tennis player and an avid devotee of ballroom dancing _ surprising
revelations in a country where most citizens know virtually nothing
about the lives of their own leaders.
   Pravda did make one barbed criticism of Shultz in its profile of
the outgoing Cabinet member, saying he had been keener than former
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to send U.S. troops ``to
different corners of the planet to defend American interests.''
   It also said his Middle East policy had been a flop, but that it
was necessary to pay Shultz ``his due'' for recognizing in the 11th
hour of the Reagan presidency that it was time to begin a dialogue
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In his eight years as president, Reagan has been labeled a
``lunatic'' by the official Tass news agency in 1983, and likened by
Pravda to a Nazi, an explosive comparison in a country that lost 20
million people in World War II.
   The state-run media also made much of Reagan's own harshest
comments, such as his March 1983 description of the Soviet Union as
``an evil empire'' and his quip the following year about launching a
bombing attack.
   The official image of Reagan began to warm with the coming of the
1985 Geneva summit, and with changes made in both domestic and
foreign policy by Gorbachev, named Communist Party chief in March
1985.
   ``Without our `perestroika' (restructuring), there would have
been no `perestroika' of Reagan,'' Izvestia said Monday. ``New
political thinking and a new world view dictated our `docking'
together.''
   ``During his eight years in the White House, Ronald Reagan
recognized this,'' the newspaper said.
   At the close of Reagan's presidency, Soviet media cast him as a
trustworthy bargaining partner. Izvestia expressed the hope that
President-elect George Bush, who will be sworn in Friday, would
continue in his footsteps.
   ``The last film made by Reagan the actor, in 1964, was called
`The Killers,''' commentator Sturua wrote. He said he hoped the last
episode of Reagan's political life, ``where he leaves the White
House and passes the baton to George Bush, (would) be called,
`Continuity.'''

   Fourteen Czech human rights activists were
still in custody today after their arrests during demonstrations to
commemorate a student who burned himself alive to protest the 1968
Soviet-led invasion.
   The group included banned playwright Vaclav Havel and Jana
Sternova, a former spokeswoman for the Charter 77 human rights group
who last year had an audience with President Reagan in Washington.
   Also among the 14 identified by Czechoslovak state-run media as
being in custody were Alexandr Vondra and Dana Nemcova, Charter 77
spokespersons.
   The arrests Monday came as hundreds of riot police and water
cannons moved into Prague's central Wenceslas Square for a second
straight day to disperse demonstrators, some of whom attempted to
lay flowers in memory of Jan Palach, who set himself alight there on
Jan. 16, 1969 and died three days later.
   Palach was protesting the August 1968 invasiton that crushed
``Prague Spring'' liberal reforms.
   On Sunday, 5,000 protesters had rallied throughout Prague, and an
official report said 91 were arrested as police crushed the
demonstration with clubs, dogs and water cannon.
   About 500 people attended a Roman Catholic memorial Mass for
Palach in the city of Brno on Monday, and the priest referred
repeatedly to ``Jan the martyr'' without mentioning Palach's name,
participants said.
   Witnesses said they saw secret police inside and outside the
church and riot police in side streets off Brno's central Freedom
Square, where the crowd headed after the Mass.
   The demonstrations have coincided with a meeting of 35 North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact countries in Vienna to
mark a comprehensive human rights accord between East and West.
   In a speech to the conference, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz today condemned Czechoslovakia for suppressing the
demonstrators in Prague.
   Shultz said the fact that police used clubs, tear gas and water
cannon on peaceful participants directly violated Czechoslovakia's
commitment to 1975 Helsinki Accords. The Vienna agreement was a
review of those accords.
   The secretary also deplored what he called ``the timidity'' of
East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia in not granting a
greater freedom of expression and assembly to their people.
   Witnesses in Prague said most of the people on the square Monday
were passers-by on their way home from work.
   As activists attempted to lay flowers, a crowd began to gather.
Police then moved in in cars, vans and with two water cannons, said
Anna Sabatova, a Charter 77 activist. They were later joined by
hundreds of riot police, and the water cannon then began dousing the
crowd.
   Police also have used force to break up demonstrations by
thousands in August and October.
   The Prague daily Vecerni Praha charged that Charter 77 was
``inviting people to Wenceslas Square and did not respect the wish
of the majority to preserve peace.''
   In East Germany, church sources said Monday that authorities
released most of the 190 people detained after police used clubs and
water cannon to break up a demonstration by human rights activists
in Leipzig.
   About 800 human rights activists gathered at a downtown square in
the southern city Sunday to demand that Communist authorities allow
democracy.
   In Plovdiv, Bulgaria, at least seven human rights activists were
arrested Jan. 11. State-run media said they face prosecution,
probably for anti-state activity. All were believed members of an
independent Society for the Protection of Human Rights.

   Three men spent 1{ hours in the chilly
Pacific Ocean when an electrical fire on their yacht forced them to
jump overboard, the Coast Guard said today.
   The 37-foot Crusader Rabbit was reported on fire Monday night off
the coast several miles north of Morro Bay, about 140 miles south of
Monterey, officials said.
   The boat's owner and two passengers tried to put out the fire but
were forced to put on their life jackets and jump into the 55-degree
water, said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Mullaly in Monterey. No
one else was on board.
   The three were unable to radio for help, but other boats saw the
flames and alerted the Coast Guard, which sent a helicopter to
rescue them, Mullaly said.
   All three, suffering from hypothermia, were taken to Twin Cities
Hospital in Paso Robles, about 15 miles east of Morro Bay.
   The boat's owner, Edward Tremper, whose age was not released, was
in serious but stable condition in the intensive care unit, said
nursing supervisor, Kathy Long. He was believed to be in his 70s,
she said.
   The two others, Gerald Lahr and Robert Long, were in stable
condition and were to be released this morning, Ms. Long said.

<HEAD>Soviets Hand Out Rations As Food and Fuel Crises Worsen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government soldiers today pushed back
with clubs and tree branches a crowd that thronged Soviet troops as
they doled out emergency fuel rations in an impoverished section of
Kabul.
   Less than a month before the scheduled Red Army withdrawal, the
besieged capital is plagued by severe food and fuel shortages.
   One woman was knocked to the ground as the crowd, ignoring
repeated shouts from megaphone-toting Soviet soldiers to back away,
surged around the three armored personnel vehicles distributing fuel
in the Khairkhana section.
   People banged on empty gasoline cans as the Afghan soldiers
shoved back the crowd. One soldier, a rifle under his arm, kicked
and punched several teen-agers.
   Soviet troops, five aboard each armored car, looked uncomfortable
as they poured gasoline for home heating into cans held up by people
who waited in 19-degree temperatures at the front of the line.
   ``My children are cold, I've never seen conditions so bad,'' said
one woman, who gave her name as Aziza, a 35-year-old with nine
children.
   Another woman wailed as she held out her hands to a reporter and
_ speaking through an interpreter _ pleaded for help, saying she and
her children were hungry.
   Asked if she thought the reporter was a Soviet, she said, ``All I
know is you are foreigners, perhaps you can help us.''
   The Soviet unit used the megaphones to spread word of the
emergency distribution as the armored vehicles, with 75mm cannons
pointing skyward, rolled into Khairkhana. In other parts of the
city, lines of several hundred cars and buses snaked around entire
blocks waiting for fuel.
   Children joined bread lines outside shacks owned by private bread
sellers, who get their dwindling wheat supplies from a state-run
wheat silo. Western aid officials expressed growing alarm at the
shortages.
   They are blamed on increasing disruption of Soviet-escorted
supply convoys by anti-Marxist Moslem guerrillas attacking the key
Salang highway, which runs north from Kabul to the Soviet border.
   First signs of the latest shortages came after more Soviet troops
pulled out early this month, Western diplomats reported.
   The situation appears to have worsened considerably this week.
   Diplomats say Soviet troops are pulling out of the capital ahead
of the Feb. 15 deadline set in a U.N.-mediated agreement. The
withdrawal comes nearly a decade after Moscow intervened to prop up
a Marxist government.
   Under the agreement, 50,000 Soviet troops left by Aug. 15.
   The guerrillas, who have ignored calls for a cease-fire by
President Najib, appear to be tightening an economic blockade of the
capital and are viewed as increasingly effective as Afghan soldiers
take over Salang road defenses from departing Soviet units.
   Officials of UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, today said the
struggle for scarce food and fuel has cut attendance at its 40
mother and child welfare clinics in Kabul by nearly half.
   ``They say they can't come because they have to stand in bread
and fuel queues,'' said Vincent O'Reilly of Ireland, who heads the
UNICEF mission.
   In the fuel line in Khairkhana, an old, bearded man, his hands
trembling as he clutched his empty gasoline can, said, ``Allah has
brought this on us. We are black-faced in the sight of Allah.''
   Others blamed the fighting or said the guerrillas were trying to
cut off the capital. Some said they now don't want the Soviets _
about whom Afghans in the street are usually openly hostile _ to
leave.

   A previously unknown group claiming to
hold a former prime minister today issued a ransom demand and
threatened to kill him, officials said.
   The daily Le Soir received a letter from the Revolutionary
Socialists Brigade asking for a ransom of between $525,000 and
$790,000 for former Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants, said Andre
Vandoren, the deputy Brussels prosecutor.
   He said the letter called Vanden Boeynants, a 69-year-old
Christian Democrat who disappeared outside his home Saturday, as ``a
representative of conservative capitalism.''
   ``It was a one-page, typewritten letter with political and
financial demands,'' said an official at Le Soir. He did not
elaborate.
   Earlier, a man claiming to speak for the previously unknown group
call Le Soir and said Vanden Boeynants ``will only be seen back in
small pieces.''
   Officials said a special police crisis center set up to locate
Vanden Boeynants received a similar call.
   The group claimed it had kidnapped Vanden Boeyants in weekend
phone calls to Le Soir and Belgium's French-language radio network.
   In Hilversum, the Netherlands, a caller purporting to be a member
of a French extremist left-wing group claimed responsibility for
kidnapping Vanden Boeynants in a call to a radio stations, police
said today.
   They said the male caller, who spoke Dutch with a Belgian accent,
said Action Directe, France's most notorious left-wing terrorist
group, was holding Vanden Boeynants. A police spokesman in Hilversum
who demanded anonymity said: ``we are taking this seriously.''
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens has said Vanden Boeynants ``had
received threats lately'' and had asked to meet with the interior
minister Monday, presumably to discuss his personal safety.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and
again from late 1978 until early 1979. He was defense minister for
seven years in the 1970s.
   He has also been a controversial politician. He received a
three-year suspended sentence in 1986 for tax fraud as head of his
meat packaging business and is under investigation for taking bribes
while he was defense minister.
   He had been scheduled to appear today before a special
legislative investigating commission.
   The 1986 conviction forced Vanden Boeynants to drop his bid for
mayor of Brussels in October.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said today he
intends to meet communist leader Kim Il Sung of North Korea in the
near future to end 40 years of bitter rivalry between the two
nations.
   South Korea is preparing a ``realistic'' proposal to eventually
reunite the two Koreas by seeing the north not as an enemy but as
``a partner that also seeks to solve this problem,'' Roh told a news
conference.
   ``Besides clearing the way for trade and exchanges between south
and north Korea, I will realize inter-Korean summit talks in the
near future and achieve epoch-making progress in resolving the
Korean question,'' he said.
   Leaders of the two Koreas have never met. On Monday, North Korea
agreed to South Korea's proposal that planned political and military
talks be headed by the prime ministers of the two countries _ the
highest level contact between the two sides since the Korean War.
   Outlining his administration's plans for the coming year, Roh
said the government would continue its efforts to build a strong
democratic system and ensure economic growth to raise living
standards.
   But he also said violent anti-government radicals posed a threat
to political stability, and said the government would enforce tough
controls to end violent protests and strikes.
   ``Stern action will be taken to check violent activities intended
to topple our democratic society,'' he said.
   The unusually tough warning was aimed at dissidents and radical
students that have mounted violent anti-government protests
demanding the overthrow of Roh's government. The radicals, who claim
Roh is a front for military rule, have little public support and
their protests, while violent, often are on a small scale.
   Roh appealed to South Koreans to work to create democratic
government and political stability. He said the change to democracy
since the end of former President Chun Doo-hwan's authoritarian
government had exposed and aggravated many problems that had to be
solved.
   ``Desires that have long been suppressed have erupted all at
once. Discord and discontent among different social strata ... have
been dredged up to expose the accumulated problems of our society,''
he said.
   The Roh government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms
since anti-government protests in June 1987 forced the authoritarian
Chun government to agree to elections and an end to widespread
repression.
   Roh touched several times on hopes for an end to the tense
confrontation with North Korea. The two Koreas have been bitter
rivals since their creation in 1948 after U.S. and Soviet troops
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II.
   The north invaded the south to start the 1950-53 Korean War and
the two sides have clashed repeatedly over the years.

   About 2,000 members of the Karen minority in
Burma have fled to Thailand following intensified attacks by Burmese
troops against their rebel camps along the border, a senior police
officer said today.
   Reporters in the area said ten civilians of the Karen _ one of a
dozen ethnic minority groups in Burma _ were wounded by Burmese
mortar attacks that began Sunday.
   Police Col. Amphon Ngamchit, superintendant of Tak province, said
Thai authorities allowed the refugees to remain on the Thai side of
the Moei River, which marks the border, but prevented them from
going deeper into Thailand.
   Amphon said about 1,000 Burmese troops backed by mortars were
attacking about 500 Karen guerrillas opposite the Thai district of
Tha Song Yang in Tak.
   In recent months, the Burmese army has stepped up its attacks
against the Karen, retaking the border village of Mae Tha Waw and
disrupting the rebels' main source of revenue _ a lucrative
smuggling trade between Burma and Thailand.
   The Karen National Union fields about 4,000 guerrillas and is
regarded as the strongest of a dozen ethnic rebel organizations
fighting the Rangoon government. It operates along the Thai-Burmese
border.
   Meanwhile, Radio Moscow quoted a Burmese government spokesman as
denying that Soviet military personnel had operated with the Burmese
army in the recent battle for Mae Tha Waw. The Karens claim Soviet
advisers helped the Burmese, especially in mounting deadly artillery
strikes against the Karen.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz today
insisted that East bloc nations implement human rights accords and
cease repression.
   In a speech to a 35-nation human rights conference, he said that
while ``we are entering a period in which respect for human rights
is gaining ground,'' there were remaining ``dark areas'' in Eastern
Europe.
   He condemned Czechoslovakia for forcibly suppressing
demonstrators in Prague on Sunday and detaining scores of them.
   Shultz departed from his text and added criticism of East Germany
where, he noted, scores of human rights demonstrators were arrested
in Leipzig on Sunday.
   As in Prague, Shultz said, most of the East Germans have not yet
been freed. He said the arrests stood ``in glaring contradiction to
the solemn international commitment'' given by the communist
governments.
   Later, at a news conference, Shultz criticized Romania for
declaring it would not be obliged to comply with all provisions of
the new human rights declaration adopted here Sunday.
   ``You have to keep calling these things as you see them,'' Shultz
said. He underscored U.S. demands that all of Eastern Europe follow
the pace set by Moscow.
   Shultz, in his speech to the human rights conference, said riot
police, using rubber truncheons, tear gas and water cannon on
peaceful participants, directly violated the Czech government's
commitment to the 1975 Helsinki accords.
   And he deplored what he called ``the timidity'' of the
governments of East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia in
not granting greater freedom of expression and assembly to their
people.
   He said their reluctance contrasted with ``welcome progress'' in
the Soviet Union and two of its Eastern allies, Hungary and Poland.
   But even in the Soviet Union, Shultz said, the release of more
than 600 political prisoners left others ``unjustly imprisoned.'' He
pledged: ``We cannot forget them.''
   Shultz, who leaves office with the Reagan administration on
Friday, spoke at ceremonies near the end of a 27-month review of
compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, which sought to ease
East-West tensions while promoting a freer exchange of people and
ideas between East and West.
   He said the Helsinki promise has served as a ``positive force for
change,'' but that Europe still lives with ``a legacy of the Cold
War.''
   In Romania, he said ``the political and civil rights of all
citizens are being ``eroded at a discouraging rate,'' adding that in
both Romania and Bulgaria minorities have been ``particularly hard
hit'' by recent government policies.
   On the other hand, Shultz said, more than 7 million East Germans
visited the West last year and about 77,000 people emigrated from
the Soviet Union.
   ``We still look for full recognition of the right to freedom of
movement throughout the Eastern signatory states,'' he said.
   The Helksinki accord was signed by the United States, the Soviet
Union, Canada and 32 European countries. It tacitly accepted the
post-World War II boundaries in Europe, which the Soviet Union had
long sought, while providing the Western democracies with a lever to
promote more openness in the East.
   Before flying home, Shultz met briefly with Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, the West German foreign minister.
   The United States has been working to dissuade Western firms from
providing technology to help Libya develop chemical weapons. On
Monday, a West German official said a West German company may have
unknowingly aided in the construction of a suspected chemical
weapons plant in Libya.
   Shultz said he talked about ``other things'' with Genscher. But
in response to questions from reporters, Shultz said:
   ``I believe having reviewed the evidence, there is no question
whatever that (Moammar) Gadhafi is trying to equip himself with a
major chemical weapons production facility.
   ``He hasn't quite got there yet. They need aid from the outside
in order to get there,'' he said.
   ``We are trying to do everything we can to throw every
conceivable monkey wrench that we can find into his machinery, and
in doing so we are active in your behalf, in my behalf _ I don't
want poison gas dumped on me. Do you ? _ and I don't want Gadhafi to
have it, or have an ability to give it to some terrorists.''

<HEAD>Gadhafi Says He's Abolishing All State Institutions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi says that all
state institutions, including the ``security apparatus'' and the
nation's news agency, will be abolished this year.
   In a speech Monday night that was broadcast by Libyan television
and monitored in London, Gadhafi said it was the people who should
rule.
   ``All the institutions which are traditionally considered as
state institutions are to be abolished,'' he said in a speech to a
Basic People's Congress, or grass-roots political committee, in the
community of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar.
   ``These companies, these institutions and all these bodies seem
to be literally imposed on you. ... They are going to be abolished
from this year,'' Gadhafi said.
   He said that although people's congresses created the
institutions, people still considered them as ``outside their power
and belonging to a government.''
   ``The struggle for power must end,'' he said in a rare
acknowledgement of internal dissent. ``The demonstrations, the
sit-ins and the protests are all protests (against) authority, a
struggle for power.''
   Gadhafi said the action would be the cornerstone for a new time
known as ``the era of the masses.''
   The Libyan leader said that he also will abolish organized
sports, car importing companies and agricultural produce marketing
companies so farmers would be free to market their own produce.
   The government will help find work for those left jobless by the
moves, Gadhafi said.
   He said the nation's security apparatus must be eliminated
``because complaints are mounting against it and its violations are
on the increase.'' Gadhafi also said the agency duplicates
operations of the nation's bureau of investigation.
   He described the news agency JANA as ``a huge octopus with
hundreds of officials'' that is ``useless.''
   ``The Jamahiriyah news agency is one of those establishments
which is tiring me. ... The news item broadcast by the world today,
our agency reports it to us the day after tomorrow,'' Gadhafi said.
   Gadhafi, who took power in a 1969 coup, has always described his
goal as the creation of a political system in which people run the
country without parties or government bodies.
   In recent months, he has made moderating moves in internal
politics.
   In August, Gadhafi announced the abolition of the ``classical
army and the traditional police,'' saying the country would rely
instead on armed civilians for security.
   Last March, riding a bulldozer, he knocked down the wall of
Tripoli's prison and freed some political prisoners. He also said
Libyans were free to travel abroad and gave his blessing to the
flourishing black market.

<HEAD>Falwell Says Beginning Of End Of Abortions Is At Hand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell told 2,000 people
at a church service that the U.S. Supreme Court's plan to review a
Missouri law might signal the beginning of the end of legal
abortions.
   ``There's no question that abortion will be done away with,''
said Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority. ``The trend is clearly
toward life and away from death. The abortionists are losing, and
that is why they are becoming so frantic.''
   The Supreme Court has announced that it will rule on the legality
of a Missouri law that bans the use of public hospitals, employees
and money for abortions. The law was struck down by lower courts and
now is on appeal.
   While Falwell hailed the prospect of the high court taking up
abortion, which was legalized in 1973 in the landmark Roe v. Wade
case, he also said he wanted more ironclad guarantees than the court
could provide.
   ``Our ultimate goal is a constitutional amendment. A Supreme
Court reversal or modification of Roe v. Wade would be a good step
in the right direction, but it is not the answer we're seeking,'' he
said.
   Before Monday night's meeting, 15 protesters marched in front of
the First Baptist Church of Snellville chanting slogans against
Falwell. Snellville is an Atlanta suburb.
   ``We want to let Jerry Falwell know that whenever he's in town
we'll be there to protest because he endorses and finances Operation
Rescue and its agenda to suppress women's rights,'' said Jack
Pelham, leader of a group called the Coalition Opposing Operation
Rescue.
   Operation Rescue is a New York-based group that staged the
long-running anti-abortion protests in Atlanta that began during the
Democratic National Convention last summer.

   Gunmen today assassinated an official
of a government panel charged with recovering the alleged ill-gotten
wealth of ousted President Ferdinand Marcos and his associates,
police said.
   A few hours after the slaying of Jesus Ronan, another official of
the Presidential Commission on Good Government received a death
threat, officials said.
   Ronan, 58, a former air force colonel and operations director of
the commission, was shot twice in the head while driving his car in
the Manila suburb of Malabon, police said.
   They said Ronan apparently managed to hit one of the assailants
with his car. Witnesses said the man was injured and had to be
dragged away by his companions, who escaped after commandeering a
motorcycle with a sidecar.
   Police said a motive for the assassination could not be
immediately established. There was no claim of responsibility.
   But commission officials said the attack was staged by
``organized enemies'' of the commission. They did not identify the
enemies.
   Commissioner David Castro said Ronan was killed because he
enforced orders to sequester companies that Marcos or his ``front
men'' are believed to have acquired illegally during Marcos' 20-year
rule.
   ``Some power groups may be trying to send us a message,'' said
Robert Federis, the commission's investigations director.
   Federis said about four hours after Ronan was killed, a man
telephoned his office and told his secretary, ``Tell (Federis) he is
next.''

<HEAD>Court Says California Redistricting Plan Doesn't Discriminate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California redistricting plan that placed
Democrats in control of the state's congressional delegation does
not unlawfully discriminate against Republicans, the Supreme Court
ruled today.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld the redistricting plan.
Republicans had challenged it as an unconstitutional form of
gerrymandering.
   The court dismissed the GOP appeal last Oct. 3. But then on Nov.
14 the justices announced that they might consider the case after
all.
   The reasons for the court's second thoughts in November were not
explained.
   Today, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul
Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to grant full review to the
California dispute. Four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Six justices joined in upholding the redistricting plan in a
one-sentence decision. ``The judgment is affirmed,'' they said.
   The court said in 1986 in an Indiana legislative reapportionment
case that gerrymandering _ the manipulation of voting district
boundaries for partisan gain _ may be unlawful even when it results
in districts meeting the ``one-person, one-vote'' requirement.
   But in splintered voting, the justices upheld the Indiana plan
that was attacked as a violation of Democrats' rights.
   The 1986 decision left key questions unanswered, and only four
justices joined in the court's main opinion authored by Justice
Byron R. White.
   White said gerrymandering might be unconstitutional if it ``will
consistently degrade a voter's or a group of voters' influence on
the political processes as a whole.''
   California Republicans said that is exactly what has happened to
them.
   ``The essence of representative democracy is undermined'' when
``a computer-generated gerrymander can preordain what the
congressional results will be throughout the decade,'' they said in
seeking Supreme Court reconsideration.
   A three-judge federal court, by a 2-1 vote last April, upheld
California's plan.
   The federal court said Republicans failed to show that the plan
deprived them of political power and fair representation.
   ``There are no allegations that California Republicans have been
shut out of the political process, nor are there allegations that
anyone has ever interfered with Republican registration, organizing,
voting, fund-raising or campaigning,'' said Judge Cecil F. Poole for
the federal court.
   Poole, noting that California has a Republican governor, a
Republican U.S. senator and 18 GOP House members, said there is no
evidence the party is ``bereft of the ability to exercise potent
power in the political process as a whole.''
   Republicans said the Democratic-controlled state Legislature
rigged district lines to allow Democrats to win 27 of the 45 House
seats from California even though Republican candidates overall
received roughly half the votes cast in recent elections.
   They said the Democrats manipulated the outcome of elections by
ignoring county and municipal boundaries and bunching Republican
voters in some districts to produce lopsided GOP victories.
   Democratic voters were divided strategically to help the party
win close races, the Republicans contend.
   GOP leaders also have appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, based in San Francisco.
   The Supreme Court has ruled in the past that election districts
must be equally populated in accord with the ``one-person,
one-vote'' principle. The justices have held that only if there is
evidence of racial bias may a district plan be overturned even when
the balanced population test is met.
   The case acted on today is Badham vs. Eu, 87-1818.

   Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
moved out of intensive care, but he remained in guarded condition
today at a hospital, officials said.
   Marcos, 71, was admitted to St. Francis Medical Center on Sunday,
suffering from pneumonia and bronchial asthma, hospital officials
said. He has been hospitalized three times in a little more than a
month.
   ``He's in better spirits,'' Dr. Calvin Wong, Marcos'
cardiologist, said Monday.
   Wong said Marcos' condition improved enough Monday afternoon for
him to be moved out of the intensive care unit.
   Wong said it was difficult to predict how long Marcos would be
hospitalized.
   ``I don't know how he got pneumonia, but he's very weak and I
guess that makes it more likely for him to get sick,'' said Marcos
spokesman Gemmo Trinidad.
   Marcos' two previous hospital stays were for treatment of
congestive heart failure. He last was released from the hospital
Jan. 5.
   A federal court hearing is scheduled for Thursday in New York to
determine whether Marcos is healthy enough to travel there for
arraignment on racketeering charges.
   An indictment returned Oct. 21 accused Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, of plundering more than $100 million from their homeland and
using the money to buy art and real estate in Manhattan. Mrs. Marcos
is free on $5 million bail after pleading innocent to the charges in
New York.

<TEXT>
   A previously unknown terrorist group
today demanded a $790,000 ransom for the release of Paul Vanden
Boeynants, the former Belgian prime minister it claims to have
kidnapped.
   In a one-page typewritten letter, the Revolutionary Socialist
Brigade demanded that two-thirds of the ransom come from Vanden
Boeynants' political and business partners and be given to the poor,
according to deputy Brussels prosecutor Andre Vandoren.
   The rest of the ransom would be for the group's ``participation
in the effort to mobilize ... the people.''
   Initially, it was incorrectly reported that the kidnappers were
demanding a ransom of between $525,000 _ two-thirds of the total sum
_ and $790,000.
   The letter, delivered to Brussels dailies Le Soir and Het Laatste
Nieuws, called Vanden Boeynants ``a corrupt person ... who has
stolen large public funds for his own profit'' and called for a
``people's tribunal'' to try him.
   Vanden Boeynants, 69, a businessman and Christian Democrat
politician who disappeared Saturday, is under investigation for
taking bribes when he was defense minister for seven years in the
1970s.
   A special legislative commission was to open a hearing today to
consider initiating legal action against him.
   The letter reinforced the belief the kidnapping is politically
motivated. It did not threaten the life of the politician, unlike
two anonymous phone calls earlier today to police in Belgium and to
Le Soir.
   ``We have VdB,'' said the caller, using the politician's
nickname. ``Who we are you will never know. You will never see him
again. We will return him in small pieces.'' Vandoren related the
threat to reporters.
   A third call, received by a radio station in Hilversum, the
Netherlands, came from an anonymous caller purporting to represent
the French terrorist group Direct Action. He said the group is
holding Vanden Boeynants.
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens has said Vanden Boeynants ``had
received threats lately'' and asked to meet the interior minister
Monday, presumably to discuss his personal safety.
   Officials have expressed concern about the health of the
politician, who needs daily medication for a heart condition.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and
again from late 1978 until early 1979.
   He received a three-year suspended sentence for tax fraud as head
of his meat packaging business in 1986. That conviction forced him
to drop a bid to become mayor of Brussels in October.

<HEAD>Court Allows Anti-Smoking Groups to Publicize Research in Boston
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed anti-smoking
groups to see and publicize a cigarette company's research that the
groups say may link smoking to health hazards.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in a case from
Boston that allows public access to material compiled for Liggett
Group Inc.
   The case stems from a lawsuit by the widow and daughter of Joseph
C. Palmer. The suit alleged that Palmer's death from lung cancer in
1980 was caused by cigarette smoking, and accused Liggett of failing
to warn adequately of the consequences of smoking.
   A federal judge in Boston ruled against the Palmer family.
   But in 1987 anti-smoking groups asked the judge to release
research conducted for Liggett that the groups said may show
cigarette smoking causes disease.
   The groups are Public Citizen, the American Cancer Society, the
American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and the
American Public Health Association.
   The judge, who kept the material secret while the suit was
pending, permitted the groups access to the documents after he
dismissed the case. His ruling on disclosure of the documents was
upheld last September by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said that under federal court rules ``the
public has a presumptive right of access to (such) materials unless
good cause for confidentiality is shown, and ... no good cause
exists here'' for secrecy.
   Cigarette manufacturers have been successful generally in winning
lawsuits accusing them of contributing to lung cancer and other
diseases.
   But in June 1988 a federal jury in New Jersey ruled against
Liggett and awarded a smoker's widower $400,000, the first time
damages were ordered for a disease said to be caused by smoking.
   That suit was brought by Antonio Cipollone, whose wife, Rose,
died of lung cancer in 1984.
   The case acted on today is Liggett vs. Public Citizen, 88-825.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Challenge to Virginia Law on Child-Care Centers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge to
a state law exempting religiously affiliated child-care centers from
some health and safety standards all other child-care centers must
meet.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that the Virginia law does not violate the constitutionally
required separation of government and religion.
   The disputed 1979 state licensing law allows child-care centers
run by churches or other religious organizations to seek an exempt
status _ avoiding many of the health and safety standards applied to
such facilities.
   Exempt centers still must meet basic health and safety standards,
however.
   Child-care centers with no religious affiliation must obtain a
state license, and are not entitled to seek the exemption.
   Among the 215 centers that could obtain exempt status under the
Virginia law, 106 have opted instead to operate with state licenses.
   The law was challenged in 1980 by three licensed child-care
centers that have no religious ties _ Forest Hills Early Learning
Center in Lynchburg, Academy Day Care in Woodbridge and Holloman
Child Care Centers in Hampton and Grafton.
   A federal judge struck down the exemption as unconstitutional but
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling last May
6.
   ``Absent the exemption, some church leaders would immediately be
forced to violate their convictions against submitting aspects of
their ministries to state licensing, or face legal action,'' the
appeals court said.
   Its ruling relied heavily on a 1987 Supreme Court decision in
which the justices said religious organizations may practice
employment discrimination by favoring members of their faith even
for non-religious jobs.
   In that case, the court unanimously upheld the firing in Utah of
a gymnasium custodian who failed to qualify for membership in the
Mormon Church, which owned and ran the gym.
   The court, in that 1987 ruling, said a 1972 federal law exempting
religious groups from a federal anti-bias law does not violate
separation of church and state.
   After the non-religious centers in Virginia appealed the 4th
Circuit court's decision, state officials filed a counter-appeal
contending that the appeals court was wrong in ruling that the
centers had the proper ``standing'' to challenge the 1979 law.
   Today, the Supreme Court denied review to both appeals.
   The cases are Forest Hills Early Learning Center vs. Jackson,
88-730, and Jackson vs. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, 88-932.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling on Labor Unions in Missouri Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set aside a ruling that
limited the access enjoyed by labor unions that represent federal
government employees to the home addresses of all their members.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling
that requires federal agencies to give employees an opportunity to
have their addresses withheld from their union.
   The Federal Labor Relations Authority decided in two cases that
denying the unions access to the information is an unfair labor
practice. But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals limited the
authority's decision in a ruling last January.
   The appeals court said that although unions generally are
entitled to the addresses, the information may not be disclosed
without the employee's consent.
   In a brief order today, the justices set aside the 8th Circuit
court's ruling and ordered the appeals court to restudy the two
cases in light of regulations published by the two federal agencies
involved.
   In one case, the American Federation of Government Employees
sought the names and home addresses of some 900 union members who
work for the Farmers Home Administration Finance Office in St.
Louis. In the second case, the National Federation of Federal
Employees asked for names and addresses of members who work for the
Defense Department's Mapping Agency Aerospace Center in St. Louis.
   The unions said they needed the home addresses to communicate
with members in the privacy of their homes about pending collective
bargaining negotiations. The unions also said the information could
help them in recruiting new members.
   The Federal Labor Relations Authority said disclosing the
information does not violate workers' privacy rights.
   But the 8th Circuit court said, ``We doubt that the public
interest would be served in any way by imposing disclosure of the
names and addresses on employees who regard that information as
private and who do not choose to receive union communications at
home.''
   The FELA asked the justices to overturn the appeals court's
ruling.
   In another development, Justice Department lawyers told the high
court that the Reagan administration is seeking to resolve the
problem by taking steps to provide the unions in both cases with the
information they seek.
   The Justice Department lawyers said they believe government
agencies should be allowed to withhold the names and addresses but
that providing the information is a better solution in these cases.
   They said requiring agencies to get the consent of employees
before giving such information to the unions violates federal law.
   The consent requirment could mean that the government will be
threatened with lawsuits anytime it gives out even innocuous
information about federal employees, the Justice Department lawyers
said.
   They said the justices should order the 8th Circuit court to
reconsider its decision in light of the steps being taken to provide
the unions with the names and addresses they seek.
   The case is Federal Labor Relations Authority vs. U.S. Department
of Agriculture, 88-349.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Dallas Lead Pollution Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
$200 million lawsuit that accused a federal environmental official
of failing to take swift action against industrial lead pollution in
Dallas.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out the
suit against the government.
   The suit was filed by 189 families in Dallas who live near three
lead smelters, operated by RSR Corp., Dixie Metals Corp. and N.L.
Industries.
   They sought damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which
allows citizens to sue the government in some circumstances.
   The Dallas families said members have suffered brain damage,
developmental defects and ``lifelong debilitating effects'' from
lead pollution.
   Their suit said John Hernandez, deputy administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, was negligent because he ordered
further study of the problem rather than an immediate clean-up after
a congressional hearing in 1983 found high levels of lead in soil
and in schoolchildren's blood samples.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here last July upheld a federal
judge's ruling that dismissed the case.
   The appeals court said Hernandez's decision to order further
study was a discretionary policy-making action immune from suit
under the Tort Claims Act.
   The plaintiffs said Hernandez's decision was based only upon
scientific considerations that did not involve the exercise of such
discretion.
   But the appeals court said Hernandez based his decision on
``economic, social and political policy considerations'' making his
choice immune from suit.
   For example, Hernandez said he was concerned that a clean-up
would set a precedent for other areas of the nation. He also said
that failure to order further study would expose him to criticism he
acted too hastily.
   One of the smelters made a pollution clean-up offer. But
Hernandez said he was reluctant to accept the offer without
additional study because the clean-up might be inadequate.
   The case is Wells vs. U.S., 88-653.

<HEAD>Former Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Fails in Attempt to Overturn Conviction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Pennsylvania Republican Chairman Robert
B. Asher failed today in a Supreme Court attempt to overturn his
conviction for mail fraud and other bribery-related charges.
   The court, without comment, let stand Asher's conviction, prison
sentence of a year and a day and $205,000 fine.
   The case received national attention when Asher's co-defendant,
former Pennsylvania Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer, 47, fatally shot
himself at a news conference Jan. 22, 1987, the day before he was to
be sentenced.
   Dwyer said he was innocent, accused the federal prosecutor of
framing him and then stuck the barrel of a handgun in his mouth and
pulled the trigger.
   Asher, a Montgomery County candymaker, and Dwyer were convicted
in federal court in December 1986 of mail fraud, perjury, conspiracy
to commit bribery and interstate transportation in aid of
racketeering.
   They were charged with arranging the award of a state contract to
Computer Technology Associates (CTA), a California company that
helps employers recover excess Social Security taxes paid to the
federal government.
   Prosecutors said Asher, Dwyer and two company officials, William
T. Smith Jr. and John R. Torquato Jr., took part in the bribery
scheme.
   Torquato, who cooperated with the prosecution, testified that he
agreed to pay $300,000 to be divided equally between Dwyer, Dwyer's
re-election campaign and the Republican State Committee in return
for a $5 million state contract for his company.
   CTA was awarded the contract in 1984, with the state rejecting a
lower bid from Arthur Young Inc., a nationally known accounting firm.
   Smith, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Asher's conviction
last July, rejecting his claim that he was tried improperly under a
federal mail fraud law.
   The Supreme Court in 1987 ruled that the anti-fraud law could not
be used to charge officials with depriving the public of its
intangible right to honest government. The court said there must be
a charge that the state lost something of material value.
   The 3rd Circuit court said the indictment against Asher and the
others did allege a material loss since the state could have saved
the taxpayers money by awarding the contract to Arthur Young Inc.
   The appeals court said even though the indictment against Asher
spoke of intangible rights, the conviction must stand because there
also was a material loss.
   Justice Department lawyers, urging the Supreme Court to reject
Asher's appeal, noted that Congress in 1988 amended federal
anti-fraud law to permit indictments based solely on a deprivation
of intangible rights. The amendments, in effect, reversed the 1987
high court ruling for future government corruption cases.
   The 3rd Circuit court also rejected Asher's argument that he was
charged mistakenly as a ``public official'' rather than as a
Republican Party official.
   The case is Asher vs. U.S., 88-532.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Nun May Be Sued for Encouraging Woman To Give Up Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled that an unwed Massachusetts
woman may sue a Roman Catholic nun who encouraged the woman to give
up her newborn daughter almost three years ago.
   Maureen Dunn, 30, of Wellesley, Mass., filed a $5 million lawsuit
charging Sister Rosalie Gilson of Hicksville, N.Y., and her agency,
the Catholic Home Bureau for Dependent Children, with ``wrongful
deprivation of custody.''
   State Supreme Court Justice Diane Lebedeff ruled Friday that Ms.
Dunn could sue the nun and the agency for social work malpractice.
But the judge denied Ms. Dunn's attempt to add as a defendant
Cardinal John O'Connor of the New York Archdiocese.
   Frederick Magovern, an attorney for the Catholic Home Bureau,
said the private charitable organization has no legal relationship
with the archdiocese, although O'Connor sits on its board of
directors. The agency's operations include the care of neglected
children, Magovern said.
   Magovern said he had not read the judge's ruling and had no
comment on it.
   Ms. Lebedeff said she found no previous cases of social work
malpractice in New York state. But she argued that social workers
are professionals since they are licensed by the state Legislature.
   The judge said that ``practicing one's profession fraudulently,
incompetently or negligently constitutes professional misconduct.''
   Ms. Dunn gave birth to a girl on April 6, 1986. Four days later
the child was placed with a couple in Hicksville. Ms. Dunn said she
was reassured by Sister Gilson that she could regain custody of the
child within 30 days if she changed her mind about giving her up for
adoption.
   But Ms. Dunn did not regain custody of the child until March
1987, after a bitter court fight.
   A Manhattan appeals court ordered the baby, Kara, returned to Ms.
Dunn after finding that the woman had signed surrender papers
``under duress and perhaps even fraud'' in a busy diner on May 1,
1986.
   The court said that agency officials did nothing when the couple
refused to return the child after Ms. Dunn said on May 20 that she
wanted her baby back.

   The body of a U.S. Air Force
officer shot down over Libya in 1986 was returned to the United
States as his brother eulogized him for representing ``the good
things that our country stands for.''
   Maj. Fernando Ribas-Dominicci was killed in the 1986 U.S. air
raid on Tripoli. The 33-year-old captain was promoted posthumously
to major.
   The C-141 Starlifter carrying Ribas-Dominicci's body from
Torrenjon Air Base in Spain was met Monday by an Air Force honor and
color guard and by family members, including the pilot's wife,
Blanca Berain Ribas-Dominicci, 36, and 7-year-old son, Fernando Jr.,
both of Austin, Texas.
   Salvador Ribas-Dominicci, the pilot's brother, said the family
was proud of what ``Paul and Fernando and the rest of the guys were
doing in the defense of democracy, freedom and the good things that
our country stands for.''
   He referred to Capt. Paul Lorence of San Francisco, who was in
the F-111 bomber with Ribas-Dominicci when it was shot down.
   Libya had said the body it released and flew to Rome on Friday
was that of Lorence. An autopsy, however, showed it was
Ribas-Dominicci.
   Salvador Ribas-Dominicci said he was angry because the body
should have been identified and returned immediately after the plane
was shot down. ``Military people are supposed to live by codes of
honor,'' he said.
   The body will be prepared for burial at Dover Air Force Base,
which handles the bodies of servicemen and their dependents who die
in Europe, the Azores, Greenland and Iceland. Burial will be in
Puerto Rico, the brother said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski today
urged the Communist Party to legalize the Solidarity trade
federation for a two-year trial period.
   He said the government ban on Solidarity should be lifted only on
condition that it be ``a partner,'' not an opponent that would
``pull the country into anarchy.''
   Rakowski also suggested Solidarity _ which was outlawed in 1982 _
should give up the financial assistance it receives from the West.
   The prime minister said that during the trial period, both the
government and Solidarity would gather ``positive and negative
experiences,'' according to a TV account of his speech to the
Central Committee meeting.
   The trial period would last until May 3, 1991, he said. That date
is the 200th anniversary of the adoption of a short-lived but still
admired progressive constitution in Poland that was overthrown by
Imperial Russia.
   Earlier today, Zygmunt Czarzasty, newly appointed party
secretary, told the 230-member Central Committee he endorsed the
stand of the ruling Politburo on union pluralism. His comments
suggested the Politburo already has sanctioned allowing more than
one legal trade union.
   Permitting more than one union is a ``social necessity and not a
gesture of the government or the party. In the interests of social
peace, social agreement has to be reached,'' Czarzasty said.
   He stressed those which receive permission to function should
show responsibility and ``above all endorse the principles of the
law.''
   The discussion is crucial, as communist leaders struggle to
decide whether to risk repeating the experiment of 1980 that allowed
creation of Solidarity as the East bloc's first independent union.
   After 16 months of exhilarating freedom, Solidarity was
suppressed in a 1981 military crackdown. Since then, the Polish
economy has stagnated and reforms have been hamstrung by many
workers' and independent groups' refusal to participate as long as
Solidarity is illegal.
   At the second session of the two-day Central Committee meeting,
the manager of southern Poland's Katowice Steel Mill warned that
competing trade unions might bring ``anarchy and divided work
crews.'' Bogdan Kolomyjski urged talks with the opposition to make
clear ``proper conditions'' for gradually introducing pluralism.
   A government source had told The Associated Press last week that
the meeting will end with a decision to offer Solidarity
legalization under certain conditions, thus paving the way for talks
with its chairman, Lech Walesa.
   Marian Orzechowski, the party's chief ideologist, told the
meeting Monday that the question of allowing union pluralism was
``ripe to be solved,'' and said a draft statement on the topic had
been prepared for a decision by the Central Committee.
   ``It seems they will register Solidarity,'' said Zbigniew Bujak,
a Solidarity activist. If so, he said, formal talks between the
authorities and the opposition could begin soon.
   But Jan Turzynski, a party leader from southwest Poland, said
groups which receive Western aid _ a definition that would include
Solidarity _ should be barred from public dialogue.
   Alfred Miodowicz, chief of Poland's official union federation
OPZZ, told the meeting Monday that no decision on trade unions
should be taken before a party conference on ideology next month,
the state news service PAP reported.
   Miodowicz' official alliance, factory-based party organizations,
and elements of the army and police remain among Solidarity's
strongest opponents, according to party sources.
   Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, said in an opening speech
Monday: ``Today we will draw directions of democracy which will
include some pluralistic solutions.''
   Rakowski asked the Central Committee when it met last month to
evaluate the opinions of local party members toward Solidarity and
return with their assessment in mid-January.
   Walesa has warned the public's patience is wearing thin after
years of rising prices and consumer shortages _ threatening a social
explosion even he might be unable to control. The country's foreign
debt stands at $39 billion and many of its major industrial plants
are outmoded.
   Unrest over communist authorities' handling of the economy has
toppled governments three times in postwar Poland: in 1956, 1970 and
1980.

   Here are excerpts from the report on former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III by the Justice Department's Office
of Professional Responsibility:
   
   Conclusion
   ``We trust that this analysis will lay to rest the claims by Mr.
Meese that the appropriate standard for official behavior is whether
an independent counsel seeks an official's indictment. We found that
the independent counsel's report far from vindicates Mr. Meese;
rather, it details conduct which should not be tolerated of any
government employee, especially not the attorney general of the
United States. Were he still serving as attorney general, we would
recommend to the acting attorney general that the president take
disciplinary action.''
   
   On his relationship with longtime friend E. Robert Wallach:
   ``We must conclude that Mr. Meese, in certain instances involving
Mr. Wallach, either did not understand, or did not appreciate, or
simply did not care what impression could be left with the public
about his own integrity and the integrity of those functions he
oversaw.''
   
   On dealing with Wallach on subjects as varied as Wedtech Corp.
and the Iraqi oil pipeline:
   ``The subjects varied, but a strong undercurent flows through a
not insubstantial number of those communications and that
undercurrent was Mr. Wallach's seeking action in matters in which he
had a financial interest from Mr. Meese or his staff. Mr. Meese
continued to accept these communications, gave no indication
whatsoever that he was not receptive to them, and took them into
account in various official actions.
   ``We have discovered no evidence that any other friend of Mr.
Meese had a relationship remotely similar to that enjoyed by Mr.
Wallach.''
   
   Regarding the $1 billion proposed Iraqi oil pipeline, in which
Wallach was representing Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, and dealings
with then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane:
   ``In the pipeline matter, Mr. Meese knew that his close friend
had a financial interest in the project; nevertheless, he called Mr.
McFarlane (which resulted in a meeting between McFarlane, Wallach
and Rappaport).
   ``In addition, that call intentionally circumvented the
Department of State, and thereby initiated a sequence of events
involving important foreign policy considerations without the
participation of the principal foreign policy arm of the government.
... His call facilitated a private venture with enormous profit
potential to private individuals, including Mr. Meese's friend and
creditor, Mr. Wallach.''

<HEAD>Chinese Near Limit of Subsidized Wheat Purchases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporters have sold an additional
200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices,
almost cleaning out Beijing's current authorization under the
program, the Agriculture Department said today.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of 1 million
tons authorized Dec. 30 for China under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Under the EEP arrangement, exporters can sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. Exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   The wheat sales were handled by two companies: Cargill Inc.,
115,000 tons, and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 85,000 tons.
   Sims said the wheat was sold for March shipment and will carry an
average subsidy rate of $22.49 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel.
   Only 10,000 tons remain available to China under the program, he
said.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 200,000 tons of wheat would be about 7.34 million
bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $4.09 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $30 million.

   Soldiers today dynamited the homes of three
Palestinians suspected of injuring three Israelis with stones,
marking a new get-tough policy against rock throwers in the occupied
territories.
   In the occupied West Bank, a 17-year-old Palestinian was fatally
shot in the stomach during a clash with troops, and a second
teen-ager died of a gunshot wound to the heart suffered in a clash
Jan. 7, hospital officials and Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed one death and said it was checking the second
report.
   Sixteen Palestinians were shot and wounded today in
confrontations in the West Bank, occupied Gaza Strip and Arab east
Jerusalem, the reports said.
   Also today, some reserve soldiers complained to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir of their role in the violence, saying they were
forced to beat innocent people and betray Israeli values in trying
to put down the 13-month Palestinian uprising.
   The criticism came as Shamir visited an army tent camp outside
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city.
   The soldiers said they routinely beat innocent people to instill
fear in them and enforce order. Many said they were ashamed.
   ``When I get up in the morning, I say to myself, `Now I have to
go out and catch a man,' and I look at his hands and see he is a
working man like myself. And I have to slap him or beat him
murderous blows to get him to fear me,'' said a soldier who
identified himself as Yotam from Tiberias.
   Today's housing demolitions drew immediate protests from
left-wing Israeli groups. Five opposition parties filed a motion of
no-confidence in the government to be debated by Parliament on
Wednesday, Israel radio reported.
   Gen. Amram Mitzna, head of the Central Command, said the
demolitions in the West Bank town of Kalkilya were intended to stem
an upsurge in violence. The army said two other houses in the town
were sealed up.
   After the demolitions, soldiers dropped leaflets on the town from
a helicopter. The leaflets said troops would destroy the homes of
anyone caught stoning Israeli targets, Arab news reports said.
   The army said more Palestinians were wounded in the past month
than in any other during the uprising, as soldiers responded to
increased attacks and rioting. It said 26 Palestinians were killed
and 492 wounded in the month ending Jan. 9.
   At least 361 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the revolt
against Israel's 21-year rule of the West Bank and Gaza.
   The latest victim was Ibrahim Abu Syam of Faraa refugee camp near
Nablus. He was shot during a confrontation with troops, Arab reports
said.
   An army spokesman confirmed there was a clash in Faraa but said
he had no reports of casualties.
   Today's other victim was Issa Taka Manasra, 19, of Bani Naim near
the West Bank city of Hebron, who died at a hospital in Jerusalem, a
hospital official said. The army confirmed the death.
   Mitzna said troops will be allowed to fire rubber and plastic
bullets more liberally to quell riots, despite controversy over the
ammunition following the recent deaths of four Arab youths hit by
rubber bullets.
   ``Since stone-throwings have become a major nuisance we will use
all the means at our disposal and everywhere _ strict punishments
and deterrents _ so that the rebels, who consider these attacks to
be legitimate, will understand that we will not tolerate them,''
Mitzna said on army radio.
   ``Lately we have widened our measures, including among other
things, the use of plastic and rubber bullets,'' said Mitzna, adding
that they have been ``effective in confronting violence.''
   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy army spokesman, said house demolitions
would apply only to severe cases of rock-throwing that cause serious
injury or damage.
   ``We are trying to signal that those throwing rocks and causing
harm will pay a higher price,'' he said.
   The new crackdown will also involve heavier fines _ more than
$1,000 _ on the parents of stone-throwers under age 14, Gissin said.
   An army spokesman said the homes destroyed today belonged to a
group of Palestinians suspected in several recent stoning attacks,
including an assault on a vehicle Dec. 17 that injured three people.
   Army radio said 15 people in the group were arrested, and the
army said the suspects belonged to Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement.
   The assaults were the first the army has blamed on Palestinians
linked to Arafat since the PLO chief renounced terrorism last month,
a move that led Washington to break its ban on official contacts
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began, Israel has routinely
destroyed the homes of suspects in serious assaults. Today's
demolitions raised to 152 the number of homes wrecked during the
uprising, according to army figures.

<HEAD>Court To Review $181,000 Attorneys' Fee Award in Airline Sex Bias
Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case of particular
interest to lawyers and civil rights activists, today agreed to
review a $181,000 attorneys' fee award stemming from a 1970 airline
sex bias lawsuit.
   The justices said they will decide whether people who intervene
in civil rights cases _ and are not the principal defendants _ may
be forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who
successfully sue.
   The case stems from a 1970 suit that challenged the policy of
Trans World Airlines to fire female flight attendants when they
became mothers.
   The policy was attacked as illegal sex discrimination barred by
Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   A nine-year legal battle was resolved in 1979 when TWA agreed to
reinstate fired women with seniority from the date of their
dismissal. The airline, which had abandoned its ``no-motherhood''
policy soon after the suit was filed, also created a $3 million fund
for the fired attendants.
   The settlement was challenged by the Independent Federation of
Flight Attendants on behalf of TWA flight attendants who could
suffer from the lawsuit's settlement by being laid off in favor of
those with the newly won seniority.
   The union acted as an intervenor in the suit, interjecting itself
as a concerned third party rather than as either defendant or
plaintiff.
   The union's challenge to the settlement proved unsuccessful, and
last May the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the union to
reimburse the women who won the suit $180,915 in legal fees.
   The appeals court noted that the union argued ``that because it
intervened solely to assert the rights of its non-discriminating
incumbent members, it should be viewed in practical terms as a
plaintiff and hence assessed attorneys' fees only if it its
opposition to the settlement was found to have been groundless.''
   But the appeals court said the union's reasoning ``could
substantially undermine'' a federal law aimed at giving citizens an
incentive to challenge unlawful discrimination by assuring their
legal costs will be reimbursed if they win.
   ``We are not inclined to look favorably upon such a potentially
injurious exception to this long-standing legislative scheme,'' the
appeals court said.
   The fact that the women who sued were awarded more than $1.25
million in legal fees from TWA does not let the union off the hook,
the appeals court added.
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, the union said the 7th Circuit
court ruling conflicts with decisions by other federal appeals
courts.
   The union also said that it only was fulfilling its
responsibility to its members when it challenged the settlement to
the suit.
   Hundreds of TWA flight attendants were laid off beginning in
October 1979 when a recession hit the airline industry, the union
said. It said some would have been able to keep their jobs were it
not for the settlement that awarded seniority to the fired women who
sued TWA.
   The high court's ruling in the case, expected by July, will
affect numerous suits in which violations of civil and
constitutional rights are alleged.
   The case is Independent Federation of Flight Attendants vs.
Zipes, 88-608.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's prime minister today said President-elect
George Bush is working more to justify U.S. policy in Lebanon than
to free American hostages there.
   Bush recently indicated Iran could help free nine U.S. hostages
held by Shiite Moslems believed loyal to Iran.
   But Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran gave little
encouragement.
   He said the hostage issue was an ``internal question of
Lebanon,'' and his country ``is limited because it is a question of
territory.''
   Musavi was asked at a news conference what Tehran can do to help
the hostages, in view of the impending change of U.S. administration.
   As for Bush, Musavi said he believed ``he is, more than trying to
work for the release, trying to justify his policy'' in Lebanon.
   The Iranian hinted the United States should rethink its policy
toward Lebanon but did not say what changes should be made.
   Musavi also maintained ``it's not clear who these groups are who
take hostages'' in Lebanon.
   He arrived in Italy on Monday for talks to improve economic
relations. The two-day visit was his first to a Western country
since Iran and Iraq agreed Aug. 20 to a cease-fire in their 8-year
war.
   In a recent interview, Bush said the cease-fire ``has potential
for amelioration of that hostage situation, but I think it would be
improper to assume that Iran controls a key to all these hostages.''
   Still, Bush said ``it's in our interests to have better relations
with Iran.''
   In Rome, Musavi also criticized an international declaration
issued in Paris last week on chemical weapons, saying ``People can
still easily construct chemical arms.'' The declaration is not
binding on the 149 nations that said they are against the use and
spread of chemical arms.
   Musavi reiterated Iran's charges that Iraq used chemical weapons
during their war _ an allegation Iraq denies.
   Musavi left for an audience with Pope John Paul II that was the
Roman Catholic Church leader's first with an official of the Islamic
republic.
   The pope urged that Iran and Iraq exchange their 100,000
prisoners of war as soon as possible ``to alleviate the suffering of
these men and to give back to so many families the joy of being
together again,'' according to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   As the private audience went on in the pope's library, police
dispersed about 30 supporters and opponents of the Iranian
government who shoved each other and yelled insults in St. Peter's
Square.
   After 20 minutes of private talks, the pope publicly met Musavi's
entourage and spoke briefly to Hojatoleslam Sadeq Khalkhali,
chairman of the Iranian Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
   ``Our revolution is a religious revolution and we ask you to pray
for peace in the world,'' Khalkhali said.
   ``That's what we're doing,'' the pope responded.
   The Iranian continued, ``We know the world needs religious spirit
and until there is religious spirit there will not be morality.''
   The pope then offered his blessing to all Iranians, including
``those fallen in war.''

   A fishing boat hit a floating mine and
exploded today in Persian Gulf waters northeast of Bahrain, the
official Gulf News Agency reported. It said the skipper was killed.
   The agency quoted an Interior Ministry statement as saying
another fishing boat picked up the boat's five crew members, who
were injured in the blast, and took them to a Bahrain hospital.
   Rescuers also recovered the body of the skipper, identified as
Bahraini national Yacoub Ali Yacoub, the statement said.
   Drifting mines from the former Iran-Iraq war zone, torn from
their moorings by winter storms, remain a hazard for shipping in the
gulf. Up to 200 floating mines may be left from the war, mainly in
the northern part of the waterway.
   About 20 mines have been neutralized since a cease-fire took
effect Aug. 20.
   A floating mine was believed responsible for a Jan. 5 explosion
that triggered a blaze aboard the 36,904-ton Saudi Arabian tanker
Sagheera as it sailed into the gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.
   The blast killed the Greek master and the five other crew members
of Greek and Sri Lankan nationality. The vessel split in two and
sank.

<TEXT>
   George Bush polished his inaugural address
today, trying to make it shorter, while the Senate opened the first
confirmation hearing for his Cabinet and the capital was rehearsing
ceremonies marking the change of power at the White House.
   Three days before Bush will be sworn in as the 41st president,
hotels were filling up with early arrivals from the 300,000 people
expected to watch or take part in the five-day extravaganza.
   ``The mood is very upbeat,'' said Ed Cassidy, a spokesman for the
inaugural committee. ``Rehearsals are taking place all over town.
Decorations are going up. Thousands of media people from all over
the world are picking up their credentials'' to cover the
inauguration.
   On Capitol Hill, James A. Baker III, picked by Bush to be his
secretary of state, went before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee to testify about his nomination. Demonstrating bipartisan
pride in a native son, Texas Sens. Phil Gramm, a Republican, and
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, sat alongside Baker at the witness table and
urged that he be confirmed.
   Baker testified that the first order of business for Congress and
the new administration is a ``meeting of our minds on how to proceed
with a changing Soviet Union.'' He said, ``Our task is to arrange
affairs so that whatever the outcome of perestroika, a more
responsible, constructive Soviet policy will remain in Moscow's
interest.''
   Baker also said the United States cannot abandon the Contra
resistance force opposing Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Baker's confirmation hearing, expected to run two days, is the
first for any member of Bush's Cabinet. The next round begins
Thursday when the Senate Labor Committee meets on the nomination of
Elizabeth Dole as labor secretary, and the Governmental Operations
Committee hears testimony from Richard G. Darman, chosen as Bush's
budget director.
   Other hearings will follow in quick order. None of the Cabinet
nominees is expected to encounter much difficulty winning
confirmation.
   ``They are generally experienced, hopefully pragmatic people, and
we won't have the rigid ideology of the first Reagan term,'' said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``I am trying very
hard to establish from our side an atmosphere of cooperation and
bipartisanship.''
   Bush had no public appearances on his schedule today but was
expected to announce his choices for some top jobs in his
administration. Among those expected to be named was Donald Atwood
Jr., vice chairman of General Motors Corp., to be deputy secretary
of defense, the No. 2 post at the Pentagon.
   Bush and speechwriter Peggy Noonan worked on his inaugural speech
Monday but ``she had to go back to the drawing boards. They're
trying to shorten it, edit it,'' said Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   ``He wants it short,'' Ms. Tate said, ``Something in the range of
15 minutes or less.'' Bush worked more on the speech again today and
planned a dress reheasal on Thursday using a TelePrompTer.
   Noonan, considered one of GOP's most talented speechwriters,
wrote Bush's convention speech and also worked on the farewell
television address delivered by President Reagan last week.
   The inaugural festivities officially open on Wednesday with a
ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial, featuring fireworks and 21 Navy
F14 fighter planes flying wingtip to wingtip. Tiny flashlights will
be distributed to te first 40,000 people at the event, and they will
be asked to flick them on to underscore Bush's campaign theme of ``a
thousand points of light.''
   A dress rehearsal of the opening pageant will be held today,
complete with the flyover of jets.
   Bush began his inauguration week Monday by paying tribute to the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at a breakfast for black supporters.
   ``We must not fail the nation he loved so much and gave his life
for. I understand that five days before becoming president of the
United States of America,'' Bush said. Federal offices were closed
for the national holiday commemorating King's birthday.
   As Bush prepared to step into the limelight, President Reagan was
spending a low-key week. His only event on today's schedule was the
acceptance of an award from the Touchdown Club, a sports booster
organization.

   The Supreme Court today refused to set aside
serial killer Theodore Bundy's conviction and death sentence for
murdering a 12-year-old girl in Florida 11 years ago.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, let stand rulings that Bundy was
mentally competent when he stood trial in 1980 for the slaying in
Lake City, Fla., of Kimberly Leach.
   Reacting swiftly, state officials said Florida Gov. Bob Martinez
would sign a death warrant for Bundy today, scheduling his execution
for 7 a.m. on Jan. 24.
   Bundy, 42, also received death sentences for the 1978 killings of
two Florida State University sorority sisters who were beaten and
strangled just hree weeks before the Leach murder.
   He has been linked to as many as 36 sex murders or disappearances
of young women, most of them in Utah, Colorado and Washington state.
   A federal court hearing in Fort Lauderdale is scheduled for next
Monday to determine whether Bundy was mentally competent when he
stood trial for the sorority house killings.
   But Florida officials are under no legal obligation to postpone
executing Bundy pending any conclusion to that proceeding.
   Bundy, whose case won national attention even before it was
depicted in a television miniseries ``The Deliberate Stranger,''
previously has come within hours of being executed only to win
postponement.
   Today's action marks the fourth time the Supreme Court has
considered a formal appeal filed in Bundy's behalf. One, rejected by
the justices in 1986, was a 34-page document filed by Bundy, a Utah
law school dropout, in his own handwritting.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Bundy argued that lower
courts wrongly determined at a much later date that he had been
competent to stand trial in 1980.
   Referring to numerous incidents in which Bundy exhibited bizarre
behavior during his trial for the Leach murder, the appeal said
Bundy was mentally incompetent at the time.
   ``This court has never addressed the issue of when, if ever, a
(post-trial) hearing would be adequate to remedy a violation of a
defendant's right ... to a contemporary determination of his
competency when sufficient indicia arise at trial,'' the appeal said.
   The Supreme Court in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a
``contemporary'' competency hearing.
   After the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1987 that
Bundy was entitled to a hearing to determine whether he had been
mentally competent in 1980, a federal judge ruled that Bundy had
been.
   The judge called Bundy ``the most competent serial killer in the
country at this time ... a diabolical genius.''
   The 11th Circuit court then upheld the competency ruling,
sparking the appeal acted on today.
   In other action today, the Supreme Court:
   _ Allowed anti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette
company's research that the groups say could link smoking to health
hazards.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in a case from
Boston that allows public access to material compiled for Liggett
Group Inc.
   _ Agreed to review a $181,000 attorneys' fee award stemming from
a 1970 airline sex bias lawsuit.
   The justices said they will decide whether people who intervene
in civil rights cases _ and are not the principal defendants _ may
be forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who
successfully sue.
   _ Ruled that a California redistricting plan that placed
Democratsin control of the state's congressional delegation does not
unlawfully discriminate against Republicans.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld the redistricting plan.
Republicans had challenged it as an unconstitutional form of
gerrymandering.
   _ Rejected a challenge to a state law exampting religiously
affiliated child-care centers from some health and safety standards
all other child-care centers must meet.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that the Virginia law does not violate the constitutionally
required separation of government and religion.
   _ Set aside a ruling that limited the access enjoyed by labor
unions that represent federal government employees to the home
addresses of all their members.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling
that requires federal agencies to give employees an opportunity to
have their addresses withheld from their unions.
   The appeal in the Bundy case also argued that his conviction for
the Lake City murder was tainted by the ``uncorroborated,
hypnotically developed testimony of an alleged eyewitness'' to the
young girl's abduction and by ineffective legal help at trial.
   ``It is left to this court,'' the appeal said, ``to apply the
Constitution to protect this unpopular petitioner to the same degree
it protects all other criminal defendants.''
   Kimberly Leach disappeared from a junior high school on Feb. 9,
1978. Her body was found in an abandoned pig sty.
   Prosecutors said that on the night of Jan. 15, 1978, Bundy
entered a Chi Omega sorority house on the FSU campus and attacked
four coeds, killing two and seriously injuring two.
   Margaret Bowman and Lisa Levy, attacked as they slept, were
killed.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose
capital punishment under all circumstances, voted to overturn
Bundy's death sentence.
   The case is Bundy vs. Dugger, 88-5881.

   An early morning mudslide that ``looked
like lava'' pushed a house 10 feet off its foundation Tuesday and
forced authorities to evacuate 10 other homes, officials said.
   ``I've got chest-high mud in what used to be my back yard,'' said
Robey Kaufman, whose $100,000 home was destroyed.
   The hill into which the house was built began shifting late
Monday night for reasons still unclear Tuesday, but water from a
broken main behind the house might have loosened the mud, said
Kanawha County Public Safety Director Mark Wolford.
   ``It was like a wall of mud,'' Wolford said. ``The fire chief out
there said it looked like lava.''
   Mud from the hill piled up against the back of the house and the
pressure collapsed the basement, slowly pushing the house off its
foundation and into the front yard, Wolford said.
   The Kaufmans ``apparently heard the house making some unusual
popping and cracking noises. They finally decided they should get
out of there,'' he said.
   By the time authorities were called, 12:30 a.m., the house was
off its foundation. Gas, water and electical lines had been severed,
Wolford said.
   As a precaution, authorities asked people living in the 10 other
houses on the dead-end street to leave for a few hours.
   The Kaufmans are staying with neighbors, Wolford said.

<HEAD>Baker Says US Should Aim to Keep Soviets on Constructive Track</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Restructures top, picks up 5th graf pvs, ``Bipartisanship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III
called today for a renewal of bipartisanship in foreign policy and a
joint effort with Congress to ensure that ``a more responsible,
constructive policy'' emerges from the changes reshaping the Soviet
system.
   ``Yes, this is an appeal for a kinder, gentler Congress,'' Baker
said at a hearing by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on his
nomination to take over the State Department after President-elect
Bush takes office. Baker was the first of Bush's Cabinet choices to
start then confirmation process.
   Baker also said the United States cannot abandon the Contra
rebels opposing Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``We must stand by them until our mutual goals are achieved,''
Baker said, adding that the United States must insist on protection
for human rights not only in Nicaragua but in El Salvador and other
Central American nations as well.
   He said the premier task of U.S. policy must be make certain that
the Soviets move toward positive changes.
   ``Our task is to arrange affairs so that whatever the outcome of
perestroika, a more responsible, constructive Soviet policy will
remain in Moscow's interest,'' Baker said.
   Sketching a broad outline of the foreign policy goals of the
incoming administration, Baker said experience has shown that a
bipartisan foreign policy is an indispensable ingredient of success
as the nation faces the problems and turmoil of an increasingly
complex world.
   ``Bipartisanship does not mean that we must always agree,'' Baker
said. ``There are and always will be differences in approach and
substance.''
   ``But eventually we must proceed,'' he said. ``And when we do it
is best that we do so together if we are to achieve the national
interest.''
   ``Yes, this is an appeal for a kinder, gentler Congress,'' Baker
said. ``Bipartisanship ... is the lubricant that enables the
branches of government to overcome their natural constitutionally
designed friction, a friction that arises from our differences of
perspectives and our different responsibilities.''
   ``As a realist, I know we need bipartisanship to succeed,'' Baker
said. ``In order to succeed we must work together.''
   The first order of business between the Republican administration
and the Democratic-run Congress, he suggested, is a ``meeting of our
minds on how to proceed with a changing Soviet Union.''
   Baker suggested that if that happens, conclusions will include
the need to modernize U.S. conventional and nuclear weapons, to set
``realistic and prudent standards'' for conventional arms control
and to reach a common approach on the issue of loans and credits to
the Soviet Union.
   ``Realism forces us to be prudent,'' Baker said. ``However
fascinating the twists and turns of perestroika (economic
restructuring) may be and however riveting the details of decline as
reported in Soviet newspapers, the Soviet Union remains a heavily
armed superpower.''
   ``The talk is different but the force structure and policies that
support far-reaching interests and clients have not changed
commensurately,'' the nominee said. ``Many of those policies and
those clients are hostile to American values and threaten our
interests. That's a reality.''
   Baker proposed a multi-step approach to Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's new policies, among them:
   _Continue to welcome reform and changes.
   _Recognize that U.S. policies and strength have contributed to
Moscow's new sense of realism.
   _Continue to probe the Soviets on arms control, human rights,
regional conflicts and overall relations.
   _Place additional emphasis on ending regional conflicts in Asia,
Africa and Central America and ``not allow the rhetoric of restraint
to become a substituter for restraint itself.''
   _Seek help from the Soviets in dealing with such global problems
as drugs, terrorism and the environment and if it is not
forthcoming, find out why.
   As the hearings opened, many senators were hoping to learn in
what areas of foreign policy the Bush administration will differ
from the often ideologically rigid positions pursued by the Reagan
administration in the last eight years.
   But Baker, a friend of the president-elect and pragmatic
political ally of longstanding, may be hindered in his responses by
his lack of direct foreign policy experience. Baker, Reagan's former
chief of staff and secretary of the treasury, did obtain experience
dealing with the world's financial leaders during his years at the
Treasury in Reagan's first term.
   He drew up the Baker plan to deal with Latin American debt. The
plan calls for increased lending by commercial banks to Latin
America in return for economic restructuring.
   Some expect Bush, who served as U.S. liaison officer to China and
director of the Central Intelligence Agency, will seek to set his
administration's foreign policy direction himself, leaving Baker to
manage it.
   Baker does, in fact, possess skill as a tactical policy manager
and a clear ability to deal easily with Congress.
   While senators will seek to learn exactly what Baker will be
asked to manage, some are dubious about obtaining concrete results,
at least this early in the game.
   ``Baker will duck every substantive question,'' was the flat
prediction of one Democrtic staff member who helped plan the two
days of confirmation hearings and who asked not to be identified by
name.
   Still, the Senate is almost certain to confirm Baker, possibly
before the end of the month. But before it does, lawmakers will seek
Baker's public agreement to consult widely with Congress as events
and policies unfold and to link hands in a search for a bipartisan
foreign policy.

<HEAD>Report Calls For Debt Renegotiation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin American nations must negotiate debt
reduction agreements with commercial bank creditors or face a
worsening economic situation that could lead to the return of
military dictatorships in the region, a panel of experts said
Tuesday.
   The negotiation recommendation was made in a report by the
Inter-American Dialogue, a grouping of 66 prominent citizens from
the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean.
   Another key recommendation was for the incoming Bush
administration in Washington and leaders of other industrialized
countries to actively encourage debt reduction agreements and to
provide ``appropriate financial guarantees'' to support such
initiatives.
   ``Six years after the debt crisis began, Latin America remains
mired in depression,'' the group said in its 59-page report.
   ``Unemployment and underemployment are at record levels,'' it
said. ``Wages have declined sharply _ by as much as 50 percent in
some places. Average income per capita has fallen back to the level
of 1978 and is not recovering.''
   The report, ``The Americas in 1989: Consensus for Action,'' said
the alternative for Latin America to decisive action is a
``treadmill of austerity, stagnation and rising debt.''
   It said the crisis could condemn Latin America ``to a long period
of economic hardship and political turbulence.''
   ``In some countries, civilian authorities may be forced to yield
to military rule,'' thus reversing a strong trend over the past
decade toward elected government, it said.
   The report also recommended that:
   _The nations of Latin America revamp development strategies,
restructure their economies and effectively integrate them in the
world economy.
   _The United States address its own economic problems and join
other industrial countries to reduce international financial
imbalances, open world markets and sustain world growth.
   _The international financial institutions, including the World
Bank, sharply step up lending to Latin America, provided the debtor
governments adhere to economic reform programs.
   The co-chairmen of the report panel were Sol Linowitz, a former
ambassador to the Organization of American States and a negotiator
of the Panama Canal treaties; and former Costa Rican President
Daniel Oduber.
   Also on the ideologically diverse panel were former presidents
Nicolas Ardito Barletta of Panama and Osvaldo Hurtado of Ecuador and
numerous former cabinet ministers from the United States and Latin
America.
   The report listed the hemisphere's major debtors as Brazil,
Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Venezuela and Colombia. They account for
85 percent of the region's debt.
   Since 1985, U.S. policy on Latin America's foreign debt has been
guided by the so-called Baker plan, named for former treasury
secretary and now secretary of state-designate James A. Baker III.
   The plan calls for increased lending by commercial banks to Latin
America in return for economic restructuring but lending levels
since 1985 have been far below expectations.
   A month ago, President-elect Bush indicated he will undertake a
major review of U.S. policy toward Third World debt because of the
``enormous problems'' facing Latin America.
   On Central America, the report called on the United States to end
its diplomatic boycott of the Sandinista government and bilaterally
negotiate mutual security arrangements. Saying ``there can be no
double standard,'' the report also argued that Managua must ``desist
from assisting insurgencies in El Salvador and elsewhere.''
   On drug trafficking, the report said that action to reduce demand
for narcotics ``must be given overriding emphasis'' in the struggle
against drugs.
   ``As long as there is a demand for illicit drugs, supplies will
find their way to it,'' the report said.

   Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in

   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and

while sales reached $503.8 billion.
   The matching 0.4 percent gains kept the ratio of inventories to
sales at 1.50, meaning it would take 1.5 months to exhaust
inventories at the November sales pace.
   When not accompanied by increasing sales, rising inventories can
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to
order production cuts and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods.
   But John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the
new report indicates that ``at least from the inventories point of
view, we think the economy is in pretty good shape for continued
growth in 1989.''
   ``Oftentimes, before a recession, inventories tend to build up,''
he said. ``There's no evidence of any kind of excesses in
inventories in the economy.''
   The November increase in inventories followed a minuscule rise
during October and a 0.9 percent jump in September. It was the 23rd
straight month in which inventories had risen, but sales generally
have kept pace.
   ``It looks like inventories closed out the year on a very lean
note, which should be a positive sign in terms of growth in the
first half of this year,'' said Michael Evans, a forecaster in
Washington. ``People remained somewhat skeptical about the
durability of the recovery. They kept their inventories rather
lean.''
   The monthly increase in sales was down from a 1.3 percent
increase in October and virtually unchanged sales activity in
September.
   The November sales gain was led by a 0.9 percent rise at the
retail level, followed by a 0.5 percent increase at the
manufacturing level. These two gains offset a 0.4 percent decline in
sales at the wholesale level.
   The government last week reported that retail sales in December
rose a lackluster 0.2 percent.
   The increase in inventories was led by a 0.7 percent rise in
retailers' inventories, followed by a 0.4 percent increase for
manufacturers and virtually no change in wholesale stockpiles.

<HEAD>PTL Founder Pleads Innocent to Fraud Charges</HEAD>

   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker pleaded
innocent today to federal charges of diverting millions of dollars
in donations from his followers and using the money to support his
lavish lifestyle.
   ``I pleaded not guilty to all charges,'' Bakker said after the
arraignment. ``I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this
indictment.''
   Bakker made no comment during the hearing, but defense attorney
George T. Davis asked U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor to impose a gag
order in the case.
   Davis read parts of an interview published Jan. 2 in which
retired U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, who presided over the
PTL bankruptcy case, called the founder of the religious
broadcasting empire a ``sawed-off little runt.''
   Davis also said Reynolds described Bakker as ``a thief.''
   ``We can't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundated
with pretrial negative publicity, especially from a federal judge,''
Davis said. ``How can we prevent this? This guy is a loose cannon.
He's already gone overboard.''
   Deborah Smith, a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor handling the
case, said the government was willing to agree to a gag order.
However, she questioned Davis' motives, saying prosecutors were
concerned that his statements were part of a strategy to get a
change of venue in the case.
   Taylor asked the attorneys to consult with each other over the
next two days and present a draft of a gag order to him by Thursday.
   Taylor scheduled Bakker's trial for the February term of court,
but set no specific date.
   Bakker and three of his former top aides at the nearby PTL
ministry in Fort Mill, S.C., were indicted Dec. 5 after a 16-month
federal grand jury investigation into PTL's operation under Bakker's
leadership.
   Bakker, 48, and Richard Dortch, 57, his former top deputy, each
were charged with 24 counts of mail and wire fraud and with
conspiracy. They were accused of conspiring to defraud PTL
contributors to support their lavish lifestyles and of diverting
more than $4 million in PTL money for their personal use.
   Last week, Dortch waived his right to appear at today's
arraignment and entered innocent pleas to all counts.
   Harold Bender, another Bakker attorney, said he has heard
speculation that Dortch may seek a separate trial.
   Also indicted last month were brothers David and James Taggart.
They entered innocent pleas Dec. 15 to charges of tax evasion and
conspiring to impede the IRS in tax collection. Taylor tentatively
scheduled their trial for the February term.
   David Taggart, Bakker's former personal aide, and James Taggart,
PTL's former interior decorator, were accused in a separate
indictment Dec. 5 of using more than $1.1 million of PTL funds for
personal expenditures.
   Bakker and the three other defendants were released on $50,000
unsecured bond on Dec. 15 by Taylor, who also imposed travel
restrictions.
   Bakker resigned from the PTL in 1987 after he admitted he had an
affair with church secretary Jessica Hahn and paid her money to keep
quiet. Three months later, PTL filed for protection from its
creditors under federal bankruptcy law.
   Last month a Canadian businessman bought PTL's assets, including
its Christian theme park, at a bankruptcy auction. The fate of PTL's
religious operations, which were spun off by the bankruptcy court
into the non-profit Heritage Ministries, is unclear.
   Bakker and his wife, Tammy, began broadcasting ``The Jim and
Tammy Show'' from their leased home near Charlotte earlier this
month.

   Lloyd Bentsen Sr., the father of Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, was killed in a traffic accident near this south
Texas town this morning, police said. He was 92.
   The senior Bentsen was killed when his car collided with another
car at a rural intersection between Edinburg and Mission, a
neighboring town just north of the Mexican border, said police Chief
A.C. Gonzales.
   Bentsen's ranch, the Arrowhead, is about 30 miles northwest of
the intersection.
   Two people in the second car were injured, neither critically.
   According to David Wells, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Public Safety, the accident occurred when Bentsen failed to yield
the right of way at the intersection. Bentsen had a stop sign; the
other car did not, Wells said.
   ``I do not know if he stopped and then pulled out in front of
this oncoming vehicle or didn't stop,'' Wells said.
   Wells said Bentsen was pronounced dead at the scene by Mission
Justice of the Peace Juan Rosel.
   The occupants of the second car were identified as driver Ramiro
Rosales and his sister, Margarita Rosales. Both taken to Mission
Hospital in McAllen, where Ms. Rosales was listed in stable
condition pending surgery; her brother was scheduled to be released
after treatment for cuts and bruises.
   Bentsen managed about 42,000 acres of farms and six ranches
scattered over a south Texas empire he started carving out of the
brush and thorn forest in 1920.
   He and his wife Dolly, who died in 1977, had three other
children: Kenneth, a Houston architect; Don, a McAllen businessman;
and Betty, the wife of Rio Grande Valley businessman Dan Winn.
   Lloyd Bentsen Jr. won re-election to his U.S. Senate seat last
November, when he also lost a run for vice president on the
Democratic ticket with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   His office in Washington declined to comment on reports of the
death.

   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III
violated federal ethics standards by acting at the request of a
close friend to assist scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a proposed
$1 billion Middle East oil pipeline, a Justice Department report
concluded today.
   ``There are three instances in which friendship'' between Meese
and longtime friend E. Robert Wallach ``dictated government
action,'' it said.
   If Meese were still attorney general, ``we would recommend (to
the next ranking department official) that the president take
disciplinary action,'' the report said.
   A department statement said no further action against Meese is
warranted because he is no longer a government employee.
   The report by the Justice Department's Office of Professional
Responsibility also found that Meese violated the executive order on
ethics and the Justice Department's own standards of conduct by
failing to disclose the sale of stocks in his 1985 federal income
tax return on a timely basis.
   The report also said Meese violated ethics standards by
participating in official matters involving the regional Bell
Telephone companies while he held some $14,000 in telecommunications
stock.
   The report's findings on ethics questions are based in large
measure on evidence gathered in a 14-month criminal investigation of
Meese by an independent counsel. That probe did not address ethical
questions and ended with a decision not to prosecute.
   In response, Meese's lawyers called the findings ``a travesty of
justice.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that
President Reagan believes ``this report was unnecessary, partly
because Mr. Meese has not been in the office for some time and
partly because it was unwarranted.''
   Fitzwater said that Reagan still believes his longtime friend did
nothing wrong. ``That's the way he feels. I talked to him and I know
whereof I speak,'' the spokesman said of the president.
   The report concluded that Meese engaged in ``conduct which should
not be tolerated of any government employee, especially not the
attorney general.''
   ``As a direct result of the preferential, improper efforts of
Meese and his staff, the Army'' awarded a $32 million
engine-building contract to Wedtech in 1982 while Meese was
counselor to President Reagan, said the report.
   The next year, it said, ``Meese and his staff injected themselves
... as a direct result of the friendship between Wallach and Meese''
into a financial problem Wedtech was having with the Commerce
Department's Economic Development Administration.
   At the urging of Wallach, Meese tried to help clear up the
problem Wedtech was having by making a phone call to then-Commerce
Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, the report said. Meese's intervention is
``precisely'' the type of activity that is prohibited by a federal
executive order spelling out ethical standards for federal
employees, it said.
   On the pipeline, Meese, again at Wallach's urging, arranged a
meeting in 1985 for Wallach and his client, Swiss oilman Bruce
Rappaport, with then-White House national security adviser Robert
McFarlane in an attempt to help secure an insurance package that
would support the project, the report said.
   ``We must conclude that Mr. Meese, in certain instances involving
Mr. Wallach, either did not understand, or did not appreciate, or
simply did not care what impression could be left with the public
about his own integrity and the integrity of those functions he
oversaw,'' the report said.
   Meese said last July he had been ``completely vindicated'' by the
decision of independent counsel James C. McKay not to seek an
indictment against him. McKay found Meese had probably violated
federal conflict-of-interest and tax laws, but he said prosecution
was not appropriate.
   ``We trust that this analysis will lay to rest the claims by Mr.
Meese that the appropriate standard for official behavior is whether
an independent counsel seeks an official's indictment,'' the Justice
Department report said.
   ``We found that the independent counsel's report far from
vindicates Mr. Meese; rather, it details conduct which should not be
tolerated of any government employee, especially not the attorney
general of the United States.''
   The investigators said that if Meese were still attorney general,
``we would recommend (to the next ranking department official) that
the president take disciplinary action.'' It did not specify what
action would be appropriate.
   The Justice Department said in a statement that because Meese is
no longer associated with the department, no further disciplinary
action is warranted in connection with matters raised in the report.
   In a statement, the department said Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh has reviewed and accepted the report and considers the
matter closed.
   Thornburgh addressed the portion of the report that found that
Meese had violated the executive order and the department's
standards of conduct by participating in matters involving the Bell
companies while holding stock in them.
   ``It appears to me that Mr. Meese's failure to fully dispose of
his financial interest in the regional Bell operating companies
resulted from a failure to obtain or act upon adequate legal advice
rather than an intent to violate ethical standards,'' said
Thornburgh.
   Meese's accountant, John McKean, suggested that no mention of the
securities sales should be made on the tax return because the
information necessary to detail the stock sales could not be
located. Meese finally filed the information early last year after a
grand jury began looking into it as part of McKay's criminal
investigation of Meese.
   In a 16-page statement prepared in response to the report,
Meese's lawyers contend that ``there is absolutely no basis for
criticizing his conduct,'' and term the report ``a travesty of
justice.''
   The report said Meese's ``actions were inconsistent with the
highest standards which the American people demand of not only every
other attorney in the department, but especially the attorney
general who must set the highest standard of behavior for the
department and for the government.''
   Contents of the 61-page report were first disclosed by The
Washington Post in Tuesday editions.
   Meese left the administration last summer to join two
conservative research organizations.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan soldiers used clubs and tree
branches to flail cold, hungry people who nearly engulfed Soviet
troopers distributing emergency rations in this blockaded city
Tuesday.
   The blockade by Moslem insurgents, who have fought the communist
regime for a decade, has created acute shortages as the remaining
50,000 Red Army troops withdraw from Afghanistan before the Feb. 15
deadline set in a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   A woman was pushed to the icy ground. An Afghan trooper with a
rifle under his arm punched and kicked a group of teen-agers when
the crowd of about 1,000 ignored repeated orders from the Soviet
soldiers, shouting through megaphones, to move back.
   Some Afghan soldiers even swung blankets at men, women and
children who broke from waiting lines and pressed toward Soviet
armored personnel carriers that rolled into the rundown Khairkhana
district near the airport with emergency supplies of fuel.
   Five Red Army soldiers in fur hats were in each personnel
carrier, and they appeared ill at ease. Some sat staring at the
crowd from their vehicles, which were armed with 75mm cannons
pointed skyward, while others poured fuel into containers held up by
people at the front of the line.
   Soviet soldiers made a similar distribution last week, but the
small amounts will be of little help.
   ``I have nothing now, my house is cold, my children are hungry,''
said a woman who identified herself as Aziza, a 35-year-old mother
of nine, and never got to the head of the line.
   A woman whose face was totally veiled, according to strict Moslem
practice, held out her hands to a Western reporter and said: ``My
children are hungry, I am hungry. This is because the rebels are not
letting supplies in.''
   Children as young as 8 joined lines waiting for bread outside
shack-like private bakeries in other parts of the capital, shivering
in predawn temperaturs far below freezing.
   Lines of buses and cars waiting for gasoline or diesel fuel
stretched around entire blocks in downtown Kabul.
   Western aid officials expressed alarm at the plight of
malnourished children waiting for bread in frigid temperatures. They
said the government wheat silo for supplying private bakeries, which
holds 50,000 tons and usually has a 40 percent reserve, was
virtually empty.
   Severe shortages began earlier this month when Soviet forces
started pulling out of the city and handing over convoy stations on
the Solang highway, the vital route north, to the government's
unreliable conscript army. A particuarly bitter winter exacerbates
the lack of daily necessities.
   As the crowd struggled toward the Soviet supplies, giant
Ilyushin-76 transport planes took off reguarly from the airport, a
daily occurrence as the withdrawal deadline approaches.
   Afghans generally have been hostile to the Soviet presence during
the long civil war, but some said Tuesday they wanted the Red Army
to stay, if that meant getting some supplies.
   Soviet soldiers arrived in December 1979 and began leaving May
15, 1988, under the withdrawal accord. They helped government forces
combat the Moslem guerrillas who began fighting after a communist
coup in April 1978, and an estimated 115,000 were in Afghanistan
when the agreement was signed.
   No political settlement is in sight and the Soviets have promised
to continue arming Afghan forces against the insurgents, who were
not a party to the withdrawal agreement and have continued fighting.
They are supported by the United States and Pakistan, Afghanistan's
eastern neighbor.
   Unconfirmed reports circulated Tuesday that the Afghan army,
which usually gets its grain supplies from the Soviets, had been
buying wheat on the private market.
   Food prices have more than doubled in four weeks. Flour has gone
from 850 afghans, the national currency, for about 15 pounds to
1,700 afghans in a nation whose people earn an average of about 300
afghans a month.
   One U.S. dollar buys 50 afghans at the official rate and 200 on
the black market flourishing in Kabul's bazaars.
   An Afghan doctor said there were no more of the special ration
coupons that protected government employees against previous
shortages.
   UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, reported attendance at its
health clinics down by nearly half because, mothers said, they and
their children could not leave the food and fuel lines.
   ``This is not an African famine situations but it is a very bad
situaton,'' said Vincent O'Reilly, the Irishman in charge of the
small UNICEF mission.

<HEAD>Bush Foresees Better U.S.-Iran Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a moment of standstill and silence in U.S.
contacts with Iran, President-elect Bush says he can visualize a day
of better relations _ a comment he hopes may help ``unlock the
locks'' that bind nine American hostages.
   Bush spoke in general terms, saying that a time of change in
administrations also can be a time of change in troubled
relationships abroad.
   ``I don't start off with the view that we always have to be at
loggerheads with Iran,'' the president-elect said in a recent
interview with The Associated Press.
   He said Iran also could take steps, beginning with the hostage
impasse, to demonstrate a desire for better ties with Washington.
   Bush becomes president on Friday, eight years almost to the hour
from the release of the 52 U.S. Embassy hostages who were held in
Tehran for 444 days and freed when President Reagan took office.
Jimmy Carter's final days as president were marked by intense,
indirect negotiations with Iran for the release of those captives.
   That history has given rise to speculation about the possible
release of American hostages in Lebanon as Bush succeeds Reagan. The
militant Shi'ite Moslem kidnappers are aligned with Iran, and a
State Department official said Tehran can control their fate.
   ``There was a lot of speculation back in October and November
that the hostages might be freed, because of the parallel at the end
of the Carter administration,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. But he said there have been no openings and
no negotiations like those eight years ago.
   Nor have there been talks on Reagan's offer to pay compensation
to the families of 290 people killed on July 3, when a U.S. warship
shot down an Iran Air jetliner over the Persian Gulf.
   Vice President Bush went to the United Nations to present the
U.S. case that the passenger plane was downed after being mistaken
for a warplane. At the Security Council, he called it a `terrible
human tragedy,'' but said Iran shares responsibility because the
civilian plane was sent on a path over a warship engaged in combat.
   Bush and his high command intend to stand on a policy that rules
out paying a price for release of American hostages, on the ground
that if kidnapping is seen as a profitable venture, U.S. citizens
around the world will be put at risk.
   That was Reagan policy, too, but the administration shipped arms
to Iran to try to gain hostages' release. Three Americans were freed
in Lebanon during the arms deal period of 1985 and 1986.
   Nine Americans and seven citizens of other nations are held
hostage in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press, is the American held longest; he was
kidnapped by gunmen on March 15, 1985.
   While State Department analysts believe Iran controls the hostage
situation, Bush said in the interview that while Tehran clearly has
influence, he is not certain that that government has full control.
   Bush said that as president he will be ``alert to opportunity''
to gain freedom for hostages, leaving no trail unexplored. ``I'm one
who thinks that some day we will have better relations with Iran,''
he said. ``And I'm one who thinks it's in our interest to have
better relations with Iran. And I'm one who thinks that Iran can
take a handful of steps and demonstrate that they want better
relations with the United States.
   ``And so to the degree Iran holds the key, holds most of the keys
to unlock the locks, that could be helpful,'' the president-elect
said.
   But Bush said he does not hold ``the naive view that if you have
some dramatic meeting, that's going to result in the instant release
of hostages who are not held by Iran and in some instances may be
held by clients of Iran.''
   Bush said his interview comments visualizing better relations
would send a message to Iran _ ``They'll read this, they know me ...
they know our administration.''
   But Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi discounted the Bush
comments, calling them an effort to justify U.S. policy. At a news
conference in Rome on Tuesday, Musavi repeated Tehran's insistance
that the hostage issue is an ``internal question of Lebanon,'' not
one for Iran.

   Security officials have detained at least
200 people in the southeast in the past two weeks on charges of
collaborating with Kurdish guerrillas, officials said Tuesday.
   Fuat Atalay, a deputy from the main opposition Social Democrat
Populist Party, told The Associated Press that more than 200 people
of Kurdish origin had been detained in the province of Diyarbakir.
   Other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about 200
others were rounded up in nearby Siirt province.
   Kurdish guerrillas operating in the southeast are affiliated with
the Kurdish Labor Party, which seeks to establish a Marxist state in
parts of southeastern and eastern Turkey.
   About 800 civilians and military personnel and an equal number of
Kurdish rebels have been killed since the party began attacking
military targets and villages in 1984. Ethnic Kurds make up about
one-fifth of Turkey's population of 55 million.

<TEXT>
   On Friday Ronald Reagan becomes the 32nd former
president of the United States, posing anew the question of how _ or
whether _ the nation can use the experience of its former chief
executives.
   The country has no formal structure for doing so, but former
President Harry F. Truman thought he had an idea.
   In his memoirs, ``Mr. Citizen,'' Truman proposed that former
presidents be made non-voting ``Free members of the Congress.''
   ``The former president, of course, could not be expected to sit
still, just waiting to be called on for an expression of opinion,''
Truman said. ``More often he would want to speak up on matters which
he might deem necessary to bring to the attention of the Congress.''
   ``Arguments and debate are what make a free government and a
former president could be counted on to stimulate and even provoke
debate,'' the former president said.
   It would, said Truman, ``stop the waste of a vast storehouse of
experince'' and, to some extent, ``help bridge a certain gap in the
continuity of our government.''
   Although Truman's suggestion was never adopted, it was in marked
contrast with the tongue-in-cheek proposal offered by former
President William Howard Taft.
   Ex-presidents, said the ex-president, should be chloroformed and
ceremonially cremated immediately after leaving office.
   This, said Taft, would ``fix his place in history and enable the
public to pass on to new men and new measures.''
   Taft ignored his own view, and instead had one of history's most
distinguished and satisfying post-presidential careers, becoming
chief justice.
   There were times, he remarked, when he could hardly remember ever
having been president at all.
   Of course the first president to attach ``former'' to his title
was George Washington.
   ``Perhaps the most important decision ever made concerning an
ex-president was Washington's decision to become one,'' wrote John
Whiteclay Chambers in American Heritage magazine in 1979.
``Conceivably, he might have stayed in office until he died,
establishing a far different tradition than the voluntary
relinquishing of power.''
   Ever since Washington retired to the life of a gentleman farmer,
former presidents have sometimes been called on for their expertise
_ and sometimes ignored altogether.
   Grover Cleveland became a former president twice, having won the
office for a second non-consecutive term after a four-year time out.
Eight presidents died in office, never achieving the status of
ex-president.
   The second president, John Adams, became a virtual political
exile. But his son, John Qunicy Adams, won election to the House of
Representatives after his presidency and served 17 years.
   Three former presidents sought the presidency again and failed.
   Truman, determined to end 20 years of neglect, reached out to
former Republican President Herbert Hoover twice, naming him first
to get food to hungry people after World War II, then to head a
commission that recommended ways to streamline the government.
   The Former Presidents Act of 1958 granted ex-presidents an annual
income and authorized them to hire a staff and operate from a suite
of offices furnished at government expense. It granted ex-presidents
free mailing privileges. And it provided a pension for presidential
widows.
   In 1963, Congress also granted former presidents transition funds
to be used in the first six months after leaving office.
   After President John F. Kennedy was assasinated in 1963, Congress
granted all former presidents Secret Service protection.
   And in 1969 a townhouse on Lafayette Square near the White House
was set aside for the use of former presidents visiting the capital.
   Nearly all recent former presidents have written books,
justifying their conduct in office or offering ideas and proposals.
   Hoover opened the first presidential library, and all of his
successors have followed his example.
   All of this provides a base for sharing that wealth of experience
of which Truman spoke. Several recent presidents have.
   Richard Nixon, struggling to emerge from the Watergate cloud that
forced his resignation as president, has written several books of
foreign policy advice.
   Jimmy Carter has engaged in campaigns to improve world health and
human rights conditions. Through his hands-on carpenter's work with
Habitat for Humanity, he has campaigned for decent housing for the
poor. He has also written several books, including one on Middle
East policy.
   And this year Gerald R. Ford, teaming with Carter, issued a
detailed volume of advice to the next president, including the
warning that there may be no other way to eliminate the federal
budget deficit but to raise taxes.

   Police remained puzzled by how she managed to get to Heathrow
airport and board a plane, apparently without money or a passport,

the decorations and pay for insurance coverage.
   Because of the lack of funds, the chamber's board voted against
renewing a contract to have a Fresno-area firm store the green and

<HEAD>Bush Foresees Better U.S.-Iran Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a moment of standstill and silence in U.S.
contacts with Iran, President-elect Bush says he can visualize a day
of better relations _ a comment he hopes may help ``unlock the
locks'' that bind nine American hostages.
   Bush spoke in general terms, saying that a time of change in
administrations also can be a time of change in troubled
relationships abroad.
   ``I don't start off with the view that we always have to be at
loggerheads with Iran,'' the president-elect said in a recent
interview with The Associated Press.
   He said Iran also could take steps, beginning with the hostage
impasse, to demonstrate a desire for better ties with Washington.
   Bush becomes president on Friday, eight years almost to the hour
from the release of the 52 U.S. Embassy hostages who were held in
Tehran for 444 days and freed when President Reagan took office.
Jimmy Carter's final days as president were marked by intense,
indirect negotiations with Iran for the release of those captives.
   That history has given rise to speculation about the possible
release of American hostages in Lebanon as Bush succeeds Reagan. The
militant Shi'ite Moslem kidnappers are aligned with Iran, and a
State Department official said Tehran can control their fate.
   ``There was a lot of speculation back in October and November
that the hostages might be freed, because of the parallel at the end
of the Carter administration,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. But he said there have been no openings and
no negotiations like those eight years ago.
   Nor have there been talks on Reagan's offer to pay compensation
to the families of 290 people killed on July 3, when a U.S. warship
shot down an Iran Air jetliner over the Persian Gulf.
   Vice President Bush went to the United Nations to present the
U.S. case that the passenger plane was downed after being mistaken
for a warplane. At the Security Council, he called it a `terrible
human tragedy,'' but said Iran shares responsibility because the
civilian plane was sent on a path over a warship engaged in combat.
   Bush and his high command intend to stand on a policy that rules
out paying a price for release of American hostages, on the ground
that if kidnapping is seen as a profitable venture, U.S. citizens
around the world will be put at risk.
   That was Reagan policy, too, but the administration shipped arms
to Iran to try to gain hostages' release. Three Americans were freed
in Lebanon during the arms deal period of 1985 and 1986.
   Nine Americans and seven citizens of other nations are held
hostage in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press, is the American held longest; he was
kidnapped by gunmen on March 15, 1985.
   While State Department analysts believe Iran controls the hostage
situation, Bush said in the interview that while Tehran clearly has
influence, he is not certain that that government has full control.
   Bush said that as president he will be ``alert to opportunity''
to gain freedom for hostages, leaving no trail unexplored. ``I'm one
who thinks that some day we will have better relations with Iran,''
he said. ``And I'm one who thinks it's in our interest to have
better relations with Iran. And I'm one who thinks that Iran can
take a handful of steps and demonstrate that they want better
relations with the United States.
   ``And so to the degree Iran holds the key, holds most of the keys
to unlock the locks, that could be helpful,'' the president-elect
said.
   But Bush said he does not hold ``the naive view that if you have
some dramatic meeting, that's going to result in the instant release
of hostages who are not held by Iran and in some instances may be
held by clients of Iran.''
   Bush said his interview comments visualizing better relations
would send a message to Iran _ ``They'll read this, they know me ...
they know our administration.''
   But Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi discounted the Bush
comments, calling them an effort to justify U.S. policy. At a news
conference in Rome on Tuesday, Musavi repeated Tehran's insistance
that the hostage issue is an ``internal question of Lebanon,'' not
one for Iran.

   Most Americans believe there's enough romance in

romance out of marriage, according to a poll released Tuesday by
Parents magazine.
   In a national survey of adults, 70 percent of respondents said
they had enough romance in their lives. Twenty-three percent said
they had too little romance, and an intriguing 3 percent claimed to
have more than they could handle.
   As far as children and marriage, 57 percent termed it a myth that
the combination kills romance. But 39 percent said they felt that
when a child arrives, Cupid leaves.
   The telephone poll, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points, was conducted in September and October.
Sixty-five percent of the respondents were married.

   Yasser Arafat has accepted an invitation to
address Arab-Americans in Washington, says a Detroit attorney who
met with the PLO leader in Tunisia, but such a visit could pose a
dilemma for the Bush administration.
   Attorney and American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee
President Abdeen Jabara, who met with Arafat last weekend, said the
Palestine Liberation Organization leader has agreed to address the
group April 13 at its convention in Washington.
   However, the State Department on Monday refused to say whether
Arafat would be allowed to enter the United States.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that ``we
haven't received a visa request yet. We will consider it very
carefully. We won't say in advance what we'll do.''
   Denying Arafat a visa could anger Arab leaders who consider the
PLO a key part of the push for peace in the Middle East. Issuing the
visa could anger Israel and its supporters.
   ``There is a dilemma,'' said Sol Lachman, a former president of
the Detroit chapter of the American Zionist Federation. ``Even as a
supporter of Israel, I can understand why the U.S. would want to
talk to the PLO, and why it's completely appropriate to serve as an
intermediary in the cause of peace.
   ``But Arafat in Washington? To deal with him on that basis is to
legitimize him, who was a terrorist up until last month.''
   Last November, Secretary of State George Shultz rejected Arafat's
application for a visa to address the United Nations, citing the
Palestinian leader's support of terrorism.
   But in December, the United States agreed to renew talks with the
PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism and endorsed UN resolutions
recognizing Israel's right to exist.
   The April speech would ``be recorded as an historic event in the
relations between Americans of Arab descent and the Palestinian
leadership,'' Jabara said in a statement from Tunisia.
   ``The granting of a visa to the PLO chairman will not only be a
gesture of good will toward the 2 million Americans of Arab descent,
but would also underline the new administration's commitment to
resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict within the framework of
free and open discussion of all parties.''
   Terry Ahwal, chief of the group's Detroit office, said Monday the
issuance of a visa would demonstrate the commitment of
Arab-Americans to peace in the war-torn West Bank.
   ``(Arafat) is an important figure to Palestinians, obviously, but
to other Arab-Americans as well,'' Ahwal said.
   The largest chapter of Jabara's group is in Detroit.

<TEXT>
   The long-delayed launch debuts of two
new military space rockets, the Delta 2 and Titan 4, should occur
within two months as the Air Force prepares for what could be the
busiest launch year here since 1983, an official said Tuesday.
   The commander of the Eastern Space and Missile Center, Air Force
Col. Lawrence L. Gooch, said the Delta 2, carrying a pair of
military navigation satellites, is set for liftoff Feb. 7, with the
Titan 4, which will be America's most powerful unmanned rocket, to
follow within a few weeks.
   Gooch told reporters the current schedule for 1989 calls for
seven Delta 2s, two commercial Delta 2s and one Delta 1; two Titan
4s, two smaller Titan 34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; two
commercial Atlas-Centaurs and one with a Navy communications
satellite, and six to eight submarine test launches of the Navy's
powerful new Trident 2 nuclear missiles.
   In addition, the missile center will support seven NASA space
shuttle launchings during 1989, starting with Discovery on Feb. 23.
   The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since
1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987.
   But launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold down
the total, Gooch said. ``With luck we could support that rate, but
if we can get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.''
   The Air Force decided to build the Delta 2 and to greatly
increase its Titan 4 order following the explosion of space shuttle
Challenger in 1986.
   Both the Pentagon and NASA had been phasing out unmanned rockets
and putting all launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle. After
Challenger, officials realized this was a mistake and they ordered
expendable rockets to give the nation assured access to space.
   Gooch estimated that 40 space payloads have backed up, waiting
for a rocket ride, as a result of the 32-month shuttle standdown
after the shuttle accident and because of the grounding of the Titan
34D for several months after back-to-back failures in 1885 and 1986.
About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense, he said.
   Gooch said the range may have problems supporting the schedule if
there are delays in a lot of the missions.
   Citing the Trident 2 submarine launches, the first of which is
scheduled in about two months, he said, ``If you have a Trident sub
at sea, and it comes in here for demonstration firings, that's a lot
of resources and involves a national defense commitment.''
   In most cases, the Trident launch probably would have priority
over all except the most critical defense satellite launches.
   The maiden launch of the Delta 2 already has been delayed six
months and the debut of the Titan 4 about five months by problems
preparing the new rockets and their refurbished launch pads.
   Another problem, Gooch said, could be a shortage of manpower to
support launches. He said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100
skilled people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations
group.

<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said Tuesday he
wants to meet soon with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to end 40
years of enmity between the nations.
   South Korea is preparing a ``realistic'' proposal to reunite the
two Koreas by seeing North Korea as ``a partner that also seeks to
solve this problem,'' Roh said at a wide-ranging news conference.
   The leaders of the nations have never met, and the two sides
technically are still at war since a peace treaty was not signed at
the end of the Korean War in 1953.
   North Korea agreed Monday to a South Korean proposal that would
allow their prime ministers to lead political and military talks on
reducing tensions. Those talks would be the highest level of contact
since the war.
   ``Besides clearing the way for trade and exchanges between South
and North Korea, I will realize inter-Korean summit talks in the
near future and achieve epoch-making progress in resolving the
Korean question,'' Roh said.
   The president said recent developments indicated North Korea also
wants reconciliation, but he could not give details on efforts to
arrange a summit.
   Roh, outlining his administration's plans for 1989, said his
government would continue trying to build democracy and ensure
continued economic growth to raise living standards.
   But, he said, violent anti-government radicals threaten the
nation's political stability.
   ``Radical fringes are attempting to overthrow our free society
and democratic order through violence,'' Roh said. ``Stern action
will be taken to check violent activities intended to topple our
democratic society.''
   His warning was directed at dissidents and radical students who
have mounted violent anti-government protests demanding the
overthrow of Roh's government. The radicals, who claim Roh is a
front for military rule, have little public support and their
protests often are small.
   Roh appealed to South Koreans to foster political stability. He
said the transition to democracy since the end of former President
Chun Doo-hwan's authoritarian government had exposed and aggravated
many problems.
   ``Desires that have long been suppressed have erupted all at
once. Discord and discontent among different social strata ... have
been dredged up to expose the accumulated problems of our society,''
he said.
   The Roh government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms
since major anti-government protests in June 1987 forced the Chun
government to agree to elections and brought an end to repression.
   Roh also promised to continue South Korea's efforts to establish
ties with the Soviet Union, China and other communist nations.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their creation in
1948 after U.S. and Soviet troops ended the Japanese occupation at
the end of World War II. The North invaded the South in 1950,
starting the Korean War, and the sides have clashed repeatedly over
the years.
   Roh said the 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty must remain until peace is achieved on the
divided peninsula. Radicals demanded removal of U.S. forces.
   Roh, who took office in February, said he will keep his election
promise to hold a referendum on his performance. He said he will
choose an ``appropriate'' time and method for the referendum.
   His government also was trying to investigate corruption and
other abuses committed under Chun's government, Roh said.
   But he repeated his opposition to punishing the former president,
saying it would be ``political retaliation.''
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into rural exile in November after apologizing to the
nation for corruption and human-rights abuses during his rule.
Several of Chun's relatives and former aides have been convicted or
charged with embezzlement and other crimes.
   The opposition-controlled National Assembly is demanding that
Chun testify before lawmakers investigating misdeeds, but Roh is
trying to block the demand.

<TEXT>
   Newspaper heiress Patty Hearst Shaw says
she's not sure whether President Reagan's recent expression of
interest in her request for a pardon means one will be forthcoming.
   ``I don't know,'' she said during a brief interview Monday with
The Advocate of Stamford at her Westport home. ``It's a little
premature for anything like that. If he (Reagan) doesn't approve it,
it would go to the next administration.''
   Shaw, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst,
last August quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the 1974
robbery of a bank.
   She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical Symbionese
Liberation Army, a group of self-styled revolutionaries who abducted
her in Berkeley, Calif., in February 1974 and orchestrated the bank
heist.
   Shaw was convicted of charges connected with the bank robbery and
sentenced to seven years in prison. Her sentence was commuted by
Reagan's predecessor, President Jimmy Carter and she was released
from prison on Feb. 1, 1979, after serving 23 months.
   Reagan, who leaves office Friday, said Sunday that he had ``asked
everybody to look into this for me.'' He did not elaborate. A pardon
would not erase Shaw's criminal record.
   Shaw, now 34, is married and living in Westport with her husband
and two daughters.

   Bail was set at $2 million today for a
Korean-American businessman arrested in an alleged plot to export
deadly nerve gas, possibly to Iran.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald Hedges also imposed strict travel
restrictions and limited overseas contacts for Juwhan Yun, 49, of
Short Hills, as conditions of his release.
   Yun was arrested Thursday on charges that he conspired to violate
the Arms Export Control Act. He was held without bail pending
today's hearing.
   New details of the case emerged during the hearing.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer disclosed that Yun also had
sought to acquire ``state-of-the-art'' machine guns that fire
grenades.
   The government said previously that Yun had negotiated with an
undercover U.S. Customs Service agent posing as an arms dealer over
seven months for the nerve gas sarin along with missiles and
military radar parts.
   Yun ``bragged that he had close personal contacts with
high-ranking civilian and military officials in many countries,''
including Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of China and South
Korea, said Singer.
   The government last week said the weapons may have been for
export to Iran.

   Theodore Bundy, the serial killer called ``a
diabolical genius'' by one judge, faces death in Florida's electric
chair next week after losing a Supreme Court appeal Tuesday.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, rejected arguments that Bundy, 42,
was mentally incompetent when he stood trial in 1980 for the slaying
of a 12-year-old girl in Lake City, Fla.
   Within an hour of the high court's action, Florida officials said
Bundy would be executed Tuesday at 7 a.m. under a death warrant
signed by Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Bundy has also received death sentences for the 1978 killings of
two Florida State University sorority sisters who were beaten and
strangled just three weeks before the Lake City murder.
   He has been linked to as many as 36 sex murders or disappearances
of young women, most of them in Utah, Colorado and Washington state.
   Bundy, whose case was depicted in a television miniseries named
``The Deliberate Stranger,'' previously has come within hours of
being executed only to win postponement.
   Tuesday's order marked the fourth time the Supreme Court has
considered a formal appeal involving one of his convictions or death
sentences.
   ``We hope justice can now be served in this case,'' Florida
Attorney General Robert Butterworth said.
   After signing the death warrant, Martinez called Bundy ``one of
the most notorious killers in our nation's history'' who ``has used
legal manueverings to dodge the electric chair for 10 years.''
   ``Justice has been on hold for a decade,'' Martinez said, ``and
it's about time Ted Bundy paid for his crimes.''
   But James Coleman Jr., one of the Washington lawyers representing
Bundy, said, ``We will seek to stay the execution, ... perhaps as
early as tomorrow.''
   Coleman said he planned to file an emergency appeal in Florida
state court. ``If we do not win a stay in the state courts, I expect
we will be back in federal court,'' he said, declining to disclose
what legal theory would be advanced.
   In the appeal acted on Tuesday, lawyers for Bundy argued that
lower courts wrongly determined at a much later date that he had
been competent to stand trial in 1980 for the 1978 killing of
Kimberly Leach.
   Referring to numerous incidents in which Bundy exhibited bizarre
behavior during his trial, the appeal maintained that Bundy had been
mentally incompetent at the time.
   ``This court has never addressed the issue of when, if ever, a
(post-trial)hearing would be adequate to remedy a violation of a
defendant's right ... to a contemporary determination of his
competency when sufficient (indications) arise at trial,'' the
appeal said.
   The Supreme Court in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a
``contemporary'' competency hearing.
   A federal judge in 1986 ruled that Bundy had been competent in
1980, calling him ``the most competent serial killer in the country
at this time ... a diabolical genius.''
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the competency
ruling.
   The Leach girl disappeared from a junior high school on Feb. 9,
1978. Her body was found in an abandoned pig sty.
   Prosecutors said that on the night of Jan. 15, 1978, Bundy
entered a Chi Omega sorority house on the Florida State campus and
attacked four coeds, killing two and seriously injuring two.
   Margaret Bowman and Lisa Levy, attacked as they slept, were
killed.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose
capital punishment under all circumstances, voted to overturn
Bundy's death sentence.
   In other matters Tuesday, the court:
   _Turned down the appeals of four California death row inmates,
including a man linked to the sex slayings of four boys in
California, Texas, West Virginia and New Jersey.
   _Ruled, by a 6-3 vote, that a California redistricting plan that
placed Democrats in firm control of the state's congressional
delegation is not an unlawful form of political gerrymandering.
   _Let stand a ruling in a case from Boston that allows
anti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette company's
research that the groups say could link smoking to health hazards.
   _Rejected a challenge to a Virginia law exempting religiously
affiliated child-care centers from some health and safety
regulations all other child-care centers must meet.

   A mild earthquake rattled Northern
California's coast, but there were no reports of injuries or damage,
officials said.
   The temblor struck at 9:05 p.m. Monday and was centered 15 miles
east of Arcata, about 220 miles north of San Francisco, the state
Office of Emergency Services said.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
measured the quake at 3.4 on the Richter Scale.
   Early today, another minor earthquake jolted parts of Seattle and
its eastern suburbs.
   The 5:55 a.m. temblor registered 3.3 on the Richter scale, said
Chris Jonientz-Trisler, seismic analyst with the University of
Washington.
   Late last week, about 10 small quakes, the largest registering
2.2, were recorded beneath Mercer Island in Lake Washington, east of
Seattle. The temblors were widely felt in Kirkland and other suburbs
east of the city.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area.

<HEAD>Armenian Party Officials Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 49 Communist Party and government
officials in the republic of Armenia have been fired or expelled
from the party, some for fostering nationalism or blackmail, the
party newspaper Pravda said Tuesday.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who heads a commission of the
ruling Politburo charged with coordinating relief efforts from the
Dec. 7 Armenian earthquake, was scheduled to attend a meeting of the
Armenian party's Central Committee on Tuesday night, the official
Tass news agency said.
   That body's Politburo has been reviewing the activities of
Armenian Communist Party in line with a Dec. 15 decree from the
party's Moscow-based Central Committee.
   Ethnic tensions have been running high in Armenia since February,
when activists launched their drive for the annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region that has been part of the
neighboring republic of Azerbaijan since 1923.
   More than 60 people have been killed in riots and violence
between Armenians, who are mostly Christians, and the predominantly
Moslem Azerbaijanis. The Kremlin leadership rejected the Armenian
demands, instead putting Nagorno-Karabakh under the direct control
of Moscow.
   The Central Committee's decree directs party leaders in Armenia
and Azerbaijan to penalize officials who committed illegal acts in
connection with the ethnic dispute.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, said many high-ranking
Armenian officials had fueled the strife by their indecisiveness,
and implied they might have been involved in the annexation movement
itself.
   In all 68 persons received rebukes from the Armenian party's
Politburo, Pravda said. In addition, 13 executives were expelled
from party ranks, and 36 officials in the party, government, police
and economic management were fired, Pravda said.
   The Armenian Politburo charged the officials with destabilizing
the situation in the southern Soviet Union and kindling nationalist
dissension through indecisiveness, passivity, and negligence, Pravda
said.
   The paper also reported officials had violated citizens'
constitutional rights by resorting to threats and blackmail. It did
not specify what acts had occurred.
   The Armenian Politburo singled out two local party bosses for
negligence and the absence of political leadership that it said
caused deaths and massive emigration of the Azerbaijani population.
The bureau recommended official rebukes for Y. Chshmarityan of the
Stepanavansk region and D. Ananyan of the Idzhevansk region.
   According to Pravda, the bureau also recommended Armenian
Education Minister S. Akhumyan be rebuked for not maintaining order
in university classrooms.
   The Armenian Politburo also charged party officials with the task
of penalizing communists ``who indulge in the estrangement of people
by nationality, who allow extremist attacks or stir up nationalist
hostilities.''

<HEAD>Rule Proposed to Ease Rule on Imported Meat Carcasses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department on Tuesday proposed
a change in federal meat inspection regulations to allow importation
of slaughtered livestock carcasses with certain tissues removed.
   Current regulations require imported cascasses of cattle, sheep,
swine and goats to include internal tissues such as the pleura,
peritoneum and body or portal lymph nodes to help inspectors spot
disease or other abnormalities, said Lester M. Crawford,
administrator of the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   But these requirements began many years ago when foreign
countries' exporting practices were much different, he said.
   ``Today all countries which are certified as eligible to export
meat to the United States must have an inspection system that is
equal to ours,'' Crawford said. ``This means that the carcasses,
including these specific tissues, have already been inspected in
that country.''
   The proposal, which is in response to a petition from Cloverdale
Foods Co., Minot, N.D., will be open for public comment through Feb.
16. Comments can be sent to: Policy Office, Attn. Linda Carey, FSIS
Hearing Clerk, Room 3171-S, USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

   When disc jockeys gather to share their
horror stories about sore throats or giving the wrong call letters,
Daryl Berryhill probably will have the topper.
   Berryhill, the 19-year-old late-night DJ for KKRQ-FM, stepped
outside to get a snack from his car at about 2:40 a.m. Monday and
found that the station door had locked behind him.
   After the last song ended, there was 45 minutes of silence.
   A friend of Berryhill's, who arrived just after the lockout,
called the sheriff's office. By the time deputies arrived, Berryhill
had broken glass in one back door and pried open a security cage,
but had been unable to open a second set of doors leading to the
studio.
   To add injury to insult, he cut himself on the broken glass.
   As broadcasting pitfalls go, ``It's one of the worst,'' said
KKRQ's morning personality Ted Burton Jacobson. Still, he said, it
could happen to anybody.
   ``Maybe the next time he gets hungry, he'll get somebody to
deliver,'' Jacobson said.

   Next thing you know, Mayor Fred Wacha will
be handing out physics tests at City Council meetings.
   It hasn't reached that point yet, but consider Wacha's position:
All four councilmen and the city clerk were once students of his at
Clarkson High School, where he's been a teacher for 30 years.
   Wacha, a science teacher, began his mayoral duties in 1984 andmes A.
Baker III.
   The plan calls for increased lending by commercial banks to Latin
America in return for economic restructuring but lending levels
since 1985 have been far below expectations.
   A month ago, President-elect Bush indicated he will undertake a
major review of U.S. policy toward Third World debt because of the
``enormous problems'' facing Latin America.
   On Central America, the report called on the United States to end
its diplomatic boycott of the Sandinista government and bilaterally
negotiate mutual security arrangements. Saying ``there can be no
double standard,'' the report also argued that Managua must ``desist
from assisting insurgencies in El Salvador and elsewhere.''
   On drug trafficking, the report said that action to reduce demand
for narcotics ``must be given overriding emphasis'' in the struggle
against drugs.
   ``As long as there is a demand for illicit drugs, supplies will
find their way to it,'' the report said.

   The nation's capital will be trying to cover a
ragged image with its Sunday best when the nation turns its eyes
this way for the inauguration of George Bush.
   Police spokesman Lt. Reginald Smith said officers would be
working to keep the streets clear of crime and vice while Washington
is full of visitors celebrating the installation of a new president.
   ``We're going to intensify our efforts to abate many of the
nuisances throughout the city,'' said Smith, specifically mentioning
increased efforts against prostitution and drug sales.
   Washington's facade, with its historic monuments and powerful
residents, has cracked lately.
   The festivities come at a time when the city is dismayed by its
murder rate _ 371 slayings last year, mostly due to drug wars _ and
embarrassed by its mayor, Marion Barry, the subject of two
investigations recently into his social ties with people who were
the subjects of drug probes.
   ``Much has been said about the mayor and the city's image,''
William Sinclair, the new president of the Greater Washington Board
of Trade, said recently. ``Obviously, in the short term, this
doesn't help (business in the district).''
   The federal government has provided the D.C. Inaugural Committee
with $2.3 million to pay for police and fire protection, medical and
ambulance service, traffic control, supervision of construction of
stands along the parade route, food inspection and issuance of
``official inaugural maps,'' according to Cecilia Perry of the
Office of Emergency Preparedness.
   Ms. Perry said the city had made no plans to shove its homeless
residents out of sight. Estimates of their numbers run from 7,500 to
twice that figure.
   ``There's nothing that can be done,'' she said. ``It
(homelessness) is a problem in the city. They have a right to watch
the parade just like everyone else.''
   But homeless-rights activist Mitch Snyder, whose Community for
Creative Non-Violence operates a shelter three blocks from the
inaugural parade route, said police usually force the homeless out
of sight by threatening to drive them far from town and leave them
there.
   ``It happened to me in 1980,'' Snyder said. ``I was homeless.
Police came by about 5:30 in the morning and said, `If you're not
off this grate within half an hour, we'll take you somewhere and
drop you off.' Most people realize what the police want. They want
you to drop from sight. So you do.''
   ``It's fairly common for homeless people to be hassled by police
and by other officials on the street, told to move on, told that
they're loitering, told that they are not to be there,'' said Maria
Foscarinis, counsel for the National Coalition for the Homeless.
``It's not an unusual experience for homeless people. And what
happens around times like inauguration is that those kinds of
methods are greatly stepped up.''
   At inauguration time in January 1985, image issues took a back
seat to the homeless population's welfare because the district was
locked in a dangerous cold wave.
   City police denied any role in moving homeless people this year.
   About a dozen people, many of them homeless, demonstrate daily in
Lafayette Park across from the White House. Most of that park will
be used for media coverage of the inaugural events, according to
National Park Service spokeswoman Sandra Alley, but a section has
been set aside for protesters.
   U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Dan Nichols said homelessness isn't
a problem on the Capitol grounds, which encompass 180 acres of parks
and congressional office buildings.
   ``It's against the law to sleep in the Capitol grounds
outdoors,'' Nichols said, ``and homeless people are aware of that.''

   Five students were suspended for defying
their principal's order to end an unauthorized tribute to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
   The students said they recited King's works in the Franklin
Regional High School lobby Monday because administrators failed to
observe the civil rights leader's birthday with a student assembly
or a day off.
   The five, who are white, also said the curriculum in the
predominantly white school system in an affluent Pittsburgh suburb
does not include black history. There are only 10 blacks among the
840 high school students.
   ``Martin Luther King did not work just to give blacks their
rights. He wanted freedom for all men,'' said Leona Wahl, 17, a
senior and one of the demonstrators.
   The high school observed Martin Luther King Day with a moment of
silence at the beginning of the day, and administrators asked social
studies teachers to mention King in each class, school district
spokeswoman Judy Johnson said Tuesday.
   An estimated 15 students skipped their second-period class to
assemble in the lobby for the King tribute.
   Principal Richard Plutto took them into the auditorium and gave
them a choice between returning to classes or accepting three-day,
in-house suspensions, Mrs. Johnson said.
   The five students who rejected the principal's offer were
suspended, she said. ``We were really trying to do our very best to
... kind of agree to disagree,'' said Mrs. Johnson.
   Miss Wahl said she does not regret being suspended.
   ``If they want to do that, it's fine,'' she said. ``So long (as)
we get our point across.''

<TEXT>
   Morton Thiokol Inc. has postponed its
final full-scale test of the redesigned space shuttle booster a
third time, citing delays in the rocket's preparation.
   The test, the sixth and last to formally qualify major design
features of the 126-foot-long solid-fuel rocket, had been originally
set for Tuesday, then moved back to Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``The test is now set for Friday. There's no one main reason for
that, just an accumulation of minor delays that put us back a day,''
said Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
   On the two earlier postponements, the company said engineers had
requested more time to adequately chill the solid-fuel motor's 1.1
million pounds of propellant.
   While Friday's test is the last of six formal qualifying firings,
the redesigned booster already has been successfully used on two
shuttle launches Sept. 29 and Dec. 2. In both cases, the boosters
performed without a hitch.
   Raab said only five of the six scheduled test-firings, the last
of which was held Aug. 18, were required prior to launch.
   The final test is to determine how the rocket performs with
propellant cooled to 40 degrees Fahrenheit _ established by
engineers as the lowest operating temperature for the redesigned
booster, Raab said.
   NASA ordered the rocket redesigned after a presidential
commission blamed a faulty seal on one of the Challenger's boosters
for the spacecraft's Jan. 28, 1986, explosion that killed the seven
people aboard.

   The City Council today asked county
prosecutors to investigate the conduct of a white policeman who was
secretly filmed while he pushed an off-duty black policeman through
a plate-glass window.
   ``We're certainly not happy to have an incident like this
occurring, but we need all the information,'' said Councilman Thomas
J. Clark of the council's request for an investigation.
   Curt Livesay, an assisant Los Angeles County district attorney
and head of the office's Special Investigations Division, will lead
the probe, said district attorney spokesman Andy Reynolds.
   The black Hawthorne policeman, Sgt. Don Jackson, said he set up
the self-styled ``sting'' in Long Beach to expose alleged police
racism in the Los Angeles area.
   An NBC-TV news camera crew arranged to follow Jackson during the
sting Saturday night. The incident was broadcast on NBC's national
news Monday night.
   ``We've never been able to come forth before with enough evidence
(of alleged police racism). Now, it is brought to your living room
in living color,'' said Frank Berry, president of the Long Beach
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   The police chief in Long Beach declined to comment pending an
investigation. City officials promised a thorough inquiry.
   ``We will pursue it aggressively,'' said Long Beach City Manager
James Hanklad. ``If there is evidence of brutality, we will act
accordingly.''
   Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said on NBC's ``Today'' show this
morning that he was disturbed by the videotape.
   ``I ... do not support racism or police brutality, nor do the
vast majority of the citizens of Long Beach, and we're a caring,
thinking community and it disturbed us very much to see the tape,''
he said.
   Long Beach, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, has
about 450,000 people, including a sizeable black population.
   Jackson and a companion were driving through a high-crime area of
the city when their car was pulled over and Jackson got out.
   The NBC-TV videotape shows a white officer attempting to search
Jackson. The officer unleashed a stream of profanity and roughed up
Jackson after he demanded to know why he was being searched.
   The incident renewed calls for a citizen board to review the
Police Department. The idea first was debated last year amid
allegations of police brutality.
   But Jackson's boss said the black officer was looking for trouble.
   ``I submit that if Mr. Jackson had stayed in the vehicle, as did
the driver, this incident would not have occurred,'' Hawthorne
Police Chief Kenneth R. Stonebraker said at a news conference Monday.
   Since the incident apparently was timed by Jackson to coincide
with the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. the confrontation
should be considered ``nothing short of timed sensationalism at the
risk of serious injury to all of the parties involved,'' Stonebraker
said.
   ``As a police chief,'' he added, ``I do not for one minute
condone the unlawful use of force or police brutality.''
   The 30-year-old Jackson, who has been on a stress-related
disability leave from his Hawthorne job for 22 months, contends the
incident is typical of a pattern of racism by white officers in the
Los Angeles area.
   Jackson alleges racist slurs and actions forced him from the
Hawthorne department. He has a disability lawsuit pending, has filed
racism complaints against the department and conducted a similar
personal sting operation against Los Angeles police.
   Jackson was riding as a passenger with Jeffrey Hill, a
30-year-old off-duty state corrections officer, when they were
pulled over allegedly for straddling lanes, which they denied.
Jackson got out after the car stopped and police approached.
   During an argument, Long Beach Officer Mark Dickey ordered
Jackson to face a building and put his hands behind his head.
   Jackson complied, and moments later was pushed through a
plate-glass store window. ``I'm all right. OK, no problem,'' said
Jackson on the videotape.
   Police booked Jackson for investigation of interfering with
police and challenging a police officer. Hill was issued a traffic
citation.
   ``The officer simply used violence,'' Jackson said Monday.
   ``I already cooperated and told him he could search me,'' Jackson
said. ``I had already had my hands up and was turned to the window
and he slammed my face in it.''
   Jackson received support at a Monday night ceremony in Los
Angeles commemorating King's birthday.
   ``I'm deeply concerned since it strikes me as a period when
police violence and excessive force is rampant,'' said Mark
Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference's Los Angeles chapter.
   ``I'm more so offended since the Hawthorne Police Department,
which has no jurisdiction, is making judgment.''
   Jackson said he chose Long Beach police because of complaints to
the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles.
   David Lynn of the referral service said 50 misconduct complaints
were filed with his group against the Long Beach police. Of those,
27 were filed by minorities, and 24 of those involved confrontations
with white officers.

   The big winners in Congress under its planned
50 percent pay raise would be members who already refuse to accept
outside money, while the losers will be those who in the past earned
the most in outside fees.
   The reason is simple mathematics. Those who declined outside
income would receive the proposed $45,500 raise _ from $89,500 to
$135,000 _ without giving up anything in the tradeoff.
   But those who have been collecting outside fees would lose that
income, offsetting a large chunk of the raise.
   President Reagan has proposed the 50 percent increase for 2,498
people _ members of Congress, top federal executives and Cabinet
members. The proposal would become effective automatically unless
both houses of Congress vote it down by Feb. 8 _ something not
likely to happen.
   Lawmakers favoring the increase, however, have said they would
give up their outside fees if the raise goes through.
   To illustrate the winners and losers, consider the case of
three-term Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La. The chairman of the
Senate Energy Committee received $47,625 in outside fees in 1987 and
kept $34,940, near the maximum he could retain under Senate rules.
   Johnston would receive a $45,500 raise, but after taking into
account the loss of his outside fees, he would be ahead by only
$10,560.
   On the other hand, two-term Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who takes
no outside fees, would be $45,500 richer before taxes if he accepted
the raise. However, Levin said he would not accept the salary hike.
   Senators are permitted to keep outside fees totaling up to 40
percent of salary, a current cap of $35,800. Any amount over that
figure goes to charity.
   House rules are different, allowing members to keep 30 percent of
salary, or $26,850.
   The outside fees normally come from special interest groups
seeking influence in Congress.
   Levin said acceptance of honoraria leaves ``a terrible appearance
that somehow or other we're for sale. It's long overdue that we say
no to special interest groups putting dollars in our pockets.''
   As for the pay bonanza he would receive, Levin said it isn't
justified.
   ``There's just no way to justify this pay hike at this time,'' he
said. ``We have a huge deficit. The Congress will be asking the
American people for some shared sacrifice. You can't lead in that
kind of an issue by taking a pay increase yourself.''
   An official of the self-styled citizen's lobby, Common Cause,
said the important issue is eliminating outside fees, not the size
of the raise.
   Ann McBride, Common Cause senior vice president, said, ``The
issue is, we've got to get rid of this corrupt system. Special
interest money should not be financing our public officials. We need
to pay our public officials at an appropriate level.''

<HEAD>Small Harvest a Disappointment as Leadership Approaches Plenum</HEAD>

   A dip in the Soviet grain harvest is a
disappointment for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as he prepares for
agricultural reforms, and may affect food supplies and buying
strategies, Western analysts said Tuesday.
   ``This really is a disappointment. Just for credibility's sake
they have to improve grain production. It's not happening,'' said
one Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Soviet officials on Monday announced that the 1988 grain harvest
was 195 million tons, less than the 210 million tons in each of the
previous two years.
   Gorbachev is trying to reform Soviet farm policy by encouraging
workers on the collective and state farms that were formed forcibly
in the 1930s to work in smaller groups. He wants to give them
long-term leases that will allow them to consider themselves masters
of the state-owned land and offer the opportunity to earn more money
for harder work.
   A meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee is scheduled for March to consider reform in the farm
sector, which is characterized by indifference, low productivity,
and large losses in transportation, storage and processing. The
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported last week that three out of
four potatoes harvested in the Soviet Union go to waste.
   A smaller grain harvest also will require the Soviets to divert
more of their hard currency earnings to buying food rather than new
foreign technology to modernize industry.
   The harvests of 210 million tons of grain in each of the last two
years were short of the targets of about 230 million tons, which
Western experts considered unrealistic, but better than the average
annual harvest of about 180 million tons in the first half of the
decade.
   Even with a harvest the size of those in 1986 and 1987, the
Soviet Union had to import millions of tons of grain to provide
bread and pasta products for its population and feed for its cattle.
   The official press warned consumers last fall that the harvest
would be lower this year, blaming drought that afflicted many of the
grain-growing regions in 1988. The Western analyst, however, said
the cold and rainy 1987 growing season had been even worse for grain.
   Experts said the shortfall would not affect the amount of bread
in Soviet shops, which is one of the few items that is always
plentiful. But it could affect meat and dairy products.
   A second expert said an increase had been noticed in the amount
of veal offered for sale at farmers' markets, indicating more calves
were being slaughtered, and that Soviet statistics indicated a
slight drop in milk production.
   The experts agreed the appearance of more veal is a likely result
of a shortage of cattle feed, but differed on whether it was grain
or other feed elements such as sileage and hay that were in short
supply.
   In any case, they said the dry 1988 weather was likely to
increase the protein quality of the grain harvested, making it
better for bread products. That would send the Soviets into the
world market for more feed-quality grain.
   In a meeting at the party's Central Committee late last week in
preparation for the March plenary session, Gorbachev told farm
officials that bureaucrats and neighbors alike treat farmers who are
trying to take advantage of his reforms like ``Rockefellers,'' and
that laws were being written to protect them.
   ``Many people, especially the lazy, don't like the fact that
leasing is destroying the ethics and habits of the years of
stagnation, when you could get a good salary no matter how you
worked,'' Gorbachev said.

   James A. Baker III, President-elect Bush's
choice to be secretary of state, promised on Tuesday to investigate
a senator's contention that Soviet chemical weapons have been
stockpiled by Cuban troops in Angola.
   Baker, answering questions at his Senate confirmation hearing,
responded to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who expressed concern about
the just-signed agreement mediated by the United States for the
pullout of Cuban troops from Angola.
   Helms said he was worried that the agreement would abandon Jonas
Savimbi, leader of the U.S.-backed Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA), to the mercies of the Cubans and Marxist allies
in the Angolan government.
   The senator said he had sent staff members to Angola to discuss
the pullout agreement with Savimbi.
   ``I have some concern that he wasn't consulted. I don't
understand that kind of mediation _ negotiation,'' Helms said.
   Helms said his staff members found that in three battles last
year the Cubans used poison gas against UNITA, paralyzing 300
soldiers and killing 120.
   He said the staff members brought back reports that ``tons of
poison gas have arrived in Angola in Soviet transports within the
past few months and have been stored.''
   Baker said he had not known about such a development, adding,
``All I can promise you to do is to look into it immediately.''
   In response to a question, Baker said the United States had not
obtained any commitment that the Cubans would abstain from attacking
Savimbi's forces during their seven-month pullout.
   Baker reiterated the pledge made by Bush of continuing U.S.
support for Savimbi.

   Drug companies are making record investments in
research and development, but the Food and Drug Administration lacks
the resources to handle the wave of applications for new drug
approvals, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said Tuesday.
   The trade group said the pharmaceutical industry spent $6.5
billion on research and development in 1988, about 18 percent more
than the $5.5 billion industry spent in 1987.
   The industry also had record sales in 1988, the group said. A
survey of its more than 100 members showed they had sales of $46.2
billion last year, about 11 percent higher than in 1987.
   The increase in research and development spending reflects, at
least partly, higher costs due to inflation as well as the
industry's move into chronic diseases, such as cancer and AIDS,
research for which is more complicated and more expensive, said
Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the association.
   ``If research and development on chronic illnesses were easy, it
would have been done and solved some time ago,'' he said. ``We're
(now) taking on the diseases that haven't been cured or not
adequately treated.''
   The FDA last year approved 20 ``new molecular entities'' _ drugs
that are chemically different from anything previously approved.
Each was reviewed for an average 31 months by the agency before it
was approved and made available for physicians to prescribe to their
patients, the association said. That period is in addition to an
average four years spent developing each drug.
   FDA spokesman Bill Grigg noted that the 1988 average was down
from 32 months in 1987 and 34 months in 1986. The agency approved a
total of 792 drugs last year _ including new drugs, generic drugs
and drugs related to previously approved compounds. He also noted
that the agency has expedited procedures for drugs used to treat
cancer and AIDS.
   Mossinghoff said that with more money and staff and better
facilities, the FDA could cut the time needed to review new drug
applications to six months.
   The association supports FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young and his
efforts to streamline the approval process and make it more
efficient, Mossinghoff said.
   Young also has sounded an alarm over the agency's finances. He
said earlier this month that the FDA needs more resources to keep up
with the number of applications for new drug approvals, which he
said is doubling every year.
   President Reagan's proposed budget for fiscal 1990 would increase
funds for drug reviews by imposing a user fee on pharmaceutical
manufacturers in order to collect about $100 million next year.
   Mossinghoff called the fee ``a tax on innovation'' and urged
Congress to reject it.

   Country music singer Randy Travis was

ditch, police and his publicist said.
   Travis, 29, ended up in the ditch after he tried to avoid another
car in rural Cheatham County west of Nashville, publicist Evelyn

was shaken up, she said.
   They were en route from their farm to a high school to promote a
new booklet on teen-age problems.
   He is honorary chairman of the Youth Yellow Pages, a directory
featuring information and telephone numbers for teen-agers concerned
about AIDS, alcohol, drugs, peer pressure, pregnancy, sexual abuse,
venereal disease and violence.
   Shriver said Travis likely would continue with appearances
Wednesday on the NBC-TV show ``Late Night With David Letterman'' and
Thursday night at the nationally televised Presidential Inaugural
Gala on CBS.
   Travis is known for his hits ``Forever and Ever, Amen'' and his
current ``Deeper Than the Holler.''

   A third group claimed Tuesday it had
kidnapped former Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants, and one of
them demanded about $790,000 for his return, saying most of the
ransom must go to the poor.
   Police had no clues Tuesday about the conflicting claims from the
three groups in the Saturday abduction of the 69-year-old
conservative politician and businessman.
   A parliamentary commission on Tuesday was to have begun
investigating allegations that Vanden Boeynants accepted bribes when
he was a defense minister for seven years in the 1970s. The
proceedings were suspended because of his disappearance near his
home in a posh Brussels neighborhood.
   One of the groups, which called itself the Revolutionary
Socialist Brigade, said Vanden Boeynants, is ``a corrupt person ...
who has stolen large public funds for his own profit.'' The
previously unknown group said in a letter it would put him before a
``People's Tribunal.''
   Also on Tuesday, a man claiming to represent the left-wing
terrorist Fighting Communist Cells said in a taped telephone message
to a news agency that Vanden Boeynants would be killed in three days
if four of its militants were not released from prison.
   The third claim of responsibility was made to a radio station in
the Netherlands. The radio station said it received a call from a
person purporting to represent the notorious leftist French
terrorist group Direct Action.
   None of the groups offered proof they held Vanden Boeynants.
   Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet said investigators are sure of
only three things: Vanden Boeynants was the victim of a
well-prepared but violent kidnapping; he felt threatened before he
was abducted; and a ransom has been demanded.
   There actually were two claims from the group identifying itself
as the Revolutionary Socialist Brigade, one in telephone call and
the other in letters sent to two newspapers demanding the $790,000
ransom.
   The letters demanded that two-thirds of the money come from
Vanden Boeynants' political and business allies and be distributed
to the poor through five relief agencies.
   The remaining third of the ransom would fund the brigade's
program ``to motivate the people,'' the letters said.
   The phone call, also purportedly from the Revolutionary Socialist
Brigade, and related by deputy prosecutor Andre Vandoren, said:
``You will never see him again. We will return him in small pieces.''
   Wathelet said on national television that many unanswered
questions remain.
   ``Anything is still possible as regards the (identity of the)
kidnappers,'' he said.''
   Officials have expressed concern about the health of Vanden
Boeynants, who needs daily medication for a heart ailment.
   He was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and again from late
1978 until early 1979.
   In 1986, he received a three-year suspended sentence for tax
fraud as head of his meat packaging business. That conviction forced
him to drop a bid to become mayor of Brussels in October.

   Indian activist Eddie Hatcher failed to
appear for arraignment Tuesday on kidnapping charges stemming from
the takeover of a newspaper last February.
   Robeson County Superior Court Juge Anthony Brannon gave Hatcher
until Thursday to surrender, but Hatcher said he wouldn't come to
court.
   ``I am not going back to Robeson County,'' Hatcher said in a
telephone interview from the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho.
``I have appeared before a tribal judge here and they will have to
go through the tribal court now to get me back.''
   Brannon said Hatcher would forfeit the $25,000 bond posted by the
National Council of Churches if he failed to appear by Thursday.
   Hatcher is charged with 14 counts of second-degree kidnapping in
the 10-hour takeover of The Robesonian newspaper offices.
   He and another man, Timothy Jacobs, both Tuscarora Indians from
Pembroke, N.C., allegedly held up to 20 people hostage while Hatcher
demanded an investigation into alleged corruption and drug
trafficking in local government.
   The siege ended when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to establish a task
force to investigate the allegations. He did so, but later said the
panel found only ``rumors and gossip.''
   Hatcher and Jacobs were indicted by a Robeson County grand jury
in December. The state charges were filed after the two were
acquitted Oct. 14 on federal hostage-taking and firearms charges.
   Jacobs left Robeson County shortly after the indictments were
issued. He fled to the Onondaga Indian reservation in New York, but
was arrested off the reservation and is in an extradition battle.

   Someone is stealing the pricey pets of Long
Island.
   Ten snakes, two iguanas and a $1,400 cockatoo have been snatched
from two pet shops in Nassau County, police said Tuesday. It was not
known if the thefts were related.
   One man was arrested in the cockatoo caper, but the bird, the
lizards and the snakes, as well as at least one other robber, were
at large.
   On Monday, police said, Diane Rafferty was working at the shop
called Birds of a Higher Feather in Mineola when two men entered.
She told police one of the men engaged her in conversation while the
other apparently took a white Soffin cockatoo.
   She said she noticed the bird was missing after the men left.
   When police arrived, she told them that the man who talked to her
had asked the location of another pet store a mile away. Police went
there and arrested Rudolph Montoya, 19, who fit the description of
the man who spoke with Ms. Rafferty.
   Montoya was charged with grand larceny.
   In Farmingdale, the owner of Paul's Exotic Pet Store said he
found the snakes and iguanas missing when he opened the store
Monday. All were believed to be non-poisonous, said Officer Richard
Scabilia.
   The reptiles cost a total of about $1,500.

   Drugs seem to have replaced nuclear war as the
top concern of elementary school children.
   ``Please do something about the bad people who sell drugs to
little children. Put them in jail,'' pleaded a third-grader from
Rosedale, N.Y., in one of more than 60,000 letters written to
President-elect George Bush at the invitation of Scholastic News, a
classroom newsweekly read by 5 million students.
   Three-quarters of the letters written by the children in grades
three through six mentioned drugs as one of the country's biggest
problems, said Jeanne Krier, public relations director for
Scholastic News.
   Four years ago, the magazine's young readers advised President
Reagan that nuclear war was their top worry.
   ``Our young readers today are more concerned about drugs,
poverty, the homeless and pollution,'' said John Lent, Scholastic
News publisher.
   One fourth-grader from Harrisburg, Pa., wrote: ``I think the most
important issue in our country is drugs. It is killing people and
teen-agers and it is also interfering with our health. If you went
to the schools and educated the kids about drugs, it would help
solve all the problems.'
   Krier plans to send 25 letters to Bush along with a three-page
sampling of excerpts from others.
   A fifth-grader from McLean, Va., wrote: ``I think you should see
how much effect the war on drugs has on teen-agers. You should also
try to get the kids who stopped using drugs to encourage other
people to stop.''
   ``If anyone gets caught selling drugs, they should be put in
prison for five years _ child or adult,'' said a fifth-grader from
Pontiac, Ill.
   On poverty and the homeless, a fifth-grader from Atwater, Calif.,
wrote: ``There are a lot of people in this country without jobs and
people that sleep on park benches. America does not seem like a very
free country if we have people using garbage cans and boxes as a
home.''
   Other forums giving youngsters a chance to advise the
president-elect also showed social issues are primary concerns.
   Tips about caring for the homeless, helping Vietnam veterans and
feeding the world's starving people were in 900 letters sent to Bush
from elementary and middle school pupils in Columbus, Ohio.
   Products of the Election Day 1988 ``Tips for the President''
essay contest were presented to U.S. Rep. John Kasich for delivery
to the White House.
   Hattie White, 13, an eighth-grader at Hilltonia Alternative
Middle School, said she was glad the whales off of the Alaska coast
were freed, but, ``How many people will freeze to death without
shelter? Will you work as hard for the people as you did for the
whales?''
   Some kindergarten students in Chicago had more immediate concerns.
   ``If bad kids beat up good kids, the president should take them
to their moms,'' said Sarah.
   Perhaps the most enigmatic advice to Bush came from a boy named
Matt, who said: ``Be a woman, put sharks in cages and kill all bees
in the world.''

   Charlitta Payton's roots are in the Catholic
Church, and she is not going to let the Archdiocese of Detroit close
the inner-city church she attended as a girl without a fight.
   She is returning to Our Lady of the Rosary Church, for herself
and for future generations of black Catholics endangered by an
archdiocesan plan to close as many as 55 city churches.
   ``When they become adults, all of their hope has been killed
through things like this,'' said Payton, who had attended another
neighborhood church that is not scheduled for closing. ``That is why
I was concerned about coming back to my roots.''
   Our Lady of the Rosary is on a critical list of 25 parishes whose
viability is under question; it has a year to meet criteria set by
the archdiocese or it will meet the same fate as 30 churches already
ordered closed by June.
   At least 12 of the 30 have filed appeals with Cardinal Edmund
Szoka; nine have decided to accept the ruling and others were
undecided, the Detroit Archdiocese said. The churches have until
Friday to appeal to the archdiocese.
   Szoka defends the closings as necessary to maintain 82 viable
churches and to help end a ``plantation mentality,'' which he
defined as white parish leaders running churches attended largely by
blacks.
   But for many black Catholics, who represent 4 percent of the 1.5
million Catholics in the archdiocese, the church closing plan has
showed them their place in the predominantly white church.
   ``Now that it has come down to economic strain ... with not a lot
of employment money coming in, we are the last to be thought of,''
Payton said Monday.
   Black Lay Catholics with a Vision, a group formed to fight the
closings, said the diocese has angered blacks struggling to maintain
the church in a city where 60 percent of the population is black.
   ``This is a time when they should be trying to build more
churches, not close any down,'' said Marian Gabriel, co-chairwoman
of the group. ``We are very angered by what supposedly has done us a
favor.''
   At St. Philip Neri Church, Doris Ann Whigham worries about what
will happen to the poor when her parish and the soup kitchen it
operates closes in June.
   ``A lot of people don't believe in God. What is going to happen
to them?'' she asked.
   ``They can't ... feel the love and warmth we give them'' at the
church in affluent Grosse Point Park that St. Philip Neri is
supposed to merge with.
   But a black auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese supports Szoka.
   ``Nobody is taking their lives away from them,'' said Bishop
Moses B. Anderson. ``Our religion is a religion of hope. Those who
purvey it as something else are being unfaithful.''
   ``We have seen things, terrible things, we've seen profound
changes,'' he said. ``And we can look at change in a positive way.
The black community has that faith. And I think that's a gift.''
   The church in Detroit is not alone.
   Msgr. John Tracy Ellis, a historian at the Catholic University of
America in Washington said he thinks other cities that have seen
large white Catholic populations leave for the suburbs will have
similar problems.
   ``You could say the church has no control over it,'' Ellis said.
   The Archdiocese of New York tried to deal with too few Catholics
for too many parishes two decades ago when it established the
Inter-parish City Finance Corp., spokesman Joseph Zwilling said.
   The corporation lets wealthier churches help older, poorer
churches financially. However, Ellis said Cardinal John O'Connor
recently warned that several urban churches were suffering
financially.
   In Chicago, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin issued a set of guidelines
in 1987 to assist parishes in conducting a self-evaluation, said the
Rev. George Sarauskas, director of the office for research and
planning for the archdiocese.
   Sarauskas said last year three black parishes, working together,
consolidated, and he said 10 other mostly black parishes are
undergoing a planning process that likely will result in some
closings and consolidations.
   But some black Catholics in Detroit reject the official
explanantions.
   ``How can you say you are going to better something and then take
away the facility, the churches and the priests?'' Gabriel asked.
   And when the church pulls out, Payton wonders, what will be left
behind.
   ``You can very well accept other organizations and businesses
pulling away if even the church is leaving.''

   The Supreme Court was urged Tuesday to give
states sweeping power to control child pornography by upholding a
ban on nude depictions of children, even by a parent.
   ``It's clear that posing a child in a state of nudity can and
does do harm,'' said Attorney General James Shannon of
Massachusetts. ``The child will experience shame, a fear of
blackmail.''
   Shannon appealed to the justices to reverse a Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court ruling that threw out a state
anti-pornography law on grounds it could make it a crime for parents
to photograph their naked toddlers on the beach.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, picking up on that theme, asked
Shannon what is wrong with taking a picture of a naked infant on a
bear rug _ a pose familiar to millions.
   ``Those pictures are lawful,'' Shannon replied. He said no
prosecutor in Massachusetts ever envisioned invoking the invalidated
law to prevent that sort of activity.
   Some justices suggested they could dispose of the case without
issuing a broad ruling, dealing with the constitutionality of the
law, because Massachusetts has replaced the statute with a narrower
law.
   The former law, enacted in 1982, made it a crime to encourage or
permit a child under 18 ``to pose or be exhibited in a state of
nudity'' for purposes of a photograph, picture or other ``visual
reproduction,'' even for private, non-commercial use.
   The Massachusetts Legislature has since revised the law to make
such activity illegal only if done with ``lascivious intent.''
   Shannon said the new law might not be strong enough to protect
children from sexual abuse. ``I can think of no obligation of the
state that is more important,'' he said.
   He also said that while many states have laws against child
pornography, he believed only Kansas and Ohio had passed statutes as
tough as the one struck down in Massachusetts.
   The Massachusetts court ruling overturned the conviction of
Douglas Oakes, 40, of Holden for taking photographs in 1984 of his
14-year-old stepdaughter while she posed topless, clad only in a red
scarf and bikini underwear on a bar in their home.
   Prosecutors said the girl later threw the photos in the woods and
Oakes made her retrieve them. Oakes was arrested after the girl's
mother went to police with the photos.
   He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was paroled after two
years.
   The Massachusetts high court, by a 4-3 vote, said the law was too
broad in restraining freedom of expression because it could make it
a crime for a parent to take a snapshot of a ``naked one-year-old
running on a beach or romping in a wading pool.''
   Richard J. Vita, Oakes' lawyer, said Tuesday the state has not
offered ``proof of serious harm to minors'' from posing in the nude.
   He said that the photographs at issue in the case are not
pornographic and that the state was trying to outlaw ``an area of
expression that is much a part of our culture.''
   Some justices said the state does not have to prove harm to
minors to outlaw such depictions.
   Justice Antonin Scalia questioned whether freedom of expression
was at stake at all when a state makes it a crime to photograph
someone in the nude.
   ``I don't think you're talking about the First Amendment'' even
when one says parents should be free to photograph their naked
infants on a bear rug, Scalia said. ``That's a question of whether
the state can intrude on the parent-child relationship.''
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Oakes, 87-1651.

   Czechoslovak police drove crowds from
Prague's main square with water cannons for a third day Tuesday,
although no protest was being held, and 14 activists may be
prosecuted, dissidents and witnesses said.
   Fourteen dissidents were detained Monday, including playwright
Vaclav Havel, whose works are banned.
   They had tried to lay flowers in Wenceslas Square to honor Jan
Palach, a 20-year-old student who burned himself alive 20 years ago
to protest the Soviet-led invasion that ended the liberal ``Prague
Spring'' in August 1968.
   A prosecutor told relatives Dana Nemcova, spokeswoman for the
human rights group Charter 77, and Sasha Vondra, a Charter 77
spokesman, would stay in custody for an unspecified period, a
dissident source said by telephone phone from Prague.
   Ms. Nemcova's son, David, who was married Saturday, also was
among the 14 arrested Monday along with Jana Sternova, a former
Charter 77 spokeswoman who met with President Reagan last year in
Washington.
   Emigre sources said privately that David Nemcova's wife Michaela
and Vondra's wife Martina were told their relatives would be charged
under Article 156, Section A, of the criminal code, on obstructing
the duty of a public official. The maximum jail sentence on
conviction is six months.
   Whether charges would be pressed against any or all of the 14 was
not clear, the informants said.
   Witnesses said police had at least four water cannons Tuesday and
sprayed people in the square indiscriminately.
   About two dozen vans of police rushed into the square in what
appeared to be a preventive measure, since no demonstration was
being conducted. Except for several hundred young people, most of
those in the square appeared to be people passing through on normal
daily business, the witnesses said.
   The witnesses, speaking by telephone from Prague, said people ran
from the square to keep from being drenched and it was quiet after
about two hours, with police patrolling constantly.
   CTK, the official Czechoslovak news agency, said 91 people were
detained Sunday at a rally of at least 5,000 people in Palach's
honor.
   An emigre source said 89 were released later Sunday, but a
dissident source in Prague quoted one of those freed as saying the
number detained appeared to be much higher than reported by the
agency.
   No official comment was available on the numbers of people
arrested or released. The home telephone of government spokesman
Miroslav Pavel was not answered Tuesday.
   An Associated Press reporter saw police beat several people at
the Sunday rally. At least one man was so badly hurt that other
demonstrators called for an ambulance.
   Several ambulances were seen rushing through the streets of
Prague on Sunday.
   Palach Press, an emigre publishing house in London, said a
59-year-old suffered a skull fracture.
   Jan Kavan of Palach Press said it was not clear from his source
whether the injury occurred Sunday or Monday, or whether the man was
a demonstrator or bystander.
   Also among the 14 is Jana Sternova, a former Charter 77
spokeswoman who met with President Reagan last year in Washington.
   After police cleared Wenceslas Square on Monday with tear gas and
water cannon, CTK carried a dispatch referring to ``groups of
anti-state elements, organized under the pretext of an anniversary
of Jan Palach's suicide,'' who had ``attempted to continue Sunday's
provocation.''
   ``The provocateurs disrupted public order with their aggressive
behavior even despite repeated appeals to disperse,'' the agency
said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union announced agreements on
Tuesday with two U.S. companies _ Marriott Corp. and Huntsman
Chemical Corp. _ to provide and package meals for passengers of the
Soviet airline Aeroflot.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin held a joint news conference with
the heads of the two companies, J. W. Marriott Jr. of Washington,
D.C., and Jon Huntsman of Salt Lake City, to give details of the
joint ventures set up without public announcement in Moscow last
month.
   Marriott said his company would spend $5 million on the venture
which would include modernizing a three-story flight kitchen
operation at Moscow's Sheremetjevo Airport.
   He said he expects to use traditional Soviet food but will also
introduce more European and American cuisine on Soviet flights. He
said it was the first time the Soviets have arranged with a Western
company for contracted food services in the Soviet Union.
   Aeroflot already has contracts with Marriott to provide meals on
its airplanes at several airports outside the Soviet Union.
   Vladimar A. Nacharov, Aeroflot director general, said Soviet
officials hope the new businesses will ``operate both efficiently
and profitably.'' He said the Soviets made the deal with Marriott
because it was the only company with the capacity to serve the
world's largest airline, which has flights to 3,600 Soviet and 100
foreign airports and more than 180 million passengers a year.
   Asked if the Soviet airline was currently serving meals on its
flights, Nacharov said, ``Sometimes.''
   Huntsman said the venture would mark the return of his company to
food packaging after it sold off a company that designed McDonald's
hamburger containers.
   His company, in a separate joint agreement, is to make plastic
food services products for Aeroflot, with a manufacturing and
packaging operation at the Moscow airport.
   Marriott Corp., which says it provides over 150 million meals a
year to 150 airlines, said its Moscow operation will be one of its
biggest.
   The joint Soviet-Marriott company is called Aeromar, Ltd., and is
51 percent owned by Aeroflot and 49 percent by Marriott.
   The operations are expected to begin this summer.
   Both Marriott and Huntsman said they were looking into other
business ventures in the Soviet Union. Marriott said a team from his
company would evaluate the feasibility of a Moscow hotel. Huntsman
said his company was evaluating a major petrochemical project in
western Siberia.
   Huntsman, interviewed after the news conference, said ``some
eyebrows might be raised'' in Utah over the fact that it took the
Soviet Union to bring ``two Mormon boys'' together in business.
Though he and Marriott, who also has family roots in Utah, are
longtime friends, they have not taken part in such a business deal
before.

<HEAD>Report Finds Consensus on Need for START Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is general agreement in Congress and
among foreign policy experts that the Bush administration should
complete a U.S.-Soviet treaty on strategic arms, negotiate
reductions in conventional arms in Europe and eliminate chemical
weapons, says a report released Tuesday.
   The report by the Annapolis Group, a bipartisan think tank of
politicians and policy experts, said the incoming administration's
top foreign policy priority should be the START treaty for reducing
strategic arms.
   The group also found overall support for retaining senior arms
control negotiators Paul Nitze and Max Kampelman, negotiating
reductions in conventional arms in Europe and elimination of
chemical weapons, and continuing Star Wars research at about current
funding levels.
   More than 125 members of Congress, current and former
administration officials and foreign policy experts were interviewed
for the project, and the group said the report represented a
consensus of views.
   During a six-month period, the group questioned among others,
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee; Secretary of the Navy Will Ball, Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan.; and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's nominee for national
security adviser.
   The report said Bush will likely want to avoid ``conveying any
sense of haste or urgency about completion of the START
negotiation.''
   ``A sense of haste would be clearly counterproductive, not only
in terms of getting the best possible deal from the Soviet Union,
but in terms of securing Senate consent to ratification as well,''
it said.
   But the report stressed the importance of continuing START
negotiations and talks on conventional forces and chemical weapons,
noting that ``these efforts will advance your other interests in
modernizing our strategic forces and in developing a strategic
defense.''
   The START talks have been recessed since November. Bush said last
month it was unlikely his new administration would be ready with
proposals for the Feb. 15 date set by the Reagan administration for
continuation of the talks in Geneva.
   On conventional forces, the members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact
nations agreed this past week in Vienna to begin new talks starting
in March.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government is
mired in the biggest controversy of his six-year leadership over
allegations that West German companies helped Libya build a chemical
plant that can produce poison gas.
   Even members of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union say privately
he has bungled the issue and threatened the party's popularity by
dodging the question of whether he or his Cabinet members ignored
early reports of a German hand in the Libyan project.
   Kohl's chief aide is to appear before Parliament on Wednesday to
disclose new information about U.S. accusations that West German
firms took part in the Libyan project by selling materials in
violation of export controls.
   West Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party, demanding the
``whole truth'' be told, accused Kohl of inflicting lasting damage
to the nation's image and to relations with the United States. The
left-wing Greens Party called on the chancellor to resign.
   ``We're making complete fools of ourselves,'' commented a
government official from the Christian Democrats, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``The chancellor must extricate the
government from this controversy before the damage becomes
irreparable.''
   Kohl has been silent on the subject since Thursday, when he
acknowledged during a TV interview there were ``growing
indications'' of West German involvement in the Libyan affair.
   After several denials of government involvement, Kohl's
spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, refused to say Tuesday whether Bonn now
accepts U.S. claims that the plant near Tripoli is capable of
producing chemical weapons.
   ``We have no new information on this,'' Ost told reporters.
   But on Monday, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told
reporters the government now has ``concrete indications'' and
intelligence reports that make clear the plant in Rabta, southeast
of the Libyan capital, can produce chemical weapons.
   ``We must assume that the factory is a facility in which poison
gas can be produced,'' Stoltenberg said at a news conference.
   Finance Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz von den Driesch, sitting
three seats away from Ost at the conference, said Stoltenberg had
information from a trip to the United States last week that had not
been seen by officials in Bonn.
   Ost said the government's position would be explained on
Wednesday, when the chancellor's chief of staff, Wolfgang Schaeuble,
informs the Bundestag about what it knows of West German involvement.
   Opposition parties have and pressed the chancellor to clarify to
what degree West German firms have been involved, including one
company owned by the federal government.
   National newspapers have been critical of Kohl's handling of the
affair, describing the government as defensive in its stubborn
refrain that it has collected no evidence that would justify
criminal charges against any German companies.
   Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung commented Tuesday that Kohl had
lost political control of the affair by evading action and suggested
the government at least ask federal prosecutors to decide if charges
are in order.
   Social Democratic Party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel accused Kohl of
personal responsibility for a situation in which ``the German people
and the world public have long been decieved, that German-American
relations have been seriously hampered and that West Germany has
been exposed to worldwide suspicion of calling publicly for a ban on
chemical weapons while secretly fostering their production.''
   Petra Kelly, leader of the Greens party's parliamentary
delegation, demanded that Kohl resign over the government's
mishandling of the issue.
   Ost told reporters in early January that the government learned
of U.S. claims that West German firms helped build the Libyan plant
during Kohl's Nov. 15 visit to Washington.
   Eight days later, after West German media claimed intelligence
sources had informed the chancellor's office as long ago as 1986 of
apparent complicity, Ost corrected himself to say the first word
Kohl got of the affair came in mid-October.
   Stoltenberg said Monday that his office learned of ``vague''
indications in August, and Ost confirmed Tuesday that an
intelligence report had been made to the government on Aug. 2.
   What is seen by Americans as foot-dragging by Bonn poses a
potential threat to the strong position Kohl's party has in West
German politics.
   If West German firms are found to have broken the law Kohl's
government could appear to have tried to cover up for the companies,
or been slow to follow up on the American intelligence reports.

<HEAD>Peasants Risk Lives Racing Trucks of Grain Across Province Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of peasants are running truckloads of
grain across a provincial border in east China at breakneck speed in
the dead of night to get top prices, a state newspaper said Tuesday.
   The Peasants Daily said in a front-page story that grain-running
across Anhui provincial border into more prosperous neighboring
provinces is dangerous but profitable because of low prices inside
Anhui.
   Officials in the border region have tried to prevent the grain
outflow by setting up checkpoints to stop trucks. But the paper said
most trucks barrel past the checkpoints and elude pursuers in chases
that have resulted in at least one death.
   The paper criticized Anhui's low grain prices and its checkpoints
and warned such policies would only dampen peasants' enthusiasm for
planting grain at a time when grain harvests already are falling
behind population growth.
   In one accident along what it called the ``blood-stained grain
road,'' a 19-year-old youth driving a grain-laden truck lost control
and crashed as he tried to speed past one checkpoint. He was killed.
   A few days earlier, a checkpoint official who chased a speeding
truck leaped onto its running board and punched his fist through the
window to force the driver to stop. The driver did not stop, but the
official suffered cuts and had to undergo surgery, the paper said.
   ``The grain truckers who make these death-defying dashes are
lured by the high prices'' outside Anhui, it wrote. ``After a
three-mile dash, they can earn more than $270 for their load, but if
they are stopped at the checkpoint they are fined $810. Who wouldn't
risk his life?''
   Peasants must sell a fixed portion of their harvests directly to
the state but supppsedly are allowed to sell the rest on the open
market in any province.
   Officials in Anhui, however, feared all the grain would flow to
neighboring Jiangsu, Fujian and Guangdong, where higher prices are
offered. The going price in Jiangsu after the autumn harvest was 12
cents a pound of unhusked rice, compared with 9.6 cents a pound in
Anhui border area.
   The relatively wealthy provinces of Fujian and Guangdong to the
southeast offer even more, the paper said. Both provinces have
prosperous industrial and export sectors and generally attract much
of the region's grain because of the high prices they can offer.
   Unhappy with Anhui's low prices, many peasants have withheld from
sale an estimated 300,000 tons of grain. The paper noted this means
they will have less ready cash for investing in next year's crop.
   It did not comment on the impact on grain supplies, which are
short in many parts of the country because of a poor harvest.
   China harvested less than 393 million tons of rice, wheat and
other grains in 1988, down from nearly 403 million tons in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Latin aliens in an out-of-control influx, streaming
into makeshift quarters. The smoke of civil rage curling out of a
predominantly black neighborhood. Miami's twin crises.
   While the dozens of Nicaraguan refugees arriving daily and racial
disturbances in the city's Overtown area had the Super Bowl host
city's promoters fretting about Miami's image, community leaders
were more concerned with the threat of ethnic divisions.
   For some leaders, particularly those in the black community,
there were disturbing similarities to 1980, when the Mariel Boatlift
overwhelmed Miami with 100,000 Cuban refugees and racial tensions
twice flared into violence in black neighborhoods.
   Tensions were simmering among some blacks over perceived unjust
treatment from police and feelings of frustration over perceived
uneven treatment given the Nicaraguans, community leaders said.
   The hoopla over Super Bowl, with the city showing off its new
skyline, new bayside attractions and improved image may have added
to disaffection, and the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by
police Monday evening provided the spark, they said.
   ``There have been a lot of other tensions the last few weeks.
They just needed a catalyst,'' said state Rep. James Burke. ``These
people involved could care less about the Super Bowl being here.
It's not going to help their lives.''
   ``It's really close to what happened before in 1980,'' said Garth
Reeves, long-time publisher of the black-oriented newspaper The
Miami Times.
   His newspaper in recent weeks reported complaints that police
were being particularly violent with blacks, while resentment was
rising over the influx of Nicaraguans, coming here by bus at 200 a
day.
   ``This incident is unfortunate,'' Reeves said of the shooting,
adding: ``There's reaction from the influx of Nicaraguan refugees,
these people coming in and getting jobs that a lot of young blacks
claim are not open to them.''
   In late April 1980, Cuban President Fidel Castro opened the Port
of Mariel to boats from Florida, and some 125,000 Cubans arrived in
less than five months. Placed initially in tent cities, most settled
in the Miami area. On May 18 that year, the acquittal of Metro-Dade
police officers charged with beating a black motorcyclist to death
sparked three days of riots that claimed 18 lives and hundreds of
millions of dollars in damage.
   Less than two months later, more racial disturbances flared for
three days after an incident between police and blacks.
   Three more days of violent disturbances erupted in December 1982
after police fatally shot a black youth, and street violence flared
again when the Cuban-born officer was acquitted of manslaughter in
that case. More than 200 arrests were made.
   As in 1980, when some blacks felt the Miami community, whose
largest ethnic group now is the Cubans with one-third of Dade
County's population, was making a special effort to welcome the
Mariel refugees, some blacks are now resenting what they see as
open-arms treatment for Nicaraguans refugees being housed at the
Miami baseball stadium and other community shelters.
   ``The African-Americans have felt cheated,'' said Johnnie
McMillian, president of the Miami branch of the National Association
for Advancement of Colored People. ``We felt we were losing our
place in the city.''
   Gerard Jean-Juste, a fiery leader in the Haitian community that
numbers some 100,000 in South Florida _ about the same as the
Nicaraguan exile community _ said the Nicaraguan influx underlines
what he calls racist U.S. treatment of Haitians. Since 1981, Coast
Guard patrols have intercepted Haitians immigration authorities say
are coming here for economic, not political, reasons.
   ``They interdict the Haitians at sea ... and they meanwhile offer
the red-carpet treatment to Nicaraguans,'' Jean-Juste said.
   Xavier Suarez, Miami's Cuban-born mayor, expressed disappointment
over the violence, while saying its Super Bowl week timing wasn't
his biggest worry now.
   ``Obviously, any incident of this sort affects Miami's image,''
Suarez said. ``The timing is always bad.''
   The second-term mayor said he had been trying to ease Overtown's
problems.
   ``That's also the area in which the city has been making its
greatest effort with the largest urban renewal project, affordable
housing, possibly in the entire nation,'' Suarez said.
   Others say the city could do more.
   Burke, who was on a 1980 commission that studied the riot
aftermath, noted that county voters last year rejected a proposal
for a juvenile welfare board aimed at helping black youths stay in
school or get jobs.
   ``The young black males are the ones you see involved in this.
Those are the people you would have reached,'' Burke said. ``The
answers are there. Unfortunately, 1980 has been too far away for
some people to care about anymore.''

<HEAD>Department Will Reserve Summer Jobs for Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that
for the first time it will reserve some of its summer jobs for
students from 17 historically black universities.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said 563 of the 1989 summer jobs
will be held aside as part of the department's effort ``to increase
the number of minorty students in agriculture, forestry and home
economics'' and to seek careers in those fields.
   Last year 17,753 students nationwide worked during the summer
months for various USDA agencies, and officials said they expect
about that many this year. The 563 jobs reserved for the black
schools would represent about 3 percent of the total.
   ``Agriculture is more than crop and livestock production,'' Myers
said. ``Animal and plant sciences, economics, forestry, marketing
and computer technology are just some of the varied career fields in
agriculture today.''
   Myers said the jobs will be with 19 USDA agencies and will be
located nationwide. He said interested students at 17 institutions
should contact unversity placement offices before March 1.
   The universities, collectively known as 1890 institutions because
of land-grant legislation that year, are being targeted in other
ways by USDA, Myers said.
   On Dec. 29, the department announced it was establishing offices
at each of the 17 schools to help encourage more minorities in
agriculture. Also, on Jan. 9, the Reagan administration proposed a
USDA budget for next year that included $80.2 million for new and
expanded programs to increase the teaching, recruitment and research
capabilities at the 1890 schools, a 20 percent increase from the
current level.
   The 17 schools are:
   Alabama A&amp;M, Huntsville.
   Alcorn State University, Lorman, Miss.
   University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff.
   Delaware State College, Dover.
   Florida A&amp;M University, Tallahassee.
   Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley, Ga.
   Kentucky State University, Frankfort.
   Langston University, Langston, Okla.
   Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Mo.
   Unversity of Maryland-Eastern Shore, Princess Anne.
   North Carolina A&amp;T State University, Greensboro.
   Prairie View A&amp;M University, Prairie View, Texas.
   South Carolina State College, Orangeburg.
   Southern University, Baton Rouge, La.

<HEAD>Actor Trey Wilson Dies At Age 40</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trey Wilson, a character actor who appeared on
stage and screen in recent hits from ``Raising Arizona'' to ``Bull
Durham,'' has died of a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 40.
   Wilson, a native of Houston and graduate of the University of
Houston, died Monday at New York Hospital.
   Donna Massetti, spokeswoman for his manager, said Wilson was at
home in New York on Sunday when he complained of a headache, and
then lost consciousness.
   He was about to depart for New Orleans to play a role that was
written especially for him in ``Miller's Crossing,'' a new film by
Joel and Ethan Coen, the brothers responsible for ``Raising
Arizona.''
   In that film, Wilson played Nathan Arizona, the father of
quintuplets, one of whom is stolen by a childless couple. Wilson
also played the manager in ``Bull Durham''; an FBI boss in ``Married
to the Mob'; a wealthy Texan in ``Twins.''
   He also appeared in ``A Soldier's Story,'' ``F-X'' and ``The
House on Carroll Street.''
   Two other films _ ``Welcome Home'' and ``Miss Firecracker'' _
have not yet been released, along with the just-completed ``Great
Balls of Fire,'' the Jerry Lee Lewis story in which Wilson plays Sam
Phillips, owner of Sun Records.
   He also appeared on stage in ``The Front Page'' at Lincoln
Center, ``Custom of the Country'' at the Second Stage and ``The
Debutante Ball'' at Manhattan Theater Club.
   His Broadway credits include ``Peter Pan,'' ``Tintypes,'' ``The
First'' and ``Foxfire.''
   He is survived by his wife, Judy Blye; a stepson, Eric Meadows of
New York; his mother, Mitzie Norman; and his stepfather, W.F.
Norman, both of Houston.
   Burial was scheduled for Saturday in Houston. A memorial service
would be held later in New York, Ms. Massetti said.

<HEAD>Cave Paintings Stolen From Famous Buddhist Shrine</HEAD>

   Thieves cut a 700-year-old fresco from the wall of
one of northwestern China's famous Dunhuang caves, one-time Buddhist
shrines filled with magnificent paintings and statues, the People's
Daily reported Tuesday.
   The theft, from a cave that was not open to the public, was
discovered Friday, the paper said. The thieves cut the
10-square-foot fresco into five pieces for easy removal, but one
piece broke, the report said.
   The report did not describe the painting or comment on how the
thieves got into the cave. It said a fresco also was stolen from
Dunhuang in 1986 and the thieves have not been found.
   In the fourth century, monks who first introduced Buddhism to
China from India opened cave temples in Dunhuang, along ancient
trading routes in what is now Gansu province. Over the next few
centuries, hundreds of caves were dug out of the arid hillsides of
Dunhuang and their walls covered with religious murals.
   When the trade routes fell into disuse, the caves were abandoned
and forgotten. They were rediscovered in about 1900 and found to
contain thousands of priceless manuscripts and terra cotta statues.
   Only a few dozen of the caves are open to the public now as a
tourist attraction.
   Millions of dollars' worth of ancient artifacts are smuggled out
of China each year, officials estimate, most through Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
criticized four East European nations Tuesday about human rights and
said ``dark areas remain'' in the Soviet Union, but an aide reported
Kremlin assurances of improvement.
   A senior State Department official said a ranking member of the
Soviet delegation to the 35-nation Helsinki review conference told
him during Shultz's last mission abroad ``the whole process will
move ahead'' during the Bush administration.
   According to the official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
the Soviet delegate said the cases of 20 more Jews who want to
emigrate have been resolved and relatives of citizens who apply for
exit visas no longer will be urged to object.
   Family objections have been used by Soviet authorities to reject
applications.
   ``I really believe them,'' the U.S. official said. ``All these
things are being volunteered.''
   Shultz praised the Soviets and two East European allies, Poland
and Hungary, for taking steps to implement the 1975 Helsinki
agreements on European security and cooperation.
   He called Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``strong and
creative,'' and credited him with improving human rights.
   Signed by the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada and all
European nations except Albania, the Helsinki agreemenrference
late last year.
   At a news conference, he called for the destruction of the Berlin
Wall, built in 1961 to keep East Germans from fleeing to the West.
   ``There has been tremendous progress but the Berlin Wall remains,
as a symbol of the division of Europe, an inhumane structure and
something that functionally separates people,'' he said. ``So, in
the end that sort of thing has to come down.''
   Shultz criticized Romania for reserving the right to select which
provisions of Sunday's declaration it would observe, although he had
not done so in his address.
   Romania told delegates Sunday, before adoption of the final
document, that it would not honor provisions on greater religious
freedom and emigration.
   One provision of the document is a mandate for new negotiations,
scheduled to begin March 9, on reducing conventional military forces
in Europe.
   ``I have some genuine optimism about the prospects,'' Shultz said.
   His last trip as secretary of state was one of the shortest. He
was in Vienna for 32 hours, then flew home to prepare to relinquish
his office Friday.

<HEAD>Law To Be Revised To Ensure Security Agency's Political Neutrality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A revised law will prevent the main
government intelligence agency from engaging in political activity,
the agency's chief said Tuesday.
   Park Seh-jik, director of the Agency for National Security, told
a National Assembly subcommittee the government would add a clause
to the law governing the agency that would ban political activity.
But he rejected an opposition demand that the agency's activity be
limited to gathering information on North Korea and other foreign
countries.
   ``In our reality, it is difficult to separate domestic
intelligence from that on North Korea,'' he said.
   The Agency for National Security, formerly the Korea Central
Intelligence Agency, has been a target of public criticism for its
active involvement in politics.
   Political neutrality for the agency was a campaign pledge of
President Roh Tae-woo in the December 1987 elections.

   Police chased a 16-year-old boy armed with a
pistol through the halls and across the roof of a high school
Tuesday after the boy fired two shots at school employees,
authorities said.
   ``There were no injuries and no shots were fired in the school,''
Officer John Bryson said.
   A security guard at Kennedy High School noticed the boy, armed
with a .38-caliber handgun, in the school at noon, school
spokeswoman Tina Parent said. The guard and Assistant Principal
Richard Jackson chased the boy from the school and into Bayou St.
John across the street, she said.
   When cornered in the bayou, Parent said the boy drew a gun and
fired at Jackson and the security guard.
   Police joined school security in chasing the teen-ager, who ran
back into school and through the halls with the gun, Bryson said.
   At one point, Bryson said, the boy pointed the weapon at a police
sergeant who also had his weapon drawn. ``The sergeant ordered him
to drop it, but he ran away instead,'' Bryson said.
   The boy climbed through a vent and onto the top of the
three-story building, running back and forth across the roof before
climbing down and being cornered outside the gymnasium, Bryson said.
   ``Police ordered him to drop the weapon that was pointed at
several officers. After about 10 seconds he did so,'' Bryson said.
   The boy, who was not identified by name, is a student at another
school, and police said they did not know why he was at Kennedy.
   The boy was booked on several counts including attempted murder,
Bryson said.
   Parent said students were kept in their rooms during the incident
and classes continued.

<TEXT>
   Police cordoned off a largely black neighborhood
today after a six-hour melee of shooting, burning and rock-throwing
that was touched off by the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist
by a white policeman.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez declared the situation in the Overtown
neighborhood under control this morning and called for an
investigation.
   ``There was a tranquility in Overtown this morning,'' Suarez said
at a news conference. ``The people know we are working toward
finding out the truth.''
   Suarez said he found nothing to substantiate claims by some
members of the black community that the unrest was caused by
resentment over the waves of Nicaraguan immigrants coming to Miami.
   He said he planned no curfew.
   ``We're looking to normalize everything and keep police presence
as unobtrusive as possible,'' he said.
   Police surrounded the neighborhood today and allowed only those
with legitimate business into the area, said a police spokesman,
Officer Angelo Bitsis. Schools in the neighborhood were closed.
   In the only incident of violence reported by police Tuesday
afternoon, a white man driving through the Overtown area reportedly
began shooting into a crowd of blacks, injuring one person before
driving away.
   The riot erupted on the night of the federal holiday for slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and as national attention
was focused on the city as the host of Sunday's Super Bowl. It also
rekindled memories of Miami riots in the early 1980s.
   ``It just exploded,'' said City Commissioner Rosario Kennedy as
she prepared to enter the 1{-square-mile area with a police escort.
``People have been celebrating Martin Luther King's birthday all
day. Maybe they were drunk. We just don't know.''
   The riot began about 8 p.m., about two hours after the death of
motorcyclist Clement Lloyd. Lloyd, 21, was shot in the head as he
was being chased for an alleged traffic violation, said Sgt. Michael
Mazur, another police spokesman.
   Police Sgt. David Rivero said the department was investigating
unsubstantiated reports that the men may have been involved in a
robbery.
   At least two officers were pursuing the motorcyclist for alleged
erratic driving when they passed a third officer, William Lozano,
who was stopped by the side of the road in an unrelated incident,
police said.
   Lozano, who is white, shot Lloyd as the motorcycle came toward
him, said Assistant Police Chief Don March.
   The motorcycle crashed into a moving car, seriously injuring
Lloyd's 24-year-old brother, who was a passenger. The brother, whose
name was not immediately released, was in critical condition today,
according to Jackson Memorial Hospital officials.
   Police said Lozano was temporarily taken off duty.
   The Dade County Medical Examiner's office issued a statement
today confirming that Lloyd was killed by the gunshot, not by the
crash.
   Within minutes of the shooting, at least 100 blacks began
throwing rocks and bottles at police, who called for reinforcements.
About 125 officers cordoned off the area, authorities said.
   Four people, including one police officer, were treated for cuts
and minor injuries, said Jackson Hospital spokesman Tony Fallon.
   At one point, the Miami Herald reported, Suarez approached the
crowd in an effort at concilation but was driven back by rocks and
bottles.
   An auto parts store was burned to the ground after firefighters
were shot at and had to leave the area, Mazur said.
   During the height of the violence, tear gas was used to disperse
some crowds, who attacked and burned several clearly marked news
media cars.
   WCIX-TV reporter Lourdes Ruiz-Toledo said she feared for her life.
   ``All of a sudden they threw a big huge rock right on the side of
the driver. I blocked it with my elbow. They were yelling `Get that
white woman out of the car!''' the 27-year-old reporter said.
   Miss Ruiz-Toledo, who had stayed in her car while two colleagues
got out, said she drove a block and was rescued by an officer who
led her from the car behind a plastic riot shield. The car was later
burned.
   A woman driving home from work said her windshield was shattered
by a 5-pound concrete block.
   ``I had no idea it was going on,'' said Kay Worthington of Miami
Beach. ``There were about 20 kids all throwing things. I didn't see
any cops around there.''
   Some blacks say they have been frustrated since Miami officials
began providing free shelter for about 250 Nicaraguans seeking
political asylum.
   ``They feel that other folks are being recognized and getting a
piece of the pie but things are different for them. They feel they
don't have nothing and what do they have to lose?'' said Preston
Marshall, who had organized a parade in King's honor that drew an
estimated 100,000 people of all races in nearby Liberty City.
   ``Of all days, I didn't want this to happen,'' said Marshall, who
was among black community leaders called in by city officials to
help calm the crowd.
   No damage estimates were available. Some looting and gunfire
continued in Overtown early today.
   During three days of rioting in Overtown in 1982, arsonists
torched buildings and mobs broke into stores, causing millions of
dollars of damage. The riot was sparked by the fatal shooting of a
black man by a Cuban-born police officer.
   The officer was acquitted of manslaughter charges in March 1984,
sparking another disturbance that resulted in more than 200 arrests
and several injuries. A police internal affairs report in 1985
concluded that the officer was justified in using deadly force.
   In 1980, racial violence in Liberty City left 18 people dead, 400
injured and $100 million in damage. That rioting occurred after an
all-white jury acquitted several police officers of manslaughter in
the beating death of a black businessman.
   The scene of Monday's disturbance was about 15 miles from Joe
Robbie Stadium in north Dade County, the site of the Super Bowl. But
the Cincinnati Bengals are staying less than a mile away at the Omni
Hotel.
   The Miami Arena, where the Miami Heat of the National Basketball
Association has a game scheduled for tonight, is on the edge of
Overtown.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
530,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of 2 million
tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with the
United States, a pact now in its sixth year.
   Sims said the wheat is for shipment in January, February and
March. Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements,
the Soviets have 670,200 tons still available under the program.
   The Soviet Union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under
EEP arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. The
pact expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31,
1990.
   With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 1.3 million
tons of U.S. wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact.
   The EEP arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly
less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized,
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 530,000 tons of
wheat would be about 19.5 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than $4 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $78 million.
   Besides the wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the
Soviets have ordered 10.2 million tons of corn, 450,000 tons of
soybeans, and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of
grain sorghum. Only the wheat is subsizied.
   Sims said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of
$23.35 per ton, or about 64 cents per bushel. He said the bonuses on
the 530,000 tons of wheat will be paid to eight companies: Cargill
Inc., 80,000 tons; Continental Grain Co., 200,000; Garnac Grain Co.,
50,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 50,000; Tradigrain Inc., 50,000;
Mitsubishi International Corp., 25,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 25,000;
and Bunge Corp., 50,000.

   The prosecutor in the Heysel soccer
riots trial demanded Tuesday that two Belgian police officials be
convicted for failing to maintain security at the 1985 European
Champions' Cup match.
   Prosecutor Pierre Erauw was more lenient with two city officials
and two top European soccer officials who were sued by relatives of
the 39 people who died and hundreds who were injured in Europe's
worst soccer riot. They should not be punished, he said.
   On Wednesday Erauw is expected to call for severe sentences for
26 British suspects who face up to 10 years imprisonment on
involuntary manslaughter charges of instigating the riot before the
May 29, 1985, final between FC Liverpool and Juventus Turin.
   Twenty of the 26 Britons returned to Belgium this week for a
mandatory appearance during Erauw's final arguments. They probably
will be allowed to return home to await the end of the trial,
expected in March.
   On Monday, Erauw said Albert Roosens, secretary-general of the
Belgian soccer federation at the time of the tragedy, should be
blamed for poorly organizing the match.
   On Tuesday, he accused state police officials Johan Mahieu and
Michel Kensier of poorly organizing security at the match and not
taking sufficient action to halt the riot. He was particularly harsh
on Mahieu, who was responsible for security in the stands where the
riots occurred.
   ``Whatever, punish Kensier and Mahieu for what they did, or
rather for what they didn't do,'' Erauw told the court.
   But he did not call for punishment of Herve Brouhon, mayor of
Brussels city, which owns the stadium. Jacques Georges and Hans
Bangerter, chairman and secretary-general of the ruling body of
European soccer also were not accused.
   Just before the match at the Heysel Stadium, British fans charged
into an adjacent stand of Italian supporters, and 39 people were
trampled to death in the ensuing panic. Almost 500 were injured.
   Erauw is expected to end his final arguments Wednesday.
   The British suspects were extradited to Belgium after being
identified from video footage and photographs. The extradition was
exceptional and indicated Britain's resolve to stamp out soccer
hooliganism.

   Evangelist Jim Bakker pleaded innocent
Tuesday to federal charges that he diverted millions of dollars from
his PTL television audience for personal use.
   Bakker's lawyer, George T. Davis, asked U.S. Magistrate Paul
Taylor during the hearing for a gag order for all parties involved,
based largely on comments by the retired federal bankruptcy judge
who supervised the sale of PTL assets.
   Taylor said he would consider the request, instructing attorneys
from both sides to draft a consent order and present it to him by
Thursday for approval. The magistrate told Davis he was concerned
Bakker would go on television and talk about the case, but he issued
no formal request for Bakker to keep quiet.
   Bakker was silent during the hearing, but made a statement
afterward.
   ``I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment,''
Bakker said. ``The judge asked for no conversations about this case,
but I'd like to say that Tammy and I are thrilled to be back on TV.''
   The Bakkers began broadcasting ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' from
their leased home near Charlotte earlier this month. Bakker didn't
appear on the telecast Tuesday and his wife, Tammy Faye, handled the
program alone.
   Bakker quit the PTL ministry in March 1987 after admitting a
sexual encounter with former secretary Jessica Hahn and paying her
money to keep quiet. The ministry he founded wound up seeking
reorganization in bankruptcy court a few months later. Bakker tried
to raise money to buy back the ministry, but failed.
   Last month a Canadian businessman bought the ministry's assets,
including a Christian theme park, at a bankruptcy auction. The fate
of PTL's religious operation is unclear.
   In seeking the gag order, Davis presented Taylor with a copy of a
recent newspaper article in which retired U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Rufus Reynolds called Bakker a ``sawed-off little runt.''
   Taylor asked Davis if any of the comments made by Reynolds
focused on whether he felt Bakker was guilty or innocent of the
charges contained in the indictment.
   Davis responded affirmatively, saying Reynolds described his
client as ``a thief.''
   ``We can't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundated
with pre-trial negative publicity, especially from a federal
judge,'' Davis said. ``How can we prevent this? This guy is a loose
cannon. He's already gone overboard.''
   Davis said Reynolds' statements could have affect potential
jurors.
   ``This judge needs to be restrained,'' he said. ``He simply
cannot control himself. Just think of the dangers that this kind of
pre-trial publicity could cause.''
   Deborah Smith, a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor handling the
case, said the government was willing to agree to a consent order.
   ``The government is very concerned about the pre-trial
publicity,'' she said, adding that prosecutors also were considering
filing a motion for a gag order.
   Ms. Smith said prosecutors were concerned that Davis' request
might be part of a strategy to get the case moved. Outside the
courthouse, Davis declined to say whether he planned to ask that the
jury trial be moved out of Charlotte.
   Taylor tentatively scheduled the trial for the court's February
term but set no specific date. He also gave the attorneys 15 days to
file other motions, such as a request for a continuance.
   Bakker and three of his former top aides at the nearby PTL
television ministry in Fort Mill, S.C., were indicted Dec. 5 after a
16-month federal grand jury investigation into PTL's operation under
Bakker's leadership. The three have pleaded innocent to charges.

   A man fired several dozen shots from an

   ``We have at least 30 people that we've sent out to area
hospitals,'' said Police Chief Jack Calkins.
   The attack at Cleveland Elementary School came shortly before
noon. Other children were kept in their rooms, said John Klose,
Stockton Unified School District information officer.
   Police Sgt. James Monk said his office learned that a ``man went
berserk with an automatic weapon and we have several (people) down.''
   ``Several dozen shots were heard from an automatic rifle,'' said
Monk.

   Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III
deftly sidestepped most direct questions Tuesday at his Senate
confirmation hearing, including queries about when the United States
would resume nuclear arms control talks with the Soviet Union.
   But in his answers to questions from members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Baker made it clear that the
administration of President-elect Bush will largely adhere to paths
laid down by President Reagan, and will move cautiously when it does
depart from those policies.
   In the Middle East, in Central America, in South Africa _ all
trouble spots the new administration will be forced to grapple with
in its early months in office _ Baker disclosed no specific plans
for dramatic change, saying only that policies are under review and
that in some instances the Bush team will be open to new approaches.
   As the scheduled two-day hearing opened, committee chairman Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., urged Baker to press for quick resumption of
strategic arms control talks with the Soviets.
   ``There is no more urgent priority facing you than to continue
the momentum in arms control with the Soviet Union, most
particularly in the area of strategic nuclear weapons,'' Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the committee, said as Baker's
confirmation hearing opened.
   The START talks on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons have
been recessed since November, and the incoming Bush administration
is reviewing U.S.-Soviet relations, including arms-control
negotiating postures.
   Pell and other lawmakers urged that the START talks be resumed
quickly and without linkage to other negotiations, such as upcoming
multilateral talks on reductions in conventional forces.
   Baker was noncommittal, saying he could not specify a date by
which the talks will resume. ``We must take a hard look at our
negotiating position,'' Baker said, adding that Bush also will want
to review the nation's needs for strategic modernization.
   But he noted that Bush has ``made it very clear he wants to build
on the progress made to date,'' and added, ``It is my thought that
we should move forward with START talks without necessarily linking
them to anything else.''
   Opening the hearing, Baker read a statement calling for a new
relationship between Congress and the administration on foreign
policy, and promised more extensive consultation with Capitol Hill
than was evidenced during President Reagan's two terms. He asked
that Congress reciprocate.
   ``Yes, this is an appeal for a kinder, gentler Congress,'' Baker
said, borrowing from Bush's campaign-trail promise of a ``kinder,
gentler nation.''
   He said if partisanship and division on some thorny issues
continue, stalemate will be inevitable. ``When we held the line
together, on Afghanistan, or throughout the INF negotiations, we
succeeded. When we did not _ in Central America _ the outcome was
unsatisfactory to everyone,'' he said.
   He also called for renewed efforts to reach peace in the Middle
East, a strong international effort to rid the world of the threat
of chemical weapons and new efforts to address global environmental
problems such as the greenhouse effect.
   Baker, who was White House chief of staff during Reagan's first
term and treasury secretary in the second, has little direct
experience in foreign policy making. But his skill in dealing with
Congress and in negotiations are widely respected, and confirmation
seemed virtually certain.
   On U.S.-Soviet relations, Baker said he remains wary of apparent
moves by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to restructure and open
Soviet society. ``The Soviet Union remains a heavily armed
superpower,'' Baker said. ``The talk is different, but the force
structure and policies that support far-reaching interests and
clients have not changed commensurately.''
   Questioned about continued U.S. involvement in regional conflicts
around the world, Baker reiterated the new administration's
intention to continue U.S. support for the UNITA rebels in Angola
until ``national reconciliation'' is achieved and said the new
administration ``cannot and must not'' abandon the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   But in Nicaragua, he added: ``Clearly, we need a different
approach,'' perhaps including an economic development plan assisted
by European and Japanese allies.
   The standard for whether the United States will militarily
support rebel movements _ a policy that has come to be called ``the
Reagan doctrine'' _ will be whether the group is a broad-based
liberation group, national in scope, ``that expresses the will of
the people,'' he said.
   During questioning on a wide range of issues, Baker also said:
   _ That the new administration will undertake ``a full-scale
review'' of the issue of Third World debt. ``I believe there is room
for more creative financing mechanisms that can result in a
reduction in the stock of debt,'' he said, suggesting that
fundamental changes in the economies of debtor nations may be needed
as much as debt relief.
   _ U.S. attempts to pressure South Africa to abandon its apartheid
policy of official racism through economic sanctions have not had
the desired results. ``We need to review our policy in South
Africa'' and reach agreement with Congress on a unified plan, he
said. ``We ought to consider perhaps some creative ways to build
black institutions in South Africa.''
   _ A decision on a U.S.-approved Panamanian administrator for the
Panama Canal, due in 1990, will have to await developments there.
``I'm not sure it's in the best interests of the United States to
see us move forward down there under the current situation,'' in
which strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega continues to hold power
in defiance of U.S. efforts to oust him. ``It is difficult to make
progress on normalizing relations as long as Gen. Noriega remains in
charge.''
   _ The United States will recognize whatever government takes
power in El Salvador after the March elections, provided the
elections are ``free and fair and in the best democratic
tradition.'' He said the Bush administration will stand strongly
against any resumption of death-squad activity and might issue a new
warning to the Salvadoran government that such a resurgence might
lead to cutoff of U.S. aid.

<HEAD>US, Soviets Try to Settle on Old Russian Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and U.S. negotiators have begun trying
to settle the 70-year-old question of much Moscow should pay for
bonds issued by Russia's last czarist government.
   Until now, the Soviet governments of V. I. Lenin and his
successors have refused to pay anything for the bonds, which had a
value of $193 million when they were issued before 1919.
   Since then, unpaid interest has increased the total value of the
bonds to $862 million, according to the Treasury Department.
   The bonds were issued by the czarist government, but the last
czar, Nicholas II, was overthrown and shot in the 1917 revolution.
Lenin's government repudiated them two years later.
   Since then, the bonds were considered to have little or no value,
and were often valued more for the beauty of their engraving than
any hope they would be repaid.
   Carl Marks and Co., Inc., of New York, owns bonds with a face
value of $20 million. But Mark Claster, its chief operating officer,
says there is no market for them.
   ``You make a market,'' he told an interviewer. ``How much will
you give me? Five cents on $100?''
   Negotiations began in London between U.S. and Soviet diplomats in
London Nov. 28 and the two sides agreed to hold another meeting, the
State Department said. But Nyoka White, public affairs office for
the department's Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs, said she
did not know when or where it will take place.
   The Soviets have already made deals with Britain and Switzerland
on czarist bonds held by citizens of those nations. Making a deal
with the United States might make it easier to float new Soviet
bonds here, though Ms. White said there would be several legal
obstacles.
   One of those hurdles may be another $674 million the Treasury
still carries on its books from World War II, which is part of the
$9 billion cost of food and equipment sent to the Soviet Union under
the ``lend-lease'' plan of World War II.
   In addition, the Soviets also owe $109 million to the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, although the Soviets are keeping current on
those payments.
   Many European banks have opened new lines of credit for Moscow,
and some American banks, including the First National Bank of
Chicago, are interested in doing more business.
   These deals, which according to some estimates now reach $7
billion, evoked criticism from former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, who called them a potential aid to the Soviet military.
   ``These may be all going into production of better fertilizer,''
he said in a speech to business executives last month. ``The same
chemicals, however, are used for chemical warfare in many cases.''
   But Tony Zehnder, press relations officer for the First National
Bank of Chicago, said a distinction should be made between
short-term loans for trade deals and longer-term lines of credit
such as those being offered by banks in western Europe. He said his
bank is interested only in short-term deals.
   ``These aren't for missiles that are going to be used to bomb
Washington,'' he said in a telephone interview from his Chicago
office.
   First Chicago has agreed with a Soviet bank in London, the Moscow
Naordny Bank, to finance projects in the Soviet Union and other east
European countries.
   Zehnder says it plans to introduce the Soviet bank to its clients
who want to do business in the East.

<HEAD>Researchers Irked By Growing Community Resistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical research scientists are voicing
growing concern that their work on behalf of humanity is being
threatened by community activists unduly preoccupied with the effect
on the people down the street.
   The ``not in my backyard'' syndrome was debated Tuesday during
the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science.
   ``In the cases I examined, the community wants to have some
accountability if there are any health and safety implications to
the research,'' said Sheldon Krimsky, an associate professor of
urban and environmental policy at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.
   Community opposition to research facilities has blossomed with
increasing public concern over toxics, land use and other issues,
and with passage of tougher environmental laws, he said.
   But Syracuse University sociologist Allan Mazur disagreed at a
news conference on the ``not in my backyard'' syndrome.
   Mazur said such controversies have become common largely
``because of the journalistic coverage of them. It will get a lot of
sympathy.''
   During a Saturday night keynote address to the convention,
Stanford University president Donald Kennedy said scientists'
ability to solve society's problems is suffering as some
environmental and no-growth groups become ``enemies of scientific
progress.''
   ``We need a lot more stiffness in the face of special political
interests that are hostile to American science,'' Kennedy said,
calling San Francisco ``the nation's capital of activist,
single-issue and `not-in-my-backyard' politics.''
   On Tuesday, Stanford associate vice president Larry Horton
denounced what he called ``cynical manipulation'' of environmental
laws by animal rights activitists and others opposed to research for
non-environmental reasons.
   The extent of mutual hostility on the issue became apparent
during the news conference Tuesday.
   Hotel security police escorted community activist Margaret Verges
from the session after she claimed to be a reporter and launched
into a brief speech against the University of California's plans to
establish labs in a building it owns in San Francisco's Laurel
Heights neighborhood.
   She later accused scientists of being ``arrogant, hostile,
mean-spirited and unwilling to bargain.''
   George Carr, president of the Laurel Heights Improvement
Association, said homeowners oppose the University of California at
San Francisco research facility because it's an industrial use in a
residential neighborhood and because they fear it will harbor toxic,
radioactive, infectious and cancer-causing substances.
   The university disputes the allegations.
   ``The university has tried to push us in the press as ... local
dissidents opposed to science. That's a lot of bull,'' Carr said.
   He called biomedical research necessary, but added, ``One cannot
destroy the quality of life that the research is intended to
preserve.''
   Yet zoning laws often fail to address whether small research labs
should be allowed in residential zones, Krimsky said.
   He said cases of communities seeking to exert control over
research included studies of germ warfare agents, nuclear weapons
research, semiconductors and genetically engineered microbes that
would be released to the environment.
   But Horton indicated environmental concerns sometimes are
ridiculous.
   There was a ``hysterical'' reaction against pollutants from the
proposed building where Stanford wanted to house research rodents,
even though ``the most serious substance to be used was a cleaner
called Zonk to clean the cages,'' Horton said.
   Krimsky said scientific chaos could result if national standards
for experiments on animals and humans were superseded by local
standards. ``Researchers would move to the community where they
would have the easiest set of guidelines,'' he said.
   And the ultimate result, Mazur said, might be to drive
laboratories to poor areas without activist neighborhood groups.

<HEAD>Official Newspaper Says Leadership Can't Control Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deeply divided communist leadership
is unable to control the country's economic and political crisis,
and further social upheaval is imminent, a state-run newspaper said
Tuesday.
   ``The following is clear: this country is not being run by
anyone,'' the leading official daily Borba said in an editorial.
   ``More precisely, it is being run by divided, dangerously
antagonistic republican leaderships with different ideological
concepts, creating chaos in politics and economy,'' Borba said.
   Meanwhile, the ruling 23-member Politburo announced that on Jan.
25 the policy-setting Central Committee will ``discuss the political
situation in the country, relations within the party and the
functioning and responsibility of the Central Committee and its
Politburo.''
   The wording of the announcement, carried by the state Tanjug news
agency, indicated the session might result in leadership changes.
   In an apparent attempt to bridge the growing rifts between
Yugoslavia's republics, the nine-member state presidency on Tuesday
appealed to opposing leaderships ``to settle their differences by
dialogue.''
   Public discontent after years of rising inflation and falling
living standards, Borba said, ``is turning into a full-scale
revolt,'' threatening the very foundations of the communist system.
   ``The crisis is so deep that it can, at any moment, cause even
greater social upheavals, which would force the country into a
completely unwanted direction,'' the paper said.
   The most liberal republics of Slovenia and Croatia favor
political pluralism and more democracy as a solution to the
country's woes, but southern regions led by the country's largest
republic of Serbia advocate more central control and a greater role
for the Communist Party.
   The choice of a new premier later this week may cause yet another
sharp clash between the country's liberal and conservative regions.
   Tanjug said the worsening crisis calls for an emergency party
congress meeting to resolve conflicts and elect a completly new
leadership.
   ``It is better to have an extraordinary congress than to be
forced to introduce extraordinary measures,'' Tanjug said.
   The country's six republics and two provinces have wide autonomy
in political and economic affairs, creating eight virtually
self-ruling states that must reach consensus when passing important
new laws. That often leads to watered-down compromises.
   Yugoslavia is faced with confusion sometimes bordering on
``political chaos,'' Borba said.
   Unable to control the economic crisis, the federal Cabinet
resigned last month, leaving the country virtually ungoverned, the
Vecernje Novosti daily said.
   In addition, under pressure from hard-line Serbian Communist
Party chief Slobodan Milosevic and other Serbian leaders, the party
elites in the provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo and in the republic
of Montenegro have been ousted and only interim leaderships have
been left in charge of the regions.
   The ouster of the entire Montenegrin ruling elite came after more
than 120,000 people demonstrated last week in Titograd, the region's
capital, demanding the leadership step down because of the
disastrous state of the republic's economy.
   The action was applauded by Serbia's state-controlled media.
   But the mass demonstrations in Montenegro were denounced in the
liberal northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia and described as
being covertly ``orchestrated'' by followers of Milosevic, who is
alleged to have federal leadership ambitions.

<HEAD>Mayors Say Homelessness Increasing, Especially Among Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban homelessness and hunger increased
significantly in 1988, particularly among families with children,
the U.S. Conference of Mayors said Tuesday in reporting results of a
survey of 27 major cities.
   One of every four homeless persons in the surveyed cities was a
child.
   ``Families _ women and children _ they make up the most
significant increase we have experienced,'' Boston Mayor Raymond L.
Flynn said in releasing the findings.
   The conference, which conducts an annual survey of hunger and
homelessness, reported that both had risen in nearly all of the
cities it surveyed.
   The Senate Budget Committee chairman, Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
speaking to the mayors later, called the survey ``a devastating
indictment of the neglect of the needs of our major urban centers.''
He said the mayors had made a compelling case for increased spending
on the problems.
   Flynn said the rate of increase seemed to have slowed a bit from
the previous year, in part because of increased emergency services
provided by state and local governments.
   Officials in every city surveyed cited a lack of affordable
housing as the main cause of homelessness, and Flynn blamed a sharp
decline in federal spending on low-income housing during the Reagan
admininistration.
   ``Shelters are not the answer,'' Flynn said. ``Permanent,
affordable housing _ that is the answer.''
   The survey was released at the opening of the annual winter
meeting of the organization of big-city mayors. The survey was
conducted among the 27 cities whose mayors sit on the conference's
Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness, headed by Flynn.
   Among its findings were that in the past year in the surveyed
cities:
   _ Requests for emergency shelter increased an average 13 percent.
All but two of the cities registered an increase.
   _ Requests for emergency food were up an average 19 percent.
Three-fifths of those asking for emergency food were memebers of
families.
   _ An average of 19 percent of the requests for emergency shelter
went unmet; and among homeless families the figure was 23 percent.
Shelters in two out of three cities reported they turned away
homeless families because of a lack of resources.
   _ In 62 percent of the cities, emergency food assistance
facilities had to turn away people, also for lack of resources.
   _ On average the composition of the homeless population was 49
percent single men, 34 percent members of families, 13 percent
single women and the rest unaccompanied youth. One in four was a
child. An average 34 percent of homeless were substance abusers and
one-fourth were severely mentally ill; 23 percent had full-time or
part-time jobs; 26 percent were veterans.
   Flynn called for more federal spending on urban problems, and
said he was encouraged by President-elect Bush's stated commitment
to making homelessness a high priority.
   The Boston mayor said that by holding the increase in the defense
budget to the inflation rate in the coming fiscal year, an extra $4
billion could be made avilable for low-income housing and emergency
shelter programs. That would not solve the problem, he said, but
could at least pay for emergency shelter programs and get started on
increasing the availability of affordable housing.
   Bush's choice for secretary of housing and urban development,
Jack Kemp, is to meet with the mayors Wednesday.
   The survey was conducted among officials from Boston; Denver;
Louisville, Ky.; San Juan, P.R.; San Francisco; New Orleans; Kansas
City, Mo.; Nashville, Tenn.; Los Angeles; San Antonio, Texas;
Portland, Ore.; Salt Lake City; Minneapolis; Phoenix, Ariz.;
Philadelphia; Trenton, N.J.; New York; St. Paul, Minn.; Norfolk,
Va.; San Diego; Providence, R.I.; Hartford, Conn.; Charleston, S.C.;
Seattle; Chicago; Cleveland and Detroit.

   A man fired several dozen shots from an
automatic rifle in an elementary school Tuesday, killing five
children, wounding at least 35 other people and then fatally
shooting himself in the head, authorities said.
   ``We have at least one suspect in custody who has a gunshot wound
to the head,'' Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble said.
   The gunman died, said Lucian Neely, another deputy police chief,
said.
   Bruce Fernandez, spokesman for the county office of emergency
services, said six people had died.
   Ellen Rich at St. Joseph's Medical Center said eight victims were
being treated there, and said the total, including those being
treated at other hospitals, was 35 wounded.
   ``We have at least 30 people that we've sent out to area
hospitals,'' said Police Chief Jack Calkins.
   The attack at Cleveland Elementary School came shortly before
noon. Other children were kept in their rooms, said John Klose,
Stockton Unified School District information officer.
   Police Sgt. James Monk said his office learned that a ``man went
berserk with an automatic weapon and we have several (people) down.''
   ``Several dozen shots were heard from an automatic rifle,'' said
Monk.

   President Reagan has approved 10 pardons in
recent days, but has not yet decided whether to grant such relief to
newspaper heiress Patty Hearst Shaw and industrialist Armand Hammer,
an administration source said Tuesday.
   The source, discussing the subject on the grounds of anonymity,
said ``there are no big names'' among those for whom Reagan had
approved pardons. But the source would not identify the recipients.
   ``There may be as many as a couple of dozen that are before the
president,'' the official said, adding that consideration of pardons
for Shaw and Hammer is ``well along in the process.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, questioned earlier in the
day about the status of the Shaw case, said only that Reagan was
considering several pardon requests.
   ``It's certainly possible that a decision could be made before he
leaves,'' he said when asked whether Reagan would grant pardons
before he leaves office Friday.
   Although Fitzwater would not identify who had applied for
pardons, Reagan himself told reporters Sunday that he had asked
staff aides ``to look into the question'' of a possible pardon for
newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.
   Ms. Hearst was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for
her role in the 1974 armed robbery of a San Francisco bank.
   She now is married and living in Connecticut under the married
name of Patty Hearst Shaw.
   There's also a longstanding pardon request by industrialist
Armand Hammer, the head of Occidental Petroleum Corp., who was fined
$3,000 and placed on a year's probation in connection with his
guilty plea to three misdemeanor charges in connection with the
Watergate scandal of the early 1970s.
   Fitzwater said that several pardon requests, with recommendations
for action, had been sent to the White House by the Justice
Department in recent months. He wouldn't say how many are pending at
the White House.
   ``I won't comment on any individuals that are in this category,''
the spokesman said. ``Some of them are recent. Some of them, we've
had for weeks or for months.''
   Fitzwater said he had been told that Reagan ``doesn't have any of
these on his desk'' at this time.
   The administration official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that the pardon approvals ``tend to trickle over. ...
We got 10 back from the White House, approved, last week.''
   Under routine procedure, the Justice Department's pardons office
would contact the person getting a pardon or that person's attorney,
he said.
   Returning from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.,
Sunday, Reagan was asked by reporters if he was going to grant a
last-minute pardon to Shaw.
   ``All of this thing, I have asked everybody to look into this for
me,'' he replied.
   Shaw, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst,
last August quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the robbery.
She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical Symbionese
Liberation Army, a group of self-styled revolutionaries who abducted
her in Berkeley, Calif., in February 1974 and orchestrated the bank
heist.
   Shaw was convicted of charges connected with the robbery and
sentenced to seven years in prison. Her sentence was commuted by
Reagan's predecessor, President Carter and she was released from
prison on Feb. 1, 1979, after serving 23 months.
   In an interview Monday with The Advocate of Stamford at her
Westport, Conn., home, Shaw was asked whether she thought Reagan's
expression of interest in her case might result in a pardon.
   ``I don't know,'' she replied. ``It's a little premature for
anything like that. If he (Reagan) doesn't approve it, it would go
to the next administration.''
   Shaw, now 34, lives in Westport with her husband and two
daughters.
   Reagan has steadfastly insisted that he is not considering a
pardon for former National Security Council aide Oliver L. North,
who is scheduled to go on trial late this month on a variety of
charges related to the Iran-Contra affair. A federal judge late last
week granted a motion by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh
asking that two central charges against North be dropped.

   President Reagan intends to appoint Jerry S.
Parr, a former member of his Secret Service detail, as a member of
the advisory committee of the White House Conference on Library and
Information Services, the White House announced Tuesday.
   Parr, now the president of a private security consulting firm,
was the agent who pushed Reagan into his limousine after he was been
shot by John W. Hinckley on March 30, 1981.
   In recent weeks, the president has given key staff aides a number
of appointments to various government boards and commissions.
   Parr was credited with saving Reagan's life by ordering the
president's driver to take him to George Washington University
Hospital. Only after Reagan was examined by physicians did they
discover that Hinckley's bullet had lodged within inches of the
president's heart.

<HEAD>Pentagon Buying Old MiGs on Open Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has been buying older
Soviet-designed jet fighters and other Russian weapons on the open
market for the past year to test their effectiveness and to train
American servicemen, a military spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Jan Bodanyi, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said the purchases began
in early 1988 and so far have involved buying from international
arms dealers or private citizens Soviet MiG-15, 17 and 21 jet
fighters.
   The Defense Department also has bought Soviet air-defense
equipment such as radar systems with a view toward better training
American pilots, she added.
   The U.S. military has long conducted tests and experiments with
military equipment made in the Soviet Union, Warsaw Pact and Third
World countries and later captured, stolen or covertly purchased.
   The Pentagon had not acknowledged previously, however, that
efforts are now made to buy Soviet weaponry in an open manner in the
world's arms bazaars rather than to keep such transactions secret.
   Last September, the Pentagon announced the creation of a new
organization known as the Mobile Operational Test Force, set up by
the Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation Office, that receives
the Soviet equipment being purchased. Reporters were later allowed
to watch the new organization test some Soviet-bloc equipment at
Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M.
   Reporters were not told then, however, that much of the equipment
they were viewing _ including the MiG jet fighters _ had been
purchased through arms dealers and other ``non-covert'' sources.
   That acknowledgement came Tuesday only when the Pentagon
responded to a report by the trade publication ``Inside the
Pentagon,'' focusing on one aspect of the testing program.
   ``The Defense Department is purchasing Soviet and other `threat'
aircraft from commercial sources,'' said Bodanyi. ``It is a
continuing effort.''
   The spokeswoman acknowledged the Pentagon does not expect to find
the newest and most modern Soviet weapons for sale on the open
market. But she said that ``purchasing Soviet aircraft from
commercial sources is often three to four times cheaper than
modifying U.S. aircraft to Soviet characteristics.''
   ``In addition, openly acquired aircraft and equipment can be
tested openly by average U.S. servicemen, which adds to operational
testing realism,'' she said.

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle gave
unqualified support Tuesday to the controversial 50 percent pay
raise for Congress, federal judges and the Cabinet, acknowledging
however, ``I know it's a lot.''
   Quayle made his comments in an interview with The Associated
Press as a Washington Post poll showed that eight out of 10
Americans oppose raising the salaries of members of Congress from
$89,500 to $135,000.
   Quayle, who served four years in the House and eight years in the
Senate, appeared to take a somewhat different stand than his new
boss, President-elect Bush. On Jan. 6, Bush said he supported
President Reagan's endorsement of the 50 percent pay raise but added
he may take another look at the issue after becoming president.
   Bush, asked if the nation could afford such a big pay increase at
a time of huge deficits, said, ``Well, I don't know whether we can
afford anything than to get this deficit under control.''
   Quayle did not qualify his endorsement. ``I support President
Reagan's decision to send that up to Capitol Hill. I know it's a lot
but I think he thought long and hard. I support his decision.''
   The pay raise plan will take effect next month unless Congress
vetoes or modifies it.
   Under the proposal that Reagan endorsed, the president's salary
would rise from $200,000 to $350,000 and the vice president's would
go up from $115,000 to $175,000. However, the Constitution prevents
Bush from getting an increase for the term to which he was elected,
and presumably Quayle would be covered by the same prohibition.
   Quayle will be sworn in with Bush in ceremonies Friday. Quayle
said he will model his job after the way Bush performed it, refusing
to discuss publicly what they talk about in private. He said he
would not speak up in Cabinet meetings or when other people are
present, giving his views to Bush alone.
   ``He's going to rely on me for advice on things that he thinks
are important,'' Quayle said.
   He said everyone he's talked to who has been vice president _
including Bush _ said, ``don't get bogged down with trivia. Don't
get tied down with line-item assignments early on. There's always
going to be someone who says, `Well, this issue has come up, what
shall we do with it?' Someone will suggest, `Well, let's give it to
the vice president.'''
   Quayle said the assignments he takes on ``will be of substance,
stature and of importance to the president, and those assignments
will be forthcoming.''
   He said one thing he wants to do is to try to change the
stereotype image of the Republican Party as insensitive to the
plight of the poor and minorities. He said he would travel to inner
city neighborhoods, ``to hear them out, to get a feel, a
sensitivity'' about their problems.
   Acknowleding that the budget deficit will prevent new spending
programs, Quayle said, ``money's not everything.'' He said he would
use the tools of leadership and persuasion.
   Bush administration officials say the key foreign policy issue
facing the new president will be devising a strategy for dealing
with a Soviet Union that is rapidly changing under Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``My personal viewpoint is that Gorbachev is in a much stronger
position than (seen by) the conventional wisdom in this country,''
Quayle said. ``I think there are a lot of skeptics in this country
about him. I think he's in a very strong position.
   ``He's consolidated power much quicker than any other Soviet
general secretary. He's way ahead of (the late Leonid) Brezhnev. He
(Gorbachev) consolidated power in three years which took Brezhnev 10
years to do.''
   Quayle said he had not met Gorbachev but considers him ``a very
effective, capable leader (who) has an opportunity to do something.''
   Talking about Gorbachev's twin programs of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, and ``perestroika,'' or economic reform, Quayle said, ``I
think glasnost is for real. I happen to think that the Soviet
society today is more open than it has been in the past, that you
read publications today that you would not have read five years ago,
three years ago, 10 years ago. ...
   ``Perestroika on the other hand I'm personally a bit more
skeptical of. I think perestroika _ anytime someone tries to reform
the system, particularly that system, is just a consolidation of
power. I think Gorbachev's been very effective in the consolidation
of power.''

<HEAD>Arafat Rejects Elections For Occupied Territories</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday
rejected an Israeli suggestion for Palestinian elections in the
occupied territories and said a vote could be held only after the
Israelis leave.
   Arafat denied he threatened a Palestinian mayor on the West Bank
who proposed a truce in the Palestinian uprising. He also said the
Palestine Liberation Organization is cooperating in a probe to track
down the bomber of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Speaking at a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to
Finland, Arafat rejected the notion of elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip because the Palestinians had ``very, very
bad experiences of elections run by Israel.''
   ``The only elections which are acceptable are under the auspices
of the United Nations after the withdrawal of Israel,'' Arafat said.
   The last voting in the territories was in municipal elections in
1976, when candidates supporting the PLO were swept into office.
Many of the elected mayors later were deposed. Two were targets of a
Jewish underground and were maimed in bomb attacks.
   ``One lesson is enough,'' Arafat said.
   The Israeli Labor Party proposed an election to chose an
alternative leadership that could negotiate for the Palestinians,
but the Likud Party under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has been
cool to the idea.
   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, which it considers a terrorist
organization, and it has dismissed Arafat's declaration last month
renouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's right to exist as a
public relations ploy.
   Arafat denied he threatened Elias Freij, mayor of Bethlehem, who
suggested a truce in the 13-month uprising on condition that Israel
release Palestinian leaders.
   Freij, one of the few elected in 1976 still in office, withdrew
the proposal after a broadcast on Monte Carlo radio quoted Arafat as
saying:
   ``Any Palestinian leader who proposes an end to the intifadeh
(uprising) exposes himself to the bullets of his own people and
endangers his life. The PLO will know how to deal with him.''
   Asked about the broadcast by a reporter at a reception after the
news conference, Arafat said the radio ``misquoted me. I said if I
tried to stop the intifadeh the small boy who is standing beside me
would shoot me.''
   The uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories Israel
seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war, has left
at least 362 Palestinians and 15 Israelis dead.
   Arafat also said the PLO is cooperating to find who sabotaged Pan
American Flight 103, which blew up over Scotland on Dec. 21, killing
270 people.
   ``We are doing our best ... because this is an awful crime,'' he
said, declining to elaborate.
   He said 94 countries have officially recognized the state of
Palestine which the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, declared Nov. 15. He said he expected that
number to rise to 120 within a few weeks.
   On his second day in Finland, Arafat met members of Parliament
and leaders of the political parties. He held talks Monday with
President Mauno Koivisto, Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, and Foreign
Minister Kalevi Sorsa.
   The PLO leader left the Finnish capital Tuesday evening for an
unknown destination aboard an Iraqi airliner.
   In Tunis, Bassam Abu Sharif, chief Arafat spokesman, met the U.S.
ambassador to Tunisia briefly Sunday at a dinner given by the
British Embassy for visiting Foreign Office Minister William
Waldegrave, the Tunisian newspaper Assabah reported.
   Abu Sharif confirmed the meeting in the Tunisian capital and said
he discussed the situation in the Israeli-occupied territories with
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau.
   Pelletreau held his first official meeting Dec. 16 in Tunis with
a delegation of high-ranking of the PLO, which is based in Tunis.

<HEAD>Sununu Says Bush May Favor Defense Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incoming presidential Chief of Staff John
Sununu suggested Tuesday that George Bush favors an increase in
military spending near the 2 percent-plus-inflation level proposed
by President Reagan.
   The remarks, made by Sununu in a broadcast interview, appeared to
be at odds with earlier hints by Bush advisers pointing towards cuts
in Reagan's defense budget to make room for more spending for some
social programs.
   Sununu, in an interview on ``John McLaughlin's One on One,'' was
asked if Bush, like Reagan, wants a defense spending increase of 2
percent above inflation in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   ``I think somewhere around that range,'' Sununu responded.
   The interview for the syndicated television program was taped on
Tuesday to be aired on Sunday.
   Bush, through his campaign and in statements after the election,
voiced a desire to expand spending for some social programs,
including education, the Head Start program, child care and
environmental cleanup.
   In the past, neither Bush nor any of his top aides have indicated
where, in relation to the final Reagan budget submitted last week,
the Bush administration would stand on defense spending.
   Bush has said he will propose his own overall budget
modifications to Congress several weeks after his inauguration
Friday morning.
   ``I think the question before Congress right now, and the (Bush)
administration is looking at in the budget they're going to present,
is what level of growth from the budget ought to be maintained (for
defense) and how that growth is related to inflation,'' Sununu said.
   Reagan, in his final budget, proposed defense spending authority
of $315.2 billion for fiscal 1990, up from $298.8 billion in the
current fiscal year.
   That's an overall increase of 5.5 percent and takes into account
about a 3.5 percent increase in the inflation indicator used for
defense calculations.
   Bush has proposed a ``flexible freeze'' in overall spending,
which would hold the total growth in spending to the rate of
inflation, with Social Security benefits being exempt.
   Thus, every increase above inflation would have to be offset by
corresponding cuts in other programs.
   Going along with the Reagan proposal for an increase in spending
of 2 percent over inflation would make it even harder for Bush to
carry out his proposal for a ``flexible freeze'' without new taxes,
while getting the federal deficit to below the $100 billion level
required by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.
   Sununu said growth in revenues to the Treasury in the coming year
would help Bush meet his goals.
   Still, he conceded, ``we're going to have a very spirited and
lively set of budget discussions with Congress.''
   Bush, meanwhile, spent the day in a series of staff meetings and
news interviews and also spent some time working on his inaugural
address, according to spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   She said he is now working on a second draft of the speech
shorter than the draft he had earlier in the week.
   ``He said he wanted it under fifteen minutes,'' Ms. Tate said.

   Angry Israeli soldiers told
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday that they were being robbed
of their civilized values because they were forced to mistreat
Palestinians.
   Their statements reflected growing concern in Israel that the
13-month occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is having a
brutalizing effect on the morals of Israeli troops.
   One after another, eight reservists rose to confront Shamir as he
toured Nablus and visited an army tent camp outside the West Bank's
largest city, which has 120,000 Arab residents.
   The soldiers, in their late 20s and early 30s, said they had
beaten innocent people to instill fear in them and enforce order.
Several said they were ashamed of their actions and had difficulty
facing friends and loved ones when they returned home.
   ``The basic values we grew up on changed whether we like it or
not during our service here. Every day children are being hurt,''
said Capt. Ronnie Carmelli. ``The chief of staff (Lt. Gen. Dan
Shomron) said it would take time. But the time is long and the price
is high.''
   Three Palestinians died in the occupied lands Tuesday, raising to
362 the number of Arabs killed in the revolt.
   Shamir said he would take the soldiers' comments into
consideration, but that protesters who threw rocks and bottles want
to end Israel military presence in Nablus and Israel's existence as
a state.
   ``We hate those PLO people because they make us kill Arab
children. We don't want it,'' he said.
   ``They force us to bear arms, but we must do that to survive.
Sometimes you have to fight for your human values.You have to have
faith. You do any important job,'' said Shamir, a hawk who has
advocated tough measures for putting down the revolt.
   Shortly before he arrived at the encampment, gunfire could be
heard in the city, which has become a major battlegroud for
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers.
   The soldiers patrol the narrow winding streets of the Casbah,
Nablus' marketplace.
   ``In order to enforce order in the marketplace, we must be
brutally violent to innocent people,'' said a reservist who
identified himself only as Yotam, a laborer from Tiberius.
   ``When I get up in the morning, I say to myself, `Now I have to
go out and chase somebody' ... and when I catch him I look at his
hands and see he is a working man, just like me.
   ``I have to slap him or beat him (with) murderous blows to get
him to fear me. It wears me down as a person. It breaks me. These
are not the values I grew up on.''
   After eight of 50 soldiers spoke, Shamir thanked them for being
frank and called for patience.
   ``The very fact that you carry out your mission, and then can
talk about your concerns ... shows that your values are not
eroding,'' he said.
   When Shamir told reporters he did not believe the comments
reflected the opinions of all troops, a reservist interrupted and
shouted: ``Yes they do.''
   Another soldier approached reporters later and said those who
spoke out did not represent the entire unit.
   Shomron, who escorted Shamir to the tent camp, appeared
embarrassed by the attacks on Shamir and excused himself in the
middle of the meeting.
   Before leaving, Shomron told the soldiers: ``The army's mission
is to enable the politicians to (solve the problem) from a position
of strength. ... It is your job as military men to fulfil the
mission, regardless of your individual views and concepts.''

<HEAD>Dispute Over `Propaganda' Label</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Reagan administration lawyer on Tuesday
defended the government's attempt to label some political
documentary films ``propaganda'' when approving their tax-free
export, saying the label is informative, not disparaging.
   But a lawyer for independent filmmakers told a federal appeals
court that the labeling was ``an informal system of censorship.''
   The argument before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
involved the U.S. Information Agency's latest attempt to review
thousands of documentaries each year for their content before
approving them as ``educational, scientific or cultural,'' which
allows their tax-free export under a treaty signed by 72 nations.
   The agency's first regulations, which rejected films that
advocated viewpoints or were deemed to misrepresent a government's
policy, were declared unconstitutional by the 9th Circuit last year.
   The current regulations would require a film to be primarily
factual in its approach, to be based on a ``reasonably current
state'' of available information, and to acknowledge the existence
of opposing viewpoints.
   They would also allow the USIA to tell other countries that a
film, though approved as educational, was ``propaganda'' in that it
was designed to promote a political, religious or economic
viewpoint. The foreign government could then decide whether to
approve tax-free imports.
   The regulations were challenged by the makers of six documentary
films. Four, on subjects that include the dangers of uranium mining,
disarmanent and Agent Orange, were denied USIA approval; one, on
drug use among urban youth, had been rejected under the earlier
standards but was approved under the new standards; the sixth, a
sympathetic portrayal of the 1979 Nicaraguan revolution, was
approved but given a ``propaganda'' label.
   U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima of Los Angeles rejected the
new standards last May and ordered the USIA to draft a third,
content-neutral set of standards while giving provisional approval
to the films. Justice Department lawyer Wendy Keats asked a
three-judge panel Tuesday to reverse Tashima's ruling.
   The 1954 treaty, known as the Beirut Agreement, requires
governments to evaluate films based on their contents, Ms. Keats
said. She said the Constitution does not prohibit a
viewpoint-neutral assessment of whether a film is presented in a
factual manner, or a non-coercive statement that it is propaganda.
   ``On its face, the propaganda label does not either disparage a
film or prevent it from being circulated,'' Ms. Keats said.
   She said the label merely encourages foreign governments to take
a second look at a film. Claims of censorship are ``unduly
patronizing (to) foreign governments,'' she said.
   But the filmmakers' lawyer, David Cole of the Center for
Constitutional Rights, said the label was not simply neutral
information, but an attempt to get foreign governments to deny
tax-free import of films that should qualify under the treaty. He
said Canada has already declared that it would not accept U.S. films
with ``propaganda'' labels.
   ``The USIA has said ... they don't want these films to have
benefits,'' Cole told the court. He called the labeling ``an
informal system of censorship.''
   U.S. government ``propaganda'' labels on some imported films were
allowed in 1986 by the Supreme Court, which observed that the labels
did not prevent anyone from seeing the films. But Cole said the
current case is different because the labels are intended to stop
foreign circulation of the films.

<HEAD>Arab Americans Invited To State Department To Discuss Arafat Visa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Arab American officials have been invited
to the State Department to discuss the possibility of granting a
visa for PLO chief Yasser Arafat to visit the United States, an
Arab-American group said Tuesday.
   The president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee,
Abdeen Jabara, and the chairman of its board, former senator James
Abourezk, were asked to meet next Monday with an aide to Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Murphy, said the group's spokesman, Faris
Bouhafa. The aide, Ned Walker, deals in Middle Eastern affairs.
   ``The stated purpose of the invitation was to discuss an Arafat
visa,'' Bouhafa said.
   State Department officials confirmed that such a meeting had been
set to discuss the results of Abourezk's meeting with Arafat last
week, but declined to discuss the question of a visa for the PLO
chief.
   Arafat last Friday accepted an invitation from Abourezk to
address the ADC's annual convention on April 13 in Washington, the
ADC said. Abourezk met in Tunis, the PLO headquarters, with Arafat
as well as with the PLO's executive committee.
   He also met with U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau, who has
been conducting a newly launched dialogue with the PLO.
   The State Department and the White House said Tuesday they had
not received any applicationfrom Arafat for a visa. If it comes,
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, ``we will consider it
very carefully. We won't say in advance what we'll do.''
   Secretary of State George Shultz rejected a visa request from
Arafat last November, citing concerns about the PLO's involvement in
terrorism. But subsequently, President Reagan authorized a dialogue
with the PLO when it recognized Israel's right to exist and
renounced the use of terrorism.
   Arafat has visited the United States only once _ in 1974 to
address the United Nations. His visa at the time was limited to New
York.
   Washington's prestigious National Press Club last year extended
an invitation to Arafat to address the forum, but the PLO said it
could not obtain a visa for him to come to Washington.

   President Reagan will award the Presidential
Medal of Freedom to former U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield and to
Secretary of State George Shultz, a White House spokesman said
Tuesday.
   Reagan will present the awards at a White House luncheon on
Wednesday, said Marlin Fitzwater.
   Mansfield, recently retired as ambassador to Japan, and Shultz
``are being honored for their many significant contributions in the
fields of national interests, public services and world peace to the
United States,'' Fitzwater said.
   The medal is the highest civilian award of the U.S. government
and is awarded to people who have made ``especially meritorious
contributions,'' Fitzwater said.
   The president will also award the Presidential Citizens Medal to
three Republican members of Congress on Wednesday, the spokesman
added.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, House Minority Leader
Robert Michel of Illinois and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., will
receive the medals Wednesday morning at a White House ceremony,
Fitzwater said.
   The medals recognize citizens ``who have performed exemplary
deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens,''
Fitzwater said.
   Later in the day, the White House released the following list of
citizens who will also receive the Citizens Award, including
Reagan's chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein, his national security
advisor Colin Powell and actor Charton Heston. The others include:
   David Abshire; Richard Armitage; Arnold O. Beckman; James Scott

   Lloyd M. Bentsen Sr., an early developer
of Texas' Lower Rio Grande Valley whose son was the Democratic
vice-presidential candidate last year, was killed in a traffic
accident Tuesday. He was 95.
   The father of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen died in a two-vehicle collision
after apparently failing to yield the right of way at a rural
intersection between Edinburg and Mission near the Mexican border,
said Police Chief A.C. Gonzales.
   The senior Bentsen remained active in his farming, ranching and
real estate interests until his death.
   ``He was here two or three times a week, sometimes every day,''
said Bud Williams, foreman for the past 25 years at Bentsen's
16,000-acre La Coma Ranch in Hidalgo County, one of six ranches
Bentsen owned. ``He was one of the biggest developers down here,
cleared thousands of acres.''
   Bentsen was on the podium during much of last summer's Democratic
National Convention, where his son was named the party's vice
presidential candidate.
   The senator's Washington office said he left immediately for
Texas after learning of his father's death.
   In Austin, Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby said he would ask Gov. Bill
Clements to order flags flown at half-staff the day of Bentsen's
funeral.
   Clements said Bentsen was ``a great Texas entrepreneur who
contributed much to the people of our state, particularly those in
South Texas.''
   House Speaker Gib Lewis said: ``I hope that when I obtain that
age that he obtained, that I'll have the same outlook, the same
health and the spirit that he had. He was a great Texan.''
   Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman David Wells said
Bentsen was pronounced dead at the accident scene by Justice of the
Peace Juan Rosel of Mission.
   Wells said Bentsen apparently failed to yield the right of way at
a stop sign to an eastbound car on Highway 107 on Tuesday morning.
   Two people injured in the second car were Ramiro Rosalez, 22, and
his sister Margarita, 19. Ramiro Rosalez was released after
treatment for cuts and bruises at Mission Hospital, said hospital
spokeswoman Linda Thayer.
   Ms. Rosalez was admitted in stable condition and was undergoing
surgery Tuesday, the hospital spokeswoman said.
   Bentsen held nearly 50,000 acres of farms and six ranches
scattered over a South Texas empire he started carving out of the
brush and thorns in 1920.
   In his final years, Bentsen continued living at a residence on
Bentsen Road near Mission, and was up at dawn every day and on the
road to his real estate office or one of the farms and ranches in
Hidalgo and Starr counties.
   He and his wife, Dolly, who died in 1977, had four children:
Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr.; Kenneth, a Houston architect; Don, a McAllen
businessman; and Betty, the wife of Lower Rio Grande Valley
businessman Dan Winn.
   The senior Bentsen, one of six children of Danish parents, grew
up thrashing wheat and busting wild horses in the South Dakota
Badlands. He had little schooling, leaving his studies at 13 to
follow the grain harvests.
   He and his early partners bought and tamed wild mustangs trapped
in the canyons of the Dakotas, paying $3 a head and selling them for
$12.
   By the 1970s his holdings ranged from farm, cattle, oil, gas and
nursery operations to control of six banks, stock in other banks and
land sales entimated at $1 million a month. Although he had sold his
bank holdings, Bentsen continued farming, running 5,000 head of
cattle, operating a nursery, taking in oil and gas revenues and
managing a real estate business.

   George Bush labored Tuesday to trim his first
speech as president into more sermonette than sermon, as the capital
and an estimated 300,000 celebrants made ready for an inauguration
extravaganza that won't leave much else to moderation.
   Congress, meanwhile, accorded a warm reception to Bush's closest
confidant and senior Cabinet appointee, James A. Baker III, who at
confirmation hearings pleaded for a partnership between the
executive and legislative branches in the conduct of America's
foreign policy.
   Baker, sure to win approval as secretary of state, said the first
order of business should be ``a meeting of our minds on how to
proceed with the Soviet Union.'' The task, he said, ``is to arrange
affairs so that whatever the outcome of perestroika, a more
responsible, constructive foreign policy will remain in Moscow's
interest.''
   The new Soviet leadership also was on the mind of Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle, who told The Associated Press in an
interview Tuesday that Mikhail Gorbachev ``is in a much stronger
position'' than many American skeptics believe. ``He's consolidated
power much quicker than any other Soviet general secretary,'' said
Quayle.
   Quayle said also that one of the things he wants most to do in
his new role is work to change the image of the Republican Party as
insensitive to the plight of minorities and the poor. He said he
intends to travel to inner-city neighborhoods and ``hear them out,
to get a feel, a sensitivity about their problems.''
   Elsewhere in the capital, thousands of performers, from Hollywood
heart-throbs to high-school majorettes, rehearsed for scores of
inaugural events. The first will be a twilight pageant and fireworks
spectacular at the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday.
   The leading man remained in the cutting room, trying to reduce
the length of the address he will deliver Friday at noon, upon
taking office as president. He aimed at ``something in the range of
15 minutes or less,'' said spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   The speech was drafted by Peggy Noonan, the principal author of
Bush's Republican convention acceptance speech last summer and a
contributor to President Reagan's nationally broadcast farewell last
week.
   Bush sent her ``back to the drawing boards'' on Monday, and was
working with her again Tuesday to tighten it, Ms. Tate said.
   Bush could do worse than aim for brevity when he mounts the
Capitol's West Portico Friday to take his oath beneath the winter
skies. One president, William Henry Harrison, droned on in an icy
downpour for nearly two hours, caught pneumonia and died.
   George Washington delivered the briefest inaugural address, after
taking the oath for his second term. It totaled 135 words.
   Wednesday's opening for the five-day inaugural whirlwind, an
outdoor affair, is to be attended by Bush and Vice President-elect
Dan Quayle. It will feature a wingtip-to-wingtip flyover by 21 Navy
combat jets, in a salute to a new commander-in-chief who flew 58
combat missions over the Pacific for the Navy in World War II.
   The show also will include music from the Gatlin Brothers and the
Beach Boys and will culminate in a massive fireworks display
lighting the sky with 1,000 electric-white bursts, in keeping with
the ``thousand points of light'' theme of Bush's campaign.
   Later in the evening, matters turn far more pricey _ and
exclusive _ for the Bush faithful, with three black-tie dinners
going at $1,500 per seat.
   But affairs of state also took their place.
   Baker was expected to return to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on Wednesday for a second day of questioning about the new
administration's foreign policy. Confirmation hearings were
scheduled Thursday for Elizabeth Dole as labor secretary and Richard
Darman as budget director.
   Baker told the Senate panel Tuesday that ``Bipartisanship does
not mean that we must always agree'' on foreign policy. ``But
eventually we must proceed, and when we do it is best that we do so
together.''
   Baker was cordially received, and got a strong introduction and
endorsement from Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a fellow Texan and the
Democratic candidate for vice president last fall.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that Baker
and other cabinet appointees ``are generally experienced, hopefully
pragmatic people, and we won't have the rigid ideology of the first
Reagan term.'' He added that ``I am trying very hard to establish
from our side an atmosphere of cooperation and bipartisanship.''
   Washington bustled as Bush's big day neared. Hotels were filled
with fat-cat revelers, and workers scrambled to finish construction
of inaugural exhibits, platforms and reviewing stands. The overall
pricetag: an estimated $25 million, mostly raised from ticket prices
and sales of souvenirs.
   But that doesn't include the labor and other contributions from
special-interest groups and ordinary volunteers eager to play a part
in the festival marking America's changing of the guard. A display
on the city's mall, for example, includes five-story-tall replicas
of the Statue of Liberty and George Washington's ``rising sun''
chair, each erected by a Buddhist lay organization.
   Street vendors hawked Bush-Quayle sweatshirts for $12. A
``Republican integrity'' button, with pictures of Bush, Reagan,
Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, went for $5.
   The official inaugural committee mailed catalogs to 1.5 million
Republicans, offering items ranging from packets of chili spice,
$2.50, to crystal statuettes for $1,200. A terrycloth bathrobe with
the inaugural seal goes for $75.
   The biggest money-maker of all is the black-tie entertainment
gala scheduled for Thursday night at the cavernous Washington
Convention Center, where TV and Broadway star Nell Carter captured
the Republican mood Tuesday with a sizzling practice rendition of
her opening number: Fats Waller's ``This Joint Is Jumpin'.''
   The show, to be televised live by CBS at 8 p.m. EST Thursday, has
a cast of 1,100 performers representing a cross-section of American
entertainment, including ballet dancers Susan Jaffe and Mikhail
Baryshnikov, singers Frank Sinatra and Anita Baker, and the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir. The sold-out gala is expected to gross $9 million,
including $4.9 million in television money. Ticket revenues include
$25,000 for each of 90 eight-seat boxes.

<HEAD>Education Department Investigating Whether Harvard, UCLA Use Asian
Quotas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are exploring whether Harvard
and the University of California at Los Angeles use illegal quotas
to restrict the number of Asian-American students they admit, an
official said Tuesday.
   The U.S. Department of Education has been collecting and
analyzing statistical information on admissions at the two schools
since last fall, said department spokesman Mahlon G. Anderson.
   He declined to say what sparked the probe. No conclusions have
been reached, he said.
   Both Harvard and UCLA deny using quotas for any ethnic groups,
and both schools point to a significant rise in enrollment of
Asian-American students.
   At UCLA, Asian-Americans make up 22.9 percent of the freshman
class, up from 17.8 percent in 1980. At Harvard, the number of
Asian-American freshmen roughly tripled over the past decade, from
4.8 percent in 1978 to 14.2 percent this year.
   By comparison, the U.S. population is only about 2 percent Asian.
However, Education Department officials say Asian-Americans tend to
be high academic achievers and have been applying to top colleges
and universities in rising numbers.
   ``The real issue is not whether the number of Asian students is
going up, but what percentage of qualified applicants is being
accepted,'' said Frederick H. Dow, director of the Asian-American
Resource Workshop, a non-profit educational group in Boston.
   Harvard, for example, acknowledged last year that over the past
decade it had admitted an average of 17 percent of all white
applicants, but 13.3 percent of Asians applicants.
   Anderson said the Education Department will review the data and
send investigators to question officials on both campuses, probably
before the end of the current school year.
   ``Statistics alone don't always tell the story,'' he said. ``...
When you talk to admissions officers, you understand there may be
non-discriminatory policies that are driving the data and creating
certain patterns.''
   William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's director of admissions, said
Asians tend to be slightly stronger than whites on academic criteria
and slightly weaker on extracurricular activities, which can count
against them because Harvard seeks students with diverse talents,
such as music, art and leadership.
   In addition, he said, relatively few Asians in the applicant pool
are children of alumni or prospective varsity athletes. ``When all
those factors are taken into account, the difference in admission
rates for the two groups disappears,'' he said.
   Eva Lum, a Harvard senior and co-president of the Asian-American
Association on campus, said Harvard has had Asian students working
in the admissions office to recruit Asian-Americans, especially from
low-income families, for four years.
   ``It would be counterproductive to do that and impose quotas at
the same time,'' she said.
   UCLA stopped qualifying Asian-Americans for affirmative action
when it became clear that they were overrepresented, not
underrepresented, in proportion to population, said Thomas Lifka, an
assistant vice chancellor responsible for admissions.
   Lifka said 35 percent of Asian applicants were admitted in 1988,
compared with 32 percent of whites.
   ``We are convinced that if the Department of Education looks at
the data carefully ... they will conclude that there is no
discrimination.''
   If the department determines a college or university
discriminates on the basis of race or ethnicity, it can block
federal grants and guaranteed student loans which amount to hundreds
of millions of dollars for major schools.
   But Anderson said the schools are first given an opportunity to
change their disputed practices, and most do so.

   A train collided with a bus taking
children home from school Tuesday and dragged it 50 yards. Police
said 41 people were killed and 72 injured, and the death toll might
rise.
   School books, shoes and pencils were strewn along the track and
inside the demolished bus.
   ``Bodies were scattered all over. Children were screaming,'' said
a Buddhist monk who helped carry victims to ambulances and other
rescue vehicles.
   Witnesses said the driver of the bus, which was carrying about
120 people, tried to cross the track ahead of the train but his
engine stalled.
   Police said the driver escaped with minor injuries and five
children riding on the steps jumped to safety. No one on the train
was hurt.
   A woman said she saw the train approaching the unguarded crossing
and believed the bus driver could not see it through a light
drizzle, so she tried to flag him down but was ignored.
   Most of the dead and injured were taken to the Civil Hospital at
Balapitiya village, about five miles from the accident. Twenty-five
bodies were sprawled on the floor and tables of its three-room
morgue.
   Three infants were among the dead. One lay on a morgue table
beside a woman's body, but nurses did not know whether she was the
mother.
   Other bodies, many badly mutilated, were on the floor awaiting
identification.
   A wailing mother searched the hospital for a daughter who had
been on the bus.
   ``Inoka! Inoka!'' she called out. Her two other children trailed
along and nurses ran after her, trying to steer her away from the
morgue.
   Most of those on the bus were children. It had picked up pupils
from four schools at Amblangoda town and was was bound for
Urgasmanhandiya village about 10 miles away when it came to the
crossing at Ahungalla, 50 miles south of Colombo.
   Ahungalla is the halfway point of the bus route, which runs about
30 miles from Altugama to Galle.
   Two brothers, Rohan and Duminda Kumara, were on one hospital bed,
watched over by their father. The boys said they escaped with minor
injuries to their legs because they were riding on the steps.
   Chandrika Fernando, a nurse, said the more seriously injured were
taken to a larger hospital at Galle.
   Police officer K.M.M Keerthisinghe said at the hospital he did
not have a breakdown of the casualties by age group, but at least 70
of the dead or injured were children.

   Linda Marchiano, known as Linda Lovelace
when she appeared in ``Deep Throat'' and other hard-core sex films,
is supporting a local anti-pornography law facing a federal
challenge.
   Marchiano has claimed in her book ``Ordeal'' that she suffered 2{
years of physical, sexual and mental abuse while being coerced into
performing sex acts and appearing in sex films.
   The Bellingham law that Ms. Marchiano supports says pornography
violates the civil rights of women when it portrays them as
dehumanized sexual objects. It differs from many anti-pornography
statutes in that it sets up civil remedies instead of criminal
penalties.
   The law is being challenged by a local bookstore, three
Bellingham residents and others who argue that it is vaguely written
and would have an overly broad impact on work protected by the First
Amendment.
   In a Jan. 6 affidavit, Ms. Marchiano said she wants to file a
lawsuit in Whatcom County seeking damages and an injunction against
any showing of her films there.
   ``Every time someone watches those films, they are watching me
being raped,'' Ms. Marchiano's affidavit said. ``Every time I am
recognized from those films, I am violated again.''
   In the hope of preserving her chance to file a lawsuit in
Bellingham, Ms. Marchiano, a New York state resident, is asking U.S.
District Judge Carolyn Dimmick to let her join the defendants in the
federal court lawsuit.

   Leftist guerrillas Tuesday
launched coordinated attacks on military positions in six northern
towns, the armed forces and the rebels reported.
   The armed forces said three rebels were killed and three soldiers
wounded in the battles before dawn in the northern province of
Chalatenango. The guerrillas said they caused 25 casualties among
army troops, but did not specify the number of dead and wounded.
   The rebels, who commented on the clandestine Radio Farbundo
Marti, did not mention their own losses. The radio, like the
Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front that has been
battling the U.S.-backed government for nine years, is named for a
1930s revolutionary.
   The armed forces press office, as well as the clandestine
guerrilla radio, reported fighting in and around the towns of Dulce
Nombre de Maria, El Refugio, La Laguna, San Ignacio and San Miguel
de Mercedes. The rebels also staged what the army called
``harassment'' attacks on positions around the 4th Infantry Brigade
headquarters at El Paraiso, 28 miles north of San Salvador, the
capital.
   The insurgents said the coordinated attacks were part of an
operation called ``In response to repression, the people and
militias prepare the insurrection.''
   Rebel forces also blew up three utility posts near Apopa, seven
miles north of the capital, causing temporary blackouts in the
capital and some northern sectors of the country.

<HEAD>US Reviewing West German Chemical Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sale of a California high-technology
company to a West German chemical firm is being reviewed by a
government task force in the first test of a new law that allows the
president to block foreign purchases of American companies on
national security grounds.
   The case involves the proposed sale of Monsanto Electronic
Materials of Palo Alto, Calif., to Huels AG of West Germany.
   The American company, an operating division of the giant Monsanto
chemical company headquartered in St. Louis, produces silicon
wafers, the flat discs used to make computer chips.
   Silicon wafers are the building blocks for the semiconductor
industry, a sector of the U.S. economy considered vital not only for
national security reasons but also for trade reasons. America's edge
in the battle with foreign competitors has centered in such
high-technology fields as computer manufacturing.
   The proposed sale to the West German company was reviewed in a
closed-door meeting on Tuesday by the Committee on Foreign
Investment. The committee is composed of officials from eight
government agencies and is headed by David C. Mulford, an assistant
Treasury secretary.
   The panel has until next Monday to forward a recommendation to
the president. It is expected the proposed sale will be one of the
first trade issues that President-elect Bush will have to face.
   Originally, the Commerce Department and the Defense Department
raised questions about the proposed sale. However, an attorney
representing Monsanto said Tuesday he believes the original
objections had been dealt with.
   ``We have met with (government officials) on numerous occasions.
We answered all of the questions and repeat questions,'' said
Washington lawyer Joseph F. Dennin.
   Earle H. Harbison Jr., the president of Monsanto, and Carl
Krauch, the chairman of Huels, a subsidiary of the giant West German
conglomerate Veba AG, both met with officials from various agencies
on Tuesday.
   ``There is no credible evidence that Huels, an exemplary company
from a NATO ally, would so something that would injure the national
security of the United States,'' Dennin said.
   Officials at the Commerce Department said no announcement of the
panel's recommendation would be released before it was reviewed by
the president, who has 15 days under the law to reach a decision on
the panel's findings.
   The review of foreign takeovers of U.S. companies on national
security grounds was included in the giant Omnibus Trade Act of
1988. Congress had become concerned that the wave of foreign
purchases of U.S. companies could be endangering national security.
   Three other U.S. producers of silicon wafers have been sold to
Japanese firms in the past four years and the sale of another U.S.
silicon wafer supplier, the wafer division of Cincinnati Milacron
Inc. to Osaka Titanium of Japan is pending.

   Winds gusted to 90 mph in the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday, while
some flooding was reported in Arkansas.
   Morning winds gusted to 63 mph near Denver, 65 mph at Ames
Monument, Wyo., 69 mph at Squaw Mountain, Colo., and 90 mph just
south of Rollinsville, Colo.
   Snow showers continued in northern New York and Vermont into New
Hampshire. Snow, with blowing and drifting snow, fell over eastern
Upper Michigan and northern Lower Michigan, extending to the
northern half of Minnesota.
   A few rivers were flooding or threatening to flood. The Angelina
River in eastern Texas was expected to crest near Lufkin. Lowland
flooding continued along the Ouachita River at Camden, Ark., and
along the Cache River near Patterson, Ark. The St. Francis River at
Lake City, Ark., was more than 3 feet over its banks, but the river
level was falling.
   West Palm Beach, Fla., tied a record high for the date of 85
degrees. Des Moines, Iowa, reached 56 degrees to break its high
temperature record for the date.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 1 degree
above zero at Gunnison, Colo., to 82 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla.,
Miami and West Palm Beach, Fla. The low temperature for the nation
Tuesday morning was 27 degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Wednesday, the forecast called for snow squalls over the
lower Great Lakes, northern Indiana, lower Michigan and eastern
Upper Michigan. Rain was expected to be scattered along the Texas
Gulf Coast. Snow showers over northwest Montana were to turn into
rain in the lower elevations and reach across the northern Pacific
coast. Winds were to be strong and gusty over the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were expected to be near 20 degrees over
northern Maine; in the 20s over Upper Michigan, northern Minnesota,
eastern North Dakota and the central Rockies; in the 30s and 40s
from southern Maine across Maryland, the northern Appalachians, the
lower Ohio Valley, the remainder of the Great Lakes, southern
Minnesota to northern Missouri, the remainder of North Dakota across
northern Kansas and the upper Missouri Valley, over the remainder of
the Rockies, through the plateau and the northern Pacific coast; in
the 70s over much of the Florida Peninsula, the lower Texas Gulf
Coast and from southern Arizona across southwest California. High
temperatures over much of the remainder of the nation were to be
generally in the 50s and 60s.

   In a small apartment about a mile from
Communist Party headquarters in Warsaw, two excited Solidarity
activists tuned into the latest TV reports of a party meeting they
believed would result in a decision to legalize the banned labor
federation.
   Rarely have the long speeches at a Central Committee plenum
commanded such close attention from Solidarity, which for seven
years has tried the party's patience by refusing to abandon the
fight for legal existence.
   ``Are they registering Solidarity yet?'' yelled Jan Litynski,
spokesman for the Warsaw region of Solidarity, to former underground
Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak.
   Bujak had just flipped on the television switch in another room
on the first day of the party debate on the future of Solidarity. He
did not reply.
   The answer was not immediately forthcoming as party members
heatedly debated for hours on Monday and Tuesday over a move to
legalize Solidarity.
   The party had reason to be nervous. In 1980-81, during
Solidarity's legal existence, an estimated 1 million party members
joined the independent union movement. Thousands more turned in
their party cards in disgust when Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, imposed martial law on Dec. 13, 1981.
   But on Tuesday Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski urged the
party to legalize the banned union on condition that it be ``a
partner,'' not an opponent that would ``pull the country into
anarchy.''
   Rakowski had vigorously defended the martial law decision in the
early 1980s.
   The reversal in policy arises from the party's failure to
eradicate Solidarity after the martial law crackdown and reflects
the authorities' need to gain support from society to push through a
program of radical economic reform.
   ``They (party leaders) are doing this because they realize they
have to and it was obvious they had to,'' said Litynski, a veteran
opposition activist who advised striking miners during Poland's
worst labor unrest in seven years last August.
   Although the shift in the party's attitude is welcome, some
Solidarity activists believe the union must proceed with caution
because the change results from necessity rather than good will.
   ``The authorities will do whatever that have to do to stay on
top. Let's wait and see what they have to say and read the fine
print carefully,'' said Maciej Jankowski, a Solidarity leader at
Warsaw University.
   Solidarity activists do not foresee a return to the heady days of
1980-81, when union work was a round-the-clock passion for many. But
they acknowledge that a return of legal existence would change their
lives.
   ``It would be a real tragedy for my family. I don't have any
children now and I won't have time for that with all my union
activities,'' said Bujak, who first drew national attention when he
became leader of Solidarity's Warsaw region in 1980 at the age of 26.
   Litynski, who has long dreamed of visiting the United States,
believes he may have to postpone any visit if Solidarity is
legalized.
   For Jankowski, regulation of the labor federation's status means
he would be able to focus on solving other problems.
   Jankowski spent Tuesday afternoon taking part in a rally at
Warsaw University in support of legalizing the Independent Students'
Union and Solidarity.
   While Solidarity is eager to resume its activities legally, that
status poses challenges to union leaders such as how to organize the
labor federation and how to achieve economic reform.
   But a return to legal existence would mean that many could
finally emerge from the shadows of underground publishing and from
church basement meetings into a more normal way of participating in
public life.

   A passenger of a car pulled over for
speeding on the New Jersey Turnpike was shot and killed Tuesday in a
scuffle with a state trooper, authorities said.
   The driver of the car was arrested, and a second passenger was
being sought by state and local police on foot and in helicopters,
said state police spokesman Capt. Thomas Gallagher.
   Trooper Robert K. Henig, 26, pulled over a luxury car with North
Carolina license plates about 12:30 p.m. because it was speeding,
Gallagher said.
   Henig told one of the passengers to leave the car and asked for
his identification. While the man searched his pockets, Henig
spotted what he believed to be a small bag of marijuana inside, the
spokesman said.
   The man then pushed Henig down and ran toward a marshy highway
median, Gallagher said. Henig caught the man, subdued him and was
putting his gun into his holster when the man kicked him, he said.
   ``There were a number of shots fired,'' said Gallagher. ``When
the weapon was turned toward the trooper, a shot was fired. He then
turned the gun on the suspect and fired.''
   Shortly afterwards, a car was stolen from a restaurant parking
lot less than a half-mile away, said State Police Capt. Thomas Carr.
Police were trying to determine whether the missing man stole the
car, he said.
   Police tentatively identified the dead man as a 46-year-old North
Carolina resident who was on parole for two bank robbery convictions
in that state in 1976 and had moved to Hackensack in October,
Gallagher said. The driver was identified only as a 37-year-old
Greensboro, N.C., man. He was taken into custody, but no charges had
been filed by late Tuesday.
   Police withheld the two men's names while verifying their
identities, Gallagher said.
   The trooper was not injured in the scuffle, Gallagher said.

   The judge called inmates to
testify Tuesday about a report that confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi cheered when told in prison last month that a Pan Am
jetliner had crashed.
   Hamadi denied the report, and the witnesses did not corroborate
it.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger called two men from Preungesheim
prison to answer questions about Hamadi's reaction to the Dec. 21
bombing over Scotland of Pan Am Flight 103, which originated in
Frankfurt and changed planes in London. All 259 people aboard and 11
people on the ground were killed.
   Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 1985
hijacking of a TWA jet to Beirut, during which U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17
days. He has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denies
killing Stethem.
   Mueckenberger said he wanted to clarify a report telephoned to
him by a prison official that Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem,
cheered when he heard of the Pan Am crash.
   The first witness, who identified himself as Klaus Wilhelm
Helfinger, said he remembered Hamadi being especially boisterous
after news of the crash.
   ``Hamadi's cell is directly next to mine,'' he said. ``I was in
cell 28 and he occupies 27, and he did a lot of shoan be named this
month.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Sen. Gordon Allott, who
during 18 years in the Senate helped push through water projects
instrumental to the economic development of Colorado and Arizona,
died of cancer Tuesday. He was 82.
   Allott died at Swedish Medical Center, where he was hospitalized
Dec. 27, medical center spokeswoman Beverly Jacobsen said
   Allott, a Republican, held public office for much of his adult
life, culminating in his three terms in the U.S. Senate from 1955 to
1973. He was thwarted in his bid for a fourth Senate term by
Democrat Floyd Haskell in the 1972 general election. Allott lived in
Englewood in recent years.
   Born in Pueblo on Jan. 2, 1907, Allott graduated from the
University of Colorado in Boulder in 1927 and from its law school in
1929.
   In 1930, he moved to Lamar, where he practiced law and became
Prowers County attorney. He also served terms as Lamar city
attorney, district attorney and lieutenant governor from 1951-55,
when he also served as vice chairman of the state Board of Parole.
   During World War II, Allott was a major in the Army Air Corps.
   During his tenure in the Senate, Allott served on the
Appropriations and Interior committees. He was the Senate sponsor
for the Colorado River Basin Storage Act of 1968, which provided for
construction of five Colorado water projects and the Central Arizona
Project. The House sponsor was the late Rep. Wayne Aspinall, a
Democrat, with whom Allott worked closely.
   ``They got beat the same year (1972) at the start of the
environmental age,'' said former Colorado Gov. John Vanderhoof.
``But thank God for them because they cinched the future for
Colorado.''
   Allott is survived by his wife, Welda, sons, Roger of Aurora and
Gordon Jr. of Littleton, and three grandchildren.
   A funeral was scheduled for 1 p.m. Friday in Denver.

   Israel said Tuesday it will do all it can to
stop West German firms from helping Libya build a poison gas plant
and promised massive retaliation if Libya uses chemical weapons on
Israel.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres planned to raise the issue during a
visit to Bonn beginning Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
   The United States has charged that West German companies helped
Libya build a chemical weapons factory south of Tripoli. Libya
maintains the plant will make pharmaceuticals.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens also said he planned to confront the
Bonn government about the West German companies' suspected
connection to the Libyan plant.
   Arens told Israel radio: ``The fact that Germany has been
involved on such a large scale in supplying equipment ... to be used
to establish a chemical weapons capability in Libya, a country that
insists it is at war with Israel, is an abhorrent thing to us.
   ``We will do everything we can to put an end to it.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would use every means
to defend itself against Libya, which he described as one of the
Jewish state's most dangerous enemies.
   ``Whoever would dare to use this kind of weapon against Israeli
military units or Israeli civilian targets will be clobbered 100
times if not more. Israel will not tolerate ... the use of this kind
of means against us,'' Rabin told Israel radio.
   West Germany is investigating allegations of West German
involvement in the Libyan plant.
   ``We believe the German government should strengthen supervision
and overcome existing loopholes in dealing with this delicate and
complex matter,'' the Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, acting as a police
intermediary, appealed Tuesday for the surrender of a rapist who has
attacked seven women in the subway.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said O'Connor was asked to make
the public appeal after police received two calls to the 911
emergency line from a man who identified himself as the subway
rapist. The man said he would surrender if a personal appeal from
O'Connor was televised.
   ``Please, please, not only stop what you are doing, but for your
protection and for the protection of possible victims, please turn
yourself in to the police authorities,'' O'Connor said as reporters
and television cameras recorded his words at a hastily called news
conference.
   O'Connor promised the suspect would not be mistreated: ``You have
my word, given me by them, that you will be treated properly and
given complete justice in every respect.''
   Ward said the caller admitted he was a crack addict.
   ``He is apparently a very troubled person. He said he is sorry
for what he did and he said he feels that he is getting a little bit
out of control,'' Ward said.
   Ward said he was convinced the calls, which came in Monday at
12:45 p.m. and Tuesday at 10 a.m., were legitimate.
   Last February, a man claiming to be the bomber of an abortion
clinic made a request for a TV appeal from O'Connor. After
O'Connor's appeal, Dennis Malvasi surrendered and pleaded guilty to
dynamiting a clinic and planting a bomb that was defused before it
exploded at another. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.
   ``Clearly there is hope that this may be a similar situation,''
O'Connor said.
   The suspect now being sought by police is accused of raping or
sodomizing four women and attempting to sexually assault three
others over the past five months.
   In each case, the man forced a woman either off a train or a
subway platform at gunpoint or knife-point and into the subway
tunnel, where the attacks occurred.

   Western nations criticized the human
rights records of some East European countries Tuesday, singling out
harsh police actions the United States called a ``glaring
contradiction'' of international commitments.
   At a conference of foreign ministers, outgoing Secretary of State
George P. Shultz coupled praise for the Soviet Union's new openness
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with criticism of some of its
allies.
   He was more direct than most West European ministers, attacking
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania by name for
police crackdowns on dissidents and persecution of minorities.
   Shultz and his colleagues gathered at the end of a 27-month
conference to review the 1975 Helsinki agreements on European
security and cooperation, including human rights. The Helsinki
accords were signed by 35 countries: the United States, Canada and
all European nations except Albania.
   Delegates had barely adopted their final document Sunday when
Czechoslovak riot police crushed a rally in Prague.
   The police used water cannons and tear gas again Monday and
Tuesday on dissidents honoring Jan Palach. The 20-year-old student
burned himself alive Jan. 16, 1969, to protest the Soviet-led
invasion of the previous August that ended Czechoslovakia's brief
``Prague Spring'' liberalization.
   In Leipzig on Sunday, East German police arrested scores of human
rights demonstrators.
   Shultz departed from his prepared text Tuesday to declare the
police actions ``in glaring contradiction to the solemn
international commitments'' just made in Vienna by those governments.
   Romania told delegates to the review conference Sunday, before
adoption of the final statement on human rights and security, it
would not honor provisions on greater religious freedom and
emigration.
   Shultz did not raise that issue specifically, but criticized
Romania for increasing repression and shortages of food, heat and
power endured by its 23 million citizens.
   ``In Romania the economic and social conditions, as well as the
political and civil rights of all citizens, are being eroded at a
discouraging rate,'' he said, ``and in both Romania and Bulgaria,
minorities have been particularly hard hit by government policies of
recent years.''
   He praised the Soviet Union for a nine-year high in Jewish
emigration and release of more than 600 prisoners of conscience, but
noted that ``others continue to suffer repression or remain unjustly
imprisoned for acting upon their human rights.''
   ``We cannot forget them,'' he said.
   Both the Kremlin and the West have praised the agreement, which
provides for new negotiations on reducing conventional military
forces, formation of groups to monitor compliance with human rights
agreements, and for greater freedom of travel, emigration and
information.
   Announcements that the Soviets will begin a unilateral withdrawal
of 50,000 troops from Eastern Europe in April strengthened hopes
that the talks set for March in Vienna will lead to reducted
conventional forces on the continent.
   Shultz said, however: ``We have a long way to go yet to achieve
real peace in Europe.''
   At a news conference, the secretary called the Berlin Wall, ``an
inhumane structure'' symbolizing the repression of the Soviet bloc
and said it should be torn down.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, in another tough speech
focused on human rights, also called for destruction of the ``Cold
War anachronism'' built by the Soviets and East Germans in 1961.
   ``It is the most public symbol of the divide between freedom on
one side and its denial on the other,'' Howe said. ``The Berlin Wall
mocks all our work to remove barriers to contact and understanding.''
   Howe also spoke of Britain's agreement in Vienna to attend a
human rights conference in Moscow in 1991, which the Soviets have
sought for some time.
   But in London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher deplored the
violent break-up of Czech demonstrations and threatened to boycott
the conference unless the Soviets make sustained progress on human
rights.
   Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament many Britons ``were somewhat
dismayed'' by television scenes showing peaceful demonstrations
being ``forcibly broken up.''
   ``I think it fully justifies the approach that we took on the
human rights conference in Moscow, that we would not go unless
certain strict criteria were met,'' she said.
   The Women's Campaign for Soviet Jewry, a British group opposed to
the Moscow conference, heckled ministers as they arrived for
Tuesday's meeting.
   ``You sold out Soviet Jews too cheaply!'' Joyce Simpson and
Elizabeth Philips shouted as Shultz arrived.
   Howe said Britain would continue monitoring the Soviet human
rights record and would attend the conference only if reform was
translated into Soviet law and Britain is ``convinced that Soviet
commitment to change is genuine and irreversible.''
   Foreign Minister Alois Mock of Austria spoke out against
repression in the East bloc, as did Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway,
Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands and others.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union was
to arrive in Vienna on Wednesday and speak Thursday.

   A citizens' watchdog group formed after Miami's 1980
race riots Tuesday called for punishment of the white policeman
whose fatal shooting of an unarmed black man touched off violence in
the city's Overtown section.
   ``The people believe it's open season against blacks,'' said the
Rev. Carlton Coleman of New Providence Church, member of the People
United to Lead the Struggle for Equality, or PULSE.
   The group called for a speedy investigation into the Monday night
shooting, firing the police officer who did the shooting,
first-degree murder charges against him, removal of the heavy
concentration of police officers from Overtown, and formation of a
countywide Citizens Independent Review Panel.
   The FBI announced Tuesday that it would investigate Monday
night's shooting to determine whether there were civil rights
violations, Miami bureau spokesman George Kiszynski said. He said
the investigation would be completed ``as promptly as possible.''
   The Rev. Nathaniel Graham, pastor of St. Stephen AME Church and a
PULSE member, called the shooting ``nothing new. ... We knew it was
going to erupt. It was only a matter of time. The same thing could
happen tomorrow. The atmosphere is out there.''
   PULSE, which has representatives from some 50 groups, most of
them black community churches, has been alleging heavy-handed
treatment by police against blacks for years. Clarence Pendleton,
the late U.S. Civil Rights Commission chairman, said last year that
he would look into their complaints, but the group never received
any results, members said.
   PULSE listed 17 earlier incidents, six of them resulting in
deaths, in which Miami or Metro-Dade police allegedly used excessive
violence against blacks, starting with the 1979 beating of black
insurance executive Arthur McDuffie. The acquittal of the white
Metro-Dade officers charged in McDuffie's death sparked Miami's 1980
riots that claimed 18 lives.
   City and police officials have said PULSE has made unfair
allegations. The group leaders, in a news conference joined by
relatives of some of the listed victims, said this week's
disturbances should show it's time for their advice to be taken.
   ``They (police) have turned a deaf ear,'' said the Rev. Vance
Eubanks of Greater New Bethelem Church. ``It's as if we're throwing
words to the wind. Now we're going to reap the whirlwind.''
   They said they wanted police to do their jobs, but to be
sensitive to the community mood and not appear so heavy-handed.
   ``We have stood side-by-side with the police force. We would be
the first ones to ask for law and order,'' Eubanks said.

<TEXT>
   Local fishermen
threatened to confront a large French trawler on the high seas
Tuesday in a bitter dispute over fishing rights around this French
territory off Canada's Atlantic coast.
   Yvon Dodeman, president of the fishermen's union, told reporters
a trawler from St. Pierre and Miquelon was called into port to
prepare for action against the factory freezer trawler Grand Hermine.
   The 6,000 people living on this rocky archipelago 10 miles south
of Newfoundland rely almost entirely on fishing for their
livelihood, with cod the main catch. A compromise last fall allowed
one factory ship from France to fish in the zone, but the arrival of
two touched off tensions once again.
   The fishermen charge the factory ships take in too many fish and
don't provide any employment at the territory's fish processing
plants.
   Michel Auzou, captain of the Grand Hermine, said his ship as well
as the other trawler, the Coma Peche, will not move out of the
fishing zone around the islands known as 3PS unless they are forced
to.
   ``For a week now we've been insulted and attacked, we never once
answered back,'' the captain said in an interview with French radio.
   ``It's over now. We've been humble for too long,'' he said.
``We're not leaving the zone now. The decision has been taken on
both trawlers.''
   He pointed out that French fishermen have been operating in the
area for centuries.
   Earlier in the day, St. Pierre Mayor Albert Penn said Paris
officials agreed to move the Grand Hermine out of the zone so talks
could begin between French Premier Michel Rocard and a delegation
from the islands.
   There was no immediate comment from the Paris government.
   ``The union will take action if the trawler doesn't follow the
government's instructions,'' said Dodeman. ``They will prepare the
boat to go against the Grand Hermine on the 3PS.''
   Dodeman said it will take about six hours for the local trawler,
Croix de Lorraine, to reach St. Pierre's harbor.
   He would not say what action the fishermen had in mind. In recent
weeks some fishermen have threatened to ram the large factory
freezer trawler or shoot the radar equipment on its bridge.
   On Sunday, fishermen blocked planes carrying 60 French police
reinforcements from landing.
   More than 1,000 people turned out Monday night for a public
meeting and voted to accept the French government's offer for talks
in Paris about fishing rights in the region.
   Penn, who is also the territory's senator to France's Senate,
said a delegation would go to Paris on condition the French
government agrees to tie up one of the two trawlers at St. Pierre
harbor.
   Penn said the Paris government agreed Tuesday that a French naval
tug anchored off St. Pierre will carry a local observer and stay
with the trawler Grand Hermine to monitor it.
   In St. John's, Newfoundland, the two French military planes that
had tried to bring in police reinforcements to St. Pierre and
Miquelon on Sunday flew out Tuesday morning. Their flight plans were
filed to Paris.
   St. Pierre residents, some armed with rifles, surrounded one
plane that landed Sunday but allowed it to take off after four
hours. The second plane circled overhead before also flying to St.
John's.
   Canada and France have a longstanding dispute over fishing quotas
and the islands' international boundary. Canada long has complained
of French over-fishing.
   Canada and France disagree over the international boundary of the
islands and quotas for fish in nearby waters. France claims a
200-mile economic zone, but Canada recognizes only a 12-mile limit
around the islands.

   Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the widow of the
former Nationalist Chinese leader, has been hospitalized for two
weeks with fever and flu, newspapers reported Tuesday.
   The Chinese-language Min Sheng Pao quoted an unidentified doctor
at Veterans General Hospital in Taipei as saying that Madame Chiang,
90, was admitted because she had a ``slight fever and flu.''
   The China Times Express carried a similar report about Madame
Chiang, the former Soong May-ling.
   The hospital's president and vice president both declined comment
on the reports.
   Chiang Kai-shek led the Nationalist government on the Chinese
mainland during World War II but was forced to flee to Taiwan after
losing a civil war to the Communists in 1949. He led the
Nationalists on Taiwan until his death in 1975.
   Madame Chiang once wielded influence in China second only to that
of her husband. She remains widely respected.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has agreed to foreign
currency exchange with some East bloc allies and may lower its
domestic exchange rates as a prelude to full convertibility in world
markets, an official said Tuesday.
   The deputy chairman of State Bank of the U.S.S.R, V.A. Pekshev,
told a U.N.-sponsored conference on U.S.-Soviet trade that Soviet
officials acknowledge the need for full convertibility of the ruble
but must proceed slowly.
   ``By Jan. 1, 1990, we would make a 100 percent increase in the
ratio'' of the official domestic exchange rate, Pekshev said, in
effect doubling the amount of rubles exchanged for other currencies.
   ``Is this a currency devaluation?'' he said. ``We won't get into
theoretical arguments on this question.''
   The Soviet Union has several sets of exchange rates for domestic
and foreign products, and it was not known how the proposed increase
would affect the rates. Black market exchange rates are often six to
seven times higher than the official rates.
   More than 100 Americans and Soviets, including U.S. and Soviet
envoys to the world body, began the two-day meeting Tuesday, the
first such conference held under U.N. auspices.
   U.S. and Soviet speakers focused mainly on Soviet economic
reforms and repeatedly expressed optimism about improving relations.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``perestroika,'' or restructuring, has led to an explosion of
cooperative business ventures and the relaxation of some
restrictions on foreign trade.
   But ventures have been stifled by the inconvertibility of the
ruble in foreign exchange markets and by the need to operate through
the Soviet state bank, which takes as much as 60 percent of hard
currency earnings from each transaction.
   Western media have reported the possibility of changes in the
official rate, which currently brings about $1.60 per ruble. One
Soviet official has said convertibility could result in a 10-fold
devaluation in the ruble.
   Pekshev dismissed the 10-fold figure as speculative and said
officials were considering ways to move to full convertibility
``stage by stage.''
   ``We're not in a position today to assert a new value of the
ruble to the dollar,'' he said.
   He said Soviets ``have agreed to partial convertibility'' with
several East European countries and were planning hard currency
``auctions'' for Soviet and East bloc enterprises to buy the foreign
currency needed for trade with the West. Foreign businesses
initially will not be allowed to participate, he said.
   The conference is scheduled to end Wednesday afternoon, two days
before President-elect George Bush's inauguration. Bush aides have
said they are planning a wide-ranging review of U.S. policy toward
the Soviet Union before deciding on a new agenda for relations under
Bush.
   Exports to the United States jumped from $214 million in 1982 to
$446 million the next year and were projected to dip slightly to
$445 million in 1987, according to U.S. figures. U.S. exports to the
Soviet Union decreased from $3.4 billion in 1984 to a projected $1.3
billion in 1987.
   Another statement said the U.S. State Department had agreed to
extend visas for Soviets wishing to continue meeting with American
corporations after the conference ends.
   Among the U.S.-based participants in the meeting were Duco
Akkerman, vice president of Dow Chemical Europe S.A.; Wilhelm
Braxmaier, vice president of Eastern European Motorola Inc.; F.E.
Cassidy, director of international development for the U. S. oil
company Tenneco Inc.; and Harvard University economist John Kenneth
Galbraith.
   Soviet officials also included the deputy minister of external
economic relations and head of the Soviet delegation, Y.N. Chumakov;
Deputy Oil Minister L.I. Filimonov; Viktor Ponomarev, the Soviet
trade representative; and Soviet U.N. Ambassador Alexander Belonogov.

   A 10-year-old boy arrested for selling
crack on a street corner on Long Island was ordered held Tuesday at
a children's shelter because he had failed to show up in court on
two previous arrest warrants.
   The youngster, wearing blue jeans with a rolled-up comic book in
his back pocket, began to cry when court officers led him away in
handcuffs following the 30-minute hearing.
   A 14-year-old accomplice, arrested with him on Sunday on
drug-selling charges, was released in the custody of his mother
following his arraignment Tuesday.
   Suffolk Family Court Judge Donald Auperin ordered the 10-year-old
boy detained despite a plea from his mother that she would see to it
that he returned for his next court appearance.
   Auperin told the woman that her son had failed to show up on two
outstanding arrest warrants even though she also had been subpoenaed.
   The boy's court-appointed attorney, Douglas O'Connor, entered an
innocent plea on the youth's behalf.
   The mother left the courtroom sobbing after watching her son led
away.
   The boy was ordered held at the Nassau County Children's Shelter
in Westbury until his next court hearing on Jan. 20.
   The 14-year-old, who has an outstanding arrest warrant for
allegedly stealing a bicycle, was ordered to appear in court March 2.
   Both youngsters were arrested after they had been observed by
police allegedly dealing drugs on a street corner in Wyandanch, a
town of 18,000 people about 60 miles east of New York City.
   As the youths tried to flee, the 10-year-old dropped a bag
containing three crack vials worth $20 each, police said. One of the
youths also had $226 in cash in his pocket, police said.
   Suffolk police said they are seeking a suspect who is believed to
have hired the boys to sell the drugs.
   Family Court proceedings are usually closed to the public but
Auperin opened the arraignment after reporters argued for the
public's right to know. The judge ordered that the identities be
kept private. He also did not disclose details of the two arrest
warrants against the 10-year-old.

<HEAD>Teen Held For 11 Days Because He Could Drive Stick Shift, Police
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCALA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager was held hostage by two prison
escapees during an 11-day, 4,000-mile crime spree because he could
drive with a stick shift and they could not, a sheriff's spokesman
said Tuesday.
   Ted Siegel, a 16-year-old honor student, was kidnapped Jan. 3 by
two escapees from the Marion County Correctional Institution and
released unharmed Saturday night near Baltimore, officers said. He
returned home safely to Florida just before midnight Monday.
   Authorities were still searching for the accused abductors,
Patrick Hughes Paige, 21, and Anthony James Cokley, 22.
   Siegel's kidnappers couldn't drive a manual transmission car and
failed in several attempts to steal another car, Marion County
sheriff's spokesman Ken Ergle said at a news conference Tuesday. So
they kept Siegel as their getaway driver as they staged robberies in
eight East Coast states, he said.
   The teen-ager did not attend the news conference.
   While Siegel was running an errand for his mother in the Ocala
area on Jan. 3, he was choked nearly unconscious, shoved into his
family's 1987 Dodge Omni and ordered to drive north on Interstate
75, Ergle said.
   The kidnappers committed robberies and burglaries in Georgia,
South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and New York, the spokesman said. The FBI says most of
the robberies occurred in New Jersey.
   ``The car was a very important part of the crime spree because
there were several failed attempts to steal another car,'' he said.
   ``They were concerned about the manner in which the car was
driven,'' said Ergle. ``Paige attempted to drive for about 100
miles, but the two became frustrated and did not want to attract
attention.''
   Ergle said Siegel told investigators he had made up his mind to
do everything he could to protect the car.
   ``This car was a very important part of their life. They had
saved money ... and Ted felt a real strong responsibility to his
mother and his family at whatever the cost to return home with that
car,'' Ergle said.
   The vehicle was last seen with the kidnappers, who dropped off
Siegel near Baltimore.
   During the burglaries, Siegel was ordered to stay in the car and
the keys were taken from him. The three slept in woods, shopping
centers and parking lots during the 11-day odyssey, often going long
stretches without food.
   The teen-ager told investigators he was allowed to call his
mother from a convenience store near Atlanta to say he would be
freed in a few days.
   ``I prayed every day and it seemed to work out,'' Siegel said
after arriving home.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for John Hull, an
American charged with drug and weapons trafficking, said she will
ask the judge in the case to move proceedings to Hull's hometown in
northern Costa Rica.
   Hull, who has been linked to an illegal arms-supply network
aiding the Nicaraguan rebels, was arrested at his ranch last
Thursday. Officials said he also was being investigated on charges
of spying for the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras.
   Attorney Elda Zuniga said Hull, who suffers from diabetes, became
ill on Monday and was sent to the infirmary at the San Sebastian
Jail, where he is being held. The jail is in San Jose, the capital.
   Hull's condition improved and he was back in his cell Tuesday,
Ms. Zuniga said. She did not say why Hull became ill.
   Ms. Zuniga said she will ask Judge Leovigildo Rodriguez of the
4th Federal District Court to order the proceedings moved to San
Carlos, about 105 miles north of San Jose. Hull's ranch is in nearby
Los Chiles.
   The judge will decide on the request during an open hearing
scheduled for Friday, Ms. Zuniga said.
   The Office of Judicial Investigations acted after residents near
Hull's ranch denounced activities by Hull that they believed could
endanger relations with Costa Rica and Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government, an official with the office said.
   The Attorney General's Office formally charged Hull on Friday.
   Hull, about 69 and a former Indiana resident, has lived in Costa
Rica for 20 years. Ms. Zuniga said he became a naturalized Costa
Rican citizen eight years ago, when he moved to Los Chiles.
   Ms. Zuniga said she would move for dismissal of the drug charges
because they were based on alleged incidents that occurred in 1984,
about three years before Costa Rica's legislature approved an
anti-narcotics trafficking law upon which the prosecution is based.
   ``According to our Constitution, Article 34, no citizen can be
accused of things that occurred before 1987, the year in which the
legislative assembly approved the narcotics law,'' she said.
   Hull has denied any drug trafficking connections. He said in 1986
that authorities twice raided his home in unsuccessful attempts to
find evidence of gun running and drug smuggling.
   Hull has acknowledged permitting the Contras to use his ranch
property for their activities before the Iran-Contra case broke in
1986. In the case, Reagan administration officials sent arms to Iran
for money to be sent to the Contras.
   Witnesses testifying before Congress on illegal arms shipments to
the Contras have said Hull's ranch was a way station for gun
smugglers and cocaine traffickers.
   Hull was not among 13 men indicted in September in Miami on
charges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reports
said Hull was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case.

<HEAD>Meese Violated Ethical Standards, Justice Department Report Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Adds 2 grafs of reax from Wallach attorney</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department concluded Tuesday that
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III violated federal ethics
standards five times in six years and that his relationship with E.
Robert Wallach ``dictated government action'' in major cases.
   Meese's assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and his
efforts on behalf of a proposed Mideast oil pipeline involved
``three instances in which friendship'' between him and Wallach
caused federal actions, said the report by the department's Office
of Professional Responsibility.
   Wallach, who collected $1.3 million from Wedtech from 1982 to
1986, is awaiting trial in New York on racketeering and other
charges. He is accused of peddling his Meese connection.
   ``As a direct result of the preferential, improper efforts of
Meese and his staff, the Army'' awarded a $32 million
engine-building contract to Wedtech in 1982 while Meese was
counselor to President Reagan, said the ethics report on Meese.
   Meese also violated ethics requirements, the report said, by
failing to report a stock sale on his 1985 federal tax return and by
participating in a Justice Department decision favoring the regional
Bell telephone companies in which he held $14,000 in stock at the
time.
   If Meese were still attorney general, ``we would recommend (to
the next ranking department official) that the president take
disciplinary action,'' the report concluded.
   A department statement said no further action against Meese is
warranted because he is no longer a government employee.
   Independent counsel James McKay decided last summer not to
prosecute Meese, although McKay concluded Meese had probably twice
violated conflict-of-interest laws in connection with his Bell
holdings and had violated tax laws in connection with failing to
report the stock sales.
   McKay's report ``far from vindicates Mr. Meese,'' said the new
Justice Department report. ``It details conduct which should not be
tolerated of any government employee, especially not the attorney
general of the United States.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh disagreed with one aspect of the
report, saying that Meese's failure to dispose of his financial
interest in the regional Bell companies resulted from a failure to
get adequate legal advice rather than from intent to violate ethics
standards.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Reagan believes ``this report was unnecessary, partly because Mr.
Meese has not been in the office for some time and partly because it
was unwarranted.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan believes his longtime friend did nothing
wrong.
   The former attorney general, who resigned last year, immediately
attacked the report through his attorneys, who called it ``a
travesty of justice.'' Meese spokesman Patrick Korten said there is
an ``emotional undertone'' to the report that seems designed ``to
slam him personally.''
   At a news conference, Thornburgh declined to defend his
department's Office of Professional Responsibility from criticism by
Meese's supporters that the report was a personal attack on Meese.
   ``I think Mr. Meese is entitled to some peace,'' said Thornburgh.
   Thornburgh tried to avoid characterizing the OPR report in any
way, but ultimately called one of its conclusions ``clearly wrong''
and said there is an adequate factual basis for the others.
   Thornburgh disagreed with the conclusion Meese violated ethical
standards when he failed to sell $14,000 in stock of regional Bell
companies while participating in department decisions affecting them.
   He said there is an ``adequate factual basis'' for finding in
four instances that Meese violated ethics standards.
   But Thornburgh said that in regard to the Bell stock, Meese
either didn't get adequate legal advice or didn't follow it.
Thornburgh characterized that as a mistake, saying ``I've done that
myself sometimes. People make mistakes. We're all human.''
   Thornburgh emphasized that the findings in the report were those
of OPR, not of the attorney general.
   Meese, according to the report, violated ethical standards which
require government employees to avoid the appearance of impropriety
when carrying out official duties.
   But Korten said such a requirement is ``a lousy standard.'' He
said appearance is a ``subjective matter. It is not an objective
measure. What appears improper to one person may look OK to
another.''
   ``He had a close personal relationship with Mr. Wallach,'' said
Korten. ``I don't see why you can begrudge somebody of those
friendships.''
   The report notes at least 600 contacts between Meese and Wallach
beginning in 1981. It says that Wallach, a San Francisco personal
injury lawyer, showered Meese with letters and memos on topics
ranging from a ``diet program'' for the stocky presidential
counselor to business arrangements, while meeting with Meese in some
cases twice a day.
   Many of the memos, coming in ``a virtual torrent'' while Meese
was counselor to the president, contain ``a strong undercurrent'' in
which Wallach was ``seeking action'' from Meese and his staff ``in
matters in which he had a financial interest,'' said the report.
   It said the letters and memos from Wallach either confirm a close
personal relationship or ``reveal a level of presumptuousness on the
part of Mr. Wallach which exceeded that which one would think
humanly possible.''
   Wallach suggested in one letter moving United Nations Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick to a new job, with Wallach becoming her
replacement. He also sent Meese a proprosed draft for Reagan's 1983
State of the Union address and suggested in another memo a way to
increase Meese's power. He recommended moving then-White House Chief
of Staff James A Baker III to the CIA and assigning then-CIA
Director William Casey to the National Security Council.
   In addition to the case in which the Army awarded a huge contract
to Wedtech, the report said, ``Meese and his staff injected
themselves ... as a direct result of the friendship between Wallach
and Meese'' into a financial problem Wedtech was having with the
Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration.
   Meese's intervention, including a phone call to then-Commerce
Secretary Malcolm Baldridge, was ``precisely'' the type of activity
prohibited by a federal executive order spelling out ethical
standards for federal employees, the report said.
   On the oil pipeline, Meese, again at Wallach's urging, arranged a
meeting in 1985 for Wallach and his client, Swiss oilman Bruce
Rappaport, with then-White House National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane in an attempt to help secure an insurance package that
would support the project, the report said.
   George Walker, a lawyer for Wallach, said Wallach simply asked
Meese to ensure that Wedtech was being treated fairly on the Wedtech
engine contract and that Meese ``didn't participate'' in resolving
the problem surrounding Wedtech and the commerce department. Walker
said Meese had little involvement in the pipeline project.
   Walker said in regard to the more than 600 contacts between
Wallach and Meese that ``Wallach put all this in writing. We know
there's nothing wrong,'' emphasizing, ``The report is old news.''

<HEAD>Thousands March To Protest Economic Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers and students marched
through the streets of the capital and other cities Tuesday
demanding wage increases and protesting government economic policies.
   The march in La Paz was preceded by a rally and was called by the
Bolivian Workers Central, which says road blocks and strikes will
follow.
   Similar marches took place in other cities in the interior, radio
stations reported.
   Planning Minister Fernando Romero said the government has
included a 15 percent wage increase in its new budget and cannot
offer more. ``One cannot wring water from rocks,'' he said in
response to Workers Central wage demands.
   Speakers at Tuesday's rally called the government wage program
``inhuman'' and said it spells starvation for many.
   Bolivia's minimum monthly wage is $40, but many food prices are
comparable to those in the United States.
   The conservative government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro
says keeping a lid on wages is essential to the success of its
economic program.
   The government has lowered inflation from 24,000 percent four
years ago to 21 percent by firing 23,000 miners, closing
unproductive mines, imposing strict wage controls and lifting all
price controls.
   Social unrest has been kept in check through an emergency wage
program financed by the World Bank and foreign governments. Tens of
thousands of workers have been employed building roads, schools,
irrigation systems and rural clinics.

<TEXT>
   About 150 poor people, their problems
multiplied by the national economic crisis, Tuesday looted a Red
Cross warehouse of food and clothing intended for victims of
Hurricane Joan, Red Cross officials said.
   Managua Red Cross Director Omar Cruz said the group broke into
the warehouse through the roof. He said he did not have an estimate
on the value of items taken.
   A police official said on condition of anonymity, ``There were no
arrests because we had limited forces there and it was impossible
for more people to climb up on the warehouse.''
   An AP photogapher who happened to pass the warehouse during the
looting reported seeing people carrying away armfuls of canned food
and clothing.
   Hurricane Joan slammed into the Atlantic coast on Oct. 21,
killing about 100 people and leaving an estimated 200,000 homeless.
Property damage was estimated at more than $700 million.
   Few in the capital were affected. But many of the thousands who
suffered property damages in Nicaragua's rural areas since have
moved to Managua.
   The Sandinista government says the hurricane worsened the
country's economic crisis. It also has blamed the crisis on eight
years of civil war with the U.S.-supported anti-Sandinista rebels,
known as the Contras.
   At the Mercado Oriental in the city's east section, it is common
to see dozens of people rummaging through trash cans for food.
   National inflation last year topped 20,000 percent, and the
government announced numerous devaluations of the official currency,
the cordoba, to keep the country's economy afloat.
   On Jan. 3, the government devalued the cordoba again, this time
by 120 percent. It raised gasoline prices by 125 percent and bus
fares 50-fold.
   The government also announced a spending reduction program that
would lay off thousands of public workers, cut defense spending by
27 percent and slash police services 40 percent.
   The government has not authorized salary increases although
prices on many basic goods have risen as much as 50 percent since
the latest devaluation.

<HEAD>Police Officers Indicted In Killing Of Three Dissidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civilian court has charged two national
police officers with murdering three family members in a 1986 raid
on the suburban home of a popular leftist folk singer.
   The Appeals Court of Southern Santiago indicted Lt. Sergio
Gajardo and Sgt. Jose Luna on homicide charges Monday in connection
with the midnight raid on June 30, 1986, Santiago newspapers
reported Tuesday. Police Lt. Col. Augusto Sobarzo was charged with
covering up the crime.
   Shot dead were the wife, sister-in-law and 16-year-old son of
Benedicto Salinas, whose songs attack the right-wing military
government of President Augusto Pinochet.
   Police first said the three committed suicide to avoid arrest.
They said they raided the house after being tipped off that it was a
clandestine medical clinic for a leftist urban guerrilla group, the
Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front.
   Human rights and dissident groups maintained the three were
gunned down.
   The Appeals Court ruling said information gathered by
investigators indicates ``the deaths of the three victims were
caused by third parties,'' the newspapers reported, and that Gajardo
and Luna ``appear to be the authors of the crime.''
   The ruling reversed a judge's decision not to pursue charges in
the case. The officers were expected to appeal.
   Human rights groups say killings in political raids by police
have occurred repeatedly during Pinochet's 15-year rule. Officers
have been indicted or tried in only a handful of cases and
convictions are extremely rare.

   A federal judge agreed Tuesday to determine
whether two Teamsters union officials must forfeit their positions
because they were convicted in an embezzlement scheme.
   Lawyers agreed to let Judge George W. White decide the issue, and
the judge set up a two-month timetable for attorneys to submit
motions. The two convicted Teamsters officials, Harold Friedman and
Anthony Hughes, can keep their jobs in the meantime. The two were
convicted Friday.
   In a separate Cleveland Teamsters case, five union members in
Local 436 have been indicted on federal racketeering, theft, and
embezzlement charges, related to the theft of $259,000 from the
local's welfare fund, federal officials said Tuesday.
   Federal prosecutor William Edwards announced the indictment of
Salvatore T. Busacca; his son, Salvatore I. Busacca; Pat Lanese;
Gary Tiboni; and Michael Paventi. No court date has been set.
   The indictments were returned by a special federal grand jury
Dec. 5 but were ordered sealed by U.S. Magistrate Jack Streepy until
after the trial of Friedman and Hughes.
   Friedman, 66, became Ohio's most powerful Teamsters union member
last summer after the death of Teamsters international President
Jackie Presser on July 9. Friedman's numerous union positions
include the international vice presidency and the presidency of the
Ohio Conference of Teamsters. His positions pay more than $500,000 a
year.
   Hughes, 52, holds three union positions that pay about $160,000
annually.
   Presser was indicted May 16, 1986, along with Friedman and
Hughes, but died before going to trial. The indictment listed the
union offices of Presser, Friedman and Hughes as being subject to
forfeiture after a conviction.
   Friedman declined to comment Tuesday after the verdict. Before
leaving the federal court building Tuesday, he shook hands with
Justice Department prosecutor Stephen Jigger and said: ``I know you
had a job to do, and I can appreciate that.''
   Hughes commented publicly for the first time Tuesday on the
verdict.
   ``They explained everything to me and I still don't understand
it. We will continue to fight,'' he said. ``I don't think we are
guilty, and I don't understand how they would come up with a verdict
like that.''
   Jigger told reporters he will try to have Friedman and Hughes
removed from their union positions.
   ``It was a six-year effort and we are pleased with the outcome,''
said Jigger, also commenting publicly for the first time. ``Judge
White gave everyone a full and fair trial, and justice was done. It
shows the system worked.''
   Friedman was convicted of embezzlement, labor racketeering,
conspiracy to commit labor racketeering and filing a false report to
the Department of Labor. He could be sentenced to as many as 46
years in prison and fined up to $70,000.
   Hughes was convicted of embezzlement, labor racketeering and
conspiracy to commit labor racketeering. He faces up to 45 years
imprisonment and a fine of up to $60,000.
   White has not set a sentencing date.
   The jury found Friedman and Hughes guilty of participating in a
payroll padding scheme. The indictment alleged the $700,000
embezzlement took place between 1972 and 1981.

percent of the 2,000-member teachers union voted to accept the
contract. No vote totals were disclosed.
   Teachers struck Jan. 4.
   If teachers had turned down the contract offer, Superintendent
Conrad C. Ott had said he would begin recruiting substitute teachers.
   The pact gives teachers raises of 2.75 percent retroactive to the
start of this school year, 3.25 percent in 1989-90 and 4 percent in
1990-91. It also includes improved medical and dental coverage.
   The 34,000 students in the district will make up missed class
time during spring break in April, and will attend school an
additional day in March and three days in June.

   ``Genesis: Music and Miracles,'' a retelling of
five medieval mystery plays, is not very musical and more mundane
than miraculous.
   This Old Testament song and dance, which opened Tuesday
off-Broadway at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater,
sounds like it was spawned in the late 1960s. The production has the
earnestness but not the conviction of street theater, the relentless
beat but not the soaring melodies of such pop musicals as
``Godspell'' and ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and the simplicity but
not the charm of story theater.
   Five episodes are told in a quick 95 minutes _ the creation and
the fall of Lucifer, the creation and fall of Adam and Eve, the
murder of Abel, Noah and the Flood and the story of Abraham and
Isaac.
   The results are painless and occasionally pleasant but nothing
more. The stories, adapted by A.J. Antoon and Robert Montgomery,
unfold in rhymes, many of them awkward and forced. The tales are so
well known that they need a little passion, humor and inventiveness
to make them fly. They don't get that here.
   The best moments come in the story of Noah, and these are
supplied by set designer John Conklin who has given the actors
boards and planks with which to construct a pretty spiffy ark. The
designer also supplies some toy animals, wooden figures that are
carried onto the boat by the actors.
   For a musical, the sparse score, which has music by Michael Ward
and lyrics by Antoon and Montgomery, is surprisingly wispy, sort of
like the lesser love themes from the Biblical movies of Cecil B. De
Mille.
   Still, the large cast remains undefeated by the material.
Particularly fine is Stephen Bogardus who plays the pivotal roles of
Adam, Noah and Abraham. Bogardus has a booming musical comedy voice
and is a fine actor. If Broadway had more than two or three musicals
a year, he always would find work. Mary Munger's Eve is sympathetic
and forthright, but she's also saddled with some of the worst lines
as Noah's shrewish wife.
   In one novel bit of interpretation, David Patrick Kelly plays
Cain almost like a psychotic street tough. His murder of the
passive, almost nondescript Abel is brutal, unnerving and hard to
watch.
   The red-haired Russ Thacker makes a persuasive Lucifer, a
grinning, boyish sprite with a ghoulish smile. Special mention also
should be made of young Braden Danner who sings in a clear, crisp
style and turns Abraham's son Isaac into a credible character and
not just the plot device he usually is.
   The choreography by Lynne Taylor-Corbett doesn't get past minimal
and is given mostly to two dancing doubles for Adam and Eve.
   Conklin also designed the costumes, and they include what may be
a first for the supposedly naked First Couple _ anatomically
correct, flesh-colored body stockings. A very strange cover-up.
   Except for those inventive glad rags, `Genesis: Music and
Miracles'' offers very little that is surprising or memorable once
the house lights have gone back up.

   Communist Party leaders adopted a
resolution on trade union pluralism early Wednesday after a 17-hour
debate, state radio reported, in a move that could open the way for
legalizing Solidarity.
   Earlier, the Central Committee was urged to offer legalization to
the banned independent union movement if it declares itself part of
socialism and refrains from opposing the government.
   But the proposal presented to the committee by Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski had so many conditions it appeared unlikely
the union federation, banned since 1982, would accept it.
   Rakowski said Solidarity also would have to observe a two-year
strike moratorium and give up financial aid from the West amounting
to millions of dollars.
   The meeting of the 230-member committee began at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
A commentator on state television said the debate proved ``long,
sharp and very hot.''
   State radio reported at 3 a.m. Wednesday (9 p.m. EST Tuesday)
that the session just ended and the committee adopted stances
concerning political and trade union pluralism. No immediate details
of the resolutions passed were available.
   The official PAP news agency said a package of proposals on
reforming the party passed unanimously, and the leadership's stand
on trade union and political pluralism was approved by a majority.
It did not elaborate.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other spokesmen for the union
movement declined official comment on Rakowski's proposal and were
not immediately available for their reaction on the committee's
decision.
   But a Solidarity source in Warsaw said on condition of anonymity
that Rakowski's offer at first glance appeared unclear and the
conditions he set ``unacceptable'' or even ``laughable.''
   He cited specifically the requirement that Solidarity declare
itself to be socialist and that it refrain from all strikes. He said
Solidarity must be able to function as a free trade union movement.
   Walesa had demanded the authorities agree to recognize the labor
movement before he talks with them on Poland's future. He warned
that social moods were becoming explosive because of rising prices
and shortages in stores.
   A strike demanding higher pay and legalization of Solidarity
meanwhile closed the 1,100-worker Pabianice Fabric Works in the
central city of Lodz. The strike was confirmed by the Solidarity
Information Service in Warsaw and by PAP.
   State news media noted that the deliberations were strained.
Party secretary Leszek Miller was quoted as saying a
``full-blooded'' verbal duel was going on between Rakowski and
official unions chief Alfred Miodowicz. Both men are on the ruling
Politburo.
   ``It was very hot,'' Miller told a TV interviewer.
   The discussion marked a key moment for the party and Solidarity
as communist leaders struggled to decide whether to risk repeating
the experiment of 1980 that permitted the East bloc's first legal,
independent union movement.
   Rakowski addressed specific questions to Solidarity. He said the
answers would determine if the union could be seen as a partner,
thereby ``opening the process of legalization,'' or as a ``political
opponent with whom one has to carry constant political struggle.''
   The questions included whether the union would ``see itself as an
integral part of socialism'' and whether it intends to act as a
trade union or as a political movement or party.
   He also asked what position Solidarity would have toward
anti-communist Polish groups and whether it would be a ``foreign
agent'' by continuing to accept money from the U.S. Congress and
other foreign organizations.
   ``I am putting all these problems in an unambiguous way because I
aim at avoiding any kind of ambiguity. The problems are too serious
to allow ambiguities,'' Rakowski said.
   He said the legalization process should be preceded by signing of
a detailed ``social accord'' among trade unions, political parties
and various clubs and associations.
   The agreement could include provisions detailing planned social
and economic reforms and establishing a ``civic body'' to settle
disputes among the signatories, he said.
   Rakowski said the economy would be the most important factor for
Poland in the coming years.
   ``It above all needs order and peace,'' he said. ``Even the best
administration methods and solutions will not meet our hopes if the
... economy becomes a field of political struggles.''
   After a 16-month period of freedom for millions of Solidarity
supporters, the union was suspended in a 1981 martial-law crackdown
and later banned.
   But the results have proved disappointing for Poland's leaders.
The economy has stagnated, foreign creditors have been
unsympathetic, and reforms have been hamstrung by the refusal of
many workers to participate as long as Solidarity is illegal.
   Zygmunt Czarzasty, a new party secretary, took the floor to begin
the second day of the debate and said he endorsed the Politburo
stand on union pluralism, backing allowing more than one legal union.
   Such pluralism is a ``social necessity,'' Czarzasty said.
   Bogdan Kolomyjski, the manager of the huge Katowice Steel Mill,
warned that competing unions threaten ``anarchy and divided work
crews.''
   Other speakers opposed allowing unions other than the
government-sponsored OPZZ alliance.
   The U.S. government has granted Solidarity $1 million a year for
the last two years, but Polish authorities have held up spending of
half of this.
   Total U.S. aid to Solidarity was estimated last year at $5
million by The New York Times.
   Solidarity does not deny getting foreign help. Walesa said he
would take money from the Kremlin if he could use it to defend trade
union freedoms.

<HEAD>Report Says Authorities Think Container With Bomb Loaded in Frankfurt</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout UPDATING with new report on bomb. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Tuesday they have
identified the baggage container in which a bomb was planted aboard
Pan Am Flight 103 and The Times of London said authorities believe
it was first loaded in Frankfurt.
   The jetliner blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, killing
all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.
   ``We have now identified the baggage container within the
aircraft in which the explosive device was placed, and substantial
forensic and reconstructive work is being undertaken in this
regard,'' Detective Chief Superintendent John Orr, the Scottish
detective heading the investigation, told a news conference.
   Orr refused to comment on whether the bomb was put on the plane
in Frankfurt or London or on who police suspect planted it.
   But early copies of Wednesday's edition of The Times available
Tuesday night reported: ``No details of the container, what else it
held, where it was discovered or where it originated were given
officially but police and accident investigators are now convinced
that it was in luggage first loaded at Frankfurt.''
   New York-bound Flight 103 originated in that West German city,
transferring passengers and baggage to another plane on arrival at
London's Heathrow airport.
   The Times said police think the bomb was no more than a few
pounds of Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosive.
   It said they think once a hole was blown in the side of the
Boeing 747 and the electronics bay, the plane's nerve center, was
destroyed, the air pressure at 31,000 feet ripped the aircraft apart.
   Investigators say the explosion occurred in the cargo area just
in front of the left-hand wing.
   Orr said about 10,000 items from the plane were recovered in
searches across Scotland.
   The Transport Department said on Dec. 28 that investigators found
evidence of a bomb in the framework of a metal luggage pallet, the
rack on which baggage is secured.
   Orr said Scottish police are working with police in the United
States and West Germany. He mentioned investigations in Scandinavia
but would not elaborate.
   ``This investigation is widening on an international scale and
over 3,000 witness statements have been collated,'' he said.
   He was asked about a report in Glasgow's Sunday Post newspaper
quoting former Israeli intelligence official Raphael Eitan as saying
he was sure the May 15 Palestinian group was responsible.
   ``There has been a lot of comment, some ill-informed, and I do
not think it would be helpful to identify any group,'' Orr said.
   Transport Minister Paul Channon has said the bomb probably
contained Semtex, a powerful and hard-to-detect plastic explosive
made in Czechoslovakia.
   Orr agreed the explosive was ``a plastic of a high-technology
type,'' but would not confirm it was Semtex.
   Special Agent Harold Hendershot of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and Helge Tepp of West German police also attended the
news conference.
   Hendershot said he was happy with the investigation's progress.
   Tepp noted that only the prosecutor heading the inquiry in
Frankfurt was authorized to give information on the progress of
inquiries there.
   In Helsinki, Finland, Yasser Arafat said Tuesday his Palestine
Liberation Organization is aiding the investigation. He did not
elaborate.
   Malcolm Rifkind, secretary for Scotland, said Tuesday the
government will meet all costs in Lockerbie, where 10 homes were
destroyed and 30 badly damaged in the crash.
   He said in a letter to local legislator Sir Hector Monro that the
cost of policing, emergency services and social work will be $12
million, besides $1.77 million already pledged for new homes and a
fund for those who lost relatives.

   A Colorado River tour boat smashed into a
sandbar Tuesday, tossing passengers from their seats and injuring 14
of the 44 on board, authorities said.
   None of the crew or passengers on the two-hour sightseeing tour
appeared to have life-threatening injuries, said San Bernardino
County sheriff's spokesman Jim Bryant. The tour started in Laughlin,
Nev., about 75 miles southeast of Las Vegas.
   The injured were taken to Needles Desert Community Hospital, said
sheriff's spokeswoman Nancy Wegner. Needles is about 20 miles south
of Laughlin, Nev.
   ``The Lord was watching over them, I'll tell you,'' Ms. Wegner
said, adding that when a boat hits a sandbar, ``It's like hitting a
wall.''
   The boat, about 50 feet long, is owned by Laughlin River Tours
Inc., said a company official who refused to give her name or
comment further.
   ``They got down there and were coming back. The water is low now.
The captain saw the sand and sped up the vessel to lift the boat
over the sandbar,'' Bryant said.
   ``But it didn't lift. It was going a pretty good speed. The
people on board in chairs got tossed around like ballast,'' Bryant
said.
   The accident occurred about 2 p.m.
   Sheriff's rescue boats and volunteers in boats took the injured
to the hospital, Ms. Wegner said. She said the captain and steward
on board were not seriously hurt and helped the injured passengers.
   The uninjured passengers were picked up by a sister ship and were
being taken to Lake Havasu City, Ariz., which is 35 miles south of
Needles.

   A judge formally indicted Oil Workers Union
chief Joaquin Hernandez Galicia on Tuesday on charges of homicide,
illegal weapons possession and resisting arrest, the Attorney
General's Office said.
   Hernandez Galicia is the main target of a government crackdown on
purported corruption in the powerful union.
   He was told of his indictment in closed session by a secretary to
Judge Jose Luis Garcia Vasco of the 8th District Penal Court, said
Rene Hernandez, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office.
   According to the office, Hernandez Galicia could face up to 40
years in prison if convicted.
   Hernandez Galicia, de facto leader of the union, was arrested
with others in a raid on his house on Jan. 10 in which a government
agent was killed.
   Under Mexican law, the judge has a year to hand down a sentence
or drop the case. Hernandez Galicia will remain in prison unless
bond is set, considered unlikely because of his political position.
   Nearly all of the 45 other oil union leaders, associates and
bodyguards arrested last week have either been indicted or released
on bond.

<HEAD>Federal Appeal Court Bars Religious Club Meetings At School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school cannot allow students to hold
regular religious meetings in a classroom shortly before the school
day starts, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
   The ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a case
from Renton, Wash., has implications for the Equal Access Act, a
1984 federal law that requires public secondary schools to allow
religious clubs to meet at school on the same basis as other
extracurricular clubs.
   The court stopped short of declaring the law unconstitutional,
saying instead that the Renton school system wasn't affected by the
law because it barred all non-curricular clubs from meeting on
campus. But the court also indicated that any on-campus religious
meetings would probably violate the constitutional requirement of
separation of church and state.
   ``The district must exclude organized religious speech because
use of public school facilities for religious purposes violates the
Establishment Clause'' of the Constitution, which forbids a state
establishment of religion, said Judge Jerome Farris in the 3-0
decision.
   If the ruling stands, the Equal Access Act ``has been
functionally rendered impotent and wouldn't apply in virtually any
public high school setting,'' said Steven McFarland, lawyer for a
group of high school students in the Seattle suburb. He said he
would appeal to the Supreme Court.
   Marc Slonim, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union of
Washington, said the ruling may be the first by any federal appeals
court on the issue but is consistent with a number of lower-court
decisions around the nation.
   ``Since early in the 19th century we've had a tradition of trying
to separate religion from public schools so public schools can serve
people of a wide variety of religious beliefs,'' Slonim said.
   He described the ``equal access'' approach as an attempt to avoid
the constitutional ban on preferential treatment of religion, but
said it inevitably ``sends a message of religious partisanship in
the schools.''
   McFarland said about 25 students applied in the fall of 1984 to
use a classroom at Lindbergh High School for before-school meetings
of a non-denominational Christian student group for religious and
moral discussions, Bible readings and prayer.
   The principal and school district denied the request, citing
constitutional standards as well as a district policy that allowed
classroom meetings only if the purposes were ``an extension of a
specific program or course offering.'' The students also were
rejected by U.S. District Judge Walter McGovern, whose ruling was
upheld Tuesday.
   ``Permitting this student religious group to meet in a public
high school just before the start of classes would impermissibly
advance rather than neutrally accommodate religion,'' Farris said in
the appeals court decision.
   He said the meetings would take place ``at a time closely
associated with a highly structured school day,'' creating an
appearance of school sponsorship.
   Although the Supreme Court in 1981 allowed a student religious
group equal access to a university's facilities, the same standards
do not apply to public high schools, Farris said.
   High school students are required to attend school and ``are less
mature and more impressionable than university students,'' Farris
said. ``Teachers at high schools, unlike college professors, are
both educators and authority figures.''
   He also said the meetings would improperly ``entangle'' the
government with religion, because teachers, required by district
policy to supervise all student activities on campus, might either
interfere with or advocate religious activities as the club's
supervisor.

<TEXT>
   The families of three Morton Thiokol
workers killed in an explosive fire at an MX missile motor assembly
building filed a $9 million negligence suit Tuesday against the
federal government.
   The lawsuit in U.S. District Court seeks $3 million each in
general and specific damages for the wives and children of Jeffrey
Ellis, 29, Richard Goodsell, 36, and Michael Smith, 24.
   The lawsuit, filed jointly by Lorene Ellis, Helen Goodsell and
DiAnna Smith, contends their husbands' deaths resulted from
government negligence in implementing and monitoring safety
standards at the MX facility.
   Specifically cited in the suit were the establishment and
maintenance of mandatory criteria, standards and methods for
procedures involving the manufacturing of the MX motors.
   The plaintiffs also claimed government negligence in holding
regular inspections of the premises to ensure that procedures were
being followed by Morton Thiokol, and that the government neglected
to warn employees or stop work in the event noncompliance was
discovered.
   The victims and two other Thiokol employees had been manually
removing the steel core from a casting of a first-stage missile
motor when 100,000 pounds of solid rocket propellent ignited in a
fireball Dec. 29, 1987, at the company's Wasatch Operations plant 25
miles west of Brigham City.
   Four of the men were killed instantly, and Ellis died 11 hours
later. The Air Force said in a report three months after the
accident that the fire was caused either by friction or static
electricity.
   The Air Force report concluded that Morton Thiokol had failed to
provide an adequate remote-control system or fully implement other
safety measures recommended after a ``near miss'' six months earlier
that consisted of a flash and release of fumes during the same
procedure.
   A telephone call to the U.S. attorney's office in Salt Lake City
after business hours Tuesday for comment on the suit was not
answered.
   Morton Thiokol was cited for six safety violations and fined
$31,700 by the Utah Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The
company vowed to appeal violations alleging serious and willful
deviations from division rules, but company spokesman Rocky Raab
said Tuesday he was not sure if the appeal was filed and the fine
reduced.

   George Bush is polishing his inaugural address,
trying to make it shorter, while the Senate opens the first
confirmation hearing for his Cabinet and the capital rehearses
ceremonies marking the change of power at the White House.
   Three days before Bush will be sworn in as the 41st president,
hotels are filling up with early arrivals from the 300,000 people
expected to watch or take part in the five-day extravaganza.
   ``The mood is very upbeat,'' said Ed Cassidy, a spokesman for the
inaugural committee. ``Rehearsals are taking place all over town.
Decorations are going up. Thousands of media people from all over
the world are picking up their credentials'' to cover the
inauguration.
   On Capitol Hill, James A. Baker III, picked by Bush to be his
secretary of state, was going before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee to testify about his nomination. Democrats hoped to pin
him down about Bush's policies on everything from the Soviet Union
to Central America.

   Stuttering, once thought to be
psychological, has been linked to brain abnormalities by scientists
who hope to understand many disorders by making 3-D videotapes of
the brain in action.
   Subtle irregularities in electrical activity and blood flow were
found in brains of 60 percent of stutterers, whose speech is broken
by abnormal pauses, repetitions (st-st-stuttering) or prolongations
(ssssstuttering) of sounds, said audiologist Terese Finitzo, who
directed the University of Texas studies.
   She said similar brain abnormalities were detected in 84 percent
of people with spasmodic dysphonia, in which malfunctioning vocal
cords produce a hoarse, strained, strangled-sounding voice.
   The Dallas scientists studied 20 stutterers and 77 people with
spasmodic dysphonia by examining magnetic resonance imaging pictures
of brain anatomy. Unlike CAT scans, which use X-rays, the technique
uses a giant magnet and radio waves to make pictures of organs.

   Doctors have long recognized the power of
female sex hormones to keep women's hearts healthy. Now there's
evidence that abundant levels of testosterone may be good for men's
hearts.
   ``It's attractive to think that being male is good for men and
being female is good for women,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor,
a physician at the University of California, San Diego.
   Estrogen, the female hormone, is believed to one of the key
differences between the sexes that explains why women typically live
seven to eight years longer than men.
   Barrett-Connor presented evidence Monday that men with high
levels of testosterone, the male hormone, are in better shape than
those with relatively low levels. Whether this means they are more
likely to escape heart attacks is still unclear.

   January usually means harsh winds, bone-chilling temperatures and
lots of snow, but not this year. From the Midwest to Maine, snowfall
has been below normal and temperatures have been above normal.
   ``Looking at the weather map and temperatures across the nation
... one would never realize that it is the middle of January,'' the
National Weather Service said in a statement Monday night after the
mercury had climbed into the 40s and 50s across much of the country.
Temperatures early today generally were in the 30s and 40s.
   The relatively mild season has been a boon to motorists, joggers

   A sudden Soviet willingness to consider making
good on bonds issued by Russia's czarist government is spurring
interest in the obscure securities, which long ranked as the
financial world's equivalent of a deed to the Brooklyn Bridge.
   Like the worthless deeds offered by hucksters to unwary
immigrants, the Russian bonds were considered for years to be worth
little more than the paper they were printed on, of interest only to
collectors.
   But on Monday, the State Department said U.S. and Soviet
officials have started talks on repayment of the Russian debt, which
was owed by the czarist government but repudiated after the Soviet
revolution of 1917.
   Similar talks with Britain produced an agreement two years ago
that brought a nearly $68 million windfall to investors there who
had hung onto or acquired Russian bonds, often for mere pennies
apiece.
   In 1919 the new Soviet regime defaulted on $193 million worth of
loans made by the United States during World War I, when the
imperial Russian government was among the allies fighting the
Germany of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Since then, unpaid interest has
brought the total to almost $900 million.

   An air historian says he has unearthed evidence
suggesting U.S. aviator Amelia Earhart ran out of fuel and crashed
about 30 miles short of a Pacific island on her round-the-world
flight a half-century ago.
   Roy Nesbit, a former British air force navigator, said Monday he
discovered a letter Earhart wrote to Britain's aviation authority
saying she intended to carry 1,000 gallons of fuel aboard her
Lockheed Electra on the flight over the Pacific, some of which
crossed over British Commonwealth territory.
   He said Earhart's navigator, Fred Noonan, also was reported by
The Daily Telegraph of Sydney, Australia, as saying the twin-engine
plane would be loaded with 950 gallons for the flight from Lae, New
Guinea, to Howland Island, a speck of land in the central Pacific.
   The record-setting pilot never arrived on Howland Island,
disappearing near the end of a 2,550-mile flight over water on July
2, 1937.

   Doctors believe they can predict in
babies 6 months of age which ones are likely to grow up to have high
cholesterol, showing that heart disease _ and its prevention _ begin
early in life, according to a report Tuesday.
   The findings, which emerge from a long-running study in
Louisiana, suggest that high cholesterol levels and high blood
pressure have begun to do damage by the time children are in their
teens.
   ``Adult heart disease very clearly begins in childhood,'' said
Dr. Gerald S. Berenson of Louisiana State University Medical Center
in New Orleans.
   Cholesterol causes fatty buildups in the heart's arteries. This
congestion can culminate in heart attacks, usually in middle age or
later, unless it is treated by changes in diet or taking
cholesterol-lowering drugs.

   In this corner ``USA Today: The Television
Show,'' fast on its feet, but dragging the baggage from its
inauspicious debut in September.
   In the other corner is the plodding ``Inside Edition,'' a
knockoff of Fox's ``A Current Affair'' that King World hopes will
knock ``USA Today'' out of the ring.
   The decisive round between the two syndicated shows is expected
during the February sweeps when local ratings are measured.
   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' barely survived the November
sweeps and has suffered station defections and time changes,
sometimes in favor of the new ``Inside Edition'' and the old ``A
Current Affair.''
   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' premiered last fall after
months of hype and a $40 million investment by the Gannett Co. in
partnership with Grant Tinker. The producers promised
state-of-the-art graphics and a format that would change the face of
television news. In retrospect, there was no way the show could live
up to expectations _ but it wasn't expected to be so bad, either.
   Overproduced and whizzing by at a frantic pace, its anchormen and
women were stranded on an unpopulated, space-age set, talking to
disembodied images on big-screen television monitors.
   The new version is much better. Brief updates on stories of the
day are delivered by grounded anchors who have been allowed to sit
down _ phew! _ behind a desk that does not spin, gyrate or sprout
statistics.
   Its light-hearted features benefit from the impressive graphics.
The flash and the likable, telegenic hosts remain. If this were the
show that had premiered in September, it still wouldn't have lived
up to the build-up, but reviews would not have been nearly so
negative.
   But those negative reviews did hit newsstands, and King World,
the successful syndicator of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show'' and ``Jeopardy!'' soon thereafter announced it was
gunning for ``USA Today: The Television Show'' with ``Inside
Edition,'' to premiere in January.
   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' had proven there was a market
for a syndicated newsmagazine. It had sold in 95 percent of the
country weeks before a single show was produced, thanks to the cast
behind the scenes _ former NBC Chairman Tinker, Gannett, and former
NBC ``Today'' show executive producer Steve Friedman.
   When the show fell flat, King World figured to step in and pick
up the market.
   But GTG stuck by the show, hired Jim Bellows as new executive
producer and announced a massive repromotion _ at a cost of $4
million _ to herald the re-created program.
   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' is far from the the sure thing
it once seemed. ``Inside Edition'' has been picked up as a midseason
replacement in markets covering 71 percent of the country.
   The Kings enlisted the producers of ``A Current Affair'' and
hired well-known TV personality David Frost as host.
   But ``Inside Edition'' wasn't exactly impressive in its premiere,
either. In comparison to ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' the set
looked like community-access cable. The content was a mish-mash of
previously covered sob stories. Frost concluded the show with an
embarrassing promise of ``no three-headed babies, no programs
devoted to issues like, should one-legged lesbians be allowed to
adopt ferrets, no sex surveys, and hopefully, no broken noses for
the host.''
   If ``Inside Edition'' is wavering, the new ``USA Today: The
Television Show'' has settled down.
   ``Welcome to the new look of `USA Today on TV,''' said co-host
Bill Macatee as the show re-premiered on Jan. 9. ``A new look for a
new year.''
   Several of the pieces were an amazing several minutes long _
documentary-length by the standards of the original version. They
were pleasant to look at if they were largely mindless. A
garden-variety feature on preparations for the inauguration included
a pointless film clip from the movie ``No Way Out.'' Another feature
delivered the news flash that car stereos louder than a speeding
locomotive are bad for drivers and other living things.
   But the show is at least watchable now. What remains to be seen
is whether the improvements are too late. Many stations moved ``USA
Today: The Television Show'' into low-rated late-night and gave
``Inside Edition'' the coveted time period just before prime time.
In the New York television market, ``Inside Edition'' premiered on
the NBC-owned station at 7:30 p.m. ``USA Today: The Television
Show'' has languished since September at 2 a.m. on the CBS station.
   Neither ``Inside Edition'' nor ``USA Today: The Television Show''
can claim to be great journalism. ``USA Today: The Television Show''
has at least tried to do something new.

<HEAD>A Different Perspective</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since economic thinking periodically succumbs to
conventions and fads, it is sometimes revealing and often wise to
take an oblique perspective, to look from the side rather than dead
on.
   If you do, you may see some pet notions assume a different
appearance, just as people in profile sometimes appear differently
than they do face to face.
   Consider the notion, sometimes expressed by the impatient, that
the trade deficit be cleaned up once and for all during the next
administration. Why piddle around; let's get it over with.
   But to do so would mean putting people out of work, lowering real
incomes and retarding economic growth. This would severely diminish
imports. In theory, it could be done _ but not without domestic and
probably worldwide recession.
   Forced recessions used to be part of economic policy, whether
stated or denied, and there are pure economists around who still
maintain that a good recession is a wholesome thing for the trade
defict. Sort of like a purgative.
   Today, however, economics is more heavily dosed with politics
than it was in the immediate post-World War II years. Recessions,
though they will happen, are less likely to be a consequence of
abrupt economic policy changes.
   Another issue deserving of a different perspective is that of
exporting jobs. It is a contentious one, often used by labor in
criticizing Washington's economic policy. By importing, it is said,
we're shipping jobs abroad.
   To which one economist, Professor William Dunkelberg, responds:
``Currently, we employ 62.5 percent of our over-16 population, the
highest proportion in history. If we're losing jobs to foreigners,
it's hard to figure where.''
   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's business school, suggests
that if the thesis had validity the evidence would show up as a
decline of manufacturing jobs. But it hasn't. Manufacturing
employment is strong again.
   True, he says, there's been a job loss in unionized, protected
automotive and steel industries where, he claims, wages were kept
artificially high. But jobs in some other manufacturing areas have
grown, along with productivity.
   How about foreign investment in the United States, an issue that
irritates and provokes millions of Americans? As they see it,
foreigners are buying up the United States. It's economic warfare,
they say, and Americans are losing.
   This one demands perspective, to wit:
   One reason net foreign investment has grown is that Americans,
themselves, are investing more in the United States and less abroad.
Again, Dunkelberg explains:
   ``The reason we are doing this is the same reason there is more
foreign investment here _ the United States is a very good place to
invest!''
   From a historical perspective, he adds, growth has been the
strongest in the United States during periods of strong foreign
investment. When foreigners seek a good thing, they sometimes do a
good thing: They make the country grow.
   Moreover, foreign investment leaves hostages. Plants and
buildings they erect in the United States cannot be taken home.
``When things sour a bit,'' says the professor, ``We can buy them
back at a lower price.''
   In the meantime, shouldn't some thought be given to foreign
investment in terms of jobs provided, wages earned, taxes paid, and
products put on the competitively priced marketplace?
   It's only a slightly different perspective from the conventional
one, but it suggests the possibilities in taking a second look at
what might at first seem to be one-faceted situations.

<HEAD>Solo Inaugural Prayer Is By Longtime Bush Buddy, Graham</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prayer for presidential integrity and courage by evangelist Billy
Graham this Friday brackets George Bush's inauguration. The ceremony
starts with an invocation of divine assistance and ends with a
benediction.
   ``I'm going to ask God to give the new president strength,
courage and wisdom,'' Graham says. ``I'm going to pray that he be
given the wisdom to know what's right, and the courage to do it.''
   Although inaugural ceremonies ordinarily include prayers by a
denominational cross-section of clergy, Bush this time chose for it
only the durable evangelist, a long-time friend and vacation
companion.
   ``I don't know why I'm the only one,'' Graham said when asked
about it. ``I guess he and Barbara must have felt I could represent
the others. I'm honored to have been selected.''
   Graham, who has been a confidant of presidents ever since Dwight
Eisenhower in the 1950's, is particularly close to Bush and his
family, and has been for about a quarter century.
   They regularly spend some time together each year at Bush's
vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, and Graham and his wife,
Ruth, also spent a holiday with the Bushes in Mexico before Bush
became vice president.
   ``I knew his father and used to play golf with him,'' Graham
related of the late Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut, whose
hospitality drew the Grahams into the Bush orbit in the early 1960's.
   ``We've been close friends of the Bushes for many years,''
related Graham, now 70, who in his half-century, globe-girdling
career has preached directly to more than 100 million people in more
than 65 countries.
   The new president, Graham said, ``has a huge family. There are a
lot of Bushes and Walkers (Bush's mother's maiden name). They're all
very religious people. I know all the children very well. They're
all religious.''
   After dinner at the Kennebunkport weekends, he related, ``we all
gather in the living room and sit around on the floor. I read some
Scipture and the children ask questions about the Bible.''
   Asked why Bush isn't as openly expressive of his faith as
outgoing President Reagan, Graham said, chuckling, ``Well, you see,
he's an Episcopalian.'' Graham himself is a Baptist.
   Of the long line of presidents which Graham has been associated,
he said, ``I think Lyndon Johnson went to church more than any of
them,'' although Jimmy Carter also was a regular church-goer and
taught an adult class.
   ``Ronald Reagan has talked a lot about God,'' Graham observed.
   Graham has scrupulously avoided taking sides in presidential
campaigns, whatever his personal associations, particularly after a
non-committal ceremonial appearance with Richard Nixon caused
accusation of partisanship.
   At last summers national political conventions, Graham led
prayers both at the Democratic and Republican affairs.
   However, while he has been a frequent White House guest and
counselor through a string of eight presidents, he has a special
niche in the Bush retinue because of their background.
   ``I think he'll make a far greater president than some people
give him credit for,'' Graham said. ``Bush probably has more
knowledge of what is going on in the world and more government
experience than any man that has ever occupied the White House.''
   Graham, who in recent years has condemned the nuclear arms
buildup, said the developing friendlier relations between the United
States and the Soviet Union ``is one of the great legacies'' being
passed on by Reagan.
   Graham added, ``I definitely think Bush will advance this new
warmth between our two countries.''
   In the inaugural prayer, Graham said he would quote George
Washington as saying that ``America stands on two great pillars _
faith and morality. Without these, our foundation crumbles.
   ``Sometimes, this seems to be happening, but there also are signs
that a new spiritual tide is running in this nation. I'm going to
thank God for America, and all it stands for.
   ``I'm also going to say that humantity's promotion comes neither
from the East or the West, but from God.''
   Graham said his inaugural prayer also would ask blessings on Dan
Quayle as Vice President, on his wife, Marilyn, and for the coninued
``health and service'' of Reagan and his wife, Nancy.

   When South Africa's black townships
erupt in violence, black policemen are in the front lines.
   When state-of-emergency regulations are enforced, black police
are among those imposing the will of white authorities.
   When anti-apartheid activists target ``government collaborators''
for attacks, black police often are singled out.
   More than half of South Africa's 70,000 policemen are black,
working for a government that upholds white privilege and living in
segregated ccommunities restless for change.
   ``Blacks are very important to the overall success of the South
African Police,'' said Dirk Kotze, a white police captain who trains
recruits at the black police college in Hammanskraal, outside
Pretoria.
   ``Black policemen are seen as part of the apartheid system,
enforcing discriminatory laws for their white masters,'' said Dr.
Nthato Motlana, a prominent physician and anti-apartheid activist in
Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.
   Black policemen generally view themselves as an apolitical group
providing an essential service in a country where crime is high. In
the black township of Soweto, home to 2.5 million people, more than
10 murders and 25 rapes are reported on an average weekend.
   ``I'm a professional policeman and my job is to uphold the law,''
said Lt. Col. Fanyana Zwane, a black who has worked in Soweto since
1969. ``We support the government of the day and don't get involved
in politics.''
   Yet black police are a vital link in the government's
intelligence network, helping to collect information on political
activists who may be detained without trial.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying periods
during the 31-month emergency and there have been repeated charges
of police torture of detainees.
   Black policemen also are a buffer to reduce the number of
confrontations between black citizens and white policemen.
   ``I don't think the government trusts black policemen, but it
finds them useful in diverting black anger away from white
authorities,'' said Motlana, the activist.
   During widespread unrest since 1984, militant activists attacked
black police more than any other group associated with the
government.
   The homes of more than 1,000 black policemen were damaged or
destroyed and dozens of black police were killed in 1986-87,
according to research organizations.
   One group of militants not only burned an officer's home, but
``so great is the hatred, that they came back the next day with
sledgehammers and ... broke down the building to its foundations,''
Louis le Grange, the former law and order minister, said in 1986.
   Black officers are accessible targets because they live in the
townships were most of the unrest occurs and are the most visible
government representatives.
   Sgt. John Shiburi, who lives and works in Soweto, said more than
200 youths surrounded and stoned his house in 1985. Shiburi held the
mob at bay by firing shots for 20 minutes until police arrived to
rescue him.
   Shiburi said he knew many of the youths and has spoken to them
subsequently.
   ``They said they wanted to kill me just because I was a
policeman, even though I hadn't done anything to them personally,''
Shiburi said.
   Several months later, black students threatened to kill Shiburi's
wife, a high school teacher. The couple moved to a different
neighborhood, but continued with their jobs.
   Most policemen receive no special protection, but in some
townships they live in barracks surrounded by barbed wire.
   Despite the occupational hazards, there is no shortage of black
volunteers for the police force.
   Blacks and people of mixed-race make up more than 25,000 of the
60,000-member South African Police, the national force, and
virtually all the 10,000 policemen employed by township councils are
black. These figures do not include the police in black homelands,
where the only white officers are a few top commanders.
   Most black policemen are from impoverished rural areas, attracted
by the prospect of stable employment at a salary far greater than
anything available in their hometowns.
   All policemen, regardless of race, earn a starting monthly salary
of about 800 rand ($340). By comparison, beginning mineworkers earn
less than 500 rand ($220) a month and are among the better-paid
black workers.
   Pay parity for policemen of all races was instituted five years
ago and other discriminatory measures also have been eliminated.
Until 10 years ago, a white policeman was always in charge when
working with a black colleague, even if the black held a higher
rank. Now rank alone determines command.
   As recently as three years ago, black traffic policemen in one
province could not issue tickets to white motorists. This also has
changed.
   Several blacks have risen to the rank of colonel. But whites
still dominate the officer corps, and blacks are likely to be
stationed in black areas.
   ``I know the people in the township won't like me,'' said Charles
Maluleke, 22, a trainee at the black police college. But, he added,
``This is the best-paying job I could find and I have a chance to
advance.''
   Fourteen hundred black recruits are trained every six months at
the college, while hundreds of applicants are turned away.
   Of five students interviewed, all said they would have preferred
other careers but opted for the police because of the pay.
   ``My parents and my four sisters are all depending on my wages,''
said Maluleke, explaining that he lacked the money to study to be a
teacher.
   Police recruits are required to have a high school education, but
Kotze says many trainees are unsophisticated and have to be trained
in some social amenities.
   Many new policemen, including those raised in tiny villages, are
sent directly to urban centers. Critics question whether they are
adequately prepared for the turbulence that awaits them.
   During the recent unrest, police also have hired thousands of
``instant police'' who received only six weeks training.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has conceded that these
recruits need better training. But Motlana said that for many blacks
the image of the entire police force is beyond repair.
   ``It is impossible for blacks to trust any policemen under the
apartheid system,'' said Motlana. ``Blacks are not part of the
decision-making process and they will never have faith in anyone who
enforces these unjust laws.''

<TEXT>
   Teresa, a 25-year-old professional, has put
off a decision on whether to marry her boyfriend because that would
mean moving in with his family.
   Her predicament is just one symptom of this country's severe
housing shortage: there simply is not enough space to permit young
married couples to have their own apartments.
   As a result, Teresa must decide whether she wants to continue
living with her own family, or get married and move in with that of
her prospective husband. Complicating the decision is the fact that
she doesn't get along with some members of his family.
   Many residences here have 10 occupants in a space more suitable
for three or four.
   In the Nuevo Vedado section, three families, all related, shared
the same two-story home, once the residence of a pre-revolutionary
oligarch. Since none of the families got along, they had their
respective dinners in shifts _ at 6, 8 and 10 p.m. Eventually, each
family found alternate housing, easing what had been a wrenching
experience for all concerned.
   The government claims that every Cuban has a place to live and,
indeed, the housing shortage is probably less acute here than in the
overwhelming majority of other Latin American countries, where
homelessness and sub-standard housing are often rampant.
   But because Cuba has a different social system, the housing
problems and the ways they are dealt with are not the same as they
are elsewhere in Latin America.
   Because young couples often have no privacy due to overcrowded
conditions at home, the government runs a string of ``posadas,'' or
inns, where they can spend a few hours alone in a modest room for a
nominal fee.
   Occasionally, signs saying ``2 for 1'' can be seen hanging from
apartment building balconies. That can mean that the couple there
wants a divorce and is willing to trade their apartment for two
smaller ones, one for each partner.
   In the meantime, until alternate arrangements can be found, such
couples often must live under the same roof.
   Rodolfo Davalos, legal director of the National Institute of
Housing, admits that this unhappy situation is a ``common''
occurrence in Cuba but he says usually in cases of marital
difficulties, the husband packs up and leaves. An alternate solution
is to construct a partition in the house, in effect, converting it
into a two-family dwelling.
   In 1986, President Fidel Castro said he was appalled at the
evidence of corruption and profiteering in housing.
   He discovered that state construction equipment, material and
manpower were being used illegally to renovate existing housing,
enabling the owners to sell it at big profits. The government struck
back by forbidding the sale of housing altogether.
   Thus, a Cuban family that wanted to move had no choice but to
trade houses with another family. Last month, new regulations were
instituted which permit the sale of housing once again but only if
state inspectors give their approval. Their main interest is to
guard against profit-making by home sellers.
   There are ways for young Cubans to escape from an untenable
housing situation. One is to volunteer for a ``microbrigade,''
groups of mostly young Cubans who take leave of their regular job to
work at a housing construction site.
   The workers continue to receive the salary from their normal job
and the state provides the equipment and the building materials. The
normal workday is 10 hours but it is not unusual, as part of the
spirit of self-sacrifice Castro tries to instill in his people, to
find these workers on the job 12 to 14 hours a day.
   For the typical 200 peso a month worker (about $160 at the
official rate), the long hours mean an income of less than a peso an
hour. But the payoff comes when, after two or more years, the
``microbrigadista'' is entitled to move into one of the apartments,
at mininal monthly payments, which he or she has helped construct
   Rafael, a taxi driver, worked on a microbrigade at the Alamar
apartment complex 12 years ago. After two years, he was allowed to
move into one of the apartments, paying just 21 pesos a month. The
apartment will be all his in four years.
   The Alamar complex has grown to about 30,000 units. Dania, one of
18 women on a 90-person brigade, has spent two years as a
construction worker there and the long hours obviously had taken
their toll. She looked drawn and tired and said she looked forward
to going back soon to her normal eight-hour a day job as a garment
worker.
   But she is luckier than her peers in some other communist
countries, such as Poland and the Soviet Union, where the wait for
an apartment sometimes exceeds 20 years.
   The Cuban government abolished the microbrigade system for a
time, then resurrected it two years ago in an effort to meet the
increasing demand not only for housing but for day care centers and
health clinics as well.
   In previous years, housing was allocated largely on the basis of
need but lately the government has been shifting its philosopy
somewhat, showing a preference for workers who demonstrate diligence.
   Thus, in the competition for new housing, a father of five who is
indolent may lose out to an exemplary worker with only two children
_ a form of material reward in a country which usually relies on
moral incentives to get people to work hard.
   The microbrigades distribute among themselves half of the
apartments they construct. The other half goes to the elderly or to
others who are unable to volunteer for such work.
   During a recent speech, Castro said the portion of houses
allocated to the microbrigades may be raised from 50 percent to 60
percent. Since most of his audience was made up of
``microbrigadistas,'' it was the biggest applause line of his
two-hour and 45-minute speech.

<HEAD>Near-Month Oil Futures Soar To Highest Level Since November 1987</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oil has spurted to a 14-month high in the futures
market in a gusher of speculation by traders that oil-producing
nations will succeed in controlling their perennial overproduction.
   The price jump will not spill over onto prices of consumer
products such as home heating oil and gasoline unless it lasts for a
considerable period of time, analysts say.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, jumped 40 cents on Monday to settle at
$18.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The last time the near-month contract settled higher was Nov. 20,
1987, amid hostilities in the Persian Gulf in the Iran-Iraq war. It
settled that day at $18.93.
   Although Persian Gulf troubles no longer are an issue, the price
of the near-month contract for West Texas Intermediate has soared 50
percent since an intraday low of $12.28 a barrel on Oct. 5.
   One reason for the increase is speculation that some kind of
production agreement may be reached at a meeting beginning Jan. 26
in London between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and non-OPEC countries, according to Gene Nowak, an
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Nevertheless, analysts said the latest surge seemed more the
result of emotion than news.
   ``The main thing we've got getting this market up is momentum.
I'd have to list that as the first cause,'' said Peter Beutel,
assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   ``There's no underlying structural reason. There's no shortage,''
said John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
   Prices began rising in October on expectations that OPEC members
would agree to cut production as a way of propping up prices. An
agreement was reached in late November and took effect Jan. 1.
   Analysts said OPEC's production has been 19 million barrels a day
or slightly more, above its self-imposed quota of 18.5 million
barrels but well below December's production.
   In a sign that many traders expect the surge in oil prices to be
short-lived, prices for delivery in later months were significantly
lower.
   The March contract for West Texas Intermediate rose 27 cents to
$17.95 a barrel; the April contract rose 21 cents to $17.37 a
barrel; and the May contract rose 14 cents to $16.98 a barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the February contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.94 cent
to 50.91 cents a gallon and the February contract for No. 2 heating
oil rose 0.21 cent to 53.16 cents a gallon.
   The intraday trading high _ the highest point reached during the
trading session _ was $18.93 for the February contract for WTI. That
topped the 1988 intraday high of $18.92 on April 18, which also
preceded a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations, Beutel said.

<HEAD>Heart Crusader Claims Victory As Five More Companies Renounce Tropical
Oils</HEAD>

   Five major food companies have joined four others
in working toward eliminating highly saturated palm and coconut oils
from their products, prompting a multimillionare health crusader to
declare victory.
   ``How much I have had to do with this is for the public to
decide,'' said Phil Sokolof, who spent $2 million on nationwide
newspaper ads to promote his cause. ``I know we speeded it up.''
   The Omaha businessman announced Monday that General Mills Inc.,
Ralston Purina Co., Borden Inc., Pillsbury Co. and Quaker Oats Co.
had agreed to switch to vegetable oils with less saturated fat.
   Earlier, Kellogg Co., Sunshine Biscuits, Pepperidge Farm and
Keebler said they would stop using the so-called tropical oils in
their food products.
   Saturated fats increase blood cholesterol levels, which are a
risk factor for heart attacks. Sokolof, 66, blames high cholesterol
for the near-fatal heart attack he suffered 22 years ago.
   None of the companies gave timetables for the reformulation of
their products, but many said removal of tropical oils was under way
before Sokolof launched his campaign.
   In the earlier announcements, some of the companies denied that
Sokolof had any influence on their decision. Kellogg even denounced
Sokolof as irresponsible for placing the full-page ads, which warned
of the ``poisoning of America'' through tropical oils.
   But the latest announcements, in the form of letters to Sokolof
over the past week, were cordial.
   ``The elimination of tropical fats from Pillsbury products is a
major priority,'' said a letter from that company, released by
Sokolof. ``Thank you for your efforts on behalf of the American
consumer.''
   Sokolof said two major food processors, General Foods and Nabisco
Brands, have not supported his cause completely.
   But, he added: ``With nine of the top 11 players in the field, I
guess the battle has been won. Millions of ounces of saturated fat
won't be clogging the arteries of the American public.''
   Nabisco Brands spokeswoman Caroline Fee said her company, a
division of RJR Nabsico Inc., is testing its existing products to
see whether tropical oils can be eliminated, and that 32 out of 35
products it has introduced in the past few years have been free of
these oils.
   ``We are not a holdout,'' she said. But ``it is not something you
can do that quickly without making sure the taste and quality is not
jeopardized.''
   Sokolof said some Nabisco products also contain lard, which also
contains saturated fat. Ms. Fee said the review of the company's
product formulations also was looking at whether lard could be
removed.
   General Foods, a division of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., told
Sokolof in a letter that it was eliminating tropical oils in all its
products except Cool Whip. The company said it believes it may not
be possible to reformulate the dessert topping to eliminate tropical
oils.
   Sokolof's initial advertising blitz singled out Kellogg's
Cracklin' Oat Bran, Sunshine's Hydrox cookies, Pepperidge Farm's

crackers, Procter &amp; Gamble's Crisco shortening, Carnation's
Coffeemate and Borden's Cremora for their tropical oil content.
   ``While most people think they are contributing to their better
health by avoiding foods that contain animal fats, many do not know
that the tropical oils are as bad or worse,'' he said. ``Palm oil
has 25 percent more saturated fat than lard. Coconut oil has 100
percent more.''
   Some of the food processors have argued that the tropical oils
impart a distinctive flavor and increase their products' shelf life.

<HEAD>Few Surprises in Retail Forecasts: More Slow Sales In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retailers from across the country, gathered for
their annual convention, have heard an unsurprising forecast from
industry watchers: Sales will remain sluggish in 1989.
   Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail Merchants
Association told storeowners Monday that consumers are optimistic
and confident about the economy, but retail sales will increase only
6 percent _ 2.75 percent after inflation.
   Americans have already put a lot of big purchases behind them,
and ``there's much less pent-up demand,'' she said.
   Ms. Wells and Lyle Gramley, chief economist with the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America, were upbeat about the economy
although they did not expect consumer spending to surge. Gramley
said he saw no signs of a recession this year.
   He did see some negatives ahead, including a slight worsening of
inflation that would help to nudge interest rates higher. But he
said he expected interest rates to peak by mid-year. If significant
steps are taken to cut the federal budget, rates could decline
before year's end, he said.
   The forecasters spoke at the NRMA's four-day convention here. The
delegates included retailers ranging from owners of small shops to
executives of the nation's largest storeowner, Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   The economic forecasting session traditionally is one of the
biggest of the meeting, drawing thousands of retailers away from the
aisles of exhibits set up by cash register manufacturers and credit
card companies.
   Another industry watcher, Stuart Robbins, an analyst with the
investment firm Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said
he expected ``more of the same kind of muddling along'' in the
economy this year, resulting in a mediocre retail environment.
   Robbins said, ``I don't feel good about 5 and 6 percent'' sales
increases, recalling that in past years, retailers enjoyed 9 percent
or 10 percent gains.
   Forecasts of consumer spending are critical for retailers,
because they must adjust their inventories and expenses in line with
how much Americans spend. Economists also watch consumer spending
because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product,
the broadest measure of economic health.
   In recent years, consumer spending has increased although retail
sales have risen only slightly. Americans have been channeling more
dollars into buying homes and cars and into necessities such as food
and medical care, leaving less money for discretionary items, which
include clothing and furniture.
   High installment debt has been blamed for some of the retail
sales slump, which is nearly 2 years old.
   But despite the forecasts of higher interest rates, Ms. Wells was
unconcerned about consumer debt. Although they may owe more money,
buying on credit is such a way of life that ``people are more
comfortable with debt,'' she said.
   Gramley and Ms. Wells both expected job growth to slow. That
would affect retailers because new workers have been a primary
source of sales increases in recent years.
   Durable goods, such as cars, furniture and large appliances,
would bear the brunt of consumer hesitance, while non-durables, such
as food, clothing and gasoline, should see pickups, Ms. Wells said.
   Robbins had a warning for the retailers: No matter what sales do,
operating expenses will climb.
   Storeowners have been paring costs in the past few years to
preserve their profits as sales declined. But Robbins said expenses
would spurt higher because as costs of labor, goods and real estate
accelerate.
   The forecasters also said there were many other variables that
may affect business during the year, such as the volatile price of
oil.

<HEAD>Swimsuit Issues Prove Big Mid-Winter Sellers for Sports Mags</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sport magazine's latest issue may have come as a
surprise to some faithful readers who were offered a pinup sports
calendar rather than ``luscious photos of beautiful women in
swimsuits'' a year ago.
   In a testament to the selling power of mid-winter swimsuit
issues, the February Sport has a dark-haired model appropriately
dressed for what the headline over the magazine title called its
``Hot Swimsuit Issue.''
   The magazine's executives note that new owners _ and a new editor
_ have taken over since the last policy pronouncement on swimsuits.
Petersen Publishing Co., based in Los Angeles, bought the magazine
last summer.
   And the new owners say they are giving the predominantly-male
sports magazine audience what it wants, as demonstrated by the huge
popularity of the swimsuit issues from its rivals, Sports
Illustrated and Inside Sports.
   Sport is reviving its swimsuit issue just weeks before Sports
Illustrated celebrates the 25th anniversary of its first swimsuit
edition with a blitz that will include a pay-cable program, a home
video and a desk calendar.
   Sports Illustrated designed its initial swimsuit issue as a
travel feature to brighten up the dark days between the football and
baseball seasons when many Northern cities are snowbound and sports
fans are blue.
   The swimsuit issues periodically have sparked protests that the
sections are sexist, exploit women and are unsuited to a sports
magazine. Some readers threaten subscription cancellations, although
publisher Donald Barr said he had fewer than 50 cancellations due to
last year's swimsuit issue.
   Sports Illustrated charges about 28 percent more for ad space and
75 percent more for a single copy of its swimsuit issue. It expects
to sell nearly 5.5 million copies of this year's special issue _
which hits the newstands Feb. 6 _ compared with the usual 3 million
for regular issues.
   Home Box Office Inc. plans to air a 47-minute video about
shooting the swimsuit issue Feb. 9. A slightly longer home video
will made available a few days later in video, retail and magazine
stores, and retailers have reportedly ordered about 350,000 copies,
which will be priced at $19.99.
   Next fall, a special 25th anniversary desk calendar will be
published for 1990 using photos taken for the 1989 swimsuit issue.
Tom Ettinger of Sports Illustrated Enterprises said he expects to
sell about 250,000 desk calendars at $12.95 each in addition to
500,000 of the usual wall calendars at $10.95 each.
   Inside Sports, owned by Century Publishing Co. in Evanston, Ill.,
has its ninth swimsuit issue on the newsstands, and hopes to sell
850,000 copies compared with a normal rate base of 500,000.
   The magazine's first swimsuit issue was a parody of Sports
Illustrated's version, showing pretty women in swimwear carrying
rolled-up copies of the competition's swimsuit issue.
   ``It was so well-received that we decided we would keep doing our
own every year,'' said marketer Jerry Croft.
   Sport magazine tried its first swimsuit issue in March 1986,
featuring swimsuit-clad women athletes from all fields, but sales
failed to improve.
   In his message to readers last year, then-editor Neil Cohen
wrote, ``We didn't feel comfortable with the pages, they didn't fit
our magazine.''
   ``So this month,'' Cohen wrote a year ago, ``instead of devoting
16 pages to luscious photos of beautiful women in swimsuits, we give
you a 16-page pinup sports calendar. There are no sexy pictures
there (just some remarkable sports photos), but you don't have to
hide it from your kid either.''
   Sport Publisher Lew Green is looking for a sales boost _ but
won't say how much _ in Sport's rate base of 850,000 copies.
   He makes no apology for the change in philosophy on swimsuit
issues.
   ``What we are showing here is appropriate for a young male
audience,'' he said. ``... It's part of what sports are all about.''

<HEAD>Are Budget Deficits That Bad?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you kept your books the way Uncle Sam keeps
his, you too might have a big budget deficit, be accused of
irresponsibility and urged by your friends to take immediate
corrective action.
   But you and Uncle Sam differ in your approach to accounting. It
might surprise many people, but the old sprendthrift uses
bookkeeping that is more severely restrictive and harder to live by
than yours.
   This is but one of the ways in which, some critics claim, the big
federal budget deficits may be overstated, at least with respect to
their immediate impact on the strength or weakness of the economy.
   It isn't at all an apology for the rich uncle's big debts or a
reason to continue them. In fact, an unusual spectrum of economists
from conservative to liberal agree that regular annual budget
deficits must be checked.
   But, says James Griffin, chief economist of the Aetna Investment
Management Group, ``unless we understand how the numbers are
derived, it is impossible to draw any reliable meaning from them.''
   The big difference between you and your uncle is that you keep a
capital budget, spreding payments for durable, big-ticket items such
as your home and automobile over many years. It's the cash flow-debt
service concept.
   Sam has no capital budget.
   It means that whatever the government buys, however long or short
its useful life might be, it becomes an immediate expense. It's
called cash-based accounting, and it flies in the face of standard
accounting practices.
   Griffin comments that while a cash-based system may have merit,
``it is simple to the point of being silly when applied to the
federal government's operations.''
   He estimates, for example, that if capital items were considered
in the federal budget, ``we would get better than halfway to a zero
balance.''
   For an entity that makes significant capital-type expenditures,
he explains, the important point to recognize is that a zero balance
on a cash system is a stringent budget indeed. ``Cash on the
barrelhead for everything!''
   Business doesn't operate that way. Homeowners don't attempt to do
so. If they did they might be confronted with numbers so horrifying
they would sell the house and car and rent the least expensive
apartment they could find.
   Sensibly, they reason that the house and car are good for a few
years at a minimum, and that they can space out their payments in
affordable units over that time.
   And that brings up another matter that conceivably lessens the
impact of Uncle Sam's deficits. It is inflation, and the declining
value of the dollars used to pay off debt.
   Just as inflation allows you to repay your mortgage in cheaper
dollars _ offset to some degree these days by variable interest
rates _ it also allows Uncle Sam to repay his debts with money that
isn't worth as much as it seems.
   Says Griffin:
   ``With $1.83 trillion of privately held outstanding federal debt
securities and a 4.2 percent inflation rate in fiscal 1988, the
decline in the real value of outstanding debt offset roughly half
the officially reported deficit.''
   There may be a danger _ most economists today might say a very
real one _ in playing down budget-deficit dangers, especially in
view of the tendency of Uncle Sam to seek excuses for spending
beyond his means.
   But at the other extreme, there may be pitfalls too in failing to
understand where those big numbers come from, especially by those
folks who tend to look at government budgets as similar to their own.

<HEAD>National Semiconductor Announces Plan to Lay Off 2,000, Reorganize</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY McGRATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp.'s
decision to lay off about 2,000 workers worldwide was based on slow
demand and dipping prices but will allow the company to recover its
financial health by summer, company officials and analysts said.
   The layoffs are part of a company reorganization announced Monday
in a move allowing National Semiconductor to focus on its primary
business _ advanced semiconductors.
   The company, which designs, manufactures and markets advanced
semiconductor products, currently employs about 39,000 people
worldwide.
   ``While we expect slow growth this calendar year, in line with
industry levels, our management remains optimistic about the
long-term outlook for our company,'' said Charles F. Sporck,
president and chief executive officer of National Semiconductor.
   ``We believe this action will allow us to focus on our core
business and to maintain the company's growth and long-term
health,'' said Sporck.
   National Semiconductor's action follows the layoff of nearly
2,500 employees by Advanced Micro Devices, 1,000 of them in the
United States. AMD blamed a soft market, while analysts said poor
management also contributed significantly to the company's financial
problems.
   A weakening demand for semiconductors and, by extension, personal
computers in the second half of 1988 affected most major Silicon
Valley manufacturers. But shrewd management practices helped most
companies _ from Hewlett-Packard Co. to Apple Computer _ avoid
layoffs.
   The U.S. semiconductor industry's monthly ratio of orders to
shipments slipped to its lowest point of the year in December,
according to figures released last Wednesday by the Semiconductor
Industry Association. The figure meant that for every $100 in
products shipped, there were $93 in new orders. The figure for new
orders reached a high of $1.18 in April, and has fallen every month
except one since then.
   Dataquest, a high-technology consulting firm, has predicted the
semiconductor industry will experience modest growth of about 10
percent for the rest of this year, down from 36 percent last year.
   National Semiconductor's layoffs will occur at all levels in
Asia, Europe and the United States, with about 50 percent of the
cuts being made domestically, said company spokeswoman Mary Coady.
   The company also will take a one-time restructuring charge in the
third quarter of its current fiscal year.
   Company officials couldn't immediately say what that charge will
be, although the information should be available within a few days,
Coady said.
   For the first half of fiscal 1989, National Semiconductor
reported a net loss of $55.7 million. In the latest quarter, the
company posted a net loss of $25 million on revenue of $705 million.
   Company officials said the layoffs will allow National
Semiconductor to achieve two goals: a corporate reorganization and
bringing costs and staffing into line with declining revenues in the
semiconductor industry.
   ``Companies aren't buying as many personal computers,'' said
Coady. ``Luckily we are a broad-based supplier.''
   The drop in revenues also was caused by an inventory adjustment
by distributors who bought very heavily in the summer and had built
up huge supplies, analysts said.
   Mel Phelps, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco,
predicted the company is ``getting healthy again'' and will break
even this quarter and begin to turn a profit by the end of fiscal
year 1990, if it can work through the ``price dropping issue.''
   ``They now have a fix on where they are going with sales and know
what the level of business will be and what work force will be
needed for that,'' Phelps said.
   The layoffs will likely be permanent unless there is a surprise
large upswing in the market, Phelps said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's ability to produce steel will
increase this year after declining for seven consecutive years,
according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
   The industry's raw steel production capability is expected to
reach 115.9 million tons this year, up from 112 million tons in
1988, the low point of the decade.
   The figure was projected from a December survey of all mills with
furnaces for melting, the institute said Monday.
   U.S. steelmakers had facilities capable of producing 160 million
tons of steel per year in 1977, the highest on record.
   The projected increase from 1988 to 1989 is mostly a result of
newer and more efficient equipment. Those capital investments have
paid off with increased yield of finished products per ton of raw
steel, the institute said.
   The average yield is now close to 85 percent, compared with 71.5
percent 10 years ago.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar was lower against most major foreign
currencies in moderate European trading today. Gold prices rose.
   Traders in Italy said they expected the dollar to fluctuate
within a tight range ahead of Wednesday's release of U.S. trade
figures for November. The figures are expected to show a slight
widening of the trade gap from October's $10.35 billion.
   They also suggested the market was determined to give U.S.
President-elect George Bush some breathing space in his first few
months in office.
   ``The market can hardly be displeased with the election of the
second straight conservative president, especially one who should be
less of a big spender than Reagan,'' said one trader with an Italian
commercial bank in Milan.
   Traders in Frankfurt said the dollar was also being held in check
by expectations that central banks will attempt a renewed assault on
the currency if it rises.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 127.70. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 127.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8474 West German marks, down from 1.8575; 1.5750
Swiss francs, down from 1.5835; 6.3010 French francs, down from
6.3285; 2.0828 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0965; 1,354.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,359.50; and 1.1965 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7695 today, more expensive
for buyers than 1.7615 Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402.40 a troy ounce, up
from $401.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $402.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $401.50, up from $401.35 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.78 to close at a bid $404.43.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.91 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $5.89.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained sharply against the Japanese yen
today, reflecting its sharp rise on overseas markets overnight, and
stock prices fell in Tokyo.
   The dollar opened at 127.93 yen and went as high as 128.15 yen in
early trading before easing back to 127.70 yen at the finish, up
1.05 yen from the close of 126.65 yen last Friday, when the dollar
gained 0.53 yen. The market was closed Monday for a national holiday.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama attributed the dollar's strength
to the difference in key interest rates between Japan and the United
States and to reported statements by West German finance authorities
that the dollar's current level is acceptable.
   He ruled out the possibility of the Bank of Japan intervening to
stem the dollar's rise, saying, ``The situation does not require
immediate countermeasures.''
   Traders noted that on Monday, the dollar closed in London at
128.05 yen and in New York at 128.10. One reason for the gains, they
said, was reduced chances of central bank intervention as Japan
observed a holiday and many U.S. traders were absent from the market
in observance of the Rev. Martin Luther King's birthday.
   ``There had been strong demand for buying the dollar, but
traders' fears over intervention prevented such a move,'' said a
dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Then when they were freed from such fears, they all
went out to buy the dollar.''
   But the traders added that the dollar was unlikely to continue
gaining while the market awaited U.S. trade reports due Wednesday in
Washington.
   Meanwhile, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues dipped 70.86 points, or 0.23 percent, closing
at 31,227.52.
   Dealers said the dollar's steep gain and anxiety over the
upcoming U.S. trade reports contributed to the decline as many
investors pulled back to the sidelines. Prices of export-oriented
issues fell, as did those of steel, railway and petroleum shares.
   ``It appeared the market was taking a break today as the market
anxiously awaits the U.S. trade reports,'' said a dealer at a major
Japanese brokerage. ``But the yen's sharp downslide against the
dollar gave a downward direction and most shares ended up lower.''
   But most dealers appeared to take today's decline as temporary.
   ``The market is still bullish despite today's slip,'' said
Ichitaro Watanabe of Nikko Securities Co. ``I think it still has
potential for further growth.''

<HEAD>Toyota Announces Record Production, Nissan's Falls Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, on
Tuesday reported record highs for production and sales in Japan last
year, while No. 2 automaker Nissan Motor Co. said overall production
fell slightly and exports dropped by more than 11 percent.
   Toyota said its 1988 production totaled a record 4.24 million
vehicles, up from the previous record of some 4 million in 1986.
   Overseas production, which rose 27 percent to 244,210 autos last
year, will increase 82 percent to 450,000 this year, due to
increased output in the United States, Canada, the Philippines and
Taiwan, it said.
   Toyota's 1988 exports were 1.82 million vehicles, up 2.5 percent,
including 1.23 million passenger cars, up 3.3 percent. But exports
are expected to fall 2 percent this year to 1.78 million. Toyota's
best year for exports was 1985, with 1.98 million vehicles.
   Exports to the United States this year are expected to stay at
their 1988 level of 859,000 because of last week's announcement that
Japanese automakers will continue to limit exports to the United
States in efforts to reduce trade friction.
   Toyota production in the United States totaled 74,072 vehicles in
1988 and is expected to be 170,000 to 200,000 cars this year.
   Toyota's domestic sales in 1988 hit a record high of 2.12 million
vehicles, giving it 31.5 percent of the domestic market, based on
vehicle registrations.
   Nissan had a 17.3 percent share while Mitsubishi Motors had 9.3
percent, Honda Motor Co. 9.1 percent and Mazda Motor Co. 6 percent,
registration statistics showed.
   Nissan reported total 1988 vehicle production of 2.71 million,
down 0.1 percent from 1987.
   Its domestic sales and overseas production grew, however, with
domestic sales rising 13.5 percent to 1.16 million. Overseas
production was 549,016, up 11.9 percent, and is expected to grow to
a record high of 632,000 in 1989, up 15 percent.
   Nissan production in the United States fell 6.5 percent to
206,000 autos in 1988, but is expected to grow 18.4 percent to
244,000 this year.
   But overall exports fell 11.2 percent to 1.04 million, while
exports to the United States plunged 36.5 percent to 348,000. Nissan
did not reveal a target for exports to the United States this year,
but said they were certain to rise with the introduction of several
new models to the American market this year.
   Overall exports are expected to grow by 3 percent this year,
reaching 1.08 million vehicles.
   Mazda produced 1.22 million cars, up 1.8 percent, the firm also
reported Tuesday. Mazda sold 408,000 cars in Japan, up 13 percent,
and exported 820,000, down 0.6 percent. This year, Mazda expects to
produce 1.22 million again, and increase domestic sales 10.3 percent
to 450,000 while exports are expected to drop a further 1.2 percent
to 810,000.
   Honda said last week it would sell more than 900,000 cars in
North America this year, including more than 800,000 in the United
States. It will produce 360,000 cars at its facilities in the United
States, down from 366,000 in 1988, but increase production in Canada
from 50,000 to 80,000.

<HEAD>R.J. Reynolds Charges AMA With Trying To Further Political Goals</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. claims that
an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association is an
attempt by AMA officials to further their political goal of banning
the company's new ``smokeless'' cigarette.
   ``We are appalled that such a widely respected publication as
JAMA would jeopardize its reputation by promoting distortions to
further the political goals of its parent organization,'' G. Robert
Di Marco, Reynolds Tobacco's senior vice president of research and
development, said in a registered letter Monday to JAMA.
   RJR charged that a political faction of the AMA has printed
information in the Jan. 6 issue about Premier, which heats rather
than burns tobacco. The company said the information is
scientifically incorrect.
   ``No scientific journal, no matter how widely read or well
regarded, can afford to dilute or distort scientific facts, much
less publish information that they ought to know is scientifically
incorrect,'' Di Marco said.
   A spokesman for AMA in Chicago could not be reached at home late
Monday night.
   A letter to the editor of JAMA reported preliminary results from
two government scientists at the National Institute of Drug Abuse in
Baltimore, which claims that Premier could be altered to smoke crack
cocaine.
   Di Marco said RJR scientists met with top AMA officials in June
and presented an overview of the scientific testing conducted on
Premier.
   ``Despite our initial invitations to visit our laboratories and
talk to our scientists, to date the AMA has not accepted our offer
to learn detailed facts about the science surrounding Premier, nor
did they contact us in regard to their most recent statements,'' Di
Marco said.
   ``This leads me to believe that the real issue here is
prohibition,'' he added.

<HEAD>Five Asian Airlines To Become Partners In Regional Computer Reservation
System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Asian airlines, China Airlines Ltd.,
Malaysia Airlines System Bhd and Philippine Airlines have signed up
as equity partners in a $100 million regional computer reservation
system, Abacus.
   Together with existing partners, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., they plan to develop and market the
system as well as negotiate for links with other similar systems
worldwide, they said in a press release Tuesday.
   The three new partners signed a letter of intent on Tuesday,
giving them a six-month period in which to work out the details of
equity distribution among the five parties.
   A spokesman from Abacus, currently a shell company financed by
loans from SIA and Cathay Pacific, said while nothing has been
finalized, each airline is not expected to own less than 10 percent
of the total equity.
   Abacus is also in the final stages of negotiation for a 10
percent acquisition in a computer reservation system owned by Trans
World Airlines and Northwest called PARS. It also plans to work out
a cooperative agreement with Amadeus, a similar system in Europe.
   When the three phases of the Abacus project are completed,
sometime in the third quarter of 1990, travel agents in Asia will
have direct access to bookings in partcipating airlines, hotels and
car rental services through a core computer to be located in
Singapore.

<HEAD>Housefly Habits In Famous Restaurant Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New 4th graf ``Today, prosecutors...'' to update with one charge
dropped.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dinner for two costs at least $250 at Le Gavroche,
so what is the master chef doing in court, being bugged about flies
messing up the food in London's most famous restaurant?
   The prosecution trotted out a 10-inch model of a fly to display
in magistrates' court on Monday, where chef Albert Roux was
contesting 15 charges of violating food and hygiene regulations and
five under health and safety legislation.
   The charges, for which the eatery could face fines, refer to food
contamination by flies and the premises being at risk of infestation
by rats and mice.
   Today, prosecutors dropped one charge filed under the food and
hygiene regulations, saying it had been determined there was no
problem with the location of the restaurant staff's bathroom.
   Le Gavroche, in London's chichi Mayfair area, is one of just two
restaurants in Britain to hold the coveted Michelin three-star
rating. The other, at Bray-on-Thames, west of London, is run by
Roux's brother, Michel.
   A health officer for Westminster city council has testified that
he saw flies in the restaurant kitchen, attracted by dirty, open
garbage bins outside, flying in through open windows and doors and
holes in the pantry's mesh screen.
   Dr. Nicholas Burgess, an entomologist and witness for the
prosecution, brought in the model of the fly.
   He testified that the insect has ``revolting'' eating habits and
can cause a list of diseases running to 45 pages. Burgess said these
include salmonella, dysentery and conjunctivitis and said flies
contaminate food while they eat, mate and lay eggs on it.
   There was laughter in court when Burgess added that in the Jewish
religion, ``one can kill flies on the Sabbath and a fly in one's
food is grounds for divorce.''
   But Burgess said in answering Roux's lawyer, Timothy Cassel: ``I
don't think any entomologist could find direct evidence of any
particular disease caused by a fly.''
   Cassel said council health officer Alexander Parker-Brown was
``obviously biased'' and ``eager to prosecute ... One cannot rely
too heavily on the objectivity, fairness and judgement of a man who
described a chipped (electric) plug as `serious.'''
   Cassel said Parker-Brown's predecessor had praised the Le
Gavroche kitchen and put it in the top category. The kitchen's
alleged deterioration coincided with the arrival of Parker-Brown, he
said.
   Le Gavroche, said the attorney, is a ``restaurant of which this
country can feel proud.''
   Cassel said it was inconceivable that in 18 months it could have
gone from being a shining example to squalor and a possible
candidate for closure, and then back to best again, ``all under the
same management.''
   Health officers have said they did not find Le Gavroche filthy
enough to close, but the bad publicity over the case has been a
major punishment in itself.

<HEAD>Delta Finds Faulty Wiring In Two More Planes, Seven 757s Affected</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with new findings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers found errors in emergency system
wiring of two Delta Air Lines Boeing 757s, an airline spokesman said
today. Similar problems have been reported in five other planes
belonging to four carriers.
   Jim Lundy, a Delta spokesman in Atlanta, said the airline
immediately notified the Federal Aviation Administration and
corrected the problems, which would have prevented sprinklers from
working properly in the event of a baggage hold fire.
   Similar problems were earlier reported in another Delta-operated
757, one belonging to Royal Brunei Airlines, two owned by Air
Holland and one operated by the British airline Air 2000. One of the
Air Holland planes was being used by a charter company in Canada.
   Discovery of the crossed-wiring by Delta engineers in one of its
41 new 757s led to an FAA ``airworthiness directive'' last Friday.
Airlines using the planes had until this morning to complete the
inspections.
   Officials of Eastern, which operates 25 of the 757s, and
Northwest, which has 33, said today they found no problems with any
of their planes.
   Lundy said all other Delta planes also passed the inspection.
   He said one plane had cross-wiring into the cargo area, which
would have resulted in the wrong sprinkler system going off. The
other had a wiring error that would have flashed a warning light in
the cockpit, but the fire extinguisher would not have worked, he
said.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the agency had not yet received
complete results of the testing of either the 757s or of testing
under an earlier order involving engine fire warnings systems of
Boeing 737s. In checks with several of the 10 airlines involved with
the 737 inspections during the weekend, none reported a problem.
   Regular airline service was not affected by any of the
inspections, officials said.
   The directive for 737s came as the result of speculation that
cross-wiring might have misled the pilot of a British Midland 737 to
shut down his good right engine after the left one caught fire.
Officials have yet to determine cause of the crash that killed 44
people Jan. 8.
   The two FAA directives were not related, except that both
involved possible cross-wiring.
   The 757 inspection was for cross-wiring of warning systems from
the cargo holds, done either on the Boeing assembly line in Seattle
where the planes were built less than a year ago or during
maintenance.
   ``We are looking into the technical aspects of it to see what the
miswiring was or is, how they relate to each other, and what might
have happened so we can correct it,'' Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said
Monday after problems with five aircraft had been reported.
   Cole said three of the first five planes affected were
manufactured at the same time, but the one owned Royal Brunei and
the first one from Delta were not.
   ``The Boeing Co. will examine what happened and study the way the
(fire extinguisher) bottles are put in there. We'll see if something
can be done to make them less fallible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kraft To Sell Food Distributor, Layoff Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Recasts lead to move up reference to layoffs.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft Inc. plans to cut about 250 workers
from its Chicago area operations over the next two months, and to
sell its small Kraft-Sage food operation to a management group,
company officials say.
   The layoffs, which will affect three Chicago facilities, are the
result of the company's recent merger with Philip Morris Cos. Inc.
and Kraft's ongoing productivity improvement program, the company
announced Monday.
   Kraft Inc. spokesman Gene Stevenson said employees will be laid
off from company headquarters in Chicago suburb of Glenview, its
manufacturing research and development unit in Northbrook and the
company's food-service operation in Deerfield.
   He said the layoffs will reduce the company's work force, some
2,800 in the area, by slightly less than 8 percent.
   The move had been expected since October, when Philip Morris took
over Kraft in a $12.9 billion deal, he said.
   ``Kraft just formalized it,'' said Roger Spencer, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc.
   ``You're seeing the kind of home office cuts you always see in
mergers; you only need so many accountants and tax guys,'' one Kraft
source told the Chicago Tribune. ``But operations aren't much
affected at all.''
   Kraft also announced Monday its intent to sell its Kraft-Sage
operation to the Stillman Acquisition Co. and the Greenberg
Acquisition Co.
   The management of Kraft-Sage, chief executive officer Sheldon
Stillman and president Gary Greenberg, formed the acquisition
companies so they could buy the company.
   Kraft-Sage, located in Des Plaines, Ill., is a specialty
distributor and marketer of foodservice products to the airline
industry.

   A Kentucky man who lost a leg in a farm
accident lost a Supreme Court bid today to revive his lawsuit
against a farm equipment manufacturer.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that the
lawsuit was dismissed improperly because a stenographer was tardy in
transcribing pretrial statements.
   The accident occurred Oct. 22, 1983, when Eugene McDowell was
unloading corn from a wagon into an old house used for grain
storage. His clothing was caught in the portable conveyor connecting
a tractor to the corn elevator, and his left leg had to be severed.
   U.S. District Judge Scott Reed in Lexington, Ky., threw out the
suit against Dynamics Corporation of America of Bloomington, Ill.,
the conveyor manufacturer.
   McDowell said the conveyor's design was defective and was
inherently dangerous.
   Dynamics Corporation said McDowell's own negligence _ his failure
to stand far enough away from the machine _ caused the accident. The
company also said the machine had been modified since its
manufacture and that Dynamics Corporation ws not responsible for the
changes.
   Reed threw out the suit on June 30, 1987 without reviewing
depositions _ or pretrial statements _ from witnesses for McDowell.
An engineer said in the deposition that the conveyor was defective
because it lacked a guard to prevent such accidents. The engineer
also said any changes in the machinery were minor and had little
bearing on the accident.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last June that it was
McDowell's responsibility to make sure that a transcript of the
statement was provided to the judge.
   ``Without the deposition testimony, (McDowell) has presented no
evidence of design defect,'' the appeals court said.
   McDowell's lawyers said the stenographer, called a court
reporter, violated federal court rules by failing to supply the
judge with the statement.
   The lawyers said, unbeknownst to them, the stenographer sent a
transcript of the deposition to attorneys for Dynamics Corporation
but not to Reed.
   McDowell was ``denied his day in court beacuse of the failure of
a court reporter to follow the federal rules,'' attorneys said.
   They also said that federal appeals courts elsewhere in the
nation have reinstated suits in such cases.
   The case is McDowell vs. Dynamics Corporation, 88-758.

<TEXT>
   Corn futures opened sharply lower but wheat prices
advanced and soybeans were mostly higher in early trading today on
the Chicago Board of Trade in the wake of the previous session's
sharp losses.
   Analysts said the wheat and soybean markets were turning higher
on indications that the Soviet Union would need to increase its
grain imports. Among those signals is the Soviets' own estimate that
domestic grain production will fall 40 million tons short of the
target of 235 million tons.
   ``The background stories that they might be coming in for a lot
more U.S. agricultural products have certainly supported the
market,'' said Arthur Parrish, a grain-market analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Corn, oat and soybean futures posted dramatic losses Monday in
response to an Agriculture Department report showing
higher-than-expected corn supplies.
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents to 4{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.33 a bushel; corn was 3 cents
to 8} cents lower with March at $2.69{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents

<HEAD>KN Energy Expects Profit Despite $40 Million Writedown Of Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   KN Energy Inc. plans take a writedown of
$40.1 million in the fourth quarter, but expects its 1988 earnings
to exceed its 1987 net income of $13.3 million.
   The company is marking down the value of its coal, oil and
natural gas resources to reflect current market prices, Charles W.
Battey, KN Energy's chairman and chief executive officer, said
Monday.
   Despite the $40.1 million writedown in the fourth quarter in
1988, gains from a lawsuit settlement and an asset sale should
enable KN's earnings for the year to surpass those of 1987, Battey
said.
   Financial results for 1988 will be announced next month.
   The bulk of the pretax writedown _ $33 million _ reflects a lower
valuation for KN's coal properties, according to Battey. The
valuation of oil and gas assets was reduced by $7.1 million.
   In early January, KN announced a $36.1 million gain from the
settlement of a lawsuit involving the ETSI Coal Slurry Pipeline
Venture. KN was a partner in the 1,000-mile proposed pipeline
project, which never got off the ground mainly because of railroads'
opposition. Settlements of lawsuits against those railroads have
brought millions of dollars to ETSI partners.
   And last June, KN sold its east Texas pipeline subsidiaries for a
pretax gain of $15.7 million.
   Battey said the company plans to increase production later this
year at its Golden Eagle underground coal mine west of Trinidad in
southern Colorado. The mine is operated by Wyoming Fuel Co., a KN
subsidiary.
   ``Our Wyoming Fuel Co. coal subsidiary has a good operating base
in its contract for coal sales to the Arizona Electric Power
Cooperative,'' Battey said. ``After the addition of efficient
long-wall mining equipment, which Wyoming Fuel will lease and have
in operation later this year, we expect to have positive cash flow
and operating income.''
   Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's raised KN's senior debt and
preferred stock rating by one level to A-minus from BBB. The New
York-based credit-rating agency said the improved rating was due to
the improved coal outlook, the use of pipeline litigation income to
reduce debt and to new markets.

<HEAD>American Airlines Said To Mull Aircraft Orders Worth $7.4 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines is expected to announce two
aircraft orders for 160 airplanes worth $7.4 billion, the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reported today.
   American spokesman Al Becker described the report as ``highly
speculative.''
   According to the article, the airline, owner of the largest
commercial jet fleet in the non-communist world, will order 60
long-range McDonnell Douglas MD-11s for an estimated $5.4 billion
and 100 domestic-range MD-80s for an estimated $2 billion more.
   American decided to buy the MD-11, which has yet to make its
first flight, instead of the Boeing 747-400, the newest, largest and
longest-range of Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.'s line of jumbo
jets, the newspaper quoted Wall Street and industry sources as
saying.
   The two deals will be announced within the next three weeks, as
soon as final language of the contract is worked out, the article
said.
   Asked to comment on the report, Becker said: ``We have not signed
any agreements nor have we made any deals with either of the
aircraft manufacturers and we have no announcements imminent.
   ``The article is highly speculative,'' he said when reached by
the Associated Press at American's headquarters in Fort Worth.
   Becker did note, however, that American has been evaluating both
the MD-11 and the Boeing 747-400 as part of its preparation for
expansion in the Pacific and European air markets.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said the deal would have to be
approved by the board of directors of AMR Corp., American's parent
company. The directors are scheduled to hold their monthly meeting
Wednesday.
   American has 465 jets in its fleet. Aeroflot, the Soviet Union's
carrier, has the world's largest fleet. American also has an
additional 213 planes either on order or option.
   McDonnell Douglas corporate offices in St. Louis, Mo., referred
Associated Press calls about the possible MD-11 and MD-80 purchases
to Don Hanson, the company's spokesman in Los Angeles. A secretary
in Hanson's office said he was not immediately available today.

   Stock prices closed lower Tuesday as players took
profits on the market's strong rally in recent weeks.
   Trading volume also was lower amid caution ahead of a string of
economic statistics due out later this week. Key among these is
Wednesday's U.S. trade report for November.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index finished 4.1
points, or 0.2 percent, lower at 1,867.7.
   Volume fell to 424.2 million shares from Monday's 497 million
shares.
   Since the start of the year, the London market has declined in
just three of its 11 trading sessions, and dealers said it was due
for some selling.
   Aside from the U.S. trade report, players also are awaiting news
on British employment and average earnings, due Thursday, and
British inflation figures, scheduled for release on Friday.
   While Monday's news of a slowing in British retail sales in
December was welcomed, the market is hoping the additional reports
will confirm that Britain's interest rate hikes are beginning to
ease inflationary pressures on the economy.

<HEAD>Former EEC Official: Trade Relations Good Despite U.S. `Rambo-style
Tactics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's
``Rambo-style diplomacy'' led to frequent trade clashes with
European countries but trans-Atlantic relations remain good,
according to Europe's former top trade official.
   Willy De Clercq, who recently finished four years as a key
official of the European Economic Community, also raised the
possibility that the latest trade dispute _ sparked by a European
ban on hormone-treated U.S. meat _ might be resolved shortly through
negotiations.
   ``I think there is a way to get out of it,'' he said in a recent
interview.
   De Clercq said he considered conflicts and divergent interests to
be normal between the United States and the 12-nation Common Market
trading bloc.
   ``What I have always deplored is the frequency which...increased
so visibly and intensively during the 1985 to 1989 period and the
way the American administration was behaving,'' he said.
   De Clercq complained that U.S. officials reacted to conflicts
with the Common Market by ``putting deadlines (and) threatening with
measures _ the famous Rambo-style diplomacy which we do not like
very much here in Brussels.''
   Even so, he said, ``the atmosphere has always been good'' between
the giant trading partners.
   ``Although there have been many, many problems, we have had
almost no real shooting war,'' De Clercq said.
   De Clercq for four years was the top trade and foreign affairs
official of the European Commission, the Common Market's executive
body. He now is a candidate of a conservative Belgian political
party for the European Parliament, the trading group's legislative
body.
   The latest trans-Atlantic trade spat was touched off by the EEC's
Jan. 1 prohibition on imports of American meat from cattle treated
with growth hormones. The United States retaliated by imposing, also
on Jan. 1, higher tariffs on a variety of European products.
   Common Market officials tentatively have agreed on
counter-measures that would slap stiff duties on American imports of
dried fruit and walnuts. Foreign ministers of the member nations are
to meet next Monday to consider formally backing those measures.
   De Clercq said the community and the United States agreed to
allow sanctioned products to enter their borders through the end of
January. This would apply to goods in transit before Jan. 1.
   He noted the delay probably will allow the EEC to start a new
dialogue on the issue with the incoming Bush administration.
   ``There has to be another round of negotiations,'' he said.
   But De Clercq said it was ``impossible'' for the Common Market to
lift the ban on hormone-treated meat, as demanded by U.S. officials.
   European officials cited health concerns in imposing the meat
ban, which originally was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988. The
trading bloc agreed to a one-year delay but refused further U.S.
appeals for a postponement.
   ``If you say it is to protect our population, then you have to
maintain it if it is so,'' he said. ``Expecting the (community) to
say now that it is going to allow the production or entry of meat
with hormones...is an illusion.''
   The prohibition is expected to halt the importation of about $100
million worth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States,
some of which are used in pates and sausages. Meat used to make pet
food is exempted.
   American officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten
cattle, a common practice among U.S. farmers, does not pose a health
risk.
   The meat imports represent a tiny fraction of the estimated $166
billion in trade last year between the United States and the Common
Market.
   De Clercq also said relations between the Common Market and Japan
had grown in recent years. He said European exports to Japan likely
soared by 20 percent to 25 percent last year from $15.4 billion in
1987.
   ``We have pushed the Japanese government...into opening the
markets more (and) integrating Japan more into the international and
economic circuit, behaving in other words like a great economic and
trading power should,'' he said.
   Common Market members are France, West Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.

<HEAD>Official Says Cheaper Dollar Could Backfire on U.S. Trade Strategy</HEAD>

   Pushing the dollar lower against the Japanese yen to
help shrink the U.S. trade deficit could have the opposite effect in
the long term as Japanese businesses become more competitive, a
senior Finance Ministry official said Tuesday.
   Makoto Utsumi, director general of the Finance Ministry's
International Finance Bureau, also said U.S. businesses were fully
competitive at current exchange rates even though they had problems
competing in foreign arenas.
   ``A further decline in the dollar would not reduce the Japanese
trade surplus,'' Utsumi told reporters at the Foreign Correspondents
Club of Japan.
   ``If the dollar weakens further, Japanese businesses would take
steps to survive by further rationalization of business and
manufacturing, keeping wage increases low, cutting labor further _
economy in every aspect,'' Utsumi said.
   ``After this process of rationalization, Japanese manufacturers
might be still more competitive,'' and paying lower prices in dollar
terms for imported raw materials would give them a further
advantage, he said.
   Japanese manufacturers responded to the first major appreciation
of the yen against the dollar in 1985-1986 by improving efficiency
after the major industrialized nations, including the United States,
Britain, West Germany, France and Japan, agreed to slash the
dollar's value to help shrink the U.S. trade deficit.
   In February 1987, those nations agreed on approximate exchange
rate ranges for the U.S. dollar and other major currencies, seeking
to restore stability to exchange markets, but the dollar continued
to slide from its September 1985 level of 240 yen.
   The dollar closed at 127.70 yen Tuesday in Tokyo. It has ranged
between 120 yen and 135 yen since November 1987.
   Economists remain divided over the actual impact of a cheaper
dollar on trade flows.
   Some say the cheaper dollar has helped narrow the trade gap by
dampening demand for more expensive foreign goods in the United
States and stimulating sales of cheaper American goods overseas.
They also say the dollar would have to drop to 80 yen or lower to
achieve desired reductions in the U.S. trade deficit.
   But Utsumi said further declines in the dollar's value would not
improve American export competitiveness.
   ``The problem is not price competitiveness of U.S. industries,
but the willingness and capacity to export,'' Utsumi said.
   Using exchange rates to boost exports has the disadvantage of
encouraging manufacturers to concentrate on fattening their profit
margins rather than improving productivity, Utsumi stated.
   The senior ministry official urged the incoming administration of
President-elect George Bush to cut the U.S. federal budget deficit
and curb consumer demand.
   ``Then U.S. manufacturers would become more eager to seek out
overseas markets to sell their products,'' he said.
   Utsumi said little remains to be done by Japan's government to
open its markets to foreign exporters. Instead, the question is
``how to crack the ice of the private sector,'' he said.
   He predicted Japan's current account surplus would decline by
several billion dollars in fiscal 1988, which ends March 31, and by
another several billion dollars in fiscal 1989.
   In 1987, Japan's surplus in the current account, which measures
trade in goods and services, flows of short-term interest and
dividends, repatriation of profits and other financial transfers,
was $86.7 billion, up from $85.8 billion in 1986.
   Its surplus with the United States hit a record $59.8 billion in
1987, up from $58.6 billion in 1986.
   In 1986, Japan's current account surplus amounted to 3.6 percent
of its gross national product, and was expected to amount to a
little over 2 percent this year, Utsumi said.

   The stock market sagged today in moderately
active trading, and traders said there was some apprehension about
economic reports due later in the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 12.32 points at
2,212.32 as of midafternoon in New York.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 8 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 505 up, 815 down and 567 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 102.52 million shares as of 2

   ``I think this is a temporary pause,'' said William LeFevre, a
market strategist at Advest Inc.
   Analysts said traders were focusing on such factors as the level
of the dollar and oil prices, Wednesday's report on the nation's
November trade deficit and Thursday's report on December consumer
prices.
   Also on traders' minds is the outlook for fourth-quarter earnings
at International Business Machines, due Wednesday. Profits are
expected to be up because of good minicomputer sales and gains from
an arbitration award from Fujitsu Ltd.
   Business inventories and business sales both rose 0.4 percent in
November after seasonal adjustments, the Commerce Department said
today.
   The dollar weakened slightly in trading today, giving up some of
its recent gains. Oil futures prices continued to rise above the
14-month high reached Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   On the trade front, some analysts are predicting a rise in the
trade deficit to about $11 billion in November from $10.4 billion
the previous month.
   Texas Eastern was up 1[ at 46[ on heavy volume. It is being

   The mid-flight disintegration of part of a
Boeing 737 over Hawaii is likely to lead to as many as 50 orders to
strengthen older passenger jets in the next year, a Boeing Co.
executive says.
   In the meantime, Ben Cosgrove, vice president for engineering at
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the world's largest commercial jet
manufacturer is making sure the Federal Aviation Administration is
told of problems in older planes.
   At a news briefing on aging aircraft, Cosgrove said that when
Boeing officials hear about an aircraft problem from an airline,
they tell the carrier to notify the FAA within 24 hours, ``and we
make sure that it does.''
   The Hawaii accident last April stunned the commercial aircraft
industry and raised questions about older aircraft and how long they
can safely fly. The Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 was flying over Hawaii
when an 18-foot section ripped from the top of the jetliner.
   A flight attendant was swept to her death and 64 of the 93 other
people aboard were hurt before the crew managed to land the plane on
Maui. The 19-year-old plane, with nearly 90,000 flights, was the
second most-heavily used plane in the worldwide 737 fleet.
   Last June, the FAA sponsored a three-day conference in
Washington, D.C., on older planes. One result was the creation of
task forces of FAA, manufacturer and airline representatives to
examine ways to ensure older planes' safety.
   Since the Aloha accident, the FAA has changed some of its
thinking about older aircraft, sometimes requiring operators to make
specific modifications rather than just checking for a given problem
and correcting it if trouble is found.
   Last fall, the FAA required operators of many older 737s to
replace thousands of rivets in some places where a 737's skin is
joined after the adhesive used on those lap joints was found prone
to delamination. In December, a similar order was issued for older
Boeing 727 tri-jets.
   Cosgrove, who serves on a working group that oversees task forces
dealing with Boeing planes, said it has reviewed service bulletins
Boeing has issued over the years as advisories for 727, 737 and 747
jumbo jets operators and has nearly completed recomending which ones
airlines now should be required to perform.
   The FAA will then determine which modifications should be made
mandatory through ``airworthiness directives,'' or orders to air
carriers, he said.
   ``You're going to see ads coming out pretty quick on some
recommendations,'' he said, adding later that as many as ``50, 51''
directives could be issued in the next 12 months.
   In addition to the Boeing planes, other work groups are examining
aircraft made by McDonnell-Douglas, Lockheed, Airbus Industrie,
Convair, Fokker and British Aircraft.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the number of directives
involving older Boeing airframes could be as few as 10 or 12, and
that the FAA may group some smaller modifications into single
directives to make the process simpler.
   Boeing officials and many others in the industry say commercial
planes can be flown indefinitely, as long as they are properly
maintained. What determines an airplane's life, they say, is the
increasing cost of maintenance, the aircraft's efficiency, and
technological changes.
   The National Transporation Safety Board report on causes of the
Aloha accident is expected out shortly, and Cosgrove said he would
wait until it is released before commenting on why that massive
structural failure occurred.

   The U.S. dollar fell in choppy European trading
Tuesday as activity ebbed in advance of Wednesday's release of U.S.
trade figures for November.
   Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said investors were selling dollars to take profits
before the trade figures are released. Economists expected the
November deficit to have widened to $11.1 billion from $10.35
billion in October.
   The market also believed the dollar was too high after its big
jump Monday, dealers said.
   But the U.S. currency began to recover in late trading after it
began to rally in New York.
   ``New York obviously still likes the buck,'' said a chief dealer
at a British bank, noting that U.S. players have been more bullish
than their European counterparts recently.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7680 to buy one pound, dearer than $1.7615 Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.8505 West German marks, down from 1.8575; 1.5755
Swiss francs, down from 1.5835; 6.3085 French francs, down from
6.3285; 2.0855 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0965; 1,354.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,359.50; and 1.1973 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1965.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 127.70 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 127.75 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $402.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $401.75 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $402.15, compared with $401.35
bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.78 to close at a bid $404.43.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.92 a troy ounce, compared with
Monday's $5.89.

<HEAD>L.F. Rothschild Quits As Primary Dealer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. Tuesday said it voluntarily
decided to quit as a primary dealer in U.S. government securities
and to discontinue most trading of the securities because the
activities have not been profitable enough.
   The company said in a statement ``the return on capital devoted
to its government securities operations was insufficient to warrant
continuation of the business.''
   Rothschild said it had ample capital to satisfy new guidelines
announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last November and
the decision was made purely on profitability grounds.
   The guidelines announced by the New York Fed Nov. 17 doubled the
minimum capital required for securities companies who have the
coveted title of primary dealer. The minimum was raised to more than
$50 million.
   Primary dealers can buy and sell U.S. government securities
directly from the New York Fed. Through the buying and selling of
the securities, the Federal Reserve System seeks to influence
interest rates.
   Therefore, financial firms with primary dealer status have an
insight into government interest rate policy. Also, primary
dealership is sought-after because some big institutional investors
prefer to conduct their business exclusively through primary dealers.
   The L.F. Rothschild move, which will result in the loss of about
50 employees' jobs, curtails all of the company's sales and trading
activities of U.S. government securities except for proprietary
trading, meaning for its own account. The company had been acting as
a primary dealer for about two years.
   From now on, Rothschild's operations will consist of fixed-income
securities sales and trading as a dealer in mortgage-backed
securites, as well as corporate and high-yield securities. It will
also continue to operate in the investment banking field.
   The withdrawal of L.F. Rothschild, a unit of Franklin Savings
Association based in Ottawa, Kansas, reduces the number of primary
dealers to 44.
   On Friday, County NatWest Government Securities Inc. announced
its departure from the exclusive group. County NatWest, a subsidiary
of Britain's largest bank, National Westminster Bank PLC, had been
under pressure from the New York Fed to boost its capital.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures posted a second day of
sharp losses Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly in a
continuing reaction to the government's report of
larger-than-expected corn supplies, analysts said.
   Wheat and oat futures closed mostly higher.
   Rumors that the Soviet Union may cancel some soybean or
soybean-meal purchases because of port congestion also contributed
to the decline in soybean futures prices, as did improved growing
conditions for the South American soybean crop, analysts said.
   Intra-day losses in the corn market approached the exchange's
15-cents-a-bushel limit, which was expanded from 10 cents a bushel
following limit declines on Monday. But a late rally brought corn
and soybean futures off their lows of the day.
   Monday's plunge was linked to Friday's Agriculture Department
crop report, which indicated supplies of U.S. corn and soybeans were
larger than most market experts had expected.
   ``The market is searching for support now following the
liquidation as a result of crop report,'' said Ted Mao, a
grain-market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 6\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.37 a bushel; corn was 2 cents
to 10\ cents lower with March at $2.68 a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 2{ cents higher with March at $2.33 a bushel; soybeans were {

<TEXT>
   Directors of Aussedat Rey, one of France's
largest paper companies, on Tuesday approved a $320 million
acquisition offer from International Paper Co.
   The friendly $107 a share offer for all of Aussedat Rey's stock
officially was submitted Monday for approval by French government
and stock market authorities, said International Paper, the world's
largest paper maker.
   The board of Aussedat Rey, which has about 3 million shares
outstanding, unanimously approved the buyout in a meeting at company
headquarters in Velizy, France.
   International Paper stated in a news release that it viewed the
buyout as an important step in its international strategy. The
company also stated it considered Aussedat Rey a good fit with its
own paper businesses, especially its growing reprographic copy paper
business and other activities such as laminated panel production.
   There are no plans to sell any Aussedat Rey operations,
International Paper stated, and the company intends to modernize and
expand Aussedat Rey's pulp and paper facility in Saillat, France.
   John Georges, International Paper's chairman and chief executive,
said his company was confident of Aussedat Rey's long-term growth
prospects and the acquisition would help strengthen IP's competitive
position in Europe.
   Aussedat Rey last year had estimated earnings of 120 million
francs, about $20 million, on sales of 4.48 billion francs, about
$710 million. The company specializes in printing and writing paper
production and holds a 10 percent share of the European reprographic
paper market.
   International Paper, the biggest maker of reprographic paper,
earned $754 million, or $6.57 per share, on sales of $9.5 billion
last year. Earnings for 1987 were $407 million, or $3.68 per share,
on sales of $7.8 billion.

   Sales for the quarter ended December 31 were $2.87 billion, up
from $2.68 billion a year earlier.
   The first-quarter profit fell in comparison with the 1988 quarter
because the company recorded a one-time gain of $50.2 million from
tax benefits related to the B-1B programin the earlier period. The
benefit came from deferring taxes on some income in previous years
of the B-1B program until last year, when the tax rate was lower.
   Rockwell delivered the last B-1B to the Air Force in April, and
the end of that program meant decreased sales in the aerospace
division, which also works on the space shuttle.
   Sales rose in the electronics, automotive and graphics divisions.

   The stock market sagged today in moderately
active trading, and traders said there was some apprehension about
economic reports due later in the week.
   Analysts said traders were focusing on such factors as the level
of the dollar and oil prices, Wednesday's report on the nation's
November trade deficit and Thursday's report on December consumer
prices.
   Also on traders' minds was the outlook for fourth-quarter
earnings at International Business Machines, due Wednesday. Profits
are expected to be up because of good minicomputer sales and gains
from an arbitration award from Fujitsu Ltd.
   The dollar weakened slightly today, giving up some of its recent
gains. Oil futures prices continued to rise above the 14-month high
reached Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``I think this is a temporary pause,'' said William LeFevre, a
market strategist at Advest Inc.

<HEAD>Shareholders, Creditors dismiss Offer For PSNH</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for shareholders and creditors of
Public Service Co. of New Hampshire on Tuesday dismissed a $2
billion offer for the company by Northeast Utilities as too low.
   Howard Berman, a lawyer representing PSNH's 100,000 shareholders,
said they would urge the company's board to reject Northeast
Utilities' plan ``as totally unsatisfactory.''
   ``The offer doesn't contain anything for shareholders, and we
believe it's inadequate,'' he said.
   Northeast Utilities offered last week to buy PSNH's assets aside
from its share of the Seabrook nuclear power plant for $1.2 billion.
PSNH's 36 percent stake in Seabrook would be spun off to the
company's unsecured creditors, while a Northeast Utilities
subsidiary would buy Seabrook power for $750 million.
   Northeast Utilities, New England's largest power company, also
would pay Public Service's unsecured creditors $300 million in cash,
stock and financial backing, bringing the total cost of the
transaction to $2 billion.
   PSNH was forced into reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws
last year because of rising debts from the $5.8 billion Seabrook
plant, which remains idle in the absence of a federal operating
permit.
   Berman said bidding for PSNH should begin at $2.8 billion and any
buyout plan must include Public Service's share of Seabrook.
   Joel Zweibel, who represents thousands of PSNH junk bond holders
and creditors with claims of about $1 billion, said the Northeast
Utilities offer ``casts too much of the contingent risk as to
whether Seabrook will operate on creditors.''
   The state, which has been negotiating with PSNH on a
reorganization plan for the utility, said Tuesday it was too early
to take a position on the offer from Connecticut-based Northeast
Utilities.
   Senior Assistant Attorney General Larry Smukler said, however,
the offer ``represents a reasonable basis for (further) discussion''
to resolve PSNH's reorganization.
   Smukler noted that the eletric rates Northeast Utilities is
proposing ``are higher than rates the state currently has on the
table.''
   The Northeast Utilities plan calls for annual rate increases of
4.5 percent this year and next followed by five years in which rates
would increase at approximately the inflation rate.
   The state's proposal calls for five consecutive 4 percent rate
increases, while Public Service is seeking a total rate increase of
30 percent to 40 percent.

   United Parcel Service on Tuesday announced the
acquisition of seven transport companies which will strengthen its
operations in Europe and the Pacific.
   The acquisitions, whose terms were not disclosed, also will
facilitate the privately held company's expansion into the Middle
East and Africa, it said.
   UPS said it was acquiring IML Air Services Group Ltd., a
British-based document and parcel delivery company with annual
revenue of about $37 million. IML owns seven subsidiaries worldwide
and its services extend to 37 countries.
   IML is to continue to operate as an independent company for the
time being, UPS said.
   In addition, UPS has acquired six other parcel delivery
companies. These companies previously were established by leading
freight forwarders to act as service partners to UPS. They now will
serve as the basis for UPS operations in several countries, UPS said.
   The companies are: Road Air Parcel Service SA, Belgium; Danish
Express Parcel Service, Denmark; Nielsen Express OY, Finland; T.T.A.
Express SA, France; Road Air Parcel Service BV, the Netherlands; and
Fracht Air Parcel Service Ltd., Switzerland.
   UPS said its international air network now serves 41 countries.

<HEAD>Kraft To Lay Off 250 In Post-Merger Slimdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft Inc. said it would cut 250 workers
from its Chicago-area operations over the next two months in a
streamlining move following Philip Morris Cos.' $12.9 billion buyout
of the processed-foods giant.
   The layoffs, which will reduce the company's 2,800-person work
force by slightly less than 8 percent, will affect Kraft operations
in three Chicago suburbs, the company said.
   Employees will be laid off from the company's headquarters in
Glenview, its manufacturing research-and-development unit in
Northbrook and its food-service operation in Deerfield, spokesman
Gene Stevenson said Monday.
   He said the layoffs would be across the board, affecting both
executive and blue-collar employees.
   The move had been expected since October, when Kraft agreed to be
acquired by Philip Morris.
   Roger Spencer, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said the layoffs
also were part of Kraft's own productivity improvement program.
   Analysts said the cuts indicated that Kraft Chairman John M.
Richman controls the merged food operations of Kraft and Philip
Morris, which also owns General Foods and Oscar Mayer Foods Corp.
   ``All these moves are Kraft-instigated moves,'' said Ronald B.
Morrow of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``They indicate that
Richman didn't waste any time taking control.''
   Kraft also announced Monday that it will sell its Kraft-Sage
operation to the Stillman Acquisition Co. and the Greenberg
Acquisition Co.

   Audi of America Inc. on Tuesday recalled about
35,000 1984-88 5000 Turbo and a small number of 1989 Turbo cars
because of a fuel injection system problem that could cause an
engine fire.
   Audi spokesman Joseph Bennett said the company was aware of about
a dozen such fires, resulting in no injuries or accidents.
   The company said in a statement that high temperature and alcohol
in some fuels may harden injector seals, allowing fuel to escape
into the engine compartment and causing a fire.
   Audi will notify owners of affected vehicles during the next
week. Replacement parts will be available beginning early next month
and repairs will be performed free of charge, the statement said.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar slipped Tuesday in quiet trading,
reflecting money-dealer reluctance to take risky positions in the
currency prior to the release of the potentially market-moving
monthly trade deficit report.
   Gold prices rose slightly after declining in the previous trading
session. In New York, Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$402.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $401.80 at the same
time Monday.
   Currency strategists said the dollar's decline signaled a
cautious approach by dollar holders toward the Commerce Department's
Wednesday release of the November U.S. merchandise trade deficit
statistics.
   The consensus is for a shortfall of about $11 billion, compared
with $10.35 billion the month before, but the numbers are renowned
for defying predictions.
   A number sharply higher than $11 billion could possibly incite a
big selloff in dollars, while a much smaller number could encourage
a surge in demand for the currency.
   In either case, the uncertainty of whether central banks would
intervene to stabilize the dollar's value with massive purchases or
sales of their own also encouraged caution in the market, currency
traders said.
   ``It was a very quiet day, with people squaring their positions
ahead of the release of the number,'' said Fred Scala, senior
foreign exchange dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New
York.
   Over the past few years the trade deficit numbers have become a
powerful influence over the foreign-exchange market, because of
their role in U.S. economic policy as well as their unpredictability
from month to month.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to 127.70 yen. Later in London
it was quoted at 127.75 yen. By the time trading ended in New York
the dollar was quoted at 127.83 yen, down from 128.10 yen late
Monday.
   In London the British pound strengthened to $1.7680 vs. $1.7615
Monday. In New York the pound fetched $1.7707, more expensive than
its $1.7610 exchange value late Monday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with rates late
Monday: 1.8495 West German marks, down from 1.8565; 1.5746 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5845; 1.1982 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1979;
6.3065 French francs, down from 6.3245; and 1,355.375 Italian lire,
down from 1,359.50.
   Other late-dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday: 1.8505 marks, down from 1.8575; 1.5755 Swiss francs, down
from 1.5835; 6.3085 French francs, down from 6.3285; 2.0855 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0965; 1,354.00 Italian lire, down from
1,359.50; and 1.1973 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1965.
   In precious metals trading, gold for current delivery rose 50
cents a troy ounce to $402.70 on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Earlier in London, gold rose 50 cents an ounce to $402.25; in Zurich
it rose 80 cents to $402.15; and in Hong Kong it rose $1.78 to
$404.43.
   Silver for current delivery rose 5.4 cents a troy ounce to $5.944
on the New York Comex. In London silver rose 3 cents an ounce to
$5.92.

<HEAD>Citicorp, J.P. Morgan, Security Pacific, Wells Fargo Report Higher
Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, and three
other big banking concerns reported sharply higher earnings Tuesday
for both the fourth-quarter of 1988 and the whole year.
   Most of the banks, which included J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., Security
Pacific Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., said they were helped partly by
tighter cost controls and Brazil's resumption of interest payments
on foreign loans.
   The earnings of all four banks were severely hurt in 1987 _ the
peak of the Third World debt crisis _ when Brazil halted interest
payments on bank loans and other economically troubled countries
negotiated to restructure their debt. Citicorp said earnings for the
three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $747 million, or $2.19 a share,
compared with $621 million, or $1.82 a share, in the comparable 1987
quarter.
   For the year, Citicorp's earnings totaled $1.85 billion, or $5.36
a share. That compared with a loss of $1.18 billion in 1987, when
the company decided to increase its provision to cover possible
losses from shaky Third World debt.
   J.P. Morgan, the nation's fourth largest banking company, earned
$258.1 million in the fourth quarter, or $1.38 a share, compared
with the $224.1 million, or $1.21 a share, earned in 1987 fourth
quarter.
   The company's 1988 earnings totaled $1.00 billion, or $5.38 a
share, compared with $83.3 million, or 39 cents a share, in the
previous year.
   Security Pacific, ranked sixth, said quarterly earnings totaled
$169.5 million, or $1.46 a share, vs. a loss of $39.4 million the
previous year.
   Its annual earnings reached $638.9 million, or $5.59 a share, vs.
$15.7 million, or a penny a share, in 1987.
   Wells Fargo, ranked 10th, said fourth quarter earnings were $136
million, or $2.45 a share, up 22 percent from $111.2 million, or
$1.96 a share, in 1987.
   For the year, Wells Fargo's earnings totaled $512.5 million, or
$9.20, vs. $50.8 million, or 52 cents, in 1987.
   Citicorp said all sectors of the company did well partly due to
tighter expense controls.
   The company said quarterly and annual earnings included, among
other things, $436 million from nearly two years of accumulated
Brazilian interest payments and $160 million from tax benefits
stemming from its $3 billion addition in loan-loss reserves in May
1987.
   J.P. Morgan said it received $240 million of past-due interest
from Brazil during the final quarter of 1988. On top of that, its
loan-loss provision shrank, to $200 million for all of 1988 from
$960 million in 1987.
   Security Pacific said the recognition of Brazilian interest
payments accounted for $58 million of the increase in net interest
income. It said results also reflected slow growth in non-interest
expenses.
   Security Pacific said losses on loans to developing companies
totaled $663.6 million in 1988 as a result of loan sales and other
measures that reduced its debt exposure.
   At year's end, the company had reduced non-trade related
developing country debt to $520 million, down from $950 million as
of Sept. 30, 1988, and $1.8 billion at the end of 1987.
   Wells Fargo said the provision for its loan losses in the fourth
quarter was $75 million, down from $114 million a year ago. The
full-year provision was $300 million, compared with $892 million in
1987.

   Stock prices fell for a second day Tuesday as
nervousness over trade deficit figures due Wednesday contributed to
the market's first back-to-back declines of 1989.
   After edging down 1.43 points on Monday, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrial stocks fell an even 10.00 points to 2,214.64.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
624 up, 800 down and 545 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 143.93 million
shares, up from 117.38 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 172.29 million shares.
   Traders worried that the Commerce Department would give the
market an unpleasant surprise with its report on the merchandise
trade deficit for November, said Rodd Anderson, vice president of
equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Expectations for the gap ranged around $11 billion to $11.5
billion, up from $10.4 billion in October.
   Also weighing on the stock market was a retrenchment in the
dollar, which has run up sharply in recent weeks, and another rise
in oil futures prices, which are at 14-month highs.
   Some analysts said the market seemed healthy in spite of the
successive setbacks.
   ``When the market is concerned, any bad news will kill it. Lately
the market has shaken off bad news,'' said William LeFevre, market
strategist at Advest Inc.
   Analysts said the market could be influenced by the
fourth-quarter earnings report at International Business Machines,
due Wednesday. Profits are expected to be up because of good
minicomputer sales and gains from an arbitration award from Fujitsu
Ltd.
   Apple Computer plunged 3] to 40] on volume of nearly 6.8 million
shares, making it the most actively traded issue on the
over-the-counter market or any market. Apple said its earnings rose
16 percent in the quarter, in line with expectations, but also said
it was cutting prices of some Macintosh computers and components.
   Intel, another over-the-counter issue, fell } to 23\ after
announcing a 10.4 percent decline in quarterly earnings.
   Much of the market's action was related to takeovers or other
special situations.
   Texas Eastern rose 1] to 46] on heavy volume after soaring 14} on
Monday. It is being sought by Coastal for 42 a share, or $2.49
billion.
   Marriott rose [ at 33~ on rumors, discounted by some analysts,
that it might be the subject of a takeover offer.
   Among other actively traded NYSE issues, RJR Nabisco rose { at
95\, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose [ to 29[, and IBM fell ] to
123~.
   Among airline stocks, UAL rose 1\ to 113~ on speculation of a
takeover attempt by Saul Steinberg, who has acquired a 5 percent
stake. NWA rose 2} at 59 on rumors that UAL might try to buy it as a
defense against a bid by Steinberg.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell relatively
more sharply than other market measures, mainly because one of its
components, Goodyear, fell 2[ to 51. The company said it expects to
report fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations that are
down 53 percent from a year earlier.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $5.20 billion, or 0.19
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.30 to 159.48.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.91 to 327.98, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index fell 0.59 to 283.55.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
1.31 to 386.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 316.57, down 0.24.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Plunge Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices plunged Tuesday for the second straight day
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of export cancellations in
a market already weakened by the government's report of
larger-than-expected supplies.
   Soybean futures also fell sharply while wheat and oat futures
finished mostly higher.
   On other other markets, gasoline futures led energy futures
higher; precious metals advanced; livestock and meat futures were
mostly higher; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.36} a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 10{ cents
lower with March at $2.67} a bushel; oats were unchanged to 2{ cents
higher with March at $2.33 a bushel; and soybeans were 14{ cents
lower to 1 cent higher with March at $7.70} a bushel.
   Rumors that port congestion may force the Soviet Union to cancel
some of its purchases of U.S. corn, soybeans or soybean meal weighed
on the futures markets for those commodities, analysts said.
   Under a long-term grain agreement with the United States, the
Soviet Union has so far agreed to purchase more than 10 million tons
of U.S. corn, 1.1 million tons of soybean meal, 450,000 tons of U.S.
soybeans and 370,000 tons of U.S. wheat for 1988-89 delivery.
   The cancellation rumors had the greatest impact in the corn pit,
where intra-day losses approached the 15-cents-a-bushel limit. The
Board of Trade expanded the daily trading limit for corn from 10
cents a bushel following limit declines on Monday.
   Analysts said the rumors surfaced just as the corn and soybean
markets appeared to be recovering from Monday's collapse, which was
linked to an Agriculture Department crop report released Friday that
indicated that supplies of U.S. corn and soybeans were larger than
most market experts had expected.
   ``When people started talking about net cancellations of U.S.
sales by the Russians, that brought in a pretty bearish attitude
right up until the close,'' said Steven Freed, a grain market
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Additional selling of soybean futures was prompted by reports of
improved growing conditions in Brazil and Argentina, where a spate
of hot, dry weather got the South American soybean crop off to a bad
start, analysts said.
   A late rally brought corn and soybean futures off their lows of
the day. But corn for near-month delivery still closed at its lowest
point since Dec. 20 and January soybeans finished at $7.61}, the
lowest soybean futures price since Dec. 5.
   ``The market is searching for support now following the
liquidation as a result of the crop report,'' said Ted Mao, a
grain-market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Freed predicted corn prices would stabilize after Tuesday's
sell-off.
   ``The market will go to wherever the demand price is,'' he said.
``My feeling is that don't have to go down too much farther in
corn'' to attract buyers.
   Contracts for deferred deliveries of unleaded gasoline soared the
2-cents-a-gallon daily limit on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
speculation that new pollution-control standards taking effect this
year in several Northeastern states will raise the price of gasoline
production, analysts said.
   The new regulations in states including Massachusetts and New
York create a more stringent standard for a characteristic of
gasoline that is related to automobile exhaust emissions, said
Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
in New York.
   Crude oil for near-month delivery finished the day at a new
14-month high of $18.95 a barrel after trading as high as $19.21.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 30 cents
higher with February at $18.95; heating oil was .11 cent lower to
.13 cent higher with February at 53.05 cents a gallon; ands unleaded
gasoline was .19 cent to 2 cents higher with February at 51.10 cents
a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures advanced on New York's Commodity
Exchange, reflecting the U.S. dollar's weakness against major
foreign currencies.
   Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents higher with February at $404 a
troy ounce; silver was 5.3 cents to 5.4 cents higher with March at
$6.01 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled unchanged
to .30 cent higher with February at 74.35 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with January at 85 cents a
pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to .22 cent higher with
February at 44.92 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25
cent lower to .23 cent higher with February at 42.25 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of stocks
represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled .60 point
lower at 286.10. The contract is worth $500 a point.

<HEAD>Former Sperry Chairman Dies At 65</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friday funeral services have been set for
former Sperry Corp. Chairman Gerald G. Probst, who died in Salt Lake
City over the weekend. He was 65.
   Probst was named chairman and chief executive officer of Sperry
in Sept. 1986 when the $5 billion computer and defense systems
company merged with Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys Corp.
   He retired a few months later but continued to serve as a member
of Unisys International's advisory board.
   Probst died Sunday while sleeping at his Salt Lake City home, the
company and family said in a statement. The cause of death had not
been determined as of Tuesday, said Carolyn Rowes of Unisys.
   Probst was born in Ogden, Utah, on Sept. 11, 1923. He joined the
Air Force in 1942 out of high school and was commissioned a pilot
officer.
   He commanded a B-24 bomber in World War II missions over Europe,
for which he was awarded the distinguished flying cross and the air
medal with three oak leaf clusters.
   Following war service, Probst attended the University of Utah and
earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He then
returned to serve in the Air Force's Research and Development
Command.
   During military service, he attended Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and received a masters degree in electrical engineering.
   Probst joined Sperry Univac in St. Paul, Minn., in 1961. He was
named to positions of increasing responsibility over the next
decade, being promoted to a divisional presidency in 1971.
   Probst became corporate vice president in 1974, executive vice
president in 1975 and company president in 1980. He was elected
chairman of Sperry on June 1, 1982.
   Probst also served many years as a member of the board of Mellon
Bank, Pittsburgh; trustee of the Logistic Command Institute,
Washington; and chairman of the University of Utah's National
Advisory Council.
   Probst is survived by his widow, the former Betty Forbes Nelson,
four children and 16 grandchildren.

   The dollar value of acquisitions in the computer
software and services industry shot up 70 percent in 1988, according
to a survey released Tuesday.
   Among the 434 deals done last year were a record 14 valued at
more than $100 million, according to Broadview Associates, an
investment banker that does a quarterly survey for Adapso, the
computer software and services industry association.
   Overall, the transactions were valued at a record $8.4 billion,
up from $4.9 billion in 1987, Broadview said. The number of deals
rose 21 percent from 358 in 1987.
   The biggest deal was the $1.6 billion purchase of IMS
International Inc. by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp, Broadview said.
   Many of the buyers were big companies that preferred to buy
established companies rather than try to build software and services
businesses from scratch.
   For private companies, being acquired can enrich the original
owners while giving their company the resources to continue its
growth. The alternative of making a public stock offering is
unattractive in the current market, Broadview said.

   Federal charges were announced Tuesday against 18
former employees of First Commodity Corp. of Boston, alleging they
defrauded more than 2,600 investors of some $40 million.
   The charges stem from an ongoing investigation in Chicago,
Boston, New York, Miami and San Francisco _ the largest single
investigation of its kind ever undertaken by federal officials, U.S.
Attorney Anton Valukas said at a news conference.
   The former employees, named in a federal grand jury indictment
and criminal information, are accused of using high-pressure sales
tactics to persuade customers from around the country to invest in
high-stakes commodity ventures misrepresented as being low-risk.
   More than $22 million of the investments was lost, Valukas said.
   Those named Tuesday include the failed company's former national
vice president for sales, two branch managers, and 15 former
salesmen and managers from its former offices in Chicago and
suburban Oak Brook, Ill., Valukas said. The criminal information
includes charges by his office while the indictment includes charges
by the grand jury.
   The defendants are charged with a total of 187 counts of wire
fraud and mail fraud, racketeering and racketeering conspiracy.
   They include David C. Connolly, 48, of Teaneck, N.J., the former
national sales vice president for the company; Ross A. Barnard, 37,
of suburban Hinsdale, Ill., former branch manager of the Oak Brook
office; and Stephen L. Barnard, 38, of suburban Flossmoor, Ill.,
former house broker of the Chicago office.
   Neither Connolly nor the Barnards could be reached for comment.
The Barnards have unpublished telephone numbers and Connolly was not
listed in the Teaneck telephone listings.
   If convicted, those charged could face lengthy prison terms and
thousands of dollars in fines.
   In the alleged scheme, customers were solicited by telephone by
First Commodity sales representatives posing as phony commodities
experts. Those representatives often made repeated phone calls using
``scripts'' handed out by managers, Valukas said.
   Investors were falsely told that ``commodity trading was not
risky ... and would lead to high profits,'' he said.
   ``In fact ... the defendants knew almost all of (First
Commodity's) customers lost money,'' Valukas said.
   During the alleged scheme, from 1980 to February 1987, $100
million in sales was brought in to the company's Chicago and Oak
Brook offices, and $63 million of that was lost, Valukas said.
   More than $40.6 million of those sales and more than $22.7
million of the losses were attributable to the former employees
named in the complaints, Valukas said. He declined to say whether
more charges were forthcoming, but noted that the investigation is
continuing nationwide.
   Three other former First Commodity employees pleaded guilty to
similar charges in December and have been cooperating in the probe,
Valukas said.
   ``It is a sad reality that sophisticated and deceptive sales
techniques can yield great profits to those willing to use them,''
he said. ``These cases should serve as a clear warning that fraud
and deception in the offer and sale of commodity contracts _ in
whatever form it takes _ will be thoroughly investigated and
vigorously prosecuted.''
   Founded in the late 1970s, First Commodity rapidly grew into one
of the nation's leading futures trading companies. But it collapsed
in 1987 beneath a mountain of investor lawsuits and federal
investigations.

<HEAD>Fannie Mae's Net Off in Fourth Quarter But Record High in Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal National Mortgage Association Tuesday
reported a 22 percent drop in fourth-quarter income from the year
before, but for all of 1988 profit rose to a record level.
   Fannie Mae, as the federally-chartered private corporation is
commonly known, said after-tax income totaled $152.7 million, or
$1.91 a share, in the final three months of 1988, down from $195
million, or $2.42 a share, in the corresponding 1987 quarter.
   Results for the entire year were better. In 1988, Fannie Mae had
after-tax income of $506.7 million, up 34.8 percent from $376
million the prior year and a record annual amount. That translated
to per-share earnings of $6.43 and $4.66 in the two respective
periods.
   ``Fannie Mae's record 1988 income successfully caps a year in
which the company celebrated the 50th anniversary of its creation
and its 20th year as a private company,'' said David O. Maxwell,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Fannie Mae is the nation's largest investor in home mortgages.
   Maxwell attributed last year's earnings growth to an increase in
the spread between the yield on the corporation's investment
portfolio and the cost of its debt outstanding, an increase in the
company's average investment portfolio, continued expansion in fee
income from mortgage-backed securities and a decline in the tax rate.
   Also beneficial was a decline in properties having to be taken
over due to foreclosures. Such acquisitions have fallen in each of
the past five quarters.
   The provision for losses on mortgage loans was reduced in the
fourth quarter to $85 million from $120 million in 1987's final
quarter.
   Part of the reason for the drop in the latest quarterly earnings
was that the 1987 results included adjustments associated with
changes undertaken following implementation of a new accounting
standard.
   Without the changes, earnings in the fourth 1987 quarter would
have been $60 million, or 75 cents a share and earnings for all of
that year would have been $242 million, or $2.98 a share.
   As of Dec. 31, Fannie Mae's assets totaled $112.1 billion, up 8.5
percent from $103.5 billion at the end of 1987.

   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. on Tuesday
projected a 53 percent decline in its 1988 fourth-quarter earnings
from continuing operations and attributed the anticipated drop to a
soft domestic tire market.
   The company estimated that 1988 fourth-quarter earnings from
continuing operations would be 53 percent lower than the $119.4
million recorded for the same period in 1987.
   A previous company estimate projected earnings for that quarter
at 40 percent to 45 percent lower than the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Tax charges from unusual items are expected to be approximately
$26 million, rather than $33 million previously estimated, the
company said.
   Goodyear will announce its fourth-quarter and 1988 results Feb.
14.

<HEAD>Court Orders Insurance Companies Into Receivership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Mutual Liability Insurance Co. and
American Mutual Insurance Co. were ordered by the state Supreme
Court into receivership Tuesday at the request of state Insurance
Commissioner Roger Singer.
   The action was prompted by concerns over the Wakefield companies'
reserve capacity to cover primarily high-risk policies written in
the 1960s and 1970s involving asbestos, medical malpractice and
toxic waste claims, Singer said.
   Under the order, which was supported by the companies, Singer was
named receiver and the companies were enjoined from issuing new
policies or proceeding with their business except as permitted by
Singer.
   The companies were authorized to continue paying automobile,
worker's compensation and certain disability and accident and health
claims, but will not renew or write new policies.
   The companies, formed 101 years ago, are licensed in all 50
states but primarily operate in the Northeast. They have 20,000
commercial policies nationwide and nearly 75,000 personal policies.
   Singer said the order was intended to protect policyholders while
the Insurance Division works with management ``in an effort to
improve the companies' financial condition.''
   The Insurance Division will report back to the high court within
30 days on ``whether to rehabilitate them in some ways or declare
them insolvent,'' Singer said. ``We will either have a plan to
somehow get them back on their feet or we'll have the court declare
them insolvent.''
   Singer and company spokesman Tom Synder said there is a
possibility that a portion of the companies may be sold.
   National Grange Mutual Insurance Co. of New Hampshire has signed
a letter of intent to buy a small, stock-controlled subsidiary of
the companies, American Policyholders Insurance Co., which is
unaffected by the order although it too will stop writing new
policies.
   Singer said National Grange has expressed interest in buying
American Policyholders, bringing 500 to 600 of American Mutual's
nearly 800 Wakefield headquarters employees on board and paying off
American Mutual's long-term claims.
   ``One of the big assets of this company (American Mutual) is a
well-trained, experienced work force,'' Singer said.
   Synder said National Grange will be reviewing the potential
acquisition over the next 30 days.
   In the meantime, American Mutual will be looking at cutting its
total 1,400-employee work force to handle only claims, Synder said.
No decision on layoffs has been made yet.
   Singer said the companies' reserve capacity has been under review
by the Insurance Division since 1985. Since then, American Mutual
has brought in new management, sold off assets and upgraded its
business.
   ``During the past several years, the company has made great
strides in strengthening its reserves to pay losses,'' American
Mutual President J. John Wortman said. ``The reserve accounts have
been strengthened by over $250 million since 1986.
   ``However, some very recent changes in payment patterns on old
losses indicate that even more reserves may be necessary,'' he said.
   Singer said the discovery a few weeks ago of $500 million to $700
million in potential long-term claim exposure prompted one investor
interested in buying all three companies to back out and the
Insurance Division's decision to seek the receivership order.
   Synder said it was unclear what direction American Mutual will
take in 30 days. But he said, ``We, obviously, are not going to be
the size or shape of company that we were in the past. It all
depends on what we can bring out of this.''

<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. announced plans to
cut prices on some of its Macintosh line on Tuesday and then saw its
stock drop sharply in heavy trading.
   The announcement coincided with the company releasing figures for
its first fiscal quarter that showed it had a 16 percent increase in
earnings compared to a year earlier.
   The stock fell $3.37{ a share, or 8 percent, to $40.62{ in the
over-the-counter market.
   Some analysts said the stock's sudden spill was unjustified.
   ``It's a highly nervous market and Apple is a highly visible
stock,'' said analyst Bruce Lupatkin of Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
   ``There's nothing wrong and Apple is stronger than ever,'' said
Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, Inc., of Santa
Clara.
   Apple said it will decrease prices in its USA division on some
Macintosh personal computers, memory expansion kits and hard disk
drives.
   Allan Loren, the division president, said the company hoped the
price cuts on its more advanced models of Macintosh would bring more
customers to them.
   ``Unit sales increased over 30 percent in the United States and
at an even greater rate internationally,'' he said. ``But we also
experienced a shift in the unit mix toward less-costly,
less-configured Macintosh systems.''
   He said the company ``decided to selectively drop prices in the
U.S. to more fully expand momentum for the full range of our
Macintosh product line.''
   The company said net income for the quarter was $140.5 million,
16 percent above the $121.4 million earned in the same period a year
ago. Earnings per share for the quarter that ended Dec. 30 were
$1.10, up from the 92 cents per share.
   Net sales were $1.4 billion, a 35 percent increase over the
year-ago figure.
   International sales accounted for 32 percent of total revenues
during the quarter, compared to 28 percent in the first quarter of
fiscal 1988, according to a company statement.
   The company's profits rose 84 percent in the last fiscal year,
exceeding analysts' expectations.
   ``The numbers were essentially in line with expectations,''
Lupatkin said of Tuesday's report.
   Regarding the announcement of the price cut, Lupatkin said the
company could be ``repositioning existing products in anticipation
of a new product introduction.''
   ``I also think the price decline reflects the general slowing of
overall industry growth,'' the analyst added.
   The company pointed to its commitment to new products in
Tuesday's announcement.

<HEAD>Ex-Employee Claims IBM Fired Him for Balking at South African Transfer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former International Business Machines Corp.
employee, who claims he was fired for refusing a transfer to South
Africa, has filed a $25 million lawsuit against the computer giant.
   Victor S. Khabo, a black naturalized U.S. citizen born in
Pretoria, South Africa, claimed he balked at the transfer to South
Africa because he still faces charges for his anti-apartheid
activities there.
   A former IBM marketing representative, Khabo sued the Armonk,
N.Y.-based company earlier this week at federal court in Manhattan,
accusing IBM of alleged unlawful employment practices.
   On Tuesday, however, an IBM spokeswoman disputed Khabo's claim.
   ``The termination was not related to South Africa. South Africa
was not an issue,'' said Theo Chisholm in a telephone interview.
   IBM announced plans to sell its South African holdings to
employees there in October 1986. Ms. Chisholm said that as of March
1987, IBM had no assets or employees in South Africa.
   She declined to say more, adding: ``We don't comment on cases
that are in litigation.''
   According to Khabo's lawsuit, he was hired by IBM in June 1984
and a year later, was asked to join South African students being
trained to work at IBM's division in South Africa.
   But Khabo, a New Brunswick, N.J., resident with masters degrees
in economics and business administration, claimed he told company
officials that he couldn't go back to his homeland unless the
political system there changed.
   In 1963, when he was 16, according to the lawsuit, Khabo was
twice arrested as a leader in the African Student Association. He
was released the first time but sentenced to 21 months hard labor
the second time.
   In 1975, according to court papers, Khabo _ who already was
living in the United States _ was named a co-conspirator in an
alleged 1963 plot to overthrow the South African government.
   Khabo claimed that after he refused the transfer to South Africa,
he was passed over for assignment to a sales territory and was
denied funds for courses to complete his doctorate, despite previous
company promises to do so.
   In addition to IBM, the lawsuit named four of Khabo's former
managers and IBM Chairman John F. Akers as co-defendants.
