   David and James Taggart lied when they
said PTL founder Jim Bakker authorized them to take ministry money
they used to buy property and jewelry, a prosecutor said Monday
before deliberations began in the Taggarts' tax evasion trial.
   The jury started deliberations just after 5 p.m. on the 12th day
of the trial. Jurors left after three hours and were to resume
Tuesday.
   ``In a nutshell, this case is about power,'' prosecutor David
Brown said in his closing statement in the brothers' trial. ``The
power David Taggart and his brother exercised at PTL to line their
own pockets.''
   The Taggarts are charged with evading $525,000 in income taxes
after spending nearly $1.2 million in PTL money on personal
luxuries such as condominums, jewelry, expensive cars and designer
clothes. The trial began July 5.
   If convicted, each brother could be sentenced to 25 years in
prison and face fines of more than $1 million.
   The defense rested Thursday following two days of testimony from
the Taggarts, who began at PTL as piano players. U.S. District
Judge Robert Potter gave no reasons for then postponing Friday's
session.
   Within a few years of joining PTL in the late 1970s, David
Taggart, 32, was Bakker's top personal aide. James, 35, was the
interior designer at PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat just
south of Charlotte.
   Before his closing remarks, defense attorney Ben Cotten placed
items from such exclusive New York stores as Cartier and Gucci on a
bench in front of the jury. ``If what is on trial here is a
lifestyle you don't like, then we didn't need a trial at all,'' he
said.
   Brown told the jury that the government's case was made more
difficult by some of the witnesses _ including the two defendants.
   ``If you're not offended by the evidence of how they spent the
money they took from PTL ... you should be offended by the fact
that both defendants got on the stand and lied,'' Brown said.
   He said there was ample evidence to support the government's
case.
   David Taggart showed ``audacity and greed'' when he testified he
was entitled to be paid at a level similar to Bakker.
   ``Jim Bakker never authorized it, never, not once. David Taggart
took the stand and lied to you and David Taggart and James Taggart
conspired to take money from PTL and not pay taxes on it,'' Brown
said. He referred to Taggart's testimony that he had authority from
Bakker to take large cash advances and use PTL blank checks.
   David Taggart testified last week that his way of accounting for
the $1.2 million was to submit documentation to justify it, receive
a tax form from PTL that called the cash advances income or that
the cash advances would be considered a loan which would be
converted into a bonus.
   Cotten used his closing arguments to return to testimony about a
verbal agreement he said was reached between David Taggart and
Bakker in 1983. He asked the jurors not to dismiss the agreement
simply because it was an oral contract.
   Cotten said Bakker agreed to give David Taggart access to the
same resources he enjoyed. ``The intent was not to beat the IRS out
of money. It was to have PTL shoulder the burden,'' Cotten said.'

security secretary.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appointed new
foreign and defense secretaries Monday, fired two Cabinet ministers
and switched around others in the biggest government shake-up since
she won power 10 years ago.
   Mrs. Thatcher named John Major, one of the least-known members
of her 22-member Cabinet, as the new foreign secretary, making him
a prime contender to succeed her.
   He replaces Sir Geoffrey Howe, who was moved to a vacant post as
deputy prime minister. Howe will also lead the governing
Conservative Party in the House of Commons.
   The prime minister, battling to halt her government's slide in
popularity, also put new appointees in an array of major posts
including the portfolios for Northern Ireland and the environment.
   Mrs. Thatcher fired her harassed Transport Secretary Paul
Channon, who had been accused of bungling bomb warnings before Pan
Am Flight 103 was blown up over Scotland on Dec. 21, and Social
Security Secretary John Moore.
   The two other Cabinet ministers to depart _ Defense Secretary
George Younger and Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young _ said
they were resigning to resume business careers.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King was named defense secretary
in an apparent reward after four years as Britain's top official in
the embattled province.
   The appointment of Major as foreign secretary was a big step up
from his former Cabinet post as chief secretary to the treasury,
the No. 2 financial official.
   The 46-year-old son of a circus trapeze artist was raised in
poverty in south London's rundown Brixton district, never went to
university and worked as a building laborer before making a career
in banking.
   He entered Parliament in the May 1979 general election that
brought Mrs. Thatcher to power and ousted a socialist Labor Party
government.
   His appointment underlined the transformation of the hierarchy
of the Conservative Party, once the preserve of the British upper
classes, since Mrs. Thatcher, a grocer's daughter, took over.
   ``We now know, without the need for guesswork, who her chosen
successor will be,'' London's liberal Guardian newspaper commented
Tuesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 63, is widely expected to retire some time after
bidding for an unprecedented fourth successive term at the next
election. It must be held by mid-1992.
   The move of Howe, 62, to deputy prime minister was widely
regarded as a demotion from one of the most prestigious jobs in the
Cabinet.
   Mrs. Thatcher also brought into the Cabinet another member of
the class of 1979, Christopher Patten, a rising star from the
party's liberal wing, as the new environment secretary.
   Reflecting anxiety at the government's drop in the polls and its
drubbing in elections for the European Parliament last month, Mrs.
Thatcher shifted Education Secretary Kenneth Baker to the
chairmanship of the Conservative Party.
   Party chairman Peter Brooke was named Northern Ireland
Secretary, a tough job that effectively removes the incumbent from
day-to-day contact with party political issues in mainland Britain.
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson, a Thatcher favorite whose
political career was interrupted after a scandal over an
extramarital liaison six years ago, was named transport secretary.
   He resigned from the Cabinet in 1983 after news broke that his
ex-secretary, with whom he had an affair, was carrying his child.
Mrs. Thatcher brought him back into the Cabinet when she won a
third term in May 1987.
   The shake-up, announced after Mrs. Thatcher summoned government
ministers to her Downing Street office for private meetings,
appeared aimed primarily at freshening the government's image.
   Beset by rising inflation, a revival of labor union militancy
and facing a much tougher challenge from the revived Labor Party,
Mrs. Thatcher has trailed Labor seven to 15 points in polls since
the spring.
   Patten succeeded Nicholas Ridley, a chain-smoking scion of an
aristocratic family, who was named trade and industry secretary.
   Ridley, accused by critics of mishandling the current passage
through Parliament of a controversial new tax, is deeply unpopular
with many party members, who blame him for worsening the
government's poll standing.
   But Mrs. Thatcher, who has the sole power to appoint Cabinet
ministers, has repeatedly defended him.
   The dismissal of Transport Secretary Channon, an heir to the
Guinness brewing fortune and reputedly the richest member of the
Cabinet, had been predicted.
   In the aftermath of the Pan Am disaster, his department was
accused of being tardy about passing on detailed bomb warnings to
airlines. Critics also said he mishandled current strikes by
employees of British Rail and the London Underground.
   Other new Cabinet appointments announced were Norman Lamont as
treasury secretary and John Gummer as Agriculture Minister. Both
previously held government jobs outside the Cabinet.
   John Wakeham, Conservative Party leader in the Commons, became
the new energy secretary, and Tony Newton, former trade minister,
the new social security secretary.

<HEAD>Man Accused of Killing Actress Said to Have Gone to Samantha Smith's
Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man accused of killing actress Rebecca
Schaeffer reportedly traveled to the Maine hometown of Samantha
Smith, the young girl whose 1983 visit to the Soviet Union drew
international attention
   Police investigators were told that Robert John Bardo, now 19,
ran away and traveled to Maine four or five years ago to be near
the Smith girl, the Tucson Citizen reported Saturday.
   In July 1983, Miss Smith, then 11, went to the Soviet Union for
a two-week tour at the invitation of the late Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov. She had written a letter to Andropov, asking the world
leader whether he favored war.
   In an unusual move, he responded to her letter, telling her the
Soviet people had peaceful intentions and inviting her to visit his
country.
   Two years later, on Aug. 25, 1985, she and her father were
killed in a plane crash near Auburn, Maine.
   Dan Andrews, a Los Angeles homicide detective, said he heard the
Smith story from an acquaintance of Bardo. Andrews would not
identify the acquaintance.
   Detective Sgt. Charles Armijo said Bardo's father, Phillip A.
Bardo Jr., told Tucson police detectives after his son's arrest
that the son had developed the obsession for Miss Smith and had run
away to find her.
   Armijo said detectives were told Bardo had gotten within several
blocks of the Smith home but was picked up by police when he asked
for directions. Bardo was returned to his parents.
   Bardo was arrested in Tucson last Wednesday, one day after Ms.
Schaeffer was gunned down at her apartment building in Los Angeles.
   He is jailed in lieu of $1 million bail, and his lawyer has said
Bardo will fight extradition to California.
   Neither Armijo nor Andrews indicated they thought Bardo was
thinking of harming the young girl.
   Bardo's father, Phillip, declined to comment on the Smith matter.
   ``We're not discussing anything with anyone,'' the elder Bardo
said. ``Later on we'll release a statement, but we're kind of
sorting it out ourselves right now.''

   Police issued a murder warrant Monday for
a 44-year-old drifter accused of killing two people aboard a county
bus and wounding another motorist while stealing his car.
   Joseph Besaraba was charged with two counts of murder, one count
of armed robbery, one count of attempted murder, said Hollywood
Police Det. Darron Cansiglione.
   Police circulated a photo of Besaraba among homeless men at the
food program of the First Lutheran Church in Fort Lauderdale. The
man reportedly used the program as an address.
   ``The police contacted us early yesterday because they said they
had this address,'' First Lutheran Pastor Robb Grimm told The Miami
Herald. Late Monday, police announced they had signed a warrant for
Besaraba, known by the nickname ``Crazy Joe'' to other homeless men
at the shelter.
   ``He was wild and spontaneous,'' said Larry Brown, who knew
Besaraba from the shelter.
   Witnesses said the gunman had been drinking wine at the stop in
front of a supermarket in Hollywood, a suburb north of Miami. He
stepped into the door of the bus after it pulled up and opened fire
at the driver and sprayed bullets through bus windows.
   ``The door opened. He stood up, reached under his shirt and
pulled out a gun,'' said Devin Oppy, 28, a passenger in the rear of
the bus. ``The driver looked at him and he shot him three times in
the head. He didn't say a word. People were screaming and jumping
on the floor. I kept saying, `Get down!'''
   Sydney Granger, 43, a driver for the Broward County Transit
Authority, was killed. An immigrant from Grenada with several
children, he was making his last round and had about 30 minutes
left on his shift. The passenger on the bus had been identified but
his name was not released by midday Monday until next of kin could
be told.
   No special safety procedures were planned after the shooting,
because it appeared to be a random incident, ``nothing that could
be deemed a vendetta against bus drivers,'' said Joel Volinski, a
spokesman for Broward County Transit.
   He said two bus drivers who knew the victim stayed out of work
Monday, but most drivers had shown ``a surprisingly stable
reaction.''
   ``We've tried to have our own supervisors and superintendents
keep a greater visibility and availability to the operators,'' he
said. ``They might be at transfer locations or in their car where
certain buses are scheduled to stop.''
   After the initial shootings, the gunman walked through the
supermarket parking lot to an intersection and banged his gun on
the window of a car, witnesses said.
   Scott Yaguda, 31, a tourist from Alexandria, Va., surrendered
his car and was walking away when the gunman shot him three times
in the lower left leg and twice in the back, witnesses said.
   ``The (gunman) seemed like he didn't have a care in the world,''
said Susan Miller, 40, who ran to call police. ``He just lifted his
arm and bang, bang, bang.'' She said Yaguda ``was backing away. He
had no reason to shoot him.''
   Yaguda was in Memorial Hospital in critical but stable condition
Monday, hospital spokeswoman Cynthia Wine said.

<HEAD>Report: Coors Letter Allegedly Cleared Way For Denver Project's Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Coors, the wealthy Colorado brewer and a
friend of President Reagan, wrote Samuel R. Pierce Jr. to endorse a
request for more than $16 million in rent subsidies for Denver
housing projects, according to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in its Monday editions that the
endorsement two years ago by Coors came as the request appeared
headed for rejection.
   The Times based the information on Coors on internal government
documents.
   It also quoted former senior housing official Thomas T. Demery
as saying a HUD selection committee was told that Pierce, then the
department's secretary, wanted the Denver application given ``very
careful consideration, which it was.''
   The newspaper said the finding followed other revelations that
during the Reagan administration, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development was more likely to approve projects endorsed by
prominent Republicans, former Reagan aides and friends of Pierce.
   Documents showed the Denver proposal was originally left off a
list of 1987 applications to be recommended for financing.
   On Aug. 12, 1987, Coors wrote Pierce urging him to ``look into
this matter and give it your favorable approval.''
   One week after the letter was written, the selection panel met
in Washington and approved the Denver request, the Times said
documents showed.

   Kayla Mull raises petite potbellied pigs
that skateboard, squeal and sit up for their supper.
   One pig plays ``Swine Lake'' on the piano; a swimming pig has
been known to perform the ``swine dive.''
   ``They are new and marginally hip,'' said Carolyn Gray, a writer
for Pet Care Report. ``They are friendly, relaxed, and you can
housebreak them, which are the big three as far as I'm concerned.''
   The little swine are selling big in Beverly Hills.
   ``Yes, it's a trend. If you have your BMW, you have to have a
pig now,'' said an owner of two little pigs who wanted his name
withheld because of zoning violations. (The mini-pigs, originally
bred in China, can be raised legally only in areas zoned for
livestock.)
   ``They make really darling pets,'' said Gwenna Blackmore of
Rolling Hills Estates. ``They are clean, smart, and they are fun.''
   ``They are easier to potty train than a dog,'' said Micky, Ms.
Blackmore's daughter, who bought a male pig when it was one month
old. ``He sits on command. Of course, you have to give him a treat,
which is just about anything.''
   Ms. Mull, a 37-year-old microbiologist, is leading the pack of
pig breeders. Prices for the pigs start at $1,500 each.
   ``Everyone who has ever owned a pet pig, even for a week or two,
will tell you how much fun it was,'' she said. ``Even if it ended
up as dinner in six months.''

   A man sporting a scruffy white beard and
macho persona swaggered off with top honors in the Ernest Hemingway
Look-alike Contest as this city ended a weeklong tribute to the
author.
   The Hemingway Days Festival attracted more than 6,000 visitors
to celebrate what would have been ``Papa's'' 90th birthday. The
festival also included fishing and writing contests, as well the
dedication of the Hemingway postage stamp.
   Richard Royston, a 55-year-old investor from Atlanta, beat out
47 other entrants Sunday.
   ``I know right now half my English professors from college are
jubilant and the other half are turning over in their graves,''
Royston said.
   Ray Mize, from Washington D.C., placed first among 607 entrants
in the festival's short story contest.
   His work, entitled ``The Blooding,'' is a Midwestern folk tale
of how people become hardened to life. Bob Shacochis, a writer for
Harper's magazine and one of several judges, described the
adventure as ``a story as American as Thanksgiving dinner'' and
``crystal clear.''
   Hemingway wrote classics such as ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,''
``A Farewell to Arms,`` ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' and ``Green
Hills of Africa,'' while living in Key West in the 1930s.

   Mexico reached agreement with its creditor
banks late Sunday on a package that is expected to make significant
reductions in Mexico's foreign debt burden, the second largest in
the developing world.
   The agreement, which provides banks with three options to chose
from in providing assistance to Mexico, marks the first
breakthrough for the Bush administration's Third World debt
strategy.
   Officials involved in the talks estimated that the package had
the potential of reducing by up to one-third the $4.5 billion in
payments Mexico must make annually to service the $54 billion it
owes to commercial banks.
   However, the exact benefits of the plan will not be known for
many months until the individual banks holding the loans make
decisions regarding the extent to which they will participate in
the debt reduction package arrived at Sunday.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari hailed the accord in
a nationwide television and radio address in that country. He said
it answered ``the cry of Mexicans to return to growth'' and
``opened a breach'' for other countries with similar debt problems.
   Salinas described the negotiations as ``difficult, complex and
tense.''
   The successful conclusion of the negotiations came after U.S.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan joined in the final stages of the marathon discussions.
   Brady, emerging after the talks ended late Sunday, said, ``You
see a lot of smiles around here,'' but he refused to discuss
specifics of the final agreement.
   However, another official, who spoke on condition that his name
not be used, said the final package offers banks two ways to
provide debt relief to Mexico.
   They can agree to reduce the principal on the old loans by 35
percent or they can agree to reduce the interest being charged on
the loans to 6.25 percent. A third option commercial banks will
have is providing new loans to Mexico.
   Those banks willing to reduce principal or cut the interest
charged will be able to get guarantees on the remaining debt from
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the two
multinational lending agencies that are backing the
administration's debt strategy.
   In a statement, Brady called the Mexican agreement ``a major
step forward in the implemenation'' of the administration's debt
reduction initiative.
   ``The agreement between Mexico and its creditor banks will
provide significant debt and debt-service reduction for Mexico, as
well as new money, to support Mexico's economic growth,'' Brady
said.
   He said the United States, working with other countries, was
willing to offer Mexico short-term financing of up to $2 billion
until Mexico began receiving the new money agreed to in the plan.
   The negotiating teams for the final agreement were led by
Mexican Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe and John Reed, chairman of
Citicorp and the head of the committee representing commerical
banks in the talks.
   Both men were smiling when they emerged from the talks, held in
Brady's office and various conference rooms on the third floor of
the U.S. Treasury.
   The official Mexican new agency, Notimex, said there were
last-minute negotiations over a ``readjustment clause'' that would
increase debt payments once the Mexican economy got moving again.
   But the official who discussed the talks said that both sides
had agreed to tie increased debt payments to any improvements in
Mexico's export sales after the year 1996.
   The so-called ``readjustment clause'' has reportedly been a
sticking point in the talks, with Mexico maintaining that raising
debt payments at a later date might block an economic recovery that
the cuts are designed to foster.
   The fact that Brady and Greenspan were both participating in the
talks was an indication of the high priority the United States has
placed on completing a deal with Mexico, the country which is
considered the test case for the administration's new initiative to
reduce debt.
   Last March, Brady unveiled the strategy which sought to reduce a
portion of the $1.3 trillion debt burden being carried by Third
World nations by offering various inducements to persuade
commercial banks to forgive a portion of their loans.
   The administration had hoped to have a finished Mexican debt
package to present during the seven-nation economic summit held
week in Paris. To help move the talks along, President Bush held a
hurriedly scheduled meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari.
   While the talks between Mexico and its creditor banks failed to
arrive at a breakthrough before the summit ended, Bush was
successful in winning backing for the strategy in the final
economic communique.
   The administration also announced in Paris that the United
States was prepared to put up between $1 billion and $2 billion as
an emergency ``bridge'' loan to supply money until funds start
arriving from the commercial banks.
   ``With this accord we have achieved our goal of reducing from 6
to 2 percent (of the gross national product) our net transfers
abroad,'' an anonymous source close to the talks said, according to
Notimex.
   The $54 billion owed to private banks represents about half of
Mexico's $107 billion foreign debt, the second largest in the
developing world after Brazil's.
   Reducing the crushing debt is the centerpiece of President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari's policy. It is seen in Mexico as the key
to getting the nation's stagnant economy moving again.
   Mexico's debt crisis began with a borrowing spree during the oil
boom years of the late 1970s. When the bottom fell out of the oil
market in 1982, the Mexican economy went into a tailspin that has
seen the average worker's buying power fall by half.
   The economic crisis sparked fears of political instability as
unhappy Mexicans began turning against the party that has ruled for
60 uninterrupted years. Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, was
held to the smallest margin of victory in party history in last
year's presidential elections.

whereabouts of my husband, John Charles Cooper, ex-chairman of
Cooper Industries PLC., would they please inform him that I
divorced him today and was granted sole custody of our children.
Thank you.''
   But on Sunday night Mrs. Cooper, also 41, was quoted as telling
the Daily Express newspaper she would remarry her husband ``if he
ever gets this out of his system and comes back to us.''
   The report said Cooper was believed to be living on his luxury
yacht off the Spanish island of Majorca.
   The Sun newspaper quoted Mrs. Cooper as saying at her home near
Wolverhampton in the English Midlands: ``I still love John. My only
worry is that he might get snapped up on his travels by some smart
bimbo.''

<TEXT>
   In a continent littered with economic
disasters, Namibia heads toward independence as a potential success
if it can meet the demands of poor blacks without alienating
wealthy whites and foreign investors.
   The desert territory has profitable mining, fishing and farming
industries and one of the best infrastructures in Africa, much of
it built with money from South Africa.
   White-controlled South Africa has administered Namibia, also
known as South-West Africa, for 74 years under a mandate from the
defunct League of Nations.
   Namibia's per capita income of about $1,000 annually is among
the highest in Africa. But economists say its independence could
bring a sharp economic decline and they list these reasons:
   _ South Africa, which has provided up to 25 percent of Namibia's
$750 million annual budget, is expected to cut virtually all aid
after independence, expected early next year.
   _ Thousands of Namibia's whites, concerned about the future
under a black-led government, are expected to leave the country or
move their assets to neighboring South Africa.
   _ Leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization, the
guerrilla group expected to win pre-independence elections in
November, have virtually no hands-on economic experience. They
proclaim socialist policies associated with crumbling economies
elsewhere in Africa.
   ``SWAPO does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority of
socialism over capitalism,'' the organization said in an election
manifesto.
   ``The state will have ownership of a significant part of the
country's economic resources,'' it said. ``Egalitarianism forms the
basis of (SWAPO's) vision of a just social order.''
   Such promises are popular among the black majority in a
territory where the unemployment rate is estimated at 25 percent
and few blacks own homes or businesses.
   Will it work?
   All the southern African nations that have relied heavily on
state control of the economy _ Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania
and Mozambique _ have suffered economic declines or fallen short of
their potential.
   Botswana, the one black-ruled country in the region to pursue a
market-oriented economy, has prospered.
   ``SWAPO has raised expectations that will be difficult to meet
regardless of their policies,'' said Rainer Ritter, a private
economist in Windhoek.
   The organization has promised major improvements in education,
health care, housing and jobs.
   But SWAPO has not said how it will finance the programs. The
territory now has a budget deficit of about $180 million and a
foreign debt of more than $300 million.
   SWAPO will have to try to prevent a recession in the northern
towns and villages of the Ovambo tribe, where the organization
draws its strongest support.
   An estimated 50,000 South African soldiers have left Namibia
since the year-long independence plan took effect April 1. Most
were stationed in the north, where Namibians fought them but relied
on their money.
   Hundreds of small general stores, known as cuca shops, are
central to economic life in the north and are likely to suffer.
Thousands of Namibians employed by the military in jobs ranging
from soldiers to maids are now out of work.
   SWAPO has softened its hard-line socialist language in recent
months in an effort to encourage whites to stay and to attract
foreign investors.
   ``We will invite foreign investors to develop our economy,''
SWAPO President Sam Nujoma said recently in Cairo, Egypt. ``We do
not think the present moment is the time for nationalizations.''
   SWAPO also has made it clear it will accept a mixed economy and
needs the skills and capital of Namibia's 75,000 whites, who make
up 6 percent of the territory's 1.3 million people.
   Whites own an estimated 65 percent of private property in
Namibia and earn at least 10 times more than blacks on average,
according to SWAPO.
   SWAPO's main opponent, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, says
SWAPO's moderate tone will vanish if the organization comes to
power.
   SWAPO remains committed to ``an outdated and demonstrably
unsuccessful ideology _ that of doctrinaire socialism _ an ideology
that has already destroyed the economies of most African states,''
said the alliance, a multiracial coalition that favors a
market-oriented economy.
   The Namibian government, under South African control, already
accounts for more than half the territory's $1.3 billion gross
domestic product.
   Large diamond and uranium mining companies, owned by firms in
Britain and South Africa, make up the largest chunk of the private
sector.
   Consolidated Diamond Mining of Namibia, owned by De Beers of
South Africa, recently said SWAPO's economic views contain ``some
inaccuracies and a certain lack of realism.''
   But the company also said it was ``encouraged by (SWAPO's)
apparent willingness to negotiate'' and that willingness ``offers
scope for reconciliation between government and the private
sector.''

   Stuck in traffic? Tired of waiting for the
bus? Fed up with rising air fares?
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is trying to find out
what Americans want to do about it.
   But Skinner, in starting today a series of nationwide public
hearings aimed at coming up with a national transportation policy,
is asking for ideas, not complaints.
   ``You shouldn't go if you're just going to say, `We've got
gridlock, somebody ought to do something about it,' because we know
that,'' said Skinner in an interview. ``These are needs and idea
sessions.''
   Skinner, who carries a regular Washington Metrorail card in his
wallet and drives to work on the same jammed roads as this region's
other commuters, said the nation has been taking transportation for
granted.
   And he makes it clear this includes the Reagan administration.
Skinner is a former federal prosecutor and Chicago area transit
chief brought to Washington by President Bush.
   ``We've had a policy, but there hasn't been a coordinated
national policy,'' he said. ``There was an absence of planning, and
I happen to be a planner.''
   Skinner said the nation's airports, highways, bridges, waterways
and mass transit system are simply wearing out.
   ``We're going to have to rebuild it and replace it, or we're not
going to be able to rely on it anymore,'' he said.
   Among the most critical problems are a lack of planning for new
airports, Skinner said, and $80 billion worth of work on the
country's deteriorating bridges.
   The Transportation Department has scheduled 33 meetings in
cities ranging from Moscow, Idaho, to New York City.
   Meetings are to be moderated by department experts in various
fields, with sessions focusing on different subjects according to
the location.
   In Moscow on Wednesday, for example, it's rural needs, including
health care delivery, intercity buses and rail transport. In New
York on Sept. 8, it will be drug and alcohol use in the commercial
transportation system and federal research and development.
   The last meetings will be Sept. 11-12 in Boston.
   Skinner has asked for expert testimony at the hearings as well
as comments from anyone interested in improving any aspect of
highway, rail, air, or water transportation.
   Skinner has some of the most wide-ranging responsibilities in
the administration. He is Bush's point man in the Alaskan oil spill
because his department oversees both the Coast Guard and pipelines.
He's also issued key decisions affecting issues ranging from
automobile mileage standards to air terrorism.
   The department is accepting written suggestions until Sept. 1.
Skinner said he hopes to have a new set of transportation policies
in place before the end of his first year in the Cabinet.
   What will it all amount to when the policy is set?
   Skinner sees ambitious results affecting every American:
   ``Maybe it will eliminate gridlock. Maybe it will make it easier
for you to get to work. Maybe it will hold down air fares. Maybe it
will make you more productive in your job by making it easier to
get to various places in the country.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush a `Late Bloomer'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, rebounding from negative reviews
early in his presidency, is now winning good marks after two
successful trips to Europe and a general sense of economic
well-being at home.
   The president is ``a late bloomer,'' says one analyst.
   At the 100-day point, Bush was criticized as being too cautious,
unimaginative and unwilling to compete with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   After six months in office, Bush basks in praise for winning
support at a NATO summit for a U.S. plan to reduce conventional
arms in Europe, and for traveling to Poland and Hungary to
encourage democratic reforms.
   ``He's actually done well after a halting beginning,'' said
Thomas Cronin, a presidential scholar at Colorado College.
   Cronin said Bush was ``aided enormously by the fact that the
Democrats in Congress were in disarray'' as House Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas and House Whip Tony Coelho of California struggled
with ethical problems and then resigned. ``There was no challenge
to his leadership.''
   After losing a battle with Congress for confirmation of John
Tower as secretary of defense, Bush came back with a decisive
victory on his veto of a $1.20 increase in the minimum wage.
   ``He's obviously in a lot better shape than he was at 100
days,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution. ``He's had two awfully good trips abroad and when a
president travels abroad, he gets an awful lot of attention.''
   Larry Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist who
called Bush a late bloomer, said, ``It's as though there's a second
honeymoon at the six-month point.
   ``It's tied to real successes, particularly in the foreign
sphere, and things are going reasonably well abroad and at home,''
Sabato said. ``The economy may be slow but it's not in recession.
There's no war or threat of it, and things appear to be going in
our direction.''
   Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute, said Bush's foreign travels ``tilt the balance away from
the notion that the guy who was making things happen was Gorbachev
and that Bush was asleep at the switch.
   ``It erases the notion of a passive president who's doing
nothing,'' Ornstein said.
   At the White House, Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, said,
``It's nice to see the beginning of a response that everybody hoped
there would be.''
   Polls show Bush has a positive rating of 66 to 73 percent, which
puts him ahead of Ronald Reagan at this point in his presidency.
   Andy Kohut, president of Gallup Opinion Research, said Bush's
approval rating was slipping in April and May but then began to
turn around.
   ``Between May and July, he's been dealing with international
problems and the country tends to rally around a president who's
dealing with rather clear-cut international issues,'' said Kohut.
   On the other hand, Kohut said Bush is ``still an enigmatic
character to many people. That's where he's weak.'' He said the
category of people classified as ``don't know'' or ``no opinion''
about Bush is higher than with other presidents, running at about
26 percent.
   Countering that criticism, Sununu said ``vision doesn't fit on a
bumper sticker.''
   He said the president is defining his agenda with specific
proposals to balance the budget, bail out the savings and loan
industry, clean up air pollution and combat crime.
   Sununu said Bush has demonstrated ``a willingness to do his
homework, to spend the time examining the details, then to make a
decision not in haste.''
   Asked what Bush should have done differently, Sununu replied,
``Honest, in terms of the big issues and timetable and the agenda
and the approach, not a heck of a lot.''
   Ornstein said Bush should be more aggressive, establish a
long-term agenda and take some risks. Beyond that, he said Bush was
losing ``an awful lot of direction and momentum'' by the fact that
hundreds of top-level appointments have not been made.
   ``He could plummet the next six months if we slipped into a
recession,'' cautioned Sabato.
   ``There's a little too much basking in the glow of a 70 percent
approval rating, not capitalizing on it,'' Ornstein said. ``If
you're up around 70 percent early on, it's a good time to let it
drop down to 60 percent by pushing some things through that may be
a little controversial.''
   There is widespread agreement that much of Bush's popularity is
due to his personal style, his high energy level and obvious relish
for the job.
   ``I think we've grown used to him, like an old, comfortable
shoe,'' said Hess. ``Some of the rough edges from the campaign have
rubbed off. He hasn't forced himself on us.''
   Ornstein said Bush ``is not the kind of guy who's going to fall
asleep with the pope'' _ alluding to an occasion where Reagan
nodded off while meeting with John Paul II.
   Sununu said, ``I think people right off the bat perceived a
different style'' from the Reagan days. ``They have really begun to
feel comfortable and appreciative of the style. I think that is
very important for a president to do _ to give his mark to the
office that he probably will be occupying for eight years.''

<HEAD>Holy Batroots! Are Bats Related to Humans?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Holy Batroots! Is it really true, as some
scientists suggest, that human beings and bats might be distant
cousins who share the same primeval ancestors? Is there a Batman or
Count Dracula lurking in each of us?
   In the heat of this summer's batmania, with American moviegoers
breaking box-office records to see ``Batman,'' anything seems
possible.
   The National Zoo's bat expert, Dr. John Seidensticker, says it's
an intriguing theory, one you could sink your teeth into, but he's
not sure he believes it. Other scientists at the Smithsonian
Institution scoff at the idea.
   Seidensticker says brain studies have yielded evidence that
certain kinds of large bats found in Africa and the South Pacific
may be descendants of prehistoric primates akin to lemurs or
mouselike shrews.
   ``The theory is that these bats are really flying primates,'' he
says, and connected somehow in the evolutionary chain to the early
primate ancestors of monkeys, apes, gorillas _ and humans.
   But Dr. Charles Handley, a leading authority on bats and other
mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History,
says this theory is a ``hot potato'' of scientific controversy that
has won few adherents.
   ``We don't know what the ancestors of bats really were,''
Handley said.
   The 160 fluttering bats in the National Zoo's new Bat Cave
aren't talking.
   In fact, they don't display the slightest familial interest in
their supposed two-legged cousins who stare intently through a
glass wall into their dimly lighted hideaway of damp rocks and
hollow tree trunks.
   One recent visitor was Vice President Dan Quayle and his
children, who attended the Washington premiere of ``Batman'' at a
nearby movie theater and then joined a post-screening party for
1,200 guests in a tent outside the Bat Cave.
   Seidensticker, the zoo's associate curator of mammals,
illuminated the cave for Quayle with a flashlight. He said the vice
president was ``very interested'' in the bats and lingered for
seven minutes, much longer than the average tourist.
   Seidensticker said bats ``are not mice with wings, they are
bats,'' and people shouldn't be afraid of them.
   ``They actually are nice, fun, incredible animals,'' he says.
``They're great little guys.''
   Keeper Carol Prima, who wears a Batman baseball cap, says the
bats have never bothered her. ``They're not aggressive,'' she said.
``If anything, they're just curious.''
   They hover watchfully while she scrubs the cave walls or
delivers their meals. The bats, three species of fruit eaters,
consume 30 pounds of grapes, melons, bananas and a gruel of peach
nectar and vitamins every day.
   The rest of the time they fly back and forth, socialize in their
``harems'' and just hang out. Or, more precisely, hang down. They
also have active sex lives.
   ``They're continuously producing babies,'' Seidensticker says.
   Ms. Prima says she's never felt threatened working in the Bat
Cave.
   ``They never touch me, and they've never flown into my hair,''
she said. ``They keep their distance. They know you're there, but
they aren't interested in coming near you. They aren't accepting
you as a bat.''
   ``There's no need to fear these little guys,'' she says,
although some visitors have been seen anxiously sprinting past the
Bat Cave without a glance.
   The public's most frequently asked question, says Seidensticker,
is ``Where's the Batmobile?''

<HEAD>Congress Races Toward Summer Vacation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Action on Capitol Hill reaches a frenzied
level this week as lawmakers seek to pass a flurry of money bills,
grapple with how much to spend on the stealth bomber and clear
other legislative tangles before going on summer vacation.
   Leading the agenda in both the House and Senate is legislation
laying out Pentagon spending priorities for the coming year.
President Bush will be lobbying House members against an effort to
either freeze production of the B-2 bomber, known as the stealth
because of its radar-eluding capabilities, or cut the number to be
built from eight per year to two.
   Meanwhile, a House subcommittee is pushing ahead with its
investigation of the scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The House Government Operations housing subcommittee
summoned Lynda Murphy, a former career HUD employee, to testify
today about dealings with her friend, Deborah Gore Dean, a former
top HUD official.
   The administration contends that the stealth bomber, built to
penetrate Soviet airspace, is a key to future U.S. nuclear
deterrence. But members of Congress wrestling with serious deficit
problems are shocked at its cost _ more than half a billion dollars
each.
   Also to be fought is the perennial debate over how much to
devote to the administration's ``Star Wars'' Strategic Defense
Initiative and how much money to give to rail-mobile MX missiles
versus the single-warhead Midgetman.
   At the same time, the House is seeking to complete work on the
13 basic spending bills needed to run the government in the next
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Congress also is pushing ahead on
legislation from child care to clean air and budget cuts.
   Ms. Dean was executive assistant to former HUD secretary Samuel
Pierce, but numerous witnesses have described her as almost a
surrogate Cabinet member who was heavily involved in funneling
department money to well-placed Republicans.
   ``Miss Dean has chosen to take the Fifth Amendment, and we very
much hope that she will change her mind,'' said subcommittee
chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif. ``But we will need to get at her
role, if she's unprepared to testify, through individuals who had
close contact with her.''
   On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a
drafting session to deal with responses to last month's Supreme
Court's decision that burning the American flag is a protected form
of political expression.
   The panel's subcommittee on constitutional rights completed
hearings last week on the issue. Congress is divided over whether
to seek a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration or to
address the matter through a simple change in the law.
   After working behind closed doors most of last week, House and
Senate negotiators on a $166 bailout plan for the savings and loan
industry will meet Tuesday with hopes of nailing down a final
package.
   The major remaining disagreement is how to raise the $50 billion
needed immediately to cover the loss of federally insured deposits
in some 500 S&amp;Ls at or near insolvency because of poor and often
fraudulent lending.
   President Bush and the Senate want to raise the money through
30-year private bonds in order to prevent the bailout from swelling
the federal deficit. The House and Democrats would borrow the money
directly through the Treasury, but exempt the amount from annual
deficit reduction targets.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee could vote as early as Thursday
on the nomination of William C. Lucas to be Bush's assistant
attorney general for civil rights at the Justice Department.
   The black former sheriff of Wayne County, Michigan, is opposed
by many civil rights groups for lack of experience, but Bush
contends he will be a tough enforcer of anti-discrimination laws.
   And the House Ways and Means Committee continues work on a tax
bill, with members apparently divided almost down the middle on a
proposal favored by Bush to reduce taxes on capital gains.
   The panel also will try to find a way to change the surtax that
finances the catastrophic health insurance program for older
Americans. Higher income retirees who pay most of the cost of the
program have been lobbying the committee to spread the cost among
all taxpayers, not just older citizens.

<HEAD>Study Targets Video Display Terminal Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new federally funded study on 8,000 women
office workers aims to resolve persistent questions over whether
video display terminals can harm the health of people who use them.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., whose House Government Operations
subcommittee has held hearings on VDTs, said the two-year, $2
million study by Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York is long
overdue.
   Weiss said he had urged the U.S. Public Health Service for
several years to fund research ``that could determine whether VDTs
cause serious harm, especially for pregnant women who use them.''
   ``They have been terribly slow to respond, partly due to
encouragement by several large corporations to avoid this kind of
research,'' he said. ``Meanwhile, the potential harm has increased
dramatically as the number of VDT users has multiplied.''
   Weiss calls the Mount Sinai epidemiological study _ being funded
by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a
unit of the National Institutes of Health _ ``an important first
step'' toward resolving the health issue.
   The study comes in the wake of a report issued last month by the
congressional Office of Technology Assessment, saying more research
is needed to explore the potential health risks of power frequency
electromagnetic fields _ particularly their effects on the nervous
system and possible role in promoting cancer.
   The OTA report said that while most public concern has focused
on high-voltage transmission lines, more attention should be paid
to exposure to such fields from other sources such as household and
office wiring, appliances and other electrical equipment, including
VDTs.
   ``It is now clear that 60 Hz (cycles per second) and other low
frequency electromagnetic fields can interact with individual cells
and organs to produce biological changes,'' it said. ``The nature
of these interactions is subtle and complex. The implications of
these interactions for public health remain unclear, but there are
legitimate reasons for concern.''
   Michele Marcus, the Mount Sinai study's principal investigator,
said it will be conducted in four cities _ New York, Boston,
Cleveland and an as yet undetermined city in California. Both union
and non-union workplaces will be included.
   Dr. Marcus said a major difference between the Mount Sinai
project and previous epidemiological studies in this country is
that in addition to gathering health-history data through
questionnaires, ``we are going to be looking at reproductive
effects prospectively. That is, we're going to be following women
forward in time.''
   ``We'll be identifying their exposure or their use of video
display terminals, and then seeing whether or not they get pregnant
and following the course of the pregnancy,'' she said.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on science, technology and space, said ``there are
still many unanswered questions about the potential health effects
of VDTs and of electromagnetic fields generally, but there is no
longer any doubt that this form of radiation can cause some
biochemical changes.''
   ``The decision by NIH to support Mount Sinai's study is an
important step, but more is needed,'' Gore said. ``Government must
expand its research program and do more to ensure that private
industry is preparing solutions should the evidence warrant it.''
   Also welcoming the study was Rep. Joseph M. Gaydos, D-Pa.,
chairman of the House Education and Labor subcommittee on health
and safety, which plans to hold further hearings on the VDT issue
early next year.
   ``I am concerned about the health hazards faced by office
workers, especially those who use video display terminals for long
periods of time during the working day,'' Gaydos said.

<TEXT>
   Americans by nearly a 2-1 margin are inclined to
oppose anti-abortion candidates for their state legislatures and to
support legal abortion in their states, a national poll has found.
   As lawmakers across the country prepare to take up new abortion
laws, 38 percent of respondents to the Media General-Associated
Press poll said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate
who firmly opposes abortion.
   The same number said abortion wouldn't matter much in their
vote, while the smallest group _ about two in 10 _ said they would
be more apt to vote for a candidate who took a strong anti-abortion
position.
   Moreover, 63 percent of the 1,163 adults polled said they would
want abortion to be legal in their state if the U.S. Supreme Court
reversed its 1973 ruling that made abortion a constitutional right
and let each state make its own abortion laws.
   That support for legal abortion was up slightly from 57 percent
in an MG-AP poll in March. Similarly, support for the 1973 ruling
in the Roe vs. Wade case was up to 59 percent, from 53 percent.
   While those increases were within the poll's margin of error,
similar movement in several questions indicated a slight rise in
pro-choice opinion since the high court decision July 3 that
permitted states to increase restrictions on abortion.
   The new survey, conducted July 7-16, had a margin of error of
plus or minus three percentage points.
   While most respondents expressed general support for legal
abortion, they were split on specific restrictions permitted in the
recent Supreme Court ruling. Among those findings:
   _Sixty-five percent said abortions at public hospitals should be
legal, but that fell to 51 percent when respondents were asked
specifically about abortions that are not required to save the
mother's life. The Supreme Court said states can ban such abortions
from public hospitals.
   _Respondents split about evenly on whether it should be legal
for public health employees to perform or assist in abortions. The
court said that, too, can be barred by the states when the mother's
life is not at risk.
   _Respondents strongly supported mandatory pre-abortion tests to
see if fetuses that are at least 20 weeks old can survive outside
the womb, with 62 percent in favor. The high court said such tests
can be required.
   _By 54-38 percent, with 8 percent undecided, respondents said it
should be legal to use public funds to counsel women about the
availability of abortion. The court left that issue undecided.
   Overall, 48 percent said they opposed the July 3 ruling, 43
percent favored it and 9 percent were unsure. That was a split in
opinion given the margin of error.
   As in previous polls, general questions on abortion produced
divided views, reflecting public discomfort with an issue that pits
the rights of pregnant women with concern for their fetuses.
   Sixty-seven percent said a woman should be allowed to have an
abortion if she wants one and her doctor agrees to it; 25 percent
said not, and 8 percent were undecided. On the other hand, 42
percent said they would support a constitutional amendment to ban
most abortions. Fifty-three percent opposed such an amendment and
the rest were undecided.
   Younger, more educated and wealthier people were more apt to
support legal abortion, as were residents of the Northeast and the
West and big-city dwellers. People who called themselves
conservatives were far more likely to oppose abortion: Just 42
percent of conservatives supported the 1973 ruling, compared with
66 percent of moderates and 80 percent of liberals.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews July 7-16 with 1,163 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that 19
of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups; it is five points for people who
called themselves conservatives, for example.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to
it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not? Yes: 67
percent. No: 25 percent. Don't know or no answer: 8 percent.
   2. Would you vote for or against a candidate just on the basis
of that candidate's position on the abortion issue? Yes: 32. No:
61. DK-NA: 7.
   3. If a candidate for your state legislature is firmly opposed
to abortion, would that make you more likely to vote for that
candidate, or less likely, or wouldn't it matter much? More: 21.
Less: 38. Wouldn't matter: 38. DK-NA: 3.
   4a. Should it be legal or illegal for abortions to be done at
public hospitals? Legal: 65. Illegal: 26. DK-NA: 9.
   b. (If legal) Does that include abortions that are not necessary
to save the mother's life? Yes: 78. No: 18. DK-NA: 4.
   5a. Should it be legal or illegal or public health employees to
perform or assist in abortions? Legal: 44. Illegal: 43. DK-NA: 13.
   b. (If legal) Does that include abortions that are not necessary
to save the mother's life? Yes: 90. No: 9. DK-NA: 2.
   6. Should it be legal or illegal to use public funds to counsel
women about the availability of abortion? Legal: 54. Illegal: 38.
DK-NA: 8.
   7. If a woman who is at least 20 weeks pregnant wants an
abortion, should the doctor first be required to determine whether
the fetus can survive outside the womb, or not? Yes: 62. No: 21.
DK-NA: 17.
   8a. The U.S. Supreme Court this month gave the states more power
to restrict abortions. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor:
43. Oppose 48. DK-NA: 9.
   b. (If oppose) Is that because you wanted the court to do more
to restrict abortions, or because you think the court did too much
to restrict abortions? Wanted more: 8. Too much: 86. DK-NA: 7.
   9. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that a woman can have an
abortion if she wants one at any time during the first three months
of pregnancy. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor: 59.
Oppose: 36. DK-NA: 5.
   10. If the Supreme Court reversed its 1973 ruling and let each
state make its own abortion laws, abortion could become legal in
some states and illegal in others. Would you want abortion to be
legal or illegal in your state? Legal: 63. Illegal: 31. DK-NA: 7.
   11. If abortion was illegal in your state, do you think that
would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or
would most of them go to another state where it was legal? Stop: 7.
Go: 87. DK-NA: 6.
   12. Would you favor or oppose a constitutional amendment that
would make abortions illegal nationwide, except in cases of rape,
incest or to save the life of the mother? Favor: 42. Oppose: 53.
DK-NA: 6.

   When it comes to teaching medical
students about mental illness, Don Fidler doesn't go by the book.
He makes movies.
   ``A lot of the videotapes I make are designed to make people
feel like they really are in the patient's shoes,'' said Fidler, an
adolescent psychiatrist at Chestnut Ridge Hospital and an associate
professor of psychiatry at West Virginia University.
   ``Like, what does it feel like to be psychotic. The audience
gets confused. They really begin to take on some of the feelings
that are being portrayed.''
   Fidler, 40, has produced more than 100 features since he began
using videotapes as a teaching tool a decade ago while at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   About half are for sale to medical schools throughout the
country. The videos range from 8 minutes to two hours in length and
cost from $50 to $1,200.
   A year and a half ago, Fidler began working on a new educational
series called ``Medicine Playhouse'' at West Virginia. Each episode
presents an emotional, medical or philosophical problem typically
faced by health professionals.
   A question-and-answer session with an expert in the field is
held after each show.
   ``It's sort of a Lake Wobegone approach to medical education,''
Fidler said, referring to the mythical place made famous by
humorist Garrison Keillor on his radio show, ``A Prairie Home
Companion.''
   Students say the videos are a good learning tool.
   ``It's much more helpful for a medical student to observe a
patient,'' said Kellie Gooding, 24, a third-year student at the
medical school.
   ``It stays in your mind much longer if you can actually see a
schizophrenic or whatever, rather than just reading about it. You
might just remember something a couple of days if you read it. If
you see it on the screen, you might remember it for the rest of
your life.''
   ``The videos show a really comprehensive picture,'' said Sloane
Blair, 23, also a third-year student. ``It shows you as it is _
real people in real life. In a book, they would break a subject
down into one component and then another.''
   Some of the videotapes, Fidler said, make medical students
squirm.
   In one video, shot in black-and-white and titled simply,
``Depression,'' a loud clock ticks in the background as cameras
close in from different angles on the troubled face of an actor.
   ``It's just 15 minutes long but it seems like it runs for an
eternity,'' Fidler said. ``I've had people actually come up and
tell me they feel suicidal after watching it, even though the word
is never mentioned.''
   In another, called ``Paranoia,'' a man grows more and more
anxious as passengers riding on a city bus turn around in their
seats and begin staring at him.
   He admits his videos may not be right for everyone.
   ``About 10 or 15 percent of the students don't learn well using
the videotapes,'' Fidler said. ``They'd be better off with books or
a lecture. Some people just aren't good visual learners.
   ``But that's OK. I don't think many lectures in medical school
reach 85 percent of the students,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Considers Duty on Imports of Canadian Pork</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prospective U.S. levy on imports of
unprocessed fresh, chilled and frozen pork from Canada could add
further to a growing number of live hogs coming across the border,
according to an Agriculture Department analysis.
   Last week the Commerce Department ruled in a ``final
determination'' that Canada's pork is being subsidized. The ruling
now goes to the U.S. International Trade Commission, which has 45
days to decide whether the imports are hurting American hog farmers.
   If the commission agrees with the Commerce ruling, the Bureau of
Customs will be ordered to collect countervailing duties on imports
of Canadian pork to offset the benefits of the subsidies.
   The Commerce investigation did not include processed or
preserved pork products such as canned hams, bacon, sausage or
ground pork. Countervailing duties have been levied on imports of
live hogs from Canada the past four years.
   Overall, the United States is the world's largest pork importer,
with about 1.14 billion pounds, carcass weight equivalent, imported
last year, approximately 7 percent of U.S. consumption, according
to the department's Economic Research Service.
   Canada supplied almost 45 percent of the 1988 pork imports;
Denmark, 29 percent; and Poland, 11 percent. The remainder comes
mainly from other Eastern European countries.
   Pork imports during the first four months of this year totaled
about 333 million pounds, down 17 percent from January-April 1988,
the report said. Imports from Canada and Denmark were
``substantially below'' the year-earlier level, while shipments
from Eastern Europe were up slightly.
   ``Canadian hog and pork prices remain below last year, which has
encouraged domestic consumption and diverted some supply from the
export market,'' the report said. ``Despite near-record year-ago
hog slaughter, Canadian statistics indicate that total exports of
pork through the end of May were about 8 percent below 1988
levels.''
   Earlier this year there was a wide spread between western
Canadian hog prices and U.S. prices, the report said. That provided
a strong incentive for western Canadian producers to ship live hogs
to the U.S. market.
   The spread narrowed in April, and imports of live hogs from
Canada declined to less than half of their March level _ but still
were 18 percent more than a year earlier.
   Hog imports from all sources for the January-April period
totaled 475,845 head, the report said. That was 125 percent above
the same period in 1988.
   Canadian production this year is expected to be down about 2
percent from 1988 because of herd liquidations prompted by lower
hog prices.
   ``The addition of a countervailing duty deposit on fresh,
chilled and frozen pork imports from Canada is expected to
reinforce the existing shift towards imports of Canadian hogs,''
the report said.
   Shayle D. Shagam, an economist in the USDA agency, said in
another report that the world pork trade is small relative to total
production and that a handful of countries are involved.
   China is the largest pork producer, accounting for almost a
third of the world's total last year, but the country's huge
population requires most of the production, Shagam said. Last year
China was the fourth largest pork exporter, with live hogs and pork
going to Hong Kong, and frozen pork to Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   On an individual country basis, the United States is the second
largest pork producer but ranks fourth when the 12-nation European
Economic Community and Eastern Europe are included.
   As well as being the leading pork importer, the United States is
sixth in the world as an exporter. Japan is the biggest market for
U.S. pork. Mexico is another large buyer.
   Canada ranks seventh in the world as a pork producer, turning
out much more than it requires domestically, Shagam said. Exports
currently are about 22 percent of Canada's production. Almost 90
percent goes to the United States and 9 percent to Japan. Canada
was third as an exporter last year.
   ``As a result of large domestic pork supplies, imports by the
United States will remain fairly steady, with Canada increasing its
relative share of the market,'' Shagam said.
   But Shagam added that the mix between hogs and pork from Canada
will depend on relative wage rates in the meatpacking industry and
U.S. countervailing duties on imports from there.

<HEAD>Colleges say Minority Recruiting Results Fall Short</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of colleges and
universities are trying to attract and retain more minority
students but few of their efforts are bearing fruit, says a new
report on ``Campus Trends, 1989.''
   Eight in 10 administrators responding to a survey by the
American Council on Education reported either ``a lot'' or ``some''
activity toward those goals on their campuses. But only one in four
said minority enrollment had increased in the 1988-89 school year.
   ``We obviously would rather see more progress,'' said Elaine
El-Khawas, an ACE vice president and author of the report. ``It's
encouraging that there's a tremendous level of activity. But the
actual results fall short.''
   ACE surveyed senior academic administrators at 366 colleges and
universities for its sixth annual campus trends report. Other
findings showed that faculty shortages and inadequate physical
facilities are pressing concerns on campus.
   Many of the questions on minorities were based on
recommendations from a recent ACE publication called ``Minorities
on Campus: A Handbook for Enhancing Diversity.''
   Only 25 percent of the administrators said their enrollment of
blacks, Hispanics and Asians had risen during 1988-89 and only 10
percent reported an increase in American Indian students.
   The same proportion of institutions reported they were making
special efforts to increase minority faculty members. But only 17
percent said they offer incentives to academic departments to hire
minorities and only 25 percent reported a net gain in minority
faculty over the previous year.
   While some studies have predicted overall faculty shortages in
the mid-1990s, El-Khawas said her survey found that the problem
already exists.
   Half of the administrators reported it is taking longer to find
qualified people for full-time faculty positions. Half also said
they are having greater difficulty getting top applicants to accept
positions when they are offered _ up from 25 percent in 1987.
   Specifically, four in 10 institutions reported problems finding
qualified full-time computer science professors. One in three cited
similar problems for business; mathematics and health professions
each were mentioned by one in four schools.
   ``The labor market for faculty is tightening right now,'' said
El-Khawas. ``The real dilemmas for colleges are going to be
starting much sooner than 1995.''
   El-Khawas attributed the problem to a number of factors, among
them an inadequate number of doctorate holders; an increasing
number of Ph.D.'s going into private industry; a greater proportion
of doctoral degrees earned by foreigners; accelerating retirement
of faculty members; and expanding student enrollment.
   More than 71 percent of the administrators in the survey
reported increased overall enrollment in the 1988-89 school year
and half said the size of their full-time faculty had grown. Half
also said they expect the pace of retirement among full-time
faculty to accelerate in the next few years.
   The result is bound to be a highly competitive situation,
El-Khawas said, with universities offering incentives to keep
people from retiring, higher salaries to people in certain fields,
and lures designed to attract professors from other universities.
Class size may also increase, she said.
   Other findings:
   _Only 32 percent of the administrators felt their physical plant
was excellent or very good. Another third said plant renovation and
renewal will be a significant problem in the next five years, and
more than half predicted their facilities will not be adequate to
last the next decade.
   _About half of the administrators said they believe assessments
of student learning, mandated in large part by states, will
``significantly improve'' undergraduate education. But 37 percent
said that so far, the process has resulted mainly in new reporting
requirements to the state.
   _Basic skills testing is in place at 65 percent of schools and
another 19 percent are planning such tests.
   _Half of the colleges and universities now assess writing and 27
percent report that writing assessment is in the planning stages.
   _Close to half of the schools plan to assess students' critical
thinking skills and 14 percent already do so.
   ACE is the umbrella group for the nation's colleges and
universities. Its campus trends survey was adjusted to reflect the
country's 2,500 general institutions of higher education.
Seminaries, art schools, stand-alone graduate schools and other
specialized institutions were not included. The margin of error for
the survey was 2 percent.

<HEAD>Bunker Says He's Trying to Forget Silver Thursday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Bunker Hunt says he's trying to forget
the spring of 1980, when his silver-buying binge crashed to an end
and began unraveling one of the world's greatest fortunes.
   He used to be in the oil business, in ranching and farming, he
told U.S. Tax Court Judge Jules G. Korner III. ``Lately, it's
hiring lawyers and defending lawsuits.''
   The Hunt brothers' tax case begins its third week today and is
expected to last about a month.
   Bunker Hunt is contesting $155 million in 1982 taxes the
Internal Revenue Services says are owed from the dissolution of a
partnership set up to pay off the brothers' debts.
   His brother William Herbert is contesting more than $158 million
in 1982 taxes, while younger brother Lamar, owner of the Kansas
City Chiefs football team, is contesting $505,377 in taxes.
   Bunker testified Friday, ``I don't go around trying to remember
what happened in the spring of 1980. It caused me tremendous
losses, it caused me tax problems.''
   Banks once eager to lend him money ``were trying to get their
arms around as much collateral as possible,'' he said _ to the
point of demanding ``pictures on the wall'' and even his brother's
Rolex watch.
   Hunt told the court he could not recall whether one document he
signed was five or 5,000 pages long or whether he signed a
promissory note for $272 million after Silver Thursday, the day in
late March 1980 when silver prices collapsed.
   Bunker and Herbert owned one-third of the world's supply of
silver bullion from a silver-shopping spree that began in 1973,
government attorneys claim.
   As the price tumbled to $10 an ounce from $50 an ounce, the
brothers found themselves with debts totaling as much as $2 billion
and creditors threatening the family's beloved Placid Oil Co.
   Bank creditors ``dictated'' the terms of the partnership with
Placid set up to repay the Hunt brothers' debts from their soured
silver investments, he said.
   ``The net effect was we didn't have control over our business.
That's why I'm sitting here in court, because of the structure the
banks put us in,'' Hunt said.
   Since then, Bunker, Herbert and Placid have filed for protection
from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court; Bunker and Herbert have
been accused of attempting to corner the silver market by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and a jury in New York last
year found Bunker, Herbert and two others had conspired to
manipulate and monopolize the silver market and defraud investors.
   Bunker, the first of the brothers to testify in the non-jury
trial, recalled one day after Silver Thursday when he signed
documents while surrounded by attorneys.
   ``I signed documents for three or four hours, just as fast as I
could,'' he said. ``There must have been thousands and thousands of
documents I signed, they would probably go to the ceiling of this
room here if they were stacked up end to end.''
   Bunker said he remembers Walter Fraker, Placid's vice president
and chief financial officer, telling him that the banks ``were
calling all the shots, it was pretty much their party'' as they set
up the partnership to repay the silver loans.

<TEXT>
   Like scouts in major league baseball, a
pair of House Democrats are looking for talent to keep their team
winning atop Capitol Hill.
   But figuring out which potential congressional candidates might
get a contract from the voters is a tricky task of balancing the
facts _ such as money _ with the intangibles, appearance and that
``hungry look.''
   Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, and Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., the
committee's recruiting chairman, met this weekend with potential
candidates in Rhode Island and New Hampshire _ the two targeted
congressional districts Democrats say they might take from the GOP.
   In 1988, Democrats in the House picked up seats despite the big
GOP win on the presidential level. ``We out-hustled and we
out-recruited the Republican Party in terms of candidates,'' said
Synar.
   On their first trip of the 1990 cycle, the Democrats' task
wasn't finding the potential candidates; it was looking for which
one was most likely to win.
   In Rhode Island, Anthony and Synar met with four Democrats
interested in trying to unseat freshman Rep. Ronald Machtley,
R-R.I., who beat longtime incumbent Democrat Fernand St Germain
after St Germain's personal finances became the subject of a
federal probe.
   They consider Machtley a fluke, and the national Democrats want
to mount a strong challenge in 1990.
   Party rules don't allow the national Democrats to take sides in
a primary, so they can't handpick their candidate. But they can
pressure the locals to unite behind a candidate.
   Scott Wolf, who nearly beat St Germain in the primary last year,
told Anthony and Synar he was in the race. State Reps. Rene
Lafayette and Jeff Teitz said they also were lookin, as did Rhode
Island Secretary of State Kathleen Connell.
   In separate meetings with each, Anthony and Synar tried to learn
about the public skills and personal drive of the candidate:
   ``What would get you into it?''
   ``How much money can you raise by the end of the year?''
   ``What do you think of (other Democratic candidate)''
   They ask about local issues and how the national party can help,
and dole out advice.
   ``You realize the easiest way to clear the field is to have the
money,'' Synar tells one. And eventually, he warns, that may
involve something like mortgaging one's home to stay in the race.
   The two congressmen repeated the process in Manchester, in New
Hampshire's first congressional district. There, incumbent
Republican Bob Smith has announced for the Senate and Democrats say
they've got a good shot.
   ``We'd love to have a toehold up here,'' said Anthony. New
Hampshire is the only New England state with no Democrats in the
House or Senate.
   Again, the Democrats would like to avoid a costly and divisive
primary but it appears one is down the road.
   Conservative Democrat Bob Stephen, a state senator and
Manchester restaurateur, has already formed an exploratory campaign
committee. Joe Keefe, an attorney and moderate who lost to Smith
last year, says he's in it, too.
   And two others are looking, former state party chairman George
Bruno and stockbroker and party activist Jim Demers, who ran in
1986.
   ``If all of us go at it ... I don't think the seat is
winnable,'' warns Bruno, urging the national officials to do what
they can to help avoid a primary.

   Every working day, Alexander S.
Kutlakhmetov boards an orange bus with six shoulder-high wheels
that carries him and other miners 43 miles across the rolling
Siberian plateau to the Taldinski Severni Open Pit Mine.
   On Friday, Kutlakhmetov, known as Sasha, boarded the bus for the
first time in more than a week. He sped off to explain to other
miners the details of a 35-point agreement that ended the first
Soviet industrial strike in 60 years.
   Lurching along the bumpy, thinly asphalted road that links city
and mine, the bus passed birch, aspen and pine forests, tiny
settlements of log cabins with carved wooden trims and kitchen
gardens. Small herds of goats and cows, and an occasional horse,
could be seen in the lanes.
   As the sun rose slowly, burning off a thick morning mist, the
bus arrived at the pit's brick headquarters, and the miners began
to slap each other's shoulders in greeting and discuss the
agreement that ended their unprecedented strike.
   Sasha stepped up to the landing and, waving the agreement, began
to explain.
   ``Do we get three years maternity leave?'' shouted one woman,
who worked in the mine offices.
   ``That's in there,'' replied Sasha.
   ``What about the time it takes us to get here on the bus?''
shouted a man.
   ``We'll get paid from the time we check in, but not for
commuting,'' said Sasha.
   The session continued for a half hour, as miners asked about
grievances that were advanced at Taldinski Severni but may or may
not have been included in the demands of the strike committee
formed the week before for the Kuznetsk Coal Basin, the country's
second largest coal-producing region.
   At last, the workers were satisfied that if they had not won
every point, they had at least seized the right to strike, a right
not guaranteed by Soviet law. They beamed with new-found confidence.
   ``It's a victory over the system that we've had in the Soviet
Union for the past 70 years, a system in which we work hard but get
little in return,'' said Pyotr A. Menayev, an engineer.
   Another miner, Viktor N. Sizikov, agreed that it was a victory,
but ``it would have been a bigger victory if we had continued the
strike.''
   Sensitive to the doubts of miners like Sizikov, the regional
strike committee renamed itself the Workers' Committee and remained
in session to pressure authorities to keep the bargain.
   ``If they don't, we go back on strike. That's in the
agreement,'' said Kutlakhmetov.
   Mine managers, who backed most of the strike demands, were
pleased at the most import government concession _ allowing mines
to form local assocations that will have a greater say in running
the industry, which remains under the general control of the Coal
Mining Ministry.
   ``It is better to be master in your own house,'' said Viktor G.
Shevnin, the main production engineer at the mine. ``The strike
will improve our lives. And the agreement will move us closer to
real economic independence.''
   The miners, still skeptical of the government's intention of
keeping the deal, boarded the bus once again to drive the final few
miles to the pit.
   Deep down in the crater, Valery E. Demski clambered into the
cabin of a giant crane and began using the controls to scoop small
mountains of coal into oversize dump trucks, resuming delivery of
fuel to the state.
   ``We got little concrete,'' said Demski, as he operated the
shovel. ``Maybe there will be more.''
   Another worker in the crane cabin, Yuri V. Gorlov, nodded his
head, and said, ``It was right to strike.''

   More than 80 of the dead in the 19-month
uprising against Israeli rule are Palestinians killed by their own
people, and Arab against Arab violence is growing as the revolt
drags on without a political resolution.
   Why are Palestinians killing Palestinians?
   Most of those killed were accused of being informers or
otherwise collaborating with Israel. But some Palestinian sources
say political battles over the direction of the ``intefadeh,'' or
uprising, have turned violent and bred threats, car burnings and
even murder.
   Israeli officials claim the slayings support their position that
the PLO fosters terrorism. But Palestinian sources say at least
some of the violence is by radicals challenging PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's calls for restraint.
   For whatever reason, the tempo has accelerated. From the start
of the uprising in December 1987 to the end of last year, 22
Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs. So far this year, at
least 61 have been slain.
   In addition to those slayings, the deaths of at least 518
Palestinians have been attributed to Israeli soldiers or civilians.
Thirty-eight Israelis have also been killed.
   The uprising, aimed at ending Israel's 22-year occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, has employed brute force against
uncooperative Palestinians from its first days, even as clashes
raged between the territories' residents and the Israeli army.
   Those who challenged the uprising's efforts to break ties with
Israel were threatened, beaten and sometimes had their cars or
houses set ablaze.
   Often the political message was clear.
   After the PLO-backed leaders of the uprising called for
Palestinians to stop working as police for the military government,
a Arab policeman was stabbed to death in Jericho.
   His body, wrapped in a Palestinian flag, was dumped on his
mother's doorstep. Shortly thereafter, several hundred Arab
policemen quit their jobs.
   Hassan Tawil, appointed mayor of the West Bank town of El-Bireh
by Israel after it deposed the elected mayor, has survived a
stabbing attack. His house was set afire during the uprising. He
now employs bodyguards.
   The motives for some murders seem religious or moral, especially
in attacks by the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, a
non-PLO group that has targeted drug dealers and prostitutes.
   In other cases, motives have been cloudy _ Palestinians say a
victim was a collaborator, while army officials saying he was
killed in criminal or family feuds. Palestinians say some of those
slain were simply thugs who sold their services to anyone,
including Israel.
   While Palestinians have maintained the targets were those who
thwarted the revolt for selfish reasons, some actions have had
political purposes.
   Arafat issued a public death threat to Mayor Elias Freij of
Bethlehem after Freij suggested suspending the uprising as a signal
to encourage Israeli compromise.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, masked men have twice visited
and threatened local Palestinians who met Israeli officials to
discuss the Israeli proposal for elections in the occupied
territories as a step toward peace.
   However, the PLO announced recently from its headquarters in
Tunis that it approved of the meetings and was getting reports from
Palestinians who were taking part.
   Signs of disunity surfaced in May with arson attacks on cars of
well-known PLO supporters in Ramallah and Nablus and the murder of
a village leader of Arafat's Fatah PLO faction at Yaabed in the
West Bank.
   PLO supporters deny that rifts among Palestinians have exploded
into violence, blaming the trouble on collaborators or attempts by
Israel to foster disunity.
   One well-placed source, speaking privately, derided PLO claims
that the internal debate was not turning violent. He said both the
recent car burnings and the slaying of the Fatah leader in Yaabed
village were evidence of a split in Arafat's own faction.
   The victim, he said, was a PLO treasurer who rejected a Fatah
rebel's demand for money to escalate the revolt. Two days later,
the treasurer was found slain outside the village mosque.
   The source said the split over tactics reflected both
differences among PLO officials abroad and resentment by PLO
leaders in the villages and refugee camps that have been the real
battleground of the uprising.
   He said many local leaders spent years in prison for
anti-Israeli activities but see the real power for guiding the
uprising still held by traditional ruling Palestinian families in
Arab east Jerusalem.
   Israeli officials have pointed to the dissent and violence among
Palestinians as evidence that Arafat is using murder as a weapon to
rein in those who would be willing to cast off PLO leadership and
accept Israel's peace initiative.
   Palestinians deny this charge. They note that Israel has failed
to produce one specific case of this type of political murder.

<HEAD>AIDS Cases In United States Pass 100,000 Mark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of AIDS cases in the United States
has hit the 100,000 mark.
   The report for the 100,000th recorded case some time in recent
weeks became part of the data files at Centers for Disease
Controls, where the cumulative number of U.S. AIDS cases is
tabulated.
   When the monthly total for July is released in late August, CDC
experts are sure that America's official count of total AIDS cases
will for the first time officially pass 100,000.
   Many experts have admitted that the AIDS case total is more of a
rough estimate than a precise count, but the official total
emphasizes that the dreadful statistical march of AIDS has not
retreated or slowed.
   By 1992, the CDC expects there will be a cumulative total of
365,000 confirmed cases of AIDS. The agency also predicts that
within three years the total number of U.S. residents killed by
AIDS will reach 263,000.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that destroys immune cells and
renders the body unable to resist disease.

<NOTE>Federal Drug Convictions Jump 161.4 Percent Between 1980 And 1987</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says drug convictions
jumped 161.4 percent between 1980 and 1987, paced by a 48.7 percent
increase in defendants found guilty of federal crimes.
   Results of a study released Sunday showed that by 1987 a larger
proportion of convicted defendants received prison terms from
federal judges and their sentences were on average 11 months longer
than those imposed in 1980, the department said.
   The number of criminal defendants convicted in federal courts
nationwide increased from 29,943 in 1980 to 44,518 percent in 1987,
according to the study prepared by the Justice Department's Bureau
of Justice Statistics.
   The conviction rate for defendants prosecuted in federal courts
increased from 76 percent in 1980 to 81 percent in 1987, the study
said.
   The figures demonstrated the need for more money to build
additional prisons to house the increasing numbers of convicted
defendants sent behind bars by federal judges, Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.
   President Bush has proposed spending $1.5 billion to add 24,000
beds to the overcrowded federal prison system.

<NOTE>Plan Would Offer Health Care for All, Set National Spending Cap</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the House Select Committee on
Aging today was to propose an overhaul of the government's health
care system that would offer coverage to all Americans and limit
overall spending for medical care.
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., said Sunday the measure would
provide medical coverage to the 37 million Americans who currently
are uninsured and improve benefits for the 200 million people, or
85 percent of Americans, who are underinsured against catastrophic
long-term illness.
   In addition, the legislation for the first time would set a cap
on the nation's total spending for health care, limiting
expenditures to 12 percent of the gross national product, the
broadest measure of U.S. economic activity.
   Roybal's plan is among many that have been proposed to establish
a comprehensive health care program for the nation that would
better protect uninsured and underinsured Americans.
   From 1980 through 1987, health care costs rose at an average
rate of 10.4 percent, or 3.3 percent faster than the GNP. Under the
current system, these costs are expected to reach 13 percent of GNP
by 1995 and nearly 15 percent by the year 2000.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key barometer rose and
the dollar fell against the Japanese yen Monday despite news that
Prime Minister Sousuke Uno will resign.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, which gained 234.56
points last Friday, added 193.90 points or 0.69 percent, to finish
at 34,093.33.
   The dollar started at 143.25 yen, up 1.10 yen from last Friday's
142.15 yen close, but fell steadily, ending the day at 141.95 yen.
   On the stock market, ``it appears that the market shrugged off
the election results,'' said Curtis King, a trader with Nomura
Securities.
   In an election for half the seats of Japan's upper house of
Parliament Sunday, the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party lost
its majority for the first time in 34 years. Uno announced he will
resign to take responsibility for the defeat.
   Interest-sensitive issues were bought during the day because
traders believed interest rates in the United States might rise
higher than they had expected, King said.
   ``At about 10:10 a.m. the news about Uno resigning triggered the
market to begin taking profits,'' he said.
   The market got sluggish afterward, although housing-related
issues picked up, King said.

<HEAD>Mexico, Creditors Agree on Debt-Reduction Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico and its creditor banks finally agree on
the key points of a debt-reduction package, providing the first
victory for the Bush administration's effort to ease the $1.3
trillion Third World debt burden.
   The agreement announced late Sunday night ended two days of
intense talks at the U.S. Treasury Department where Mexican
officials and U.S. bankers were joined by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   In the final package, negotiators representing the commercial
banks agreed to choose from three options for providing assistance.
They can cut the principal on the old loans by 35 percent, reduce
the interest rate they are charging to 6.25 percent or provide new
loans to Mexico.
   U.S. officials predicted that the debt-relief package could
slash by up to one-third the $4.5 billion Mexico is paying annually
to service the $54 billion it owes to commercial banks.
   However, officials said the exact amount of debt relief will not
be known for some time because each of Mexico's creditor banks must
decide on its own the extent to which it will participate in the
plan.
   Still, the agreement signified the first tangible result for the
Bush administration's debt-reduction plan, which was unveiled by
Brady on March 10. The strategy seeks to provide various incentives
for commercial banks to voluntarily reduce the amount of Third
World debt they hold.
   Brady, who had lobbied intensely for the final agreement, hailed
the package as ``a major step forward in the implementation'' of
the debt-reduction effort.
   The administration had made Mexico the test-case for the Brady
plan, believing that an agreement with the developing world's
second-largest debtor would establish precedents for deals with
other countries.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari went on nationwide
television Sunday night to praise the final package, saying,
``Mexico has opened the way for other nations with similar
problems.''
   Salinas said the debt reduction plan answered ``the cry of
Mexicans to return to growth'' but he cautioned Mexican citizens,
``don't look for spectacular results overnight.''
   The Bush administration had hoped to have a completed Mexican
debt plan to present to the seven-nation economic summit last week
in Paris. But even without a deal, the final summit communique
included a strong endorsement of the approach.
   In an effort to break the stalemate, Brady brought the
negotiators to Washington on Saturday and Sunday to resolve the
remaining issues.
   Salinas described the final talks as ``difficult, complex and
tense.'' Mexico had begun the discussions demanding that the banks
cut Mexico's debt by 55 percent.
   Others participating in the final round of negotiations were
Mexican Finance Minister Pedro Aspe and John Reed, chairman of
Citicorp and head of the 15-bank committee which bargains for the
hundreds of banks to which Mexico owes money.
   In a joint statement from the Mexican government and the banks,
the two sides said they had reached agreement on the main points of
the financing package with the expectation that it would be
accepted by ``Mexico's approximately 500 creditor banks worldwide.''
   The debt reduction options include slashing the principal on old
loans by 35 percent or reducing the interest rate banks receive to
6.25 percent.
   Banks taking either of these options would be able to get
guarantees against default on the remaining debt from the
151-nation International Monetary Fund or its sister organization,
the World Bank.
   The joint statement estimated that $7 billion will be available
from the international lending organizations and other sources,
including Japan, to support the debt-reduction and interest-rate
reduction efforts for Mexico.
   In conjunction with the Mexican agreement, Brady said the United
States is willing to provide up to $2 billion in short-term
financing to Mexico to tide the country over until the new loans
begin arriving later this year. He said other countries would help
in providing this bridge loan.
   Officials said one of the final issues resolved Sunday night
involved a ``readjustment clause'' that would increase debt
payments once the Mexican economy rebounds.
   One official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used,
said both sides agreed to tie increased debt payments to any
improvements in Mexico's export sales after the year 1996.
   According to the joint statement, Mexico also agreed to provide
opportunities for the banks to exchange about $1 billion of debt
annually for ownership of factories and other direct investments in
Mexico, under a process known as a debt-for-equity swap.
   The $54 billion owed to private banks represents about half of
Mexico's $107 billion foreign debt, the second largest in the
developing world after Brazil's.

<HEAD>Mecham Still Looms Large on Arizona Political Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a year after former Gov. Evan Mecham
was driven from office in disgrace, he casts a shadow over Arizona
politics as he campaigns to regain his old job.
   Mecham's conservative ideas dominate the Republican agenda and
his successor, Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, has been unable to
marshal support in her own party or win battles with the GOP
majority in the Legislature.
   Mecham was elected in 1986 in a three-way race; he got just 40
percent of the vote. That inspired a law requiring the governor to
receive at least 50 percent of the vote.
   Some Mecham supporters admit he would have trouble winning a
clear majority. But they say he may have enough solid support to
overcome any moderate Republican opponent in the primary.
   That leaves many Republicans in a quandary. What they'd really
like, said freshman state Sen. Jerry Gillespie, is ``somebody with
Mecham's philosophy but not his cantankerousness, at least as he's
been portrayed.''
   Mecham, whose only opponent so far is millionaire developer J.
Fife Symington III, exudes confidence about the September 1990
primary, and the general election that follows.
   ``I'm going to win the cotton-picking election,'' he said. ``You
can mark that on the wall if you wish.''
   The blunt-talking, 65-year-old auto dealer with four failed
gubernatorial campaigns behind him stunned Arizona Republicans with
his 1986 victory.
   From the start, he demonstrated a remarkable ability to offend
many groups. In his first month in office, he rescinded the state's
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, questioning the civil rights
leader's stature and saying that former Gov. Bruce Babbitt had
lacked the authority to decree the holiday.
   Mecham also endorsed a book that characterized blacks as
``pickaninnies,'' stated that a political enemy was spying on him
with laser beams, and was reported to have associates with criminal
records.
   He was impeached in February 1988 on charges of misusing a state
protocol fund, obstructing a probe into a death threat and
concealing a developer's $350,000 campaign loan.
   The Senate convicted and ousted him two months later on the
first two charges before voters could make their own decision in a
recall election that had been scheduled for May. The Senate dropped
the loan concealment charge, and a jury subsequently acquitted him
of wrongdoing.
   Mecham earlier this month challenged his impeachment and
demanded the reinstatement of $570,000 in expenses.
   Mecham was succeeded by Mrs. Mofford, who since 1975 had been
secretary of state, a largely ceremonial, elected post similar to
the lieutenant governor in other states.
   Mrs. Mofford enjoyed popularity and bipartisan support early on,
but she failed to get her way on several key issues during the
legislative session that ended in June.
   Moderate Republicans sided with conservatives in opposing
Mofford initiatives to increase taxes and spending, instead cutting
the state's contribution to government pension funds.
   Mecham has advocated slashing taxes and state spending.
   The Legislature also defeated Mrs. Mofford's bid to restore the
King holiday.
   ``Rose basically is still trying to find her sea legs,'' said
state Rep. Peter Goudinoff, a University of Arizona political
science professor.
   Mrs. Mofford, 67, said she will run for re-election, although
aides say she hasn't yet begun fundraising. No other Democratic
candidate has announced.
   The perfect candidate, Gillespie said, would combine Mecham's
conservatism with Mofford's geniality.
   Some sense the impeachment is unfinished business for many
Arizonans.
   ``I think Arizona needs to vote on the Mecham situation,'' said
Rep. Leslie Johnson, who cast one of the few votes against
impeachment last year. Still, she added, ``We cannot allow any one
person to be the issue of the campaign.''

   The agreement with foreign banks to reduce
Mexico's debt burden will give Mexico both more cash for investment
and an important psychological boost after years of austerity and
stagnation.
   ``The resources that were being sent outside the country can now
be channeled into investment, growth and creating jobs,'' President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in a triumphant televised address
Sunday night.
   Mexico's total debt burden is estimated at $107 billion _ with
$54 billion owed to private banks _ and the agreement is expected
to cut billions from the amount Mexico has to pay to service its
debt to the banks.
   Mexico got into trouble during the oil boom, when developing
nations and banks thought the price of oil would keep going up.
   When the price crashed in 1982, Mexico was suddenly left without
enough money to make payments on the billions it had borrowed.
   The result was six years of belt-tightening under the
administration of President Miguel de la Madrid.
   The government had to take harsh measures to get the money to
make payments and that left little for development. Private
companies, too, couldn't borrow money to invest in new plants or
equipment.
   Mexico's economy slowed down and inflation went up _ to over 150
percent annually some years. The peso dropped like a brick against
the dollar from eight to the dollar in the mid-1970s to 2,500 to
the dollar today.
   The average Mexican paycheck lost about half its buying power.
The austerity affected everything from the peso to pollution _ 95
percent of all cars in Mexico City are more than five years old,
most bought before the crash.
   ``Every day we worked harder but we were worse off,'' Salinas
said.
   The country of 85 million was under additional social pressure
because of demographics. One million young people were entering the
job market every year, but the country had trouble creating even
half that many jobs.
   The pressure was also visible in the erosion of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party's power in last year's
presidential election. Salinas won with barely 50 percent of the
vote, the lowest margin in the history of a party that has given
Mexico 60 years of stable government.
   Some of the pressure was relieved by emigration, which continues
as one of many factors that gives the United States an interest in
its southern neighbor's stability.
   Mexico was able to argue that it deserved consideration from the
banks because it had done everything asked by creditors and had
worked hard to restructure its economy.
   It joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and stopped
protecting its economy from foreign competition. The idea, which
has been working, was to reduce prices in Mexico and make Mexican
industry more competitive on international markets.
   Salinas was careful to get President Bush, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and institutions such as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund on board before tackling the private
banks that were reluctant to write off billions in debt.
   He also made dramatic crackdowns on corruption and the drug
trafficking that had infuriated the United States.
   In his speech, Salinas said that some of the money saved under
the new agreement will go to building infrastructure _ roads, dams,
communications _ that he hopes will lay the basis for an eventual
growth rate of 6 percent a year.
   Economists say part of what Mexico gains will go to buying back
debt at a discount. The rest can be used for investment in
infrastructure that could prime the pump for the private sector.
   With fewer payments to make the government will need to borrow
less money, putting less pressure on domestic credit markets and
making more available for the private sector at lower rates.
   More importantly, Salinas hopes increased confidence and the
perception of victory will attract foreign investment and help
bring back billions invested abroad by wealthy Mexicans.
   Nevertheless, Salinas warned his countrymen, economic recovery
will not come overnight.
   ``The agreement does not mean that by some magic trick our
problems will cease to exist,'' he said. He promised firm guidance
of the economy and honest management of the nation's resources.
   ``Everybody must continue pushing productivity and maintaining
order,'' Salinas said.

   When Sousuke Uno became prime minister on June 2,
he was widely expected to be a caretaker who with luck might serve
until October while his scandal-plagued party put together a
political reform package.
   His luck turned out to be very bad.
   Now he will go down in Japanese postwar history as rivaling for
shortness the two-month tenure that Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi
had from December 1956 to February 1957.
   Seldom has a respectable political career crumbled as fast as
Uno's. He was in office less than a week when a weekly newsmagazine
published a former geisha's allegation that he had paid her to be
his mistress.
   Publishing the story broke a taboo about revealing details of
politicians' private affairs. The 66-year-old Uno, who is married,
was deeply embarrassed facing opposition questions in parliament as
to whether he was suitable to represent Japan abroad when his
ex-mistress had complained in print about the way he had treated
her.
   It was about the last thing Uno might have expected to happen to
him.
   Elders in his Liberal Democratic Party selected him to be prime
minister because his experience as foreign minister would stand
Japan in good diplomatic stead. He was clean of the bribery scandal
that ruled out all the prime ministerial contenders in the party,
and otherwise uncontroversial.
   But allegations against Uno widened, with publications finding
other women who claimed sexual relations with him. On June 28,
Japanese papers reported that Uno had asked party leaders to let
him resign because of the embarrassment.
   ``I didn't become prime minister because I wanted to,'' Uno was
quoted as saying.
   But he was persuaded to stay on. He attended the summit of the
world's seven leading industrial democracies in Paris in mid-July
and led the Liberal Democrats into what became their worst
electoral defeat in three decades in Sunday's voting for half the
seats in the upper house of Parliament.
   Uno's ``woman problem,'' as Japanese media dubbed his personal
scandal, was one of many the Liberal Democrats faced in the
election campaign. They were distrusted because of the bribery
scandal, disliked because of a new sales tax imposed in April,
suspected because market-liberalization measures were seen
threatening the livelihoods of farmers.
   This morning, Uno was calm as he faced reporters and said he
would leave office as soon as the party could replace him.
   ``Ultimate responsibility'' for the election defeat was his, he
said, and he hoped the party would choose a new head ``promptly.''
   If that process, as expected, takes three or four weeks, Uno
will not go down in history as beating Ishibashi's record for a
short tenure. But it will be a close call.

<HEAD>Lacroix Still Signs Clothes with Fun, Fantasy and Luxury</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix, maintaining his reputation as a
young creator, brought out a collection of fun, fantasy, lace and
furs on the first day of haute couture showings for next winter.
   As Paris sweltered under a rare heatwave, top couturiers on
Sunday unveiled their luxurious, befurred and feathered models for
cooler weather.
   Lacroix's pouf skirt finally ran out of steam. But he's kept a
taste for beautiful, opulent fabrics and top-heavy outfits full of
quirky, funny ideas.
   He's a man who takes chances with these expensive fabrics and he
usually wins, though not always. The applause after the show was
tepid.
   Bernard Arnault, head of the Agache financial consortium backing
Lacroix, waffled when asked if the eccentric, creative designer is
still a hot money-maker. ``His clothes are beautiful. That's all
that counts,'' he said.
   Lacroix's clothes with the draped fichu shoulder, the big hoods
or head scarves and collars over tiny skirts are great on the
runway, but perhaps not at every party, no matter how splashy.
   He used a lot of browns, dolling up pinstriped jackets with
draped satin fronts and sable cuffs, sometimes teamed with a
mole-colored velvet skirt. Mixing up textures with abandon, he put
a tiny lame ``damasked'' bolero over a trapeze minidress in shades
of mustard and burgundy, with a quilted velvet panel on the skirt.
   Some of the luxury fantasy was hilarious, till one tried to tote
up the cost of the enormous sable parka topping chocolate shorts
with braided silk cornrows flipping over them like a reggae singer
gone wild _ a mini-fantasy well over $30,000.
   Lacroix's violet jersey dress was a soothing contrast to all the
show-off fabrics. His little shortie flared coats in faille and
satin were wearable. There were wonderful moments like the long,
slinky carmine velvet coat with huge sparkling buttons worn over
slimming pants embroidered with stars.
   The brown and khaki silks were always topped up with lively
shades of coral, saffron, turquoise or gold.
   For evening, Lacroix's hand-painted pink and green tulle
ballerina fantasies and jeweled tunics looked like a Midsummer
Night's Dream of luxury. Other ballerina numbers were in rich red
velvet and black, always sparkling with touches of gold.
   The dazzling jeweled boleros and jackets looked like a treasure
trove of Ali Baba's Cave.
   And after Christian discovered his mom's lace-edged satin
slip-dress, his versions of lace for the runway simply took off in
a froth of glory.
   The heavy guipure effects, the lame-embroidered dresses in
khaki, cream and gold, the damasked and brocade dresses with
pheasant or ostrich-feather trim harked back to the best of the
negligee looks in the Twenties and Thirties. But things were always
a bit on the wild side _ a la Christian Lacroix.
   Japanese couturiere Hanae Mori, celebrating 35 years in the
fashion business and a new shop in Paris, showed beautifully
crafted clothes with more workmanship than fantasy.
   Her fit and cut are always impeccable, and the swirling
red-black-green harlequin coat over a pine green short sheath is
anything but stodgy. Her full-skirted grey flannel suits with black
velvet decor and the Mori trademark butterfly pins should please
her faithful regulars.
   Her true couture details _ like satin basketweaving basque
waists in suits _ testified to her craftsmanship. She was lavish
with fancy fabrics, but her lame-flecked or sequin-embroidered lace
numbers were demure rather than daring.
   The dresses that made one want to weep with joy were the chiffon
prints in Mori's ``old'' style _ the feather-light chiffon print
landscapes with the most delicate Japanese prints of flowers, trees
and birds.
   Torrente's forte is showbiz, and she wisely showed plenty of
spangled numbers to look great onstage or at a gala dinner.
   Her three full, long cashmere wraparound coats in emerald,
cardinal and rust looked light, easy and warm. Her saffron fitted
spencer jacket over an aubergine long, slinky skirt is a good way
of easing into evening.
   And she went all out for late-day glitz: a few jet embroidered
dresses had discreet trains. Colorful patchwork jackets had fur or
ostrich-feather cuffs. The all-sequined slink would be fine for
midnight at Las Vegas. Easier to wear would be the tuxedos with big
pearl pink satin lapels.

<TEXT>
   All 106 opposition members in
parliament's lower house resigned today, saying a foreign arms deal
that allegedly involved kickbacks had destroyed confidence in Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government.
   They are demanding that Gandhi step down and call new elections.
   As deputies from deputies from Gandhi's Congress Party chanted
``shame, shame,'' the lawmakers from the 12 opposition parties
handed their letters of resignation to Speaker Balram Jakhar.
   Gandhi quietly looked on.
   Although opposition politicians have in the past boycotted
entire sessions of parliament, they had never resigned.
   Still, Gandhi's party holds a solid majority in the 544-member
chamber and the opposition's departure likely will have no effect.
   In a rare display of solidarity, the usually fractious and
unruly opposition on Sunday announced its decision to resign,
citing an auditor's report on inconsistencies in the 1986 purchase
of artillery from a Swedish firm.
   By giving up their seats, opposition leaders said, they hoped
the billion-dollar deal would be a major issue in the next general
election, which Gandhi must call by January.
   ``Never before has the office of the prime minister been brought
into disrepute as under the present incumbent,'' said V.P. Singh,
leader of the People's Party. ``We were all elected by the people
and now we are going back to them for their verdict on this issue.''
   Government officials contend the deal was sanctioned by Sing,
who at that time served as finance minister in Gandhi's Cabinet.
Singh left the governing party in 1987.
   As he left Parliament, Singh denied any wrongdoing but added if
anyone had proof, ``They should prosecute me.''
   Besides the People's Party, the opposition parties include the
Indian People's Party, the Party of the Telugus, the two major
Communist parties and seven regional groups.
   The rest of the seats are controlled by Gandhi's Congress Party
and independents.
   After the auditor general's report was released on Tuesday,
opposition members in parliament shouted anti-government slogans,
called Gandhi a thief and demanded his resignation. When he
refused, they walked out and stalled the proceeedings for three
days.
   The $1.4 billion deal has been a major scandal for Gandhi's
government because of allegations that the Swedish firm AB Bofors
paid kickbacks to secure the contract.
   Newspapers and opposition politicians say kickbacks amounting to
at least $50 million were paid to senior government officials and
to Congress Party coffers. The allegations have never been proved.
   The report by the auditor general said the arms purchase was
flawed on technical considerations and cost assessment.
   Opposition parties have been using the Bofors issue to try to
merge and mount a viable challenge to Gandhi and the Congress Party
in the general election. But their efforts have stalled in
squabbling and widely-publicized power struggles for nearly a year.
   N.T. Rama Rao, leader of the Telugus Party, said the decision to
resign from parliment proved the opposition could unite on major
issues.
   ``We are committed to give a clean government to the country,''
he said.

   A man with a semiautomatic handgun opened
fire at a bus at a busy downtown stop, killing the driver and a
rider, then fled by critically wounding a motorist and taking his
car.
   ``The guy just raised his arm and pow, pow, pow!'' said Devin
Oppy, who was sitting in the rear of the bus when the shooting
occurred Sunday afternoon.
   Police were searching for the gunman and his getaway car today.
They said there was no apparent motive for the shootings.
   ``There is nothing to indicate (the gunman) was waiting for
somebody. I have no reason to believe he knew his intended
victims,'' said Hollywood Police Sgt. Darron Castiglione.
   ``He's killed two people and critically wounded one for no
apparent reason.''
   Witnesses said the unidentified gunman had been drinking wine on
a bus stop bench in front of a busy supermarket in Hollywood, a
suburb north of Miami.
   After the county bus pulled up and other passengers got on, he
opened fire at the driver and then sprayed the bus, police and
witnesses said.
   ``The door opened. He stood up, reached under his shirt and
pulled out a gun,'' said Oppy, 28. ``The driver looked at him and
he shot him three times in the head. He didn't say a word. People
were screaming and jumping on the floor. I kept saying, `Get down!'
''
   Sydney Granger, 43, a driver for the Broward County Transit
Authority, was pronounced dead at the scene. An immigrant from
Grenada with several children, he was making his last round and had
about 30 minutes left on his shift at the time of the attack.
   A passenger apparently killed by bullets fired through the
windows had not been identified by early today.
   Neither victim was robbed and they appeared to have been
selected at random, police said.
   After the shootings, the gunman calmly strolled through a
supermarket parking lot to a nearby intersection, banged his gun on
the window of a car and ordered the driver out, witnesses said.
   Scott Yaguda, 31, a tourist from Alexandria, Va., surrendered
his car and was walking away when the gunman shot him three times,
twice in the back, witnesses said.
   ``The (gunman) seemed like he didn't have a care in the world,''
said Susan Miller, 40, who ran to call police. ``He just lifted his
arm and bang, bang, bang.''
   Yaguda was taken to Memorial Hospital in Hollywood where he was
listed in critical condition today, a nursing supervisor said.
   As the gunman drove off, a 16-year-old service station attendant
who asked to remain unidentified tried to pursue, but gave up the
chase after a few blocks because the man was driving too fast.
   The gunman was described by witnesses as white and in his 40s
with a moustache, dark hair in a pony tail and wearing a red plaid
shirt and blue jeans, said Police spokeswoman Joycelyn Alston.
   James King, 40, had just stepped off the bus and walked past the
gunman when he heard shots and ran inside a nearby store.
   ``I looked him dead in the face,'' said King. ``He was calm. He
didn't look like the type of person who would get up and kill three
people. He looked like a regular street person. Fifteen seconds
later, he started shooting.''

   A year after a wealthy woman was abducted
after a bridge party, authorities don't know whether she is alive
but they promise surprises when a lawyer goes on trial in
connection with her disappearance.
   Annie Laurie Hearin, then 72, disappeared from her Jackson home
on July 26, 1988. Her husband of 49 years, Robert, reported her
missing.
   Newton Alfred Winn, a St. Petersburg, Fla., lawyer, faces
federal charges of conspiracy to kidnap, extortion by mail and
perjury in connection with Mrs. Hearin's disappearance. He is to
stand trial Aug. 28 in Hattiesburg.
   The case has been chronicled in newspapers and magazines and
featured on the national television programs, ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' and ``Inside Story.''
   But FBI spokesman Stewart Murphy said in an interview last week
that much remains to be told, and some will be revealed during the
trial.
   Court-appointed defense attorney John Colette agreed. ``There
will be a great deal of surprises,'' he said.
   The only word from Mrs. Hearin or her abductors has been a vague
ransom note left at the scene and a blood-stained note from Mrs.
Hearin dated Aug. 10.
   The ransom note demanded that Hearin settle matters with 12
franchisers sued by School Pictures of Mississippi Inc., a company
formerly controlled by Hearin.
   Although the kidnappers never made any specific demands, Hearin
paid a total of $1 million to the 12 franchisers after receiving
the note from his wife. Hearin's worth is estimated at between $100
million and $200 million.
   Winn was one of the franchisers. He voluntarily returned the
money.
   According to court records, a federal judge had ordered Winn to
pay $90,000 in June 1983 and $153,883 in 1984 to the Jackson-based
School Pictures. Winn has said he lost his life's savings,.
   According to information released so far, Winn's arrest stemmed
from statements by an unnamed woman who says he paid her $500 to
dye her hair and otherwise disguise herself, travel to Atlanta and
mail what is believed to be the Aug. 10 note from Mrs. Hearin.
   The woman hasn't been charged, authorities said.
   Mrs. Hearin's family has declined to comment on the anniversary
of her disappearance.
   But Oralee Buie, who played bridge with Mrs. Hearin just hours
before her abduction, said the adjustment without her friend of
almost 50 years has been trying.
   ``It's just very discouraging,'' she said. ``There's always hope
since we don't know, but it's hard to hold onto that hope.''

<HEAD>Dollar Retreating in Calm, Late-morning Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was retreating in quiet European
trading late this morning as commercial banks sold the U.S.
currency.
   Gold prices moved slightly higher.
   Traders said the foreign exchange market wasn't showing much
reaction to the defeat of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party in
Sunday's parliamentary election and the subsequent announcement by
Premier Sousuke Uno that he would resign.
   Traders said a political change in Japan had been widely
expected for weeks and was already fully discounted in the yen's
exchange rates.
   Traders said they expected trading conditions to remain calm at
least until the opening of the New York market.
   They said the European market was thin because it was the
vacation season. They said they didn't expect any new initiatives
to come from the European players over the next few weeks.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.20 yen to a closing 141.95 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 142.28 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   --1.9049 West German marks, down from 1.9055
   --1.6445 Swiss francs, down from 1.6455
   --6.4566 French francs, up from 6.4460
   --2.1519 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1350
   --1,376.25 Italian lire, up from 1,371.50
   --$1.8888 Canadian, up from $1.8880
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6210 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6185 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $371.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $371.50. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $372.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $372 unchanged from late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 10 cents to close at a bid
$372.99. Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.21 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Friday.

<HEAD>Tornado Slams Florida; Thunderstorms in the Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Scattered thunderstorms continued over the Southeast today, part
of a storm system that spawned a tornado that roared through a
Florida town and cut a mile-long swathe of destruction.
   The twister Sunday in South Fort Myers damaged the roofs of 10
businesses and 29 boats from a marine sales business. It slammed
one boat into an office building, and also damaged 36 mobile homes
and seven condomiums.
   Thunderstorms erupted Sunday evening across the Rockies. High
winds blew down large trees at Helena, Mont., and winds gusted up
to 58 mph at Elko, Nev.
   Scattered thunderstorms doused Kentucky, the Tennessee and lower
Mississippi valleys, and parts of Texas.
   Heavy rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included 1.5 inches at Tampa, Fla., .98 inches at Centreville,
Ala., .69 inches at Farmington, N.M., and half an inch at
Knoxville, Tenn.
   Fog hung today over the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and the
northern and Middle Atlantic Coast.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms during the
afternoon and evening across the central Rockies, the Plains, Texas
and much of the Southeast and Gulf region.
   Highs were to be in the 70s across the central and northern
Pacific Coast; in the 90s across much of Nevada and Utah, the
central Rockies to the northern Plains, in central and southern
Texas, in Florida, and from the Carolinas to Long Island; from 100
to 110 degrees across the Desert Southwest; and in the 80s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 44 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 98 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>Arafat: PLO Has Had Direct Contact with Israeli Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat says in an interview
published today that Israel has opened direct contacts with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Arafat was quoted by the Rome daily Il Messaggero as saying a
member of the PLO's executive committee met recently in Vienna with
an envoy of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   He did not identify the two officials or give any details of the
talks.
   The Israeli government has repeatedly denied it is carrying out
direct or indirect negotiations with the PLO, which it describes as
a terrorist organization intent on the destruction of the Jewish
state.
   Arafat was interviewed by Il Messaggero in Tunis, Tunisia, the
political headquarters of the PLO.
   He was quoted as saying that Shamir himself had met with
Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories who are tied to the
PLO. He showed the interviewer what he described as a written
report about a 45-minute meeting on July 12 between Shamir and
Palestinians.
   ``Shamir says he's meeting Palestinian representatives of the
occupied territories,'' Arafat was quoted as saying. ``Secret
meetings, he says, against the will of the PLO.
   ``It's not true. None of these meetings was held against our
will. We approve them from the beginning and after the talks we
received complete reports from our cadres.''
   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, has said the prime minister
held two meetings with Palestinians from the occupied territories
this month. Israeli officials refuse to say who the Palestinians
are, claiming the lives of the dialogue partners would be
threatened by the PLO.
   ``Shamir knows well that there are no Palestinians inside
Palestine or outside Palestine who do not belong to the PLO,''
Arafat was quoted as saying. ``Why is he trying to stage this show?
He's trying to open a dialogue with the PLO far away from the U.S.
administration that he's trying to deceive.''
   Arafat said the PLO's dialogue with the United States had not
produced any concrete results so far.
   ``But the decision by Congress to reject the request to block
the dialogue with the PLO was important,'' he said. ``A very
positive sign.''

   Iran today hanged 22 people convicted of
drug smuggling or prostitution, including nine women and four
Afghan nationals, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the men were hanged in
public squares around Tehran and the women at a jail outside the
capital.
   It said they were convicted of smuggling, selling and
distributing heroin and opium, prostitution and spreading
corruption.
   The hangings brought to 810 the number of officially reported
executions under an anti-narcotics law that mandates the death
penalty for possession of even small quantities of drugs. The law
took effect in January.
   IRNA said a six-month grace period for addicts to kick the habit
expired Sunday and they would be rounded up and sent to labor camps
and other rehabilitation centers.
   Law enforcement officials have said they have identified 80
percent of Iranian drug addicts. Authorities have said that 1
million Iranians are involved in drug abuse but unofficial
estimates put the figure at 2 million of the country's 50 million
population.

<HEAD>Eds: Retransmits to change category code.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greg LeMond tried to become just another American
in Paris, but he had a hard time going unnoticed at the Moulin
Rouge.
   Less than six hours earlier on Sunday, he had won the Tour de
France, the famed French cycling race. He staged a miraculous
comeback to win the 2,020-mile, 23-day race by the closest victory
margin ever _ eight seconds over Laurent Fignon of France.
   So, it's no surprise he was greeted by applause at the Moulin
Rouge, the famous nightclub.
   The victory completed a dramatic recovery for LeMond from
misfortune suffered after he became the first American to prevail
in cycling's most famous race in 1986.
   In April 1987 he was accidentally shot by his brother-in-law
while hunting. Then he had an emergency appendectomy followed by
shin surgery. All of which made him miss the Tour in 1987 and 1988.
   He came back this year with low expectations.
   ``One month ago, I didn't think I would be in the top 10, top
20,'' LeMond said. ``But through the race I got more confident.''
   Confident enough to overcome Fignon's apparently insurmountable
50-second lead in the final stage, a 15-mile time trial from
Versailles to Paris.
   ``I went all out,'' LeMond said. ``I didn't think I was going to
win. The worst thing I could have done was lose by a second _ the
worst thing.''

<HEAD>Six Arrested for Disorderly Conduct on Airliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A husband-wife tiff aboard an airliner escalated
to a fight among several passengers and led to the arrest of six
people from the Continental Airlines plane at Logan International
Airport.
   ``They had a little brawl,'' state police Cpl. Joseph Howley
said of the weekend incident aboard an MD-80 jet with 146
passengers aboard.
   ``It started out as a husband and wife that were sort of running
around the plane and making demands on the crew and being a general
nuisance and hollering,'' Howley said.
   Officials available today were unable to say if blows were
exchanged on the flight Saturday, but said the husband struggled
with police who arrested him in the airport terminal.
   Facing arraignment today on a variety of charges are Steven
Sacks-Wilner, 39, attorney for Republicans in the New Jersey
Senate, and his wife, Joane, 37. Also arrested were a Medford,
Mass., family, Frank J. Federico, 50, his wife, Camella, 48, and
their son John, 22, and John's girlfriend, Laureen Belmonte.
   Sacks-Wilner is charged with interfering with a flight crew,
being a disorderly person and three counts of assault on a police
officer for allegedly resisting officers at the gate. The others
were charged with interfering with a flight crew.
   The Massachusetts State Police say the fracas aboard the flight
took place when the plane was in the air, and forced the pilot to
abort the landing Saturday evening.
   But airline spokesman Ned Walker insisted the fight took place
on the ground, and that the pilot aborted his first landing attempt
because another plane was slow to taxi out of the way.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigting, said
Michael Ciccarelli, a spokesman in Boston. He said the agency was
told the pilot made a routine manuever for a second landing because
the plane ahead was slow to clear the runway.

<HEAD>Canadian Province Declares State of Emergency to Fight Forest Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The provincial government has declared
a state of emergency to fight raging forest fires and help house
thousands the blazes have left homeless.
   About 18,000 people have been airlifted from remote Indian
reserves and farms in the province, where the fires have swept
through nearly 2 million acres of dense evergreen forest.
   ``Virtually all of northern Manitoba is on fire and we're just
hoping some of our major centers are not going to be affected,''
Emergency Measures Minister Albert Driedger said on Sunday. ``Once
you get 15 minutes out of Winnipeg, all you see is smoke.''
   Hot, dry and windy weather fanned the flames of more than 400
fires across northern Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Lightning
is blamed for most blazes, but police believe people started at
least two.
   Weather forecasts preducted thundershowers today, but officials
fear that may mean more lightning fires. A change in wind direction
today could cause additional problems, the Natural Resources
Department said.
   Driedger declared the state of emergency Sunday night.
   ``What was needed was the power to get placements (for
evacuees), equipment, supplies,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pelvic Bone Supports Alferd Packer Claim of Self Defense</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Alferd is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE CITY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recovery of five skeletons from a
115-year-old grave in Deadman's Gulch has given investigators new
clues about the deaths of confessed cannibal Alferd Packer's gold
prospecting companions.
   Scientists removing the skeletal remains Sunday found distinct
scrape marks on bones from two of the skeletons, indicating they'd
been cut and scraped or ``defleshed,'' said Walter Birkby, curator
of physical anthropology at the University of Arizona.
   There were punch marks in one bone, which scientists said were
probably made by a coyote eating the remains after the spring thaw
of 1874.
   On Saturday, they found a bullet hole in a right pelvic bone _
possible support for Packer's claim that one member of the party
killed the other four and that Packer shot that man in self-defense.
   Packer emerged from the mountains in April 1874, but the remains
of his companions weren't found and buried until that August.
   The Packer Project, which includes forensic anthropologists, a
forensic pathologist, and an expert on fibers and tool marks on
bones, packed the bones up Sunday for detailed laboratory study and
reconstruction.
   They hope their work will determine whether one hatchet was used
to kill four of the men and another was used on the fifth.
   That would support Packer's story that Shannon Wilson Bell
killed the first four with a hatchet before Packer killed Bell in
self-defense, shooting him in the stomach and hitting him on the
head with a hatchet.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Divers preparing the crippled Exxon Valdez to
enter San Diego Harbor went back to work today cutting away massive
steel plates dangling from the ship's hull.
   Three plates were severed over the weekend from the tanker that
ran onto a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound March 24 and
spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in the nation's worst oil
spill.
   The plates, which ripped loose as the ship was being brought to
San Diego for repairs, must be removed so the tanker can enter
shallow San Diego Bay.
   Among the plates removed was a slab weighing an estimated 50
tons and measuring 72 feet long and 68 feet across. Another cut
Sunday was 30 feet long and 35 feet across, said Exxon spokeswoman
Jan Cool.
   The plates won't be salvaged because they are too heavy, Ms.
Cool said.
   Instead, divers allowed them to fall 3,000 feet to the ocean
floor, Cool said.
   Some of the plates were hanging 90 feet below the surface, and
San Diego Bay is only about 40 feet deep in some spots.
   The Valdez was about 54 miles off San Diego and six miles
northeast of on San Clemente Island.
   California officials worried about possible pollution have yet
to reach agreement with Exxon on terms governing the tanker's
entrance into the harbor.

   After he bounced off the ceiling a second time and
the plane began shaking and dropping, Bob Watson was sure American
Airlines Flight 1707 from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami would
crash.
   ``Everybody thought that was it,'' said Watson, 39, a tennis pro
from Jensen Beach. ``I was resigned to dying.''
   About 45 passengers on the American Airlines A-300 Airbus were
treated for cuts and bruises after the plane was jolted by
turbulence at 35,000 feet during its descent into Miami
International Airport Saturday night.
   John Hotard, an airline spokesman, said Sunday in Fort Worth,
Texas, that the pilot's radar hadn't shown the storm that buffeted
the plane.
   The airliner, carrying 239 passengers and a crew of nine, landed
at 11 p.m. Several people were removed in wheelchairs and
stretchers.
   The injured were taken to Jackson Memorial, Hialeah and Palmetto
General hospitals. Most of the injuries were neck and shoulder
sprains, and there were no broken bones, Hotard said. Several of
the injured were admitted overnight for observation, and the
hospitals reported that all were released Sunday morning.
   The plane's exterior was undamaged, Hotard said, but 12 seats
were damaged, and holes were punched in the cabin's overhead
compartments.
   Watson said the three-hour flight had been uneventful until
about 30 minutes out of Miami. He was reading a book, the seat-belt
warning lights weren't on, and his seatbelt was unhooked, Watson
said.
   Then, without warning, ``All of a sudden there was this
tremendous boom. I flew up and hit the ceiling. I came down in my
seat, and about two seconds later, I flew up and hit my head
again.''
   As he was bouncing around, he said, he looked and saw ``other
people were doing it too. Some people's heads broke right through
the ceiling panel. It was unbelievable. People were screaming and
crying.''

   After swimming most of the length of
New Jersey, Skip Storch says he's pretty impressed with the
condition of the ocean, even though his last two days found him
stroking past some unusual floating debris.
   Storch, 31, a self-described ``environmental swimmer,''
completed the final leg of a 100-mile swim down the New Jersey
coast Sunday, continuing his quest to draw attention to coastal
pollution.
   On the final leg, en route from Brigantine to Atlantic City, he
had to navigate around a watermelon, a wooden crate and a potato
sack. It was the end of a swim that began Monday at Liberty Island
in Upper New York Bay.
   Storch, a gemologist from Monsey, N.Y., says he suffered
thousands of jellyfish stings on his journey.
   But he said he encountered less pollution than he did last year
when he swam 153 miles down the Hudson River from Albany, N.Y., to
the Statue of Liberty to draw attention to the state of the river.
   ``If I was to walk, it wouldn't make an impression,'' Storch
said of the pollution after emerging from the water in front of
Caesars Hotel Casino.
   ``As far as the water quality I'd give it a B,'' Storch said
Sunday in a mid-swim interview with WCBS radio. ``As far as
improvement, I'd give it a B+.''
   Storch, accompanied by two boats, swam each day from about 10:30
a.m. to 4 p.m. and devoted the rest of the time to environmental
awareness events.
   As Storch's trip got under way last week, the state had its
first widespread beach closings in Cape May County, when fecal
coliform bacteria exceeded acceptable levels.

   After getting a taste of being flavor of the
month in Hollywood, 26-year-old filmmaker Steven Soderbergh is
retreating from the bright lights, his bag stuffed with big movie
projects.
   Soderbergh, whose ``Sex, Lies and Videotape'' won the Golden
Palm at the Cannes Film Festival this year, has new assignments
from Robert Redford, Sydney Pollack and Barry Levinson.
   But instead of setting up shop in Hollywood, he left Southern
California recently to return to Charlottesville, Va., where he
lived from age 10 to 13.
   Soderbergh talked about gaining Hollywood's favor and its
disadvantages in an interview published Sunday in The New York
Times.
   ``You begin to be treated better than other people,'' he said.
``I'm a big believer in doing your own dirty work. It takes effort
to make sure you don't lose touch with the reality 99 percent of
the people on this planet experience.''
   The film, which opens Aug. 4 in New York and Los Angeles, was
selected over Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'' for Cannes'
highest honor. Soderbergh had only kind words for Lee.
   ``Spike Lee is a brave man with a movie camera,'' said
Soderbergh. ``His films have to make money. If you're a black
filmmaker and your film doesn't make money it's harder to get
another job than if you're a white filmmaker and your film doesn't
make money.''
   Soderbergh was the youngest director ever to win first prize at
Cannes with his film about the sexual impulses of men and women and
the lies they tell each other and themselves.
   Since then, Redford's company has hired him to adapt and direct
A.E. Hotchner's memoir ``King of the Hill,'' and he will direct
``Kafka,'' based on a screenplay by Lem Dobbs, for Levinson. His
first project is to write and direct ``The Last Ship,'' based on
William Brinkley's novel, for Universal Pictures. The film is to be
produced by Pollack.

<HEAD>Thatcher Prepares To Shuffle Cabinet As Gov't Popularity Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher summoned Cabinet
ministers for private interviews today ahead of what aides called
changes aimed at halting her Conservative government's slide in
popularity.
   A senior Thatcher aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
a ``freshening'' of the 22-member Cabinet would likely be announced
this evening.
   Apart from the Cabinet changes, Mrs. Thatcher appeared virtually
certain to appoint a new chairman of her Conservative Party
following a drubbing by socialists in June 15 elections for the
European Parliament.
   Speculation of an unexpected change increased after Energy
Secretary Cecil Parkinson, a Thatcher favorite whose political
career was interrupted after an extramarital liaison six years ago,
arrived today at her 10 Downing St. office.
   Parkinson, who is married, resigned from the Cabinet in 1983
after news broke that his secretary, alleged to be his mistress,
was pregnant. Mrs. Thatcher reappointed him when she won a third
successive five-year term in elections in June 1987.
   Also summoned today were Education Secretary Kenneth Baker, a
moderate in the mainly right-wing Cabinet, who is widely expected
to replace the current Conservative Party Chairman, Peter Brooke,
and Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley.
   Ridley, chain-smoking scion of an aristocratic family, was
expected to become the new Trade and Industry Secretary, replacing
Lord Young, a non-career politician who has said he wants to resume
his business interests.
   Ridley, accused by critics of mishandling the current passage
through Parliament of a controversial property tax, is blamed by
large sections of the party for increasing the government's current
unpopularity.
   But Mrs. Thatcher, who has the sole power to appoint Cabinet
ministers, has publicly defended him.
   Changes in about 90 government posts which do not carry Cabinet
rank, were expected Tuesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher's government has trailed the revived socialist
opposition Labor Party in public opinion polls for several months.
   In the latest poll by Harris, published Sunday in The Observer,
a liberal weekly, Labor was seven points ahead of the Conservatives
with 44 percent support. The remainder was split among minority
parties.
   The 2,000 voters questioned were critical of the government for
its handling of the National Health Service, public transport, the
new property tax, proposals to privatize water supply and rising
inflation.
   No margin of error was given for the nationwide poll, conducted
Thursday and Friday by telephone.
   In the European elections, Labor garnered 40.1 percent of the
vote, compared with the Conservatives' 34.7 percent.
   Adding to Mrs. Thatcher's problems is a revival of labor union
militancy, including a wave of public transportation strikes.
   Inflation, the cornerstone of Mrs. Thatcher's rigorous economic
policies since she won power 10 years ago, is now back among the
highest in the Western world at 8.3 percent.

   HP Foods Ltd. said today that slivers of glass
were deliberately placed in cans of baked beans while they were
being processed last month, and police are investigating.
   Glass has been found in six cans of HP Beans, all bought from
the same supermarket in Barnsley, central England.
   HP said in a statement that the cans were part of a batch of
200,000 canned on June 21 at its factory in North Walsham in
eastern England and sent to northern England. The time of the
canning is known to within five minutes, it said.
   ``It is generally agreed that it could not have happened during
the normal process of production and therefore we must assume it
(the glass) was deliberately placed,'' said a company spokesman,
requesting anonymity.
   HP said most of the cans in the batch had been located and were
on their way back to the company.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told legislators today that
the strikes that have swept the Soviet Union's major coal fields
for nearly two weeks have been the ``biggest test'' of his four
years in power.
   He blamed coal ministry and local officials rather than the
miners for the unrest _ which halted work at mines in all the
country's major coal fields _ but he said ``deciding such questions
by striking will ruin our tasks.''
   The Soviet president said most striking miners have returned to
work, including at least half the 300,000 miners in the country's
biggest coal basin, the 121-mine Donetsk region in the Ukraine.
   ``We are coming out of a very serious crisis, the biggest test
during the four years of perestroika,'' Gorbachev told the Supreme
Soviet, referring to his program of restructuring economic and
political life.
   On Sunday, Gorbachev said in a rare television interview that he
was ``inspired'' by the workers' initiative although he disagreed
with their tactics. He also said he understood why the miners
mistrusted a government that long ignored them.
   The strikers in the Donetsk basin were among the last holdouts
from the nationwide coal strike that started in western Siberia
July 11 and spread to the Arctic Circle and Central Asia.
   The strikes began to ebb Friday as the Siberia strikers returned
to work Friday after exacting promises of higher pay, better food,
clothing and housing and greater control over their industry.
   The government said those concessions would apply to striking
miners nationwide.
   Strikers in the Donetsk have held out for legal guarantees from
the Supreme Soviet that the government would keep the promises it
made to miners in a settlement signed Saturday by strike leaders
and government officials.
   A lawmaker from the Pechora coal basin in the far north told the
Supreme Soviet that miners around the city of Vorkuta also remained
on strike, in part due to ``disinformation'' by the media.
   Miner Vladimir P. Lushnikov said state-run media reported
erroneously that the Vorkuta strike ended.
   According to recent reports, miners remained on strike at 11 of
the 13 mines in Vorkuta and at all 12 mines in Chervonograd in the
western Ukraine.
   Lawmakers speaking at today's Supreme Soviet session, which was
broadcast nationally with a slight tape delay, said the strikes
showed that the country needed more effective unions.
   ``We have to admit that the trade unions don't have the workers'
faith,'' said Lithuanian deputy Kazimeras Uoka. ``We have to give
them the right to establish independent trade unions.''
   Soviet unions act as adjuncts of the government, handling the
distribution of various benefits rather than fighting for workers'
rights.
   Several deputies from mining regions also called for moving up
local elections from spring to this fall to give voters a chance to
oust officials who were insensitive to miners' needs.
   Gorbachev responded that decisions on how the local elections
are run should be taken in the republics, not in Moscow, even if
that means election laws and schedules will vary from place to
place.
   ``Shall we torpedo and limit this?'' he asked. ``We will hardly
succeed, commanding from here.''
   Gorbachev proposed that instead of waiting for elections, all
local councils around the country hold immediate meetings to
``examine the concrete situations in all regions with the aim of
activizing the work of our councils everywhere.''
   Alexei Boiko from the Donetsk appealed to Gorbachev and Prime
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to meet with a delegation of his
region's miners to hasten a resolution of its waning strikes.
   The walkout in the region began on July 15.
   More than 5,000 strikers continued demonstrating Sunday on the
central square in the city of Donetsk, 900 miles south of Moscow,
and miners at each pit were deciding for themselves whether to
resume work, a strike leader said in a telephone interview.
   The settlement in the Donetsk included earlier pension
eligibility, pay increases and longer vacations.
   Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet the strikes dealt a serious
blow to the economy, but he reassured his countrymen that ``our
perestroika will give results despite the tests we are undergoing.''
   The labor unrest is the country's worst in 60 years and would
have been unthinkable before Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and
loosened restrictions on civil liberties.
   At the strikes' peak, reports indicated half the coal industry's
1 million workers were off the job.

   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's wily
Parliament speaker, is so confident he will be elected the Islamic
Republic's fourth president that he isn't even campaigning.
   ``People don't expect me to put up posters and photos,'' the
55-year-old cleric was quoted as telling the Tehran daily newspaper
Jomhuri Islami.
   Polls published by some newspapers indicate that when Iranians
cast ballots on Friday, Rafsanjani will win 86 percent of the vote.
   They give his only challenger, Abbas Sheibani, a colorless
former agriculture minister, a paltry 11 percent. Three percent of
Iranians questioned said they would not vote.
   The media, much of it controlled by the speaker's brother
Mohammad and Rafsanjani's allies, are already speculating about who
will be in Rafsanjani's Cabinet. Little is reported about
Sheibani's campaign.
   Although he is not stumping, Rafsanjani has kept a high profile
through newspaper interviews. He has stressed that his priority is
rebuilding Iran's sagging economy, slashing inflation, boosting
production and creating jobs.
   The presidential vote, originally scheduled for Aug. 18, was
moved up three weeks to accelerate the transition of power
following the June 3 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
revolutionary patriarch.
   That transition has been smooth so far, despite bitter rivalries
within the Tehran hierarchy between Rafsanjani's so-called
pragmatists and radicals led by Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi.
   Rafsanjani is certain to inherit a more powerful presidency than
his predecessor and ally, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was chosen
Iran's supreme religious leader following Khomeini's death.
   A national referendum that will be held alongside the
presidential vote is expected to win approval for proposed
constitutional amendments that will increase the president's
powers, making him head of government and scrapping the post of
prime minister.
   The reforms will streamline Iran's government by eliminating
competing power centers that have virtually paralyzed
decision-making and delayed the formulation of a sound economic
strategy following the cease-fire last August in the 8-year war
with Iraq.
   Analysts say that election of the popular Rafsanjani would usher
in a new, more liberal era in Iran, which was dominated for the
last 10 turbulent years by Khomeini and his fundamentalist Islamic
ideology.
   It would probably bring new moves to build bridges with the West.
   Rafsanjani and Khamenei have clearly outmaneuvered the radicals,
including Khomeini's son, Ahmad, 43, who was known to have had
presidential aspirations but did not throw his turban into the ring.
   The English-language Tehran Times, which supports Rafsanjani,
tipped Ahmad as Rafsanjani's successor as speaker in what was a
clear hint to Khomeini's heir that he would not be left out in the
cold if he played ball.
   Hard-liners will likely be offered positions in the new
government, but with diminished powers.
   Presidential elections in Iran since the 1979 revolution have
always been one-horse races. The first president, Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr was elected in January 1980 with 75 percent of the vote,
far outstripping his two nearest rivals.
   Sheibani, 58, a French-trained physician, ran in the July 1981
presidential election _ called when the liberal Bani-Sadr was
forced into exile by Islamic hard-liners _ against then-Prime
Minister Mohammad Ali Rajaie and two other candidates.
   Rajaie won with a landslide 13 million of the 14.7 million votes
cast _ and was assassinated by leftist rivals 37 days later.
   His successor, Khamenei, won a whopping 95 percent of the 16.8
million votes cast. His three rivals could only muster 5 percent
between them.
   Sheibani has represented a Tehran district in the 270-seat
parliament since April 1984, but has no national political base. He
is linked with Mehdi Bazargan's small Freedom Movement, Iran's
token opposition party.
   He and Rafsanjani were the only two of 80 Iranians who applied
to contest the presidency to be approved by the 12-member Council
of Guardians, a constitutional watchdog body.
   Sheibani's candidacy looks suspiciously like a token tilt toward
democracy so that Rafsanjani will not be elected unopposed.
   Iran's electorate was estimated at around 25 million during last
year's parliamentary elections.

kept from their homes until the fire burns itself out, which was
expected sometime today, said R. Lindsay Leckie, senior manager of
news and media relations for CSX Transportation Inc., which owns
the train.
   A team of hazardous material experts checked the fire shortly
after dawn and found it reduced greatly, but still burning, Leckie
said. Officials hope later today to begin allowing people to return
home.
   ``After safety, the top priority for CSX and the local officials
is as quickly as it is possible, to reduce the size of the
evacuated area,'' he said.
   Even after the fire goes out, the evacuation will remain in
effect in the immediate area as hazardous materials experts examine
the 14 derailed cars and determine how to handle their contents,
Leckie said.
   Monitoring around the tank cars found no dangerous levels of
toxic chemicals, and no long-term effects to homes or possessions
were anticipated, Leckie said.
   The burning cars did not threaten other chemical-laden cars in
the 32-car train, Leckie said earlier.
   Three tank cars burst into flames after Saturday's derailment.
One carload of highly flammable naphtha burned up within an hour,
sending up a fireball and column of smoke.
   Two homes were destroyed by the fire, but no serious injuries
were reported.
   A carload of acrylic acid burned itself out Sunday, but the
third tanker, containing chlorosilene continued to burn early
today. Experts decided the safest way to handle the fire was to let
it burn itself out.
   The chemical is a flammable liquid used in silicon production.
It is made by Dow Corning Corp., a joint venture between Dow
Chemical Co. and Corning Glass Works.
   Unofficial estimates on the numbers of evacuees ranged from 400
to 2,000, but the Red Cross and Tittabawassee Township officials
said they'd been too busy to make an accurate count. The Saginaw
County township, located about 100 miles northwest of Detroit, has
a population of 5,000.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
arrived in Freeland on Sunday. Leckie said it would take as long as
several weeks for the railroad to determine the cause of the crash.
   ``Right now, the safety of our workers is the number one
priority,'' he said.
   It was the third derailment involving a CSX train in Michigan
within a year. Leckie said the company had found no links between
the first two derailments and didn't believe there were any
problems with the way the company conducts its operations.
   Leckie said the train was traveling at about 37 mph when it
derailed. He said the section of track where the accident occurred
has been inspected once a week, most recently by the Federal
Railroad Administration and CSX engineers last Tuesday.
   The three-member train crew also inspected the train before it
left Port Huron for Midland, he added.

   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno announced today he will
resign after his scandal-plagued party suffered a stinging
electoral defeat, losing control of a house of parliament for the
first time in its 34 years.
   ``It was a very difficult election,'' Uno told a nationally
televised news conference.
   Uno has been prime minister less than two months, but he said
his party's loss of control of parliament's upper house in Sunday
elections ultimately is his responsibility.
   The long-governing Liberal Democrats have seen their popularity
plummet over an influence-peddling scandal, a new 3 percent sales
tax and the liberalization of agricultural imports, which farmers
say hurts their livelihood.
   Uno has been criticized for alleged extramarital affairs,
including with a geisha who said he paid her to be his mistress for
several months.
   He said he hoped a successor could be found ``promptly.''
Analysts said the process could take several weeks.
   Uno's resignation will result in the dissolution of the Cabinet
and restructuring of the governing party's leadership.
   But some Liberal Democrats said this would not solve the
problems.
   ``It's a question of why we lost,'' said Yohei Koono, a liberal
lower house lawmaker. ``If our choice of policies is wrong, we need
to change it.''
   Business leaders urged thorough political reforms from the party
that guided Japan's rapid postwar economic growth.
   ``We should not allow this to have an adverse effect on economic
activity or the people's lives,'' said Eishiro Saito, chairman of
the powerful Japan Federation of Economic Organizations.
   In the balloting for half the 252 seats in parliament's upper
house, the big winner was the Japan Socialist Party, led by Takako
Doi, the first woman leader of a major Japanese party.
   Of 126 seats at stake, the Socialists won 46, the Liberal
Democrats 36. The Socialists' total strength in the chamber rose
from 43 to 66; the Liberal Democrats' fell from 142 to 109.
   Rengo (Confederation), a new labor-based group, won 11 seats and
the centrist Clean Government Party 10, with the rest split among
smaller parties.
   Ms. Doi said her party quickly will call a meeting of opposition
leaders to form a coalition against the Liberal Democrats, who
still hold 293 of the 512 seats in parliament's more powerful lower
house.
   Any coalition is expected to be fragile. While most major
opposition parties have called for abolishing the new sales tax,
they vary broadly on other issues such as defense policy, relations
with the United States, and nuclear power.
   With the loss of their majority in the upper house, however, the
Liberal Democrats will face greater difficulties in passing
legislation.
   The upper chamber can vote down bills and delay, but not block,
the budget and treaties.
   Ms. Doi called her party's victory ``the people's verdict,'' and
said Uno's decision to step down was ``only natural.''
   She said the Socialists' first priority is to pass a bill in the
upper house abolishing the sales tax. Such a bill is unlikely to be
approved by the lower house, however, and a standstill over the
issue could add to pressure for early elections for the lower
chamber. Legally, they do not have to be held for 12 months.
   A loss in the lower house would threaten the governing party's
34-year hold on power since that chamber chooses the prime minister.
   About 65 percent of Japan's 90.3 million eligible voters cast
ballots in Sunday's election, reflecting strong feelings over
issues affecting many people's everyday lives.
   Women were particularly unhappy over the new sales tax,
bulldozed through by the governing party despite an opposition
boycott.
   ``I really believe that this was a people's revolution coming
from the kitchen,'' said Kazuo Shinsaka, a Rengo candidate who won
election in Nara.
   A record 146 women candidates ran for office Sunday, and a
record 22 were elected, more than doubling female representation in
the chamber.
   ``One result of the election is that Japanese politicians from
now on will have to pay more attention to women,'' said Seisaburo
Sato, professor of political science at Tokyo University.
   Though Ms. Doi is immensely popular, her party has been widely
accused of lacking a realistic and constructive platform.
   In the past, it has called for Japan to disband its Self-Defense
Forces and scrap the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, under which 64,000
U.S. troops are stationed in Japan.
   Socialist leaders now say they would not immediately do away
with the armed forces and seek only to revise the treaty.
   Uno became prime minister June 2 after former Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita resigned to take responsibility for a scandal in
which the Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate, allegedly
distributed millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and political
donations to obtain favors.
   The governing party spent weeks finding an unsullied successor
for Takeshita. But shortly after taking office, Uno was linked to
the sex scandal.
   Asked how he felt after announcing his resignation, Uno, a poet,
said, ``My state of mind is `meikyo shisui''' _ meaning tranquil as
unrippled water.

   Kids got in free on the first night of Ringo
Starr's Tour for All Generations but their parents were doing the
screaming for the former Beatle, a grandfather backed by a graying
constellation of rock stars.
   They included former Beatles collaborator Billy Preston, who
played the organ on ``Let it Be;'' spooky Bayou singer Dr. John;
saxman Clarence Clemons and guitarist-keyboardist Nils Lofgren, on
loan from Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band; and volume-cranking
guitarist Joe Walsh, a former Eagle.
   Ringo opened the first show of his 30-city tour stage front and
center Sunday night, singing ``It Don't Come Easy.'' After his
third vocal on ``Yellow Submarine,'' the 49-year-old retired to the
rhythm section.
   Banging the drums rapidly along with Ringo were Jim Keltner, who
played for John Lennon and George Harrison on their solo efforts,
and Levon Helm, drummer for The Band. Fellow Band member Rick Danko
provided the bass line.
   The audience for Ringo's first-ever solo concert was dominated
by thirty- and forty-somethings, including one woman who brought
her two young daughters to show them what the fuss was about.
   ``My kids don't even know who Ringo Starr is, but they will
after tonight,'' she said.
   The concert's promoters boosted the family theme by giving free
admission to children 12 and under accompanied by adults.
   Starr was wearing a star-trimmed jacket in his first public
appearance since a 1986 guest role with the Beach Boys in
Washington, D.C.
   Though he has released nine solo albums since 1970, Starr hasn't
toured since the Beatles split.
   A legendary drinker, he told USA Today that he and wife Barbara
Bach dried out last year at a Tucson rehabilitation center.
   Sober, he felt restless, and channeled his musical drive into a
plan he first hatched in 1978 _ assembling a cast of ``All-Starrs''
with himself in charge.
   ``I am the boss,'' Starr told the newspaper in an interview
published Friday. ``The big boss!''
   Guitarist Walsh interjected, ``The rest of us are little
bosses.''

<HEAD>Students Demand Release of Burmese Opposition Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 60 Burmese students waved banners
and chanted slogans outside their country's embassy in Bangkok
today to demand that Burma release two arrested leaders of the top
opposition group.
   It has been difficult to determine what is happening in Burma
because telephone and telex lines have been cut most of the time
since Wednesday, when hundreds of students defied martial law with
anti-government protests. Burma's official radio reported 44
arrests during those protests in Rangoon, the capital.
   Diplomats in Bangkok believe Burmese authorities are trying to
limit foreign reporting on their domestic strife.
   The military government of Burma placed Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin
Oo, who lead the National League for Democracy, under house arrest
on Thursday.
   The two were accused of trying to ``destroy the military and
revive anarchy,'' even though Ms. Suu Kyi had canceled a major
rally planned for Wednesday.
   In addition, British authorities have expressed concern over the
whereabouts of Michael Aris, Ms. Suu Kyi's British husband. He flew
to Burma's capital, Rangoon, on Saturday.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said Aris was not permitted
to see a British diplomat who had waited for him at the airport.
Aris may also be under house arrest, the spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   In the Bangkok protest, Burmese students carried banners
denouncing military rule and waved a ``fighting peacock'' flag
while chanting slogans of last year's thwarted popular Burmese
uprising for democracy.
   The fighting peacock was the symbol of Burma's battle for
independence from British colonial rule.
   ``We denounce the arrests and demand the immediate release of
Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo,'' said 24-year-old Moe Thee Zun, who
until April headed the largest student party in Burma. He fled
after a wave of arrests of opposition activists.
   Gen. Saw Maung seized power in Burma in September and his troops
crushed dissent by killing hundreds of people. Millions of people
protested nationwide last year to demand an end to a quarter
century of military control of the government.
   ``The more oppressive the government becomes, the more turmoil
it will cause, and it may lead to a civil war in Burma,'' said Htun
Aung Gyaw, chairman of the All Burma Students Democratic Front. The
group is a Burmese dissident organization operating on the Thai
border.

<HEAD>DC-9 Makes Emergency Landing; No One Hurt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Airlines DC-9 with 27 people
aboard made an emergency landing early today with no traffic
controllers in the airport tower and with its primary electrical
system down. No one was injured.
   It was the second jetliner forced to make an emergency landing
in Iowa in less than a week.
   The pilot switched to his backup electrical system and the
jetliner, en route from Chicago to Portland, Ore., landed safely,
an American spokesman said.
   Police and fire units were standing by at the Waterloo Municipal
Airport, but were not needed. The plane, Flight 639, landed just
after midnight, said Hagan Gibbs, area supervisor for the Waterloo
tower.
   Hagan said the Waterloo tower is staffed only until 11 p.m. and
no air traffic controllers were on duty at the time of the landing.
He said regional controllers handled the emergency landing.
   On Wednesday, a United Airlines DC-10 lost power over northwest
Iowa and crashed while attempting an emergency landing at the Sioux
City airport, killing 110 people.
   John Hotard, an American spokesman in Fort Worth, Texas, said
the backup system allows the plane's electrical systems to function
normally. The electrical system does not affect the aircraft's
steering mechanism, which are controlled by hydraulic lines, he
said. There were hydraulic problems in the Sioux City landing.
   ``Once he had a problem, the pilot immediately goes to air
traffic control and declares an emergency,'' Hotard said. ``At that
point, they direct him to the nearest airport.''
   The backup system kicked in immediately after the primary system
failed, Hotard said. Because the pilot did not have a second backup
system, he chose to land the plane.
   ``It's a precautionary move,'' Hotard said. ``You don't want to
be flying without a backup.''

<TEXT>
   A woman who was jailed for six days
for refusing to testify against a man charged with raping her says
she's angrier at the legal system than at her alleged attacker.
   The 22-year-old woman _ who said she ignored court summonses
because she didn't want to relive the assault _ said her arrest at
first seemed like a second kidnapping and she was frightened when
her lawyer couldn't seem to get her freed.
   ``I thought I was never getting out,'' the woman told the Miami
Herald in an interview from California that was published over the
weekend.
   ``It was like, `I can't believe this is happening to me,''' she
said. ``... I'm just very angry, more at the system than at my
attacker.''
   The woman was jailed June 15 after Broward County Circuit Judge
Mark Speiser ordered her arrested and brought to court so he could
ask her if she was willing to testify against Steven L. Lord, 26,
an unemployed mechanic.
   Lord is charged with armed sexual battery and armed kidnapping
in an assault on the woman, who was kidnapped from a restaurant
parking lot and assaulted Nov. 6.
   When the woman finally was brought into court June 20, the judge
scolded her.
   ``It disturbs me that, since you are the victim of this crime,
that you have totally ignored your obligation to appear in court
and appear for depositions,'' Speiser said.
   She was freed that day after agreeing to testify at the trial,
which is scheduled to begin Aug. 21.
   The judge said he didn't intend that the woman be jailed.
Deputies who arrested her were supposed to bring her straight to
court, he said.
   ``I had no idea when they picked her up,'' Speiser told the
Herald last week. ``Why they didn't bring her to me, I don't know.''
   But those weren't the orders jailers got from the judge, said
Maj. Willie Roberts, a jail director. He read from a computer
print-out of directions to jailers: ``Subject is to be remanded
into custody of Broward County Jail until she can be brought before
Judge Speiser _ no bond.''

   About 40 Zairean students padlocked the gates of
their embassy today and blocked staff from entering to protest
their government's failure to provide living subsidies and plane
tickets home.
   The students have staged a sit-in on embassy grounds for a week,
but said officials have offered no solution.
   Today, they padlocked the embassy gates and barricaded them with
tables, leaving Chinese staff standing bewildered outside.
   One student said Zaire's military attache drove up in a car but
the students refused to let him in.
   Theo Bitufuila, 26, who recently graduated from the Chinese
Traditional Medicine College in Shanghai, said his government
agreed to give students in China about $90 for monthly living
expenses.
   ``It hasn't paid in 23 months,'' he said, speaking through the
compound's iron gates. Zaire now has 89 students in China, most
pursuing undergraduate degrees in the sciences.
   They have been living on about $67 a month paid by the Chinese
government, but many also have borrowed from their schools and are
under pressure to repay the debts, the students said.
   Bitufuila and other recent graduates said their government also
has failed to provide plane tickets home. ``The agreement is that
China pays the tickets out and our government pays them back,'' he
said.
   Ambassador Lombo Lomangamanga, who met with students Saturday,
refused to comment.
   ``We have written letters for a long time now, not only to him
but to (the government in) Zaire, and there is no answer,'' said
Manu Kapapa, 29, who just graduated from Shanghai's China
University of Chemical Technology. Zairean students in other
countries also complain they have not received stipends.
   The Zaireans are one of the largest groups out of 1,500 Africans
studying under Chinese scholarships this year.
   Their presence has triggered racial conflicts in the past as in
December, when African and Chinese students clashed in the eastern
city of Nanjing after Africans brought Chinese women to a school
dance. Before the week of clashes ended, thousands of Chinese
marched through the streets shouting, ``Kill the black devils.''
   Senegal sent its 18 students home, but students from Ghana and
Mali complained their governments would not let them leave.

<HEAD>President Appeals to Senators to Keep Defense Budget Intact</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: New material with Bush remarks, editing throughout.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, defending the
half-billion-dollar B-2 Stealth bomber and saying the Star Wars
missile defense system is critical, appealed today to senators to
keep his defense budget intact.
   The president, meeting with members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and other leading senators, also said an espionage
investigation at the State Department doesn't help U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   Bush said the B-2 and the Strategic Defense Initiative, both of
which are threatened with deep cuts on Capitol Hill, are essential
to the U.S. defense and to arms talks with the Soviets.
   ``I strongly support what we sent up there to the Hill. SDI, in
my view, is critical,'' said Bush.
   The B-2, he added, ``is a revolutionary plane with revolutionary
technology. Again I would strongly urge your support for that.'' He
also appealed for support for funds for the Midgetman missile and
for making the MX missile mobile.
   ``We need the utmost flexibility in terms of arms control,''
said Bush.
   Asked by reporters how he could justify the expense of the B-2,
costing $70 billion for 132 planes, or $530 million apiece, Bush
replied, ``I justify it because I think the prime responsibility of
the president is the national security of the United States.''
   Asked about the investigation of top State Department official
Felix Bloch as a possible Soviet spy, Bush said it ``is a very
serious matter and it will be thoroughly investigated.''
   ``The minute I heard about it I was aggrieved because it is a
very tragic thing should these allegations be true,'' said Bush.
   Asked what impact it might have on U.S.-Soviet relations, Bush
said, ``It doesn't help any. ... Espionage goes on. I don't think
it helps when you have high-visibility cases. but I think
regrettably it says more, if it's true, about an individual who is
alleged to have passed secrets to the Soviets, which is very bad.''
   Bush said he was not sure how seriously U.S. security may have
been compromised. Bloch was the No. 2 official at the U.S. embassy
in Vienna.
   On Sunday, Bush's budget chief said the president has ruled out
any suggestion from Democrats that he accept future tax increases
in exchange for an immediate cut in the capital gains tax.
   Bush, kicking off the week with an unusually hectic schedule,
also planned to meet with South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Ho
Joong.
   Another White House visitor was Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley,
son and namesake of the city's legendary mayor. And Bush was
meeting with Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.
   Bush has been negotiating with House Speaker Thomas Foley and
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the Ways and Means chairman, on a
revenue package.
   White House budget director Richard Darman said Sunday, ``We
believe that right now, we have the votes for a satisfactory
capital gains proposal in the Ways and Means Committee. Our only
problem is ... (House Speaker Thomas F. Foley and committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski) won't actually bring it up for a vote.''
   Darman said the president was not willing to agree to exchange a
lower capital gains levy now for increases in other taxes next year
or later.
   ``The president is firmly committed to his pledge not to raise
taxes,'' Darman said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   Asked how long Bush intended to stick by his no-tax-increase
pledge, Darman said, ``For the time being, let's assume forever _
but I don't know exactly what that means.''
   The Democratic leaders contend lowering the capital gains rate _
now 28 to 33 percent _ would hurt the Treasury and help only the
wealthy.
   Darman said it would stimulate growth and raise Treasury
revenues.

   It's not exactly Disneyland, but a new
jail and its robot food carts have become so popular with families
that a baffled sheriff decided to schedule more tours this week.
   ``We've had people with cameras and video cameras. It's amazing
to me,'' said Sheriff's Sgt. Harvey Lewis, who organized the tours
of the state-of-the- art facility.
   The $174 million Alameda County jail, about 25 miles east of San
Francisco, will be the sixth-largest county jail in the nation when
it opens in September. Plummer and his deputies were amazed when
more than 6,000 people showed up for free tours offered during two
weeks last month.
   About 2,500 showed up for the first Saturday tour _ more than
the number who tour the former federal prison on Alcatraz on an
average day.
   ``It may be a little like why people like to watch horror
movies. It's the unknown,'' said Sheriff Charles Plummer.
   Most of the visitors are families with children, senior groups
and scout troops.
   The new jail's biggest draw is its high-tech robot carts, which
will deliver food and linens throughout the compound.
   ``That's what we wanted to see, the little robots running
around,'' said Jim Sparano, 17. ``What's really amazing is that the
prisoners deserve so much. I figured it would be like old jail bars
and cells. It looks like a hotel.''

<TEXT>
   Newly released court documents show that an
expelled Danish woman was suspected of planning an attack in
Israel, but she has denied the charges and her lawyer was quoted
today as saying she would sue Israel.
   Authorities expelled 25-year-old Ulla Lyngsby on July 14. She
had been questioned for 90 minutes upon her arrival in Israel on
July 6 and arrested two days later in the northern city of Haifa.
   Details of the case were censorsed until Sunday, when a Haifa
court released a document from her bail hearing on July 10 in
response to a request from Israeli journalists.
   The document included charges she was linked to Force 17, a
military arm of Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. It said she planned to carry out attacks
on Israeli nationals.
   The document said the accusation was contained in material
provided by Israeli agents who investigated her. Her boyfriend,
Jihad Mishlawi, a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon, was identified
as the deputy chief of Force 17 in the documents.
   The Maariv daily newspaper said Ms. Lyngsby was sent by Force 17
to carry out a massacre at the closing ceremony of the Maccabiah
Games for Jewish athletes on July 13.
   The story said she also intended to assassinate the chief rabbi
of Denmark. He was to attend the ceremony at Jerusalem's Wailing
Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
   The charges reported by the paper did not appear in the court
documents released Sunday. Police said they could not comment
because the Shin Bet secret police had conducted the investigation.
   In the confession, Ms. Lyngsby admitted helping to obtain travel
itineraries of the chief rabbi and newspaper editor Herbert Pundik
for suspected attacks when they visited Israel.
   In Copenhagen, Denmark, the daily Berlingske Tidende quoted Ms.
Lyngsby's lawyer, Joergen Jacobsen, as saying she will sue Israeli
authorities for a ``symbolic'' sum of $4,730.
   Following her expulsion, she claimed she signed the confession
under duress in an effort to win her release. She said it was
written in Hebrew, a language she does not understand.
   The newspaper quoted her lawyer as saying she was never informed
of the charges against her.
   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter of Denmark said Friday that
authorities ``knew with certainty'' that a group of people in that
country were involved in assassination plans against Danish
citizens connected with Israel. He gave no specifics.
   He said no Danish charges would be pressed against Ms. Lyngsby.
But Denmark's foreign minister said it found no reason to protest
her arrest or expulsion.
   The daily Politiken in Copenhagen quoted the PLO Information
Office in that city as saying Force 17 had never been involved in
terrorism. The group said it had no knowledge of any plot to kill
the chief rabbi or other Danish Jews.

   Rebecca Schaeffer, the actress allegedly
killed by a fan who stalked her, was buried in her hometown before
mourners that included her ``My Sister Sam'' television co-stars.
   About 250 people attended the funeral Sunday for the 21-year-old
actress, who was shot to death Tuesday at the door to her Los
Angeles apartment building.
   Robert John Bardo _ described as an obsessive fan of the actress
who appears in the current movie, ``Scenes from the Class Struggle
in Beverly Hills'' _ was arrested in Tucson, Ariz., a day later and
charged with the murder. Authorities say he sent numerous letters
to Miss Schaeffer.
   Among the 250 mourners at Ahavia Shalom Cemetery were Pam
Dawber, Joel Brooks and Jenny O'Hara from the television series,
which ran from 1986 through 1988. Miss Dawber was accompanied by
her husband, film actor Mark Harmon.
   At the service, friends read from Miss Schaeffer's writing. One
friend, Brad Silberling, said he wanted to marry Schaeffer.
   He sobbed as he told mourners, ``She always said, `I want you to
hold me so close.' Please, hold her `so close' in your hearts.''
   Rabbi Emanuel Rose told Miss Schaeffer's parents, Benson and
Danna Schaeffer, that they should not be angry at the killer.
   ``Our experience, over the long run, cannot be one of anger,''
Rose said. ``Anger gets us nowhere.''
   Miss Schaeffer's casket was adorned with a spray of white, blue
and mauve flowers gathered with a mauve ribbon.
   Copies of poems and thoughts she had written, bound in ith blue
or mauve ribbon, were circulated among family members. She wrote of
a search for wisdom and love and of being touched by others' lives,
``to be inspired by the inspired.''
   Born in Eugene, Ore., Miss Schaeffer began modeling in Portland
at age 14. She left home at 16 to try for a career in New York.
   At 19, she won the role of Patti Russell in ``My Sister Sam.''
   She had just finished filming ``One Point of View,'' a feature
film directed by Dyan Cannon.

   Shrimpers who ended their blockade of
ship channels along the Texas coast say they will renew their
protest if officials don't address their concerns about costly new
devices meant to protect sea turtles.
   The shrimpers lifted anchors and yielded to traffic in the ship
channels Sunday, but hundreds waited nearby today as their
representatives prepared for a requested meeting with national
fisheries officials.
   ``If something is not done, there'll be shrimpers in all of
these channels and there'll probably be violence,'' Marvin Hickman,
a shrimper from Tarpon Springs, Fla., said Sunday. ``The tempers
are running very high out there.''
   About 200 shrimp boats on Saturday crowded the deep-water
Houston ship channel, which passes between Galveston Island and
Bolivar Peninsula, and about 300 shrimpers jammed Port Aransas,
gateway to the Port of Corpus Christi.
   Similar blockades in smaller Texas and Louisiana ports also
ended Sunday. Two recreational boaters were hospitalized briefly
for minor injuries after trying to run the blockade Saturday in
Cameron, La.
   Gunfire was reported in both states and four shrimpers were
arrested in Texas. There were no injuries, officials said.
   Coast Guard Adm. William F. Merlin, commander of the 8th Coast
Guard District in New Orleans, met with shrimpers' representatives
Sunday. A meeting between shrimpers, Coast Guard officials,
representatives of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration
and the National Marine Fisheries Service was scheduled for this
afternoon.
   The Coast Guard said U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
agreed to a meeting with Texas and Louisiana congressional leaders
in Washington.
   A Commerce Department spokesman could not be reached.
   Shrimpers were protesting new Commerce Department regulations
requiring that they use devices intended to protect endangered
Kemp's Ridley sea turtles.
   The devices are designed to allow the turtles to escape
shrimpers' nets, but the shrimpers complain that they let shrimp
out too and are bulky, dangerous and expensive to operate. The
devices cost from $60 to several hundred dollars.
   Tee John Mialjevich, president of the Concerned Shrimpers of
America, said he would propose an alternative requirement that
shrimpers perform tows no longer than 90 minutes. He said that by
checking nets more often, they could avoid killing turtles and not
lose shrimp.
   He and other shrimpers warned that the blockades would return by
Tuesday if their concerns are not addressed.
   Many of the shrimpers went ashore for a symbolic burning of the
turtle protection devices. They vowed not to use them despite
potential fines of $8,000 to $25,000 and six months in jail.
   The Coast Guard said more than 50 ships were unable to pass
through Texas channels during the weekend because of the protests.
The Galveston-Bolivar ferry also was halted for several hours
Saturday.

   A Continental Airlines jet flying from
Newark, N.J., to the Dominican Republic made an unscheduled stop in
Orlando after the pilot detected a small leak in the hydraulic
system, an airline spokesman said.
   The 133 passengers aboard the Boeing 727 were never in any
danger, and Flight 431 landed safely at Orlando International
Airport shortly before noon Sunday, Continental spokesman Ned
Walker said.
   The unscheduled landing was not declared an emergency, said
airport spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell.
   The system that developed the small leak helps control the wing
flaps and landing gear. Walker said three backup systems were
intact.
   He said the mishap did not resemble the complete hydraulic
system failure that caused a United Airlines DC-10 to crash
Wednesday in Sioux City, Iowa. The crash killed 111 people.

<HEAD>Radio Station Seized in Coup Claim, But Government Asserts Control</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Six armed men took over a
state-run radio station today and announced the government's
overthrow, but authorities quickly denied that a coup had occurred
and asserted they were in control.
   Apart from the seizure of the radio station, there were no
reports of violence. No injuries were reported at the station.
   In Antananarivo, the capital of this island off East Africa,
people went about their business as usual. The nation has about 10
million people.
   The armed men took over the station of Madagascar national radio
early today and broadcast a statement claiming the government of
President Didier Ratsiraka had been replaced. It said the country
was now being ruled by a group of opposition political leaders.
   Ratsiraka was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, attending a summit of
the Organization of African Unity. It was not immediately possible
to determine if he intended to remain there.
   Two hours after the men seized the station, Information Minister
Simon Pierre broadcast a government message on national radio. He
denied that a coup had taken place and called for calm.
   That message, which was broadcast several times during the
morning, said an investigation was under way but provided no other
details.
   A later newscast said one of the armed men had been identified,
but that the other men had worn masks. It was not immediately known
if the men had been arrested.
   In April, three people died and about 73 were injured in clashes
with police after Ratsiraka's re-election.
   Opposition leaders said the elections were riddled with fraud
and called for the formation of a provisional government. They said
it should include representatives of the military, students and
churches and should yield power after new elections.
   Ratsiraka, initially chosen to rule by the military in 1975, was
re-elected to a third seven-year term on March 12 with about 62
percent of the vote.

<HEAD>Justice Department Has No Plans to Prosecute Demery</HEAD>

   The Justice Department has no current plans to
prosecute a former HUD official criticized for awarding millions of
dollars in subsidies to developers who had contributed to a charity
he helped found, a congressman disclosed today.
   ``Should you come to obtain information not contained in your
report implicating Mr. (Thomas) Demery or other HUD officials in
possible criminal violations we would be happy to review that
information,'' Gerald E. McDowell, chief of the department's public
integrity section, said in a letter to agency officials.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., released the letter as a House
subcommittee resumed hearings into mismanagement and
influence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan administration. He also
charged that many witnesses during the hearings appeared to have
committed perjury and that the Justice Department should conduct
its own investigations instead of relying on Congress or HUD to
refer cases for investigation.
   Frank did not name the witnesses to whom he was referring.
   In the letter, dated July 19, the Justice Department told HUD
Inspector General Paul Adams it would not prosecute former HUD
Assistant Secretary Thomas Demery in connection with an inspector
general's report criticizing the selection process HUD used to
award rent subsidies to developers who promised to renovate housing
for low-income people.
   In the inspector general's report, Adams and his investigators
said many of the developers who received subsidies had been major
contributors to FOOD for Africa, a Michigan-based charity that
Demery helped establish.
   Frank did not criticize the department's decision on Demery but
complained Justice Department officials had indicated they would
not conduct their own investigations into the emerging HUD scandals.
   The first witness at today's hearing was William Taylor, a
member of the Republican National Committee and former chairman of
the Florida State Republican Party. Taylor was criticized by
committee members but defended his use of his RNC stationery in
letters to HUD officials lobbying for HUD projects.
   ``I find nothing wrong with letting people know who I am,'' said
Taylor. He said his lobbying business included numerous HUD-related
clients.
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported today that federal
housing officials approved more than $16 million in rent subsidies
for a Denver housing project after Joseph Coors, the wealthy
Colorado brewer and a friend of President Reagan, wrote a letter
endorsing the project.
   The committee also was scheduled to hear testimony from Lynda
Murphy, a former career HUD employee, about her dealings with her
friend, Deborah Gore Dean, former executive assistant to
then-Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   Ms. Murphy, who left HUD in 1982, was an attorney for DRG
Funding Corp., a lender which has been indefinitely suspended from
doing business with the department because of a high incidence of
loan defaults.
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said the panel is
seeking to use other witnesses to find out about the role of Ms.
Dean, who has refused to testify based on her constitutional right
against self-incrimination.
   ``Miss Dean has chosen to take the Fifth Amendment, and we very
much hope that she will change her mind,'' Lantos said in an
interview. ``So we will attempt to ascertain through these other
witnesses to what extent she was calling the shots and to what
extent it was Secretary Pierce.''
   Pierce himself has said that he was not involved in many of the
day-to-day decisions at the department and testified that he did
not personally order funding for any project.
   However, those statements were contradicted by a later witness,
Shirley McVay Wiseman. Pierce is to appear before the panel again
in August and September.
   Lantos has said the panel is not considering granting legal
immunity for Ms. Dean under which her testimony could not be used
against her in any future prosecution.
   A number of witnesses before the subcommittee have said that Ms.
Dean's support for a project was crucial in any attempt to get
money from HUD.
   Big-name Republicans, such as former Interior Secretary James
Watt, or former high-ranking HUD employees used their contacts to
obtain the funding.
   The Times report said Coors' endorsement two years ago came as
the Denver request appeared headed for rejection. The paper based
its report on internal government documents.
   It also quoted Demery as saying a HUD selection committee was
told that Pierce wanted the Denver application given ``very careful
consideration, which it was.''
   Documents showed the Denver proposal was originally left off a
list of 1987 applications to be recommended for financing, the
Times said.
   On Aug. 12, 1987, Coors wrote Pierce urging him to ``look into
this matter and give it your favorable approval.'' One week after
the letter was written, the selection panel met in Washington and
approved the Denver request, the Times said documents showed.
   The Times said there was no indication that Coors had a
financial interest in the project, characterizing his support for
it instead as being motivated by civic pride.

<HEAD>Abkhazia Unrest Spills into Soviet Georgian Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic unrest in Soviet Georgia spilled into the
republic's capital today, with hundreds of protesters marching
through the streets and bus traffic disrupted, according to
witnesses and official reports.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the national legislature the unrest in
the Black Sea enclave of Abkhazia spread to Tbilisi, causing ``the
disorganization of transportation'' this morning, apparently
because of a strike.
   The Soviet president said ``the situation became acute'' in the
city in the Caucusus mountains, about 1,050 miles south of Moscow.
   The protest follows clashes between Georgians and Abkhazians in
the Georgia-ruled enclave of Abkhazia, a popular seaside vacation
area about 170 miles west of Tbilisi. Since the violence began July
15, 19 people have been reported killed and more than 400 injured.
   An editorial assistant at the Georgian news agency Gruzinform
said buses failed to appear in some areas of Tbilisi this morning
but were running by midday.
   The interruption of bus service appeared linked to a railway
strike that began over the weekend and ended today, the official
Tass news agency reported. The walkout stranded thousands of
tourists.
   Besides the transit strike, several hundred people demonstrated
throughout the day in central Tbilisi ``against what happened in
Abkhazia,'' the editor, Nana Gelashvili, said in a telephone
interview.
   ``When those Abkhazians started to knife Georgians, it just
drove us out of our minds,'' she said.
   No armed clashes have been reported in the area for the past two
days, Tass reported, although internal security troops and police
continued to confiscate weapons from extremists.
   Activists in Tbilisi proposed a general strike for today to
protest what they called a failure by authorities to protect
Georgians in Abkhazia.
   As a result of the violence, two regional party secretaries were
fired and two government leaders in Abkhazia lost their jobs
Saturday.
   Abkhazians and Georgians blame each other for the ethnic unrest.
Abkhazians, who are a minority in their own region, want greater
economic independence and cultural rights, while Georgians want the
fertile enclave retained as part of their Caucasus republic.
   Georgian leaders want to develop a dialogue over problems in the
region, but Abkhazians want the Kremlin to establish an outside
body to take control, news reports say.
   Protesters today called for resolution of the question of
Abkhazia's status and an end to the violence, Gelashvili said.
   At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past
month in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.

   The United Airlines DC-10 crash claimed
its 106th victim today, while investigators using infrared cameras
searched cornfields 60 miles from the crash site for pieces of the
plane's rear engine.
   Brent Bealer of Quakertown, Pa., died early today from injuries
he suffered in Wednesday's crash, said Rhonda Ostrihonsky, a
spokeswoman for St. Luke's Medical Center.
   Thirty-two others remain hospitalized and five people are still
listed as missing.
   At Sioux Gateway Airport, officials on Sunday were painstakingly
reassembling the tail section of Flight 232 in hopes of determining
what caused the jet to lose hydraulic power and tumble out of
control across the runway. In Denver, meanwhile, a United official
told about 200 people at a service for survivors and victims that
it was time for healing after Wednesday's crash.
   ``There is little to say to ease the sadness. We at United feel
deeply your pain and loss. We have lost members of the United
family. And we offer thanks for those who were spared,'' said Capt.
William Traub, United's vice president of flight standards in
Denver.
   Authorities were beginning to return home the bodies of crash
victims. A spokesman for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said more than 20
bodies had been sent home by Sunday.
   According to a list compiled with information from United,
relatives and employers, 106 people were confirmed dead and five
were still listed as missing. Another 185 passengers survived the
crash, United said.
   Jim Burnett, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said farmers in a 16-square-mile section about 60 miles
northeast of the crash site were being asked to look for parts,
including the missing engine fan.
   Nebraska Air National Guard jets photographed those fields with
infrared cameras in a search for metal fragments thrown from the
engine when it exploded.
   Burnett said the search had been hampered because some pieces
apparently fell in areas where corn is up to 6 feet high.
   ``We basically plan on being alert. We're concerned about our
machines getting a flat tire and so forth,'' said Tim Anderson, on
whose farm several pieces of the plane fell.
   In a separate development, Burnett said he would ask the NTSB to
look at the issue of child safety in aviation accidents, including
whether special child safety seats should be used on airplanes,
according to today's editions of The New York Times.
   If child safety seats are required, infants who now sit on laps
and fly free would need their own seats, which could make family
travel more expensive. An unusually large number of children were
aboard the flight in part because airlines offer free tickets to
children flying with adults on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
   At least one infant died in the crash, United said. A list
compiled by The Associated Press shows 24 children under 10 years
old, including seven under 5, were among the survivors.
   Investigators continued to interview crew members, meanwhile.
   The flight engineer said that immediately after the explosion in
the No. 2 engine, the gauges indicated the immediate loss of fluid
in all three hydraulic systems, according to Burnett.
   Without the hydraulic systems, the DC-10 is almost impossible to
fly.
   Investigators also said they checked maintenance records on key
sections of the engine.
   ``There's nothing here that gives us cause for concern at this
point,'' said Burnett. ``Although I will say that previous
accidents have led to reductions in cycles. So it's not to say that
this is irrelevant.''
   The age of engine parts is expressed in cycles, or one landing
and takeoff.
   NTSB officials said they hoped to end their on-site
investigation by midweek. Other investigators gathered personal
items of passengers, stowing them in a hangar to be claimed later.
   ``We are taking great pains to collect everything we can,
identify them and return them,'' said United spokesman James
Guyette. He said United would assign specially trained workers and
give personal phone numbers to families of those who died.
   Doctors said they were working to stabilize crash victims and
allow them to move close to their homes.
   ``We're moving them home as soon as they're physically capable
of the trip,'' said Larry Foster, head of the burn unit at St.
Luke's Regional Medical Center. Full recovery would take much time
for some, he said.
   While most burn victims departed this northwestern Iowa city as
soon as they were able, some stayed put.
   ``I could leave tomorrow if I wanted to,'' said Helen Hayes, a
burn victim from Denver. ``I really don't feel like traveling for a
while.''

<HEAD>Israel Court Says Government Must Recognize Jewish Conversions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 4 grafs of comment from U.S. groups.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court ruled today that the
government must recognize Jewish conversions conducted abroad by
Reform and Conservative rabbis, deciding an issue that has put many
U.S. Jews at odds with Israel.
   The 4-1 decision immediately caused friction in Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet, where religious parties protested and one
faction threatened to resign.
   In a second decision, the court unanimously rejected an appeal
to allow Reform rabbis to perform marriages in Israel. That
decision upheld an Orthodox monopoly on conducting religious
weddings.
   Both of today's rulings were linked to the issue of ``Who is a
Jew?'' Israeli Orthodox Jews have sought to narrow that definition
under the Law of Return.
   The law now permits granting Israeli citizenship to anyone born
of a Jewish mother or who has converted to Judaism and does not
belong to another faith.
   The Orthodox want the definition to include only Jews born to
Jewish mothers or converted according to Jewish law known as
Halacha, which would effectively mean by Orthodox rabbis.
   The change has been fought by Conservative and Reform rabbis,
whose followers constitute a majority of more than 5 million U.S.
Jews but who have few adherents in Israel.
   The Reform and Conservative Jews contend the Orthodox proposal
would symbolically excommunicate them from Judaism and alienate
U.S. Jews from Israel.
   Rabbis estimate there are more than 10,000 conversions a year in
the United States, nearly all non-Orthodox.
   The Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Meir Shamgar, made
today's decision in a ruling on appeals by 12 U.S. immigrants and
one from Brazil. They were denied Israeli citizenship papers by the
Interior Ministry, which is controlled by the ultra-Orthodox Shas
Party.
   The court's 17-page ruling said a 1965 Israeli law did not
entitle the government to decide the validity of conversions by
different Jewish groups.
   Religious Affairs Minister Zevulun Hammer reacted to the ruling
by pledging to renew a political campaign for a narrower definition
of who is a Jew, Israel radio reported.
   Menachem Porush, a legislator of the ultra-Orthodox Agudat
Israel faction, said his party may withdraw its support from
Shamir's Cabinet. Such a move could sway other religious parties to
take similar actions.
   ``We have a secular court interfering in a religious subject. We
must view this very seriously,'' Porush told The Associated Press.
   Agudat is participating in the government for the first time. It
has traditionally refused to do so to avoid dealing in secular
affairs.
   The party holds five seats in the 120-seat Parliament. Its
executive council scheduled a meeting for later today to discuss
the issue.
   Gail Moskowitz, one of the U.S. immigrants in the court case,
said: ``I have been waiting for this for 2{ years. That's a long
time to not know where you stand. Now I know where I stand: on my
own feet and I'm Jewish.''
   ``I believe it is important to separate the issue of church and
state,'' said Elissa Ben-Rafael, a plaintiff from Chicago. She
joined the suit even though she was converted by an Orthodox rabbi.
   The marriage ruling came on appeals made seven years ago by the
Israeli Reform Judaism Movement; Israeli rabbi Mordechai Rotem; and
a rabbi from Baltimore, Moshe Zemer.
   In the 97-page decision, the justices upheld three laws which
effectively give Israel's Orthodox rabbis exclusive rights to
decide who may preside at marriages.
   Spokesman for several U.S. groups said they were pleased by the
decision on conversions.
   ``We believe that the court's action helps to preserve the unity
of the Jewish people so essential to Israel at the present critical
time,'' said George Gruen, director of Israeli and Middle Eastern
affairs for the American Jewish Committee in New York.
   ``I say hallelujah,'' said Carmela Kalmanson, president of
Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization in America with 385,000
members.
   Ms. Kalmanson said that though the numbers of people affected
``may be small, it was the perception that was very hurtful.''

to the Soviet Union left Monday to meet with Kremlin officials on a
proposed joint development of Siberian resources and other economic
cooperation.
   The 37-member private mission, representing construction,
fishery, coal and other industries, was led by Chung Ju-yung,
founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai Group conglomerate.
   During their week-long visit, the South Koreans are to tour
Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Nakhodka and Moscow.
   The Soviet Chamber of Commerce and the state-run Korea Trade
Promotion Corp. this year exchanged trade offices seeking direct
trade and other economic dealings.
   The Soviet Union, which has no diplomatic relations with Seoul,
is interested in using South Korean capital and expertise in
developing natural resources such as natural gas, coal and timber.
   Seoul officials hope economic exchanges between the two
countries will lead to formal relations. Moscow has diplomatic ties
with North Korea.

<HEAD>Report Rushdie, Wife Move From House to House Under Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses''
caused worldwide uproar among Moslems, remains under strict
security and spends only a few weeks in the same house, it was
reported Monday.
   Rushdie and his American wife, Marianne Wiggins, have lived in a
succession of ``safe houses'' since Iran's late religious leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called on Feb. 14 for the author's
death for insulting ``Islamic sanctity,'' The Independent reported.
   The report said the houses are operated by the Special Branch _
a unit of Scotland Yard police headquarters concerned with
political activities _ and MI5, the secret intelligence unit.
   The houses are generally used for spies and intelligence
contacts, the newspaper said.
   On the day of the death threat, the novelist and his wife were
taken from their home in London's Islington district by Special
Branch detectives and have never gone back there together, it said.
   ``Salman is effectively in prison at the moment,'' it quoted
playwright Harold Pinter, a friend of the novelist, as saying.
   The report said Rushdie and his wife have dined with literary
acquaintances and leading political figures, such as opposition
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. Rushdie continues to review books
and is writing a children's book.
   But publishers Secker and Warburg requested no use of
photographs of Ms. Wiggins when they sent out review copies of her
book of short stories, ``Herself in Love,'' to be published this
month.
   Rushdie and his wife ``are now more alone than ever. Literally
no friends, acquaintances, agents or publishers know where they
are. They cannot receive telephone calls, though mail sent through
a tortuous route via police does reach them and they can then
respond to messages. But it is a slow process,'' the newspaper said.
   Security for them costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and
``differs little from that accorded to a head of state ...
Activities like shopping, theater or cinema are out of the
question,'' the report said.
   Ms. Wiggins had to cancel a planned U.S. tour to publicize her
novel, ``John Dollar.''

<HEAD>Aquino Admits Filipinos Still Poor; Teachers Demand Pay Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino told
legislators Monday that most Filipinos remain poor despite economic
gains during her three-year rule.
   In an address to a joint session of the House of Representatives
and Senate, Mrs. Aquino repeated promises to rid her government of
tax cheaters and grafters, and to purge the police and military of
criminals who made the crime situation ``nothing less than
terrible.''
   As she spoke, about 3,000 members of left-wing organizations
marched to protest corruption and alleged foreign control of Mrs.
Aquino's government and economic policies.
   Another group of about 3,000 public school teachers demonstrated
separately to demand salary increases.
   Mrs. Aquino said that despite a 20-year communist insurgency and
at least six coup attempts, her government succeeded in the past
three years in reviving the economy, increasing investment,
reducing unemployment and nibbling away at mass poverty.
   But the recovery ``has restored old fortunes far more
significantly than it has touched the lives of the vast majority''
of more than 55 million Filipinos, Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``Poverty has lessened but 5.3 million households, or 29 million
people, remain poor,'' she said. ``Unemployment has been reduced,
but try telling that to the 2.9 million still jobless and the 7.2
million underemployed.''
   Even the 500,000 families which statistically have crossed the
poverty line _ a monthly income of $119 for a family of six _ feel
nothing has changed, she said. ``I can't blame them: liberty is a
poor substitute for food.''
   She announced measures to help develop the countryside, where
most Filipinos live.
   Mrs. Aquino said she is ``tired of being taken to task'' for
continuing corruption and wants to leave clean and honest
government as her legacy.
   ``To my fellow workers in government specifically involved in
this area and in all other areas as well, let me say that unless
the public sees results soon, it will be good-bye for you,'' she
said. ``The compassion that marked my administration in the past
may generate doubts about my resolve in this matter, but the
actions that will be taken by me in the next weeks and months will
dispel them all.''

   The Army's Safety Center said today it is
investigating the cause of a helicopter crash that killed six
soldiers in the California desert during training exercises.
   ``It will take three to four months for the investigation,''
Col. Herbert Blanks, a spokesman for the safety center at Fort
Rucker, Ala., said in a telephone interview.
   The UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter went down about 4 a.m. Saturday
during a mission 14 miles northeast of Fort Irwin, Calif. Three
officers and three non-commissioned officers died in the crash. A
corporal suffered a broken leg, the Pentagon said.
   All the soldiers involved were from the 1st Cavalry Division
based in Fort Hood, Texas. They were at the 1,000-square-mile base
120 miles northeast of Los Angeles for a three-week training
exercise that ended Saturday.
   Blanks said the crash was the fourth by a UH-60 since October.
There were five such accidents last fiscal year, he said, adding:
``There is no abnormal trend, not when you consider the amount of
hours they fly.''
   The colonel said no repeated structural flaws have been found.
   ``The majority of our accidents are human error,'' he said.
   At the Pentagon, those killed in the crash were identified as
Lt. Col. William C. Whittingstall, 40, Iowa Park, Texas; Capt.
Marlon D. Joseph, 33, Houston; 1st Lt. Robert B. Wilson, 26,
Dumfries, Va.; Chief Warrant Officer 4 Roy A. Westbrook, 42,
Poteet, Texas; Chief Warrant Officer 3 Adelbert L. Morrow, 41,
Hemat, Calif.; and Staff Sgt. Stephen P. Thompson, 28, Sacramento,
Calif.
   The wounded soldier was identified as Scott A. Matthews, 24, of
Corpus Christi, Texas.

<HEAD>Adriatic Region Approves Emergency Funds for Slimy Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Emilia-Romagna region on Monday
approved $17 million in emergency funds to help clean up its
algae-infested coastal waters.
   The money will be used to aid the region's tourism and fishing
industries, devastated by the algae which first appeared in early
July.
   The government recently approved $100 million in emergency aid
for the Adriatic but has yet to implement any measures.
   The algae that has spread along beaches in the Friuli, Veneto,
Marche and Emilia-Romagna regions is moving to the south, news
reports said Monday.
   Officials in the Abruzzo region said the algae spoiled several
beaches over the weekend and hotel operators fear the same tourist
flight that has hurt the resort industry in the north.
   On Sunday, 300 fishing boats tried to increase the Adriatic's
oxygen supply by cruising back and forth to churn up the water.
Despite this effort, fish, crustaceans and mollusks have died from
lack of oxygen caused by the algae.
   Affected are areas of the northern Adriatic from Venice to
Pescara.

<TEXT>
   A man wanted in a fatal shooting in an
Oklahoma flower shop and suspected in five more killings in three
other states was arrested at a hospital emergency room.
   Michael Frank Greene, 37, was arrested Sunday at Comanche County
Memorial Hospital, where he had gone for treatment of a back
injury. He was held today in an Ardmore jail.
   District Attorney Fred Collins said one count of first-degree
murder, two counts of shooting with intent to kill and two counts
of robbery with a firearm were filed against Greene in the
shootings of three women in a flower shop in Ardmore, about 100
miles southeast of Lawton.
   Greene also is a suspect in the killing of a photo processing
shop owner in Pampa, Texas, and the killings of two convenience
store clerks in Garden City, Kan., said Carter County District
Attorney Gary Henry.
   ``There is physical evidence linking all of the murders,'' said
police Capt. Ron Rardin of Garden City. ``I can't say much more
than that, but the evidence points that way.''
   Capt. Stan Wojdylak of the Garden City Police Department said
this morning, however, that officers were en route to Raton, N.M.,
to question a suspect in a shooting there. Ardmore detectives also
were en route to New Mexico.
   ``The Garden City Police Department has never really formally
said the suspect in custody (in Oklahoma) was responsible for the
shootings here in Garden City. There was a shooting overnight in
New Mexico, and we have officers en route there now,'' Wojdylak
said.
   Henry said the slayings were ``within a day's drive and occurred
on three successive days and the manner of the killing and the ...
weapon used appears similar.''
   Meanwhile, in Merrillville, Ind., police said the slayings of
two motel clerks earlier this year may be related to the killings
in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
   Investigators with the Jasper County, Ind., sheriff's office on
Sunday told The Daily Oklahoman in Oklahoma City that new leads in
the March 3 deaths led them to Greene as a suspect. They did not
elaborate.
   Indiana and Kansas investigators have tentatively set a meeting
next week to discuss the killings in both states, which are
``strikingly similar,'' said Capt. Bob Hicks of the Jasper County
sheriff's office in Indiana.
   In the slayings in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, all four victims
were shot in the back of the head, said Les Weaver, a Texas highway
patrol dispatcher.
   The killings started early Wednesday in Garden City, when
Barbara Kochendorfer, 27, and Mary Rains, 28, were abducted from
convenience stores on opposite sides of the western Kansas city.
Their bodies were found hours later.
   On Thursday, Edley Perry Spurrier was found dead in the photo
processing shop he ran in Pampa, in the Texas panhandle.
   In Ardmore, Gwen Miller was killed Friday and two other women
were wounded. Police speculated the shootings occurred during a
robbery.
   Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham said one of the
survivors of the Oklahoma shootings, Joann Bean, identified Greene
from photographs as the man who shot her, Miller and Mary Manning.
   Ms. Bean was listed in good condition Sunday at an Oklahoma City
hospital, while Ms. Manning was in serious but stable condition at
another Oklahoma City hospital.
   Dr. Scott Malowney, the Ardmore medical examiner, said the
shootings were ``almost ritualistic'' and ``more like an
assassination than a shooting.''
   Officials said ``less than $100'' was taken from the flower shop.
   Authorities said a tip led them to Greene at the hospital in
Lawton, which is about 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City.
   Greene's father, Hank, of Inola, Okla., said his son has been
married twice, has five children, and moved to Inola about a year
ago. He said his son's wife recently filed for divorce and moved
the family to Pampa, Texas, where her parents live.
   Hank Greene said he was glad his son had been caught.
   ``At least I know there isn't going to be anymore stuff going on
by him ... God in heaven, I would have bet my life he didn't do
it,'' he said Sunday after learning of his son's arrest.
   ``I hung on by a thin thread he wasn't implicated in it. I've
never experienced anything like this with that much terrible
hurt,'' he said. ``It was all uncalled for. He wasn't raised like
that.''
   Michael Greene's prior criminal history includes 1984 bogus
check conviction and a 1977 forgery conviction, Collins said.

   President Bush said today that reports a
former top diplomat in Vienna may have spied for the Soviets are
``very serious,'' but he does not have an assessment of potential
damage to the United States.
   ``I have known about this matter for some time and the minute I
heard about it I was aggrieved because it is a very tragic thing
should the allegations be true,'' Bush told reporters in commenting
for the first time on Felix S. Bloch, who is under investigation by
the FBI.
   The president refused to reveal details of the case, noting that
the investigation is still under way. But he said: ``Any time a
person is ... allegedly involved in something like betraying his
country, that to me is a very serious matter.''
   Asked about possible damage to U.S. security, Bush, a former CIA
director, replied: ``I don't think anyone could give you a full
damage assessment'' at this time. He added that the case, if true,
``doesn't help'' further better relations between the superpowers,
even though everyone knows that ``espionage goes on.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Secretary of State
James A. Baker III informed Bush of the Bloch investigation
``within minutes after he learned of this.'' He declined to say
when that was.
   Asked why Bush commented on a case still under investigation,
Fitzwater replied, ``We normally don't have a situation like this.''
   The president's remarks came as Bloch's one-time superior,
former U.S. Ambassador to Austria Ronald Lauder said he ``did not
like'' Bloch. ``There was something about him that bothered me,''
Lauder said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   Lauder, now a Republican candidate for mayor of New York, said,
``The more I got to know him the more I realized there was
something dramatically wrong.'' He said he had Bloch, who was
second-in-command for most of his seven years at the Vienna
embassy, recalled in July 1987 because of ``insubordination.''
   But The New York Times today quoted the former director general
of the Foreign Service, George S. Vest, as saying, ``It was time
for (Bloch) to go, anyway, so we brought him back. He was not
pulled back prematurely.'' Vest said Bloch returned to attend a
seminar for top diplomats.
   A U.S. official said today that Lauder was upset that Bloch went
behind his back and lobbied against a Justice Department
recommendation to place Austrian President Kurt Waldheim on a list
of people banned from the United States because of Nazi activities.
   Bloch and Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, a Waldheim
supporter, ``were very tight'' over that affair, said the official,
who spoke only on condition he not be named. A year after the April
1986 recommendation was made, Waldheim was placed on the list.
   Stansfield Turner, who was CIA director during the Carter
administration before Bloch's embassy stint, said ``it's not very
likely (Bloch) would know the specific names and details''
concerning CIA agents in Vienna because such information is not
normally shared with officials outside the agency.
   However, a person in Bloch's high position ``could have gotten
into things that weren't normally his business'' because of his
access to the embassy's cable section, Turner said on ``Good
Morning America.''
   Bush administration, legislative and law enforcement officials
skirted questions Sunday about the inquiry into Bloch, the
highest-ranking U.S. official ever implicated in an espionage
investigation involving the Soviet Union.
   Bloch, who has not been charged with any crime, reportedly was
filmed by U.S. officials earlier this year passing a briefcase to a
known Soviet KGB agent in a European capital.
   The State Department and the FBI are ``pursuing the inquiry
thoroughly in order to identify the compromised security which has
occurred and the appropriate steps,'' the State Department said.
Bloch's building pass and security clearance have been lifted.
   ``My directions are really not to comment on this case,'' an FBI
spokesman said Sunday. ``You're talking about security matters.''
   Although reports remained sketchy, the picture was emerging of a
54-year-old career diplomat who was frustrated by his lack of
advancement while serving in Vienna under two political appointees.
   Vienna, because of geography, traditionally has been a hotbed
for East-West spy activity.
   Bloch's close friend, Foreign Minister Mock, was quoted Sunday
as saying he heard about the recent allegations of espionage
through Austrian channels three weeks before the news broke in
Washington on Friday.
   Mock said in the Austrian tabloid Kurier there was ``a certain
suspicion on the U.S. side reaching back into the 1970s'' about
Bloch's activities.
   Bloch also served in the newly opened U.S. Embassy in East
Berlin in 1974 as economic counselor, having been transferred from
West Berlin.
   Bloch's neighbors in an upper-class neighborhood in Washington
told reporters that Bloch, who had been under obvious surveillance
by the FBI until news accounts of the spy probe aired late Friday,
had not been seen since then.
   ABC News reported Sunday night he was under the FBI's watch at a
private home north of New York City with his wife and daughter.
   By all accounts, Bloch, born in Austria, had access to sensitive
intelligence material during his career, and officials expressed
concern he could cause serious damage to U.S. interests if he
shared his secrets with foreign powers.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions that Bloch
helped shape the State Department's policy on transfers of
sensitive technology to the Soviets and actively participated in
the decision earlier this year to relax U.S. policy on transfers.
   One senior State Department official who worked with Bloch told
the Journal the most sensitive intelligence information on Soviet
and European security matters bypassed Bloch's office. But Bloch,
as an office director, had access to general intelligence
information, including a morning intelligence summary so sensitive
officials are required to read it and return it to a waiting
courier without copying it, the official said.
   Those who knew Bloch well ruled out spying for money or
ideology. Mock said he was ``deeply shaken and really shattered''
by the allegations.
   Sources told ABC that Bloch claimed he spied because he fell
into a Soviet sex trap but that investigators have discounted the
story.
   Some sources pointed to Bloch's frustration over having been
passed over for an ambassadorship after serving under political
appointees in Austria and running the embassy in Vienna for a time.
   One of the ambassadors Bloch served was Helene von Damm, an
Austrian-born political appointee by former President Reagan who
caused a scandal in Viennese society by marrying Peter Guertler, a
hotel owner.
   She resigned in June 1985, citing speculation that her marriage
constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic duties.
Bloch ran the embassy after Von Damm resigned until Lauder arrived
almost a year later.

   Forty years after they lost a civil war
and thousands were sent to prison or into exile, Greek communists
have joined conservatives in a government bent on prosecuting
official corruption.
   An estimated 80,000 people were killed in the civil war that
ended in 1949 and 25,000 communists were sentenced to death, life
imprisonment or exile in remote mountain villages or barren Aegean
islands.
   The party was legalized 15 years ago and Greece's communists now
are the only ones in a Western government coalition.
   ``The Communist Party endured years of hardship because the
people at its core were tough and held little regard for their own
lives,'' said historian Tassos Vournas. ``They spent years in
exile, in prison, many were executed, but now we have passed from
the age of fighting to an age of dialogue.''
   Greeks began fighting each other when the Germans retreated in
1944 and the communists tried to assert their military strength.
   With British help, the conservative government checked the
communist army, but a truce collapsed in 1946 and fighting resumed.
Government forces crushed the communists three years later with
Britain's support and aid from the United States, which provided
more than $2 billion under the Truman Doctrine.
   In addition to those executed, imprisoned or sent to internal
exile, tens of thousands of Greek communists fled to the Soviet
Union and other countries in the Eastern bloc.
   After the Communist Party was banned in 1947, it stayed alive as
the United Democratic Left, which was formed in 1951 and won 10
seats in Parliament.
   It had become the main opposition by 1958, with 24 percent of
the vote and 79 seats, but its influence declined, and ended during
the military dictatorship of 1967-74.
   The government of Premier Constantine Caramanlis, a
conservative, legalized the party after the dictatorship ended in
1974.
   Andreas Papandreou led his Socialist Party to power in 1981 on
promises to pull Greece out of NATO and close down U.S. military
bases, two cornerstones of Communist Party foreign policy.
   Election results indicated the communists had only slight and
waning popularity. The party got 9.9 percent of the votes in the
1985 general election, down from 11 percent in 1981.
   ``This was one of the most critical periods in the party's
history,'' said political analyst Stelios Kouloglou. ``Communist
parties throughout Europe were losing influence.''
   Harilaos Florakis, former leader of the party, proposed at its
congress in May 1987 ``a coalition of leftists and progressive
forces.''
   His invitation was aimed at a Eurocommunist faction that left
the Communist Party after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia
in 1968. The dissidents turned him on grounds the party toed the
Moscow line.
   Early this year, Papandreou's government was falling into
disarray because of allegations that members of the leadership were
involved in scandals, and the two communist groups realized only
unity would give them a significant role.
   In February, the Coalition of the Left and Progress was born
with Florakis as its president, and its platform appeared to be
dominated by Eurocommunist thinking.
   Florakis, 75, resigned as secretary-general of the Communist
Party this month but remained as head of the Coalition.
   Although the Coalition did not do as well in the June 18 general
election as polls had suggested, 13.12 percent of the vote gave it
28 of the 300 seats in the unicameral parliament and a role as
power broker.
   Both the conservative New Democracy party, with 145 seats, and
the Socialists with 125 courted the communists. The Coalition
refused to work with the Socialists unless they dumped Papandreou
and other officials accused of involvement in banking, financial
and arms scandals.
   Florakis' coalition agreed to join New Democracy in a government
devoted to cleaning up the scandals. It was sworn in July 2 with a
pledge to call elections in three months.
   In 1944, seven leftists were given minor positions in a
``national unity'' government in an attempt to keep the communists
from seeking power by military means. This time, the communists
have the major Justice and Interior ministries.
   Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis, a member of New Democracy, told
Parliament: ``Those who bring up the past belong to the past.''

<HEAD>Administration Expects Close Ties with Japan to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration expects close ties
with Japan to continue regardless of who is chosen to succeed the
fallen government of Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, the White House
said today.
   Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said he had no
direct comment on the election results in Japan ``simply because
it's an internal matter.''
   ``However, the United States has long and strong relationships
with Japan. We certainly would expect those to continue under any
successor government,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``We don't have any idea who that successor will be. But whoever
it is we look forward to working with them, to establishing
friendly and productive ties of a kind that we have had in the
past,'' he said.
   Uno and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in
the upper house of the Diet for the first time in 34 years. Uno
announced today he would resign, saying he accepted ``the
responsibility for this defeat wholly upon myself.''
   Fitzwater said the United States and Japan are bound by their
trading ties and militarily. ``We would expect to maintain all of
those ties in a solid fashion,'' he said.
   But he said the U.S. government would continue to ``press rather
vigorously'' with the new government on trade problems. ``That can
be done in a positive fashion, and that's the way we expect to do
it,'' he said.

   Police reported no injuries in the bombings, the latest in a
series of attacks on U.S. government facilities.
   An anonymous caller told radio station WKAQ that the two bombs
had been placed by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Forces, a
little-known pro-independence group. Police could not confirm the
authencity of the claim.
   The anonymous male caller said the bombing was to protest the
presence of military bases in Puerto Rico and the present
commonwealth status.
   Police said the explosive devices went off at 2 a.m. at the
shopping center about 10 miles east of San Juan, causing
``considerable'' damage to the recruiting office, the post office
and a supermarket.
   The FBI and local police were investigating.
   Two explosive devices went off last week at post offices in the
towns of Coamo and Guayama.
   In June, the Borinquen Popular Army, also known as the Los
Macheteros, or machete wielders, claimed responsibility for a bomb
that caused heavy damage to a U.S. Army recruiting station and a
branch of the Bank of Boston in Bayamon, about 15 miles northwest
of San Juan. Borinquen was Puerto Rico's name before the Spanish
conquest of the island.
   Similar explosions, with no injuries and minor damage, occurred
in June at a U.S. Customs office in the southern city of Ponce and
at a Chase Manhattan Bank branch in Caguas, about 20 miles south of
San Juan. No group claimed responsibility for those blasts.
   Los Macheteros is a militant pro-independence group that has
been relatively inactive in recent years. During the 1970s, the
organization blew up five National Guard fighter jets valued at $47
million and ambushed a U.S. Navy vehicle, killing two sailors and
injuring 10 others.
   Sixteen alleged members were charged in the $7 million robbery
of a Wells Fargo depot in Hartford, Conn., in 1983. The FBI alleged
that the Macheteros intended to use the stolen money to finance
their campaign to gain independence for Puerto Rico.
   Ojeda Rios, 55, still faces trial in Hartford and is currently
being tried in San Juan's U.S. District Court on separate charges
stemming from the wounding of an FBI agent during his 1985 arrest
in Puerto Rico.
   The explosions came one day before Puerto Rico Constitution Day,
which is an island holiday. The Constitution, approved 37 years
ago, established the island's commonwealth relationship with the
United States.
   In a referendum scheduled for 1991, voters on the island
territory will have the choice of statehood, independence or
continued commonwealth status.
   Puerto Rico, with 3.3 million mostly Spanish-speaking people,
became a U.S. territory in 1898 and has been a commonwealth since
1952.

<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Torrential downpours in western India on
Monday triggered flash floods and landslides that collapsed houses,
and one report said at least 100 people had died.
   The deaths were reported by the United News of India news agency
in coastal Maharashtra state after the rain flooded rivers and high
winds knocked down houses and trees.
   At least 13 people died in Bombay, the state capital, according
to police.
   An official at Bombay's meterological office said 11 inches of
rain was recorded in 24 hours. It is the highest figure recorded in
one day since July 2, 1984, when 22 inches of rain fell.
   The rain was accompanied by winds gusting up to 52 mph, the
official said.
   Bus and train services in the city were suspended and roads were
inundated with waist-deep water. Trucks were stranded in swirling
waters and several villages were cut off, police said.
   Transactions at the stock exchange, India's largest, were
suspended, said M.R. Mayya, an exchange official.
   The army was called out in the districts of Beed, Deglur and
Biloli to rescue the residents of 46 villages that had been
surrounded by floodwaters.
   At least 2,400 fishermen were reported missing after they were
caught on the seas during the storm, the news agency said.

   Heavy rain in northern China touched off floods
and landslides that killed at least 117 people, destroyed thousands
of buildings, and ravaged crops, official reports said Monday.
   Some of the deaths were caused by Typhoon Hope, which struck
China on Thursday. Up to 14 inches of rain has fallen in some
places, the English-language China Daily said.
   At least 1,400 flood-related deaths already have been reported
in China this summer.
   The China Daily said 41 people were killed and 381 people
injured in landslides caused by torrential rains last week in
Dandong, in the northeastern province of Liaoning.
   The rail line between Dandong, a coastal city on the North
Korean border, and the provincial capital of Shenyang was washed
out in 65 places, the report said. More than 16,000 buildings were
destroyed.
   In neighboring Jilin province, 43 people have died since
Saturday in floods and mudslides, the China Youth News said. It
also reported 22 people missing.
   Typhoon Hope killed 21 people in Zhejiang province and 36 in
Fujian province, the China Daily said.
   In Fujian's Zhanghe county, 4,000 homes were destroyed,
authorities said. At least 8,151 acres of crops, 12,500 tons of
grain, and 1,000 pigs were washed away since Saturday, they said.
   The storm also cut telecommunications and transport in that area.
   Heavy rains and mudslides in northern China have killed four
people in Beijing, according to previous reports. China Daily said
12 people still were missing in Fengjiayuan, near Beijing, after a
mudslide Saturday.
   Flooding has been severe in southern and central China since the
beginning of June.
   Yang Zhenhuai, deputy director of the State Flood Control
Headquarters, said about 2,700 people die annually in floods.

   A federal appeals court today temporarily
delayed the Iran-Contra trial of the CIA's former station chief in
Costa Rica.
   The appeals court in Richmond issued an emergency stay at the
request of the Justice Department, putting off the trial of Joseph
Fernandez in order to address national security issues that are
threatening to kill the case.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton told a pool of
prospective jurors to go home, saying he would call them back after
the appeals court has an opportunity to rule on the national
security questions.
   Earlier today, Hilton rejected motions by the prosecutors in the
case which would have allowed the CIA to protect details of some of
its programs and the names of three of its stations and facilities
in Latin America from disclosure in the courtroom during the
Fernandez trial.
   Fernandez was to go on trial today on four criminal charges of
obstructing and making false statements to the CIA inspector
general's office and the Tower Commission.
   Fernandez allegedly tried to cover up his assistance to Oliver
North's secret supply effort to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond will consider
the Justice Department's request to intervene in the Fernandez case
and Hilton's refusal to bar disclosure of the specifics about the
CIA stations and programs.
   In court, Hilton rejected proposals by the government that would
have limited disclosures about CIA stations and programs at the
trial of Fernandez.
   Fernandez says he needs to present the information about the
agency's stations and programs in his defense.
   One proposal presented by Laurence Shtasel, who is prosecuting
Fernandez, would have referred to CIA stations and facilities in
Latin American countries by a series of numbers rather than by
name. Hilton rejected that proposal.
   The judge also rejected a proposal Shtasel made Friday in which
the government offered to drop a portion of the case in exchange
for not allowing disclosure of three highly sensitive CIA programs
in Costa Rica. Hilton said it was important to Fernandez's defense
that he be allowed to refer in open court to the programs.
   The Justice Department's seeking of an appeals court delay was a
last-ditch attempt to avoid filing an unprecedented national
security affidavit that would kill the case.
   Fernandez is charged with lying and giving misleading statements
to the CIA inspector general's office and to Congress in an alleged
coverup of assistance to Oliver North's secret Contra resupply
network.
   U.S. intelligence experts spent the weekend with Justice
Department officials drafting an affidavit detailing national
secrets that they will not alow to emerge in the trial.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's office said Friday the
Fernandez case would be untriable if the Justice Department's
affidavit barred disclosure of too a wide range of material.
   ``If the CIA's request for a broader ... affidavit is granted,
the case will be untriable,'' prosecutors said in court papers.
   With a Justice Department affidavit in hand, Hilton would have
no choice under federal law but to prohibit the ex-CIA operative
from using in his defense the classified information detailed in
the affidavit.
   That could lead to the judge dismissing some or all the criminal
charges, depending on the scope of the affidavit.
   Fernandez was charged with two counts each of making false
statements and obstruction of an inquiry by the congressional Tower
Commission and the CIA's office of inspector general.

<HEAD>Movie About Deng Opens, But Audience Seems Unimpressed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The major summer film, a period piece about
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, opened Monday in Beijing and added to
the clamor of praise for the man blamed by many Chinese for the
recent military crackdown.
   ``The Baise Uprising'' has as its hero a 25-year-old Deng
leading the peasants of remote Baise in southern China to victory
over Nationalist troops in 1929. The Nationalists ultimately lost a
bloody civil war to the communists and retreated to the island
province of Taiwan in 1949.
   The movie's opening comes less than two months after the
government called in troops to put down a student-led pro-democracy
movement, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people. Many
Chinese say they have lost confidence in the government as a
result, and many hold Deng responsible for the killings.
   ``The Baise Uprising'' fits neatly into the ideological
education all Chinese are required to undergo.
   Most of those who attended the opening day showings at two
Beijing theaters were organized by their work units, and the movie
could be required viewing for many Chinese. It opens nationwide on
Aug. 1, the anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation
Army.
   Unless Chinese are told to see the movie, many doubtless would
not pay the steep admission fee of about 67 cents _ five times the
price of most films.
   In the one-hour, 45-minute film, Deng is portrayed as a
confident, level-headed and charismatic leader with all the
answers. But the film also shows a human side that one rarely sees
in revolutionary-style movies.
   There are scenes of Deng, an avid bridge player, playing cards
and telling a young girl that the strategies involved in playing
bridge and chess are much like fighting a war.
   He also is depicted as a music lover who carries a record player
with him on his campaign to Baise. When townspeople ask him to sing
a song from his native Sichuan province, he brings out the record
player and puts on music from ``Carmen.''
   The media has given enormous publicity to the movie, which was
made to mark the 60th anniversary of the Baise uprising and the
40th anniversary of communist rule.
   The People's Daily, the party newspaper, on Saturday devoted
half a page to the film, with articles writen by Lu Qi, who played
Deng, and Chen Jialin, the director.
   State-run TV last week broadcast a story on the movie's
premiere, showing Vice President Wang Zhen shaking hands with
actors. Wang and other top leaders supervised the movie's
production, according to the People's Daily.
   Despite the build-up, the audience at one afternoon showing at
Beijing's Capital Theater seemed unimpressed. There was very little
audience reaction, with only laughter during the two times Deng
tells his followers to ``seek truth from facts,'' a slogan he has
made famous in the past decade.
   Comments after the movie also lacked enthusiasm. A few people
said, ``It was OK.'' Others just shrugged their shoulders and
walked away. One young woman said it was worth watching, but didn't
say why.
   The audience reaction was in stark contrast to another movie
that opened a month ago in Beijing.
   During the opening of ``The Towering Kunlun,'' about Mao
Tse-tung's battles with the Nationalists in central China,
audiences applauded scenes of students demonstrating. They also
clapped when U.S. Ambassador Leighton Stuart promised money for
weapons to the Nationalists, but only if Nationalist leader Chiang
Kai-shek did not to use the weapons against the students. Stuart's
comment since has been cut from the movie and the demonstration
scene has been shortened.
   Theater employees reportedly informed on those who cheered. That
could explain the muted audience reaction to scenes in ``Baise
Uprising,'' including an incident in which Nationalist troops shot
at student demonstrators.

   Opera singer Martti Talvela, whose deep
bass voice and tall stature were famous in the title role in
``Boris Godunov,'' has died of a heart attack, newspapers reported
today. He was 54.
   The reports said Talvela, who often performed at the
Metropolitan Opera in New York, died Saturday night while
celebrating a daughter's wedding at his farm in Juva, about 150
miles northeast of the capital.
   Newspapers reported, without quoting sources, that Talvela died
of a heart attack shortly after dancing with his newly married
youngest daughter.
   Officials at the Savonlinna Opera Festival today declined to
comment on his cause of death and said his family also was refusing
comment on funeral arrangements.
   The festival on Sunday was interrupted by an announcement of his
death. The festival's artistic director, Walton Gronroos, said the
father figure of Finnish opera had died.
   Talvela was artistic director of the festival in eastern Finland
from 1972 to 1979, which he elevated to a major international opera
event.
   Two months ago he agreed to become the director of the Finnish
National Opera in 1992.
   Roger Lindberg, a member of the committee to select a new
director, described Talvela's unexpected death as a ``catastrophe''
for the National Opera and said ``it will be very difficult to find
a suitable new director.''
   Talvela, born Feb. 4, 1935, began his international career in
1960 and was acclaimed in major opera centers for his powerful bass
voice. He also recorded extensively.
   The singer is survived by his wife, Anukka, and three children.

   Domino's Pizza Inc., accused of
endangering motorists as its drivers hustle to make deliveries
within 30 minutes, will begin telling its side of the story on its
pizza boxes.
   The nationwide publicity campaign will focus on Domino's claim
that it puts a premium on speed in its kitchens, not on the streets.
   In a letter to be attached to 21 million Domino's boxes, company
President Dave Black writes in part, ``Yes, a 30-minute delivery is
important, but safe delivery is more important.''
   The campaign follows a lawsuit filed in Pittsburgh by a couple
who claim they were injured in a collision with a Domino's delivery
car and that the store manager was more concerned about haste in
delivery than the accident.
   The store manager rushed to the scene and said: ``Let's get this
pizza on the road,'' according to the lawsuit filed earlier this
year by Frank and Mary Jean Kranack.
   The company has denied the allegation that the manager was more
worried about the pizza than the wreck.
   The Ann Arbor-based chain said its 75,000 to 80,000 drivers were
involved in 20 fatal accidents in 1988 and three so far this year.

<TEXT>
   South Korea said Monday it will arrest
a radical student who plans to return from North Korea via the
border at Panmunjom as a symbol of national unification.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon called an emergency meeting of
key Cabinet ministers and the government later said it asked the
U.S.-led United Nations Command to warn communist North Korea it
will deny entry to radical student Im Su-kyong if she tries to
cross the sensitive border area.
   A spokesman for the command, which polices the armistice in the
southern half of the demilitarized zone, said it will not interfere
in inter-Korean politics.
   The border is guarded by heavily armed troops and passage from
one side to the other without mutual agreement is considered a
violation of the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.
   South Korea, already angry at unauthorized visits to North Korea
by a dissident clergyman, a lawmaker and Ms. Im, said she will be
arrested and charged with violating the national security law.
   Ms. Im, 20, has said she will cross the border Thursday, the
anniversary of the cease-fire, to dramatize radical and dissident
demands for unification of the divided peninsula. She flew to North
Korea via third countries this month to attend an international
youth festival.
   A Seoul newspaper said if Ms. Im crosses the border, Korean
soldiers attached to the U.N. command have been ordered to arrest
her.
   There are no physical boundaries in the truce village of
Panmunjom. A person allowed access into the joint security area
from either side would find it relatively easy to walk across.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo said Monday that Ms. Im's
plan is an example of extreme leftist thinking and he warned
college students not to take their freedom for granted.
   Also on Monday, six students armed with firebombs, pipes, tear
gas shells and leaflets demanding the withdrawal of American troops
tried to break into the U.S. Information Center in Seoul.
   The students fled as police arrived. Two were arrested.
   Radical students said they will rally in Seoul to welcome home
Ms. Im and protest plans to arrest her. The radical National
Council of Student Representatives said it also will demonstrate to
denounce the armistice agreement and the presence of 43,000 U.S.
troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Also Monday, the national intelligence agency issued its third
summons to Kim Dae-jung, head of the leading opposition Party for
Peace and Democracy, asking he make himself available for
questioning about a party lawmaker charged with espionage and
making an unauthorized visit to North Korea.
   Kim said he knows nothing about the case of legislator Suh
Kyung-won and accuses the government of trying to make him appear
pro-communist. The intelligence agency said it will get a court to
order Kim's cooperation.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp.'s second-quarter profit plunged by
more than $1 billion, largely due to an $850 million provision for
costs associated with the nation's worst oil spill, the company
reported today.
   Net income fell 87 percent to $160 million, or 13 cents a share,
from $1.2 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the comparable 1988
quarter, Exxon said.
   Revenue for the oil giant rose 9 percent to $23.6 billion from
$21.63 billion.
   Exxon said the special second-quarter provision for expenses and
legal claims stemming from the March 24 spill in Alaska's Prince
William Sound reduced earnings by $850 million, or 67 cents a share.
   Exxon said the provision includes amounts already paid out as
well as estimated future outlays.
   The nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the
tanker Exxon Valdez fouled hundreds of miles of water and coastline.
   ``Clean-up of the Alaskan oil spill was Exxon's top priority in
the quarter,'' said Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl. ``The
magnitude of the required effort is huge and therefore costly.''
   But Rawl said Exxon's financial position remains strong.
   For the first half of 1989, Exxon's provision for the Alaska oil
spill totaled $880 million, including $30 million charged in the
first quarter. Including the provision, Exxon's earnings totaled
$1.4 billion, or $1.12 a share, for the first six months, down 46
percent from $2.66 billion, or $1.96 a share, in the first half of
1988.
   Without the provision, Exxon's first half earnings were $2.3
billion, or $1.81 a share, down 13 percent.
   Revenue for the first half of 1989 rose to $45.86 billion from
$43.63 billion a year earlier.

   Ringo Starr reached out to a new generation of
rockers by letting kids in free to his first-ever solo concert, but
the crowd was dominated by those who were teen-agers in the former
Beatle's heyday.
   Starr, 49, opened the first show of his 30-city tour Sunday
night by singing ``It Don't Come Easy.'' After his third vocal, on
``Yellow Submarine,'' he retired to the rhythm section of a band
that was a graying constellation of rock stars.
   They included former Beatles collaborator Billy Preston, who
played the organ on ``Let it Be,'' Bayou singer Dr. John, guitarist
Joe Walsh, saxman Clarence Clemons and guitarist-keyboardist Nils

   Children under 12 were let in free if accompanied by an adult.

   Paula Gwynn, a 6-foot-2 television producer
and professional model from Washington, D.C., is the new Miss Black
America.
   Miss Gwynn, 22, was selected from among 46 contestants
representing 37 states in the 21st annual pageant that ended early
Monday.
   Elaine Joyner, 28, Columbia, N.C., was second; Racquel Eatmon,
19, Mansfield, Ohio, was third; and Tiffany Williams, 20,
Abbeville, La., was fourth.
   The pageant, held in conjunction with the annual Indiana Black
Expo, involved judging in swimsuit, public speaking and talent
competitions..
   Kathy Tunheim, a company spokeswoman, would not say whether a
sale of the business is one of the options being considered.
   However, Tunheim said negotiations to sell the company's stake
in Yamatake-Honeywell, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
will begin within a few days. She would not identify potential
buyers. Japanese investors currently own half of the company, she
said.
   Honeywell's restructuring program will include the elimination
of 4,000 jobs worldwide over the next 18 months, including 300
corporate staff positions targeted in a previous announcement.
   Honeywell currently employs about 78,000 workers. Many of the
job cuts will be made through attrition, but layoffs will be
necessary, Tunheim said. The company had announced last month that
it would lay off 300 employees.
   Today's restructuring announcement follows speculation that
Honeywell is a takeover target. Honeywell's stock price has risen
sharply in the last two weeks following published reports that
General Electric Co. was considering acquiring the company.
   The takeover rumors began after the company announced that it
lost $435 million in fiscal 1988.
   Honeywell's second-quarter profit jumped to $74.8 million, or
$1.73 a share, from $31.6 million, or 75 cents a share, in 1988.
   John McManus, a securities analyst with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York, said today's announcement could deter
a takeover attempt, although it won't guarantee independence for
Honeywell.
   ``They are trying to basically boost the stock price to make it
more difficult for someone to take them over,'' McManus said. ``It
will also alleviate some of the large shareholders who have been
pounding on the door. They are doing the things they have to do to
deter a takeover.''

   The White House said Monday it expects to
maintain close ties with Japan regardless of who succeeds the
fallen Sousuke Uno as prime minister.
   Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said Sunday's
elections, in which Uno's Liberal Democrats lost control of the
upper house of parliament, were ``an internal matter.''
   ``The United States has long and strong relationships with
Japan,'' Fitzwater said. ``We certainly would expect those to
continue under any successor government.''
   Uno announced Monday he would resign as prime minister. His
resignation will open the way to dissolving Uno's Cabinet and
restructuring the governing party's leadership.
   ``We don't have any idea who that successor will be,'' Bush's
spokesman said. ``But, whoever it is, we look forward to working
with them, to establishing friendly and productive ties of a kind
that we have had in the past.''
   Fitzwater said the United States and Japan are bound
economically and militarily, and ``we would expect to maintain all
of those ties in a solid fashion.''
   But he said the U.S. government would continue to ``press rather
vigorously'' on trade problems with the new government.
   Fitzwater also said that a non-binding congressional resolution
calling for restrictions on the FSX jet fighter deal with Japan
``faces a very heavy veto threat'' from the president.
   Several senior advisers have urged Bush to reject the measure as
an intrusion on executive branch deliberations and because it
``compromises the president's ability'' to manage foreign affairs,
Fitzwater said.
   Bush has until July 31 to act on the FSX resolution, but will
probably make his decision before then, Fitzwater said.
   Regardless of what course Bush takes, the joint development deal
will go through because the congressional resolution is
non-binding, Fitzwater said. Congress never passed a binding
resolution disapproving the joint venture.
   Under the FSX deal, General Dynamics Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. will jointly develop the new fighter for Japan
based on an improved F-16 design. Japan had been set to develop a
jet fighter by itself until then-Defense Secrtary Caspar Weinberger
talked the Japanese into the joint development, which ensures U.S.
companies 40 percent of the revenues from the project.
   Critics in the Senate and elsewhere have charged the deal will
give the Japanese access to U.S. technology they could use to
develop a domestic airplane industry.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
attend a conference on Cambodia's future next weekend in Paris,
working for a settlement that rules out a return to power of the
Khmer Rouge, the State Department announced today.
   A U.S. official said Baker probably will meet there with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. That session could begin
preliminary planning for a summit meeting between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The month-long conference, involving the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France _ is designed to map out Cambodia's
future after the last Vietnamese troops leave the country at the
end of September.
   ``We hope our collective efforts can become another example of
how we, the Soviets and others can work together to resolve
regional conflicts,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said in making the announcement.
   Baker and the other foreign ministers plan to attend the opening
session. The conference will then proceed through the month of
August in the form of working-level groups.
   The departure of Vietnamese troops, which backed up a pro-Hanoi
and pro-Moscow government in Phnom Penh, was long a U.S. foreign
policy goal.
   ``With an international, verified Vietnamese withdrawal, we hope
to see a beginning of an end to the tragedy that has beset the
Cambodian people for years, and a beginning of a transition to
genuine Cambodian self-determination,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Her statement said a settlement had to ensure peace in Cambodia
by containing three key elements:
   _A verified withdrawal of Vietnamese forces.
   _Prevention of a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, who have
been implicated in the killings of as many as 1 million Cambodians
during the 1970s.
   _Self-determination for the Cambodian people.
   ``Given the legacy of warfare in Cambodia and the tragedies of
the past it will be difficult to achieve peace,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said. ``But it is necessary to try. It is time to at least try to
end the suffering of the Cambodian people. We hope the day is near
when the Cambodian people will be able to live in peace and achieve
true self-determination.''

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc., subject of intense takeover
speculation for the past several weeks, said today it will cut
4,000 jobs, reduce its weapons business, repurchase shares and
increase dividends.
   The sweeping restructuring will result in a 65-cent increase in
the company's annual dividend, to $2.75 a share, and possibly
include a special cash dividend, said James Renier, chairman of the
controls maker and defense contractor.
   The news prompted a sharp increase in Honeywell stock on the New
York Stock Exchange. In early morning trading, the stock was up
$3.75 a share to $89.25.
   The program will include the sale of a ``substantial portion''
of Honeywell's 50 percent stake in Yamatake-Honeywell, a Japanese
controls maker, Renier said. Analysts have valued the holding at
about $1 billion.
   Honeywell also will reduce its weapons business, which accounts
for about 20 percent of its revenues. Honeywell spokeswoman Kathy
Tunheim would not say if a sale of the business is one of the
options being considered.
   The program will include elimination of 4,000 jobs worldwide
over the next 18 months, including 300 corporate staff positions
targeted in a previous announcement. Tunheim said the company is
not ready to announce specific locations for the job cuts.
   Honeywell employs about 78,000 workers worldwide. Many of the
job losses will come through attrition, but layoffs will be
necessary, Tunheim said.
   Honeywell's board of directors also has broadened a company
stock repurchase plan from about 3.5 million shares to 10 million
shares. The stock will be bought on the open market, Renier said.
   The program should improve operating profits by about $150
million over the next 18 months, Renier said.
   Negotiations to sell the company's stake in Yamatake-Honeywell,
which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will begin within a
few days, Tunheim said. She would not identify potential buyers.
Japanese investors currently own half of the company, she said.
   Renier said the reduction of Honeywell's weapons business is
part of a strategy begun in 1988 to ``concentrate on core controls
businesses that principally serve commercial markets as well as the
market for military and space controls.''
   Honeywell is the leading manufacturer of torpedoes for the Navy
and also supplies small, medium and large ammunition to the Army,
Tunheim said.
   John McManus of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York
said the action could deter a takeover attempt, but not guarantee
independence for Honeywell.
   ``They are trying to basically boost the stock price to make it
more difficult for someone to take them over,'' McManus said. ``It
will also alleviate some of the large shareholders who have been
pounding on the door.''
   Honeywell's stock price has risen sharply in the last two weeks
following published reports that General Electric Co. was
considering acquiring the company.

<HEAD>Sex Offenders Waive Chance at Parole to Seek Treatment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNION SPRINGS, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Alabama inmates have temporarily
waived their chances at parole so they can participate in an
18-month prison treatment program for sex offenders.
   Convicted rapist Robert Mosley said in an interview last week
that agreeing to give up a May 1990 parole review, his first, was
not difficult.
   ``I need the treatment more than I need my freedom,'' said
Mosley, 28, serving a 10-year sentence imposed in 1986.
   Because of his commitment to the program he and the four others
are next due for parole consideration in January 1991.
   Samuel Gardner, in prison for 16 years since being convicted of
rape, said waiving his chance to escape a 99-year term was the only
way he had to help himself. He was to have had a February 1990
parole hearing.
   ``I came to the conclusion that if they let me out on the day I
was thinking about, I would be back here in a month,'' said
Gardner, 38, previously denied release in 1986 and 1988. ``I don't
want no more victims.''
   Mosley, Gardner and the other three who waived parole hearing
dates are among 26 inmates participating in the state's sexual
offender treatment program at the Bullock County Correctional
Facility, said director Pamela Van Wyk. The five are the first to
give up a chance at release to seek treatment.
   The five were required to sign away their chance at parole
during the 18-month period to ensure they would be able to finish
therapy, said Merle Frieson, director of mental health treatment
for the state prison system.
   The program includes group sessions and exercises to enable
inmates to overcome sexual arousal that leads to acts like rape and
child molestation, Frieson said.
   ``The treatment is rugged enough ... that you have to have to be
highly motivated to complete it,'' he said.
   Ms. Van Wyk said only inmates who admit to their crimes and to
having a sex-related problem are admitted to the program.
   For inmate Raymond McLoyd, confessing that he was the only one
responsible for his 1978 rape conviction was the hardest part.
   ``I did what I wanted to do. My thinking was just so twisted,
distorted,'' a weeping McLoyd said last week. He has been denied
parole three times and put off his next hearing for nine months to
enter the program.
   Ms. Van Wyk said the treatment is intended to teach inmates how
to control their perverse desires when confronted with situations
they find sexually exciting.
   While the men might always be excited by certain images or
sounds, Ms. Van Wyk said, they can learn to quell their dangerous
impulses.
   ``We're not curing anything. We're teaching people to control
their arousal,'' she said.
   Ms. Van Wyk said officials do not know if the program is a
success. Of 26 inmates who have completed the 18-month program,
none has gone before the parole board and only one has completed
his sentence.
   ``And the real test is when they get back on the street,'' she
said.
   A similar program in Canada has had a 50 percent to 60 percent
success rate in steering sex offenders away from more assaults, Ms.
Van Wyk said, and Alabama officials would be pleased with similar
results.
   Warren Gaston, executive director of the State Board of Pardons
and Paroles, said he was unsure how the board would look upon sex
offenders who have completed the program.
   But while the board is reluctant to release rapists and child
molesters, he said, the inmates' willingness to stay in prison for
treatment is ``rather remarkable.''

   High wind created treacherous currents in
which three tourists drowned off unguarded southern Florida
beaches, and Miami Beach lifeguards made at least 15 successful
rescues, officials said.
   Beach Patrol Chief Ray Sforza said the rip-tide remained
dangerous Monday. ``It's insidious,'' he said.
   While the patrol didn't close the beaches Sunday, swimmers were
warned to avoid the currents after the first two drownings. But
many stayed in the ocean _ some within sight of the blanket-covered
corpses on the beach.
   The National Weather Service said strong easterly wind caused
rip currents, which develop when strong waves bring a lot of water
close to the shore. The water then opens up gaps in sandbars and
rushes back out to the ocean through channels.
   ``With each days you have same conditions, it exacerbates the
rip currents,'' Sforza said. ``You get more and more sandbar breaks
up and down the coast, so you have more rip currents.''

   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said Monday he will
resign because of his party's weekend election disaster, and once
again the Liberal Democrats seek a leader to rescue them from a
morass of scandal and unpopular policies.
   In Sunday's election for half the seats in Parliament's upper
house, the governing party lost its majority for the first time
since its formation in 1955.
   Opposition leaders demanded the Liberal Democrat Party
relinquish power and elections for the more powerful lower house be
held early. The Liberal Democrats would be forced out if they lost
those elections.
   Uno announced Monday he would resign after only two months in
office to take responsibility for Sunday's balloting, in which
voters chastised the party for money and sex scandals, a new sales
tax that outraged housewives and more liberal food import policies
that angered farmers.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States ``has long and strong relationships with Japan. We
certainly would expect those to continue under any successor
government.''
   Socialist candidates were the main beneficiaries of voter
discontent with the party that has spent 34 years in power.
Socialist Party secretary Tsuruo Yamaguchi said Monday: ``To avoid
inviting further confusion, the LDP must hand over the government
to the opposition parties.''
   Takako Doi, head of the party, said she would call a meeting of
opposition leaders to form a coalition to oppose the Liberal
Democrats in the upper house. The Liberal Democrats retain a
comfortable majority in the lower house, which chooses the prime
minister and has most of the power, and elections need not be held
until July 1990. The governing party has 293 of the 512 seats.
   Leaders of the Liberal Democrats said the new party president,
who customarily becomes prime minister, should not be chosen
through the usual backroom politicking that led to Uno's nomination.
   Takeo Fukuda, a former prime minister who opposed choosing Uno,
said the next leader should be elected by the party's parliament
members.
   Shin Kanemaru, a former deputy prime minister and powerful party
elder, also was said to favor an election. Uno was chosen by
Kanemaru's protege, former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who had
been chosen by Uno's mentor, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone.
   Takeshita resigned to take responsibility for the scandal in
which the Recruit Co. publishing conglomerate allegedly tried to
buy influence with large political donations and cut-rate stocks.
   It took a month to decide on Uno, who was foreign minister and
untouched by the Recruit scandal, as Takeshita's replacement and
few are willing to speculate about who might be the successor this
time.
   Uno, a colorless politician with no power base, was seen as a
safe choice after favored candidate Masayoshi Ito refused the job.
   Reports arose soon after he took office that he had kept paid
mistresses, and opposition grew among women already angry about the
3 percent sales tax.
   Last month, Uno was said to have declared, ``I didn't become
prime minister because I wanted to,'' and asked party leaders to
let him step down.
   He did not mention the sex scandal in his televised news
conference Monday, but said he was resigning after the election
defeat because the ``ultimate responsibility is mine.''
   ``It was a very difficult election,'' he said. Asked how he felt
after announcing his resignation, Uno said his mind was ``meikyo
shisui,'' a poetic phrase meaning tranquil as a mirror or still
water.
   Of the 126 seats at stake in Sunday's election, the Socialists
won 46 and the Liberal Democrats 36, according to final results
announced Monday evening. Socialist strength in the 252-seat
chamber rose from 43 to 66 and the Liberal Democrats declined from
142 seats to 109.
   The Socialists ran only 54 candidates.
   Komeito (Clean Government), a centrist party, won 10 seats, the
Japan Communist Party 5, the centrist Democratic Socialists 3 and
independents and minor parties 26.
   Rengo no Kai (Confederation Group), a new party, also hurt the
Liberal Democrats badly. It ran 12 candidates 11 of them won, most
in districts where the governing party usually does well.
   Most of the new party's backing comes from the Rengo labor union.
   Any opposition coalition is expected to be fragile. Most parties
oppose the sales tax, but they differ on such issues as defense
policy and relations with the United States.
   In the past, the Socialists have favored disbanding military
forces and scrapping the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty under which
about 64,000 American soldiers are stationed in Japan.
   Socialist leaders now say they would seek only to revise the
treaty, but Ms. Doi and others have said U.S. warships should be
inspected and denied entry to Japanese ports if they carry nuclear
arms.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fans of ``Beauty and the Beast'' howled when
CBS left it off its fall schedule, but now the network has
announced the weekly saga will return with a surprising two-hour
movie.
   ``It is going to be a real corker, and I don't want it to get
out,'' CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said of the movie
plot Saturday during a speech at a TV critics convention.
   LeMasters said the series, about the love between a beautiful
woman and a man-beast who lives in a subterranean world beneath New
York City, would veer away from the love story and that star Linda
Hamilton would have a ``reduced presence.''
   Miss Hamilton is expecting a baby, but LeMasters would not say
if she would return full-time after her baby is born. Ron Perlman
plays the leonine, Shakespeare-quoting beast, Vincent.
   LeMasters said CBS kept the show in production, because ``it's
one of the better-done shows we have on the network.'' He said it
was initially dropped because executives thought the series had
begun to ``implode on itself.''
   ``Those stories between Vincent and Catherine just got more and
more narrow and we were unable to explore issues that we want to
explore. We think that we have corrected the problem, and what
we're going to do, we're going to re-launch it as a two-hour movie
that will have some rather stunning details attendant to it.''

<TEXT>
   GOLUB-DOBRZYN, Poland (AP) _ These may be beleaguered days for
Poland, but it does have its knights.
   The 15th century came alive this weekend, at an international
tournament recalling the valor and vigor of a period of vast power.
   For a day, about 25,000 people put aside their economic woes
that beset modern Poland to be transformed back to an era of
pageantry, with knights atop their steeds testing their jousting
skills according to regulations culled from historic records.
   ``It was the greatest age in Poland's history,'' says Zygumnt
Kwiatkowski, director of the castle that was the site of an annual
competition that saw knights from four countries in a pitched
battle.
   ``Poland was independent then and was a peaceful superpower in
Europe,'' he said. ``Poland never sought war with anyon and on the
other hand it could counter any war threat.''
   The tournament has been staged since 1977 on the grounds of the
hulking brick castle that rises from a bluff, overlooking the
apartment blocks of the central Poland town of Golub-Dobrzyn.
   At their aid are damsels recruited from a local high school;
competitors with crossbows, hatchets and pronged mallets; and
thousands of common spectators whose murmers of respect and rumor _
``Someone almost had his nose sliced off'' _ spread the spirit of
the event.
   ``When I see the knights, I think about reviving old traditions
of knighthood,'' said Kwiatkowski.
   ``It is not only the clothes but also reviving the spirit, the
old traditions: honesty, keeping promises, honor. These are
features that today have lost their value but without which it is
hard to live,'' he said.
   Though bogged down by the demands of a modern knight-manager,
the castle director says he could still ``get on a horse and defend
the honor of the Polish knight.''
   Those responsibilities fall mainly to the likes of Remigiusz
Postolski, a 30-year-old Warsaw art restorer who with his teammates
bested the knights from Italy, France and the Soviet Union.
   Knight Paulo Parici of Arezzo, Italy, was awarded the golden
sword for individual performance at the close of hostilities Sunday.
   ``Almost every boy in Poland when he is small reads books and
watches films about knights and their fights. For me it passed into
a more serious interest,'' Postolski said.
   Most of the weapons, armor and costumes are made by hand, and
modern knights must make some accommodations. Suits of armor ended
with Reebok sneakers and one crossbow champion wore skintight
leggings of hot pink and black Spandex below his coat of mail.
   There's also the problem of how to sit on a slatted bench with a
dagger at one's side.
   The castle, too, has met the modern age. The knights' pledge of
princely competition is made by microphone, and a TV antenna rises
from the ramparts. Flags and tablets mark great dates in castle
history: 1296, 1527, 1965.
   The castle is owned by a government tourist agency. Much
reconstructed from the ravages wrought by time and neglect, it is
still in need of defense fortifications against tourists without
tickets.
   But the hobbyists are loyal to the legends starting in 1385 when
Poland, united with Lithuania under the Jagiellonian kings, ruled a
vast swath of central Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea and
stretching east toward Moscow.
   It was a time of cultural and scientific advancement, when
Nicolas Copernicus discovered the Earth's rotation around the sun
and the Jagiellonian University was established in Krakow.
   But from a Polish knight's point of view, the era's highlight
was likely the victory over the infamous Teutonic Knights, a
Germanic order first established in 1191 for the Crusades.
   The most famous confrontation, the Battle of Grunwald on July
15, 1410, took place about 50 miles from the castle and the victory
of the Polish and Lithuanian forces over the Teutonic camp _ after
a knightly pre-battle exchange of swords _ has lived on into the
modern history of three nations.
   Kwiatkowski is an animated and unabashed fan of the 15th century.
   What about poverty? ``It's exaggerated. We have much bigger
extremes in wealth today.''
   What about pestilence? ``What about AIDS?'' he retorts.
   ``We Poles have a kind of attraction to tradition and history,''
added Postolski, whose sword bore the nicks of a few ``friendly''
rounds. ``At that time our country was a European superpower.''

   Federal investigators said Monday they have
uncovered no evidence that high-ranking government officials used a
homosexual prostitution ring or that other patrons have been
blackmailed by the escort service.
   ``It was a credit card case in the beginning, and it still is,''
said one law enforcement source who spoke only on condition of
anonymity. ``There has been no indication yet of blackmail,
espionage, or big names in this.''
   The Secret Service, which conducted raids on a posh northwest
Washington home in February and May as part of a probe into the
string of escort services, is involved in the case because of its
traditional jurisdiction over credit card fraud, said spokesman
Robert Snow.
   The Secret Service also is conducting a separate, internal
investigation of two uniformed officers accused of allowing
lobbyist Craig Spence to take several prostitutes on late-night
White House tours. One officer has admitted accepting an expensive
watch from Spence and giving him a piece of Truman china.
   Paul Balach, a personnel officer in Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole's office, resigned after the Washington Times reported that
credit card receipts bearing his name had been found by
investigators.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens has said that his phase of the
probe involves only allegations of credit card fraud.
   In their raids, authorities recovered a sophisticated telephone
network, paging devices, directories listing customer's names, and
separate lists of telephone numbers for some clients, court records
show.

<HEAD>Posey's Contra Mission Back on Track After Court Victory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLINT CITY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-described freedom fighter says
his mission to aid the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government is back on track since a federal judge dismissed treaty
violation charges against him.
   The criminal indictment charging Tom Posey and five others with
violating the Neutrality Act by supporting the Contras was
dismissed July 13 by a federal judge in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   The Neutrality Act allows prosecution of anyone making war from
U.S. soil against a nation with which the United States is at peace.
   But U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger agreed with the defense
that the Reagan administration waged war against the Sandinistas in
1984-85 despite congressional votes to cut off funds.
   Posey, 44, a co-founder of Civilian Materiel Assistance, said in
an interview in Sunday's editions of The Birmingham News that his
legal battles have ruined his produce business and cost him
$100,000 in legal fees.
   But he said he's not bitter and hasn't abandoned the goal he and
a few conservatives set for themselves when they created CMA in
1984 _ fighting communism when, where and how they can, with
Central America first on the list.
   Although professing no bitterness, Posey does express some
disillusionment with Washington after all of his problems.
   ``I look at the White House people as more worried about their
retirement and reputation than truth and justice,'' he said.
   ``He (President Reagan) is the one who said the buck stops here,
but when it got hot, he let it pass on through,'' Posey said.
   Posey is preparing for the annual CMA convention in Madison Aug.
3-6, where Contra leader Adolfo Calero and at least two top Contra
field commanders will speak. He is sending more than 1,000
invitations.
   His budget comes primarily from the sale of CMA caps, shirts,
belt buckles and a recently completed videotape of the Contras in
action.
   The tape features a Soviet-made Hind-24 ``flying tank''
helicopter being shot down by Contras armed with U.S. Redeye
missiles.
   Posey said it's ``the only known footage'' of the
top-of-the-line Soviet chopper going down. CMA literature promises
that it will ``get your blood boiling.''
   Posey said CMA's activities will remain in the field of of
supplying non-lethal support to the Contra soldiers, away from the
field of battle.

   A mother's desperate push saved the life of a
2-month-old boy in a stroller, but the mother was killed when she
couldn't dodge a car steered by an allegedly drunken driver.
   The car, going in reverse at high speed, struck and killed
Claire Ordonez, 29, on Sunday, said police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   ``She was trying to put her hands out to stop the car,'' said
Charlie Moore, one of those who tried to help the victim. ``She
didn't have time to get herself out of the way, but she did save
the baby.''
   Witnesses and police said Ms. Ordonez who was walking with
family members in the Bronx at the time of the accident. She saved
her baby, Julio Cesar Ordonez, by pushing the boy's carriage with
such force that it went nearly across the street, they said.
   Onlookers managed to lift the 1977 Ford station wagon off Ms.
Ordonez, and a doctor who was nearby tried unsuccessfully to save
Ms. Ordenez.
   The driver, Ventura Lopez, 50, a cleaner for the New York
Transit Authority, was charged with vehicular homicide and driving
while intoxicated, O'Donnell said.

<HEAD>State Broadens Inspection of Boeing's B-2 Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Health and safety officials have broadened their
inspection of the plant where The Boeing Co. builds sections of the
B-2 stealth bomber to include virtually all aspects of Boeing's
work on the top-secret plane.
   State and federal inspectors have been trying to determine if
chemicals and fiberglass-like composite materials used to make the
radar-evading bomber pose a health threat to Boeing employees.
   Washington Department of Labor and Industries spokeswoman
Barbara Dunn said last week that two state inspectors have made
about five visits to Boeing's Developmental Center and expect to
make more.
   Two inspectors from U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration also are examining parts of the south Seattle plant.
   While the original inspection focused on the composite
materials, the state's effort has been expanded to all aspects of
B-2 construction, including examining machinery and looking for any
safety hazards, Ms. Dunn said.
   Air samples have been taken inside the plant to check for
chemical levels, and employees are being interviewed about possible
problems, she said.
   No complaints have been received from workers at the
high-security plant, Ms. Dunn said, adding, ``We just want to make
sure that we're covering all the bases.''
   Earlier this year, Lockheed Corp. was fined nearly $1.5 million
by OSHA following inspections at its Aeronautical Systems Co. plant
in Burbank, Calif. That plant produces a plane technologically
similar to the B-2, the F-117A stealth fighter.
   Boeing's work on the stealth bomber is as a subcontractor for
the main builder, Northrop Corp. of Los Angeles.
   By law, Ms. Dunn said, state officials cannot release results of
the inspection until it is complete and Boeing has been informed of
the findings. She said the work probably will be completed by late
July or early August.
   The plant inspection is being done at the request of Rep. Norm
Dicks, D-Wash., who was concerned about the safety of chemicals
used in aerospace construction.
   The inspection began June 6, about two weeks later than
originally planned. The delay occurred when the Defense Department
denied the state inspectors access to some of the areas because
they did not have security clearances and OSHA inspectors had to be
brought in, Ms. Dunn said.
   ``The Boeing Co. would have allowed us in. It was essentially
the Department of Defense that denied us entry,'' she said.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer has quoted unidentified plant
workers as saying the delay was used to clean and fix up shop areas
in anticipation of the inspection.
   ``The walls were wiped down, new tops were put on the tables _
it was nothing like our normal working condititions,'' the
newspaper quoted one employee as saying.
   ``We did not issue directives to go and do anything unusual,''
said John Kvasnosky, spokesman for Boeing Advanced Systems, which
operates the Developmental Center. The company has safety and
housekeeping operations that take place continually, he said.
   Richard Terrill, assistant regional administrator for OSHA,
declined to say what his inspectors were examining, citing security
reasons. But he said OSHA's role was ``very limited,'' involving
only a small portion of the plant.
   Terrill said OSHA's work should be finished in about a month.
   In the past year, dozens of Boeing Commercial Airplanes
employees at an Auburn plant who worked with phenol formaldehyde
complained of a variety of ailments, ranging from dizziness and
rashes to memory loss. The chemical was used to make luggage bins
and other jet interior parts.
   Air sampling at the plant found formaldehyde levels well within
federal standards, but Boeing discontinued use of the chemical and
improved ventilation at the plant.
   Phenol formaldehyde has not been used at Boeing Advanced
Systems, Kvasnosky said.

<HEAD>Desert Tortoise Placed On Endangered Species List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The desert tortoise in Utah and other
Western states was placed on critical ``endangered'' species status
Monday because it is threatened by a fatal respiratory disease, a
congressional aide said.
   The action taken by Steve Robinson, acting director of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, was expected to anger cattle ranchers
worried about the declaration's possible impact on their grazing
rights on federal land where the tortoise is found.
   The designation applied to the Mojave population of the tortoise
west and north of the Colorado River, including those in southern
Utah, southern California, Nevada and northwestern Arizona, said
Rick Guldan, spokesman for Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah.
   The Sonoran desert tortoise population, located south and east
of the Colorado River in Arizona and New Mexico, was not affected,
Guldan said.
   The emergency designation means all the protections of the
Endangered Species Act immediately go into effect for 240 days.
   Fish and Wildlife studies found desert tortoise populations in
the western Mojave have declined 58 percent since 1985 because of
the respiratory disease.
   Before the designation was announced, Fish and Wildlife
officials said the agency had been petitioned by environmental
activists concerned about the outbreak of the disease, which had
been seen before only in tortoises in captivity.
   Jim Middaugh, spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
the disease may have been spread by someone releasing a captive
tortoise into the wild. His group filed a lawsuit in federal court
for the District of Columbia last week seeking to force the
Department of Interior to protect the tortoise.

<TEXT>
   The investigation of senior diplomat
Felix S. Bloch on suspicion he spied for the Soviets has again
turned the spotlight on Vienna as a hotbed of East-West espionage
and intrigue.
   Orson Welles' depiction of Harry Lime in the 1949 film ``The
Third Man'' stamped on the minds of millions an image of devious
dealings in the Austrian capital, which, like Berlin, was divided
into British, French, American and Soviet sectors after World War
II.
   Former Nazis and refugees from Eastern Europe struggled to
survive in the postwar turmoil, selling knowledge to any side that
would pay and helping to weave a net of intrigue.
   The Soviets withdrew their forces from Austria in 1955, but they
left behind a large embassy and many other offices that Western
intelligence agencies always have viewed as potential helpers of
the KGB and the GRU, Soviet military intelligence.
   Intelligence sources in Washington say nearly every American
taken to court on charges of spying for the Soviets in the past
five years had come to Vienna to meet KGB officers.
   The Soviets are as aware as the Americans that these trips often
are part of the evidence used by the FBI. Some intelligence sources
believe, therefore, that one purpose of the trip to Vienna is to
get a blackmail hold over the American, threatening exposure of a
hard-to-explain journey if he wants to wriggle out of his deal with
the KGB.
   Americans who have made Vienna trips include Ronald Pelton, the
National Security Agency officer who tipped Moscow to a system that
hid U.S. submarines from Soviet radar, and John Walker, head of the
family spy ring in the U.S. Navy.
   Court documents in the Walker case included written instructions
from the KGB about how to ``drop'' information, including a
detailed description of doing a walking ``pass'' on a Vienna street.
   It was also in Vienna that Marine Clayton Lonetree confessed to
a security breach in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   A Soviet defector who worked for the GRU in Vienna in the 1970s
described Moscow's elaborate intelligence network in the Austrian
capital in a 1985 memoir, ``Aquarium,'' published in Britain.
Viktor Suvorov (not his real name) said detailed procedures were
worked out to avoid immediate identification by Austrian and other
security services in Vienna of agents in the embassy.
   He estimated about 80 percent of all Soviets in Vienna _ where
Moscow has an Aeroflot office, trade representations, and a large
diplomatic presence at the United Nations _ engaged in ``other
work'' outside their official duties.
   Part of the elaborate coverup of Soviet intelligence work,
according to Suvorov, was to assign active agents, such as himself,
mostly to work outside Austria.
   But most of the work, he said, focused on acquiring Western
technology and contingency plans for military or economic crises.
   It is not known what information, if any, Bloch handed to the
Soviets during his seven years in Vienna, where he arrived in 1980
as head of the U.S. Embassy's economics section. He became deputy
chief of mission, a post he held for years before returning to
Washington in 1987.
   However, his position would have put Bloch, a native Austrian
who left the country at age 3 with his Jewish parents, at the
center of sensitive U.S.-Austrian negotiations over the illegal
transfer of Western technology through Vienna to the East bloc.
   Several Viennese shipping agents and firms have come under
scrutiny in the past decade amid U.S. allegations they helped the
Soviets and their allies to acquire technology that was banned for
export to the East.
   Austrian intelligence sources say they do keep a careful watch
for illegal activities. Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, a
close friend of Bloch, bristled Monday when reporters suggested
Vienna was a hotbed of spying.
   ``These regrettable events are not more numerous than
elsewhere,'' Mock said, allowing however that Vienna is perhaps
exposed because of its ``geographical position'' just an hour's
ride from the Czechoslovak and Hungarian borders.
   There are tens of thousands of Soviet and East European
scientists, emigres, diplomats and other officials in Vienna,
making blanket surveillance tough.
   In 1981, Soviet researcher Arkady Belozerov denied reports he
had spied but caused a stir when he resigned from a post at the
prestigious Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, a 17-nation
project south of Vienna that has attracted hundreds of Soviet
researchers since it was set up in 1972.
   A neighboring institute in the same town of Laxenburg was in the
news the same year when Josef Hodic, a Czechoslovak historian who
had been granted asylum in Austria as a signatory of the Charter 77
human rights appeal, suddenly disappeared.
   Hodic turned up in Prague, where state-run media said he had
been working all along as a Czechoslovak agent.
   One of the most mysterious cases centered on Vienna was that of
Nikolai Shadrin, said to have been a Russian defector turned double
agent for FBI and KGB.
   Shadrin disappeared when he went to Vienna to meet two KGB
agents in December 1975. The disappearance did not become public
until July 1977, when Shadrin's Polish-born wife said he had been
kidnapped and appealed for help to get him back.
   The U.S. government pledged its assistance but has never
disclosed Shadrin's fate.

<BYLINE>Hundreds March in Tbilisi; Strike Disrupts Factories ^By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of protesters marched in the
capital of Soviet Georgia on Monday after 10 days of ethnic
violence in the republic's western region, and organizers of a
strike said it had affected 33 factories.
   A day of marches in Tbilisi culminated in an evening rally
attended by 2,000 people shouting ``Freedom from the U.S.S.R.!''
and slogans protesting the alleged failure of authorities to
protect Georgians from armed attacks in the Black Sea region of
Abkhazia.
   In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the national
legislature ethnic unrest in Abkhazia had spread to Tbilisi,
causing ``the disorganization of transportation'' on Monday,
adding: ``The situation became acute.''
   Most stores and other businesses appeared to be open, but Irakli
Tseretel, a leader of the Georgian Party of National Independence
and a rally organizer, claimed 33 factories were closed, including
two military plants.
   Tseretel's report could not be confirmed and three other
informal groups that favor Georgian independence were boycotting
the strike, fearing a repeat of April 9, when 20 demonstrators died
at the hands of soldiers.
   Another speaker at the rally, Zviad Gamsachurdia, demanded the
arrests of those responsible for attacks on ethnic Georgians in
Abkhazia, a separate administrative area within the republic.
   An editor at the Georgian news agency Gruzinform said buses did
not appear Monday morning in some regions of Tbilisi, but that
service was normal by midday.
   The interrupted bus service appeared linked to a transit strike,
including a railway walkout that began over the weekend and ended
Monday. Tass, the official news agency, said the rail strike
stranded thousands of people.
   Several hundred people demonstrated throughout the day in
central Tbilisi, protesting the violence in Abkhazia.
   ``When those Abkhazians started to knife Georgians, it just
drove us out of our minds,'' said the news agency editor, Nana
Gelashvili.
   Tass said no armed clashes had been reported in Georgia or
Abkhazia for two days, but it reported more confiscations of
weapons from extremists by internal security troops and police.
   Authorities seized 104 rifles and more than 500 pounds of
explosives in the previous 24 hours and found a cache of 130 pounds
of explosives and 6,500 feet of detonating cable near the Abkhazian
village of Gvandra, Tass said.
   Residents of Abkhazia voluntarily turned in 744 firearms, the
agency reported.
   Nineteen people have been reported killed and more than 400
injured since July 15 in clashes between warring Georgians and
Abkhazians in the seaside resort area 880 miles south of Moscow.
   Two regional Communist Party secretaries and two government
leaders in Abkhazia were dismissed Saturday.
   Each ethnic group blames the other for the trouble. Abkhazians,
a minority in their own region, want more economic independence and
cultural rights. Georgians insist the enclave remain part of their
Caucasus republic.
   During the past month, at least 132 people have been killed in
ethnic unrest in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.

   A city that has trouble paying for
trash collection has been billed for hundreds of unauthorized
long-distance telephone calls, including many to dial-a-porn
services.
   The cash-starved city's monthly bills average $5,000 and include
calls to virtually every state, the Belleville (Ill.) News-Democrat
reported Sunday.
   Many phones in the police and maintenance departments logged
calls to ``900'' prefix adult talk lines, the paper said.
   Treasurer Charlotte Moore said the number of questionable calls
in each month's two-inch-thick bill shows the need for an internal
auditor.
   ``After I suggested it to the (aldermanic) council two years
ago, they cut my staff in half,'' she said. A continuing cash
crunch has made it hard for the city to pay salaries and collect
garbage in recent months.
   In a review of bills from March, April and May, the paper found
hundreds of dollars worth of calls from Texas, Florida and other
places were charged to the city either by reversing the charges or
by using a city credit card number.
   Many outgoing calls from City Hall were equally questionable.
There were calls to a trivia line that gives callers a chance to
win prizes, to the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas, and to a pay phone in
a St. Louis hospital.
   And there were at least 16 calls from a St. Louis number to the
beeper of a man convicted on Friday on charges of running a cocaine
ring.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private memorial service will be held for
Donald Barthelme, an award-winning modern fiction writer who died
of cancer at the age of 58.
   Barthelme was known best for his wry humor and innovative
techniques in short stories, many of which were published in The
New Yorker, Atlantic and the Paris Review.
   Barthelme underwent successful surgery for throat cancer 17
months ago. But he became ill with a form of blood cancer while
living in Rome this summer and was admitted to M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston three weeks ago. He died Sunday.
   Barthelme also was an English professor at the University of
Houston.
   ``He was a reigning presence in the program,'' said Edward
Hirsch, poet and professor of English at the University of Houston.
``Donald was the kindest man I've known. He had a deep-bred
Southern courtesy and a kind attitude towards life, personally and
professionally.
   ``I've looked to him often as a mentor, teacher and friend.''
   A former newspaperman, Barthelme wrote 15 books, including
several novels and collections of short stories. His awards include
a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967, National Institutes of Arts and
Letters Award in 1972, National Book Award in 1972 and the Rea
Award for the Short Story in 1988.
   ``His short stories were witty, funny and in an odd way deeply
emotional,'' Hirsch said. ``He was one of the few writers who make
one proud to be an American and part of this culture. His work is a
lasting American glory.''
   Born in Philadelphia, he grew up in Houston and attended the
University of Houston, but never obtained his degree. He served in
Korea and Japan during his U.S. Army service in 1953-54. He began
work at The Houston Post in February 1955 as an entertainment
reporter and critic.
   He later directed the Contemporary Arts Museum then moved to New
York in 1962. He returned to Houston in the early 1980s to teach.
   Among his works are the prize winning children's book, ``The
Slightly Irregular Fire Engine or the Hithering Thithering Djinn,''
and the novels ``Snow White,'' ``Unspeakable Practices,'' ``The
Dead Father,'' and a collection of stories, ``Come Back Dr.
Caligari.''
   Barthelme's novel ``The King'' is scheduled for publication next
spring by Harper and Row.
   He is survived by his wife, Marion Knox Barthelme; two
daughters; his parents, and a sister and three brothers. Plans for
a private service were not complete Monday.

<TEXT>
   Townspeople are collecting money to help
their part-time police chief, who was hurt in the line of duty but
checked out of the hospital because the town doesn't have insurance.
   Chief Alfred H. Rodda, whose jaw was fractured in three places
when he was slugged by a man he arrested for refusing to pay a $24
restaurant tab, said Monday he's having trouble making ends meet.
   ``Things are kind of tough right now, because I support the
family during the summer driving a truck and I can't work,'' Rodda
said in a telephone interview.
   Rodda, 52, was hospitalized for two weeks with a broken jaw,
brain swelling and other head injuries. But he checked out July 14
when he learned the town of 600 in the Berkshire Hills doesn't have
insurance to cover officers hurt in the line of duty.
   Selectmen declined to discuss the chief's claim at a meeting
Thursday. Board Chairman Eleanor Patterson instead read a statement
which said, in part: ``Certainly the town is grateful for the 30
years of service Mr. Rodda has devoted to the town.''
   Officials declined to comment on the case on advice of town
attorney Sarah Bell. Ms. Bell did not return telephone calls to her
office Friday and Monday.
   Residents are pitching in to help the chief.
   A can for donations has been set out at Town Hall. And the
Jiminy Peak ski resort is organizing a raffle to raise money for
his medical bills, said marketing director Larry Dubin.
   ``It's a small town and we all know that if it was someone else
in trouble, that he'd be in the front of the line helping out,''
Dubin said.
   Organizers don't know how much money has been raised.
   Rodda keeps the peace on an on-call basis, and for most of 30
years hasn't charged the town for his services. The town's two
other part-time officers have refused to work since the chief's
injury.
   ``The townspeople are all for me,'' Rodda said. ``They'll
eventually get after the selectmen and I'll sue if I have to.''
   Rodda's attorney, Francis X. Spina, said Monday that state law
provides little protection for volunteer firefighters or part-time
police.
   ``People who serve as police and firefighters in small towns are
at a tremendous disadvantage if they get hurt in the line of
duty,'' Spina said. ``I'm not sure if they or the towns really
understand how much of a disadvantage.''
   If selectmen reject his claim for medical expenses, which Rodda
said now exceeds $10,000 and time lost from work, the chief can
sue, Spina said. State compensation laws appear to put a $3,000
annual limit on payments for time lost from a regular job by
volunteer firefighters and special police.
   ``You can't support a family on $3,000 a year,'' Spina said.
``It's less than welfare.''
   Rodda still needs surgery to repair his jaw.
   When the chief was hit June 30, his head slammed against the
pavement when he fell.
   Five witnesses captured the alleged assailant, William Finn, 38,
of Pittsfield. Finn, who had been at the Berkshire County jail
awaiting trial, was transferred to Northampton State Hospital for
psychiatric tests last week after allegedly attacking a guard.

   LA CELLE-SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen told resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk on Monday that
there won't be any role for Khmer Rouge guerrillas in an interim
government.
   At a news conference following four hours of meetings, Hun Sen
said the discussion failed to produce any results but noted more
talks were scheduled Tuesday. Sihanouk said there was ``complete
disagreement.''
   The encounter was designed to pave way for an international
conference toward ending the 10-year-old war in Cambodia by setting
up a transition government.
   The monthlong conference begins Sunday, two months before
Vietnamese troops backing Hun Sen's pro-Moscow government are to
complete their withdrawal.
   The meeting between the two leaders at an 18th century chateau
in this Paris suburb is to be expanded Tuesday to include Hun Sen
and leaders of the three-faction resistance coalition: Sihanouk,
Son Sann of the non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation
Front and Khieu Samphan, the nominal chief of the Chinese-backed
communist Khmer Rouge since the reported resignation of former
leader Pol Pot.
   The Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot was responsible for the deaths of
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during a three-year reign that
ended with the Vietnamese invasion in December 1978.
   Sihanouk continues to insist on including the Khmer Rouge in an
interim government made up of the three resistance groups and Hun
Sen's government. He contends that giving the strongest of the
three guerrilla groups a place in the power structure is the price
of avoiding renewed civil war.
   Hun Sen disagrees.
   ``We think such a version simply signifies making the Cambodian
people hostage to the Khmer Rouge,'' he said. ``Our position is
that we are not hostages of Pol Pot and we will not let the
interests of the Cambodian people be bargained against the Pol
Pottists.''
   Hun Sen said he and Sihanouk took ``two steps backward'' at
Monday's meeting, but he refused to call it a failure, noting
discussions would continue Tuesday.
   Besides the future role of the Khmer Rouge, other issues on the
agenda include discussion of a cease-fire and a mechanism to
monitor the withdrawal of the remaining Vietnamese troops in
Cambodia, estimated at up to 70,000.
   The Cambodian prime minister blamed the impasse on Sihanouk's
insistance that as coalition president he was representing three
parties. In agreements reached at previous meetings, Sihanouk
represented only himself.
   Hun Sen said there should be only two Cambodian delegations to
the peace talks: his government and Sihanouk's Coalition Government
of Democratic Kampuchea.
   Sihanouk has the backing of many Western nations, including the
United States and the six-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, or ASEAN. There has been growing international support for
reaching a settlement that does not include the Khmer Rouge.
   In Washington, the State Department said Secretary of State
James A. Baker III will attend the opening session of the
international conference Sunday, and a spokeswoman reiterated U.S.
opposition to a Khmer Rouge role in an interim government.
   The conference is to include the Cambodian leaders plus all five
permament members of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States,
the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ as well as India,
Japan, Canada and Australia, and members of ASEAN: Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia, Philippins, Brunei and Singapore.
   As he left the chateau, Sihanouk said the resistance coalition
intended to keep fighting.
   The exiled prince, deposed in 1970, said that after the Sept. 30
Vietnamese withdrawal, 130,000 Vietnamese troops will remain in the
country ``hidden'' in the Cambodian army.
   Hun Sen's delegation distributed a copy of a cease-fire protocal
under discussion. However, as late as Friday, Sihanouk rejected a
cease-fire so long as armed Vietnamese remain in Cambodia.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner called
on Monday for a ``revolution in transportation,'' possibly
including high-speed rail systems, but a private analyst said the
car will remain king.
   Skinner launched a series of nationwide hearings aimed at
drawing up a national transportation policy for rail, highway, air
and water travel. Meetings are to be held in large and small cities
throughout the country through mid-September.
   The first one, in a Washington auditorium, featured the heads of
some of the country's biggest airline, railroad and automobile
companies and Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, who said the whole system is a
``handyman's special.''
   If the nation's system of roads, rails, waterways and airports
were listed in a real estate ad, she said, it would say: ``Lots of
potential, oldstyle craftsmanship with many modern conveniences,
but needs work, a real fixer-upper.''
   Skinner, who moderated the first session and will attend some of
the other meetings, said a decision to build high-speed rail
systems is one possible result of the effort. This could include
trains that travel up to 300 mph, particularly between cities where
air travel has reached maximum levels.
   ``It is time for a new revolution in transportation, and
hopefully it will be a peaceful revolution,'' said Skinner.
   In an interview prior to the meeting, Skinner said the nation's
airports, highways, bridges, waterways and mass transit systems are
simply wearing out.
   ``We're going to have to rebuild it and replace it, or we're not
going to be able to rely on it anymore,'' he said.
   Among the most critical problems, Skinner said, are a lack of
planning for new airports and neglect of $80 billion worth of work
needed on deteriorating bridges.
   William B. Johnston, senior research fellow at the Hudson
Institute, told the opening session that no new system is in the
wings that will revolutionize transportation within the next 25
years, so old systems have to be made more efficient.
   He said the fastest growth is in suburban areas as urban density
continues to decline and automobile use increases. The Hudson
Institute is a Washington think tank that has studied several
national issues, including transportation needs.
   ``The country has become ever more tied to its personal,
on-demand, point-to-point transportation system: automobiles,''
Johnston said.
   ``Despite oil shortages and price increases, the lamentations of
many environmentalists and urban planners, and multi-billion dollar
federal investments in urban transit, nothing has dented the
dominance of the automobile,'' he said.
   General Motors President Robert C. Stempel said GM and other
companies are studying ``smart cars and smart highways'' that would
be computerized for increased safety and efficiency.
   In the meantime, he said, some simple things can be done to
improve road travel in many areas: traffic light coordination,
improved toll road payment procedures, and clearer and brighter
highway signs and markings.
   The Transportation Department is inviting citizens with ideas
about how to move Americans in the 21st Century _ and about how to
pay for the changes _ to attend the hearings around the country or
to send written proposals to the Transportation Department.
   The transportation secretary said he doesn't want the sessions
to turn into a littany of complaints.
   ``You shouldn't go if you're just going to say, `We've got
gridlock, somebody ought to do something about it,' because we know
that,'' Skinner said. ``These are needs and idea sessions.''
   The first meeting outside Washington will be held in Moscow,
Idaho, on Tuesday, with the focus on rural transportation issues.
The last meetings will be in Boston on Sept. 11-12 and will deal
with drug and alcohol use in the commercial transportation system
and federal research and development.

<HEAD>Atlanta VA's Tommy Clack Named Disabled Vet Of Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tommy Clack, the Disabled American Veterans'
man of 1989, has spent 10 years trying to do for other veterans
what some caring people did for him.
   Clack, who will be recognized Sunday as the DAV's Outstanding
Disabled Veteran for 1989, has worked for the past decade at
Atlanta's Veterans Administration Medical Center, where he spent
much of his 21-month recovery following a battle injury in Vietnam
that claimed both legs and one arm.
   ``To come back here ... this isn't just a job,'' Clack said.
``It's an opportunity to serve veterans.
   ``It's a unique opportunity, to work at the level I work at and
see the continued goodness we do,'' said Clack, an assistant to the
director of the Atlanta VA since 1979. ``I think we deliver the
finest health care in the world today _ I did when I was a patient,
and I still do.''
   The 42-year-old Stone Mountain man, who holds Silver Star,
Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals, has spoken about veterans'
issues in all 50 states and isn't shy about discussing much of
anything, including his disability. But he'd rather talk of
opportunities ahead than dwell on an injury 20 years ago.
   ``God left me with my brain intact, my mouth in gear and my left
arm to be independent. What else do we need in life?'' he said.
``We're lucky to be alive, and let's go forward.''
   Clack was active in politics for several years, working in the
campaigns of U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn and Georgia Secretary of State Max
Cleland, among others, until his job with the federal VA forced him
to curtail his politicking. He misses it. ``I always busted my buns
for whoever I believed in,'' he said.
   Last year, he was co-chairman of the committee to erect
Georgia's Vietnam Veterans Memorial at the state Capitol.
   Clack, who was serving in the Army's 25th Infantry Division in
Vietnam when an exploding shell hit him, persevered through a long
recovery and more than 30 operations.
   ``When I was laid up in bed, and not expected to live, there
were many times when I'd wake up and somebody to my right, or my
left, or across from me had died,'' he said. ``Obviously, I've got
a lot to be thankful for.''
   Clack will be honored Sunday at the DAV National Convention in
Las Vegas.
   ``It's nice to be selected, but the country's full of
outstanding veterans who never get recognized,'' he said.
   ``To me ... getting awards is not where life really is. If we go
through life doing the best we can do, we're always going to be
ahead of the game _ that's how I play every day of life.''

   President Bush is the nation's commander in
chief these days, but on Monday it seemed as if he may be coveting
a position he used to hold: member of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   Bush, a former Republican congressman from Texas in the early
1970s, was paying not one _ but two _ visits to the powerful
tax-writing panel, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary.
   After a busy morning schedule, Bush rode up to Capitol Hill _
about a mile away up Pennsylvania Avenue _ for a committee
luncheon. Monday night, Bush and his wife, Barbara, were attending
a committee dinner.
   The committee is working on a bill whose chief aim is to raise
$5.3 billion in new revenues for deficit reduction next year.
   Needless to say, the Democrat-controlled panel, chaired by Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, is ``rather important,'' said Marlin
Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman.

   The revolt of Japanese voters against the Liberal
Democratic Party gave a strong boost to the Socialists, but
analysts say it was far more conservative than the result would
indicate.
   In Sunday's election, the conservative Liberal Democrats lost
their majority in the upper house of Parliament for the first time
since the party was formed 34 years ago.
   The Socialists gained 24 seats, thanks to support from women,
farmers and others disgruntled with the governing party's scandals
and economic policies.
   A record number of women candidates, 22, won their races.
Socialist Party chairman Takako Doi attracted adoring crowds of
women who wore pink scarves and applauded her criticism of the
Liberal Democrats.
   When Sousuke Uno announced his resignation Monday, women reveled
in their role in helping remove him. Their anger over allegations
that he had kept paid mistresses hampered Uno's efforts to restore
his party's reputation after an influence-buying scandal forced
predecessor Noboru Takeshita to quit less than two months ago.
   Bread-and-butter issues appeared to be even more important.
   ``I really believe that this was a people's revolution coming
from the kitchen,'' said Kazuo Shinsaka of the labor-backed Rengo
no Kai, a new party, who won election in Nara.
   The Socialists don't propose nationalizing industries or
equalizing incomes, but talk of restoring faith in politics,
repealing the new 3 percent sales tax, re-establishing protection
for farmers who complain about more open import policies and
improving the environment.
   Many women candidates campaigned not as feminists, but as
``ordinary housewives'' defending their homes against the sales tax.
   ``What this vote shows is that people want a return to the
status quo,'' said Seisaburo Sato, a political analyst. ``It was
the LDP that tried to change things.''
   Kuniko Inoguchi and other analysts said the economic prosperity
that has characterized more than three decades of Liberal
Democratic government may have encouraged the discontent.
   ``When the economy is good, people can afford to be critical,''
Inoguchi said. ``They can afford to worry about issues of justice.
   ``The LDP had modern policies but closed, premodern political
practices. They were telling everybody to adjust to change _
economic liberalization and internationalization _ but didn't make
an effort to change themselves.''
   Although the Liberal Democrats still may have a protectionist
reputation abroad, they have made major changes in the past few
years, usually under foreign pressure.
   Beginning four years ago, the government helped the yen rise and
import barriers fall enough to transform the structure of the
economy and hurt important groups, such as the farmers.
   Economic growth, still robust, now comes more from domestic
consumption and investment than exports.
   Japanese are richer than ever before and mamanufactured imports
have increased 78 percent since 1985. Protection of agriculture is
being chipped away.
   A tax reform package many experts consider economically sound
but clumsily introduced has given salaried workers more money to
spend and may help bring Japan's economy more in line with those of
its trading partners. The sales tax part has outraged housewives,
however.
   Women seek change in several areas. They have joined the labor
force in record numbers, helped by an equal opportunity law, but
often in poorly paid part-time jobs.
   Affluence has meant free time and more education, but women are
angered by lingering discrimination exemplified by Agriculture
Minister Hisao Horinouchi's recent remark that they are ``useless
in politics.''

   Extravagant was the name of the game Monday as
couturiers took a trip to dreamland in their winter shows.
   With the bicentennial of the French Revolution, designers seem
intent on bringing back clothes fit for a queen.
   The biggest news was at Dior, as the Italian couturier
Gianfranco Ferre nearly brought down the tent in an outdoor show at
the gardens of the Salomon-Rothschild Foundation. Ferre, named in
May to replace Marc Bohan, was chosen to add excitement to the
world's most prestigious label.
   Ferre obviously made the grade, with his opulent collection of
fitted clothes that led off with a waist-cinching fitted black
crepe redingote topped with a stovepipe hat. He finally wound up in
a Dioresque whirl of strapless ball gowns with tulle petticoats,
wrapped sable stoles and jackets, plus huge organza bows, and
bouquets of lily of the valley _ a favorite at Dior.
   Ferre managed to combine all the sumptuous fabrics and furs in
rigorously constructed clothes that looked both retrospective and
beautifully modern. He did a marvelous job of making red or pearl
gray persian lamb look like embroidered lace on a sexy strapless
sheath evening gown. He made fitted suits of creamy-beige ostrich
leather look soft and feminine.
   Ferre showed skirt lengths flatteringly around midknee for
daytime _ or opted for dressy trousers above the ankle.
   Arms were slim under shoulders with a whisper of padding for
shape. Whether caped ball gowns, satin trousers or tweed suits in
bold herringbones with sparkly sequins, the Dior line looked fit to
win.
   Hem lengths were irrelevant in most of the dazzling parades of
lucre.
   ``It's a trip abroad, a dream,'' said Jean-Louis Scherrer who
decked out his daughter and favorite model Laetitia like a
glamorous toy soldier, complete with gold tasseled epaulets and
braid-edged cap.
   Scherrer also was on the road to India, which he trod a few
years ago. This time, it was richer than ever, with lame-shot sari
silks and chiffons, galloon-edged boleros, rich shades of panne
velvet and Persian embroideries worn with silk and gold lame
turbans.
   ``You could wear this with jeans,'' said Scherrer, gesturing to
a richly braided military jacket with gold frog buttons.
   Chocolate is hot for next winter, and Scherrer went all out for
the browns, jazzing them up with shades of red from flame and coral
to cyclamen, plus some peacock and royal blue.
   Balmain's designer Erik Mortensen also used prodigious amounts
of expensive fabrics in a successful extravaganza. The man who
practically reinvented shorts for couture went in for a
pedal-pusher pants, making them extraordinarily beautiful with
their toppers of bright teal blue, pistachio or flame-flared
jackets with bold buttons and funnel collars.
   Mortensen pulled off a clever trick by covering bodies with full
tent-like shapes, then baring legs clad in tights with gold Persian
embroidery up the sides. Among the memorable coats were the
gray-black-white pyramids in mohair and Mongolian goat, and the
red-and-green lacy models tufted with marabout or ostrich _ fun but
not very warm.
   The gold, copper and lame stiffened silk dresses stiffened like
thin sheets of metal were draped perfectly, slit up the leg for
walking. But they also dragged fishtail-trains, better for standing
around than circulating at a cocktail party.
   But even with piling on fabrics, stiff ruffles and sparkling
details, Mortensen made it all look floaty and light.
   Pierre Cardin got an enthusiastic hand for his winter
collection, which sparkled with enough titillating geometric
details to evoke his old magic.
   He obviously was tired of short skirts, showing very few. He
preferred a midcalf narrow skirt, or else simply no skirt at all
just a long jacket over tights, or slightly flared pants.
   Shoulders were natural or eclipsed by important collars, always
a strong point with Cardin, who knows how to play with shapes like
a kid with cutouts.
   The coats often had kimono or handkerchief sleeves, and some had
tiered skirts under a narrow bust.
   The favorite waistline was dropped to the hip, emphasized by a
narrow leather belt, the coat gathered like a ruffle beneath it.
   The fun popped up in high-collared short coats edged at the
armhole in fake fur or Mongolian lamb, in leather-banded sleeveless
sweater-coats, or in caped poncho looks.
   Evening wear by Andre Oliver was just as rich. Using stiffened
hoops and pleats _ the basic Cardin shapes _ Oliver sculpted some
dashing ladies of the night in Chantilly lace, fuschia and
pistachio taffeta, diaphanous chiffon.
   And they were topped by funny hats _ the favorite ones a pillbox
big as a hatbox, wrapped in satin ribbon, and a mortarboard tied
with a scarf.

   President Bush lobbied senators Monday to
support his $295 billion defense budget, saying the United States
needs ``maximum flexibility'' in arms control negotiations.
   The president called a bipartisan group of senators to the White
House for a pep talk as lawmakers prepared for congressional floor
action on military spending measures.
   Although Bush said defense programs are ``complicated,
expensive,'' he urged full funding for the Pentagon's fiscal
program. Already, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has made some
``important cuts'' in defense, Bush said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, praised Cheney for making tough choices in killing six
or seven programs.
   The committee has ``been willing to bite a part of that bullet,
too,'' he said, adding: ``We hope the Senate will stick with us
because we have basically backed the Cheney budget.''
   Among the potential targets of congressional budget-cutters are
the B-2 bomber, known as the stealth, the Strategic Defense
Initiative, or Star Wars, and how much money to give the
rail-mobile MX missiles or the single-warhead Midgetman.
   The expensive B-2 _ each plane is expected to cost more than
$500 million _ has been criticized by some lawmakers. But Bush
called the radar-evading plane a ``revolutionary technology'' that
is vital to the nation's defense.
   He said he could justify the B-2 expense because ``when you look
at the full defense program, I want to have maximum flexibility as
we have arms control negotiations.''
   The administration's defense outline calls for 132 bombers at a
cost of $70.2 billion. For fiscal 1990, Bush wants to spend $4.7
billion, but the House Armed Services Committee has already cut
$800 million from the program. Last week, Bush made his pitch to
members of the House panel.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said he is hopeful the
administration will get money for three bombers in the current
round. The plane made its first flight last week in Palmdale, Calif.
   ``We put fences around the B-2,'' Nunn said. ``We want to make
sure that the plane performs as advertised, both in terms of its
flying ability and also in terms of its stealth characteristics,
which are crucial.''
   Nunn also said the Senate panel supports complete research and
development of the V-22, known as the Osprey, but it wants to
withhold advanced procurement money until it is determined the
tilt-rotor aircraft can be used commercially.
   The senators want ``to see if someone other than the taxpayer is
going to put up some money,'' Nunn said.

<HEAD>Effect of Mexican Deal on Third World Still Unclear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general agreement between Mexico and its
creditor banks offers a glimmer of hope to the debt-strapped Third
World, but the success of the plan hinges on how far the banks are
ultimately willing to go, government officials and private bankers
said Monday.
   The Bush administration, which provided a final push over the
weekend to get the agreement, hailed the package as a landmark
success for its debt-reduction initiative, unveiled by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady on March 10.
   However, the banks that will implement the plan were more
reserved in their enthusiasm, with many contending that it was too
soon to say how much debt relief they will provide to Mexico
because they were still examining the fine print of the agreement.
   ``At the moment, we're exploring our options,'' Fraser Seitel, a
spokesman for Chase Manhattan Corp., said in a typical comment.
``We're looking at the entire (Third World) debt package.''
   The Bush administration hopes to use the Mexican agreement to
set a precedent that will facilitate debt relief in other
countries, with Venezuela and the Philippines considered the two
leading candidates to follow Mexico's lead.
   The administration has made debt reduction a key component of
its foreign policy, believing that the only way to insure the
survival of emerging democracies in Latin America is to find a way
to reverse the decade-long slide in living standards caused by the
crushing $1.3 trillion Third World debt burden.
   The Brady plan for debt relief seeks to slash this debt by
establishing incentives to get commerical banks to voluntarily
forgive a portion of the loans.
   However, banking analysts said it was unclear whether the
incentives being offered in the Mexican package were sufficient to
trigger a substantial writedown of the debt.
   In the case of Mexico, the debt-reduction package provides the
commercial banks with three options.
   On the debt-relief side, the banks can cut 35 percent off the
face value of the current loans or they can agree to reduce
interest rates to 6.25 percent, down from about 10 percent
currently.
   Banks also have the option of simply providing new loans.
   The administration estimated that the various options could save
Mexico about $1.5 billion annually off the $5 billion to $5.5
billion it must pay to service its $54 billion in commercial bank
debt.
   However, the administration stressed that this was a rough
estimate and would vary depending on individual decisions made by
the 500 commercial banks in the United States, Japan and Europe
that hold the Mexican debt.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and a leading congressional expert
on Third World debt, said that the Mexican agreement appeared
seriously flawed because it did not provide enough incentives for
banks to opt for the two debt-reduction options rather than simply
piling on new debt.
   ``A lot of the banks, without the necessary carrots or sticks,
are going to stick with the familiar (approach of supplying) new
money to pay old debt,'' Schumer said.
   Schumer said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the
last seven years. Since 1982, when the debt crisis first erupted,
Third World debt has more than doubled from $600 billion to $1.3
trillion.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., said the Mexican agreement did not
represent any ``long-lasting breakthrough in Mexico's debt
situation.'' He said that, while the amount of debt-reduction was
likely to be small, Mexico would benefit in the next couple of
years with an infusion of money to get its economy started again.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said that the
administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as it
could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to get
an agreement.
   ``It looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get
something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work,''
she said. ``It is a surface agreement that allows the
administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered
questions.''
   The administration had hoped that President Bush would be able
to present a completed Mexican package during the seven-nation
economic summit last week in Paris.
   When that deadline was missed, Brady stepped up his lobbying
efforts. He brought the bankers and Mexican negotiators to
Washington over the weekend for meetings at the Treasury, which
were also attended by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   After two days of discussions at the Treasury, final agreement
was reached late Sunday, in time for Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari to announce the breakthrough during a televised
broadcast, saying the proposal would answer the ``the cry of
Mexicans to return to growth.''

<TEXT>
   The government Monday lifted
3-week-old censorship restrictions on reporting ethnic violence but
told journalists to censor themselves.
   Also Monday, authorities halted a rally by about 600 Sinhalese
Buddhist monks who were demanding the expulsion of Indian
peacekeeping troops. No violence was reported.
   The monks' organization, which claims to represent 25,000
members, said it is prepared to join an armed struggle to oust the
Indian forces. Monk are an important political force in Sri Lanka.
   The government's announcement that censorship was being lifted
came 26 hours after the slaying of its chief censor, Themis Guruge.
He was shot to death Sunday while walking near his home.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed
the slaying of Guruge, who also headed state-run radio, on
Sinhalese extremists. Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne informed
local newspaper editors that censorship had been lifted, but he
also warned them: ``Be more responsible and maintain
self-censorship, especially on subversive activities and the Indian
issue.''
   The censorship had taken heavy criticism from both government
and opposition lawmakers.
   The July 6 announcement of censorship on domestic and foreign
press coincided with worsening ethnic violence and a deepening
dispute with India. Sri Lanka has demanded that India pull out
40,000 soldiers deployed as a peacekeeping force.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has denounced the Indian military
presence in his nation as a threat to Sri Lanka's sovereignty and
demanded a pullout by the end of July.
   Indian peacekeepers arrived in Sri Lanka two years ago at the
invitation of Premadasa's predecessor, President Junius R.
Jayewardene.
   India has long said it does not intend to keep its force here
indefinitely, but Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has said a premature
withdrawal would lead to even more bloodshed.
   More than 15,000 people have been killed in ethnic violence that
started with a separatist revolt by ethnic Tamil guerrillas in 1983.
   About 11,000 people have died in the Tamil insurrection,
including 1,000 Indian soldiers. According to the government,
Sinhalese extremists killed 4,000 people _ mostly Sinhalese
government officials and supporters _ in a backlash against what
they perceived as excessive concessions to the Tamils.
   The militant Sinhalese have been led by the People's Liberation
Front.
   During censorship, most references to the front or to Sinhalese
radicals were removed from news stories.
   Tamils, who make up about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, say they are discriminated against by Sinhalese. The
majority Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population,
dominating the government and military.
   During their rally, the saffron-robed monks were defying a ban
on such protests. They pushed past a line of police and sat on the
narrow lane outside the Sri Mahabodhi Temple in the capital,
Colombo.
   Earlier, their Sri Lanka National Bhikkhu Federation issued a
statement saying thousands of monks were prepared to join an armed
struggle to preserve Sri Lankan sovereignty from what it called
``the Indian army of invasion.''
   Before the rally, a 25-year old monk who declined to give his
name told a news conference in the temple compound that the monks'
federation had decided to join militant Sinhalese extremists and
student groups in opposing the government and the presence of
Indian peacekeepers.
   ``We do not believe the Indian army would go back on just a
request,'' the monk said. ``We believe that we have to take further
action, and we are prepared to do it.''
   Asked if the monks condoned violence, he said: ``If an armed
struggle is demanded to gain the freedom of the people, the Bhikku
Federation does approve and will participate in it.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Backs Higher Fines for Corporate Crimes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Monday it
supported a ten-fold increase in the maximum fine for criminal
antitrust violations by corporations to $10 million.
   The department, noting it is conducting more than 150 grand jury
investigations of alleged criminal antitrust violations, said an
increase was needed to deter price fixing, bid rigging and unlawful
attempts by corporations to control the market on certain products.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement that he
supported legislation pending in Congress that would increase the
maximum fine from $1 million to $10 million for corporate antitrust
violations.
   ``This increase in penalties will send a strong signal to those
who intend to defraud American consumers or the federal government
through criminal antitrust conspiracies that the Justice Department
takes their criminal conduct most seriously and will see that they
are appropriately punished,'' Thornburgh said.
   He issued the statement on the eve of a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing on antitrust issues.
   The proposal to increase the maximum corporate fine was
contained in legislation sponsored by Sens. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   James F. Rill, the new assistant attorney general in charge of
the Justice Department'santitrust division, is scheduled to testify
at Tuesday's hearing.
   Rill noted in a statement that ``it has been 15 years since
criminal fines for coprorate antitrust offenders were raised, and a
sizeable increase in fines now is a good way to underscore that
this criminal activity will not be tolerated.''
   The fines apply to criminal antitrust violations such as price
fixing and bid rigging, which Rill noted is ``undertaken purely to
defraud its victims and has no possible economic justification.''
   Rill, noting that the antitrust division is conducting more than
150 grand jury investigations of suspected criminal violations,
said current fines ``do not appear to be adequately deterring this
unlawful conduct.''

   A slight tremor shook the U.S.
Virgin Islands Monday and was felt in neighboring Puerto Rico, the
Geophysical Institute said. No damage or casualties were reported.
   The quake had a 4.9 magnitude on the Richter scale and was
centered 25 miles northwest of the island of St. Thomas, said
William McCan of the institute.
   McCan said the institute received calls from Puerto Rico
residents saying they also felt the tremor.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage in the local area and an earthquake measuring 5 on the scale
can cause considerable damage.

   State-run TV on Monday broadcast the government's
first documentary account of the events leading up to its bloody
suppression of pro-democracy protests in early June.
   The first hour of the four-part series, ``A Test of Blood and
Fire,'' was as remarkable for what it left out as for what it
included.
   It didn't show the students singing the national anthem, which
they did constantly.
   It also didn't show posters attacking corruption and nepotism,
or banners proclaiming the protesters' love for China.
   Footage shown in the program, unlike earlier official reports,
did show Premier Li Peng hanging in effigy and banners mocking
senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   In the first two weeks after the crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators June 3-4 that left hundreds or perhaps thousands
dead, state-run TV repeatedly showed angry crowds stoning troops
and setting army vehicles on fire. Monday's was the first official
documentary account of the events leading up to June 3 that
purported to put the student movement into perspective.
   Some events in the documentary were shown out of sequence,
apparently to strengthen the government's argument that the student
marches were instigated by anti-communist intellectuals.
   Dissident intellectuals, who remained on the sidelines until the
last stages of the protests, were portrayed as speaking to students
much earlier than they did.
   Apparently to support government claims that the student-led
protests were orchestrated many months in advance by dissidents
such as Fang Lizhi, the program began by showing students
discussing democratic reforms at forums last winter.
   Fang and his wife, physics professor Li Shuxian, were shown at
that time speaking to the students. Fang and Li did not appear in
public support of the later protests sparked by the death of former
Communist Party head Hu Yaobang in mid-April.
   After the crackdown, however, they sought refuge in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing. The Chinese government has demanded they be
handed over for arrest.
   Monday's TV program repeatedly accused Hu's successor as
Communist Party head, Zhao Ziyang, of contributing to the
``turmoil'' of the widespread demonstrations.
   Zhao, who was ousted following the crackdown on dissent, has
been accused of supporting the student protests and opposing other
party leaders who wanted to quash them.
   Public criticism of Zhao has mounted steadily since his June 24
ouster from his party posts. Several reports of comments Zhao
allegedly made at closed meetings have been cited to prove his
softness on Western-style liberalism, which the government blames
for the student movement.
   An editorial Monday in the newspaper Liberation Army Daily
accused Zhao of supporting ``words and deeds that vilified
Marxism'' and spreading non-Marxist theories. It did not give any
specifics.

   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
became chairman of the Organization of African Unity on Monday and
said his top priority is to seek an end to regional conflicts.
   In a speech to the opening session of the three-day summit,
Mubarak also urged the 50-nation group to work together to confront
``racist aggression'' by South Africa and ease Africa's debt
problem.
   Mubarak called for the ``enhancement of solidarity for the
settlement of the current disputes between various states.''
   He mentioned no specific conflicts, but he clearly was referring
to the border dispute between Chad and Libya, the war between
Morocco and the Polisario Front over control of the Western Sahara
and recent ethnic clashes among residents of Senegal and Mauritania.
   Mubarak did not make any reference to the civil wars in Sudan,
Ethiopia, Somalia and Mozambique that have taken hundreds of
thousands of lives.
   The OAU traditionally does not meddle in what are considered the
internal affairs of its members, although many African nations take
the view that the rebels battling the government in Mozambique are
inspired and backed by South Africa.
   Mubarak was elected by acclamation to lead the OAU for the
coming year, succeeding President Moussa Traore of Mali. The
chairmanship alternates each year between Arab and black African
states.
   The Egyptian president pledged to ``confront firmly and
tenaciously the racist aggression'' of South Africa, which he
accused of trying to undermine Namibia's transition toward
independence and enslaving its own black people through apartheid,
its policy of racial segregation.
   Mubarak listed Africa's economic problems as his third priority,
saying they ``constitute a serious danger which not only threatens
to stifle development'' but ``also threatens our very existence and
survival.''
   As he has before, he urged a resumption of talks between the
impoverished nations of Africa and South America and the northern
industrialized countries.
   Mubarak also said he would seek greater cooperation between the
Arab states of the Middle East and Africa, saying they share the
same principles, values and goals.
   Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told the
session that he was encouraged by progress toward ending South
African rule of Namibia.
   But he said some provisions of the independence plan ``have not
been fully respected'' by South Africa. He specifically cited the
incorporation of some members of a disbanded South African
counterinsurgency force known as Koevoet into the legitimate
South-West Africa police force.
   He said the U.N. peacekeeping force in the region ``has clearly
established'' that former Koevoet members were intimidating
civilians in an apparent attempt to influence scheduled elections
this fall.
   Perez de Cuellar said there ``had been a reduction of
intimidation in recent days, but this is not enough. ... There must
be full compliance'' with the independence plan.
   He made no reference to an earlier OAU call for an increase in
the U.N. peacekeeping force, a call repeated in another speech
Monday by Sam Njuma, the leader of the South-West Africa People's
Organization. SWAPO has been battling South Africa for Namibia's
independence for 25 years.
   Perez de Cuellar reportedly rejected any increase in the
peacekeeping force after talks with Njuma in Lusaka, Zambia, late
last week.
   Former President Jimmy Carter was scheduled to arrive in Addis
Ababa at the end of the week to mediate between the Ethiopian
government and Eritrean rebels, who have engaged in one of the
world's longest wars. Both sides have accepted Carter as a
go-between, and the Ethiopian conflict also was expected to be the
subject of a series of private talks at the OAU meeting.

<HEAD>GAO Says Pentagon Fails to Test Planes for Impacts with Birds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite losing nine military aircraft and six
crew members to bird collisions over a five-year period, the
Pentagon still fails to test its planes to see whether they can
withstand such impacts, congressional investigators said Monday.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigating agency for
Congress, reported that from 1983 through 1987 more than 16,000
collisions occurred. While most caused only minor damage, nine
planes _ including a $250 million B-1B bomber _ crashed after
colliding with birds. Losses for the period totaled $318 million.
   ``If our military aircraft are not ready for birds, how can they
be ready for combat?'' asked Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who
requested the study for the House Government Operations Committee,
which he heads.
   ``The GAO did not ask us for a comment and we haven't even seen
it,'' said Jan Bodanyi, a Pentagon spokeswoman, when asked for
reaction to the report.
   The report's release coincided with opening of House and Senate
consideration of the future of the new-generation B-2 stealth
bomber, at $530 million each the most expensive airplane ever built.
   ``With more expensive aircraft coming into use, such as the B-1B
and B-2, the value of these losses could become more significant,''
the GAO said.
   The investigators found that specifications are inconsistent for
the ability of airplanes and engines to withstand bird collisions.
Where there are specifications for engines, the testing does not
accurately reflect the sizes and numbers of birds normally sucked
into jet engines, GAO said.
   The military agency has no testing program to see how well
airframes _ the plane's body and wings, particularly leading edges
_ stand up to bird collisions, investigators said.
   The report suggested requiring in government contracts that
adequate testing be done, and having the Pentagon enforce that
requirement, as a way to reduce unnecessary costs.

<TEXT>
   The knife-scraped skeletal remains of
cannibal Alferd Packer's victims have been taken to the University
of Arizona for study in an attempt to shed more light on the old
story.
   Packer came out of the Rockies near Lake City in 1874 and said
he had subsisted on the remains of five prospecting companions to
make it through the winter.
   The remains of the five were found later that year and buried
near here.
   Anthropologists, who spent a week recovering the bones from a
graveyard on Deadman's Gulch, said evidence already indicated that
one of the men had been shot and several of the bones had been
scraped with a knife. The scholars have taken on the challenge to
see if they can determine the real story through scientific
detection and see if Packer was wrongly convicted.
   The recovery crew left Sunday with the remains.
   Packer, who was sent to prison after being convicted of
manslaughter in the deaths of each man, told authorities he shot
only one of the men and hit him in the head with a hatchet in self
defense.
   Packer said the man had killed the four others with a hatchet.
   Wallace Birkby, curator of physical anthopology at the
University of Arizona, said a bullet hole was found in a right
pelvic bone Saturday, supporting Packer's story that he'd shot one
of the men in self defense. The bullet hole indicated that the man
had been shot from the front.
   Birkby said two of the skulls were recovered almost complete and
other damaged skulls would be reconstructed to see if they will
account for at least a partial fifth victim.
   Scrape marks on the bones of two skeletons indicated they'd been
cut and scraped, or ``defleshed,'' Birkby said.
   Punch marks found in a pelvic bone indicated an animal also had
eaten from one of the remains after the spring thaw of 1874, he
added.
   The project includes forensic anthropologists, a forensic
pathologist and an expert on fibers and tool marks on bones.
   Birkby said a laboratory study should indicate whether any of
the scraped bones had been cooked over a fire.

   President Bush honored 104 people and
organizations with ``Take Pride in America'' awards Monday for
helping preserve the great outdoors.
   ``America can only be as beautiful as her people are vigilant,''
Bush said during an outdoor ceremony at the White House.
   Borrowing a line from the poet Walt Whitman, Bush said ``Today
each of you is helping America sing, through your caring and your
sacrifice, and through deeds that are making America a more
pristine and glorious place.''
   The winners included businesses, civic groups, schools and
individuals, as well as government projects.
   He singled out volunteers in Page, Ariz., who ``rally every year
to clean up the nearby Glen Canyon Recreation Area and Navajo
Reservation,'' and a 4-H Club called the High Country Cactus
Kickers that help preserve archaeological sites in Craig, Colo.
   The awards program is a public-private partnership, with the
federal effort spearheaded by the Interior Department. The number
of winners has tripled since it began two years ago.
   Addressing a crowd of several hundred people on the South Lawn,
Bush said his wife, Barbara, the campaign's honorary chairwoman,
shares his love for the outdoors, although ``she might feel that
she's a fishing widow at times.''
   Actually, Bush said, ``she, too, loves to fish. In fact, she's
the only person I know who can read and fish at the same time.''
   He added, to groans, ``You might call it reading between the
lines.''
   Bush also quipped, ``Only in Washington could they call the
office that manages the great outdoors the Department of the
Interior.''
   Country singer Lee Greenwood, who was master of ceremonies for
the event, got to sing ``God Bless the USA'' on the White House
lawn for the second time in four days. He also performed at Bush's
picnic for astronauts last Thursday.
   Perhaps preaching to the choir, Greenwood told the crowd at the
end: ``Remember, the White House grounds belong to us all. Put your
trash in designated containers.''

<TEXT>
   An international peace and disarmament
conference began on a discordant note Monday when two Chinese
delegates walked out after Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov called
for condemnation of China's crackdown on student protesters.
   ``We cannot forgive or disregard the conduct of the Chinese
government and we must find ways to demonstrate this attitude,''
the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner said at the opening session of
the 39th Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs.
   The Chinese delegates waited outside the conference room during
Sakharov's 45-minute speech, which was largely devoted to Soviet
economic and environmental problems. Then one of them, Professor
Shi Zhongben of Beijing University, confronted the 68-year-old
human rights activist.
   Trembling with emotion, Shi said Sakharov did not understand
Chinese affairs and had chosen an inappropriate forum for his
criticism. Sakharov remained impassive.
   ``Maybe I don't understand all the complexities of the situation
in China, but I think I was right,'' he said later.
   ``We can build peace through international cooperation _ not by
interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,'' said Shi.
   About 200 scientists and statesmen from more than 30 countries
are attending the five-day conference, being held in the United
States for the first time in 19 years.
   The Pugwash conferences grew out of a 1955 statement by Bertrand
Russell and Albert Einstein calling on scientists of all political
persuasions to devise ways to avoid nuclear war. The first
conference was held in 1957 at Pugwash, Nova Scotia.
   Most of the sessions are devoted to technical arms control
issues and are closed to the public. Sakharov spoke during the
plenary session, which was also addressed by Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   Sakharov, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the
1950s, later spoke out against Soviet human rights abuses and the
war in Afghanistan. He was banished to internal exile in the
industrial city of Gorky from 1979 to 1986, when he was personally
called back to Moscow by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Only in
the past year has he been allowed to travel to the West.
   After the Chinese Army crushed the pro-democracy protest in
Beijing's Tianenmen Square on June 3-4 _ with estimates of deaths
running as high as 3,000 _ the new Soviet Congress issued a guarded
statement calling it ``an internal matter.''
   But Sakharov, who is a member of the Congress, told the Pugwash
delegates ``we cannot pretend that nothing took place ... The world
cannot deal with this Chinese government the way it has in the
past.''
   Speaking through a translator, Sakharov compared the violence in
China to the Soviet Army's use of poison gas and sharpened shovels
to disperse a nationalist demonstration in Soviet Georgia in April,
killing at least 20 people. He said both events showed the dangers
faced by democracy movements around the world.
   Shi, the senior Chinese delegate, stood up about halfway through
the speech, as soon as Sakharov made the remarks about China. He
was quickly followed by the second delegate, Niu Qiang of the
Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament.
   Two other Chinese delegates kept their seats in another part of
the room, but it was unclear whether they did so deliberately or
failed to notice the departure of Shi and Niu.
   Despite the incident, Shi and Niu said they planned to attend
the rest of the conference, which will explore ways to convert
warmer East-West relations into practical agreements on arms
control and verification.
   M. Innas Ali, a nuclear physicist from Bangladesh, said
Sakharov's confrontation with the Chinese did not dampen the
optimism of most delegates, who believe the time is ripe for arms
accords.
   Dukakis and Kerry urged the delegates to take advantage of the
Soviet-American rapprochement.
   ``It may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said Dukakis,
the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for president.

<TEXT>
   Officials and supporters of the new
National Opera were reeling Monday from the death of Martti
Talvela, the country's leading opera star, who had agreed to take
over as director.
   The 54-year-old singer, whose bass voice had boomed through
opera houses from La Scala to the Metropolitan, died Saturday. One
colleague on Monday called him ``the father figure of Finnish
opera.''
   News reports said Talvela died during the wedding dance of his
youngest daughter on his farm in Juva, near Savonlinna in eastern
Finland. They indicated he died of a heart attack.
   His family refused to discuss the cause of death or funeral
arrangements.
   Two months before his death, Talvela agreed to become director
of the National Opera in 1992 after the opera house is finished.
   Talvela said his aim would be to make the Finnish opera ``on a
par with the best in Europe.''
   Alfons Almi, a leading figure behind the plan to build a new
opera, said Talvela was the only real candidate for director.
   ``The directorship was tailor-made for Talvela. He is
irreplaceable,'' Almi said in a newspaper interview Monday.
   Roger Lindberg, a member of the committee to select a new
director, described Talvela's death as a ``catastrophe'' for the
National Opera. ``It will be very difficult to find a suitable new
director,'' Lindberg said.
   Talvela, born Feb. 4, 1935, began his international singing
career after winning a contest in Vaasa, west Finland, in 1960. He
had trained to be a school teacher and singing was just a hobby.
   He then studied singing in Stockholm. After a breakthrough at
the Bayreuth Wagner festival, he was signed by the West Berlin
Deutsche Opera.
   During his career, Talvela performed more abroad than in
Finland. In addition to the Metropolitan Opera of New York and
Milan's La Scala, his stages have included the Moscow Bolshoi and
the Vienna National Opera.
   He was said to have sung all the major opera roles for bass
voices. He was particularly acclaimed for his interpretation of the
title role of Mussorgsky's opera ``Boris Godunov.''
   Talvela was artistic director of the annual Savonlinna Opera
Festival from 1972 to 1979. He elevated the festival to a major
international opera event.
   Walton Gronroos, current artistic director of the festival, said
Talvela's ``uncompromising nature was precisely the reason why he
was able to create such great art.''
   ``In Talvela, we have lost a visionary, the father figure of
Finnish opera,'' Gronroos said.
   Not long before he died, Talvela was asked about his reputed
stubborn streak. ``Nobody can ever force me to do anything, but I
am always prepared to negotiate,'' he said.
   When not working, Talvela spent much of his time at his summer
retreat in Juva, where he tended a flock of 100 sheep.
   Talvela is survived by his wife of 32 years, Annukka, and by
three adult children.

   Pipe bombs blasted an Army
recruiting station and a U.S. post office Monday, authorities said.
A telephone caller claimed the two bombs were planted by a
pro-independence group.
   There were no reports of injuries from the blasts, which came on
the eve of Puerto Rico Constitution Day. The holiday celebrates the
37-year-old Constitution that made the island a U.S. commonwealth.
   A series of similar bomb attacks have struck the island in
recent months.
   Monday's caller told a radio station the bombs were placed by
the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Forces, a little-known group. Police
could not confirm the authenticity of the call.
   The male caller, who did not give his name, said the bombing was
to protest military bases in Puerto Rico and its Commonwealth
status.
   The United States provides defense for Puerto Rico, and its only
military bases are American. The Pentagon has 3,350 active
servicemen on the island, including 2,000 at the Roosevelt Roads
Naval Base on the west coast.
   Police said the Monday's bombs went off at 2 a.m. at the Plaza
Carolina Shopping Center about 10 miles east of metropolitan San
Juan.
   They caused ``considerable'' damage to the Army recruiting
office, the post office and several public telephones, all on the
interior of the shopping center, police said. They also damaged the
administrative offices of the Pueblo Supermarket, which faces the
parking lot.
   Police and FBI agents were investigating.
   Two bombs went off last week at the U.S. post offices in Coamo
and Guayama, municipalities in the island's interior. No injuries
were reported.
   In June, the Borinquen Popular Army, also known as the Los
Macheteros or machete-wielders, claimed responsibility for a bomb
that caused heavy damage but no injuries at an Army recruiting
station and a branch of the Bank of Boston in Bayamon. The town is
about 15 miles northwest of San Juan.
   Borinquen was Puerto Rico's name before the Spanish conquest of
the island in the 16th century. Spain ceded the island to the
United States in 1898.
   Similar explosions, with no injuries and only minor damage,
occurred in June at a U.S. Customs office in the southern city of
Ponce and at a Chase Manhattan Bank branch in Caguas, about 20
miles south of San Juan. No group claimed responsibility for those
blasts.
   Los Macheteros is a militant pro-independence group that has
been relatively inactive in recent years. During the 1970s, it blew
up five National Guard fighter jets worth $47 million and ambushed
a U.S. Navy vehicle, killing two sailors and injuring 10.
   Sixteen suspected members were charged in the $7 million robbery
of a Wells Fargo depot in Hartford, Conn., in 1983. The FBI charges
that the Macheteros intended to use the money to pay for their
campaign to gain independence for Puerto Rico.

<TEXT>
   Government troops Monday launched an
offensive on suspected guerrilla hideouts on the outskirts of the
capital and seized large amounts of weaponry, a spokesman said.
   In Pakistan, U.S.-backed guerrillas said government fighter jets
blasted villages north of Kabul after residents refused to pressure
guerrillas to open a key stretch of highway used to carry in
supplies from the Soviet Union.
   Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said
soldiers conducted search operations at four areas to the west,
east and southwest of Kabul.
   ``The operation is still continuing and our brave soldiers are
successfully recovering arms and ammunition,'' he said. Mortar
shells, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, rockets and ammunition
were recovered, he said.
   Amani did not mention any fighting during the operation.
   The offensive comes after the Moslem guerrillas launched 19
rockets into the city over the weekend, killing 46 people and
wounding 121 others.
   At least 43 people were killed Saturday when the guerrillas
launched eight rockets. The barrage resumed Sunday when 11 rockets
landed in the city, killing three people.
   Also Monday, a bomb exploded in a restaurant in the city center,
injuring at least seven people.
   Mohammad Faizullah, a restaurant employee said the bomb made a
deep crater on the floor, shattered window panes and destroyed
furniture.
   ``Had the bomb exploded during lunch or dinner time, many people
would have died,'' he said. The blast took place in the afternoon,
he said, when few people were in the restaurant.
   The guerrillas were believed responsible for the explosion, but
no arrests were reported.
   Fazle Akbar, of the pro-rebel Afghan Information and
Documentation Centre in Pakistan, said that since Friday,
government planes blasted the villages of Shakardara, Mir Bacha Kot
and Qara Bagh, along a 35 mile stretch of the Salang Highway north
of the Afghan capital.
   There was no estimate of damage or casualty figures and the
report could not be independently confirmed.
   Akbar said the attacks came after Afghan President Najib, in a
meeting Friday, was unable to persuade elders from villages north
of Kabul to put pressure on the guerrillas to stop attacking supply
convoys.
   The guerrillas, also based in neighboring Iran, have been
fighting the Soviet-backed government for the past 11 years.
   They control most of the countryside and the government's army
has maintained control of the cities after a Soviet troop pullout
was completed in February.
   At least 1 million Afghans have been killed in the war.

<TEXT>
   Burmese forces launched a fierce
assault on ethnic Karen rebels near the Thai border, but they were
forced to retreat, Thai police said Monday. At least 44 people were
reported killed.
   The border police and Karen sources said the dead included 42
government soldiers. They said only two rebels were killed and one
was wounded.
   The attack was the heaviest and most sustained since Burmese
troops began their assault on the Karen base of Kaw Moo Ra in May,
the police said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Burmese troops began pounding the base with mortar fire Saturday
before launching the infantry assault, police said. They pulled
back Sunday after taking heavy casualties, they said.
   Police said the camp, about five miles from the Thai border town
of Mae Sot, is defended by about 1,200 Karens. There was no
indication how many Burmese troops were involved in the attack.
   The Karens, with about 8,000 fighters, are the largest of 12
ethnic minority groups that have fought a four-decade war for
greater autonomy from the central government.
   Kaw Moo Ra, situated along a curve of the Moei River, can be
attacked from Burma only with artillery or by a frontal assault on
a well-defended 250-yard strip of land between the two bends in the
river.
   Thai gunners fired 15 warning shots at a Burmese government
mortar base in hills near the camp after about 80 mortar rounds
fell inside Thai territory at the village of Ban Wang Kaew, police
said.
   Burmese troops burned the Thai village at the end of May, when
they intruded into Thailand to attack Kaw Moo Ra from the rear.
   Last year, the Burmese army began a campaign to dislodge the
Karens from riverbank strongholds where they have controlled
cross-border trade. Burmese troops have seized five key bases since
December.
   The Burmese government wants to clear routes through
Karen-controlled territory to allow the passage of export goods,
mainly timber, into Thailand.
   The Karens say the government has paid a heavy price for its
victories. They claim to have killed at least 2,000 government
soldiers and wounded 4,000. They gave no total for their own
casualties.
   Thai border forces said earlier in the campaign that Karen
casualties were much lighter than those of the government.

   Chicago Mayor Richard Daley paid a brief
social call on President Bush on Monday and pledged to work with
the federal government in tackling problems in his city and
elsewhere.
   Daley, who was accompanied by his wife, Maggie, and his three
children on the visit to the Oval Office, said he told Bush ``I
will be working with him on many problems, whether it's housing or
narcotics.''
   Daley, a Democrat who took office in April, said he does not
want political differences to stand in the way of achieving his
goal of building a better Chicago.
   Although Daley said Bush did not promise Chicago any special
favors, he said the meeting helped solidify a personal relationship.
   Bush, according to Daley, talked about his family and mentioned
that Daley's father, the legendary former mayor of Chicago, was a
``great political leader.''
   Last week, Daley said he met in Washington with a number of
Cabinet secretaries, including those for housing, transportation
and education.

<TEXT>
   Army investigators Monday tried to
find the cause of a helicopter crash that killed six men during
desert training exercises.
   There was no immediate word on whether the pilot of the UH-60
Blackhawk helicopter was wearing night-vision goggles of a type
that has been criticized as a safety threat, said Maj. John
Wagstaffe, a base spokesman.
   The helicopter crashed at 4 a.m. Saturday as its crew was
directing other aircraft in a mock attack in the Mojave Desert.
   ``It is standard procedure for crews to wear night vision
goggles while on missions of that type here,'' said Wagstaffe.
``But whether this crew was wearing them will have to be determined
by the investigation.''
   The goggles have come under criticism recently because, among
other things, they significantly narrow a pilot's field of vision.
They were originally designed for ground troop use.
   The goggles were used by pilots during crashes that have killed
150 servicemen and destroyed 69 helicopters since 1978, according
to one newspaper investigation.
   Three officers and three non-commissioned officers died in the
crash. A corporal suffered a broken leg, the Pentagon said.
   All the soldiers aboard were from the 1st Cavalry Division at
Fort Hood, Texas. They were at the 1,000-square-mile base for a
three-week exercise that coincidentally ended Saturday.
   The accident occurred while 1st Cavalry troops waged mock battle
against units posing as Soviet forces at Fort Irwin's National
Training Center, with the Blackhawk crew directing two Apache AH-64
assault helicopters.
   A team from the U.S. Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala.,
will be on the scene for at least a week, and the investigation
will likely conclude in three to four months, said Safety Center
spokesman Lt. Col. Herb Blanks in a telephone interview.
   The Safety Center has the power to ground the $4.6 million
UH-60, but they remained flying on Monday.
   The Army's fleet of 820 UH-60s was grounded twice in May 1987,
once for inspection and once because of a design flaw. The entire
fleet also was grounded in April 1985 and March 1986 after fatal
crashes. In 1985, the Army identified a defect in the main rotor
assembly and ordered it corrected.
   Blanks said the crash was the fourth of a UH-60 since October.
There were five such accidents last fiscal year, he said, adding:
``There is no abnormal trend, not when you consider the amount of
hours they fly.''
   The colonel said no repeated structural flaws have been found.
   ``The majority of our accidents are human error,'' he said.
   The two-engine Blackhawk is designed as a utility and assault
aircraft. It normally is operated with a crew of three and can
carry 11 combat-equipped soldiers.
   It is made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a division of United
Technologies based in Stratford, Conn.
   At the Pentagon, those killed in the crash were identified as
Lt. Col. William C. Whittingstall, 40, Iowa Park, Texas; Capt.
Marlon D. Joseph, 33, Houston; 1st Lt. Robert B. Wilson, 26,
Dumfries, Va.; Chief Warrant Officer 4 Roy A. Westbrook, 42,
Poteet, Texas; Chief Warrant Officer 3 Adelbert L. Morrow, 41,
Hemet, Calif.; and Staff Sgt. Stephen P. Thompson, 28, Sacramento,
Calif.
   The injured soldier was identified as Scott A. Matthews, 24, of
Corpus Christi, Texas.

   Hungary's top Communist Party leaders arrived
Monday to inform Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev about plans
for multiparty elections, according to official reports.
   Rezsoe Nyers and Karoly Grosz were invited by the Soviet
Communist Party after a change in the Hungarian party leadership
last month. The party set up a four-man presidium dominated by
reformers and elevated Nyers to the newly influential post of party
chairman. Grosz maintained his position as party general secretary.
   Grosz is responsible for internal party matters, and Nyers is
responsible for the party's foreign relations.
   Nyers met with Gorbachev this month in Bucharest at a meeting of
the seven Warsaw Pact countries.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry's deputy spokesman, Vadim Perfilyev,
said the talks were part of an increasingly frequent discussion of
reforms in the two countries.
   In Moscow, the Hungarians will inform Gorbachev about Hungary's
decision to allow a pluralistic system, according to a foreign
policy aide to Grosz, Gyula Thurmer.
   The party is negotiating with the opposition on the first
multiparty elections since the Communists consolidated power in
1948. Elections are due by June 1990.
   In Budapest, Thurmer told the party newspaper Nepszabadsag the
visit was aimed at exchanging information on recent developments in
the Soviet Union and Hungary.
   ``It is worth examining how the processes taking place in the
two countries strengthen each other,'' Thurmer said. ``The Soviet
party shows understanding toward the introduction of a multiparty
system in Hungary.''
   On Saturday, the first opposition candidate in more than 41
years was elected in a local by-election to Hungary's
Communist-dominated Parliament.
   Grosz and Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth _ also elevated to the
party four-man presidium along with reformer Imre Pozsgay _ visited
Moscow in March and returned with assurances of Kremlin support for
Hungary's reforms.
   Reforms began earlier in Hungary and have progressed further
than in the Soviet Union, making it both a laboratory for economic
and social experiments in the Soviet bloc and an occasional source
of worry for Moscow over whether they are going too far.
   Visiting Budapest this month, President Bush also expressed
support for Hungary's reforms but emphasized that he did not wish
to interfere.
   Thurmer said Bush's Budapest visit would also be discussed in
Moscow.

<TEXT>
   A city that has trouble paying for
trash collection has been billed for hundreds of unauthorized
long-distance telephone calls.
   The cash-starved city's monthly bills average $5,000 and include
calls to virtually every state, the Belleville (Ill.) News-Democrat
reported Sunday.
   Many phones in the police and maintenance departments logged
calls to ``900'' prefix lines, the paper said.
   The ``900'' lines are used by dial-a-porn and adult talk
services, as well as by businesses conducting polls or giving out
product and other information. None of the ``900'' numbers on city
bills was in service when called by the paper.
   Treasurer Charlotte Moore said the number of questionable calls
in each month's two-inch-thick bill shows the need for an internal
auditor.
   ``After I suggested it to the (aldermanic) council two years
ago, they cut my staff in half,'' she said. A continuing cash
crunch has made it hard for the city to pay salaries and collect
garbage in recent months.
   In a review of bills from March, April and May, the paper found
hundreds of dollars worth of calls from Texas, Florida and other
places were charged to the city either by reversing the charges or
by using a city credit card number.
   Many outgoing calls from City Hall were equally questionable.
There were calls to a trivia line that gives callers a chance to
win prizes, to the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas, and to a pay phone in
a St. Louis hospital.
   And there were at least 16 calls from a St. Louis number to the
beeper of a man convicted on Friday on charges of running a cocaine
ring.

   President Bush said Monday he will nominate
Michael P.W. Stone, the undersecretary of the Army, to assume the
top job as secretary of the service.
   Stone, 64, a member like Bush of the Yale University class of
1948, would succeed John O. Marsh Jr., if confirmed by the Senate.
   Since 1988, Stone has served as the undersecretary of the Army,
and for two years before that was the assistant secretary of the
Army for financial management.
   Stone had a long career as a businessman, primarily in
California, before he joined the Agency for International
Development in 1982 as the head of its mission in Cairo, Egypt. He
also directed AID's Caribbean Basin Initiative Affairs in 1984.
   From 1964 until 1982, Stone was president and director of
Sterling Vineyards in Napa Valley, Calif. From 1960 until 1977, he
was president of Sterling International.
   He also served as assistant to the president of Utah
International Co. in San Francisco, 1957-1959; as associate with
McKinsey and Co., 1954-1957 and president of Howard Rotavator Co.
in Arlington Heights, Ill., 1950-1954.
   Stone, who is married with two children, served in the U.S. Navy
from 1943 to 1946.

   President Bush still stands behind William
Lucas, his embattled nominee to be the Justice Department's top
civil rights enforcer, the White House said Monday.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush chose the Detroit lawyer as
``someone who would be a fighter for civil rights; a black person
who understood the black experience.''
   He said Lucas also was ``someone who knew urban problems,
someone who was willing to take charge in that job and do it with
aggressiveness and forcefulness. We think Bill Lucas will do that.''
   The former sheriff of Wayne County, Mich., is opposed by many
civil rights groups who claim he lacks experience to be assistant
attorney general for civil rights. They also have criticized his
defense of recent Supreme Court decisions on civil rights.
   Several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which could
vote on the nomination as early as Thursday, expressed doubts about
Lucas following his testimony at confirmation hearings last week.
   A prominent black in the House, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,
withdrew his support for the nominee following the hearing.
   And Jesse Jackson on Monday urged Judiciary Committee Chairman
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., to reject Lucas as being ``unsuitable''
for the post.
   Jackson, in a letter to Biden, said he considered Lucas an
``outstanding person and family man,'' but without qualifications
to run a major legal operation.
   ``Today, racial discrimination is defended, not by dogs and
hoses, but by onerous burdens of proof, severe statutes of
limitations, discovery restrictions and procedural trickery. ... We
don't need someone who has never performed surgery operating on the
civil rights of the American people.''
   Jackson said Lucas, ``could, despite the best of intentions,
seriously harm the cause of civil rights. ... We need an aggressive
response to the cutbacks in civil rights. In my judgment, Mr. Lucas
cannot provide that response.''
   But supporters countered that Lucas' stand on civil rights is
the same as that of Bush and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said criticisms that
Lucas does not have a civil rights background or legal expertise
are ``unjustified'' and ``miss the point.''
   He said the head of the civil rights division has a battery of
lawyers to assist him in court and to free him for the task of
setting civil rights policy.
   ``Ninety percent of the complaints filed with the civil rights
division's criminal section involve police misconduct. Who in this
country is better equipped than Bill Lucas _ the former policeman,
FBI agent and county sheriff _ to deal with these tough issues with
real experience,'' Dole said.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowrey, head of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, called the opposition to Lucas ``partisan
and picayune.''
   ``I think he is qualified,'' Lowrey said as he left a meeting
Monday with Thornburgh. ``He has as much courtroom experience as
Bobby Kennedy had when he was nominated to be attorney general over
the whole Department of Justice.''
   Lowrey said he expected Lucas to ``work to alter and influence
the administration's position'' on civil rights once confirmed as
assistant attorney general.
   ``We still think Lucas is a good candidate, an excellent
candidate and should be confirmed, on the basis of his experience,
his ability, the work that he's done, the fact that he has labored
in the vineyards of law enforcement and civil rights, that he knows
these problems from the inside of a big city,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We stand behind the candidate,'' he said.
   Asked about a comment by a Justice Department spokesman, David
Runkel, that civil rights groups opposing the Lucas nomination
``have the most to lose'' from their stance, Fitzwater said Bush
did not plan to hold this against them.
   ``The president made this appointment in good faith. He thinks
it's a good appointment. He expects to maintain good relations with
the civil rights groups no matter what,'' Fitzwater said.
   Lucas has been nominated to the job that William Bradford
Reynolds held in the Reagan administration. Reynolds was Reagan's
point man in implementing Reagan's conservative legal agenda at the
Justice Department. Civil rights groups complained Reynolds
undermined affirmative action.

   Carter High School had a dream football team last
fall, but questions about academic eligibility and the arrest of
several players for robbery have brought more shame than glory to
the school.
   The talented Cowboys were on their way to the state championship
last fall when they were initially disqualified three weeks before
the playoffs. Star senior running back Gary Edwards had allegedly
failed algebra.
   State education officials and the University Interscholastic
League accused Carter Principal C.C. Russeau of changing Edwards'
grade to passing, a charge that Russeau and the Dallas school
superintendent repeatedly denied.
   With a temporary court order, the Cowboys went on to win the
championship, and the matter went to court.
   Then a new bombshell dropped in June: Edwards and another
All-American Cowboy teammate, Derric Evans, were charged in several
armed robberies.
   Next, three other teammates were among five more Carter students
charged in the robberies of small businesses and restaurants.
   A state district judge ruled last Tuesday in favor of Edwards
and the Dallas Independent School District in the grade dispute,
meaning the high school keeps the football title.
   But the criminal charges remain. Edwards and Evans have pleaded
guilty and await sentencing. Cases are pending against the other
players, who include members of the basketball and junior varsity
football teams.
   Now disbelieving parents, students and teammates are struggling
to figure out why athletes with such promise turned to crime. And
some observers say the students were never prepared to handle the
attention created by their success in sports.
   The 1,700-student school sits in a middle-class neighborhood.
The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday that friends and other
students said the arrested players robbed to make up for gambling
losses and because of a hunger for status and money.
   The Carter football players slipped from athletics into friendly
dice games and then into gambling for easy money, students and
adults told the Morning News in a copyright story.
   When the athletes learned that playing dice was also an easy way
to lose money, some turned to armed robbery, the students said.
   Keith Campbell, one of the alleged robbery ringleaders, said
Friday that gambling ``probably'' was the motive for the first
holdups. ``Then,'' he said, ``it went on for kicks.''
   Recouping losses ``wasn't a motivation for me, but it was for
others,'' another player said through his attorney. ``Some of us
just wanted money for partying and buying things.''
   Gambling was so common among athletes at Carter that some
coaches tolerated it and the Student Council, fearing violence,
condemned it, the newspaper said.
   Patrick ``P.K.'' Williams and Carlos Allen, who on Friday
pleaded guilty with Campbell to the group's first holdup, said
through their attorneys that they robbed to win acceptance by their
friends.
   ``He wanted to be held in that high esteem and he had to be as
tough as they were,'' attorney Ted Calisi said of his client,
Allen. ``He did that to stay with the crowd.''
   Derric Evans and Gary Edwards have publicly apolgized for their
deeds.
   ``When I put myself in the position of those I robbed, looking
at a weapon, I can imagine how terrified they felt,'' Evans said at
a news conference.
   Edwards directed part of his statement to his mother and father.
``You don't deserve the disappointment, the embarrasment and the
shame that I've brought on you. I don't expect you to stand behind
me for what I've done, but please find it in your heart to forgive
me,'' he said.
   Kimberly Vaughn, Student Council president, said she hopes
students can put the dark clouds behind them this school year.
   ``If everybody would just let it die, it would make things a lot
easier. We were and still are the brunt of a lot of jokes,'' she
said.
   Carter parent Milton Watkin said the crimes are ``very
unfortunate,'' but don't merit the ``incessant barage of media''
attention, which he called ``sensationalism.''
   Coach Freddie James was vacationing in California last week and
could not be reached by The Associated Press. Russeau did not
return phone calls to the AP.
   Linebacker Jessie Armstead said James was tough on academics and
discipline as well as football and couldn't be blamed for the
misbehavior of his players.
   Edwards' attorney, Royce West, said he thinks the 17-year-old
got involved in the robberies because of pressure over the grade
dispute.
   ``When this controversy started, Gary should have received some
counseling,'' West said.
   He said Edwards is working at a McDonald's restaurant, ``getting
his life back together.'' Because of the criminal charges, Edwards
lost financial aid offered by the University of Houston.
   Dallas sports psychologist Tom McGaffey said the entire team
could have used counseling.
   ``Prominence gives a feeling of power. And if it happens
suddenly and without the development of discipline and
responsibility ... they're in for trouble,'' McGaffey said.
   ``We forget the fact that a 17-year-old or 18-year-old is still
a kid in our culture,'' he said.

   Four thousand live chickens snarled
pre-dawn traffic Monday when the truck trailer carrying them
flipped over on an interstate.
   Hundreds of chickens died. Motorists helped to corral the others.
   Ron Taylor of Tacoma was driving the truck and the birds from
Dallas, Ore., to Tacoma. He said the rear trailer went out of
control and overturned on Interstate 5 as he drove though a
construction zone at a Columbia River bridge.
   The tractor and front trailer remained upright, and Taylor was
uninjured. He was ticketed by the State Patrol for driving too fast
for conditions.
   Motorists stopped and volunteered to help catch the chickens and
remove unbroken crates from the highway.
   ``This is my kind of thing,'' said Mary Turbeville of Vancouver.
``My dad was a farmer. I'm experienced in chicken catching.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has held meetings
with PLO supporters from the occupied territories despite a
government ban on contacts with the outlawed group, Palestinian and
Israeli sources said Monday.
   The reports were denied by Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, and
by Palestinians identified as meeting with Shamir.
   Pazner told The Associated Press the premier ``does not meet
with PLO members and does not conduct negotiations directly or
indirectly with the PLO.''
   He confirmed Shamir has met ``non-PLO Palestinians'' from the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in recent weeks, but said, ``I don't know
what they believe in their hearts.'' He declined to identify the
participants.
   Also on Monday, an Arab attacker shot to death one Palestinian
and wounded another in front of City Hall in Gaza City, Arab
witnesses said. Both victims were suspected of collaborating with
Israel. The army confirmed the shootings but said it was checking
the circumstances.
   In the West Bank, soldiers shot and killed Mohammed Yusef Arda,
22, in a clash between troops and youths in Araba village, Arab
reports said.
   Monday's Gaza attack brings to 84 the number of Palestinians
killed as alleged collaborators during the 19-month uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arda was the 519th Palestinian to die in confrontations with
Israeli troops and civilians. Thirty-eight Israelis also have been
killed.
   In scattered stone-throwing confrontations with troops in the
Gaza Strip, 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers
Monday, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checking
the reports.
   The mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot said senior Soviet official
Gennady Terasov will visit Israel soon to discuss Shamir's peace
plan.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said he could not confirm
the report, but noted Terasov would be the highest-ranking Soviet
to visit since Moscow severed ties with Israel after the 1967
Middle East war. Terasov is Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze's new adviser on Middle East affairs.
   The reports alleging Shamir is meeting pro-PLO activists came as
the premier faces a challenge from hard-liners in his Likud bloc
who fear he will make too many concessions to win approval to hold
elections in the territories to calm the uprising.
   They also surfaced as Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat was quoted in the Rome daily Il Messaggero as saying
the Israeli government has opened direct contacts with his group.
   Arafat also said a PLO executive committee member met recently
in Vienna with an envoy of Shamir. He gave no details.
   The Austrian news agency APA said PLO executive Abdul Razzak
Al-Yahya and Israeli Eli Halali both attended a July 1-2 symposium
in Vienna.
   But Halali, a Likud central committee member, told The
Associated Press: ``I didn't meet with anyone at the Vienna
conference.''
   Palestinian and Israeli sources who demanded anonymity said
Shamir met with Radwan Abu Ayyash, head of the Arab Journalists
Association in the West Bank, and Mansour Al-Shawwa, son of the
late Gaza City Mayor Rashad Al-Shawwa.
   The independent Hebrew daily Maariv said Monday that another of
the Palestinians was attorney Jamil Tarifi from the West Bank town
of Ramallah.
   Haaretz daily reported Shamir met an unidentified east Jerusalem
journalist who supports Arafat's Fatah faction.
   Other reports said the fourth participant was Ramallah
pharmacist Ezziddin Al-Aryan.
   All are known supports of the PLO's mainstream Fatah, and
Al-Aryan is a member of the Palestine National Council, its
parliament-in-exile.
   Al-Shawwa and Al-Aryan both denied meeting Shamir. The others
could not be reached for comment.
   Shamir in April announced a peace plan calling for elections in
the occupied territories to select Palestinians to open talks to
negotiate an interim solution.
   The plan was seen as a vehicle around the government ban on PLO
contacts, since many elected undoubtedly would be PLO backers.
   U.S. officials are trying to persuade Arafat to approve the plan.
   Arafat told Il Messaggero that the PLO approved meetings with
Israeli officials and has been receiving reports on the contacts.
   However, underground leaders of the uprising condemned them.
   ``The unified leadership confirms its rejection of holding any
communications with any official representatives in the Israeli
government and confirms that not one of the national personalities
met with any government officials,'' they said in a leaflet Sunday.

<HEAD>Commodity Spending Less Than Anticipated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal spending on major commodity programs
is down from what administration budget analysts forecast in
January, an Agriculture Department analysis showed Monday.
   Total outlays in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 are now
projected at less than $13.5 billion, about $360 million below the
January prediction.
   Programs include payments to farmers for participating in annual
crop programs. In the case of major crops, such as wheat, corn and
cotton, the programs provide price supports and other benefits in
return for taking land out of production.
   But some other commodities also are covered, including price
support operations for soybeans, peanuts, tobacco, honey, sugar,
dairy products and wool.
   Outlays for corn and other feed grains in 1989 were indicated in
January at about $3.04 billion. The new ``mid-session review''
raised the estimate to $4.17 billion. At the same time, spending
for wheat, rice and upland cotton programs was reduced by more than
$1.3 billion from the January forecast.
   Allowing for adjustments in other programs administered by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp., total spending for the various
agricultural commodities was reduced a net of $86 million to less
than $7.03 billion for this fiscal year.
   Other CCC spending, including $3.75 billion for aid to farmers
who suffered severe losses from the 1988 drought, put the fiscal
1989 total at just under $13.5 billion, compared with the January
estimate of more than $13.8 billion.
   Looking at 1990, the report said total CCC spending could drop
to just over $11.3 billion, down $231 million from what was
projected in January.
   Scott Steele, an Agriculture Department budget analyst, said the
boost in feed-grain outlays from the level initially projected was
a result of new quarterly grain inventory figures in January. Those
showed more feed grain on hand than had been indicated previously.
   It was this larger inventory that ``we did not take into account
when we did the budget'' that was published by the out-going Reagan
administration Jan. 9 and later adopted by President Bush, he said.
   Steele said in an interview that the Jan. 9 projections were
based on supply-and demand readings last November. The new review
took into consideration the grain figures that were issued Jan. 13.
   Looking at fiscal 1990, which will begin Oct. 1, the new report
showed total CCC outlays at less than $11.4 billion, down about
$231 million from what had been projected in January.
   Spending on feed grains in 1989-90 was indicated at nearly $7.07
billion, up from the $5.56 billion projected in January. Declines
from the January projections were shown for wheat, rice and cotton.

<TEXT>
   The governors of eight Atlantic Coast states
met with congressional environmental leaders Monday and then signed
a broadly worded agreement to work for clean oceans.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., acknowledged that the document,
which was passed from governor to governor while homestate
television cameras rolled, ``probably will not take its place
between the Magna Carta and the Mayflower Compact.''
   But he joined other participants at a news conference following
the closed meeting in saying the agreement was a symbolic
achievement that signaled the governors were determined to work
among themselves and with federal officials to solve environmental
problems.
   Standing behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, last year's
Democratic presidential nominee, Studds said it will take billions
of dollars just to clean up Boston Harbor alone and that the main
measure of success for the governors' ``coastal agenda'' will be
``the number of dollars we are able to put behind them.''
   The bipartisan meeting, attended by about a dozen members of
Congress, was arranged by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of
Maine and Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer, also a Democrat.
   The governors of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Virginia,
North Carolina and South Carolina also attended the ceremony.
   The document specifically did not endorse any of the many pieces
of federal legislation pending on environmental issues and
purposely was worded vaguely enough to ensure unanimous support.
   For example, the first section of the five-part plan _ ``Create
an Environmental Ethic'' _ says ``Federal and state policies must
reflect the need for strengthened environmental protection'' and
``Education and public participation must be strenghtened to show
how everyone can participate in the solution to coastal pollution
problems.''
   The document also called for strengthening research and
monitoring of coastal waters; reducing coastal nutrient and toxic
pollution; protection of marine and coastal sediment quality; and
expansion of government authority for oil spill prevention and
response.
   ``This is the beginning,'' Schaefer of the meeting.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said the most important aspect of
the agreement was its call for creation of an environmental ethic
because significant progress will not be made ``until the ethic
becomes strong enough for force funding.''
   Pressed to estimate how much money would be needed to accomplish
the goals of the group, Mitchell said, ``There is no single overall
figure and I think it is a mistake to view it in the context of
those kind of questions.''
   He emphasized that there was no attempt to get the group to
agree on specific legislation and added: ``I think it is very
significant that we got started and got the agreement that we did.''

   The Justice Department has declined to
prosecute a former Department of Housing and Urban Development
official in connection with his activities for a charity whose
donors included many developers who did business with HUD.
   The decision was made last week but not disclosed until Monday
when a copy of a Justice Department letter informing HUD's
inspector general of the decision was released by a congressman.
   In the letter, the department said it has declined to prosecute
Thomas T. Demery for any actions detailed in the inspector
general's April report on the agency's Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program.
   The report detailed numerous instances in which former HUD
officials have reaped benefits from the program either as
developers or consultants and said many other developers who won
lucrative subsidies under the program were donors to FOOD for
Africa, a Michigan-based charity Demery helped found.
   HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams told Congress recently that
he found no evidence of criminal activity during his office's
review of the program.
   But the inspector general referred the report to the Justice
Department's Public Integrity Section for a review of whether
Demery violated HUD's conduct standards by associating himself with
the charity, including occasional references to his official
position on invitations to FOOD for Africa events.
   Demery has repeatedly denied any connection between his HUD
decisions and donations to the charity. Attempts to reach him
Monday for comment were not immediately successful.
   In releasing the July 19 letter, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
said he was not criticizing the department for declining to
prosecute Demery but took issue with a passage in the letter he
said indicated the department would not independently investigate
abuses at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   ``Should you come to obtain information not contained in your
report implicating Mr. Demery or other HUD officials in possible
criminal violations we would be happy to review that information,''
Public Integrity Section Chief Gerald E. McDowell said in the
passage Frank referred to.
   ``Call me if you find anything wrong,'' Frank said was the
attitude the Justice Department was adopting.
   He praised new HUD Secretary Jack Kemp for seeking to reform the
agency but added: ``Elsewhere in the Bush administration we are not
getting the same kind of commitment to clean this mess up.''

   A special team of investigators is looking
into how so many passengers survived the DC-10 crash in Iowa, with
an eye to increasing the chances of both adults and children of
living through a crash.
   The ``survival factors team'' led by National Transportation
Safety board investigators has interviewed 26 of United Airlines
Flight 232's passengers so far, NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz
said Monday.
   Most were among those still hospitalized after Wednesday's crash
landing in Sioux City that killed 111 people, Lopatkiewicz said.
   Questionnaires will be sent to all adults among the 185
survivors, the investigation spokesman said in a telephone
interview from Sioux City.
   Lopatkiewicz said the team will ``document the survivability of
the accident'' and try to find out what precautions were most
effective in preventing injury and death when the jetliner burst
into flames, flipped over, landed on its back and split apart in a
cornfield near the Sioux City airport.
   The team will try to interview all adults traveling with
children to see what happened to the youngsters after the pilot
told passengers to prepare for a crash landing.
   Among concerns to be addressed, he said, is the fact that
several infants were traveling free in their parents' arms without
assigned seats _ a common practice on domestic flights.
   At least one infant was among the dead, United said.
   Lopatkiewicz said investigators have not determined exactly how
many of the passengers on Flight 232 from Denver to Chicago were
children or infants or how many children were among the dead.
   A list compiled by The Associated Press shows 24 children under
10 years old, including seven under 5, among the survivors.
   The safety board in 1983 recommended that standards be adopted
for infants' seats on airliners. In 1984 the Federal Aviation
Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration drew up standards for seats that can be used in both
airliners and cars, but they are not required.
   In addition to board employees, the survival factors team
includes members from the Federal Aviation Administration, the
airline, the engine manufacturer, General Electric Co., the
aircraft manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas Corp., and others
participating in the overall inquiry.

<TEXT>
   China's ambassador to the United
States appealed Monday for patience and understanding of turmoil in
his homeland, but warned that China doesn't tolerate pressure or
interference.
   ``At present, the important thing is not to interfere in China's
internal affairs, particularly when it is in difficulty. Do not
make things more difficult,'' Ambassador Han Xu told a packed
luncheon meeting of the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches.
   Han said the public comments were his first ``since those
terrible developments occurred in China,'' referring to bloody
student uprisings in Tiananmen Square seven weeks ago.
   He also said they would be his last public comments as
ambassador. At age 65 and after two decades of active involvement
in U.S.-China relations, he said he is retiring and will soon retur
to Beijing.
   Han said he would leave the United States with mixed feelings,
but remained confident that the dramatic progress in relations
between the two countries would survive the current strain. He said
Beijing has shown restraint in reacting to U.S. sanctions over the
Chinese government's quelling of the protests.
   Chinese officials have said 300 people died during the
crackdown, but witnesses and Western intelligence sources say the
number was in the thousands. The government has also executed
dozens of people who allegedly participated.
   ``Where the question of state sovereignty is concerned, China
always stands firm. To put pressure on China is not the way to talk
business.
   ``It is unwise. It never works, and it can only end up hurting
the mutual interests of both countries,'' Han said.
   ``There is much talk of imposing further economic sanctions
against China,'' he added. ``Such sanctions must be firmly
rejected. They hurt the United States as much as they hurt China.
The only effect on China that I can think of is that would push
back China into the isolation of the old days. I am sure that it is
not a prospect that you want to see.''
   Han, ambassador since 1985, said he didn't expect to make many
converts to his government's view of the uprisings, which it
characterizes as the work of a very small traitorous mob.
   Han said Americans and others should look at the context of the
turmoil. China is undergoing massive economic reforms, trying to
overcome backward industry, illiteracy problems, lack of arable
land for its 1.1 billion people and new problems of bureaucratic
corruption and speculators. China has made great economic progress
in the past decade, he said, and that has led to inflation,
increased expectations and economic disparities that also create
political turmoil.
   Because of the changes it is attempting, the Chinese government
``places so much emphasis upon the maintenance of order and unity
and ... must respond vigorously to signs of chaos and turmoil,'' he
said.
   Han said the friendship between Americans and Chinese is
historical and is important to both countries.
   ``Let's be guided by the forces of history and reason from this
time forward. An ancient Chinese wise man once said: `Spilt water
cannot be gathered up.'''
   Han drew 548 people, by far the largest crowd in the Forum
Club's 17-year history, said executive director R.J. Kirkpatrick.
Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami and other
nearby colleges all have Chinese student contingents, and the club
hired several security guards for possible protests.
   ``We have not had even a hint of protest,'' said Kirkpatrick.
``Not oral or otherwise.''
   Henry Feustel, of the local chapter of the Chinese-American
Friendship Association, said displeasure with the Tiananmen Square
violence shouldn't be allowed to ruin relations.
   ``We are all mad, boiling mad,'' he said. ``But you have to look
to the future.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee proposed a plan Monday he said could prevent
influence-peddling situations such as those under investigation at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., wants all those requesting federal
funds to report the name of any lobbyists paid to help get the
government grant, contract, cooperative agreement loan, loan
guarantee or loan insurance.
   If any of the federal money is used to pay someone for personal
influence, unrelated to the merits of the project, the grant or
loan recipient would be fined $100,000.
   ``Had this legislation been in place it would have been a
deterrent in relation to things that happened at HUD,'' said Byrd.
   His proposal was approved Monday by a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee as an amendment to the appropriations bill for the
Interior Department and related agencies.
   It still must be approved by the full committee, the full Senate
and go through a conference committee including members of the
House. It was not part of the House legislation.
   ``This is not an anti-lobbying bill,'' said Byrd.
   It doesn't prohibit payments ``to consultants for professional
or other technical services in connection with meeting
requirements'' for receiving the grants or loans, he said.
   ``But when the consultant goes beyond that to get the contract''
there will be trouble, said Byrd.
   He spoke critically of information he had received about
consultants who are knowledgeable about government programs, design
grant proposals and then go shopping for a university or other
institution willing to apply for the money and pay them for the
proposal.
   Byrd said his plan would affect all government agencies.
   He called the reporting aspect the best part of the plan.
   ``It will alert people up and down the line,'' he said. ``It
establishes a data base that can be analyzed.''
   Twice a year, the federal agencies granting money would be
required to file with the secretary of the Senate and the clerk of
the House complete lists of the lobbyists' names, addresses,
amounts paid and the purposes for which they were paid.
   The lists would be available to the public and will be examined
by the inspector general's office, Byrd said.

<HEAD>Secretary Calls For `Revolution;' Analyst Says Car Still King</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner called
on Monday for a ``revolution in transportation,'' possibly
including high-speed rail systems, but a private analyst said the
car will remain king.
   Skinner launched a series of nationwide hearings aimed at
drawing up a national transportation policy for rail, highway, air
and water travel. Meetings are to be held in large and small cities
throughout the country through mid-September.
   The first one, in a Washington auditorium, featured the heads of
some of the country's biggest airline, railroad and automobile
companies and Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, who said the whole system is a
``handyman's special.''
   If the nation's system of roads, rails, waterways and airports
were listed in a real estate ad, she said, it would say: ``Lots of
potential, oldstyle craftsmanship with many modern conveniences,
but needs work, a real fixer-upper.''
   Skinner, who moderated the first session and will attend some of
the other meetings, said a decision to build high-speed rail
systems is one possible result of the effort. This could include
trains that travel up to 300 mph, particularly between cities where
air travel has reached maximum levels.
   ``It is time for a new revolution in transportation, and
hopefully it will be a peaceful revolution,'' said Skinner.
   In an interview prior to the meeting, Skinner said the nation's
airports, highways, bridges, waterways and mass transit systems are
simply wearing out.
   ``We're going to have to rebuild it and replace it, or we're not
going to be able to rely on it anymore,'' he said.
   Among the most critical problems, Skinner said, are a lack of
planning for new airports and neglect of $80 billion worth of work
needed on deteriorating bridges.
   William B. Johnston, senior research fellow at the Hudson
Institute, told the opening session that no new system is in the
wings that will revolutionize transportation within the next 25
years, so old systems have to be made more efficient.
   He said the fastest growth is in suburban areas as urban density
continues to decline and automobile use increases. The Hudson
Institute is a Washington think tank that has studied several
national issues, including transportation needs.
   ``The country has become ever more tied to its personal,
on-demand, point-to-point transportation system: automobiles,''
Johnston said.
   ``Despite oil shortages and price increases, the lamentations of
many environmentalists and urban planners, and multi-billion dollar
federal investments in urban transit, nothing has dented the
dominance of the automobile,'' he said.
   General Motors President Robert C. Stempel said GM and other
companies are studying ``smart cars and smart highways'' that would
be computerized for increased safety and efficiency.
   In the meantime, he said, some simple things can be done to
improve road travel in many areas: traffic light coordination,
improved toll road payment procedures, and clearer and brighter
highway signs and markings.
   The Transportation Department is inviting citizens with ideas
about how to move Americans in the 21st Century _ and about how to
pay for the changes _ to attend the hearings around the country or
to send written proposals to the Transportation Department.
   The transportation secretary said he doesn't want the sessions
to turn into a littany of complaints.
   ``You shouldn't go if you're just going to say, `We've got
gridlock, somebody ought to do something about it,' because we know
that,'' Skinner said. ``These are needs and idea sessions.''
   The first meeting outside Washington will be held in Moscow,
Idaho, on Tuesday, with the focus on rural transportation issues.
The last meetings will be in Boston on Sept. 11-12 and will deal
with drug and alcohol use in the commercial transportation system
and federal research and development.

   A former federal housing official said Monday
that after joining a private law firm she was shown a HUD internal
document affecting one a client but she denied receiving special
treatment because of her friendship with a top aide to then-HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   Deborah Gore Dean asked someone ``to show it to me,'' Lynda
Murphy told a congressional subcommittee when asked how she was
able to read a sensitive Department of Housing and Urban
Development document before it was signed by Pierce.
   But when asked whether it would be fair to say her close
friendship with Ms. Dean helped her receive access to internal HUD
information, Ms. Murphy angrily replied: ``I don't think that's a
fair characterization.''
   A Republican member of the subcommittee, Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., criticized Ms. Murphy for hiring Ms. Dean as a consultant
not long after Ms. Dean left the housing agency.
   ``I'm beginning to feel there is a quid pro quo,'' Shays said.
Ms. Murphy said she did not believe there was anything improper
about hiring Ms. Dean. ``She was a good friend,'' she said later
when asked about their personal relationship.
   Ms. Murphy was one of two witnesses appearing before the House
Government Operations Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, which
is investigating allegations of fraud, abuse, mismanagement and
influence peddling at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   Influence was the central topic Monday, with panel members, Ms.
Murphy and a second witness, Republican National Committeeman
William Taylor, sparring in combative verbal exchanges often laced
with sarcasm and cynicism.
   Taylor, former chairman of the Florida Republican Party,
detailed at length his lobbying on behalf of the city of
Jacksonville and a variety of developers, and he defended his use
of national party stationery to write letters to HUD officials
seeking funding for his clients.
   ``I found nothing wrong with letting people know who I am,''
said Taylor. When Shays said the panel's goal was to rid Washington
of such influence peddling, Taylor retorted: ``Good luck'' and
added ``I didn't invent it.''
   ``I wish you were a Democrat,'' Republican Shays said. ``I am
embarrassed. ... You cashed in on your party.''
   Among those Taylor wrote to were Pierce and Ms. Dean, Pierce's
executive assistant who, according to testimony to Congress and
former HUD officials, was considered by many as ``de facto
secretary'' as far as many funding decisions were concerned in her
more than three years in the post.
   Notes from Ms. Dean that have been obtained by the subcommittee
show that a Georgia project for which Taylor had lobbied was on her
list for funding under the agency's Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation program.
   Also on Ms. Dean's approval list for the date April 7, 1987,
according to the notes released by the subcommittee, were 200 units
for ``Boston _ Ed Brooke.'' Brooke is a former Republican senator
who as an attorney has lobbied HUD on behalf of developers.
   Ms. Murphy is a Washington attorney who since leaving HUD in
1982 has had extensive dealings with the agency.
   She said that in the summer of 1985 while her law firm was
representing a client in HUD-related matters, she was shown a draft
of a letter Pierce was preparing to send to DRG Funding Corp., a
major lender in a HUD coinsurance program that had been placed on
probation because of numerous problems with its loan-approval
practices. Pierce criticized the firm for most of a nine-page
letter but in the next-to-last paragraph announced he was lifting
restrictions HUD had placed on the company.
   At the time, DRG was on HUD probation and had to have all its
loans approved in advance. Ms. Murphy's client was applying to DRG
for financing and its project was stalled because DRG had to get
HUD approval of the loan.
   Ms. Murphy said she made comments about the draft letter but
that it was not changed to reflect her position. And she disputed
contentions that she should not have been shown the document before
it was made public, saying there frequently was such ``give and
take about the language'' between HUD officials and representatives
of major firms doing business with the agency.
   Subcommittee member, however, did not accept her justification.
   ``I think you are being evasive,'' Shays said after Ms. Murphy
said she could not respond in detail to his question about Ms.
Dean's role in a later decision involving DRG, this one an
ultimately unsuccessful attempt to help a Houston development on
which HUD coinsured a mortgage that was issued at several times the
property's value.
   The exchanges with Taylor were at times humorous.
   When Taylor told Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., that he had great
respect for the congressman and his ``knack'' for crafting catchy
phrases, Frank responded: ``Why do I feel I should hold on to my
wallet at this moment, Mr. Taylor?''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will meet
with new President Wojciech Jaruzelski to discuss how the new
government should be formed, the state-run news agency said Monday.
   The meeting in Warsaw on Tuesday will be the first since the
army general and Communist Party first secretary was narrowly
elected president by the National Assembly on July 19.
   Jaruzelski began consultations with leaders of the nation's
political and social forces Monday, meeting the chairmen of two
parties allied with his own Communist Party, the PAP news agency
said.
   Jaruzelski is in the process of deciding who to nominate as
Poland's next prime minister and has urged Solidarity to join the
Communist Party in a coalition government.
   Solidarity lawmakers, who as the result of partly democratic
elections in June control the Senate and account for 35 percent of
the parliament's lower house, are deeply divided over whether to
enter into such a coalition.
   On Thursday, Solidarity lawmakers discussed whether to share the
Cabinet with party ministers or whether to demand all the Cabinet
seats including the prime minister's post but excluding control of
the army and police. They also considered whether to stay entirely
out of the government and function solely as a parliamentary
opposition.
   The debate was to resume this week.
   The Walesa-Jaruzelski meeting, confirmed by Walesa aide
Krzysztof Pusz in Gdansk, was expected to give both leaders a
chance to exchange views on how the next government should be
formed.
   On Monday, Jaruzelski met with chairmen of the Peasant's Party
and the Democratic Party, the two allied parties that form the
Communist coalition in the National Assembly, PAP said.
   The new president also will meet with chairmen of the official
OPZZ union, other government-sanctioned groups and the independent
farmers union, Rural Solidarity, the agency said.
   The state news agency announced that Communist Party deputies in
the lower house would confer Tuesday. Solidarity lawmakers will
hold their caucus Wednesday.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Tax Hike May Be Needed To Fight Drugs `Down the Road'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top anti-drug official, William
J. Bennett, said Monday that higher taxes may be needed ``down the
road'' to fight the war on drugs.
   ``I'll go on record: crack is worse than taxes,'' Bennett told
reporters after a closed meeting with representatives of the
nation's mayors, who want more federal anti-drug aid flowing to
cities.
   Bennett, after hearing the mayors' request, told reporters:
   ``I don't think we immediately have to say, `Well, we're going
to have to raise taxes.' Maybe down the road we will. But I think
there are other choices. It's facing priorities.''
   Bennett, the director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, also said that crack _ a potent, highly addictive form of
cocaine _ is ``a hell of a lot worse than pork, too.''
   Referring to unspecified ``pork barrel'' projects members of
Congress like to bring to their districts, he said, ``If we're
going to spend more money on the war on drugs, we have got to
decide where we're going to get the money to do it.''
   Earlier, Bennett heard the mayors push a 16-point plan they want
included in the national drug control strategy he is to produce by
Sept. 5.
   One point calls for increased aid for state and local anti-drug
programs ``with a significant portion of the funds going directly
to local governments,'' bypassing high-level bureaucracies.
   Houston Mayor Kathryn Whitmire, president of the U.S. Conference
of Mayors, commented after the meeting that ``most of us have had
to raise taxes in our local communities already to deal with the
drug problem, so we're not afraid to recommend that.''
   Whitmire said Bennett made no commitment to back a tax increase.
   New York City Mayor Ed Koch said, ``The people are ready to
accept an increase in taxes if they knew that the taxes were going
solely to interdict drugs and not for some social program which
they may or may not agree with.''
   The slogan ``crack is worse than taxes,'' Koch said, ``means
that people will pay to have this monster lifted from their
shoulders so their kids can be protected.''
   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn called for $3 billion in federal
funds to be distributed to states and cities to fight the drug war
and said, ``People will support tax dollars targeted to the war on
drugs.''
   Flynn said he asked Bennett whether he would support an
appropriation of $3 billion for the states and cities and was told,
``It depends on what Congress does.''
   Asked if Bush would support such a plan if Thomas S. Foley, the
speaker of the House, supports it, Flynn said:
   ``I didn't get an answer out of Mr. Bennett. He said maybe we
could rearrange money someway from here to there.
   ``That's not what we're talking about. We don't want to take
money from the homeless or infant mortality or from child care ...
or from affordable housing.''
   Bennett acknowledged that fighting the war on drugs ``is going
to cost more money ... and I think we should look to the federal
government for some of that money.''
   But he didn't say how much.
   ``Mayors always ask for more,'' he said. ``That's what mayors
do. I know that. They know that.''

   Showers and thunderstorms gathered Monday over parts of the
southeastern quarter of the nation and into the Midwest, with
locally heavy rain over parts of Florida.
   The wet weather clustered over the Texas coastal region,
Florida, Mississippi, western Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, and
southern and western Illinois.
   Heavier rain during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included 1.88
inches at Pensacola, Fla., and 1.51 inches at Key West, Fla.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms developed along a
cold front over eastern North Carolina and the middle Atlantic
Coast region.
   West of the major rain activity, widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms developed ahead of an upper-level weather disturbance
over eastern New Mexico and western Texas. A thunderstorm in
south-central Texas spawned several small, short-lived tornadoes
near Corpus Christi, the National Weather Service said.
   Waco, Texas, tied its record overnight low of 65 and Marquette,
Mich., tied its record high of 87.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 106 at Palm Springs, Calif. Monday
morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 39 at Yellowstone
National Park, Wyo.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the Atlantic Coast states to the Mississippi Valley, and
across the southern Plains, and the southern and central Rockies.
   High in the 60s and 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast;
in the lower 90s from Florida to the middle Atlantic Coast states
and southern and eastern sections of the Ohio Valley and over
Louisiana and southern Texas, and across most of the nation west of
the Rockies; and above 100 in the desert Southwest.

   The Justice Department, citing national
security concerns, won a delay Monday in the Iran-Contra criminal
case against the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica.
   A 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge in Richmond, Va.,
issued an emergency stay to temporarily block the trial of Joseph
Fernandez.
   The ex-CIA operative's trial was to have started Monday, but the
CIA wanted to stop Fernandez's lawyers from identifying as part of
his defense three CIA programs in Costa Rica and locations of three
CIA stations and facilities in Latin America.
   The Justice Department sought the emergency stay after U.S.
District Court Judge Claude Hilton rejected prosecutors' proposals
to substitute numbers for the three CIA locations and to drop
portions of one criminal charge against Fernandez to avoid
mentioning the CIA programs.
   Hilton said Fernandez must be allowed to mention the names of
the CIA programs and that substituting numbers for names of the
three CIA locations was not acceptable.
   Ron Noble, a deputy assistant attorney general, told the judge
the department would seek a delay of the trial.
   With a pool of prospective jurors waiting in a room adjacent to
the court, the judge, obviously irritated, asked Noble why the
Justice Department didn't take action a week ago.
   ``This is a very difficult thing for the department to do,''
replied Noble. He said the proposals from the prosecutors ``would
allow this trial to go forward. We have no alternative.''
   At the appeals court, the Justice Department is seeking to
formally intervene in the case and wants the court to reconsider
Hilton's denial of the prosecutors' proposals.
   Fernandez is charged with lying about his involvement with
Oliver North's Contra resupply network. He faces two counts of
obstruction and two counts of making false statements in his
responses to the CIA inspector general's office and the Tower
Commission in 1987.
   The Justice Department went to the appeals court instead of
taking an unprecedented step of filing a national security
affidavit with the court. Such a document would categorically bar
disclosure of certain classified information and could kill the
case.
   Fernandez's lawyer, Thomas Wilson, called the Justice
Department's trip to the appeals court unconscionable.
   ``We don't even know what case we're trying,'' complained
Wilson. He said the government has known since charges were first
brought against Fernandez last year that his defense would involve
significant disclosures of classified information.
   Saying that ``enough is enough,'' Wilson called on the Justice
Department to file a national security affidavit.
   In a letter to the Justice Department that was filed in court
Monday, Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh said that the CIA was
trying to ``protect a fictional secret`' by objecting to the
release of certain classified documents. The Fernandez case, he
said, would be untriable if the department blocks disclosure of the
names of CIA stations as well as of the three CIA Costa Rican
programs.
   Walsh added that if the CIA action to protect documents prevents
the trial from going forward, ``I believe that there must be a
broad re-evaluation of the standards'' under which such power is
exercised.
   With a Justice Department affidavit in hand, Hilton would have
no choice under federal law but to prohibit the ex-CIA operative
from using in his defense the classified information detailed in
the affidavit.
   That could lead to the judge dismissing some or all the criminal
charges, on grounds that the prohibited information was vital to
giving him a fair trial.

   Members of Congress preferred to earn their
speaking fees in sunny climates last year, when 60 lawmakers
traveled to the Caribbean, Florida, California and Hawaii, Common
Cause said Monday.
   The congressional watchdog group also discovered that several
House members received honoraria from their constituents, some
racked up piles of money quickly in what the group called an
``honoraria blitz'' and others earned outside income from private
businesses.
   Members of Congress reported earning more than $9 million in
honoraria last year, usually from special interest groups trying to
influence legislation.
   House and Senate rules allow a member to keep only $2,000 per
appearance. The Senate allows its rank-and-file members to keep
$35,800 in outside income and the House permits retention of
$26,850. Amounts over those figures go to charity.

<HEAD>Art Dealer Says Hotels Paid for Jade Art Objects for Mansion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry and Leona Helmsley billed their hotels a
half-million dollars for antique jade figures for their Connecticut
mansion in February 1984, an art dealer testified Monday.
   Mrs. Helmsley returned one of the art objects a year and a half
later and personally cashed a $71,000 refund, witness Sydney
Sahkenazie testified at Mrs. Helmsley's federal tax-evasion trial.
   Ashkenazie said he went along with a scheme to bill the hotels
for the jade by submitting fake invoices for furniture purchases
because the Helmsleys were weeks late in payment and he was having
cash flow problems.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita admitted into evidence
invoices that gave detailed descriptions of antique furniture that
didn't change hands.
   In other testimony, the executive vice president of Helmsley
Hotels, Geoffrey Lerigo, said the Park Lane Hotel paid a $10,685
bill for uniforms for the servants at the Greenwich, Conn.,
mansion, Dunnellen Hall.
   The uniforms included suits, clip ties, black trousers and
swallowtail jackets for the butlers; four kinds of aprons, pink
checked and black cotton dresses and matching headpieces for the
maids; and cotton jackets and trousers for the cook.
   Lerigo and Ashkenazie, whose business Ashkenazie &amp; Co. is
located in San Francisco, testified with immunity in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan. Mrs. Helmsley and two former aides, Frank Turco
and Joseph Licari, are charged with tax evasion. Helmsley's case
was severed from his wife's because a series of strokes affected
his memory and he was declared icompetent to stand trial.
   Mrs. Helmsley is accused of evading taxes by disguising $4
million in renovations at Dunnellen Hall and other personal items
as business expenses.
   Ashkenazie said the Helmsleys, who head a $5 billion hotel and
real estate empire, agreed to buy a $210,000 jade water buffalo, a
$150,000 jade mountain, a $80,000 jade incense burner and a $60,000
pair of lavender jade buffalo.
   Five weeks later, after he pressed for payment, Licari
telephoned and told him to send new invoices that indicated the
Helmsleys had bought furniture, Ashkenazie testified.
   ``I don't see how I can do that. We don't deal in furniture,''
Ashkenazie said he told Licari.
   Licari then told him to send blank invoices that he would fill
out in New York and Ashkenazie could keep his own records, he said.
   A year and a half later, Mrs. Helmsley called him and said she
was unhappy with the jade mountain and asked for a refund.
   The Helmsleys decided to take two additional jade objects in
exchange, leaving a $71,000 balance, Ashkenazie testified. He said
he sent the amount in two checks made out to Mrs. Helmsley, who
endorsed and cashed each check.

<HEAD>Foley Speaks Against Lightly Amending the Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley spoke Monday
against lightly and frivolously amending the Constitution to ban
flag burning.
   ``I cannot imagine why anyone in this country, the president or
anybody else, should favor amending the Constitution unnecessarily
without reason if a statute can accomplish all the objectives that
the president or others seek,'' the Washington Democrat said in his
first appearance as House speaker before the National Press Club.
   Foley and other Democratic leaders contend it is possible to
draft a statute banning flag burning that will meet the standards
of the Supreme Court, which ruled last month in a Texas case that
flag burning was a protected form of free expression.
   President Bush and House and Senate Republican leaders are
backing a constitutional amendment, arguing that a statute can't
work.
   The issue has raised political tensions in Congress, with
Democratic lawmakers opposed to the amendment worried that the GOP
campaign organization will flog them as less patriotic unless they
vote for it.
   ``I think to lightly, frivolously almost, rush forward and amend
the Constitution out of political or partisan or legalistic reasons
when there is an opportunity to consider a statute ... achieving
the objectives is something that we should all be concerned
about,'' Foley said.
   ``The Congress would be wise to draft a statute and see what the
courts do with it,'' he said.
   Congress can include with the statute a provision that would
speed court review, he said.
   The House Judiciary Committee is expected to meet on flag
legislation later this week and Foley said he still intends to
bring a statute to the full House before the August recess.
   Foley said he might not be able to block a House vote on the
constitutional amemdment, but indicated he'd at least like to let
the Senate act first, which it is now scheduled to do in October.
   ``The danger is not only amending the Constitution without
necessity, it's lowering the level of resistance in the Congress
and the country to amendments to the Constitution and most
particularly to the First Amendment, which is the basis as we all
know of speech, religious and press liberty,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panel Says Lyme Disease Is Spreading Quickly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness that is
difficult to diagnose, has been reported in 43 states and will soon
reach five more, a panel predicted Monday.
   ``Lyme disease is one of the most rapidly growing diseases in
the United States'' that are spread by carriers other than humans,
said Dr. Steven Hausman, who is with the National Institute of
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.
   Hausman spoke at a news conference, along with two members of
Congress and a Connecticut family struck by the illness, to mark
Lyme Disease Awareness Week, which began Monday.
   Lyme disease, which is caused by a bacterium, is spread by the
common deer tick. Symptoms usually start with a circular rash, and
include fever, chills, fatigue, aching and stiffness. Paralysis may
follow.
   While most of the known cases have been concentrated in the
Northeast _ particularly Connecticut and Suffolk and Westchester
counties in New York _ Lyme disease was reported last year in every
continental state except Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Arizona and
New Mexico.
   ``We won't stop the ticks _ they're in 43 states already and
soon they'll be in 50,'' said Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y.
   There were nearly 14,000 reported cases in 1988, but ``we fear
this is a very low number,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
   In 1987, there were only 5,800 reported cases, but much of the
jump was due to better reporting, said Dr. Stephen Heyes, director
of the office of disease prevention at the National Institutes of
Health.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Lawmakers to Back His Spending Plans for B-2 and Star
Wars</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS graf 9: ``While House,'' to UPDATE with Senate approval
of tactical missile amendment; edits to tighten.</HEAD>

   President Bush appealed to Congress Monday to
accept his call for billions of dollars for the B-2 bomber and Star
Wars as lawmakers squared off in initial skirmishing on a defense
blueprint for the year.
   Speaker Thomas Foley predicted the House would pare Bush's call
for $4.7 billion for the so-called stealth bomber for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1. He said the plane ``will survive in some
form of limited procurement.''
   Bush summoned lawmakers to the White House and Foley offered his
prediction as both houses began work on differing versions of
defense legislation. Debate was expected to consume several days in
both houses.
   Facing growing opposition to the stealth bomber, Bush personally
lobbied members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and other
leading senators, urging support for the ``revolutionary plane with
revolutionary technology.''
   ``We need the utmost flexibility in terms of arms control,'' the
president said, dismissing complaints about the bomber's high price
tag _ $70 billion for 132 planes, or $530 million a copy.
   On Capitol Hill, Vice President Dan Quayle conceded that the
Pentagon should have released the cost estimates on the bomber
earlier than it did. The bomber program, shrouded in secrecy for 10
years, has become more public with the release of figures last
month and the aircraft's first flight last week.
   ``Those numbers should have been revealed publicly a lot sooner
than they were,'' Quayle told reporters during a meeting in his
congressional office. ``It would have made (the political battle) a
lot less complicated and much easier.''
   The vice president, who plans to spend Tuesday lobbying for
Bush's version of the defense budget, indicated that the
administration faces a tougher fight in the House than in the
Senate.
   While House members clashed in general debate over the B-2 and
Star Wars, the Senate approved by a vote of 91-to-0 an amendment to
add $596.8 million in fiscal 1990 and $336.8 million in fiscal 1991
for tactical missiles, which includes the Stinger and TOW.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the Senate could expect a difficult conference
fight with the House over the defense budget.
   At the start of Senate debate, Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., a member
of the Armed Services Committee, proclaimed that the ``unchecked
defense budget is history.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a member of the armed services
panel, said that although Bush's budget is ``not ideal, it
represents the best compromise given the budget problems in our
nation.''
   House debate got off to a rocky start as Republicans criticized
a decision by the Democratic-controlled Rules Committee to vote on
the fate of the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D Tomcat in a single
amendment.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in crafting a $295 billion
defense budget, has proposed eliminating the Marine Corps V-22, a
tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can fly
like a plane, and the F-14D jet fighter.
   After a few hours of behind-the-scenes wrangling, Rep. David
Bonior, D-Mich., a member of the Rules Committee, offered a
provision to allow the House to vote on separate amendments to
eliminate money for the V-22 and F-14D. The procedural rule then
was approved by voice vote.
   Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the
House Armed Services Committee, plans to introduce an amendment to
accept Cheney's budget. Dickinson also had sought separate
amendments on whether to fund the V-22 and F-14D.
   But the Rules Committee had decided to combine the two in a
single amendment and the panel's minority members approved the
decision.
   The House plan was to complete the defense bill by the end of
the week. The House planned to take up Star Wars on Tuesday, the
stealth bomber and ICBMs on Wednesday and other aspects of the
defense bill on Thursday.
   The stealth bomber remained the most controversial and uncertain
issue in the bill.
   Reps. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, and Mike Synar, D-Okla., will introduce an amendment to
freeze funds for the bomber until Congress receives more
information. The bill also would include money for production of
only two bombers in 1990 and 1991, when the administration wants
eight bombers.
   Another amendment by Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., John Kasich,
R-Ohio, and John Rowland, R-Conn., proposes stopping production
after the 13 planes now in construction and mothballing the line.
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., will propose accepting the decision of
the House Armed Services Committee, which cut $800 million from the
$4.7 billion the Pentagon requested for the B-2 in the fiscal 1990
budget.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri told
reporters Monday that he didn't ``sense a Republican or Democratic
position on the B-2.''
   On Star Wars, the House Armed Services Committee slashed $1.1
billion from the Bush administration's request of $4.9 billion for
what is formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   A series of House amendments would eliminate all funds for the
program, cut it to $1.3 billion, reduce it to $3.1 billion or
increase it to $4.1 billion.
   Bush told lawmakers Monday: ``I strongly support what we sent up
there to the Hill. SDI, in my view, is critical.''

<TEXT>
   The heir to Yugoslavia's abolished
throne has called for the restoration of the monarchy as a way to
overcome the economic and political problems in this
Communist-ruled country.
   ``I hope that my country will reform politically so that the
ruling party competes in elections with the full freedom of the
people to decide,'' said Crown Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevic in
an interview published in the current issue of Start magazine in
Zagreb.
   ``If I ever go to Yugoslavia it will be to live there and to
contribute to its development,'' said Aleksandar who has never been
in Yugoslavia. The interview was held in London where Aleksandar
lives.
   His father, King Peter II, fled Yugoslavia in 1941 during the
Nazi invasion and spent the war years in England where Aleksandar
was born in 1945.
   The king and other members of the royal family were barred from
returning when the monarchy was abolished and a single-party
republic proclaimed in 1945.
   Aleksandar served as an officer in the British army and is now a
succesful businessman.
   Yugoslavia is struggling with soaring inflation, unemployment,
ethnic strife between its various nationalities and divisions
within the Communist Party leadership.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes Grants Ban on Two Arts Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts would be
forbidden to award tax-paid grants to sponsors of two controversial
photographic exhibitions for the next five years under legislation
approved Monday by a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.
   The panel also endorsed a House-approved proposal to trim the
endowment's proposed $171.4 million budget next year by $45,000 _
the exact amount the agency gave for the two controversial shows by
photographers Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.
   In addition, the Senate subcommittee voted $100,000 to hire an
outside consultant to review the arts endowment's grant-making
procedures, which have come under fire recently from several
conservative members of Congress.
   The Senate panel's action drew a fast protest from Hugh
Southern, acting chairman of the endowment, an independent federal
agency that currently awards $169 million annually to a wide
variety of artists and arts institutions, from theaters and
symphony orchestras to painters and poets.
   ``Enactment of this provision would be the first instance since
the endowment's founding nearly 25 years ago of direct
congressional involvement in awarding or prohibiting specific
grants,'' Southern said.
   ``Banning funding for specific institutions establishes a
dangerous precedent which goes against the long and widely
respected system of federal support for the arts through a
competitive peer review process,'' he said.
   The bill would impose a five-year ban on NEA grants to the
Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania,
which organized the Mapplethorpe exhibition, and the Southeastern
Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., which awarded
NEA funds to Serrano.
   The NEA had given $30,000 to underwrite a national tour of the
Mapplethorpe show, which included homoerotic and sadomasochistic
pictures and several photos of nude children. The Corcoran Gallery
of Art in Washington canceled plans to display the Mapplethorpe
photos to avoid becoming involved in a political battle over
congressional financing of the endowment.
   Serrano received a $15,000 NEA grant through the Southeastern
Center for his work, which included a widely criticized photograph
of a Christ figure submerged in a container of the artist's urine.
   The House, in its action on the arts endowment's budget on July
12, did not propose banning grants to the two photographers'
sponsors, but did include language intended to make the endowment
more accountable for grant funds that are dispensed by a local
institution.
   The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, a Methodist minister from Tupelo,
Miss., urged Congress to eliminate all funds for the arts endowment
to halt what he called government subsidies for ``pornography and
anti-Christian bigotry.''
   Wildmon, executive director of the non-profit American Family
Association, held a news conference Monday outside the endowment's
headquarters here to protest the NEA's indirect support for
Mapplethorpe and Serrano.
   Wildmon called their photographs ``extremely offensive,
demeaning and pornographic.''

<HEAD>Contras Reluctant To Demobilize Until There's Democracy In Nicaragua</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of Nicaragua's Contra
rebels said Monday they were meeting with Central American
presidents to explain their reluctance to disband before before
Nicaragua achieves democracy.
   Nicaragua's embassy in San Salvador issued a statement Monday
rejecting allegations that its diplomats helped leftist Salvadoran
guerrillas and were guilty of subversion.
   The seven members of the political and military commission of
the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras call their organization,
told a news conference they met earlier Monday with President
Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador.
   They conferred Saturday with President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica
and planned meetings Tuesday with presidents Vinicio Cerezo of
Guatemala and Jose Azcona of Honduras.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and the four other Central
American leaders are to meet Aug. 5-7 in Tela, Honduras, about
implementing a Central American peace plan that includes disbanding
the U.S.-supported rebels.
   Contra leaders said they want demobilization delayed until
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government guarantees national
elections scheduled for Feb. 25 will be honest and fair.
   ``Our army must remain intact to act as guarantors of any
accord'' to make Nicaragua democratic, said Israel Galeano, one of
the Contra leaders.
   Galeano said his commission believed Arias and Cristiani would
present the Contra point of view, ``at least partially,'' at the
Honduran summit.
   Washington ended military aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels in
February 1988, but the Contras continue to receive nonlethal
assistance.
   The Nicaraguan Embassy statement responded to accusations Friday
by a woman student, arrested on charges of taking part in rebel
activities, who claimed an embassy officer provided Salvadoran
guerrillas with money and training.
   It described the allegations as part of a campaign to undermine
the Central American summit.
   Zoila Marroquin, a student at the National University who said
she had been a member of the Farabundo National Liberation Front
guerrilla organization since 1986, spoke to reporters at Treasury
Police headquarters. She is being held for sedition.
   Ms. Marroquin said Nicaraguan consul Alberto Leal channeled
money from Nicaragua and its Soviet bloc allies to guerrilla fronts
at the university and gave students grants for political and
military training in Nicaragua.
   The embassy denied any staff members had met with Ms. Marroquin,
and declared: ``Her statements lack any element of truth because
they refer to events that did not occur.''
   Cristiani has said he will present evidence at the summit that
Nicaragua has supplied weapons to the Salvadoran rebels.
   Human rights groups estimate more than 70,000 people have been
killed since guerrillas began fighting in El Salvador in October
1979.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of residents fled from
artillery duels in Beirut Monday, some taking their dead with them
amid reports that 14 years of civil war have filled Beirut's
cemeteries to capacity.
   The ghost-town atmosphere also spawned the first major bank
robbery in two years.
   ``I have never seen Beirut in such sadness,'' said one resident.
``It is as if the whole of Lebanon is preparing for a funeral.''
   Syrian gunners killed an elderly Greek Orthodox priest and
wounded three other civilians in a bombardment of Christian east
Beirut and the shore north of the capital, said a police spokesman.
   Christian artillery blasted Syrian batteries along west Beirut's
seafront, but all shells landed offshore and there were no
casualties, said the spokesman.
   He also said six people drowned this weekend trying to get water
from wells in Moslem districts of Beirut, which has been without
water for a week.
   The latest casualties raised the toll to 453 dead and 1,859
injured since the confrontation erupted March 8 between Lebanese
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mostly Christian troops and
Moslem Syrian army soldiers.
   The shelling went on sporadically through the night but was less
intense than the weekend bombardment, which underscored Aoun's
attempt to break Syria's naval and land blockades imposed March 14
against the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. Aoun has blockaded
illegal ports operated by Moslem militias.
   Police said 700,000 of the city's 1.5 million residents have
fled since March, with a quarter-million streaming out in recent
days.
   In west Beirut's Mar Elias district, masked gunmen stormed into
the Bank of Beirut for Commerce, locked employees and clients in
one room and escaped with an estimated $40,000, said the police
spokesman.
   Bank robberies proliferated during the lawless period between
1984 and 1987 when feuding Moslem militias fought for control of
west Beirut. Robberies declined after Syria sent troops to restore
order. Syria keeps 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
   Lately, caskets have been piling up around the city's
cemeteries, and ambulances and hearses were seen leaving Beirut on
Monday taking the dead to other parts of Lebanon for burial.
   ``Cemeteries in Beirut, the city of death, have no room left for
new graves,'' East Beirut's conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said
Monday.
   It quoted an unidentified cemetery caretaker as saying:``Graves
are full. The new fatalities will have to remain out in the open
because there is no burial space left.''
   More than 150,000 people have been killed since the civil war
broke out in 1975, mostly in and around Beirut.
   ``We're packed to the brim,'' said a Greek Orthodox priest at
west Beirut's Saint Mary's church, whose courtyard houses the
biggest Christian cemetery in the Moslem sector. ``We have to work
out a system to cope, but I don't know how.''
   Beirut's vast public beaches were deserted Monday and the only
people on the streets searched for water.
   ``Water vendors are making a killing,'' according to Zuheir
Mullah, a janitor who said he had just invested his savings of $750
buying 200 gallons of water, half of which he plans to sell.
Vendors are selling water for about $10 a gallon.
   In Iran, Lebanon's rival Shiite Moslem factions pledged in a
joint communique issued in Tehran to end their 15-month-old feud,
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   An estimated 560 people have been killed in fighting between the
Syrian-backed Amal militia and pro-Iranian Hezbollah that erupted
in early July following a five-month lull.
   The communique was published Monday, one day after leaders of
both Shiite factions ended a two-week visit to Iran, according to
the IRNA report monitored in Cyprus.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting to dominate Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites.

   Arctic Eskimos from Alaska in the
west to Siberia in the east met in Greenland on Monday to discuss
common cultural and ecological problems.
   It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a general
assembly of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, a non-governmental
umbrella organization for Inuit, or Eskimos, from Alaska, Canada,
Greenland and Soviet Union.
   About 450 Inuit were expected take part in the west Greenland
township of Sisimuit.
   A 10-man delegation, which is attending as an observer, says it
represents native Siberians known as Yuit.
   ``Even though President Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika has
reached areas of the Soviet Union where the 1,600 Yuit live, there
are many problems we would like to discuss with the ICC,''
delegation leader Nadesjda Utke said during a stopover in
Copenhagen.
   ``We want to exchange experiences in maintaining traditional
hunting and implements, educational materials and greater
participation by the local people in decision-making,'' she said.
   The fifth general assembly was being held under the motto ``A
Celebration of Inuit Unity,'' to mark the first Soviet
participation. It was opened by the current Conference President,
Mary Simon of Canada.
   Topics for discussion during the five-day gathering included
environment and renewable resources, promotion of Inuit rights
internationally and transboundry pollution of the Arctic.
   A series of workshops were set up to study and report back on
such specialized topics as Arctic peace and security, whaling, the
``anti-harvesting'' conservation movement's impact on traditional
hunting, Inuit culture, land use and costal zone management.
   About 40,000 Inuit live in Greenland, 28,000 in Alaska and
11,000 in Canada. The Soviet Inuits comprise a small part of the
150,000 natives of the Siberian north.
   Greenland, the world's biggest island and a former colony of
Denmark, this summer celebrates its tenth year with homerule-style
local government.

<TEXT>
   Frelimo, Mozambique's ruling party,
opened its national congress Monday with strong hints of moving
away from Marxist ideology toward a market-oriented economy.
   The eight-day party congress also is expected to debate a plan
by President Joaquim Chissano calling for negotiation between the
government and rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance,
commonly called Renamo.
   Frelimo, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, has ruled
the nation in southeastern Africa since independence from Portugal
in 1975. The rebel war, combined with mismanagement and a weak
infrastructure left by the Portuguese, has made Mozambique one of
the world's poorest countries.
   In his opening address, Chissano appeared to hint at better
relations with businessmen and others who have had little influence
in the past.
   ``Since our essential task is to combat the destabilization of
which the country is a target, all Mozambican classes and social
strata are equally involved in the project'' of rebuilding the
country, he declared.
   Among changes to be considered are admission of property owners,
businessmen, shop owners and the religious faithful to Frelimo
membership.
   Chissano said, however, that religious believers would have to
``accept that the implementation of the party program is no less
important'' than their beliefs. The country has a mixture of
Christians, Moslems and animists.
   Another proposed change would lift restrictions on the number of
workers who can be employed by farmers belonging to Frelimo, which
the official news agency AIM said ``is justified by the need to
increase food production and for party members to lead this drive.''
   It added, however, that a party Central Committee report to be
discussed at the congress ``makes clear its preference for party
members to work in cooperatives.''
   Vigorous debate is expected on economic policy and government
efforts to end the war, which has cost hundreds of thousands of
lives and half the country's 14.7 million people wholly or partly
dependent on food aid.
   The government has been moving to end central control of the
economy since 1983. It has met conditions set by the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank and has experienced modest growth
in recent years after a decade of decline.

<HEAD>Ship Bottom Buckling Concerns Raised Over Impact On Salvageability</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Exxon Pullout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Underwater sections of the hull of the tanker
Exxon Valdez, ripped open on a reef that caused the nation's worst
oil spill, have increasingly buckled and loosened, officials said
Monday.
   ``I want to stress and emphasize we are not yet in a critical
situation,'' Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg said. ``We're still
optimistic the ship will be able to come in (for repairs).''
   Solberg said the ship remains seaworthy, but its fate
increasingly is at the mercy of weather and ocean conditions as it
waits off San Diego to be declared free of environmental and
navigational hazards.
   The Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude into
Alaska's wildlife-rich Prince William Sound on March 24 after it
went off course and rammed its hull across Bligh Reef.
   Preliminary repairs were made before the ship was towed 2,500
miles to San Diego for repairs in drydock, but during the voyage
huge sections of underwater hull plating pulled away and dangled
beneath the hull.
   Working four to six miles off San Clemente Island, divers
through Monday had cut away five of seven jagged steel plates. They
began the interim repairs Friday and expect to take three to four
more days to finish.
   The dangling plates must be removed so the Valdez can navigate
San Diego Harbor shallows en route to the National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co. yard for a nine-month, $25 million repair job.
   Signs of further hull buckling have been spotted, however.
   ``As these plates loosen, and there are signs more are
loosening, it eventually could reach a point where the
salvageability of the vessel could be in doubt,'' Solberg said.
``The reason being, it might not have enough bottom for adequate
support while the ship is in dry dock.''
   Exxon Shipping Co. spokeswoman Jan Cool said the company was
confident the ship will make it to the NASSCO shipyard.
   ``We feel pretty confident that we're going to arrest any
further deterioration of the hull by cutting the plates which are
hanging down ... and cutting small pieces of plate before they pull
away any further,'' Cool said.
   Cool acknowledged a worsening of ocean conditions could
exacerbate the buckling of the ship's hull.
   ``Obviously, at some point, I don't know where that point is,
the ship would have difficulty in dry docking because you need a
bottom to support her,'' said Fred Hallet, NASSCO's vice president
of finance and public relations.
   Cool said no one has calculated just how much of the damaged
hull needs to be removed.

   State environmental officials said Monday
they are unhappy with Exxon's plan to withdraw its oil spill
cleanup forces from Prince William Sound by mid-September, but the
company says the pullout is not negotiable.
   ``We've been saying all along we would operate until about Sept.
15 when we have to shut down because of the weather,'' said Exxon
spokesman Henry Beathard. ``None of that has changed.
   ``Generally Sept. 15 is an average date. Sometimes bad weather
starts before that; sometimes after that.''
   A July 19 memo from Otto Harrison, Exxon's general manager in
Valdez, to company officials indicates Exxon is adamant about a
mid-September pullout.
   He said Exxon will conduct no winter cleanup operations because
of safety and operational reasons and the company's only commitment
for next spring is to survey the shorelines.
   ``These are not negotiable points,'' he wrote in the memo, a
copy of which was provided to The Associated Press.
   The memo was dated the day before Exxon President Bill Stevens'
testimony to the National Ocean Policy Study Subcommittee of the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportion Committee. He reluctantly
committed the company to resuming operations next year if more work
needs to be done.
   But Steve Provant, on-scene oil spill coordinator for the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation, said his agency wants
Exxon to leave a contingency force behind to deal with oil that may
wash off beaches and cause problems during the winter.
   ``We're not asking them to do any beach cleaning or anything
like that in the winter,'' he said.
   An army of 11,000 people, 1,000 vessels and more than 70
aircraft has been trying to clean beaches stained by the nation's
largest oil spill. The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24,
spilling about 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sound's
pristine waters.
   ``You can't work up to the last day and pull them all out,''
Beathard said. ``We're working on a plan that gets them out by
Sept. 15. That's the average date of when the winter storms set in
and you can no longer operate out there.''
   He said studies to determine the exact day the last Exxon
workers would be withdrawn should be completed in about two weeks.
   Exxon on Monday announced that the cleanup costs stemming from
the spill had reduced its second-quarter profit by $850 million.
   Provant said his agency believes the Sept. 15 date is
``arbitrary,'' and that it might be possible to have some crews
continue working in the sound until Oct. 1.
   ``We would like to see that they still maintain come capability
to continue working as long as the weather is nice. Plans to have
everything out of here by Sept. 15 just seems too rigid to us,''
Provant said. ``The DEC plans winter activities such as
overflights, mapping, beach monitoring and collection of water
quality data.
   But Beathard said that was out of the question. ``We have no
intention of doing that. We think it's a safety factor. We've never
talked about operating in the winter on the cleanup,'' he said.
   The memo also said Exxon's ``discussions with federal or state
agencies is for the purpose of keeping them informed, and is not
requesting approval. In discussions on these matters you should
stress the safety and operational factors. We are willing to
discuss these factors. We are not willing to discuss the
decisions.''
   Beathard said a shoreline assessment would be undertaken in the
spring.
   ``We're saying we do not think that any cleanup operations will
be needed because we plan to work on all the shorelines before we
pull out,'' he said. ``There will be some oil that remains on some
shorelines or down in the gravel.
   ``But we believe six months of winter storms and tidal action
will remove most, if not all, of what's remaining,'' Beathard said.
``If there is remaining oil next spring it will be asphaltic in
nature and it would be more environmentally damaging to remove it
than to leave it there. It poses no environmental threat.''

<HEAD>Expert: Literature Tests So Poorly Written They Encourage Shortcuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standardized literature tests are so poorly
written they encourage students to read condensed versions of
classics, a study released Monday concluded.
   Multiple-choice exams are more apt to test students on memorized
facts than on ideas, said the study by researchers at the State
University of New York at Albany.
   ``The reading of a poem is treated like reading an encyclopedia.
What are the facts? It's the Joe Friday approach to education,''
said Alan Purves, co-director of the university's Center for the
Learning and Teaching of Literature.
   Purves recommended that standardized tests, like the Scholastic
Aptitude Test for college-bound students, also use essay questions
to make students think about what they've read. He said students
can easily get by reading commercial plot summaries.
   Multiple choice tests satisfy school districts' needs for
accountability without truly measuring competence, Purves said.
   ``They aren't particularly interested in how good the
measurements of accountability are, just so they can have a number
they can throw in front of their school board,'' he said.
   Educational Testing Service, which produces the Scholastic
Aptitude Test, has written multiple-choice test questions that
measure analysis and interpretive abilities, spokeswoman Janet
Waanders said.
   ``It is true that there can be good multiple-choice questions
about interpretation,'' Purves said. ``What we found was that there
were very few of them on these tests.''

<HEAD>Panic at Banks as Currency Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police were stationed to guard post
offices and banks Monday as Zambians clamored to exchange the old
paper money for new currency, Finance Ministry officials reported.
   The old currency must be traded for the new by Aug. 3. It will
be without value after that deadline.
   Monday was the first day of business since the government
announced Saturday the currency would be replaced in a move to curb
forgery, smuggling and black marketeering.
   The oficials reported ``scenes of panic'' at banks and business
centers in Lusaka and elsewhere in the country, but there were no
reports of violence.
   A police spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said money
traders from neighboring Zaire attempted to pass through at least
three border posts in northwestern Zambia early Monday. He said
they were repelled by armed frontier guards but gave no further
details.
   In Lusaka about 75 percent of the capital's shops and exchange
centers remained closed despite government appeals that they accept
the old bank notes until the Aug. 3 deadline.
   It is believed that Zaireans possess millions of kwacha, the
Zambian currency, with much of the money gained from illicit
trading along the border.
   In the northwestern town of Solwezi, provincial official
Alexander Kamalondo urged Zambians not to help Zaireans cross the
border to change currency.
   Zambia, in the announcement Saturday on the currency change,
also ordered the closing of all land-border crossings until Aug. 3.
   The Finance Ministry announcement said the government was
replacing the 1.6 billion Kwacha ($100 million) in circulation.
   The currency change is one of the economic reforms ordered by
President Kenneth Kaunda.
   Under the measure Zambians will be able to exchange up to 2,000
Kwacha ($125) without providing proof of the source of the money.
Amounts over 10,000 Kwacha ($625) will be subject to a 50 percent
tax.
   The government has said it believes millions of the old currency
bills have been accumulated by individuals through tax evasion,
illegal money deals and smuggling, especially between Zambia and
Zaire.

<HEAD>Senior Scientists Hard to Recruit, Says NIH Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low salaries and tempting offers from the
private sector are making it increasingly difficult for the
government to recruit and retain senior scientists, the director of
the National Institutes of Health said Monday.
   Dr. James Wyngaarden told the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee that the intellectual stimulation, prestige and research
freedom offered by the government institutes is not enough to
attract and keep top scientists.
   A change, the NIH director said, ``is essential to restoring NIH
to a fully competitive posture and demonstrating the commitment of
the federal government to maintaining a first-class biomedical
research program.''
   Of the 176 NIH staff who are members of the Senior Executive
Service, 53 are physicians and 104 have doctorate degrees, he said.
   Senior Executive Service physicians are paid about half as much
as their counterparts at university research centers, and those
with doctoral degrees are paid 19 percent less than those in
comparable academic positions, he said.
   Additionally, the gap between NIH physician salaries and the pay
they would receive at a U.S. medical school has widened to about
$99,000, he said.
   ``Many of our senior scientists are considering whether to
remain with NIH because of these salary considerations,'' said
Wyngaarden, who was appointed by then-President Reagan in 1982 and
is leaving NIH at the end of the month. A replacement hasn't been
nominated by President Bush.
   Wyngaarden said he is encouraged by President Bush's recent
proposal to raise salaries for employees in senior positions
requiring specialized and critical skills. Under his plan, pay for
senior government workers generally would go up by as much as 25
percent.
   At NIH, top pay for a senior doctoral scientist is $76,400
before bonuses. The ceiling for a senior physician is $96,400.
Bonuses can boost that to a maximum of $99,000, said NIH spokesman
Storm Whaley.
   According to a recent NIH survey to which a quarter of its Ph.D.
scientists and science managers responded, 83 percent reported
receiving one or more employment offers ranging from $100,000 to
$500,000, Wyngaarden said. The average offer was $166,000, he said.
   ``With offers of this magnitude, NIH can expect to lose a
substantial number of key senior research scientists and science
managers,'' he said.
   Low pay has also hampered recruiting efforts, he said.
   ``Since 1980, NIH has not been able to recruit a single research
scientist into the Senior Executive Service from the private or
academic sectors to engage in the independent conduct of a clinical
or basic biomedical research program,'' the director said.

<HEAD>Poll: Most Teens Take Up the Habit Because of Friends, Social Pressure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most teen-agers who smoke do so because their
friends light up or because they feel peer pressure, a survey
conducted by teen-agers indicates.
   The poll, commissioned by a trade association of vending-machine
operators, also indicates that teen-agers mostly buy cigarettes
over the counter, not from machines.
   The poll results were released Monday, a day before the chief
counsel for the Chicago-based National Automatic Merchandising
Association was to testify before a congressional hearing on
regulating tobacco sales through vending machines.
   ``We in the vending industry have long been aware that our
machines are not a significant source of cigarettes for minors
because the majority is located in bars, cocktail lounges and
places of employment were teen-agers are not present,'' said the
attorney, Richard W. Funk.
   The survey involved interviews of 1,015 people ages 13 to 17.
The interviews were conducted at 40 shopping malls in 20 major
cities.
   The study found that 42 percent of the teen-agers questioned
started smoking because their friends used tobacco. Thirty percent
said peer pressure was the cause.
   Association spokesman Walter W. Reed said he could not
distinguish between those responses, but said they are based on the
respondents' words.
   An additional 15 percent of those surveyed cited smoking by
parents or other relatives as the reason they started using tobacco.
   On the vending-machine issue, 78 percent of the teen-agers who
``often or occasionally'' buy cigarettes said they ``seldom or
never'' used vending machines.
   Among teen-agers who buy over the counter, 43 percent said they
get cigarettes at convenience stores, 29 percent from gas stations,
11 percent from grocery stores and 6 percent from drug stores. The
rest said they got them other places.
   The poll was conducted by Response Research of Chicago, which
reported a margin of error of 3.2 percent.
   The company said it used teen-age interviewers in the belief
that answers would be more frank than if adults did the polling.

<HEAD>Inspector General Report: Energy Department Priorities May Not Be
Reliable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $60 million federal attempt to detail
environmental problems at nuclear weapons plants may not be
reliable because Energy Department staff members didn't keep good
notes, the department's inspector general reported Monday.
   The department said it disagreed with the IG's assessment.
   Aides who conducted the three-year survey of environmental
problems at the plants produced poorly organized supporting
documents, said the report by Inspector General John C. Layton.
   The supporting documents were mainly log books with notes taken
in the field. ``They generally were not recorded in complete
sentences and were not detailed enough to function as a memory aid
even to team members, who may be involved in hundreds of findings
at dozens of locations,'' the report said.
   ``The notes were neither indexed nor organized in a way that
would allow anyone to trace facts or conclusions in the reports
back to the source. Team members acknowledged that it would be
difficult and time consuming to locate information in the backup
documents.''
   The $60 million inventory was ordered under Secretary John
Herrington in the Reagan administration. It was not immediately
clear whether it will be used to set cleanup priorities for the
highly contaminated nuclear weapons plants.
   Layton said the shortcomings in the way the plants were
evaluated ``undermine the credibility of the process and call into
question the usefulness of the surveys.''
   Decision-makers ``cannot be assured that the $60 million effort
provides a sound basis for prioritizing environmental problems,''
Layton said in a memo to Energy Secretary James Watkins.
   The Energy Department's response, included in the report, said
the poorly organized records criticized by the inspector general
weren't intended to be reference materials.
   The preliminary reports produced by the field staff were sent to
the various plants, where they ``were not found to be deficient,''
the department said.
   Layton said there's a chance some contamination may not be
adequately indentified, and there's a chance critical projects may
lose limited cleanup money because they weren't put in the right
place on the priority list.
   But the department said the inspector general ``extrapolated
beyond what is reasonable.''
   Layton briefly mentioned his findings during a congressional
hearing last week, but details were not available until the report
came off the press.

<HEAD>Court Rules Government Must Recognize Jewish Conversions Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court decided Monday that the
government must recognize conversions to Judaism by Reform and
Conservative rabbis abroad, starting a new round in a controversy
that has angered many American Jews.
   In another decision, a five-judge panel of the court upheld an
Orthodox monopoly by rejecting an appeal that Reform rabbis be
allowed to perform marriages in Israel.
   The 4-1 ruling on the ``Who is a Jew'' question prompted leaders
of the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party to meet Monday night and
discuss whether to to withdraw support from Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's coalition government. ``We have a secular court
interfering in a religious subject,'' said Agudat legislator
Menachem Porush. The party has five seats of the 120 seats in
Parliament.
   Orthodox rabbis echoed Religious Affairs Minister Zevulun
Hammer's pledge to renew the campaign for a narrower definition of
who is a Jew, Israel radio reported.
   ``The problem remains as an open wound and will not be solved
until it is solved at its roots: that a Jew is a Jew only according
to Halacha,'' Chief Rabbi Avraham Shapira of Israel's European
Jewish Community said on Israel radio. Halacha is orthodox Jewish
law.
   Interior Minister Arye Deri of Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party,
said he would stop signing identity cards issued by his ministry.
``My signature means that information in the identity card is
true,'' he said. ``If the court says I cannot decide about that, I
shall not sign.''
   Israel radio said identity cards would carry a sticker saying
data contained in the ``nationality'' and ``religion'' sections
could not be verified.
   In Washington, Rabbi Eric Yoffie of the Association of Reform
Zionists of America said: ``We're very pleased. What it means is
that the law that currently exists ... will now be enforced.''
   Phil Baum, associate executive director of the American Jewish
Congress, said: ``At a time when there appears to be dissension and
division, this is a welcome affirmation that the common bonds of
Jewish history and fate have endured and continue to bind us into
one people.''
   The court ruling revives an argument over Orthodox efforts to
amend Israel's Law of Return to limit those automatically entitled
to Israeli citizenship.
   Orthodox Jews want to include only Jews born to Jewish mothers
or converted according to Halacha, which in effect would mean by
Orthodox rabbis.
   Current Israeli law also grants automatic citizenship to anyone
who has converted to Judaism and is not a member of another faith.
   The change has been fought by Conservative and Reform rabbis,
whose followers constitute a majority of more than 5 million U.S.
Jews but who have few adherents in Israel. They say the Orthodox
proposal would symbolically excommunicate them from Judaism and
alienate U.S. Jews from Israel.
   Rabbis in the United States make about 11,000 conversions a
year, while Orthodox rabbis perform about 1,000.
   The Supreme Court favored appeals from eight American immigrants
and one from Brazil who were denied Israeli citizenship by the
Interior Ministry.
   The court's ruling said an Israeli Population Register Law of
1965 did not entitle the government to decide the validity of
conversions outside the country.
   ``On this matter, it has no bearing on whether the community
(conducting the conversion) is Orthodox, Conservative or Reform,''
the court said.
   The marriage ruling came on appeals made seven years ago by
Rabbi Moshe Zemer of Baltimore and an Israeli rabbi, Mordechai
Rotem.
   The judges upheld three laws that give Israel's Orthodox rabbis
exclusive rights to decide eligibility for presiding at marriages.

   A paraplegic man using his
arms to hoist himself up set out on a 600-foot pitch Monday in
hopes of making up more than a day in lost time in his quest to
scale the majestic El Capitan rock.
   Mark Wellman, 29, and lead climber Mike Corbett, fresh from
making it over the feared Shield Roof, successfully tackled the
steep Groove pitch. By the end of the day, they hoped to have
climbed nearly twice their average distance since setting out a
week ago.
   A pitch is a climbing distance measured by a single 160-foot
rope length. The pair were at 2,000 feet Monday morning on the
3,593-foot monolith.
   ``They want to get off the wall as soon as possible,'' Lisa
Dapprich, a spokeswoman for Yosemite. ``Their spirits are high; but
they are tired and their hands are swollen.''
   If he is successful, Wellman would become the first paraplegic
to climb one of the world's most challenging cliffs.
   Malori Smith, who is coordinating news coverage, said the two
should complete the climb late Tuesday or early Wednesday. Wellman
has estimated it will take him 7,000 pullups to reach the top.
   Wellman was left paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50
feet during a climb in 1982. He was in the hospital for seven
months but has since stayed in shape with sports like kayaking and
directing the park's program for disabled visitors.
   Corbett has been climbing ahead of Wellman and setting up the
ropes. Wellman then pulls himself up using a T-bar device.

<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher on Monday
temporarily suspended regulations requiring shrimpers to use new
devices intended to protect endangered sea turtles from getting
entangled and dying in their nets.
   Mosbacher's decision came on the heels of weekend protests by
angry shrimpers who blocked ship channels along the Texas Gulf
Coast and threatened violence if the regulations were not changed
or reversed on use of so-called turtle excluders.
   ``We have worked out what I think is a good compromise that
indicates sympathy to the shrimpers and their families as well as
caring about the endangered species in general and the Kemp's
Ridley turtles in particular,'' Mosbacher said after meeting with
gulf state lawmakers.
   Mosbacher said enforcement of the turtle excluder regulations
would be suspended for 45 days. At the end of the period, shrimpers
would be required to pull their nets every 90 minutes but would not
have to use the turtle excluders.
   According to lawmakers, turtles can live for 90 minutes
underwater if trapped in a net.
   After the 45-day period is up, however, the Commerce Department
enforcement staff would issue warnings to shrimpers caught not
pulling their nets after 90 minutes. The agency would re-evaluate
the regulations next year. A study by the National Academy of
Sciences is expected to be completed in February.
   In Galveston, Texas, hundreds of shrimpers awaiting word of
Mosbacher's action at the Galveston Coast Guard station broke into
cheers when they heard the news.
   ``This is a lot more than we though we'd get,'' said Richard
Santini of Galveston, who estimated he lost $6,000 to $7,000 during
the ship channel blockade. ``We can make a living now.''
   In Cameron, La., boat owner Ashful Authement said: ``If they go
for 90 minutes, I can relate to that. But there are some times
(when) it might take you that long to find a good fishing spot and
then you have to stop and pick up.''
   ``At the end of 45 days, it seems like we're facing the same
thing again,'' said Cameron deck hand Paul Miller.
   ``We got a good deal,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``I think
it is a reasonable compromise. It represents a sound way to
approach the problem.''
   But one environmental group planned to organize a national
boycott of shrimp as a result of Mosbacher's action.
   ``The radical action of the secretary of commerce has convinced
us that we need to take some radical action,'' said Mike Weber,
vice president of programs for the Center for Marine Conservation.
   Weber's organization also planned to seek a temporary
restraining order against Mosbacher.
   The shrimpers had contended their business would be ruined by
the turtle excluder regulations.
   In Galveston, Texas, on Monday, shrimpers met with
representatives of the Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the National Marine Fisheries
Service about the rule, which was issued under the federal
Endangered Species Act.
   About 200 shrimp boats on Saturday crowded the deep-water
Houston ship channel and about 300 shrimpers jammed Port Aransas,
gateway to the Port of Corpus Christi, Texas. Those blockades, as
well as similar actions at smaller Texas and Louisiana ports, ended
Sunday pending the outcome of the meetings Monday.
   Ship traffic was reported normal Monday, Coast Guard officials
said.
   The turtle devices are intended to save many of the 11,000
turtles that conservationists estimate are killed each year in
shrimp nets. The devices, which cost from $60 to several hundred
dollars each, are made of wire mesh and have hinged doors to allow
turtles to swim out before the net is pulled aboard a boat.
   Shrimpers say the devices allow valuable shrimp to escape as
well. The shrimpers also complain that the hinged devices are
bulky, dangerous and expensive to operate.
   The rule requiring the devices was to take effect May 1, but its
enforcement has been sporadic.
   Failure to use the devices, which federal officials say cost
shrimpers 6 to 7 percent of their catch, could result in fines of
up to $25,000 and six months in jail.

   The United States cautioned the Soviet Union
against trying to smuggle Felix S. Bloch out of the country weeks
before reports surfaced that the veteran American diplomat was
suspected of being a spy, it was learned Monday.
   President Bush described reports of spying by Bloch as ``very
serious'' but did not offer an assessment of potential damage.
   Two U.S. officials said Bloch had been videotaped handing a
briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris earlier this year. Government
sources also disclosed an unusual level of Soviet interest in
Bloch's case.
   Bloch, stripped of his official passport and State Department
credentials, spent the day with one of his two daughters in a New
York City suburb. State Department officials said he remains on the
payroll, though on leave, and he has not been charged with any
offense.
   It was also learned that Bloch, when stationed in Vienna, had
lobbied to keep Austrian President Kurt Waldheim off the list of
people banned from the United States for past Nazi activities.
   Bloch is refusing through his attorney to be questioned by the
FBI, and only submitted to a short interrogation early in the
investigation by State Department security officers, according to a
government source familiar with the case.
   The Soviets were informed through diplomatic channels, in a
message described as ``discreet,'' that U.S. relations with Moscow
would be damaged if they tried to make off with the 54-year-old
diplomat, a U.S. official disclosed.
   ``So far, they have observed the admonition,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the Soviets were cautioned even as U.S. investigators
were compiling evidence against Bloch but before they had all the
material eventually amassed.
   Another government source familiar with the case told The
Associated Press that the Soviets have exhibited extraordinary
interest in the Bloch case.
   FBI agents tailing Bloch on Saturday as he drove to his
daughter's home outside New York City were followed in turn by
Soviet Embassy personnel, according to this source.
   It could not be learned how many Soviet agents followed the
caravan of FBI agents driving behind Bloch and his family as he
traveled from Washington to Chappaqua, N.Y. Saturday afternoon.
   This source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
unusual Soviet surveillance of the caravan shows ``they have a lot
invested in this.''
   Meanwhile, ABC News reported that a Soviet agent gave Bloch a
warning that he had come under suspicion. The network said U.S.
agents monitoring Bloch's telephone calls heard the same agent who
received the briefcase in Paris advise Bloch by telephone: ``A bad
virus is going around and we believe you are infected.''
   That telephone call came before the FBI first tried to interview
Bloch on June 22, the day he was placed on leave, the network said.
   The State Department did not impose restrictions on his travels,
and doubts were raised that Bloch would ever come to trial.
   Administration sources said U.S. government investigators had
not uncovered any accomplices within the State Department nor were
the Soviets likely to come forward and implicate Bloch, a
54-year-old native of Austria.
   ``He might just end up being retired and put out to pasture,''
an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested.
   Bloch himself has been staying at the home of his daughter,
Kathy Swenson, in Westchester County north of New York City, local
police said.
   On Monday, he walked through woods behind the house in
Chappaqua, jumped into a car she was driving and the pair headed
south toward New York City followed by a parade of federal autos,
police said. She later returned alone.
   Police Chief Steve Fuchila of New Castle, which includes
Chappaqua, said, the FBI had notified him of a surveillance
operation in the area. Bloch's home in Washington also had been
under surveillance for some time before news of the espionage
investigation came out Friday night.
   Bloch discussed the Waldheim case extensively with Foreign
Minister Alois Mock, said the government source who disclosed
Bloch's lobbying.
   ``They were very tight'' from the days in the 1950s when Mock
and the Austrian-born Bloch studied together in Italy, said the
source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   In a move that infuriated many Austrians, Waldheim was placed on
the list in April 1987, a year after the decision was first made to
do so.
   Bloch, who is Jewish, attended the Waldheim inauguration with
approval from the State Department.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman,
acknowledged that Bloch had been back to the department under
escort at least once, to collect personal items and to close his
credit union account.
   She said Bloch, who was director of the Office of Regional
Political-Economic Affairs in the European bureau, probably had
returned on other occasions as well. Visitors are generally
admitted to the State Department if officials in the building vouch
for them.
   Before his suspension, Ms. Tutwiler said in response to
questions, Bloch participated in a decision announced by the
Commerce Department last Tuesday to permit the sale of a broad
range of personal computers to the Soviet Union and Eastern-bloc
countries.
   But, the spokeswoman added, ``I would not characterize him as a
key player.''
   The State Department lined up with the Commerce Department in
recommending the easing of export controls. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney strenuously objected to the decision on security grounds.
   Bush, in his first comments on the spying issue, told reporters
at the White House: ``I have known about this matter for some time
and the minute I heard about it I was aggrieved because it is a
very tragic thing should the allegations be true.''
   The president declined to discuss details of the case. But, he
said, ``any time a person is ... allegedly involved in something
like betraying his country, that to me is a very serious matter.''
   Asked about possible damage to U.S. security, Bush, a former CIA
director, replied: ``I don't think anyone could give you a full
damage assessment'' at this time. He added that the allegations, if
true, would not help improve relations with the Soviet Union even
though ``espionage goes on'' all the time.
   After returning from Austria in 1987 after an unusually long
seven-year stint as deputy ambassador, Bloch was assigned to the
senior seminar program at the State Department.
   But an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, questioned
reports that Bloch was disappointed he had not been named an
ambassador and that the job amounted to a step down.
   ``It's not a parking lot kind of job,'' the official said.
   He said of the Bloch case: ``There has to be a presumption of
innocence.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Monday the
strikes in Soviet coalfields were the biggest test of his four-year
economic reforms _ worse than the Chernobyl disaster _ and he
called for a shake-up of local councils often blamed for blocking
progress.
   Gorbachev appealed last week for a ``renewal'' of Communist
Party ranks from top to bottom, and his suggestion that local
governing bodies also be transformed could mean sweeping leadership
changes.
   Local elections scheduled in the spring throughout the Soviet
Union involve multiple candidates and for the first time offer
serious challenges to entrenched officials.
   Some members of the national legislature, the Supreme Soviet,
said Monday the elections should be held earlier. Gorbachev said
each Soviet republic should decide when and how to hold the
elections.
   He said party and government bodies as well as official trade
unions should meet urgently to analyze the two-week strike that at
its peak idled half the Soviet Union's 1 million coal industry
workers and deprived vital factories of fuel.
   The Kremlin chief told legislators almost all the miners have
returned to work.
   ``We are coming out of a very serious crisis, the biggest test
during the four years of perestroika,'' Gorbachev said.
   He said the test was even more severe than the April 1986
explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that killed
31 people, cost millions of dollars to clean up and sparked a
nationwide environmental protection movement.
   The strikes dealt a serious blow to the economy, Gorbachev said,
but he reassured his countrymen that ``our perestroika will give
results despite the tests we are undergoing.''
   He blamed Coal Ministry and local officials rather than the
miners, but warned, ``deciding such questions by striking will ruin
our work.''
   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin told the Supreme Soviet that
local party and government leaders have been inactive and
insensitive to people's needs because ``they know they won't be
re-elected.''
   Gorbachev said that because of the strike, governing councils
should not wait for elections to make changes.
   ``Ripe questions require sessions without delay to discuss
reports of regional executive committees, and where it is necessary
to take personnel decisions, they must be taken without waiting for
elections,'' he said.
   Several heads already have rolled, Tass official news agency
reported. It said the party chief and mayor of Stakhanov in the
Donetsk Basin ``were forced to leave their posts,'' apparently
under pressure from strikers.
   One legislator suggested strike committees be absorbed into
local governing councils because they proved they can get things
done.
   In a meeting last Tuesday with party officials, Gorbachev said
the party also needs ``a flow of fresh blood, and ... to be renewed
at the level of the work place, the locality, the city, the region,
the republic, the central committee and the Politburo.''
   He said Monday that party bodies should analyze reasons for the
strikes, which miners started to press for better supplies of food,
consumer goods and housing as well as higher pay and better working
conditions.
   He balked at calls for independent unions, suggesting instead
the official unions ``think over what happened and what to do to
make sure unions carry out their role.''
   Deputies speaking at Monday's nationally broadcast session said
the country needs better unions.
   ``We have to admit the trade unions don't have the workers'
faith,'' said Lithuanian deputy Kazimeras Uoka. ``We have to give
them the right to establish independent trade unions.''
   Soviet unions act as djuncts of the government, handling
distribution of benefits rather than fighting for workers' rights.
   Several deputies from mining regions also called for moving up
local elections to this fall to give voters a chance to oust
insensitive officials.
   Gorbachev said such decisions should be taken in the 15 Soviet
republics, not in Moscow, even if it means election laws and
schedules will vary.
   ``Shall we torpedo and limit this?'' he asked. ``We will hardly
succeed, commanding from here.''
   The Soviet president said at least half the 300,000 striking
miners in the Donetsk Basin, the country's biggest coal-producing
area, have returned to work. Tass said about 50 of the region's 121
mines remain idle.
   Donetsk strikers were among the last holdouts from a nationwide
coal strike that started July 11 in western Siberia and spread from
the Arctic to Central Asia. Last week, the government granted
concessions and Siberian miners returned to work.
   A strike leader in Donetsk, in the Ukraine 550 miles south of
Moscow, said by telephone that workers are awaiting ``decisive
guarantees'' from the Supreme Soviet that the government will keep
promises made to miners Saturday. The Supreme Soviet took no action
Monday to guarantee the pact, instead juggling legislation to give
priority to strike issues.
   A deputy from the Pechora coal basin in the Arctic told the
Supreme Soviet that miners around the city of Vorkuta remain on
strike, partly because of media ``disinformation.'' Miner Vladimir
P. Lushnikov said state media reported erroneously that the Vorkuta
strike had ended.
   Reports said miners remained on strike at 11 of 13 Vorkuta mines
and all 12 mines in Chervonograd in the western Ukraine.
   Viktor G. Kucherenko, head of the Supreme Soviet's Planning and
Budget Commission, said the strike settlements probably will cost
between $4.6 billion and $8.6 billion.

<HEAD>Government Approves Private Rocket From California In August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A test model of a craft that could be used to
return astronauts from Space Station Freedom will be tested in a
suborbital launch in August by a private California firm, an
official said Monday.
   James C. Bennett, acting president of the American Rocket Co.,
headquartered in Camarillo, Calif., said his firm will launch a
single stage rocket to an altitude of 100 miles carrying a model of
a space station crew return craft developed by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   He said the model, about a one-third scale, will test a ``novel
experimental concept'' called a parashield.
   The device, shaped rather like an umbrella, will be used to
protect the model during the high-speed portions of its return to
Earth, and then will turn and act as an airbrake as the atmospheric
thickens.
   Bennett said the primary purpose of the mission was to test the
parashield behavior during its fall toward Earth.
   The experimental craft weighs about 600 pounds and will be
recovered after falling into the sea about 135 miles off shore from
the Vandenberg Air Force Base launch site.
   Data will be collected by instruments on board and through the
use of long-range photography, he said.
   A secondary payload on the flight will be a Department of
Defense experiment.
   The Department of Transportation announced Monday that it was
granting a commercial license to American Rocket for the launch.
   Bennett said the launch will use an unusual hybrid rocket engine
developed by the company. The rocket is powered by a solid fuel,
but uses liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. In this way, he said, the
rocket design has the safety advantages of a liquid-fueled rocket,
with the dependability of a solid rocket.
   Hydrid rockets, he said, can be turned on and off like a liquid
rocket by controlling the flow of oxygen. But the hybrid is safer
than a solid fuel rocket because the propellant is not explosive.
   The launch will be the first by the American Rocket Co. and the
first commercial launch from Vandenberg, a center used by the Air
Force to launch polar orbiting craft and to test intercontinental
ballistics missiles.
   Four earlier commercial launch licenses have been granted by the
DOT and the department is reviewing eight other applications, the
announcement said.
   Space Station Freedom, a permanent laboratory and crew quarters
to be assembled in orbit in the mid-1990s, is to include a craft
that can be used by astronauts for an emergency return to Earth.
The MIT model is to test a concept for that craft.

   Lawmakers unveiled draft legislation Monday to
impose a ceasefire in the battle over logging in the ancient
forests of the Pacific Northwest, but objections from a Vermont
senator sidetracked plans for immediate subcommittee action on the
bill.
   Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Brock Adams, D-Wash., planned
to ask the full Senate Appropriations Committee to approve the
legislation Tuesday despite concerns from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   Leahy, both at the beginning of the interior appropriations
subcommittee meeting and in a letter to full Committee Chairman
Robert Byrd, D-W.V., said he was ``deeply disturbed'' that
provisions in the bill might preempt the right of environmentalists
to appeal timber sales to the courts.
   Leahy's skepticism dampened the excitement of the bill's
sponsors who hope to ensure an adequate supply of logs to keep the
region's mills operating over the next 14 months, as well as
protect some of the old-growth forests that are prime habitat for
the northern spotted owl.
   The bill calls for the sale of 10 billion board feet of timber
off of the national forests and Bureau of Land Management lands in
Oregon and Washington over the next 14 months.
   Hatfield said that is about 10 percent less than the amount of
timber that would be sold if some sales weren't blocked by lawsuits
to protect the spotted owl.
   In addition, the plan discourages logging significantly large
blocks of old-growth forests, a policy known as ``minimum
fragmentation.''
   Under the proposal, significant stands of old-growth would have
at least eight trees per acre that are at least 300 years old or
are 40 inches in diameter. Environmentalists would be allowed to
release 1.25 billion board feet of the almost 2 billion board feet
of timber sales currently enjoined by federal courts in Portland
and Seattle.
   ``I am concerned that an appeal and judicial exemption process
that started with isolated sales could expand to a region, and may
soon become national in scope,'' said Leahy, who also is chairman
of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which has jurisdiction over
the U.S. Forest Service.
   Leahy, who has close ties to environmental groups, said he was
well aware that forest products were ``essential to the economic
health'' of the region, but added the right of appeal was ``also of
vital importance.''
   Hatfield agreed to postpone consideration of the bill until the
full committee meeting.
   The sales have been temporarily enjoined by pending lawsuits
that claim over-logging in old-growth forests is threatening the
northern spotted owl with extinction. The owl hunts and nests
almost exclusively in ancient forests.
   The agreement would prohibit environmentalists from using
injunctions to block timber sales in the next fiscal year, which
starts Oct. 1.

<HEAD>Forest Fires in Manitoba Force Evacuation of 18,000</HEAD>
<UNK>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE and add details. No pickup.</UNK>
<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forest fires raging through northern
Manitoba have forced the evacuation of more than 18,000 people, and
smoke and flames threatened to block some escape routes.
   The airport in Thompson was reopened Monday after radar
equipment was flown in to help guide airplanes. Pilots were unable
to locate the runways because of the dense smoke.
   Convoys of trucks loaded with food and fuel and escorted by
police drove north from Winnipeg to reach Thompson about 470 miles
away. Some 4,000 evacuees were being sheltered in Thompson, a
mining town with a normal population of 15,000. The fires were
several miles away from Thompson and there was no immediate threat
to the town.
   Just east of Thompson firefighters sprayed water on a wooden
bridge of a railroad used to move evacuees.
   ``If that bridge goes out then that escape route is cut off to
Churchill,'' Manitoba Natural Resources Minister Harry Enns told a
news conference.
   Churchill is a Hudson Bay port city 260 miles northeast of
Thompson. The railroad also links Thompson to the south.
   Enns said all available equipment was being used to evacuate
people and to block flames from sweeping through communities.
   Officials said only a few houses have burned and they had no
reports of injuries or deaths.
   Scores of fires have broken out in parched northern Manitoba in
recent weeks, but winds fanned the blazes last week and they now
form a belt more than 200 miles wide beginning about 240 miles
north of Winnipeg. Evacuations started Thursday as flames
threatened communities.
   Officials said fires in northern Saskatchewan forced 1,200
residents of Sandy Bay to flee their homes Saturday. They said that
in northwestern Ontario, 400 people living at Bearskin Lake were
flown out Thursday.
   The fires have swept through at least 2 million acres of brush
and timber in a mainly flat area.
   Military transport planes, trains and private vehicles were
being used to remove people from threatened towns in Manitoba in
what is believed to be the largest evacuation in the province's
history. Officials said 13 towns have been completely evacuated
since Thursday and a number of other towns were either partly
evacuated or the residents were on standby.
   About 8,500 people were evacuated when floods ravaged Manitoba
in 1950.
   Manitoba officials estimated there are about 250 fires in the
fire belt, but they said the figures are uncertain.
   ``There is too much smoke; we can't even see the new fires,''
said Karin Batke of Manitoba's natural resources department.
   Manitoba officials said at least 1,500 firefighters, 53
helicopters, 11 waterbombers, nine fixed-wing aircraft and heavy
equipment including bulldozers have been thrown into the battle.
   A state of emergency was declared Sunday by Albert Driedger,
Manitoba's minister of emergency measures. Retired or vacationing
civil servants were asked to report for duty as exhausted relief
workers toiled around the clock.
   ``Virtually all of northern Manitoba is on fire, and we're just
hoping some of our major centers are not going to be affected,''
Driedger said. ``Once you get 15 minutes out of Winnipeg, all you
see is smoke.''
   Lightning is blamed for most of the fires, but police believe
people started at least two.
   Weather forecasts said there could be thundershowers in the
areas, but the storms could cause more lightning-set fires.

   The Hunt brothers' bank creditors sought
control of their business empire after the silver price collapse of
March 1980 left the Texas investors up to $2 billion in debt, Lamar
Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, testified Monday.
   ``I was told that the banks wanted to put their arms around all
of the Hunts,'' Hunt told U.S. Tax Court Judge Jules G. Korner III.
``And by the Hunts I mean Bunker, Herbert and me. And they wanted
to control all of the operations of the Hunts.''
   Lamar and his other brothers, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert,
are in U.S. Tax Court contesting a total of more than $300 million
in taxes the Internal Revenue Services says is owed from the 1982
dissolution of a partnership set up to repay their debts after
silver price collapse.
   Under the partnership agreement, the family's Placid Oil Co.
contributed $824 million of a $1.1 billion loan it obtained from a
consortium of banks. Under a Federal Reserve directive at the time,
banks were not allowed to lend on silver investments.
   The brothers in turn contributed silver, gold stocks, and coal
properties in North Dakota.
   Lamar testified the banks insisted he be included in the
partnership with his brothers, as well as serve as a guarantor,
although he said he had no outstanding bank debts on silver at the
time.
   ``The banks were insisting I be in the partnership,'' Lamar
said. ``The banks wanted to put their arms now only around Herbert
and Bunker but they wanted to put their arms around me ... and that
was the way it was presented to me.
   ``I was told the banks were dictating the wording and the terms
of the agreement,'' Hunt said.
   Asked if he had pledged all his assets, including his Rolex
watch, Hunt said: ``Yes, the famous watch.''
   Bunker testified last week that the banks had demanded as
collateral ``paintings on the wall'' and his brother's Rolex.
   Bunker and Herbert each are contesting more than $150 million in
1982 taxes, while Lamar is contesting $505,377 in taxes.
   Lamar said he lost about $15 million on his silver investments,
which began in 1974. At the height of his silver investing, Hunt
said he had 1,600 futures contracts, each for 5,000 ounces of
silver.
   Lamar, like Bunker, blamed restrictions on silver investors by
the commodities markets for the silver price collapse.
   In a pending case however, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission has accused Bunker and Herbert of attempting to corner
the silver market. It says they owned one-third of the world's
silver bullion when prices collapsed. A jury in New York last year
found Bunker, Herbert and two others had conspired to manipulate
and monopolize the silver market and defraud investors.
   The two ex-billionaires now owe $250 million in fines and
interest in that lawsuit, brought by Minpeco, the Peruvian silver
mining company.

   Authorities on Monday recovered the
body of a teen-ager who had clung to a rescue rope in swift waters
in a flood-control channel but lost his grip when he was hit by
debris.
   The body of Peter Alvarado, 17, was discovered in the Alameda
Arroya, said Anthony Garcia, a member of the aquatic rescue team of
the Bernalillo County Fire Department.
   The body was recovered 10 to 12 miles away from where Alvarado
and his brother, David, 14, were skateboarding Sunday in a concrete
flood-control channel when they were hit by a 3-foot-high wall of
water.
   The National Weather Service said an inch of rain fell in the
area in less than an hour.
   David was rescued and was treated for cuts and bruises at St.
Joseph Hospital, Fire Department spokesman Ernie Watson said.
   Firefighters had tried to pull out Peter Alvarado as he clung to
a rope Sunday, but a sudden surge of water carried a floating chair
into him, forcing him to let go.
   At least 10 people, including four police officers and four
firefighters, were injured trying to rescue the brothers.
   Clayton Mitsui, 23, and Manuel Rubio, 17, who were attending a
church picnic near the channel, were pulled in as they tried to
rescue the Alvarados.
   Firefighters and police rushed to various points along the
channel and threw ropes across to try to stop the men.
   Police officer John Bode went into the channel and grabbed one
person, but lost his grip. Bode clung to a rope across the channel
as other officers and bystanders struggled to pull him out, forming
a chain along the steep, slippery walls of the channel.
   Meanwhile, firefighter Lawrence Padilla reached for Mitsui with
a long pole but got pulled in. Padilla had on a life vest and tried
to keep hold of Mitsui.
   ``There were a few times he said, `That's it. I can't go any
farther.' I said, `Hey, we're in this together.' I started talking
to him, and he relaxed. I knew someone would get us,'' Padilla said.
   The two were eventually rescued after traveling 1{ miles down
the channel.
   Rubio also was rescued, grabbing a rope thrown to him by
firefighters.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects State's Move to Block New Trial for Gary Dotson</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with prosecutor's comments, genetic tests,
other details.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A circuit judge on Monday rejected efforts to
block a new trial for a convicted rapist who is on parole and whose
victim recanted her charges four years ago.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald ruled that
genetic test results obtained by Gary Dotson's attorneys constitute
important new evidence. He denied two motions by prosecutors to
dismiss a petition for a new trial.
   Defense attorney Thomas Breen said the ruling paves the way for
a trial that will finally vindicate Dotson.
   ``It's great,'' Breen said after the hearing. ``We're 90 percent
there.''
   But Assistant State's Attorney Gayle Shines said it was
speculation to talk of a new trial. She said the state will outline
its position at a hearing Aug. 14. At that point, Fitzgerald will
schedule a hearing that likely will determine whether a new trial
will take place.
   Ms. Shines said prosecutors have not decided what approach to
take regarding the evidence that Dotson's attorneys say proves he
did not rape Cathleen Crowell Webb.
   Breen said genetic-test results prove that semen found on the
underpants worn by Ms. Webb the night in July 1977 when she said
she was raped was not Dotson's.
   But Ms. Shines said the defense has failed to prove the test
results have ``a substantial probability'' of changing the outcome
of the original trial, a requirement for granting a new trial based
on new evidence.
   And under state law, evidence of semen is not required to prove
that a rape occurred, she said. ``Evidence that Gary Dotson was not
the seminal donor cannot by itself change the results of the
trial,'' Ms. Shines said.
   She also argued that the statute of limitations on a bid for a
new trial expired two years after Dotson's 1979 conviction on
charges of rape and aggravated kidnapping.
   Fitzgerald rejected the argument, noting Breen's petition
contends that some evidence in the case was fraudulently concealed,
which would override the law.
   Dotson was not present, but a sister attended the hearing.
``We're going to prove once and for all that he didn't do it,''
said Laura Dotson, 26.
   Dotson was sentenced to a 25- to 50-year prison term after his
conviction. But in 1985, Ms. Webb recanted her testimony. Now a
Jaffrey, N.H., homemaker, she said she made up the attack because
she feared she had become pregnant by her boyfriend.
   Gov. James R. Thompson granted Dotson clemency, saying his
punishment had been sufficient. But the governor said he did not
believe Ms. Webb's about-face, and has refused to pardon Dotson.
   Dotson, 32, remains in an alcoholism treatment center as a
condition of his parole last August. He had been returned to prison
in December 1987 for a parole violation.
   Since his 1985 release, Dotson has had recurring minor problems
with the law, mostly driving violations. He also had faced two
misdemeanor battery charges, one stemming from an altercation in a
bar and the other prompted by an allegation of abuse from his wife.
Both charges were dropped.
   Dotson married shortly after his release. The couple have a
daughter.

   A man suspected of spying for the Soviets
walked through the woods behind his daughter's home Monday, jumped
into the car she was driving and headed south, followed by a parade
of federal autos.
   ``We knew he was there and that he left,'' said New Castle
Police Chief Steve Fuchila. He would not give details of the
departure, but other officers who were at the scene said Felix
Bloch left the house by the back door and went through the woods
where he was picked up by his daughter, Kathy Swenson.
   The car headed south on the Saw Mill River Parkway, the federal
cars in tow, said the officers, who declined to be identified. The
parkway leads south to New York City.
   The daughter returned alone at 6 p.m., carrying shopping bags.
She entered a next-door neighbor's house.
   When Bloch drove to his daughter's house on Saturday, FBI agents
tailed him and were followed in turn by Soviet Embassy personnel,
according to a government source familiar with the case.
   The local police chief said the FBI had notified him of a
surveillance operation in the area, but did not disclose details.
However, a police source said the Hamilton Road residence had been
under federal observation for several days before Friday, when
reports surfaced that Bloch, a 30-year veteran of the State
Department, had been filmed last spring exchanging a briefcase with
a known KGB agent.
   There are no formal charges against Bloch and U.S. officials
have declined to go beyond confirming that he is the target of an
intelligence investigation and no longer has access to the State
Department building.
   Joseph Valiquette, the New York-area FBI spokesman, would not
comment.
   Chappaqua is a quiet, affluent community in northern Westchester
County, is part of the Town of New Castle. Houses in Mrs. Swenson's
neighborhood, which is not the ritziest area of the hamlet, sell
for $400,000 and up.
   The house was dark and shuttered, except for two open windows on
the second floor. Part of the yard recently had been worked on, and
a bag of weeds and lawn clippings had been left out.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reconsidering Historic Topeka Schools Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court is reconsidering Brown vs.
Topeka Board of Education after withdrawing a recent ruling in
which it revived the historic case, a court official said Monday.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver last week
withdrew its June 2 decision in the desegregation case without
explanation.
   ``It's as if there had been no opinion ever filed,'' said Robert
Hoecker, the court's clerk. ``They will reconsider the case.''
   Hoecker said he did not know if the court would hold new
hearings or base the new decision on existing testimony and
evidence. He also said he did not know why the decision was made.
   Attorneys in the case said they found out about the withdrawal
Friday and were unsure what the action means for the Topeka, Kan.,
school system.
   ``This is purely my speculation. I think somewhere in the
dissent someone is criticizing somebody else, and the majority
wants an opportunity to respond to that criticism,'' said Rich
Jones, a Topeka lawyer who represents the plaintiffs in the
35-year-old case.
   In 1987, U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers of Topeka ruled that
Topeka's public school district no longer had any illegal or
intentional separation of races.
   In June, the appeals court overturned Rogers' ruling, saying the
Topeka school system had not done enough to overcome remnants of
the segregated school system that existed before the U.S. Supreme
Court decided the landmark Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education case
in 1954. The appeals court ordered Rogers to devise a remedy for
what it called the racially identifiable schools in Topeka.
   Topeka Superintendent Gary Livingston said he and his staff are
still unsure what the appeals court action means, and he will be
meeting with attorneys.
   The 1954 Supreme Court decision held that the ``separate but
equal'' concept for public schools was unconstitutional.
   The case was reopened in 1979 when the parents of 17 Topeka
public schoolchildren sought a decision on whether the schools had
eliminated traces of the segregated system. The parents included
Linda Brown Buckner, who as a student in 1954 gave the case its
name.

   ABC News made ``a terrible mistake'' when it
did not clearly label photos shown on its evening news show as a
staged reenactment of a spying investigation, a network official
said Monday.
   The blunder in Friday's ``World News Tonight,'' segment on
veteran American diplomat Felix S. Bloch, might have led some
viewers to believe that they were watching videotaped frames of
Bloch giving a briefcase to a Soviet agent.
   But the network's two still pictures of the transaction were
created by ABC News staffers and were not taken from FBI footage of
an alleged Bloch encounter with a Soviet agent in Paris, ABC News
officials said Monday.
   Bloch has not been charged with any wrongdoing, but he has been
placed on leave and has had his diplomat's building pass and
security clearances revoked.
   ``It was a terrible mistake'' not to identify clearly the news
simulation as such, Richard Wald, senior vice president of ABC
News, said Monday in a telephone interview. ``I regret it.''
   Nonetheless, Wald defended reenactments in general, saying they
should be seen as extensions of courtroom sketches.
   At least one media critic took a different point of view.
   ``I think that (recreations) are pure poison,'' said Ben
Bagdikian, the former dean of the graduate journalism school at the
University of California, Berkeley. ``Since the Fox network got its
ratings with `America's Most Wanted,' it's clearly an imitation of
that. It's docudrama as news.''
   The ABC simulation lasted about 10 seconds and included two
grainy, still shots of one man handing a briefcase to another.
   ABC correspondent John McWethy's narration at the time said ``it
was not until earlier this year that Bloch was videotaped handing
over a briefcase to a known Soviet agent on the streets of a
European capital.''
   The sequence failed to include a ``simulation'' advisory in the
upper left corner of the screen, as is customary and required
practice of the network.
   The staged frames were followed by a brief videotape of a street
scene, with two men walking across an intersection. The video
featured a running time code in the lower right corner and a
blinking cross hair, suggesting real surveillance footage. That
scene was clearly labeled as a simulation.
   Later that same evening, in a subsequent transmission of the
Peter Jennings-anchored newscast, the ``simulation'' credit was
present for all of the newscast's reenactments.
   Wald said that the majority of ABC affiliates used the first
version, without the simulation notice.
   ABC newsroom guidelines say it should be made explicitly clear
that the audience is watching a news simulation, according to ABC
spokeswoman Elise Adde.

<HEAD>Reports Gaugin Painting Stolen From Heathrow Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Monday they are investigating the
reported theft from London's Heathrow airport of a Paul Gaugin
painting owned by the Beadlestone Gallery of New York.
   The London Daily Mail newspaper said the painting was valued at
more than $1.9 million and was stolen from a cargo hangar at the
airport.
   It said the watercolor measuring nine inches by four inches is
titled ``Tahitienne en Pareo Rouge'' _ Tahitian woman in a red
skirt.
   Gaugin, a Frenchman born in 1848, lived and painted in Tahiti in
the South Pacific from 1895 until his death in 1903.
   Scotland Yard, in a brief statement about the reported theft,
said, ``The matter is the subject of an inquiry by the Criminal
Investigation Department at Heathrow.''
   The Daily Mail said the painting was one of four pictures that
arrived at Heathrow on a British Airways flight from New York on
June 21.
   It said the consignment remained in the British Airways cargo
hangar until the owners arrived to collect them five days later.
Each painting was in a separate box and only the one containing the
Gaugin painting was missing, according to the newspaper. It gave no
information about the three other painting.
   The Daily Mail said the theft was not reported to police until
Sunday, but it gave no reason for the delayed report.
   It quoted the Beadlestone Gallery's New York director Susan
Seidel as saying: ``It is a work of art of the very finest quality.
It was to have been part of an exhibition at our London gallery.''

   The Delaware Supreme Court on Monday
allowed Time Inc. to proceed with its $14 billion offer for Warner
Communications Inc., and Paramount Communications Inc. dropped its
$12.2 billion hostile bid for Time.
   The ruling paves the way for Time and Warner to create the
world's largest communications concern, Time Warner Inc.
   Paramount and some of Time's shareholders had asked a
three-justice state Supreme Court panel to overturn a ruling by
Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen.
   Like many of the other biggest U.S. corporations, Time, Warner
and Paramount are incorporated in Delaware and subject to its laws.
   Allen had ruled that the proposed Time-Warner deal announced in
March, three months before Paramount launched its bid, was the
result of long-term business planning and that Paramount and Time's
shareholders could not interfere.
   Michael Klein, an attorney for some of the Time shareholders,
said that because Monday's ruling upholding Allen was unanimous,
the decision would not be appealed to the full state Supreme Court,
which has five justices.
   Paramount issued a statement saying it was ending its bid for
Time but would continue to try to expand.
   ``We believe in making bold moves when they are in the best
interest of Paramount Communications shareholders,'' Paramount
Chairman Martin Davis said. ``We have just demonstrated that in our
offer for Time ....''
   Time's $70-a-share tender offer for Warner expired at 5 p.m. EDT
and Time announced it held more than 117 million Warner shares, or
about 58 percent of the company's outstanding common stock. Time
said it would announce Tuesday the exact number of shares tendered
under its offer.
   Under the offer, Time was to purchase slightly more than half of
Warner's common stock and exchange a combination of cash and
securities valued at $70 a share for the rest. Time said it would
begin paying for the tendered shares on July 31.
   Investors sold off Time stock during Monday's hearing _ which
was televised live by Cable News Network. The company's shares were
down $1.25 to $137.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading
after the decision was announced. Warner rose $1 to $66.50 a share
and Paramount was up 87{ cents to $58.37{ a share.
   Time said its plans to merge with Warner would give shareholders
greater value in the long term than Paramount's $200-a-share offer.
Paramount argued that the Warner-Time deal was economically
inferior to its offer and detrimental to Time shareholders.
   The justices closely questioned Paramount and Time shareholder
attorneys during the hearing.
   Justice Andrew G.T. Moore asked Michael Klein, an attorney for
some of Time's biggest shareholders, if they were demanding that
``we must hold that a board is hostage to any person who walks in
and makes a bid no matter what the long-term plans are.''
   The justices asked Time attorney Robert Joffe why the
$70-a-share offer for Warner _ which replaced an earlier stock-swap
merger plan _ was not submitted to a vote by Time shareholders at
the company's annual meeting in June.
   Joffe said a vote was not required because the deal did not
involve the issuing of new Time stock.
   Paramount attorney Melvyn Cantor contended that Delaware law
required Time's board to inquire into Paramount's bid, and noted
the Supreme Court in a previous case had ``held that the failure to
inquire is gross negligence.''
   Time defended the right of its directors to determine the
company's future course, and said previous Delaware Supreme Court
cases allow a board to refuse to consider offers that threaten
long-term plans.
   Time will pay $70 per share for half of Warner's 200 million
outstanding shares. Time will later exchange $70 in a combination
of cash and securities for the remaining shares.
   Separately, The Wall Street Journal reported that about 500
Warner executives and employees would be paid a total of about $677
million under stock, option and bonus plans if the deal with Warner
goes through.
   The Journal said the payments, disclosed in minutes of a Warner
board meeting June 15, amounted to the largest compensation package
for employees of a company involved in a takeover.
   Warner Chairman Steven Ross would receive $193 million in
payments and would also receive options on 1.8 million Time Warner
shares, the Journal said.

   Hazardous materials experts reassured
hundreds of displaced families Monday that fumes from a chemical
fire won't hurt their homes, and one official said even garden
vegetables will be edible.
   The experts were monitoring a burning tank car that forced
officials to keep a 15 square-mile area cordoned off for a third
day Monday.
   Meanwhile, a CSX railroad spokesman reported that the brakeman
on the CSX freight train, which derailed Saturday, checked himself
into a local hospital's substance abuse program that night.
   Within hours of the derailment, the brakeman and other crew
members submitted blood and urine samples for federally required
drug and alcohol testing, said R. Lindsay Leckie, senior manager of
news and information for the railroad. The brakeman later told
railroad officials he wanted to enter the hospital's drug and
alcohol abuse program, Leckie said.
   Leckie emphasized that human error had been ruled out as a cause
of the derailment, and that brakeman's decision wasn't expected to
alter that.
   The brakeman was riding in the first of two locomotives pulling
tank cars on a run from Port Huron to Midland and was not at the
controls when the train derailed, said Leckie and William Loftus,
executive director of the Federal Railroad Administration.
   Test results on the entire crew were expected later this week,
Leckie said.
   Some people forced from their homes by the fiery derailment,
meanwhile, said they wanted to move even if everything is OK.
   ``I've always had a gut feeling something would happen. I've
always looked at those tank cars and wondered what kind of poison
was in them,'' said Stanley Siminski, 77, who lives near the
railroad tracks.
   ``My wife and I are talking about getting out. I don't know if
we'll be able to sell now.''
   Gladys Gott, who lives three-quarters of a mile from the
derailment, said she also wants to move. ``I don't think I'll feel
safe,'' she said. ``You don't know what that stuff is.''
   The tracks where the derailment occurred have been used for more
than 10 years to carry toxic chemicals between Freeport, Texas, and
nearby Midland, on a regularly scheduled run known as the Unit
Train.
   Experts decided Monday to speed up the burning of the chemical
by pumping air into the car and boosting the fire, which burst from
a gash in the car.
   The chemical, chlorosilene, emits hydrochloric acid as it burns,
but Steve Buser, director of hazardous materials for CSX, said the
amounts were low and were dissipating into the air.
   Buser said it was impossible to tell how long it would take the
chemical to burn away, but he said he believed little was left in
the tank car.
   At the car, the amount of acid in the air was within safety
limits and 150 yards away monitors detected none, he said, adding
that houses, cars, and other personal possessions wouldn't be
damaged.
   Food from gardens would be safe after it was thoroughly washed,
said Rod Jordan of the Michigan Department of Agriculture.
   Leckie said 250 to 350 people had registered with the Red Cross
to get the railroad to pay for motel rooms, meals and clothing.
   Other evacuees had gone to stay with friends and relatives,
Leckie said. The railroad also will pay businesses forced to close
by the evacuation and reimburse pay lost by those unable to go to
work, he added.
   Investigators from CSX, the National Transportation Safety
Board, and the Federal Railroad Administration said it was too
early to determine the cause of the crash.
   Calls for slower speeds for trains carrying hazardous materials
were answered by the state government Monday.
   ``Train speed is just one factor. You could have equipment
failure contributing to it also. You can't say that speed, whether
it's going 25 or 40 mph, would be a contributing factor. The track
condition is good for 40 mph,'' said Don Riel, assistant
administrator of the Rail Safety and Traffic Division of the
Michigan Department of Transportation.
   The train was traveling at 37 mph when it derailed, officials
said.

   A Navy jet used to
jam enemy radar crashed on takeoff during a training run Monday,
killing two of its three crew members.
   A third crew member was ``in good shape'' listed in stable
condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego, said a Navy
spokesman, Lt. Jack Papp.
   The twin-engine EA-6B Prowler went down at 5:27 p.m. at this
base on the Coronado Peninsula near San Diego, Papp said.
   ``It was just at the end of its takeoff. ... It crashed just as
it reached the end of the runway,'' he said. ``There was nothing
left. The plane's a complete loss.''
   ``The air station has ceased all flights right now,'' he added.
   The plane was from the VAQ 129 training squadron based at
Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Washington state, Papp said.
   The Prowler is designed to be launched from a carrier and to jam
land-based enemy radar during long-range bombing missions, Papp
said. The crash was being investigated.

<TEXT>
   The Turkish Cypriot government released
early Tuesday all 82 Greek Cypriot women who were jailed six days
ago for staging an anti-Turkish demonstration.
   Hundreds of Greek Cypriots, including President George
Vassiliou, welcomed the women at the police academy in the Greek
Cypriot sector of the divided capital.
   Sobbing with relief the freed women sang the Greek national
anthem to the cheers of the welcoming crowd.
   The women were driven to the academy in a convoy of United
Nations peace-force buses following their release from a prison in
the Turkish-occupied zone of Nicosia.
   A total of 108 Greek Cypriots _ 98 women and 10 men _ were
arrested Wednesday on the 15th anniversary of the Turkish invasion
while demonstrating in the U.N.-buffer zone dividing the east
Mediterranean island.
   They were charged with violating the border of the Turkish
Cypriot state, which is recognized only by Turkey.
   Sixteen girls, all under the age of 18, were released Sunday and
Monday. The 10 men, including Bishop Chrysostomos, another Greek
Orthodox priest, a doctor and two journalists, are still held.
   The release of the women followed mass demonstrations by Greek
Cypriots and a 5-day sit-in blocking the main entrance to the U.N.
headquarters by hundreds of women.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Thursday
called for the release of all of the prisoners.
   He also cricized both the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and the
Turkish Cypriot police for entering the U.N. buffer zone.
   Eleni Vrahimi, a lawyer and one of the organizers of Wednesday's
demonstration, said she and all of the other prisoners had been
``severely beaten'' by Turkish Cypriot police.
   ``The trial before a Turkish Cypriot court was a mockery and a
parody of justice,'' she said. ``There are no borders in Cyprus and
we were protesting the Turkish occupation in the yards of a Greek
Cypriot school and a church when the Turkish forces seized us.''
   Vassilou told the crowd, ``The release of the women shows that
humanity is not prepared to accept the violation of human rights.''
He expressed hope the 10 men would be freed soon.
   The conflict caused by the demonstration and arrests threatened
to wreck the 11-month-old U.N.-sponsored peace talks between
Vassiliou and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on reunification
of the island.
   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized 40 percent of its territory. Turkey said the troops were
sent to protect the Turkish Cypriots who comprise 17 percent of the
island's population.
   Turkey launched the invasion after a short-lived coup by Greek
Cypriots seeking a union with Greece.

   The Cabinet on Monday approved a proposal by
Finance Minister Shimon Peres to allocate $137.5 million for a
public works program designed to reduce the country's high
unemployment.
   The decision came a day after about 1 million civil servants,
bank employees and airport and factory workers walked off their
jobs for two hours to protest the worsening job situation.
   Labor Ministry officials said Israel's unemployment rate was 9.7
percent in May, the highest since a 1965-67 recession when the rate
reached 12.4 percent.
   Peres said funds for the public works program would come from
other areas and overall budget spending would not increase. He said
he planned to cut $30 million from the budget of the state-run
Electric Company and would trim other programs.
   ``I'm afraid of an increase in inflation and, therefore, we will
see to it that the budget will not grow,'' Peres said on Israel
television.
   He said the plan would target ``development towns'' most
affected by unemployment.
   Israel began creating development towns in the 1950s to house
Jewish immigrants, mostly from North African and Middle East
countries.
   ``The whole program stresses the development towns problems in
at least three fields: Infrastructure of roads, water systems and
schools,'' Peres said.
   Moshe Nissim, former finance minister, said the plan ``would not
really help to ease unemployment,'' and he called for a more
comprehensive economic plan.

   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno today announced that he
would resign after his scandal-plagued party suffered a stinging
electoral defeat _ losing control of a house of parliament for the
first time in its 34 years.
   The long-governing Liberal Democrats had seen their popularity
plummet over the Recruit influence-peddling scandal, a new 3
percent sales tax and the liberalization of agricultural imports,
which farmers say hurts their livelihood.
   Uno, who has been prime minister for less than two months, said
his party's loss of control of parliament's upper house in Sunday's
balloting was ultimately his responsibility.
   ``It was a very difficult election,'' he told a nationally

   Mexico and its creditor banks finally agreed
on the key points of a debt-reduction package, providing the first
victory for the Bush administration's effort to ease the $1.3
trillion Third World debt burden.
   The agreement announced late Sunday night ended two days of
intense talks at the U.S. Treasury Department where Mexican
officials and U.S. bankers were joined by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   In the final package, negotiators representing the commercial
banks agreed to choose from three options for providing assistance.
They can cut the principal on the old loans by 35 percent, reduce
the interest rate they are charging to 6.25 percent or provide new
loans to Mexico.
   U.S. officials predicted that the debt-relief package could
slash by up to one-third the $4.5 billion Mexico is paying annually
to service the $54 billion it owes to commercial banks.

   With U.S. officials remaining tight-lipped
about the investigation of a top diplomat suspected of passing
information to the Soviets, the emerging picture is one of a
frustrated bureaucrat who may have aroused intelligence doubts a
decade ago.
   Administration, legislative and law enforcement officials
skirted questions Sunday about the probe of Felix S. Bloch, the
former second-in-command at the U.S. Embassy in Austria for seven
years.
   Bloch is the target of an intelligence probe, making him the
highest-ranking U.S. official ever implicated in an espionage

   Americans by nearly a 2-1 margin are inclined to
oppose anti-abortion candidates for their state legislatures and to
support legal abortion in their states, a national poll has found.
   As lawmakers across the country prepare to take up new abortion
laws, 38 percent of respondents to the Media General-Associated
Press poll said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate
who firmly opposes abortion.
   The same number said abortion wouldn't matter much in their
vote, while the smallest group _ about two in 10 _ said they would
be more apt to vote for a candidate who took a strong anti-abortion
position.
   Moreover, 63 percent of the 1,163 adults polled said they would
want abortion to be legal in their state if the U.S. Supreme Court
reversed its 1973 ruling that made abortion a constitutional right
and let each state make its own abortion laws.

   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's wily
Parliament speaker, is so confident he will be elected the Islamic
Republic's fourth president that he isn't even campaigning.
   ``People don't expect me to put up posters and photos,'' the
55-year-old cleric was quoted as telling the Tehran daily newspaper
Jomhuri Islami.
   Polls published by some newspapers indicate that when Iranians
cast ballots on Friday, Rafsanjani will win 86 percent of the vote.
   They give his only challenger, Abbas Sheibani, a colorless
former agriculture minister, a paltry 11 percent. Three percent of
Iranians questioned said they would not vote.

<HEAD>House Republicans Claim Reform Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican campaign warriors in the House are
trying to open a second front in their bid to cut the clout of
incumbents, hoping that voter cynicism about Congress itself will
work against Democrats in 1990.
   Demanding campaign finance reforms that would undo some of the
advantages incumbents enjoy when they seek re-election, Rep. Newt
Gingrich, the GOP whip, and his deputies say they are not going to
settle for less than a full overhaul of campaign and ethics laws
just to get an agreement with the Democratic majority.
   Since the parties don't and probably won't agree on what to do
and exactly how to go about it, that makes Democratic support
unlikely. That would make legislation improbable if not impossible,
leading to phase two of the GOP battle plan, which is to try to
identify Republicans with reform, and to make that a major national
issue in the 1990 congressional campaign.
   There are certain flaws in the plan.
   One is that the top Democrat in the House, Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, is publicly committed to action this year on ethics and
campaign reform. That hardly gives the Republicans a bye on the
issue.
   But Gingrich contends that what the Democrats would do is not
adequate, and would be more public relations than real reform.
   Then, too, the GOP is not without its own problems on ethics and
reform. A Republican administration produced improprieties and
influence peddling in federal housing programs, now under
congressional investigation. In addition, Gingrich himself faces a
possible investigation by the House ethics committee in connection
with a 1984 book promotion deal.
   Gingrich, who lodged the ethics charges that led to the downfall
of House Speaker Jim Wright, said the accusations against him are
baseless. He called them ``an attack on me for blowing the whistle
on Jim Wright.''
   He said neither party had the franchise for HUD scandals.
   But testimony about influence peddling by big-name Republicans
can hardly be helpful in a GOP quest for the reform mantle in the
next campaign.
   ``We still believe that the issue of reform is our issue,'' said
Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., who serves on a bipartisan House task
force that is considering campaign finance and ethics reforms.
Gunderson said surveys reflecting widespread mistrust of Congress
as an institution are an indication that incumbency could carry
liabilities in 1990.
   In a House controlled by Democrats, 257 to 175, with three
vacancies, the GOP theory is that the majority suffers most.
   That theory will get preview tests this summer in special
elections to fill the seats left open by the death of Rep. Claude
Pepper of Florida, and by the resignations of Wright and Rep. Tony
Coelho of California, the Democratic whip.
   The real push for position on the reform issue will come later.
   Foley has said he will press the reform quest after leaders of
both parties get the recommendations of the special task force.
   But those recommendations won't mean much if there is partisan
stalemate on major campaign finance questions. While Gingrich
contends that ``any real reform hurts the Democratic Party,'' the
GOP whip and his deputies do not sound as though they would be
dismayed to have an issue rather than a bill.
   Their tactics illustrate a generation gap among House
Republicans. The old GOP school was one of negotiation and
compromise with the controlling Democrats. That's the only way a
chronic minority can shape legislation.
   Gingrich contends that his more confrontational style is the way
out of minority status, toward capturing the control Republicans
have not had in 35 years.
   ``The Democratic Party is the party of the entrenched
incumbent,'' he said at a luncheon with reporters and deputy GOP
whips. ``... It is truly dangerous for the country to have this
kind of incumbency advantage.'' Gingrich said real reform
legislation will change that, and Republicans will not make a deal
for anything less.
   Gingrich rejected any partial approach to reform, arguing that
the Democrats could use that to defuse the ethics issue in the 1990
campaign. ``We're not going to give them an inexpensive ticket to
masquerade behind,'' he said.
   He said that unless there is fundamental reform in Congress,
President Bush should veto the legislative appropriations bill that
provides funds to the House and Senate. That wouldn't settle
anything, but it certainly would fuel the debate on reform as a
Congress heads into the 1990 campaign season.
   And that fits the GOP game plan.
   ``The Democrats are conceding the issue to us,'' Gunderson said.

   Arthur and Marion Vassmer ordered a shipment
of Woodstock key chains and cigarette lighters for their general
store in plenty of time for any crowds this year.
   It's what they didn't order 20 years ago this summer that still
causes a few pangs of regret.
   The shelves of their country store were nearly stripped bare
that August 15-17 when about a half million youngsters camped out
nearly two miles away at the Woodstock music festival.
   For one long weekend Vassmer's, open since 1911 on the shores of
White Lake to serve residents of this 6,000-population town,
operated like an exclusive nightclub. Bouncers stood at the front
door and let customers in a few dozen at a time to shop.
   ``If I'd known, I would have had 50 cases of peanut butter up
front and said, `there you go, take all you want,''' said Arthur
Vassmer.
   The Vassmers never made it up to Yasgur's farm during the
Woodstock festival in 1969 when flower children frolicked in the
mud and listened to The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Santana and others. They
were too busy.
   But they could hear the music wafting through the air at all
hours of the day and night. ``I didn't believe it would come off,''
Marion Vassmer said, ``and I still don't believe it was here.''
   The Vassmers remember kids abandoning their cars in town late
Thursday night, sitting on hoods and playing guitars and camping
out in the streets and nearby fields at night.
   Vassmer's, the closest store to the festival site, hadn't even
ordered any extra provisions. All of their canned goods were prized
items, along with the peanut butter. Despite the crowds, Arthur
said he doesn't remember any shoplifters and none of the 25 checks
he cashed bounced.
   ``They didn't bother anybody,'' Marion said. ``They were no
problem. I'm sure a lot of them were on drugs, but they helped each
other out. If one kid didn't have enough money, someone else would
give him some.''
   Arthur Vassmer said he dropped about 12 pounds over three days,
mostly because he couldn't bear to turn on his light and cook
something in his apartment above the store with so many hungry kids
on the street below.
   The couple love reminiscing about the festival with visitors,
but they know enough not to bring up the name ``Woodstock'' to
longtime Bethel residents.
   ``It's not a good topic for conversation because people who were
against it, they still feel the same way they did then,'' said
Marion Vassmer.
   Bethel and the surrounding Catskill Mountain region has let it
be known they're not particularly sentimental for the 20th
anniversary. Bethel refused offers from promoters to be host to an
anniversary concert, even when businessmen dangled enticements such
as paying for a new town sewer system.
   Town officials are expecting several thousand people to show up
at the former Yasgur farm for the anniversary.
   The concert was originally planned for the town of Woodstock,
about 50 miles away, but moved when promoters couldn't get
permission to hold it. At Woodstock today, cynical store owners
sell T-shirts with a map of the area making clear the festival took
place in Bethel, not in the famous arts colony.
   The Vassmers are part of a contingent of Bethel residents who
wish the town could cash in on its place in history by more
actively seeking tourists, but anti-festival opinion has held sway.
   Arthur Vassmer said some people still wander into the general
store and recognize him from the movie ``Woodstock,'' in which he
was interviewed. Some even ask for autographs, which still leaves
him tickled. His store, with the worn wooden floorboards, hasn't
changed much since 1969.
   Times have, though, and that's why he can't see a repeat
performance of Woodstock.
   ``Today you couldn't do it,'' he said. ``It's a different
attitude. These people were the peace people. They came up here for
love and peace and music and that's what they got.''

   Although much has been made of the Woodstock
generation's aging, the heroes of the festival are for the most
part doing now what they did then.
   In the order they appear on a monument at Yasgur's farm, here's
who are and what became of them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Richie Havens: Still performing, still an activist. Currently
on a 20th anniversary tour with several other Woodstock veterans.
   _ Arlo Guthrie: The son of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie
is still performing.
   _ Joan Baez: Her activist work continues unabated. She appeared
at Live Aid. In 1987, she released her memoirs ``And a Voice to
Sing With,'' and a new album, ``Recently.''
   _ Joe Cocker: His career took off after Woodstock. Still
performing; nominated for an Academy Award in 1983 for ``Up Where
We Belong,'' his duet with Jennifer Warnes for the movie, ``An
Officer and a Gentleman.''
   _ Ravi Shankar: The sitar player who introduced George Harrison
to Eastern music is still performing. He is 69.
   _ Janis Joplin: Died on Oct. 4, 1970, of a drug overdose. She
was 27.
   _ Jimi Hendrix: Died on Sept. 18, 1970, of a drug overdose. He
was 27.
   _ Johnny Winter: The original (and only) albino blues guitarist
enjoyed his greatest success after Woodstock; still playing.
   _ Creedence Clearwater Revival: Broke up in October 1972. Lead
singer John Fogerty's latest solo release was 1986's ``Eye of the
Zombie.''
   _ Mountain: Split in 1972. Guitarist Leslie West released a solo
album last year; bassist Felix Pappalardi was shot and killed by
his wife in April 1983.
   _ Santana: The band has flourished for two decades with a
variety of line-ups. A Carlos Santana retrospective, titled ``Viva
Santana!,'' was released last year.
   _ John Sebastian: Also on the 20th anniversary tour. His last
hit was 1976's theme for ``Welcome Back, Kotter;'' his name is
misspelled on the Woodstock memorial plaque as ``Sabastian.''
   _ The Who: Singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend and
bassist John Entwistle are on a 25th anniversary tour, ending a
seven-year layoff. Drummer Keith Moon died of an overdose on Sept.
7, 1978. He was 32.
   _ Canned Heat: Broke up in 1976. Two of its founders died:
guitarist Al ``Blind Owl'' Wilson on Sept. 3, 1970, and vocalist
Bob ``The Bear'' Hite of a drug-related heart attack in April 1981.
   _ The Grateful Dead: Touring again this summer. A new album is
due in September from the band, which has repeatedly called its
Woodstock performance mediocre. Keyboardist Ron ``Pigpen'' McKernan
died of a liver ailment in May 1973. He was 27.
   _ Paul Butterfield Blues Band: The pioneering white blues band
started the blues explosion of the 1960s and broke up in 1972.
Butterfield died on May 5, 1987, of a drug overdose. He was 44.
   _ Sly and the Family Stone: Despite a brilliant Woodstock set,
the group's success was short-lived; by 1973, their heyday was
over. Leader Sylvester Stewart has been plagued by drug problems
and last released an album in 1983.
   _ The Jefferson Airplane: After years of in-fighting, personnel
switches, lawsuits and a divorce, the Airplane reformed this summer
with original members Grace Slick, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady,
Paul Kantner and Marty Balin.
   _ The Band: The only act whose members lived in Woodstock. They
disbanded after ``The Last Waltz'' in 1976. Pianist Richard Manuel
committed suicide on March 4, 1986; its other members are still
performing.
   _ Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young: Reunited last year for
``American Dream,'' their first studio album since 1971's ``Deja
Vu.'' All four continue to perform separately and together. Crosby
detailed his drug addiction last year in a best-selling
autobiography, ``Long Time Gone.''
   _ Blood, Sweat and Tears: Their string of hits ended abruptly in
1971. They have continued to play, with and without vocalist David
Clayton Thomas.
   _ Melanie: Her career slowed down after such early '70s hits as
``Brand New Key.'' Also on the 20th anniversary tour, and has an
album due out this year.
   _ Ten Years After: Guitarist-vocalist Alvin Lee's band
dissembled in May 1975. Reunited this year with new LP, ``About
Time,'' their first in 15 years. During split, Lee has been
performing, while bassist Leo Lyons, keyboardist Chick Churchill
and drummer Rick Lee have stayed in music, producing, engineering
and managing. Last summer a German promoter offered to hire Ten
Years After for four festivals.
   _ Sweetwater: The Los Angeles group released three albums and
broke up in 1971. Lead singer Nancy Nevins de Johgh is now a
short-story writer.
   _ Sha-Na-Na: The '50s revival band has enjoyed continued success
(including a brief network television show) since Woodstock. Their
tour schedule includes shows in Las Vegas.
   _ The Incredible String Band: The Scottish group mixed Indian
music with rock 'n' roll. They split in the mid-'70s, although
co-leader Bruce Williamson still performs in Los Angeles.
   _ Country Joe and the Fish: The stars of the Woodstock movie and
soundtrack album split after the festival. Country Joe McDonald is
on the 20th anniversary tour.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Jean Shiner has been blind from birth. Her
husband, Franklin, can see a little but is legally blind. You'd
figure that bringing up two lively, normal daughters, aged 3 and 5,
would prove an overwhelming burden. Read on.

   Now and then when her daughters were
babies, Jean Shiner would wander the landscapes of their bodies
with her hands. ``I could feel them and know exactly who had a
short nose and who had long fingers. It was neat.''
   Now Esther is 5 and Judy 3, too big to sit still for such
things. But the memory came back recently as Jean applied calamine
lotion.
   The actual location of their chicken pox rash eluded her, but
``I just put it all over them. That way, I figured I'd hit it.''
   Which pretty much sums up the common sense, humor and love Jean
Shiner brings to raising two children she cannot see.
   She's been blind all her life, but that never stopped her from
learning to bicycle, ski or sail. It never stopped her from going
to college, graduating with honors or earning a master's degree.
   Nor did it stop her from falling in love, with a deep-voiced,
articulate man eight years her senior.
   At the Perkins School for the Blind outside Boston, where Jean
boarded from age 5, ``you were encouraged to date sighted guys.''
   ``We had socials. They would bring in sighted kids, but then
you'd never see them again. The idea was you should marry someone
with a pair of eyes to drive you around and read to you and take
care of you.''
   Jean married Franklin Shiner, legally blind from birth. Which
pretty much sums up her attitude about being cared for.
   The Shiners' snug, red-shingled house has an ambiance any parent
can appreciate, from the crunch of a stray Cheerio in the kitchen
to the deflating balloons strewn about the living room, stragglers
from Judy's birthday party. Counting the Shiner kids, the guest
list numbered nine.
   Outside is the timeless small-town summer symphony of chattering
children, barking dogs and hissing lawn sprinklers, punctuated by
slamming screen doors.
   Each time the Shiners' door opens, a bell rings. ``On the first
warm day of the year, when we all opened our doors for the first
time, Judy kept running out,'' Jean explains.
   Today, there's also the steady drone of the TV in the Shiner
living room, a rare concession to chicken pox by a mother faced
with entertaining two house-bound kids, a visitor, and a bored
German shepherd.
   She serves coffee to the visitor, cheese puffs and juice to the
girls, then pours herself a cup of tea and sinks into a kitchen
chair.
   Frank Shiner has already strapped on his backpack and set off
for Montpelier's lone supermarket, a two-mile round trip he makes
every other day. Jean likes to cook and has a well-stocked freezer,
with a braille map.
   On a normal day, Esther and Judy would be outdoors by now,
riding bikes, blowing bubbles or playing with other kids. Lunch is
a prelude to ``quiet time,'' followed by outings to the pool or the
library with Seltzer the guide dog in the lead. Jean grips
Seltzer's harness and Esther pushes Judy's stroller, a formation
perfected over time.
   ``Esther will help me report stores as we walk downtown, if I go
past where I wanted to go,'' says Jean, 36, a slender woman with
youthful good looks and a friendly, confident manner.
   Other animals tend to be Seltzer's downfall, and ``Esther has
learned to spot them a block away. She'll yell `I see a dog! I see
a cat!'
   ``Probably 10 years from now I'll look back and say `How did I
do it?''' For the time being, however, Jean would much rather be
called ``ordinary'' than ``amazing,'' as in, ``Isn't she amazing?
She can walk down the street with her kids and her dog!''
   Esther and Judy find Jean and Frank every bit as ordinary as
most small children regard their parents. ``Mommy is blind and she
can't see and Daddy is blind and he can see a little,'' Esther
explains, in the slightly exasperated voice of big sisters
everywhere. The interview ends abruptly, as the subject loses
interest and wanders back to ``Sesame Street.''
   Esther, immaculate in Oshkosh overalls, is the studious one,
with thoughtful dark eyes, a neat cap of brown hair and dimples
like her mother's. Judy's a disheveled escape artist, hazel-eyed,
round-faced and rambunctious.
   Both girls report each other's mischief except in cases of
conspiracy, as when, in the interest of science, they snuck a
little extra baking powder into their mother's cookie dough. ``They
were really yucky,'' Jean says cheerfully. ``We ate them anyway.''
   In the living room, the sound of crunching cheese puffs stops
abruptly, and Esther pipes up right on cue.
   ``Judy's stuffing her cheeks, Mommy.''
   ``Don't stuff your cheeks, Judy.''
   Jean relies on a combination of intuition and hearing to tell
her when her kids are up to something. Like most mothers, she's
seldom wrong.
   ``They get sat in the chair when I think they're doing
something.'' The most common chair-sitting offense at the moment:
``Looking out the window at neighbors who don't go to bed when they
do.''
   Esther wanders into the kitchen scrunching a brown paper bag.
``Sometimes I do this to bags,'' she says solemnly, then dissolves
into giggles as her mother swoops down and scoops her up in a hug.
``Sometimes I do this to little girls,'' Jean tells her.

   Time to color. Esther and Judy sit at the table while Jean
fetches their coloring books and crayons, stored, along with
puzzles, games and cards, in separate bags in her bedroom closet.
   The kids' clothes are neatly folded in their dressers. Jean pins
the shirts and pants together before she washes them, to keep her
girls color- coordinated.
   As the girls grow, so does the Shiners' library. ``I spend half
my time figuring out how to get books,'' Jean says. ``I'm really
envious of mothers in the library who can just pick up any book and
read it to their kids.''
   She also envies parents who can follow the puppet shows, finger
plays and craft demonstrations at play groups and story hours.
``Group situations are real hard. Everyone can look at the teacher
and I can't.''
   Jean uses a leash to keep track of Judy in the pool during
swimming lessons. ``Esther is more compliant, but we talk to Judy a
lot about boundaries. She'd wind up in East Calais if we didn't.''
Plans for a new fence in the back yard attest to the wanderlust of
the youngest Shiner.
   Lunchtime. Jean fixes tuna sandwiches, scraping carrots to serve
on the side. Everything has its place in her kitchen _ pots, pans,
utensils. Temperature settings on her oven dials are specially
marked, as are the microwave and egg timer. Spices are labeled in
braille.
   Joining hands for grace is a Shiner ritual. So is the story hour
that follows the meal. The girls cuddle next to Jean on the sofa.
Seltzer's tail thumps the carpet as she curls up at their feet.
   ``A guide dog is like another child,'' says Jean, who rises
early to put the big shepherd through her paces. ``Her training is
very intensive and I have to keep up with it.'' Boredom is an
occupational hazard for a dog trained in big-city traffic, then
assigned to Vermont.
   Jean is skilled at using a cane, but ``a cane is an extension of
your hand. For half the year in Vermont, all your landmarks are
covered up. A dog is a living partner.'' At the Shiners', she's
also a pet.
   For the next half-hour, Jean reads Bible stories to Judy. Esther
has her own copy of the book and follows along, mouthing the words,
her fingers brushing the print as her mother's skim over the
braille.
   Frank returns from the market, laden with provisions. ``I'm
putting the girls' shampoo under the sink,'' he calls. ``Where's
lunch?''
   ``On the counter, to the right of the sink.''
   The story continues, followed by a token attempt at a nap.
Finally, Jean relents: The girls may play quietly in the yard.
   Raising two children without benefit of one's sight might seem
overwhelming to some people, but Jean says it never really fazed
her much. ``We worried some, but we tend to face problems as they
come up, one day at a time, one stage at a time.
   ``If I could see, I'd have to figure out from scratch how to be
a sighted person. I'm used to listening, to using my other senses.
If I could see for a day, I'd like to see what colors look like,
what a sunset looks like. Then I would give it up.''
   Jean's blindness was caused by too much oxygen given her and her
twin sister Joan following their premature birth. Some of Joan's
sight was saved, since she was slightly bigger and was removed from
the isolette first. Jean suffered optic nerve damage and sees only
darkness.
   Nevertheless, as a child growing up in Framingham, Mass., ``Jean
didn't miss out on anything,'' says her mother, Helen Harbberts.
``If Joan got a coloring book and crayons, Jean got a coloring book
and crayons. When Joan got a two-wheeler, Jeannie did too.''
   Dorothy Shiner, Frank's mother, thinks the anti-nausea medicine
she took during pregnancy may have caused her son's blindness. Two
months after his birth, her sighted husband abandoned the family.
   Mrs. Shiner, who also is blind, earned a living managing a snack
bar in a Vermont state office building. Mainstreaming had not yet
been envisioned, but ``Frank was allowed to do whatever the other
kids did. I brought him up to be independent.''
   It never occurred to Jean and Frank not to have children, though
Jean waited until she was pregnant to tell her mother. Both
families shared the new parents' joy and relief when Esther and
Judy were born fully sighted.
   Jean quit her job counseling disabled people to be a full-time
mother, and Frank took paternity leave from his job producing a
radio show for the Governor's Committee on Employment of the
Handicapped. A public health nurse supervised Esther's first bath
and feeding, but then the Shiners were on their own.
   Despite all the baby books Jean studied during pregnancy, ``I
discovered that I didn't know anything about raising a child before
I had one _ and neither did a lot of sighted people.''
   For all its joys, parenthood is also a time of great
vulnerability for the Shiners. Because they walk everywhere they
go, Jean keeps the girls indoors when the temperature drops below
zero. But otherwise, ``we are out there, visible, whatever the
weather,'' Frank says.
   ``Most people ride by in their cars and their kid is in a car
seat strapped into the back with the door locked and the window
rolled up.''
   Despite his communications degree and experience, steady work in
radio has eluded Frank during the 10 years since the state stopped
funding his show. ``In the past, I've sold myself short, working
just to say I have a job.''
   The Shiners get by on disability benefits, and Frank keeps busy
with various disability rights organizations, but he struggles with
the toll joblessness has taken on his confidence.
   Rather then take another ``survival'' job, he's chosen to help
raise his daughters until satisfying work comes along. ``I read
with them, I take time with them, I try to make the most of it.
It's an opportunity a lot of guys don't get.''
   For Jean, acceptance by other mothers is an ongoing struggle.
``They can put their kid in someone's car but they think twice
about letting me pick up their child. I'm always having to earn
their trust, to remind people: I'm blind, but I'm a person just
like you.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In vast Alaska, highways are scarce, villages
remote and cars have limited use. Get a horse? No, get an airplane.
Here's one man's crusade to honor the aviation pioneers in
America's flyingest state.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The remains of the airplane lay
rotting in the slimy thicket of a gulch, wings clipped, tail shorn,
body stove in, a sorry looking carcass guarded by squadrons of
bloodthirsty mosquitoes.
   To Ted Spencer it shone like a jewel.
   ``It can be restored,'' Spencer was saying, stalking the
remains, nodding. ``Yes, it can.'' His boots made sucking sounds as
he bounded around in the muck snapping pictures, oblivious to the
mosquitoes, his glee obvious.
   ``I heard about this airplane last year and didn't believe it
was true. When I came and saw it for myself, saw `Ptarmigan II'
painted on its nose, my heart leapt. Look, you can still read it.''
   Ted Spencer is the director of the Alaska Aviation Heritage
Museum which occupies a corner of the Anchorage airport.
   At 42, he couples a childlike exuberance for airplanes with a
professorial knowledge of them, especially airplanes of the
Ptarmigan II vintage.
   His aim is to document, through records and artifacts, one of
the most colorful periods in American history, the 20 years before
World War II when ``The Aviation,'' as it was called, came to
Alaska.
   The old airplanes themselves, of course, are the prime
artifacts. A proud array of them, restored to look like new,
contrast handsomely with their modern counterparts flying overhead.
   ``What those aviation pioneers did in Alaska was no less
extraordinary,'' says Spencer, ``than men landing on the moon. What
they accomplished had immediate effects, and they were more
significant in Alaska than the advent of aviation in any other
state. They liberated America's last frontier.''
   Flying out to Willow Creek recently _ there being no other way
to cover the 275 miles from Anchorage _ Spencer pointed out the
window to a beach on the Kuskokwim River near the village of
McGrath. As if to document his own claim, he scribbled a note to
his fellow passenger:
   ``Carl Ben Eielson flew first airmail to that spot Feb. 1924.
Single-engine DeHavilland DH-4. Open cockpit. Came from Fairbanks.
Three-hour flight in winter.''
   Before Eielson's flight it took 20 days to make that 300-mile
mail run by dog team. You can see a photograph of Eielson and his
airplane at the Heritage Museum.
   More out of continuing necessity than nostalgia for those glory
days of epic feats, Alaska has remained by far the flyingest state
in the nation.
   According to Federal Aviation Administration figures, Alaska,
per capita, has eight times as many pilots and 15 times as many
planes as the U.S. average. It works out to one pilot for every 55
Alaskans and one plane for every 57. Alaska's 9,682 licensed pilots
average 132 flying hours a year compared with a national average,
including Alaska, of 49 hours.
   Hood Lake in Anchorage is the world's largest seaplane base.
Merrill Field, which handles only general aviation _ light planes
for personal and charter use _ is busier than the international
airports in Seattle-Tacoma, Salt Lake City, and Orlando, Fla.
   ``It's hard for people who haven't experienced Alaska to
visualize its vastness and its terrain,'' said the FAA's Paul
Steuke.
   ``We have only about 533,000 people, most of them scattered in
settlements that would be utterly isolated without the airplane.
Our few roads, very few, are like streams without tributaries, you
can't get to them. Even if you could, they're often impassable in
winter.
   ``Add to that four huge mountain ranges and unpredictable
weather systems boiling out of the Pacific. Even skilled pilots
have to stay on their toes in Alaska.''
   How much more so, says Spencer, for the aviation pioneers who
established that almost mythic breed known as bush pilots. During
the 1920s and 1930s they became the most popular and honored men in
Alaska.

   ``Imagine flying out over uncharted territory through narrow
mountain passes in open cockpits with no maps, no weather reports,
no radios, no landing strips, no places to refuel.''
   Eskimos saw airplanes long before they saw automobiles and came
to regard the pilots as paracletes. They brought medicine to the
villages, fresh fruit, locations of caribou herds, news of
relatives in other settlements.
   They took trappers into the bush and came back on appointed days
to fetch them. They hauled miners and supplies to gold camps,
hauled the sick to hospitals.
   A pilot named Leo Moore hauled a cow from Anchorage so an ailing
baby in McGrath could have fresh milk. A pilot named Sig Wien
hauled a chessboard on his 90-mile trips between Point Lay and
Wainwright so two distant friends could have a game.
   By 1939, Alaska's small airplanes and hearty pilots were hauling
23 times as many passengers per capita as the airlines of the
United States and 1,000 times as much freight.
   Empty wooden boxes labeled Stanavo Gas, each of which held two
five-gallon cans of airplane fuel, littered the countryside.
Stacked in outposts and trapper's cabins, they came to be known as
Alaska cupboards.
   On a stopover at Flat on the way to Willow Creek, Spencer found
a Stanavo box in good shape and brought it back with him.
   ``If I don't find things like this myself they might not be
found,'' he said. ``We don't have much help and the museum is
practically broke. We're in a constant financial crisis.''
   John Miscovich, who is 71, was born in a mining camp at Flat,
about eight miles from Willow Creek, and remembers when The
Aviation reached there. ``It opened up a whole new era.''
   He also remembers when Wiley Post crash-landed there in 1933 _
safely, but it was a close call. Spencer videotaped Miscovich's
recollection of the episode.
   It was Miscovich who told Ted Spencer about the abandoned
remains of the plane at Willow Creek, how the pilot had salvaged
the plane's engines after a crash and left the rest. The boxy
fuselage, Miscovich said, had for a time served as a makeshift
toolshed before it finally wound up in the gulch.
   Spencer has in his museum files the history of very nearly every
bush plane the pioneer airmen flew.
   ``I knew the Ptarmigan II was a Ford Tri-Motor, probably the
first in Alaska. In fact, I had a picture of it, and of its pilot,
Frank Dorbandt.
   ``Dorbandt bought it from an air service in the States which had
named it West Wind II. It was built in 1928. Dorbandt bought it in
1934, brought it to Alaska and renamed it Ptarmigan II. There never
was a Ptarmigan I.
   ``Dorbandt was one of the really early pilots. He participated
in the search for Eielson.''
   Eielson, at age 32, had crashed in a storm over Siberia. His
fellow bush pilots mounted a search and one of them, Joe Crosson,
found the wreckage and Eielson's body weeks later. Soviet airmen
had also joined in the search and a Soviet ship returned the body
to Alaska, wrapped in an American flag sewn from red and blue
muslin and white ship canvas.
   Beginning with Eielson's crash in 1930, fully two-thirds of the
planes in Alaska were wrecked beyond repair over the next 10 years.
Less serious crackups were commonplace. In fact, pilots came to
expect some minor damage on every landing.
   ``But they persevered,'' Spencer says. ``As a result we now have
a fairly intricate network of air travel that unifies the whole
state.''
   Spencer has arranged with the National Guard to fly out in a
helicopter the first week in September and lift the remains of
Ptarmigan II from the gulch at Willow Creek.
   It will join its brothers in that panoply of history, each in
flying condition, each with its own contribution to a storied era
that opened up a hostile land.
   ``Ptarmigan II will have a place of honor,'' Spencer says. ``It
will fly again.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Shortly after they arrived at the remote valley
in Colorado called the Baca, a local mountain man and ``prophet''
came down to visit Maurice and Hanne Strong. He told them they were
on sacred ground where all the world's religions would gather to
work for greater spiritual understanding. Today the Strong's are
working to fulfill that prophecy.

   Hanne Strong unrolls her blueprint of a
``global village'' for spiritual leaders and environmentalists and
pins its corners down on her kitchen table with an expensive tea
set.
   It shows a band of temples and churches, gardens, and small,
self-sufficient communities laid out along the foot of the Sangre
de Cristo mountains here.
   Some of what's in the plan already has been realized, some is in
the works, and some exists just in ``prophecy,'' Strong says.
   Like Strong, who travels the area's back roads in skirts and
silk blouses as comfortably as in jeans, the plan is at once earthy
and elegant, serious and a little spacey, embracing the
disadvantaged one minute and industrial magnates and movie stars
the next.
   ``Unenlightened, confused minds are ruling the world and
destroying the environment,'' Strong says. ``There needs to be a
major shift in the way people think.''
   Strong and her husband, Canadian oil developer and United
Nations diplomat Maurice Strong, hope to turn several thousand
acres of desert and mountains in southern Colorado's San Luis
Valley into a repository of spiritual truth and environmentally
sound living _ a place where political and business leaders can
come to be taught how to care for themselves and the Earth.
   They don't want a lot of people, who would tax the area's
fragile natural balance.
   The place, originally part of the 160,000-acre Baca Spanish
land-grant ranch, is called just ``the Baca.'' Area Indians
believed it to be sacred, ``neutral'' ground where tribes could
come together. Hanne Strong believes it has kept that power intact.
   The Strongs already have given away hundreds of acres to
Carmelite Catholics, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Zen monks, American
Indian tribes and the yoga-based Sri Aurobindo Learning Center.
They have put up chapels, hermitages, temples, sweat lodges,
community buildings and gardens.
   On the blueprint, Hanne has set aside 2,000 more choice acres
for other religious groups she believes will come to the Baca
someday as earlier groups did _ on their own. She does not recruit.
   A native of Denmark who personally feels closest to the American
Indian spiritual tradition, Strong says she respects all
spirituality but intends the Baca to be for religions with ``an
unbroken lineage,'' not the so-called ``New Age'' groups.
   ``This is `Old Age,''' she says with a laugh. ``Very old.''
   The Strongs have sold land at the Baca to less-established
spiritual groups, although not yet to actress Shirley MacLaine, a
friend of Strong's who visits the Baca often and wants to set up a
spiritual community here.
   One such group that bought land at the Baca is the Haidakhandi
Ashram, which is building a Vedic temple and small community on 46
acres to follow the teachings of Haidakhan Babaji, a Hindu mystic.
   Other projects under way include an Experimental Garden and Seed
Bank for high-altitude crops, an educational center for American
Indian youth, a world nutritional center and various healing
centers.
   Scattered among the spiritual groups and projects are about 100
homes, the beginnings of the Baca Grande retirement community that
was cut short when the Strongs came to the area in 1979.
   Most of the Baca development remains a virtual wilderness, where
a visitor sees more deer than people, and signs of mountain lion
and bear.
   ``It's a complete ecosystem,'' Strong says. ``It's still in a
pure state.''
   The Baca, elevation 7,800 feet, can only be reached from the
west. To the east rises a wall of craggy, snow-covered peaks rising
to more than 14,000 feet, the Sangre de Cristos.
   Compared to the arid valley a traveler crosses to get here, much
of the Baca is lush, traversed by creeks and shaded by tall trees.
   Some of the spiritual groups that have moved here actually were
directed to the Baca by Hopi Indian elders. Cree, Blackfoot, Ute
and Sioux tribes have built ceremonial lodges at the Baca, and
Navajos and Hopis make pilgrimages here.
   ``This is a sacred place, for hundreds, thousands of years,''
says Mike Sierra, a Lakota Sioux from the Pine Ridge reservation in
South Dakota, who travels to the Baca occasionally as an apprentice
to a Sioux medicine man. ``It's a place of power.''
   The area's beauty inspires all the spiritual groups that have
settled here.
   ``The desert and the mountains are deep religious symbols for
every spiritual community, and right at the heart of the Carmelite
philosophy,'' says Sister Sharon Doyle at the Carmelite monastery,
where the buildings blend into the landscape and are invisible from
a distance. ``Aesthetics are very important to us for creating a
contemplative climate...Beauty uplifts the soul. It's part of the
whole consciousness of this area _ respect or reverence for the
Earth.''
   The Carmelites, who moved to the Baca from Sedona, Ariz., in
1983 because of encroaching development, have 104 acres, including
a mountain hermitage. Nine full-time hermits _ both men and women _
live at the Baca, and their numbers are growing. The order is
negotiating to buy more property and has a waiting list of
retreatants.
   The Baca is bordered on the north by Crestone, a tiny
gold-mining town gone bust, and on the south by the Great Sand
Dunes National Monument. To the west is the Baca Grant Ranch, with
more than 4,500 head of cattle. Maurice Strong is the ranch's board
chairman.
   Crestone is an hour from the nearest supermarket, in Alamosa,
and half a day's drive from Denver, northeast over a couple of
mountain ranges.
   Crestone's post office was about to close in the early 1970s
when the subdivision came along, followed several years later by
the Strongs. Now about 200 people live in the town and adjoining
development year-round, 300 in the summer.
   Residents include ranch hands and a handful of old-timers as
well as retirees and those attracted either by the spiritual groups
or by the chance to live in a small town with an international
flavor.
   The tiny Crestone phone book is riddled with such entries as
``Crystal Sojourns'' and ``Ahimsa Lifestyle.''
   It also includes some of the rich and famous the Strongs have
brought to the area, including Robert O. Anderson, former chairman
of Atlantic Richfield, and Najeeb E. Halaby, former head of Pan
American Airlines and father of the queen of Jordan.

   Halaby has built a home and ziggurat _ an ancient type of
Assyrian temple _ on land he bought from the Strongs near the Sand
Dunes.
   It is one tract in an area the Strongs divided into several
tracts and allowed the non-denominational Lindisfarne Association
to sell to wealthy friends and acquaintances. One of them, Aziz Al
Hamdan of Kuwait, is inviting hundreds of family members to set up
a bedouin camp on his land, Strong says.
   Maurice Strong, the first chief of the United Nations
Environment Program _among other environmental credentials _ sees
the Baca as an attempt ``to harmonize the people who affect the
environment, who are the economic practitioners.''
   The Strongs first came to the Baca in 1978 when Maurice took
control of AZL Resources Inc., which owned the 146,000-acre Baca
Grant Ranch and the 14,000-acre Baca Grande Development, on which
AZL had tried unsuccessfully since 1971 to develop a retirement
resort.
   They were struck by the area's beauty and halted the retirement
development.
   Under Strong, AZL began consolidating tracts of land, giving
some to spiritual groups and selling some. The company merged with
Los Angeles-based Tosco in 1983, and Tosco sold the Baca in 1986 to
a group of investors led by Strong.
   Other investors include former U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency chief William Ruckelshaus; Canadian financier Sam Belzberg;
Anderson and his son Robert B. Anderson, and others.
   That group still owns the ranch, but sold the development in
1987 to local developers.
   The Strongs own 20 percent of the ranch, and Hanne Strong has
her 2,000 ``key acres'' along the mountains in a foundation called
Manitou.
   In 1981, the Aspen Institute set up a conference center,
complete with restaurant, town houses and jogging trail, on 320
acres donated by the Strongs and AZL.
   The remoteness of the area prompted the institute to discontinue
its programs there in 1984, but now Colorado College, located 130
miles away in Colorado Springs, leases some of the town houses as a
field school and dormitories.
   The Strongs, who are building a new solar-energy home, own one
of the town houses in which Hanne lives most of the year.
   The prophecy Hanne Strong follows is chiefly that of Glen
Anderson, a local mountain man and ``prophet'' who came down into
the valley and visited the Strongs two months after they arrived at
the Baca.
   She says he told them they were on sacred ground where all the
world's religions would gather to work for greater spiritual
understanding.
   ``He said, `That's what you're here for _ to do this,''' she
says. Anderson has since died.
   Strong asked elders from nine American Indian tribes to come to
the Baca and hold a council on the prophecy. After four days, she
said, ``They said the prophecy's correct.''
   Of all the projects under way at the Baca, Strong herself is
most excited about the fledgling RedSun Institute, an
``International Educational Center for Indigenous Peoples,'' and
the 200-acre Tibetan Center, along with the agricultural research.
   ``Many Indian elders have been coming to this area for a long
time,'' says RedSun director Pat Caverly, 38, who is seeking grants
to get the institute going.
   She sees it as ``a gathering place for the traditional teachings
to be passed on to the youth.''
   Initial projects include building a village where students can
come to learn about Indian spirituality and community development,
and creating a ``Sustainable Development Youth Corps'' dedicated to
restoring and protecting the Earth.
   Strong's ties to the Tibetans run deep. She says her grandson,
Jason Mayo, born in Alamosa in 1979, was recognized by the High
Lama in 1981 as the reincarnation of an 11th-century Tibetan saint
named Rechung Dorje Drakpa.
   Four Tibetan monks currently live at the Baca, planning the
construction of retreat centers, a monastery, a holistic medical
institute and a lay village for about 300 people.
   The San Luis Valley Tibetan Project began nearly a decade ago,
when followers of the Dalai Lama, refugees from the Chinese
invasion of Tibet in 1959, came to the Baca at Strong's invitation.
She says they vowed to bring their most sacred texts and artifacts
to the Baca, believing the Tibetan Buddhist tradition may perish in
the Himalayas under Chinese occupation.
   Ground will be broken this summer on the first three buildings
of the project, estimated to cost nearly $1 million. Money is being
raised through donations and pledges, Strong says.
   Altogether, only a couple of dozen people live permanently at
the Baca's spiritual communities, visited by numerous retreatants.
   Strong herself is reluctant to publicize the Baca.
   ``It's not ready yet,'' she says. ``I don't want this to be put
on the map as a kooky place.''
   But many of the spiritual groups depend on donations or
retreatants' fees to pay their way. They want the world to know
they are there.
   Two people live full-time at the 300-acre Zen Center, plus a
couple of non-denominational retreatants at any given time and
Roshi Richard Baker, who heads the group and spends about half the
week there.
   Baker took over operation of the mountain retreat center from
Lindisfarne, founded by New York writer William Thompson to study
religion and the humanities. With land donated by the Strongs,
Thompson lived there until illness caused him to return to New York
in 1983.
   Says Gerald Weischede, a West German native turned Zen monk and
director of the Crestone Mountain Zen Center: ``It's nice that
people at the Baca are more open for some kind of spirituality. The
decision to go into the desert more or less means you've decided to
support each other.''
   Once a week, the Baca's spiritual communities have a joint
silent-prayer meeting, open to the larger community as well.
   ``The Baca's a place where all the great traditions can find
nurture, not in isolation but in community,'' says Seyril Schochen,
director of the Sri Aurobindo center, dedicated to the teachings of
Sri Aurobindo, a Mahayogi of India who died in 1950.
   ``It's unity through diversity.''

   Hanne and Maurice Strong come off a
faster, more international track than just about anyone in Crestone.
   Maurice's early years sound like a Jack London story. Born in
Manitoba in 1929, he ran away at 13, after graduating from high
school five years early. He stowed away on a ship to Alaska where,
at 17, he became an apprentice fur trader.
   He soon started his own mining company and his business
interests proliferated. By age 23, he had made his first $1 million.
   Strong was the first head of the Canadian International
Development Agency, from 1966-70, and the first head of Petro
Canada, from 1976-78.
   But he soon began augmenting his business expertise with
environmental experience, and served as executive director of the
United Nations environmental program, based in Nairobi, in the
mid-1970s. In 1985, he was named executive coordinator of the
United Nations' African emergency relief operations.
   An unusual mix of capitalist-developer and, as The New York
Times called him in 1975, ``Custodian of the Planet,'' Maurice says
it is important to forge links between business and
environmentalism.
   ``I believe you have to be in the middle of these things,'' he
says. ``In our system, the market system, you affect the
environment, and the only way to affect the environment positively
is to make sure that you have environmental considerations built
right into your business.''
   When Maurice Strong first came to the Baca in 1978 after
acquiring an interest in AZL Resources, which owned it, he says he
knew he wanted to save it from routine development.
   ``We were attracted by the qualities that make it so special now
_ the beauty, the space, the fact that it's not a ski resort,'' he
says.
   Strong does want to develop the area's water, however, and he
and a group of investors currently are embroiled in a heated
dispute with valley water users over the investors' claim on what
they say is a huge, untapped aquifer.
   Valley residents are skeptical of Strong's claim that the valley
would benefit if his company sold the water to outside cities.
   Hanne Strong's interests stick closer to the Baca, and she says
she and Maurice complement each other.
   ``I'm the mystical one,'' she says. ``He's the manifester. He
gets things done.''
   She was born Hanne Marstrand in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1941.
Her father ran a fleet of salmon ships, and both her parents were
active in the resistance to the Nazis, she says.
   Born a Lutheran but raised Catholic, Hanne says she had mystical
experiences early on, including seeing angels.
   ``I knew from a very young age that I wasn't Danish, that I was
Indian,'' she says. ``And I knew that one day I would be with my
people.''
   After studying industrial and interior design in Denmark, she
moved to New York City in her early 20s and set up a design firm.
   In 1972, Hanne left her business and moved to Nairobi where she
had been hired to design the country's United Nations headquarters.
There she met Maurice Strong.
   The couple moved to Calgary, Alberta, in 1972, where Hanne
became involved in Indian political issues.
   When she first came to the Baca, she says, ``I knew I was home.''
   Hanne believes she and the Baca are creatures of both luck and
destiny.
   ``I like luck _ I feel I've got a lot of it,'' she says. ``But
far greater forces are at work and I know it will happen. It was
meant to be. We're just tools, and we have to perfect ourselves.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The free-trade agreement between the United
States and Canada has opened the floodgates to bargain hunters
crisscrossing the border at places like Sault Ste. Marie. But as
residents of the Michigan city and its sister city in Ontario have
learned, shoppers need to master ``border math.''

<DATELINE>SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign trade couldn't be much
freer than in the Twin Saults, the two cities with the same name
separated by the 2{-mile breadth of the St. Marys River and flying
different flags.
   Americans and Canadians go back and forth across the border in
droves to buy bread, have babies or drink beer, without a worry
about tariffs or quotas.
   ``We call it jumping across the big ditch,'' says Canadian steel
worker Richard Shurtliffe.
   On Wednesdays after work, Shurtliffe and his buddies hop the St.
Marys from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to the $1-a-beer bars in
Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. Canadian brew tastes better, but American
suds are cheaper, Shurtliffe says.
   Beer isn't the only bargain.
   Canada's dairy prices, for instance, are jacked up by a farm
support system that is unlikely to change even under the country's
free-trade agreements with the United States. No matter, Shurtliffe
says. He buys American.
   Not only does he buy U.S. milk for his grandchildren, he fills
his pickup truck with U.S. gasoline and his refrigerator with U.S.
steaks.
   Even Canadian cigarettes are cheaper in U.S. stores.
   ``It's an awful savings,'' Shurtliffe says. ``It seems
everything's cheaper in Michigan.''
   It's a commerce without national loyalty. In the Sault
(pronounce it soo), many American women have their American babies
in Canada and tourists buy their Canadian souvenirs in the United
States.
   The biggest traffic jams at Canada customs are at 2:30 a.m.,
when the U.S. bars close and Canadians go home.
   Customs agent Giacomo Pastore has seen the happy drivers line up
for as long as 45-minute waits at the border crossing into Canada.
   ``It's a ritual,'' Pastore says.
   ``It's an awful pile of Canadians,'' Shurtliffe says.
   Locals call them the Twin Saults or the Two Saults, but these
cities on opposite sides of the Soo shipping locks are anything but
identical.
   Historical markers on the U.S. side tell of the treaty taking
northern Michigan from the Chippewa Indians. A plaque on Canadian
soil remembers the shameful ``Chicoro Incident'' of 1870, when the
United States refused a Canadian military ship passage through the
U.S. locks. The Canadians had to walk around the St. Marys rapids.
   Sault, Ont., is six times the size of Sault, Mich. The Ontario
town of 83,000 has a steel mill, paper mill and a large shopping
mall. Its downtown Queen Street is dotted with upscale china shops.
   Sault, Ont., also has more movie theaters, a lower drinking age
and two strip clubs, says Michigan teen-ager Dean Newcomb.
   Michigan's Sault is a quiet home to 14,500 people, many of whom
don't lock their doors. Summer tourism is the major industry.
Winter snow is the biggest occurence. From a three-block drive of
kitsch shops, visitors can buy blue wind chimes from Taiwan and
T-shirts that say Canada.
   Canada?
   ``It's hard to buy a Canadian souvenir in their Sault,''
explains Bob Smith, owner of a block of such tourist emporiums as
Ships Ahoy, Captains Quarters and the Anchor and Seven Seas motels.
``This is where the tourists shop.''
   Since the signing of the free-trade pact between the two
countries, the easy commerce between the Saults has become even
freer and easier.
   ``It seems to have opened up the gate,'' says Patrick Shannon,
the Chippewa County prosecutor on the Michigan side. ``Trade hasn't
changed, but all of a sudden the Canadians have realized they can
go shopping on our side. Crossing the border isn't such an issue
anymore.''
   That's a problem. Law enforcement in Sault, Mich., used to be a
personal matter. You knew who was having a family fight and who was
driving home from the bar.
   With so many people crossing over these days, the town is full
of strangers. ``We don't know who we're dealing with anymore,''
Shannon says.
   Not all of the foreign trade is faring well.
   American insurance companies have put a crimp in the
once-booming business of delivering babies in Ontario. Ten years
ago, as many as 20 percent of the women patients of an Ontario
obstetrician, Dr. T. Orr, were Americans drawn by the
more-specialized services available in Ontario.
   Now, with U.S. Medicare and many insurance companies refusing to
pay for health care outside the United States, foreigners make up
only 8 percent of Orr's practice.
   Because the banks and bars, tourist centers and tollgates all
set their own exchange rates, commerce between the Saults can get
complicated. Those who cross frequently must master ``border math.''
   Shurtliffe's wife, Ruth, for example, can figure which is
cheaper: gasoline at 54 cents Canadian per liter or $1.21 American
per gallon. That is considering also that her Canadian dollar
currently buys only 80 cents American and she has to pay $1.50 to
drive across the International Bridge.
   It can get so confusing many businesses accept the other
country's currency, even if it isn't legal tender. A Canadian
dollar will buy as much beer at David Dear's Back Door bar as a
U.S. greenback.
   ``After all, we are the Twin Saults,'' Dear says. More than half
of his customers are Canadians.
   With the American dollar worth more at the moment, U.S.
residents forgetting to exchange their money for Canadian suffer a
double whammy. Not only do most Canadian businesses take U.S.
currency at the lower Canadian value, but Canadian prices often are
higher.
   ``There is an advantage of having the right money on the right
side at the right time,'' says Linda Sumner, a Michigan tourist
from Livonia.
   Grant Putman, a farmer from Williamston, Mich., got caught in a
Canadian restaurant with hungry kids and only U.S. cash in his
wallet. He paid American and bought his food for 15 percent more
than true cost.
   ``Of course, the waitress gave me my change in Canadian, so I
was out there, too,'' Putman said.
   ``I got even. I tipped her in Canadian.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Since it was abandoned in the 15th century as
the capital of a once-powerful Cambodian empire, Angkor has been
ravaged by weather and vegetation, thieves and vandals. During the
past 20 years of guerrilla fighting in the region, little has been
done to restore its ancient edifices. Now help is on the way, from
several corners of the world.

<TEXT>
   With the shadows of war receding from
ancient Angkor, the international community is mobilizing to rescue
from decay one of civilization's greatest artistic achievements.
   The Hindu and Buddhist edifices, dating from the ninth through
12th centuries, have been assaulted by jungle growth, monsoon rains
and thieves as armies clashed around them over the past two decades.
   India, the only non-communist nation to recognize the pro-Hanoi
government in Phnom Penh, is already restoring the colossal Angkor
Wat, the crowning jewel, but hundreds of other temples and
architectural relics from Cambodia's Golden Age remain untended.
   Security has been a major problem in recent years, with the
Khmer Rouge and other anti-government guerrillas within striking
distance of Angkor. And diplomatic isolation of the Phnom Penh
government has prevented most international assistance.
   While the guerrillas remain a potential threat, there is
optimism that a peaceful political solution may be reached
following the promised withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from
Cambodia in September.
   ``We are waiting for the first available opportunity to restore
the magnificent monuments,'' says Mahfuz Anam, regional spokesman
for the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
``UNESCO's director general is hopeful of a political solution.''
   Although it is restricted from working with the Phnom Penh
government, which the United Nations does not recognize, UNESCO
this spring quietly dispatched two experts for a preliminary,
on-site diagnosis of Angkor's ills.
   UNESCO may help organize an international symposium on Angkor
and eventually launch a worldwide fund-raising campaign such as
those which helped resurrect Egypt's pyramids, Indonesia's
Borobudur temple and the ancient north African city of Carthage.
   ``Everyone wants to get involved in Angkor,'' said one Western
aid official in Phnom Penh.
   Ung Von, who heads Cambodia's conservation effort here, says the
Poles will arrive late this year to begin work on the Bayon, an
intricate, 800-year-old shrine of mysterious galleries and 54 stone
towers sculpted with the faces of smiling dieties.
   The wondrous structure is currently looked after by two old
sweepers and guarded by two teen-age policemen. Its eastern gate
caved in like a deck of cards several years ago. Green algae and
white fungi mar its friezes of ancient battles and court life.
   The French, who hacked Angkor out of the jungle in the last
century and became its most expert overseers, refuse to provide
valuable archival material to Phnom Penh but have asked to restore
the 11th-century Baphuon, Ung Von says.
   The Indians are midway through their six-year, $1O million
project to renew Angkor Wat, a massive representation of the Hindu
cosmos in stone which rises in three successive flights to five
central towers that have become the symbol of Cambodia.
   The work by 13 Indians and more than 400 Cambodians has included
cleaning the friezes, dismantling and reassembling the gateways,
and the excavation of ditches to allow drainage of water within the
moat-girded complex.
   The work on Angkor Wat's nearly 1,440 square yards of friezes is
painstaking. Brushes are used to scrub off moss, insect nests and
clinging vegetation, the latter sometimes requiring injections of
weed killer in a syringe. Other chemicals are used to attack fungi,
micro-vegetable matter and corrosive bat droppings before a
protective coating is applied.
   Heavy machinery is limited to the occasional use of a borrowed
crane while obtaining construction supplies like cement is a
logistical nightmare. Work proceeds with the use of hands, hoes and
bamboo baskets, not unlike the way Angkor Wat was probably
constructed.
   Some old, expert craftsmen who had worked with the French have
returned but Ung Von says local expertise was decimated during the
Khmer Rouge rule and by lack of training since. Some also criticize
the Indians.
   ``They need our help,'' Ung Von says. ``Sometimes they don't
have the experience. They have done their job well but their
technique is different from the French.''
   Some Cambodians and Westerners say privately that the Indian
team uses inferior chemicals, is reassembling galleries in a way
that allows water seepage, and is stubbornly clinging to some
techniques abandoned by international leaders in conservation.
   But an expert, independent evaluation of their work has yet to
be made and the Cambodians are publicly reluctant to criticize
because they have made a major political issue of non-communist
India coming to their aid.
   The Indian restoration, which began in 1987, was the first
meaningful attempt to keep the rapid deterioration at bay since
French archaeologist Bernard-Phillipe Groslier was expelled from
Angkor by the Khmer Rouge in 1972.
   Angkor has fought against the elements since being abandoned in
the 15th century as the capital of a once-powerful Cambodian
empire. The Khmer Rouge occupied the area during their war against
the U.S.-backed government in Phnom Penh and did nothing to restore
Angkor during their brutal time in power.
   Since 1979, the pro-Hanoi government has made efforts but with
very few resources and expertise. Now, says Ung Von, there are
prospects for real progress and small numbers of foreign tourists
are starting to return.
   ``I feel like a sick man who is starting to feel well again,''
he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ ``The Prophet'' has guided several generations
of high school and college students through the vicissitudes of
growing up. Now a group of Lebanese-Americans would like to
memorialize its author, their kinsman, Kahlil Gibran. In a city
that abounds with monuments that remind of war, they would make a
quiet place, dedicated to peace.

<TEXT>
   They're going to build a little garden here,
across from the British Embassy where the strident statue of
Winston Churchill, arm and fingers raised in a ``V,'' recalls
memories of an awful war.
   The garden will celebrate peace and understanding, and a writer
whose words helped four decades of American young people out of the
maze of adolescence into the unsure world of adulthood.
   It is a garden that almost wasn't.
   But Lebanese-Americans mobilized in the past few months to raise
most of the $1 million or so needed to beat a National Park Service
deadline and break ground for the wooded two-acre plot dedicated to
their countryman, Kahlil Gibran, author of ``The Prophet.''
   Gibran's romantic dialectic was severely criticized by
academics, but nevertheless captured the interest of generations of
young people, notably in the 1960s, with passages like this:
   ``Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.
   ``And he answered:
   ``Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
   ``And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was
oftentimes filled with your tears.''
   ``The Prophet,'' Gibran's most popular book, is the best-selling
hardcover book on the Alfred A. Knopf list. It has racked up 6
million sales since it was first printed in 1923, and still sells
100,000 a year. The deluxe edition has sold another 363,000 copies
at a steady rate of 11,500 a year, and the paperback has sold
1,886,000 at the rate of 40,000 a year. An audio version brought
out in 1986 sells about 10,000 a year.
   But the plans for a memorial for Gibran were not nearly as
successful, and it looked for a while as if the modest project
might founder.
   It was the idea of Washington housewife Sheryl Ameen, emanating
from her despair over the plight of Lebanon, wracked by civil wars
and invasion. She said she couldn't stand ``the vision of all this
bloodshed... and I felt it was not the true image of the
Lebanese,'' who for 4,000 years had been merchants and travelers,
descendants of the ancient Phoenicians.
   In 1983, the 100th anniversary of Gibran's birth, she determined
to soften the image by building a memorial of some sort to the
gentle writer whose words helped sustain the Rev. Lawrence Jenco in
his captivity in Lebanon. Jenco still quotes him: ``Not everyone in
chains is subdued,'' and ``Hell is not torture. Hell is an empty
heart.''
   Ameen, who is president of the Khalil Gibran Centennial
Foundation, had heard that the comedian Flip Wilson also quoted
Gibran at his performances, and he appeared before Congress in
behalf of the memorial. A resolution providing park service land
for the Gibran garden was written by Maine Sen. George Mitchell,
now majority whip, and the late Rep. Abraham (Chick) Kazan Jr.,
both of Lebanese parentage.
   But the planning was easier than getting the funds. Finally,
another Lebanese, Bill Baroody, former head of the Office of
Communications in the Gerald Ford White House and director of the
American Enterprise Institute, came to the rescue. He mobilized
other prominent Arab-Americans and the money began trickling in.
   Through the summer a series of seven dinners from Boston to Los
Angeles will raise almost half the needed $1 million with the rest
coming from organizations, wealthy individuals and the general
public.
   The deadline for breaking ground is October 19.
   ``It's off the ground and it's going to successfully conclude on
target on time,'' Baroody says. ``It's been a struggle.''
   One of the reasons, he says, is that most Lebanese in America
tended to assimilate totally, to become part of the background. But
in the past 15 to 20 years they have tended to reconnect with their
ethnic pride, partly in response to what was happening in their
tiny native land.
   ``That's why I'm so excited about this project,'' Baroody says.
``With all of the tragedy around Lebanon, the Palestinians, the
whole Middle East situation, this has an incredibly uplifting
potential.''
   Ameen and Baroody want the garden and the foundation to echo
what they believe Gibran stood for: peace and understanding,
mediation and consensus, rational debate and discussion.
   Gibran has plenty of critics in academic circles. They say his
writing is not poetry, more like romantic drivel, an exercise in
dialectics. What does Baroody think?
   ``Basically, I feel sorry for them.''
   The garden in a lush woods near the vice president's residence
and the Naval Observatory will feature a pool and walkways where
visitors can come to meditate. Among the new plantings will be
three 25-foot Cedars of Lebanon, currently growing in a New Jersey
nursery.
   Gibran lived most of his life in the United States. In his last
works, he wrote of an exile who returns to the garden of his
fathers to meditate and says, ``We seek one another in our
aloneness.''

   If you're 30 something you've probably never
heard of Richard Grieco, but if you're under 30 you know he's the
hottest ``hunk'' in the fall television season's coolest new show.
   Grieco set young hearts throbbing last year in Fox's ``21 Jump
Street'' as the handsome, brooding, rebel cop Dennis Booker.
   In September, Grieco will be spun off into ``Booker,'' which
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the New York advertising agency, forecasts as
the only hit of the television season. That the show is on the
so-called fourth network speaks to Grieco's appeal and to the
changing face of television.
   ``Booker's rebellious in the sense that he doesn't do things by
the book,'' Grieco says. ``He's unorthodox, but he's honest. They
brought me onto `21 Jump Street' to be an antagonist, then get
killed off after six shows. I guess the audience liked my character
and they decided to keep me on.
   ``We'll get more into his private life on the new show. We know
he has a mother, but they didn't get along. He's a loner. He didn't
even have a girlfriend. They brought someone on but it didn't last
long.''
   In the final episode of ``21 Jump Street'' in the past season,
Booker arrested Tom Hanson, played by Johnny Depp, on a charge of
murder. The story picks up in the first episode of ``21 Jump
Street'' in September.
   ``I get Johnny out on a 48-hour pass and we retrace the steps of
what happened,'' Grieco says. ``What happens is I uncover a lot of
corruption in the city government. I offend a lot of people in high
places and have to leave the police force and become a private
detective.''
   ``Booker'' takes over the Sunday night time slot of ``21 Jump
Street'' _ which jumps to Monday to open a new night of programming
for Fox.
   Grieco's longish black hair is combed up and back and falls
loosely over his face. He is dark, with dark eyes and a wide mouth
that curls up into a half-smile. He's Italian on his father's side
and Irish on his mother's. He's wearing jeans, a black T-shirt with
sunglasses stuck into the neck and a leather wrist bracelet with
big, silvery studs.
   He's bigger than he appears on screen. He's 6 feet tall,
muscular, but down to 165 pounds compared to the 220 he weighed
when he played college football. He collects vintage motorcycles.
   In the new show, Booker goes to work for a large company called
the Yamada Corp.
   Booker will occasionally ride a motorcycle as a symbol of
freedom.
   ``He's a fish out of water,'' explains Grieco. ``He's surrounded
by all these corporate types. They're not used to people like me.
My uniform is basically what I'm wearing now, a T-shirt and jeans.
They're into suits and ties. He tries to get along with the people
but he doesn't conform. I'm basically the house detective, but I'll
also take cases from the outside. So, it's the hip side of `21 Jump
Street' with the background of `L.A. Law.'''
   Grieco grew up in Watertown, N.Y., just south of the Canadian
border, where he played hockey, lacrosse and football. His father
also collects motorcycles, including a 1941 Indian Scout and a 1939
three-wheeler. Grieco has a 1954 Harley-Davidson that he keeps in
Watertown.
   He went to Central Connecticut State on a football scholarship
and majored in political science. At first, he thought he was going
to become a lawyer but started acting in college.
   Grieco left school after three semesters and four knee
operations due to football injuries.
   In New York he was a model but soon began to study acting. He
joined the soap opera ``One Life To Live'' as Rick Gardener, a
character he jokingly referred to as ``a rebel ski bum.'' While he
was on the show he got more mail than anyone else.
   ``I remember my first day on the set,'' he says. ``I'd been on
stage but never in front of a camera before. I was so nervous I
couldn't speak. The producer kept calling the sound booth and
saying, `He's not breathing.'''
   Two years ago he moved to Los Angeles and landed roles on ``Rags
to Riches,'' ``Who's the Boss'' and ``The Bronx Zoo.''
   He auditioned for ``21 Jump Street'' with about 100 other
actors. He was called back five times before he got the role. Then
he had little time before he had to fly to Vancouver, British
Columbia.
   ``Booker'' also will be filmed in Vancouver, where Steven
Williams, Peter DeLuise and other stars of ``Jump Street'' will
occasionally pay a visit to the new show.

   Consider the chances of success for a play
called ``Other People's Money.''
   The author's last work folded on opening night.
   The leading man left to make a film before rehearsals started.
His replacement backed out the day rehearsals were supposed to
begin.
   The third choice, Kevin Conway, was not exactly a box-office
name.
   The director, Gloria Muzio, was even less well known.
   And the Wall Street crash of October 1987 made the subject
matter _ the takeover of a small company by a ruthless tycoon _
seem out-of-date to many experienced theater people.
   None of the above stopped neophyte producers Jeffrey Ash and
Susan Gallin from opening ``Other People's Money'' last February at
the Minetta Lane Theater. In six months, the play by Jerry Sterner
has slowly become one of off-Broadway's biggest hits, with the
sold-out sign now going up for almost every performance.
   ``The favorable word-of-mouth has really done it for us,'' says
Gallin, whose only other producing effort in New York was ``Burn
This'' by Lanford Wilson two years ago.
   Such diverse theatergoers as theater critic John Simon and
business tycoons Carl Ichan and Donald Trump _ Trump saw the play
twice _ have praised ``Other People's Money.'' Trump even offered
to move the play to Broadway, a proposal declined by Ash and Gallin.
   ``I think a successful play on Broadway today has to almost
approach being a musical,'' Ash says. ``It has to have either a
star or something out of the ordinary. Broadway has come to be a
place only for muscials and extravaganzas, and off-Broadway has
become a place to do good plays, like `Driving Miss Daisy,' `The
Cocktail Hour' or `Other People's Money.'''
   Producing a play off-Broadway also is different from producing
on Broadway. Because the theaters are smaller, so are the profit
margins. The line between a profitable and an unprofitable week can
be narrow. Most new off-Broadway shows need time to build audiences.
   Ash and Gallin figured they would lose money during the early
weeks of the run, the time needed for favorable audience reaction
to pay off. Their general manager told them to expect 12 weeks of
losses. They budgeted the show at $525,000, including a reserve
fund of $120,000 raised to pay for a heavy advertising campaign.
   ``I had seen too many mornings when the producers have to scurry
to try and raise money to run an ad or a television spot,'' Ash
says. ``And then they wind up giving away all their producers'
points, selling their soul to get that money. It's terrible.''
   Ash knows something about selling shows. Although ``Other
People's Money'' is his first producing effort, he has been in
theatrical advertising for more than 20 years. Now director of
theatrical accounts for Grey Entertainment and Media, Ash was a
pioneer in developing live-action television ads for Broadway plays
and musicals.
   Ash worked on the advertising for Sterner's last venture, the
short-lived ``Be Happy for Me.'' Despite its quick departure, they
became friends. Sterner knew that Ash wanted to produce and brought
him a copy of ``Other People's Money,'' his second play in early
1987.
   ``I read it and fell quite in love with it,'' Ash recalls.
   The story concerns a barracuda-like corporate raider who wants
to take over a family-owned business that is the lifeblood of a
small New England town. The company hires an attractive female
attorney to battle the takeover artist, and their fights turn from
the financial to the sexual.
   The play had some readings on the West Coast and with actor Paul
Sorvino, who was interested in playing the lead. He didn't, but the
play was done at his American Stage Company in Teaneck, N.J,. in
the spring of 1987.
   Audience reaction was favorable, and Ash had lined up an
investor to put up half the amount needed to bring the play to New
York. Then the stock market crashed in October and the money
evaporated.
   Gallin then entered the picture. She became interested in the
play after a good friend, Davina Belling, went after the movie
rights.
   ``I read a lot of plays, and this one left me with something to
think about,'' Gallin says. ``And it was very entertaining. I even
gave it to people who weren't in the theater to read and I got a
wonderful reaction.''
   Ash and Gallin decided to produce the play together off-Broadway
and went looking for a director. The two producers sought
suggestions from their friends in the theater business. Mark Lamos,
artistic director of the Hartford Stage Company, was on the top of
everybody's list.
   Lamos had other commitments, but a play reader at his theater
recommended it. Lamos finally read ``Other People's Money'' and
loved it. The play, directed by Gloria Muzio, was done at the
Hartford Stage as part of its 1988-89 season.
   ``That was a wonderful experience,'' Gallin says. ``It was good
for the play and for Jerry, who was able to do some rewriting, and
for Gloria, our director, who had time to polish the production.''
   It was the Hartford production, with Conway as a last-minute
replacement as the new leading man, that made it to New York.
   The show opened with a miniscule advance and a favorable but not
overwhelming review in The New York Times, which didn't deter the
two producers.
   ``We did a radio campaign, sponsoring business reports on
all-news radio stations in New York, advertised in the Wall Street
Journal and sent letters to the CEOs of many corporations and
invited them to come,'' Ash says.
   Now the stretch limos are regular fixtures in front of the
Minetta Lane Theater, as well as more ordinary theatergoers drawn
by the favorable word-of-mouth. Ash and Gallin are now
contemplating a national tour for the play, probably with a star,
and also a London production.
   ``It's a play that stays with people somehow,'' Ash says. ``They
keep talking about it for days afterward. And even two years after
the big stock market crash, it's relevant. You pick up the
newspaper and you see this thing about Warner Brothers and Time
magazine and Paramount. The subject is still current.''

   ``Mississippi Burning'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.98.
Rated R)
   
   In the summer of 1964, young men and women from around the
nation poured into Mississippi to take part in ``Freedom Summer,''
a concerted effort to register black voters in the segregated
state. One was 20-year-old Andrew Goodman, a student at Queens
College. On June 21, Goodman and two members of CORE (Congress of
Racial Equality), Michael Schwerner and James Chaney, drove to the
town of Lawndale where a black church had been burned. They never
returned.
   They were stopped for speeding near Philadelphia and jailed for
several hours on bogus charges. After being released that night,
the workers failed to call in. After an extensive search, involving
the FBI and 200 sailors, and a tip from a ``Mr. X,'' the bodies
were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm outside of Philadelphia.
   A fictionalized account of the murder of those three young
volunteers is unraveled in Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning.''
The movie is by no means an accurate or riveting account of that
strange and horrendous period in American history. Rather, it is a
detective story that boils down to the
   typical Hollywood good cop-bad cop treatment. It is male bonding
redux.
   Parker focuses on two FBI agents sent to Mississippi to
investigate the disappearance of the civil rights workers. Ward
(Willem Dafoe) is the upstanding, neatly suited partner who plays
things by the book. Anderson (Gene Hackman) is a redneck and a
maverick. He does things his way and has a short fuse.
   
   Their search, and Anderson's seething tensions are relentless.
Through plot twists that suspend disbelief, they discover the
bodies and peel away the facade of white Southern virtue, exposing
it as an ugly, oozing canker sore. In the meantime, Parker almost
has his audience cheering for the wonderful FBI. But the reality is
that the FBI was more a harassment to blacks and sympathetic whites
during the civil rights struggle than heroic knight. The movie also
overlooks those who were at the very helm of the movement and who
led and suffered through that summer. Blacks are mere pimples on
the landscape in Parker's thinking; they stand by and do nothing.
They have no passions, no aggressions, no thoughts.
   The strength of ``Mississippi Burning'' is not its shallow look
at segregation, but its performances, especially by Hackman. His
portrayal of Anderson is one of the best in his career. He
steamrolls through the movie with volcanic force, filling the
theater with a crackling tension and good ole boy charm. Dafoe is,
by necessity, the antithesis, and he delivers well. Taken as a
detective film, ``Mississippi Burning'' (the FBI file name for the
case), is a fine piece of entertainment, and works well on the home
screen. But don't expect a credible history lesson.

   ``Witchery'' (Vidmark Entertainment. VHS, $79.95. No rating.)
   
   ``Witchery'' is a simply terrible film with absolutely no
redeeming virtues.
   Linda Blair, who first horrified audiences as the possessed
youngster in ``The Exorcist,'' and David Hasselhoff (TV's ``Night
Rider'') fail to save this piece of junk. Their lackluster acting,
coupled with an impossibly bad script, should cause this video to
gather dust on the store shelf.
   There is graphic violence and gore, including garroting,
crucifixion, rape and other bits of murderous mayhem. But the story
is so incredibly weak that even these excesses can't boost it to
any interesting level.
   It has the look and feel of a made-for-TV movie, and is as dull
as the worst sitcom.
   Blair plays an investigator of paranormal phenomena. She's
appears half asleep most of the time, mumbling her way through her
lines. Hasselhoff, a photographer and Blair's fiance, tries to make
the best of it with dialogue about as snappy as a grapefruit
commercial. The two have come to a New England island to take
pictures of an old hotel that resembles a witch during certain
times of the day.
   As the witch, Hildegard Knef is about the best thing going in
the movie. Michael Manches plays the most credible role as Tommy, a
child who communicates with the witch.

   ``Twins'' ( MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG)
   
   Not since Laurel and Hardy has such a physically contrasting
comedy team come along: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito.
   ``Twins'' is simply wonderful entertainment. It's silly,
improbable, irreverent.
   Schwarzenegger and DeVito play twin brothers who were separated
at birth. No joke. Seems mom was this ``exceptional'' woman who
gave her body to a secret biological experiment in creating a
superman. Something went wrong, the egg split and a runt turned up
as well.
   As they reunite, search for their mom, dodge a hitman, uncover
the truth of their origins and otherwise scheme and hustle their
way through the movie, the duo provide enough laughs to fill a
Sunday afternoon family viewing.
   DeVito continues to impress with good comedic work, both in
direction and acting. Schwarzenegger, usually a heavy (in more ways
than one), is a giggle in a lighter mood. Ivan Reitman directed
``Twins.''

   ```Batman' Soundtrack'' (Warner Bros.) _ Prince
   
   Leave it to Prince to score a No. 1 record at precisely the time
his record company wanted him out of the stores.
   With sagging record sales due, at least in part, to
overexposure, Warner Bros. wanted Prince on the shelf for awhile.
But Prince foiled those plans by dashing off a soundtrack to
``Batman'' in a matter of days after being inspired by the movie.
   Though ``Batman'' has turned virtually everything it touches to
gold, the single ``Batdance'' still qualifies as one of the
strangest hit songs in years. It's not even a song, really, just a
six-minute collage of dialogue from the film with a jarring tempo
change in the middle.
   In other words, it manages to break just about every rule and
still be compelling. It doesn't hurt that it contains one of
Prince's best guitar solos in years.
   The hurried nature of this project is apparent throughout the
rest of the soundtrack _ to both good and bad effect.
   Prince seems liberated by the need to work in a hurry. It forces
discipline and leaves no room for the musical conceits that cloud
some of his recent work. In retrospect, it often seems the more
time he has to work on a song, the further he strays from the
original idea.
   The music is simple and straightforward, by nature some of
Prince's most commercial work. Songs such as ``Partyman,'' ``Vicki
Waiting'' and ``Electric Chair'' prove Prince can write serviceable
funk in his sleep.
   The downside is the appearance of the first Prince work that can
rightfully be called hackneyed. The ballad ``Scandalous'' and the
Sheena Easton duet ``The Arms of Orion'' are excruciating. There
isn't a memorable lyric on the album, and no innovations to make
you shake your head in surprise.
   But it's tough to argue with a No. 1 record. Prince didn't have
to dance with the devil in the pale moonlight for this hit. Maybe
just the Joker.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Get Serious</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``Young Einstein'' opens Aug. 4</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   You've got to take Yahoo seriously, after he
has written, directed, produced and starred in a movie being
released by a major film company.
   First of all, about his name.
   ``It's on my passport; it's been like that since I was at art
school: Yahoo Serious,'' explains the 35-year-old Australian
virtuoso who stars in ``Young Einstein.''
   ``I changed it to have an art work of a name but also make it a
laugh. It kind of fit in with the rest of the stuff I did _ the
weird hair, and weirder clothes and stuff. I had this really
ordinary name (Greg Pead) and I thought, `I can do better than
this.'
   ```Yahoo' is almost impossible to say unless you're having a
good time. `Serious,' I guess, is the director's side of me. I
dunno. It's kind of a parody on names, I suppose.''
   The other remarkable thing about Serious is the hair. It's a
brown mass that rises from his head like a bramble bush. He calls
it ``an Australian surfing haircut'' and claims it's the reason he
chose to portray Einstein _ ``he's the only historical character
with the same haircut.''
   Serious came here for his first exposure to the American media.
He may well be the biggest Australian import since Paul Hogan. His
film, ``Young Einstein,'' has broken records of ``Rambo,'' ``Star
Wars'' and the like in his home country. Warner Bros. is hoping,
not without some nervousness, that Serious will catch on here.
   It's hard to describe ``Young Einstein.'' You might call it a
combination of rock music, silent-screen slapstick and bogus
history. Yahoo plays Albert Einstein at the age of 26, when he
discovered both relativity and rock 'n' roll. All this happens in
Australia, you see.
   The inspiration for ``Young Einstein'' came during a trip down
the Amazon River. He relates it with such sincerity that you want
to believe him.
   ``I crossed the Andes with a mate, and we ended up on the border
of Peru and Brazil and I think Colombia. We were going to take a
boat down the Amazon. I don't think they had Australians aboard
before because we drank them out of beer in two days.
   ``We put in at a little village. The Brazilian native who was
carrying the beer on board wore a T-shirt with a picture of Albert
Einstein sticking his tongue out. Where he got the T-shirt in the
middle of the Amazon jungle, I don't know. That was the
inspiration: The greatest mind of the 20th Century doing something
so irreverent and childlike at the age of 72. I thought, wow, we've
got the basis for a film here.''
   Serious had dabbled in film before, making documentaries that
somehow came out as comedies. How to sell a feature? He decided to
do it by degrees. He sold his car, bought some film, borrowed a
camera, gathered a cast and crew and began shooting. When he ran
out of money, he borrowed an editing machine, put together what he
had filmed and sought financing.
   Amazingly, he found backing from some investors, the Australian
Film Commission, an Australian distributor _ and Warner Bros. He
was able to finish ``Young Einstein'' the way he wanted, ``with a
cast of thousands and a huge musical score and eight rock songs.''
   He was born in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. He quit
school to work as a tire fitter so he could afford to attend art
school. It became apparent early on that he had to express himself
not with brush and paint, but with the magic of comedy.
   ``I was fed by two of the major cultures, besides having the
indigenous, sardonic, self-effacing Australian humor,'' he
recalled. ``The Monty Python influence came on TV from England. At
the same time there were all the wonderful '60s situation comedies
from here, like `Green Acres,' `The Addams Family,' `Get Smart' and
all the others. Bugs Bunny was also a huge influence.
   ``At the same time, I loved epic films, especially David Lean's.
`Lawrence of Arabia' was a huge influence on me. I loved the idea
of putting comedy in a film of epic proportions. I had no idea it
was going to be a big hit, that's all.''
   Yahoo Serious is already a notable in Australia, and he'll
certainly be the same here, with his electrocuted hair and his
uniform of flowery Hawaiian shirt and floppy white shorts. The
recognition doesn't bother him: ``I usually get `G'dy, Yahoo,'
`G'dy, Yahoo,' that sort of stuff. Like I say, the word Yahoo makes
people feel good.''
   Can we expect ``Young Einstein II''?
   ``Sequels are good when they are a small part of what is being
made,'' he said. ``When they're the bulk of what's being made, I
think it's self-defeating. Maybe when I'm a grey-haired old guy and
we've forgotten about sequels, maybe we'll see `Einstein Goes to
Princeton' or something like that. But there won't be a sequel in
the foreseeable future.''

<HEAD>The Artists: In Love With a 20th-Century Modern</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's easy to pick out Barbara Nissman in a crowd
of pianists: She's the one who's known for playing Sergei Prokofiev
and Alberto Ginastera.
   ``What a joy to find composers in this century one can be
passionate about!'' she says. ``Prokofiev is a 20th-century modern
continuing the Romantic tradition. I believe the music cries out to
be played that way.''
   Nissman, whose parents were born in the Soviet Union, studied
Russian language and literature at the University of Michigan, as
well as music. Ginastera visited the campus in the late 1960s when
she was rehearsing his piano concerto and liked the way she played
it. They kept in touch and, during the 15 years she pursued her
career in Europe, she often played his music. The composer
dedicated his ``Third Piano Sonata'' to her.
   ``I play all three. They're wonderful. I think the first is his
masterpiece. My favorite of his works is `Argentine Dances,' which
he wrote for solo piano when he was 18,'' Nissman said.
   ``His widow, who's a cellist, and I are going to record the
cello concerto he wrote for her. It never has been recorded. I
think he would have been pleased.''
   Nissman recorded all nine Prokofiev piano sonatas for Newport
Classic, distributed on cassettes and compact discs by MCA. Volume
2 was released in July with Volume 3 set for August.
   Last season she played all nine sonatas in three concerts at New
York's Alice Tully Hall, the first time that has been done in one
season. She repeated it at Wigmore Hall in London. Next season
she'll do the cycle in the Netherlands and other American cities.
   ``There are plans for me to do the cycle in Russia _ an American
of Russian origin going to play Russian music for Russians,'' said
Nissman, who has been invited by the Central State Archives in
Moscow to go through Prokofiev's piano sketches.
   ``They've done it with his symphonies, operas and ballets. Maybe
I can find some manuscripts that haven't been discovered.''
   Asked in a recent interview what led her to play the Prokofiev
cycle, she said, ``Just following my nose, exploring music that is
not often played in concert. I had played several of the sonatas
with the BBC Symphony. I decided to look at the ones I didn't know.
I wasn't disappointed at all.
   ``I also found a fragment of a 10th sonata and a second version
of the fifth,'' she said. ``I had the first page of the fragment
and wrote the archives in Moscow to see if there was a second page.
It arrived an hour before the premiere was to be given and I
sight-read it at the concert.
   ``It transformed my conception of the first page. He went in a
completely different direction. It was very exciting to have that,
to realize that at the end of his life he was going back to the
lyrical style of the ninth sonata.''
   That fragment of the 10th sonata was the last thing Prokofiev
wrote before he died in 1953. ``It ends in the middle of a measure.
He had a fall, but kept on writing on his deathbed.''
   Nissman will make a Liszt recording this fall. ``I can't give up
Liszt. He's one of my favorites,'' she says. ``They come from the
same tradition. They all really knew and respected the piano and
delighted in virtuosity, which is very appealing to the public and
to a pianist.
   ``Prokofiev built on tradition with his own personality. That's
the essence of what modern means _ being his own man yet building
upon a foundation, using those elements to make it his own and have
something personal to say.
   ``People came to the recitals resisting Prokofiev,'' she said.
``The preconception is dissonance, that the music should be played
without emotion, with a hard, dry, brittle sound. They were amazed
at the lyricism and emotional content and what they felt when they
were listening to the music.
   ``There is so much there. In his simplicity, Prokofiev is truly
profound. I would say the essence of his music is the wonderful
simplicity. He communicates directly. That's what one wants from
any composer, to touch the soul.''
   Nissman recalled that when she was a child and heard ``Peter and
the Wolf,'' she was delighted with the melodies.
   ``And his piano music abounds with wonderful melodies. The fifth
sonata is the weakest because of the lack of melody,'' she said.
   ``But the weakest for Prokofiev is still pretty darn good.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Eclectic English Band Finds Mainstream Acceptance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a summer dominated by ``classic rock'' radio,
and concerts by reformed 1970s supergroups, Love and Rockets has
managed to take its intriguing mix of dreamy mood music and
jackhammer metal into the Top 20.
   While the members of the British trio express no love for oldies
stations or the ubiquitous reunion tours, don't count them among
the bands complaining that a newer band can't make it in 1989.
   The band, currently on tour in support of its fourth album,
``Love and Rockets,'' has found a good outlet for its music on
college radio. And concert crowds, which include fans of Love and
Rockets' predecessor, the early '80s group Bauhaus, have been
growing on the strength of the band's first U.S. hit single, ``So
Alive.''
   ``We're over the moon, we are,'' said Daniel Ash of the band's
current success.
   Ash plays bass, guitar, and saxophone and sings about half the
band's songs. Rounding out Love and Rockets are the brother team of
David J. on guitar, bass, harmonica and vocals, and drummer Kevin
Haskins.
   David J. said each of the band's U.S. tours has found audiences
bigger and more knowledgeable of the group's work.
   ``The familiarity grows every time we come back. The songs are
more recognizable to a greater part of the audience,'' he said.
``This is the most definitive record we've done so far. That's why
we called it simply `Love and Rockets.'''
   Defining the group's sound is an elusive task, as Love and
Rockets works in a musical universe that has room for the
latter-day psychedelia of ``The Teardrop Collector,'' as well as
the noise explosion of ``No Big Deal.''
   It's almost an axiom that the rise in popularity of ``classic
rock'' radio, with its emphasis on '70s-style hard rock, has made
it difficult for less established groups to get airplay or
attention. That phenomenon has been accompanied this summer by
reunion tours by such veteran acts as The Who, the Doobie Brothers
and the Allman Brothers Band.
   But Ash said that despite the attention to older rock music, in
some ways the band has had better access to the airwaves here than
back home in England. Being heard on college radio has paved the
way to increased mainstream acceptance, he said.
   ``I think the college radio situation in the U.S.A. is
excellent; it's a great idea,'' Ash said. ``With the college
stations in America, they love playing their music and there isn't
any commercial consideration. They play what they actually like.''
   The ideal radio station, Ash said, would play new records and
also some good old music. ``Why not play something that was
recorded in 1964, and then something that was recorded last
Tuesday?'' he said.
   Ash said he felt strongly that rock 'n' roll groups have a
limited life span. He said he was opposed to the current wave of
tours by veteran rockers.
   ``The Who shouldn't exist. It's stupid,'' Ash said. ``It's like
a contradiction of what they were originally about. It's nonsense,
it's a rip-off.
   ``They're too old to do that sort of music. When you sing songs
like `My Generation' and see guys in their mid-40s ... it's
hilarious, it's wrong,'' Ash said. ``When you're involved in
something like contemporary music, it's real important to realize
when you look ridiculous.''
   He said Love and Rockets is just now hitting its prime.
   ``We just work on whatever feels right at the time,'' he said.
``We've grown close as a group. We can be open enough to know when
somebody's doing something wrong.''
   With its popularity growing, the band is recording some of its
current tour dates for a possible live album. Also in the works is
a home video compilation and mini-album of songs recorded around
the time of ``Love and Rockets'' but which did not fit in with the
sound of that album.
   David J. described the mini-album as ``a cross between the
Andrews Sisters, Glenn Miller and Captain Beefheart.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Individuals and Individual Voices</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phillip Lopate prefers sitting behind a
typewriter to standing atop a soapbox. He distrusts movements,
getting caught up in any event larger than himself.
   A man of caution, he remembers with discomfort the 1960s group
ritual of passing a body from one set of arms to another. What he
does trust is the individual voice, expressed in writing through
the personal essay.
   ``I think it's important because it's a direct conversation
between the writer and the reader, and has the flavor of
personality,'' said Lopate, author of ``Against Joie de Vivre''
(Poseidon Press, $18.95), a collection of personal essays.
   ``If you believe in individuals and individual voices, then it's
one of the ways of getting a sense of dialogue going. A personal
essay gives you a model of a human being in all his hesitations and
faults and confusions.''
   His tales are more of observation than experience. Lopate
examines the myth of Samson and Delilah, deconstructs the manners
of dinner parties and, in the title essay, attacks mindless
optimism.
   ``I think I have a streak of detachmant which is very suitable
for being a writer and maybe not so suitable for other activities.
It's very hard to knock me off course. I'm always watching in some
way, some part of me refuses to be swept away,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``When I write, I'm able to get a sense of perspective. So that
experiences which are too painful for someone else to contemplate,
I can think about with a certain humor, a certain wryness and begin
to shape them.''
   He is, admittedly, a believer in committing experiences to
memory as they occur, even at the risk of reducing their emotional
impact. Detachment is vital, he insists, a way of examining an
issue to its fullest and working through to a well-considered
conclusion.
   ``I tend to analyze and brood over what has happened to me until
I make little stories,'' Lopate said.
   ``My essays have a strong story-telling impulse. Sometimes,
they're really on the borderline between fiction and nonfiction;
they're shaped in the narrative way. They're about characters,
people as characters.''
   Lopate, who worked as a writer-in-residence at a public school
in Manhattan, uses this approach in ``Suicide of a Schoolteacher,''
examining the feelings brought on when a colleague takes his own
life.
   ``When I write about something traumatic, I'm trying to overcome
the pain and put it behind me,'' he said. ``Then I think I don't
have to write about it anymore, I've dealt with it. But I also
write to hold onto things that would otherwise be lost. It's a
salvaging process.''
   Lopate attended Columbia University in the early '60s, acquiring
a passion for films that never subsided. He is currently on the
selection committee of the New York Film Festival and credits
movies with helping develop his skills at narration.
   ``Sometimes you learn an art by studying another art. I learned
the grammar of film and it helped me to write. There's a great deal
of cinematic influence in my writing. A lot of times, the scene
will unroll as I'm experiencing it.''
   In ``Chekhov for Children,'' Lopate describes the sometimes
tortuous process of directing a dozen adolescents in the Russian
playwright's bleak ``Uncle Vanya.''
   He knows that detachment doesn't work with children or the
theater, and writes of the emotional highs and lows experienced
during rehearsals.
   ``Children are always surprising,'' he said. ``I watch them and
find them very dramatic. They don't tone down their response so
much. They'll tell you they hate you or love you; they don't
disguise very much.
   ``That can be invigorating, and it can also be humiliating. If a
kid doesn't like you, it's more of a setback than if an adult
doesn't like you, because you feel they're responding very
naturally.''
   ``Against Joie de Vivre'' is Lopate's seventh book. He has also
published a previous collection of essays and an account of his
public school experience, ``Being With Children,'' two volumes of
poetry and two novels, including the well-received ``The Rug
Merchant'' in 1987.
   Lopate views the world as a stage and himself a dispassionate
critic, interpreting the actors' performances to the audience at
large.
   ``Some writers are fascinated with language; I want to write
beautifully and eloquently, but much more important is for me to
capture character on the page _ starting with my own character and
using that to spread outward, to use myself as a messenger that
will bring back the world.''
   He sees himself as fighting to maintain integrity in a world
where people hide their real feelings. For Lopate, the personal
essay is a written form of protest, a modern equivalent of burning
his draft card.
   ``There's something almost subversive about the personal
essay,'' he said. ``It empowers the individual. I also think that
in a time when many writers are afraid to say explicitly what they
think, as in fiction when they show but they don't tell too much,
the essay becomes a place where the writer testifies without a
disguise of what she or he knows.''

   Bobby Vinton, still singing about love
and loneliness 27 years after his first hit record, believes the
title of his current album reflects his music: ``Timeless.''
   Vinton, a trim and youthful looking 54, continues to turn out
romantic ballads reminiscent of ``Roses Are Red'' _ his 1962
breakthrough song on the national record charts.
   The first single release from ``Timeless'' is ``Please Tell Her
That I Said Hello,'' which is about a man crying over an old lover.
Other selections on the album include such love songs as ``Getting
Used to Being Loved Again,'' and ``I Made Love (With You Tonight).''
   ``I feel my music is timeless,'' Vinton, nicknamed ``the Polish
prince,'' said in an interview. ```Roses Are Red' and `Blue Velvet'
still sound good today, and you can relate to them. There will
always be that type of music. There will always be a love singer, a
singer of stories and simplicity.''
   He's been flirting with a country, downhome feel to his music
for the past few years. He uses fiddles and steel guitars on
``Timeless'' and is trying to get country music radio stations
interested in his music so that he can be heard on the same outlets
that feature Willie Nelson, Randy Travis and George Strait.
   ``I could be the beginning of the next dimension in country
music,'' Vinton said. ``The country music DJs today are the old pop
DJs of the '60s. We've all made the changes together.
   ``Country music is expanding. Radio stations are finding that if
you play a Bobby Vinton type of artist, you can pick up listeners
from adult contemporary stations who are getting too rock 'n'
rollish.
   ``Country music is becoming the pop music of the '60s,'' he
said. ``And that's where I came from. Country music is more than
guys in a bar or guys in a corral. It's really growing.''
   Vinton has sold 50 million records since ``Roses Are Red.'' His
other hit records, mostly in the mid-1960s, include ``Blue
Velvet,'' ``There I've Said It Again,'' ``Mr. Lonely,'' ``Blue on
Blue,'' ``I Love How You Love Me,'' ``Sealed With a Kiss,''
``Everyday of My Life'' and finally, in 1974, ``My Melody of Love.''
   His memories of three of his biggest hits:
   _ ``Roses Are Red'': ``came out around graduation time and it
was a great farewell song.''
   _ ``Blue Velvet'': ``was recorded with 10 minutes left on the
recording session. I didn't pick it and didn't like it.''
   _ ``Mr. Lonely'': ``related to lonely people. There's loneliness
in all of us and I felt it; I dug back in my soul for this and
people felt the loneliness.''
   He said he did well with love songs because he believed in their
message and their emotion. ``I really feel them. I don't feel rock
'n' roll. You feel what you have inside and I have a lot of this.
You can't fake it. I had an honesty about the records.''
   He did as well in his own romantic life as he did singing about
it. He's been married to his wife, his only one, for 27 years.
   His ``There I've Said It Again'' in 1964 holds the distinction
in pop music of being the last No. 1 record before the Beatles led
the ``British invasion'' of English bands who changed the sound of
rock 'n' roll music.
   Vinton was able to maintain a career, but many of his peers were
never as popular again.
   ``They eliminated my competition,'' Vinton said about the effect
the Beatles had on male vocalists of his style.
   A whole new generation of record buyers is alive now and Vinton
is still competing for their dollars.
   ``I lasted because I made the right songs _ good, honest,
emotional records. I do shows and give them a show they can't
resist. So they come back year after year and see me. I've changed
my show to make it fresh, make it different.
   ``My music is part of a lot of their lives,'' he said. ``It
brings back memories: their youth, their first date, their
marriage. So they want to go out and enjoy their early life and
growing up and all of that.''
   He feels that he's a much better performer than he was 20 years
ago.
   ``I was awful then. I was young, inexperienced, nervous and I
wasn't the confident performer I am today. Luckily, I was able to
stick around to the point where I can walk on stage today and have
control of the audience.
   ``Being an entertainer is like being a surgeon,'' said Vinton.
``The longer you do it, the better you get at it.''

<HEAD>Golden Years Dimmed by Abuse for Many Elderly</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>

   Alice didn't dare wait for the elevator.
   She ran down six flights of stairs, her 69 years weighing heavy
_ less for the age and a bad hip, more for her 52-year-old son who
was waving a knife and threatening to kill her. Out on the street
Alice headed for a neighbor's phone to tell the police her son had
turned abusive again.
   ``You work and support a child all your life,'' she said from
New York City, where she lives. ``Then they act like they hate
you.''
   Alice (not her real name) isn't alone. As many as 2 million
elderly people may be abused, researchers say, often by children,
grandchildren, even great-grandchildren _ the very people they
depend on for care in their old age.
   ``This happens with these blood relatives _ sons, daughters,
nieces, nephews,'' said Dorothy Brodie, a 75-year-old retired
social worker who works with the Bronx Elder Abuse Support Projsaid Elizabeth
Holtzman, District Attorney of the New York borough of Brooklyn,
where elder abuse has risen 400 percent since 1986 to 370 cases
last year. She attributes the increase to abusers' use of crack
cocaine.
   Last year, 140,000 cases of elder abuse were reported
nationwide, an increase of 10 percent from 1987, said Toshio
Tatara, director of the National Aging Resource Center on Elder
Abuse in Washington, D.C. ``People still find it incredible that we
abuse our elders. They said the same thing about children 20 years
ago. And we're doing it like a national pastime.''
   Tatara believes just one in 14 cases is likely to be reported.
   The victim usually is 75 or older, a woman and generally
dependent, the abuser a son or daughter, the congressional report
found.
   Lawmakers heard about a 68-year-old South Carolina woman whose
daughter kept her in a room so cold the urine in a catheter froze;
a 75-year-old retired nurse from Massachusetts whose 42-year-old
son attacked him with a hatchet; a San Francisco woman whose
$167,000 estate was whittled to $3,000 by a son-in-law.
   ``These cases are really difficult and scary even to experienced
social workers,'' said Lucy Friedman, director of the Victim
Services Agency in New York, which helped Alice seek a temporary
restraining order against her son.
   ``I was really afraid of him,'' said Alice, who bears a scar on
her neck where her son once sliced her. ``Once he gets the wine, he
goes crazy.''
   The abusers many times have their own problems: drug and alcohol
abuse, unemployment, money, mental illness. Violence may be
repayment for abuse a son or daughter received. A cramped house may
spark it; middle-aged children free at last of their own children
may resent the intrusion of a frail parent. In some cases, it's the
stress of caring for an elderly parent.
   Paramedics answering a call in the Los Angeles suburb of San
Fernando found 77-year-old Virginia Grimes Jeter covered with
excrement and maggots in a filthy bedroom. She died five hours
later.
   The woman's daughter, Cynthia Jeter Green, 39, had promised her
mother not to put her in an old folks' home, said Prosecutor Lee
Harris. A probation report found Ms. Green ``was under a degree of
emotional distress.''
   She pleaded no contest April 12 to elder abuse and was ordered
to begin psychiatric counseling and perform 300 hours of community
service. She did not return several calls requesting an interview.
   ``The idea that people for some reason or another do not want to
put their loved ones in a nursing home or feel they have to be
responsible for total care is fairly common in these cases,'' said
Rosalie Wolf, associate director of the University Center on Aging
at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.
   Part of the solution is getting seniors to take responsibility
for stopping and even preventing abuse, said Lee Pearson, assistant
manager of criminal justice services for the American Association
of Retired Persons.
   The elderly should keep regular appointments and stay in touch
with old friends, especially if they move in with a relative,
Pearson said. They should have someone stop by once a week to make
sure all is well.
   New York's Victim Services Agency offers a 24-hour hotline,
individual and group counseling and help in court, getting locks
changed, and finding shelter, transportation and clothing. In a
Bronx group called Safe Place, the elderly hesitantly confide what
has happened to them and try to make sense of it.
   ``People just believe and hope so much that this will be the
last time, things will change, he won't do it again. But they do,''
said Diana Walcott, director of the Bronx Elder Abuse Support
Project and leader of Safe Place.
   In many cases, the parents blame themselves, Ms. Friedman said.
``They say `Well, how did I bring up this monster?'''
   Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have statutes
requiring reporting of elder abuse, but those involved with the
cases say the nation has a long way to go toward recognizing the
problem.
   The states spend an average $22 per abused child, but just $2.90
for each abused older person, Congress found. Its report
recommended emergency shelters, tax credits for families caring for
older adults, amendments to Medicare and Medicaid eliminating
limitations on benefits and services to elderly people cared for by
family members at home, and mandatory reporting of abuse.
   ``It's so foreign to our thinking,'' said Ms. Holtzman.
``Doctors won't even ask if abuse has taken place. It's possible
the person, once cured, will be sent back to the same environment,
possibly to be killed.''

<HEAD>Banks Zero in on Affluent and Fast-Growing Senior Set</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to the nation's fastest growing
population, several demographic truths apply: They are affluent,
interested in getting the most for their buck and over 55 years old.
   But don't call them senior citizens.
   ``It's instant death,'' said Marion Williams, who developed
Boston Five Cents Savings Bank's program for older customers.
   ``In the early going, some banks made the mistake of pitching
accounts with names like Golden Years,'' said Marsha Blasco of
Florida National Bank Inc.
   Since the early 1980s, banks around the nation have been paying
more attention to their older customers. Government figures project
a 40 percent increase in the number of people over 50 during the
next 10 years as the baby boom generation ages. This group earns
$900 billion dollars a year and controls 75 percent to 80 percent
of financial assets in the marketplace.
   ``Those are numbers that say this is an important segment,''
said Thomas Munsell of Shawmut National Corp. in Hartford, Conn.
``They're there and have big dollars. But they're sophisticated and
elusive.''
   Munsell, who did considerable research in developing the Shawmut
55 program, said the mature bank customer is anything but an easy
sell. They are very well-read and, in some cases, have the time to
look into and carefully compare what banks offer. ``These people
are astute,'' he said.
   Retirement account managers agree the most important point in
wooing the over-55 set is they regard themselves as anything but
``older.''
   ``Most of these people consider themselves about 10 years
younger than they are,'' said Blasco, an assistant vice president.
``They don't feel their age and are much more active than prior
generations.''
   When Barnett Banks of Jacksonville, Fla., in 1982 designed a
package of financial and banking services for older customers it
was an anomaly, said Denise Martin, retirement market manager. Now,
the competition is fierce. ``Everybody is finally realizing that
it's a very important population.''
   And the scramble has just begun, said Michael P. Sullivan, a
Charlotte, N.C., consultant and author of ``Banking on the Mature
Customer.'' ``There's going to be some real warfare out there as
more and more attractive programs are made available to the
seniors. Up till now, most banks have targeted the young urban
professional market. But suddenly they're realizing that 60 to 85
percent of their savings balance is held by people over the age of
50.''
   To appeal to that market, hundreds of banks have adopted
programs like Barnett's Senior Partners program. Specialized
services have become standard.
   Customers over 55 can expect free checking, travelers and
cashiers cheques. Special financial planning guides and accidental
death insurance have become de rigeur. And any bank worth its salt
is liable to have a newsletter addressed to ``the mature banking
customer,'' Martin said.
   In addition to standard banking discounts, marketing directors
said their older customers are interested in travel, entertainment
and medical benefits.
   ``They're no longer acquiring and are instead in the
appreciation stage of life,'' said Williams, an assistant marketing
manager at Boston ive.
   A Florida bank offers older customers free memberships to Disney
World's Magic Years Club and a pocketsized computer card containing
the client's entire medical history.
   But travel perks and dining discounts aren't high on some
seniors' lists, and many seniors banking programs require minimum
balances of as much $10,000, excluding many people on fixed
incomes, said Barbara Hughes, a consumer affairs specialist at the
American Association of Retired Persons.
   ``Our concern is for those who through deregulation and
increased fees have found banking services beyond their budget,''
Hughes said. ``In many places banking services are beyond the reach
of low- or moderate-income people.''
   Between 70 percent and 80 percent of banks offer free checking
with no minimum balance to people over age 60, said Ken McEldowney
of Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based advocacy group. But banks
generally don't advertise them or notify customers they are
eligible, and ``the advertising ends up targeting at the
well-heeled consumers in an attempt to persuade them to open an
account with lots of frills and whistles when in fact such an
account may not be as advantageous as a more stripped-down
account,'' he said.
   AARP has lobbied for increased sensitivity to older consumers'
needs in all sectors, and in particular banks, Hughes said.
``Seeing, hearing and moving may be diffficult for older consumers.
And older consumers still very much like one-on-one-contact with
individuals at the bank tellers.''
   Straight talk about banking service options is another thing
older customers want, she said. Banks have ``devised so many
investment vehicles that it's hard to comparison shop and to know
what you're getting into.''

<HEAD>Congress Moves to Add Barriers to Bias After High Court Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little-noticed Supreme Court ruling making
it easier for employers to limit older workers' fringe benefits has
spurred members of Congress to seek age-discrimination barriers
many thought had been in place for decades.
   Lawmakers and advocates for the elderly are pushing legislation
to nullify the June 23 ruling that bias in benefits such as health
and retirement plans is not automatically banned under the 1967 Age
Discrimination in Employment Act.
   In the wake of the ruling, ``employers are probably going to
start tightening up'' on what fringes they offer to older workers,
said Vicki Gottlich, an attorney with the National Senior Citizens
Law Center. ``Employers may start rethinking how they're going to
provide benefits.''
   However, Doug McDowell, whose Washington law firm, McGuiness and
Williams, represents management in employment cases, said companies
aren't likely to make major cutbacks that would hurt worker morale.
   ``There's a labor shortage in a lot of areas. Instead of laying
off people, they want to keep them. I'm not sure people would want
to stay with an employer who said everyone over age 65 is going to
lose benefits,'' McDowell said.
   The government has long interpreted the age discrimination act
as letting employers limit fringes for older workers only if it
would cost more to offer them the same benefits given younger
employees, for example life insurance.
   But the Supreme Court, in an Ohio case, said the law bans biased
benefit plans only in cases where the disparities are part of an
intent to discriminate in ``some non-fringe-benefit aspect,'' of
employment, such as hiring or firing.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a strong dissent from the 7-2
majority decision, said the ruling ``immunizes virtually all
employee benefit programs from liability'' under the age
discrimination act.
   ``It is difficult to believe that Congress ... intended to
immunize acts of unabashed discrimination against older workers,''
Marshall wrote.
   Horace Deets, executive director of the American Association of
Retired Persons, said that while the ruling got little attention
amid the excitement over long-awaited court decisions on abortion
and flag-burning, it was ``an absolute shocker'' to the aging
community.
   ``For years the assumption has been that benefits are covered
under the age discrminiation act, as would be hiring and firing,''
Deets said. ``This puts older workers at a distinct disadvantage.''
   The decision came in a lawsuit filed by June Betts, who began
working in 1978 as a speech pathologist at the Hamilton County
Board of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilites. When her
work deteriorated, due to Alzheimer's disease, the 61-year-old Ms.
Betts in 1985 was given the choice of unpaid medical leave or
retiring with a standard pension of $158.50 a month.
   Because she was over 60, she was denied a third option of
disability retirement with benefits of $355 a month.
   Lower courts upheld Ms. Betts' contention that it was a
violation of the act to deny disability benefits solely because of
her age, but the Supreme Court said Congress had ``left the
employee benefit battle for another day'' when it enacted the
anti-discrimination law in 1967.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the
age discrimination act, filed a brief supporting Ms. Betts and
stating its belief that the law required ``some sort of cost
justification in order to permit an employer to avoid a charge of
discrimination.''
   The court's ruling to the contrary is under review, and its
impact on cases pending has not been determined, said EEOC
spokeswoman Margaret Fernandez.
   The ruling's biggest impact will be in disability and severance
benefits, which sometimes are designed to convert to pensions at a
certain age or after a specified time, according to Jim Klein of
Towers, Perrin, a New York consulting firm that often represents
employers. But most employers already are accustomed to applying
the act to benefit plans and are unlikely to make big changes
because of the Betts ruling, Klein said.
   Any after-effects of the ruling could well be short-lived, given
widespread interest on Capitol Hill in obviating it.
   Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the
Senate Special Committee on Aging, has introduced legislation to
extend age discrimination barriers to fringe benefits, and Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, also is considering legislative options.
   In the House, Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the Select
Committee on Aging, said he would introduce legislation. ``We in
Congress cannot allow older workers to go unprotected in such a
critical part of the employment relationship as employee benefit
plans.''

   When Chuck Williams retired four years
ago from a career that included three decades as a TV producer and
several stints as a Broadway performer, he planned to play a lot of
golf.
   A few months later, though, he found himself in 16th-century
garb, serenading crowds at the Busch Gardens theme park four days a
week.
   ``I think it's kept me young,'' said Williams, 64, who enjoys
mingling with the crowds and bestowing kisses on female tourists
between shows.
   Park owner Anheuser-Busch is among several local employers who
have taken advantage of the growing number of business and
government retirees settling in planned communities around this
small historic city.
   Colonial Williamsburg, the College of William and Mary and James
City County all have benefited from retirees with decades of
experience willing to work part-time for little or no pay.
   ``What may make it unusual is the retirees here are those in the
upper-income range,'' said John E. McDonald, county budget
director. ``We also see early retirees, retirees in their mid-50s
who are still very active people and are still continuing to look
for challenges.''
   McDonald hired one of those, Ted Bickmok at the helm of a station he
founded, massaging listeners
daily with his gentle yet authoritative and mellifluous voice, a
throwback to an era when radio was king.
   At 68, white-haired and mustachioed, Shoecraft is an engaging
entrepreneur, raconteur, on-air pro and civic-minded world traveler.
   He's also an example for others, though he insists on minimizing
that.
   When Shoecraft started June 1, 1939, just out of Phoenix Union
High School, changing records at KGLU in Safford, he worked 70
hours a week, including the 6 a.m. sign-on to 12:15 a.m. sign-off
on alternating Sundays as record master of ceremonies, ``whatever
that is.'' The pay was $10 a week.
   In those days the dial was less cluttered. There were six
stations on the air in Arizona, compared with more than 180 today.
   ``It was the prime entertainment in those days, and it probably
was fed a lot by the Depression,'' Shoecraft says. ``If you could
get enough to buy a radio, this was your family entertainment, and
it was free.''
   Standard fare included Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and the Kraft Music
Hall, the Firestone Hour, Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony
Orchestra.
   ``The best entertainmment in the whole world, comedy and music
and, it really meant more. To my way of thinking, it's still just
as magnetic if it's done right. Of course, the competition now is
fierce.''
   Shoecraft, self-taught, has met that competition with his own
brand of ``little-town radio'' a comfortable mix of talk,
information, music and general help, plus a large dose of local
news. ``If it's news in Globe, we've got it.''
   The philosophy is simple: interact with listeners.
   Here's the formula:
   _A morning ``Open Line'' call-in show;
   _``The Money Tree,'' offering $20 or more to callers who
correctly answer five true-false questions, like whether President
Truman sold his memoir rights in 1953 to the Saturday Evening Post
(he didn't; they went to Life magazine);
   _``Trading Post,'' a daily swap shop.
   _Requests for work, clothing or other help for local needy
citizens.
   Then there are Larry King, California Angels' baseball and other
sports.
   ``He's been so involved in the community through the radio
station,'' says Sheldon Miller, manager of the Chamber of Commerce.
``He caters to just so many people.''
   Frank B. Healy, a close friend since childhood, says Shoecraft's
``word is as good as his signature.'' But ``he's a poor poker
player.''
   It's often diffficult to get a straight answer from Shoecraft,
Healy says. ``I think I'm the only one who can outjoke him at
times.''
   Shoecraft has lived in Globe since 1943. In 1958, he went on the
air with his own station, KIKO-AM, originally broadcasting from the
lobby of the Copper Hills Hotel. Eventually, he struck a deal with
Inspiration Copper Co. to build a mobile-home park, and moved KIKO
into one. He built stations in Safford and Winslow and sold them,
then in 1979 established KIKO-FM, with the highest FM signal
possible, carrying 80 miles into Phoenix.
   Over the years, he's made the most of turning bad luck into good
fortune.
   For instance, there was the time a hunter shot a telephone line,
jumbling signals so a conversation between two women was broadcast
over KIKO. Shoecraft faced a threat of being sued until he became
friends with one of the women and her husband. And the woman's
sister, Billie, whom he married.
   Shoecraft played piano in a bar, served on the city council and
as vice mayor, and once ran for the state Senate. ``I was soundly
beaten,'' he says.
   He served on the hospital and industrial development boards and
was active in scouting. He and Billie, who died in 1976, raised
three sons: an accountant-developer and noted balloonist, an
attorney and a school administrator.
   He subsequently married Billie's nurse, Ruth.
   Now, Shoecraft is running KIKO a second time. He sold the
stations in 1987 for $1.75 million and bought back the AM station
in June 1988 for $125,000.
   He provided ``a vehicle for people to vent their feelings,
sometimes in anger, sometimes in excitement, sometimes in joy, but
whatever, the people have had an opportunity to be part of that
radio station,'' Miller says.
   One other thing sets Willard Shoecraft a bit apart: Since an
accident when he was 8, he has had no legs.
   It's one of the few things he doesn't talk much about.

   The message today is simple: BEWARE THE
SUMMER SUN!
   Too many people, especially older people, become needlessly ill
because they fail to recognize the potential dangers of the sun and
its heat. However, the two great dangers, heatstroke and skin
cancer, are largely preventable.
   Symptoms of heatstroke occur almost instantly and can be
immediately fatal, while skin cancer develops years after exposure
to the sun's rays.
   If you must be exposed to the heat, drink plenty of water or
fruit and vegetable juice, even if you aren't thirsty. Avoid
alcohol and caffeine. Dress in light-weight, light-colored, loose
clothes. Limit activity in the hottest part of the day and keep
meals simple and light. If they are available, use air conditioners
liberally. Trips to cool places are good alternatives.
   If you are a relative, friend, or neighbor of a person who is
unable to get around you may want to offer transportation.
   Older people are especially vulnerable to heat-related
illnesses. Changes in the body that may affect ability to cope with
heat include inefficient sweat glands, poor circulation and changes
in the skin. Also, some older people have illnesses that cause
weakness or fever which, in turn, affect their ability to cope with
heat. Heart, lung, and kidney diseases are good examples.
   Diseases requiring special diets also may make a person more
vulnerable to heatstroke. People with high blood pressure, for
example, reduce the amount of salt in their diets. Yet this
reduction may increase the risk of heat stress. (A word of caution
_ salt should not be increased nor salt supplements taken without
consent from a physician.)
   Medications like diuretics, sedatives, tranquilizers and certain
heart and blood-pressure drugs may contribute to a body's inability
to regulate internal temperature. But never stop medication or
change a recommended diet without consulting a doctor. Unusually
heavy or underweight people also are at risk, as are those who
drink alcoholic beverages regularly.
   Anyone suspected of suffering a heat-related illness should
receive attention. Victims of heatstroke exhibit a body temperature
of 104 degrees or higher. The pulse may be rapid. Other symptoms
include flushed skin, a faint feeling, confused and bizarre
behavior and combativeness. These symptoms require immediate
emergency medical assistance.
   Heat fatigue and heat exhaustion are milder forms of heat
stress. Should you suspect either illness look for giddiness,
nausea, profuse sweating, and a cold and clammy feeling and take
steps to prevent the condition from worsening.
   First, and perhaps most obvious, the person needs to get out of
the sun and into a cool, preferably air-conditioned place.
Encourage sponging off with cool water or taking a cool bath or
shower and non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated drink.
   Another serious danger associated with the sun and aging is skin
cancer.
   Whether you are 15 or 50 your skin is accumulating sun damage,
including wrinkling, various growths and skin cancers and change in
texture. By following some easy sun-safety tips many skin cancers
can be prevented.
   Don't sunbathe too long. Try to limit exposure between 10 a.m.
and 3 p.m. and get used to the sun gradually. Wear a hat,
long-sleeved shirt, and W-rated (ultraviolet) sunglasses. Use
sunscreens liberally and apply them at least one hour before going
out. Reapply after swimming or sweating. Sunscreens are effective
at SPF (sun protection factor) 15.
   Prolonged exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer. The most
common forms are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and
malignant melanoma.
   Basal cell carcinomas are the most common and rarely harmful to
vital organs. Squamous cell carcinomas are less common but are
potentially harmful because they can grow quickly and spread to
other organs. Malignant melanomas often look like dark, irregular
moles. They can be deadly.
   If you suspect skin cancer see a doctor. Warning signs include a
new mole-type spot or changes in color, size, shape or texture of
an existing one. With early detection and prompt treatment, many
skin cancers can be cured. Even if you have had a benign cancer you
must guard against the dangers of the sun.
   With good, sound judgment and a knowledge of preventive measures
the hot summer months can be safe and fun for everyone.

<HEAD>Plants Don't Care Who You Are; Hard Work Is All That Counts</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: George Bria retired from the AP in 1981 after 40
years that included coverage of World War II from Italy.

<TEXT>
   Plants don't care how old you are. A
rose blushes as sweetly for the 80-year-old gardener as for one 50
years younger. With age, a tennis serve loses its zing and a golf
drive its distance, but your daffodils will dance in the wind as
sprightly as ever.
   Augusta Carter took to gardening before she was 10, helping her
grandmother in the red soil of a Georgia vegetable patch.
   ``I was the only one of the grandchildren she would let in the
garden because I remembered the names of things. I was alway asking
questions. I wanted to know why things grew the way they did.''
   Now 81 and ailing, Augusta still finds the garden a main
pleasure in life. People in Pound Ridge, a country town 50 miles
north of Manhattan, have long thought of Augusta and her lawyer
husband, Ray, 82, as ``Mr. and Mrs. Garden.''
   Most every town has elderly couples like them, who, seeking
beauty and flavor, have put a lifetime into raising flowers and
vegetables with skill and dedication. And many newly retired
seniors are looking to the garden to fill the leisure hours.
   But Augusta warns that a gardener ``has to get grimy and dirty
and enjoy what comes out of real work. If you're one of those
people who are afraid to get your fingernails soiled or broken and
you don't want to put on dirty old jeans and old sneakers and get
out and dig, you're not really a gardener.''
   Ailments keep her from doing as much now. She's ``concentrating
more and more on flowers and herbs.'' But, leaning on her stick,
Augusta helps out at every event put on by the Garden Club, of
which she was once president. She supervises the care of the
library grounds.
   But mostly she likes to look at her perennials renewing
themselves in the spring, like the lavender clematis that has
showed 300 blooms.
   In his youth in Florida, Ray worked as an attorney for the War
Department, but briefly tended a Victory Garden in Mamaroneck, a
suburb of New York City. Augusta remembers his vegetables were so
good that ``he was robbed often; people would come in the middle of
the night and take things.''
   After the war, the Carters moved to a 1737 house on acreage in
Pound Ridge, which since has become a National Landmark.
   Even as Ray commuted daily by train to his law firm in
Manhattan, he became more and more involved in his garden. ``I'd
get up at 4:30 and get my gardening done then. Otherwise I wouldn't
keep abreast of it. There wasn't enough time.''
   Before leaving for his train, Ray would pick a flower for his
buttonhole, and he became known to fellow commuters as the man who
always wore a flower.
   For years now the Carters have been going back South in the
winter to a house, and another garden, in the Florida Keys and
they'll define for you expertly the nuances of southern and
northern horticulture.
   Ray has also been ailing lately and has cut his outdoor work
sharply. But he likes to take you around his Pound Ridge grounds
and point out interesting plants, like his off-season Egyptian
onions. In the vegetable patch, he shows how yearly mulching with
autumn leaves has enriched the soil to a deep, dark brown. His
daughter, Quincy, helped put in the tomatoes this year.
   Keeping up the family tradition, Quincy has also headed the
Garden Club.
   Talking with the Carters in their comfortable sitting room, you
get a sense of the soul of the garden. Augusta appreciates but
doesn't agree with an old saying that people like to garden
``because the plants don't talk back.''
   She thinks plants ``have a lot to say without talking,'' that
they'll let you know by sign language if they need more sun or rain
or a richer soil. She also says, ``It's the care you give a rose
that brings out the better rose.''
   Any wisdom she'd pass on?
   ``You don't have a garden just for yourself. You have it to
share. But you have to be willing to do the work.''

<HEAD>Mom-and-Pop Research Company Builds A Better Safety Cap </HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM LACEKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kids don't think like grownups.
   With that simple premise and a $50,000 grant from the National
Institutes of Health, a mom-and-pop research company has come up
with a child-proof cap it hopes will make life easier for older
Americans.
   The caps designed by Bob and Mary Hunter's Yellowstone
Environmental Science don't rely on an adult's strength or
dexterity. Instead, they require two cognitive skills that children
aged 3 to 5 don't have: Read the directions, then do some things in
a specified sequence, such as push, twist, THEN pull.
   The designs ``were similar to simple combination locks,'' said
Mary Hunter.
   The Hunters recruited 26 adults, aged 60 to 75, from the Bozeman
Senior Center, and 20 3- to 5-year-olds from the Child Development
Center, a preschool associated with Montana State University, to
test three cap designs.
   ``It was a much smaller group than you'd need to come to
definite conclusions, but two of the designs were virtually
child-proof. No children opened them. One child almost 5{ opened
one of the designs,'' Mrs. Hunter said.
   The children seemed familiar with the now-commonplace safety
caps, but were thwarted by the sequence requirements, she said.
Ninety percent of the adults opened the caps and 80 percent rated
them easy or very easy to use.
   A recent Gallup Poll of older Americans found that the No. 1
problem of daily life was opening medicine, the Hunters said.
Safety packaging is optional on prescription drugs, and many older
people, especially arthritics, refuse it.
   One result, said Bob Hunter, is that one of every six children
poisoned by a prescription medicine each year has taken a
grandparent's medication.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is considering a staff
proposal to test packaging for medicines and toxic household
chemicals on elderly people as well as the children it is meant to
protect. People over 65 receive 25 percent of all prescriptions,
but testing uses only 18- to 45-year-olds, Hunter said.
   Owens-Illinois, a $3 billion-a-year packaging manufacturer, has
asked to look at the Hunters' findings.

<HEAD>Computerized Phone Program to Monitor Elderly Living Alone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN PACENTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer that makes up to 100 phone calls an
hour can alleviate one of the fears of elderly people living alone
_ being undiscovered for days after being stricken suddenly at home
by illness.
   ``There is a large percentage of elderly that live alone with a
pre-existing medical conditions and nobody to check on them,''
Youngtown Police Chief Mike Branham said recently, announcing plans
to install the system.
   The service _ R.U.O.K., coined by developer Bruce Johnson for
``Are you OK?'' _ is being installed in the Youngtown, Sun City and
Sun City West suburbs of Phoenix. R.U.O.K. was first installed in
Osage, Iowa, in March 1988 and has been started in about 15 cities,
including in Gulfport, Miss., in July.
   ``It's a real simple system,'' Branham said. ``A computer modem
hooks to a telephone and calls the elderly person. If they don't
answer the phone, the computer re-logs the number and recalls it
eight minutes later.''
   If there is no answer, a computer sends a printout of the
person's name and condition to a police dispatcher, who will send
an officer. The computer dials up to 100 phones an hour and should
be able to serve about 500 people.
   A person may have the computer call any number of times in a
day, Branham said. ``Everyone will get at least one call every 24
hours.''
   Johnson, who attended a news conference kicking off the Gulfport
system, ``If a person can answer the phone, we assume he's OK
enough to call for help. This program is aimed at those who can't
answer.''
   The cost varies. Phoenix-area civic groups raised $7,000 to
start R.U.O.K.; Gulfport police came up with $3,600 for theirs.

<HEAD>Bjorn Borg's Business Nearly Bust, Reports Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The business empire of Bjorn Borg is
being liquidated and could go bankrupt because the retired tennis
star has refused a bid for new working capital, media reports said
Monday.
   Bjorn Borg Enterprises was hit by a cash crisis after Borg
refused a $4.6 million infusion to cover the expansion in Bjorn
Borg Design Group, a fragrance and fashion company, the newspaper
Aftonbladet and the nationa news agency TT said.
   The financing plan was offered by Swedish financier Peter
Gyllenhammar and would have allowed Borg to remain the majority
owner, the reports said. Further details of the plan were not
disclosed.
   The Bjorn Borg company office in Stockholm did not answer the
telephone Monday. Aftonbladet quoted Borg as saying he would not
comment.
   Business partners quoted by Aftonbladet and by TT said Borg had
given ``no explanation'' for his decision to refuse the financing
plan at a board meeting Thursday.
   Aftonbladet and TT said the company board resigned, including
Hakan Frisinger, a former managing director of automaker Volvo AB.
   Borg's partner Lars Skarke, who owns a 25 percent share in the
group, told TT one reason for needing new working capital was brisk
sales. Stig Sjoholm, a lawyer and vice president of Bjorn Borg
Design group, told Aftonbladet turnover had quadrupled in the past
year.
   ``It is possible our expansion has been too rapid on certain
points,'' he said.
   The Monte Carlo-based Bjorn Borg Enterprises owned companies
which designed and marketed a line of quality fashions and
fragrances, and was involved in Swedish real estate.
   Borg, 33, founded his empire on the winnings of a 10-year
professional tennis career, including an unmatched five consecutive
championships at Wimbledon, from 1976 through 1980, and six French
Open crowns.
   By the time he retired from the circuit in 1983, he was
estimated to have amassed $75 million in prizes and endorsements.
He declared his personal wealth in his 1986 tax return as nearly $8
million.

   The stock market moved broadly lower in early
trading today, settling down from Friday's futures and
options-related rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 10.43 to 2,596.93
at 10 a.m. on Wall Street.

<HEAD>Private Sector Asked to Freeze Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private businesses have been asked to
freeze prices for an unspecified period following similar measures
taken by state-run enterprises earlier this month, the Al-Ittihad
weekly reported Monday.
   The weekly, published by the Iraqi federation of chambers of
commerce and industry, said the price freeze was requested in
accordance with the government's inflation-fighting efforts.
   ``Continually rising prices have led to stagnation and halted
the market's expansion,'' Abul Qader Abdul-Latif, the federation's
chairman said. ``Private entrepreneurs have been depicted as greedy
and as hindering development of the national economy.''
   The government's call came just a few days after it raised state
employees' salaries by $80 a month in their first pay hike in more
than 10 years.
   The government also froze prices of goods and services provided
by state-run enterprises for one year from July 1.
   Prices soared last year after a United Nations cease-fire took
effect Aug. 20 in the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. Prices for some foods
doubled recently in a new wave of price increases.
   A pack of 30 eggs that used to cost $6.60 now sells for $12.80.
A two-pound chicken that cost $5.60 now costs $12.16.
   The government is currently subsidizing basic foods such as
flour and cooking oil. It also restricted access to state-run
stores where goods are sold more cheaply to Iraqis working for the
government.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working domestic oil and gas rigs
rose by 10 to total 830 after slipping by five last week, Baker
Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   Prior to last week's decline, the count increased for seven
consecutive weeks. A year ago, the number of working rigs totaled
903, Baker Hughes said.
   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana posted the biggest
gain _ six _ after having the biggest decline last week with nine.
Other states recording gains were Oklahoma and Wyoming, four each;
Colorado, three; and Pennsylvania and Texas, one each.
   Kansas, New Mexico and Ohio each had losses of two and
California declined by one. Michigan and North Dakota were
unchanged from last week.

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc., the subject of intense
takeover speculation for the past two weeks, today announced a
major restructuring program that includes reducing its weapons
business and cutting 4,000 jobs.
   The company said it also planned to repurchase up to 10 million
shares of its common stock on the open market and to sell a
``substantial portion'' of its 50 percent stake in
Yamatake-Honeywell, a Japanese controls maker. Analysts have valued
that holding at nearly $1 billion.
   The sweeping program will result in a 65-cent increase in the
Honeywell's fourth-quarter dividend, to $2.75 a share, and could
include a special cash dividend, said Chairman James J. Renier.
   Renier said he expected the restructuring to improve operating
profits by about $150 million over the next 18 months.
   Honeywell is the leading manufacturer of torpedoes for the U.S.
Navy and also supplies small, medium and large ammunition to the
U.S. Army, Tunheim said.
   Wall Street greeted today's announcement with open arms.
Honeywell jumped $3.37{ to $88.87{ in active late-morning trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, following a delayed opening.
   Renier said the reduction of Honeywell's weapons business is
part of a strategy begun in 1988 to ``concentrate on core controls
businesses that principally serve commercial markets as well as the
market for military and space controls.''
   The reduction will ``proceed over time in a responsible manner
that recognizes the U.S. government's interest in these businesses
so as not to adversely affect national security interests, our
government program obligations, or the value of these businesses to
Honeywell shareholders,'' Renier said.
   The weapons business accounts for about 20 percent of
Honeywell's revenue.
   Kathy Tunheim, a company spokeswoman, would not say whether a
sale of the business is one of the options being considered.
   However, Tunheim said negotiations to sell the company's stake
in Yamatake-Honeywell, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
will begin within a few days. She would not identify potential
buyers. Japanese investors currently own half of the company, she
said.
   Honeywell's restructuring program will include the elimination
of 4,000 jobs worldwide over the next 18 months, including 300
corporate staff positions targeted in a previous announcement.
   Honeywell currently employs about 78,000 workers. Many of the
job cuts will be made through attrition, but layoffs will be
necessary, Tunheim said. The company had announced last month that
it would lay off 300 employees.
   Today's restructuring announcement follows speculation that
Honeywell is a takeover target. Honeywell's stock price has risen
sharply in the last two weeks following published reports that
General Electric Co. was considering acquiring the company.
   The takeover rumors began after the company announced that it
lost $435 million in fiscal 1988.
   Honeywell's second-quarter profit jumped to $74.8 million, or
$1.73 a share, from $31.6 million, or 75 cents a share, in 1988.
   John McManus, a securities analyst with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York, said today's announcement could deter
a takeover attempt, although it won't guarantee independence for
Honeywell.
   ``They are trying to basically boost the stock price to make it
more difficult for someone to take them over,'' McManus said. ``It
will also alleviate some of the large shareholders who have been
pounding on the door. They are doing the things they have to do to
deter a takeover.''

   A weekend of decent rains and cooler temperatures
forced grain and soybean futures lower this morning on the Chicago

   Analysts predicted lower soybean prices today because of the
rains, but the drop in early trading that exceeded 7 cents in some

   Corn prices were depressed by rumors that the Soviet Union would
enter the market. But the Soviets have yet to make an offer.
   The near completion of the wheat harvest and the purchase last
week by Egypt of 200,000 metric tons of wheat from European growers
pushed wheat futures lower.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with the

<HEAD>Quarterly Earnings Up 10 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beckman Corp., the
pharmaceuticals manufacturer, said Monday its second-quarter
earnings rose 20 percent over the same period last year.
   SmithKline Beckman said net income for the quarter was $118.6
million, or 94 cents a share, compared with $98.7 million, or 79
cents a share in the second quarter of 1988.
   The company said sales rose 10 percent to $1.26 billion from
$1.14 billion in the same 1988 quarter. Sales in its clinical
laboratory services, consumer health care and eye and skin care
divisions showed the largest increases.
   The stronger U.S. dollar compared to other currencies undercut
total corporate sales by $31 million for the second quarter, the
company said.
   For the first six months of 1989, Smithkline Beckman said
earnings dropped 6 percent to $248.8 million, or $1.99 a share,
from $265.3 million, or $2.13 a share, in the first half of 1988.
   SmithKline Beckman shareholders are to vote Wednesday on a
proposal to merge with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham. As
part of the merger, Beckman Instruments will be spun off as an
independent company.
   Beckman, a supplier of laboratory instruments and consumer
products for health care, became partially public in 1988.
Currently, 84 percent of Beckman shares are held by SmithKline
Beckman Corp.
   Those shares are to be redistributed as part of the
recapitalization of SmithKline Beckman if approved at Wednesday's
shareholders meeting.
   Quarterly earnings for Beckman, as reported both in Philadelphia
and at Beckman Instruments headquarters in Fullerton, Calif., were
$11.4 million, or 40 cents per share, down from $12.1 million or 42
cents per share last year.
   Beckman sales were $200.5 million, up 3 percent from $194.7
million in the second quarter of 1988.

   Martin Marietta Corp. said Monday its
second-quarter earnings rose 10 percent over last year, mainly due
to increased production of the Titan IV rocket.
   The company said net income increased to $86.9 million, or $1.64
a share, from $81.4 million, or $1.53 a share, in the same period
last year.
   Second-quarter sales totaled $1.43 billion, down from $1.44
billion in the 1988 quarter.
   Earnings for the first half of 1989 were $146 million, or $2.76
a share, on sales of $2.75 billion. That compared to a profit of
$132 million, or $2.49 a share, on sales of $2.74 billion in the
first six months of 1988.
   Norman R. Augustine, Martin Marietta's chairman and chief
executive officer, attributed the strong second quarter to
increased production of the Titan IV launch rocket, which had its
first successful flight in June.

<TEXT>
   Stock prices in London surrendered a portion of
their recent gains Monday as the market experienced a technical
correction after its sharp move forward in recent weeks.
   The market opened weaker and retreated steadily during the day.
Dealers said most of the decline was due to market makers cutting
prices in an effort to provoke buying interest. But traders also
reported pockets of profit-taking.
   One trades said the market was ``calming down'' after the the
$21 billion offer by an investor group led by Anglo-French
financier Sir James Goldsmith for BAT Industries PLC July 11.
   The bid energized the London stock market by prompting
speculation of other takeovers.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down
23.9 points, or 1.05 percent, at 2,259.1, just a shade better than
its session low of 2,258.3. The key index began the day with a
3.9-point drop from Friday's close, then declined steadily.
   Volume was 390.4 million shares, compared with 574.1 million
shares Friday.

<HEAD>Capital Gains: More Than Rich Vs. Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of the economic considerations of a
proposed capital gains tax cut now have become obscured by politics
and reduced to a question: Would a cut be a gift to the rich at the
expense of the poor?
   Some studies say it would be, the reasoning being that most
capital-gain dollars, or financial gains on appreciation of
long-term assets, are earned by the wealthy. Internal Revenue
Service figures document it.
   Those figures show, for instance, that in 1986 the group with
total income of $1 million or more earned more than one-third of
all capital gains. The percentage often has been cited in defense
of the rich vs. poor argument.
   Less often cited are data from the same source showing that
people with medium or low income constitute nearly 18 percent of
capital gains earners, and that they might fare worse than the rich.
   Moreover, says Ron Utt, former deputy director of the Office of
Management and Budget, those figures must be read with a very
serious caveat: that some relatively poor people may become
``rich'' once in their lives.
   Once is enough, however, statistically to catapult them into the
higher brackets.
   Utt, now a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation,
observes that even relatively poor people can be hit hard by
capital gains. Who? An elderly widow selling her home, a parent
selling stock to pay for a child's education.
   It also might be a hard-working citizen who sells a business, or
almost anyone who tediously saved a few thousand dollars in a
mutual fund, or a divorced couple selling a home into which they
had poured hearts and dollars.
   For one year, the year in which they disposed of their assets,
they became rich for tax purposes, forever leaving their imprint on
the national statistics and their own financial well being.
   The tendency to view capital gains, and capital gains taxes, as
affecting only the rich led to obscuring another economic
consideration when the tax was raised from a maximum of 20 percent
to a maximum of 28 percent in 1986.
   That increase did indeed impact the rich; it was, after, all a
40 percent increase. Often overlooked then, and now, is the fact
that under the old rules the taxes of many low and middle-income
taxpayers amounted to only 14 percent. They too jumped to 28
percent, doubling in one legislative swipe.
   That was part of the increase. Because of legislative action at
the state level, or because state tax rates were based on the
federal model, state taxes also rose, some between 100 percent and
200 percent.
   An economic consideration often referred to by supporters of a
capital gains tax cut is the injustice of taxing people on capital
gains income never earned. The tax is applied quite literally to
the inflated value of assets.
   But while taxing people on inflation may be unreasonable, it is
seldom pointed out that the assets involved may have grown more
swiftly because taxes were deferred until sold. That observation
also seems to have been forgotten.
   Important also, is the potential significance of capital gains
taxes for the United States as a global competitor. Capital gains
taxes are not universal; they are rare, restricted mainly to such
industrial giants as the United States _ which has the highest _
Britain, Sweden, Canada and France.
   In a 1987 report, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen pointed
out that West Germany, Belgium, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands
exempted long-term capital gains. Also exempting them were Hong
Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, all on a fast
track to industrial might and competitive power.
   These and many other economic considerations have been
overwhelmed in the heat of the political battle, a battle that
seems to have distilled the important issues to just one.

<HEAD>Champion Shareholders Approve Merger With Cooper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Champion Spark Plug Co. shareholders on Monday
approved the company's $800 million merger with Cooper Industries
Inc.
   Cooper's cash buyout at $21 per share was approved by
shareholders of Toledo, Ohio-based Champion during a special
meeting in Houston.
   Cooper, a diversified maker of commercial and industrial
products, in February outbid Dana Corp., which offered $590 million
in cash and securities, to acquire the spark plug maker.
   Dana, a Toledo-based automotive parts manufacturer, had signed
an agreement to acquire Champion in January. Champion had agreed to
pay Dana $15 million if the buyout fell through.
   In making the bid for Champion, Robert Cizik, Cooper's chairman
and president, said he had no objection to Champion's agreement to
pay Dana.
   Champion, with annual revenue of about $730 million, is the
world's leading manufacturer of spark plugs for all types of
internal combustion engines. It also manufactures Anco windshield
wiper blades and a variety of other fuel system and automotive
maintenance products.
   Houston-based Cooper, with annual revenue of $4.3 billion, is a
diversified, worldwide manufacturer of products for the electrical,
electronic, commercial, industrial, compression and drilling
markets.

<TEXT>
   A Canadian developer appears close to buying the
Sears Tower in a package worth more than $1 billion that could
change the name of the world's tallest building, according to a
published report Monday.
   Crain's Chicago Business reported that Toronto-based Olympia &amp;
York Developments Ltd. wants to buy the 110-story building and sign
British-based publisher Maxwell Communications Corp. as its anchor
tenant.
   ``We have no comment at all,'' Sears spokesman Douglas
Fairweather said. ``That's speculation and we're not commenting on
speculation.''
   Sears' Merchandise Group is currently the tower's anchor tenant,
but Sears is selling the building in a bid to streamline operations.
   The weekly newspaper quoted sources saying the sale could come
within two weeks and force owner Sears, Roebuck and Co. to
relinquish the right to keep its name on the 1,707-foot-high
building.
   According to earlier reports, Sears had insisted the buyer
retain the name of the landmark.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain and moderate
temperatures in large areas of the U.S. growing region weighed
heavily on the market.
   ``The market opened very weak'' and continued that way
throughout the day,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst for Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The favorable growing conditions for this week, with a little
less warm temperatures than predicted, added to the bearish
sentiment,'' Gustafson said.
   He noted that the weakness in soybean and corn prices spilled
over into the wheat pit. Wheat prices also were pressured by the
good pace of the harvest.
   ``Disappointment in the export side of the market also affected
prices,'' Gustafson said.
   At the close, wheat was 6 cents to 7\ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.88{ a bushel; corn was 6
cents to 9{ cents lower with September at $2.30 a bushel; oats were

rose 23.1 percent, including a double-digit increase in operating
income from broadcasting despite a flat performance by its ABC
Television Network.
   Another media concern, Reuters Holdings PLC, said its profit
jumped 34.5 percent in the first six months of the year as it
continued a cost-cutting effort begun after the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   The book publisher Houghton Mifflin Co. said its profit rose 10
percent for the second quarter on a 16 percent revenue increase.
   Capital Cities-ABC, which also has interests in the ESPN cable
network and in book, newspaper and specialty publishing, said it
earned $140.2 million, or $7.83 per share, in the three months
ended July 2 compared with $113.9 million, or $6.78 per share, a
year earlier.
   Revenue rose 6 percent to $1.23 billion in the quarter from
$1.16 billion a year earlier.
   Operating income for the New York-based communications company
rose 8 percent to $264.5 million in the quarter, including a 10
percent increase in broadcasting, 3 percent in publishing and gains
in newspapers, offsetting declines in the specialized publications.
   The ABC Television Networ had no increase in its operating
earnings as increased costs associated with coverage of major news
events and the telelcast of the mini-series ``War &amp; Remembrance''
offset revenue increases.
   In addition to the TV network, Capital Cities-ABC owns eight
television stations, six radio networks and 21 radio stations.
   Earnings in the latest quarter also benefitted from $27.1
million in interest income, up from $7.9 million for the same
period a year ago.
   For the first six months, Capital Cities-ABC had net income of
$222.9 million, or $12.40 a share, up 21 percent from $184.2
million, or $10.93 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue slipped 4.1 percent to $2.35 billion from
$2.45 billion a year earlier, reflecting the inclusion of revenue
from the Winter Olympics coverage in 1988.
   In London, Reuters said its profit came to 85.3 million pounds,
or $132.2 million. The per share increase was 20.6 pence, or 32
cents. The figures compared with 63.4 million pounds, or 15.1 pence
a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue for the half rose 16.3 percent to 548.3 million pounds,
or $849.9 million, from 471.4 million pounds a year earlier.
   As a London-based company, Reuters is not required to report
quarterly results.
   Glen Renfrew, managing director and chief executive of Reuters,
said, ``Reuters' profit growth accelerated in the first half of
1989.''
   He said the company's core products ``maintained their strong
progress despite continued problems in the financial markets.
Substantial improvements were achieved in operating and profit
margins.''
   At the same time, he said cost-cutting steps taken last year
held down the increase in several major categories of discretionary
costs.
   Reuters operates a news service and a number of information
services used by traders and businesses.
   Boston-based Houghton Mifflin said its profit rose to $10.5
million, or 74 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30
compared with $9.6 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $110.4 million from $95.1
million last year.
   Educational publishing sales rose 21 percent in the quarter, led
by sales gains in the school and college divisions. General
publishing sales slipped 9 percent, reflecting lower trade and
reference book sales in comparison with unusually strong sales a
year earlier.
   For the first six months of the year, Houghton Mifflin earned
$749,000, or 5 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $15,000 for
the period last year.
   Six-month revenue rose 14.6 percent to $154 million from $134.4
million.

   Bjorn Borg said Monday he refused an
offer of fresh capital to rescue his struggling fashion business
built on earnings from his 10-year championship tennis career.
   Borg, 33, said he turned down $4.6 million to help Bjorn Borg
Design Group because he was afraid of losing control of his
companies. Borg said he was negotiating other financing to keep his
business afloat.
   ``I remain committed to the business and am in the process of
trying to reorganize the management and corporate structure of the
group,'' Borg said in a statement.
   Bjorn Borg Design Group produces a line of designer fashions,
fragrances, shoes and accessories, and has real estate interests in
Sweden.
   Lars Skarke, who has a 25 percent stake in Borg's companies,
said the group was facing a ``a shortage of liquidity which is
forcing the closure of the group.''
   The company needs an infusion of cash to meet orders and finance
further expansion, Skarke was quoted as saying in the Aftonbladet
daily.
   Borg, the five-time Wimbeldon champion who retired from
professional tennis in 1983, has boasted of his hands-on management
style, making major business decisions on his own.
   Borg turned down an offer of 30 million kronor, or $4.6 million,
by the Mercurius-Group AB to buy into the holding company Bjorn
Borg Enterprises Ltd., headquartered in Monte Carlo.
   Borg said the terms of the offer ``were not suitable to me as
principal shareholder. As proposed to me, it would have meant
surrendering financial control of the group.''
   He said he ``was not satisfied that we had ironed out the
financial problems'' and indicated there were other offers that
also were unacceptable. Borg said the ``cost structure was too high
for the income, notably in Monte Carlo, and I have taken the
appropriate action to remedy this.''
   Borg, who was pursued over the weekend amid reports the company
was going bankrupt and being liquidated, promised a fuller public
report on the group's future ``once negotiations have been
concluded.''
   Borg, who won Wimbledon from 1976-80 and also took six French
Open titles, was estimated to have earned $75 million in prizes and
endorsements when he retired. On his 1986 tax return, Borg placed
his personal wealth at nearly $8 million.
   Borg's financial woes compounded other personal problems,
including a custody battle with his ex-girlfriend Jannike Bjorling
over his 3-year-old son Robin, and plans to marry Italian rock
singer Loredana Berte, which have been frustrated by delays in
obtaining her divorce.
   In February, Borg was treated in a Milan, Italy, hospital after
taking sleeping pills, but he dismissed speculation of a suicide
attempt.

<HEAD>Bankers Trust Reports Flat Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankers Trust New York Corp. reported nearly flat second-quarter
earnings Monday, reflecting an increase in the banking company's
provision for credit losses and higher non-interest expenses.
   Net income for the three months ended June 30 totaled $174.6
million, or $2.14 a share, compared with earnings of $174.1
million, or $2.18 per share, the same time last year.
   For the first six months of this year, Bankers Trust netted
$338.9 million, or $4.16 a share, up 13 percent from $300.1
million, or $3.79 a share, in 1988.
   Chairman Charles S. Sanford Jr. said the company benefited from
a 15 percent increase in non-interest revenue, to $531.2 million,
primarily through trading activities. But he said those factors
were offset mainly by an increase in Bankers Trust's credit-loss
provision and non-interest expenses.
   The provision for credit losses for the second quarter totaled
$65 million, compared with $5 million in last year's quarter. The
provision included $25 million for refinancing the debt of Third
World countries.
   For the year, Bankers Trust's allowance for credit losses was
$1.306 billion, up slightly from $1.305 billion in 1988.
   Net charge-offs of refinancing the debt of developing countries
were $55 million in the second quarter, including $42 million of
Bankers Trust's non-performing medium- and long-term loans to
Argentina, the company said.
   Total non-interest expenses for the second quarter totaled
$444.1 million, up 8 percent over a year ago.

<HEAD>Delaware Court Rules In Favor Of Time-Warner Merger</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs with Paramount dropping bid; PICKS UP 7th

<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Delaware Supreme Court dealt a fatal
blow to Paramount Communications Inc.'s $12.2 billion hostile bid
for Time Inc. today, upholding a lower court ruling allowing Time
to proceed with a $14 billion tender offer for Warner
Communications Inc.
   The ruling by the three-judge panel paves the way for Time to
buy Warner, creating the world's largest communications concern,
Time Warner Inc.
   Paramount responded to the ruling by dropping its $200-a-share
bid, seven weeks after it was announced.
   The court's unanimous ruling, read by Justice Henry Horsey, was
brief: ``We find no error of law by the Court of Chancery.''
   Paramount and some of Time's shareholders had asked the
three-justice panel to overturn a ruling by Chancery Court Judge
William T. Allen. The judge said the proposed Time-Warner deal,
which was announced in March, three months before Paramount
launched its bid, was the result of long-term business planning and
that Paramount and Time's shareholders could not interfere.
   Michael Klein, an attorney for some of the Time shareholders,
said that because it was a unanimous ruling, the decision would not
be appealed to the full state Supreme Court, which has five
justices.
   Paramount said in a statement it was ending its bid for Time but
would continue to try to expand through acquisitions, mergers,
joint ventures or partnerships.
   ``We believe in making bold moves when they are in the best
interest of Paramount Communications shareholders,'' Paramount
Chairman Martin Davis said. ``We have just demonstrated that in our
offer for Time ...''
   Time attorney Robert Joffe said Time would proceed as planned
with its $70 a share tender offer for Warner, which was scheduled
to expire at 5 p.m. EDT.
   The Supreme Court widely had been expected to uphold Allen's
ruling, and the justices' close questioning of the Paramount and
shareholder attorneys during the two-hour hearing indicated they
would rule in Time's favor.
   Investors sold off Time stock as the hearing _ which was
televised live by Cable News Network _ proceeded. The company's
shares were down $1.25 to $137.25 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading after the decision was announced.
   Warner was up $1 to $66.50 a share and Paramount was up 87{
cents to $58.37{ a share.
   At one point in today's hearing, Justice Andrew G.T. Moore asked
of Michael Klein, an attorney for some of Time's biggest
shareholders, whether they were demanding that ``we must hold that
a board is hostage to any person who walks in and makes a bid no
matter what the long-term plans are.''
   Paramount attorney Melvyn Cantor contended today that Delaware
law required the Time board to inquire into Paramount's bid, and
reminded the three-judge panel that the Supreme Court in a previous
case had ``held that the failure to inquire is gross negligence.''
   Stuart Savett, representing some of the shareholders, accused
the Time board of passively sitting by while company management
used the Warner deal to entrench itself.
   The justices asked Joffe, the Time attorney, why the $70 a share
tender offer for Warner _ which replaced an earlier stock-swap
merger plan _ was not submitted to a vote by Time shareholders at
the company's annual meeting in June.
   Joffe said a vote was not required because the deal did not
involve the issuing of new Time stock. Furthermore, he said, after
Paramount launched its bid on June 6, the market for Time stock was
in disarray and the price of the shares was gyrating.
   ``This was hardly the situation to have an unimpassioned
evaluation of future value and get a fair vote,'' he said.
   Joffe contended Time's plans to merge with Warner would give
shareholders greater value in the long term than Paramount's $200 a
share offer.
   In its tender off for Warner, Time will pay $70 per share in
cash for half of Warner's 200 million outstanding shares.
   Time will later exchange $70 in a combination of cash and
securities for the remaining shares in what is called the deal's
``back end.'' The back end could take several months to complete.
   Paramount argued in a brief filed with the Supreme Court last
week that Allen's decision allowed the Time board to proceed with
the merger with Warner although the deal was economically inferior
to the Paramount offer and therefore detrimental to Time
shareholders.
   Paramount contended that Allen's ruling would allow directors to
reject any offers if they could point to some long-term corporate
strategy.
   Time, in its brief, defended the right of its directors to
determine the company's future course, and said previous Delaware
Supreme Court cases allow a board to refuse to consider offers that
threaten long-term plans.
   The media giant argued that its long-term strategy should not be
instantly negated by the launching of a hostile tender offer.
   Both companies claimed that the Delaware Supreme Court's 1985
ruling in a case involving Unocal Corp. and takeover strategist T.
Boone Pickens Jr. supported their arguments. That decision was
written by Justice Andrew G.T. Moore, one of the three jurists who
had been scheduled to hear the Time case.
   Allen's decision effectively gave corporate directors leeway in
rejecting offers and in setting a course for their companies. There
was widespread speculation prior to the Supreme Court hearing today
that an overturned decision would radically change the climate for
friendly mergers in the United States.
   Many of the biggest U.S. corporations are incorporated in
Delaware and subject to its laws, and other states have modeled
their statutes after Delaware's.
   Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported today that about
500 Warner executives and employees would be paid a total of about
$677 million under stock, option and bonus plans if the deal with
Warner goes through.
   The Journal said the payments _ disclosed in minutes of a Warner
board meeting June 15 _ amounted to the largest compensation
package for employees of a company involved in a takeover.
   Warner Chairman Steven Ross would receive $193 million in
payments and would also receive options on 1.8 million Time Warner
shares, the Journal said.

<HEAD>Success Of Mexico Debt Plan Hinges On Banks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Will be topped following late-afternoon administration briefing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A refinancing agreement between Mexico and its
creditor banks offers a glimmer of hope to the debt-strapped Third
World, but success of the plan hinges on how far the banks are
willing to go, government officials and private bankers said Monday.
   The administration, which provided a final push over the weekend
to get the agreement, hailed the package as a landmark success for
its debt-reduction initiative, unveiled by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady on March 10.
   However, the banks that will implement the plan were more
reserved in their enthusiasm, with many contending that it was too
soon to say how much debt relief they will provide to Mexico
because they were still examining the fine print of the agreement.
   ``At the moment we're exploring our options,'' Fraser Seitel, a
spokesman for Chase Manhattan Corp., said in a typical comment.
``We're looking at the entire (Third World) debt package.''
   The Bush administration hopes to use the Mexican agreement to
set a precedent that will facilitate debt relief in other
countries, with Venezuela and the Philippines considered the two
leading candidates to follow Mexico's lead.
   The administration has made debt reduction a key component of
its foreign policy, believing that the only way to ensure the
survival of emerging democracies in Latin America is to reverse the
decade-long slide in living standards caused by the crushing $1.3
trillion Third World debt burden.
   The Brady plan for debt relief is seeking to slash this debt by
establishing incentives to get commerical banks to voluntarily
forgive a portion of the loans.
   However, banking analysts said it was unclear whether the
incentives being offered in the Mexican package were sufficient to
trigger a substantial writedown of the debt.
   In the case of Mexico, the debt-reduction package provides the
commercial banks with three options.
   On the debt relief side, they can cut 35 percent off the face
value of the current loans or they can agree to reduce interest
rates to 6.25 percent, down from about 10 percent currently.
   Banks also have the option of simply providing new loans.
   The administration estimated that the various options could save
Mexico about $1.5 billion annually off the $5 billion to $5.5
billion it must pay to service its $54 billion in commercial bank
debt.
   However, the administration stressed that this was a rough
estimate and would vary depending on individual decisions made by
the 500 commercial banks located in the United States, Japan and
Europe that hold the Mexican debt.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and a leading congressional expert
on Third World debt, said that the Mexican agreement appeared
seriously flawed because it did not provide enough incentives for
banks to opt for the two debt reduction options rather than simply
piling on new debt.
   ``A lot of the banks, without the necessary carrots or sticks,
are going to stick with the familiar (approach of supplying) new
money to pay old debt,'' Schumer said.
   Schumer said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the
past seven years. Since 1982 when the debt crisis first erupted,
Third World debt has more than doubled from $600 billion to the
current $1.3 trillion.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., said the Mexican agreement did not
represent any ``long-lasting breakthrough in Mexico's debt
situation.'' He said while the amount of debt-reduction was likely
to be small, Mexico would benefit in the next couple of years with
an infusion of new money to get its economy started again.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said that the
administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as they
could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to get
an agreement.
   ``It looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get
something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work,''
she said. ``It is a surface agreement that allows the
administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered
questions.''
   The administration had hoped that President Bush would be able
to present a completed Mexican package during the seven-nation
economic summit last week in Paris.
   When that deadline was missed, Brady stepped up his lobbying
efforts. He brought the bankers and Mexican negotiators to
Washington over the weekend for meetings at the Treasury, which
were also attended by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   After two days of discussions at the U.S. Treasury, final
agreement was reached late Sunday, in time for Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari to announce the breakthrough during a
televised broadcast, saying the proposal would answer the ``the cry
of Mexicans to return to growth.''

<HEAD>Ferruzzi Calls for Study of CBOT Operations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferruzzi Group on Monday called for a study of
Chicago Board of Trade operations, in a followup of the soybean
processor's criticism of the exchange's emergency order that
required traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures
contracts.
   David H. Swanson, president of Central Soya Co. and a member of
Ferruzzi's executive committee, said the emergency order
illustrated that the exchange had failed to keep up with the global
expansion of commodities trading.
   He said a study of the CBOT should look at its grain delivery
system, regulations, market stability, committee structure and
market trends. Swanson said such a study should be undertaken by a
group made up of soybean farmers, processors and others with a
stake in the soybean market.
   ``The agricultural market is becoming truly global in nature.
More than ever, it requires a strong and predictable Chicago Board
of Trade,'' Swanson said at a news conference.
   ``As it stands now, it is open to question whether the market is
serving that function.''
   The Board of Trade on July 11 ordered Ferruzzi Group _ part of
the Italian grain conglomerate Ferruzzi Fianziaria SpA _ and other
major traders to liquidate contracts for July delivery or sale of
millions of bushels of soybeans.
   That decision touched off wild swings in soybean prices and the
exchange's action has been widely questioned by farm groups.
   CBOT officials said the exchange was worried that soybean
supplies were insufficient for meeting large holdings of contracts
for July delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading in that
contract.
   Swanson said Monday that Ferruzzi was holding contracts for
delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans in July. He said those
holdings were built up because of concerns Ferruzzi might not be
able to fill export orders because of the reduction in soybean
supplies due to the 1988 drought.
   ``It is both incredible and unacceptable that a market with
international authority and, indeed, global responsibility, can be
in a crisis over 20 million bushels of beans,'' he said.
   The Chicago Board of Trade refused to comment on Ferruzzi's call
for the study. However, a CBOT spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the exchange conducts internal reviews on a regular
basis.
   ``We have an entire department, the Department of Economic
Analysis and Planning, that reviews the market on a regular
basis,'' said the spokesman. ``It adjusts contracts if they need
adjusting.''
   Swanson said that despite the global nature of the soybean
market, the number of participants had declined.
   ``With fewer but larger players, hedging needs of the major
firms have increased dramatically,'' he said. ``Do the CBOT's
operating practices accommodate this changed market?''
   Swanson also said a study should look into whether options have
reduced futures trading and increased price volatility.
   Futures are contracts for the delivery of a specified amount of
a commodity, such as soybeans, at a future time for a specific
price. Options give a speculator the option to buy or sell futures
contracts at a specific price during a certain period of time.
   ``Options are the preferred instrument of many farmers,'' the
CBOT spokesman said. ``When they enter to an options agreement, it
puts a floor on the price. But they are free to take a better price
should it occur.''

<HEAD>Profits Drop To A Third Of Last Year's Net At Unisys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp.'s earnings fell 67 percent in
the latest quarter in spite of an 8 percent increase in revenue,
the computer and defense contracting company said.
   Unisys Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal attributed the sharp
earnings drop to the expense of cutting inventories, pricing
pressures from competitors, and the temporary suspension of its
defense business by the Pentagon. Also, the rise in the dollar
decreased the dollar value of sales made in foreign currencies.
   Net income was $53.6 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of
$2.57 billion, for the April-to-June period, compared to $162.3
million, or 78 cents a share assuming full dilution, in the similar
1988 period. Revenue grew to $2.57 billion from $2.39 billion a
year earlier.
   For the first half of this year, Unisys recorded a loss of $25.1
million in contrast to a profit of $311.6 million, or $1.60 a share
assuming full dilution, in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the
first six months this year was $4.78 billion, up narrowly from
$4.76 billion in 1988.
   Three former units of Sperry Corp. were temporarily suspended
from bidding on Navy contracts from March 15 through June 23, 1989.
   The suspension stemmed from a federal investigation into
government contract bidding procedures. Two former employees
pleaded guilty to bribery and illegal political donations charges.
   Unisys said the incidents occurred before Sperry and Burroughs
Corp. merged and became known as Unisys, but agreed to institute a
company ethics program when the contract bidding suspension came to
an end. Unisys is rated the nation's 15th largest defense
contractor and last year received $1.4 billion in contracts from
the Pentagon.

   Union Carbide Corp. on Monday reported a
slight drop in second-quarter earnings despite a 7 percent increase
in sales.
   Second-quarter earnings were $186 million, or $1.33 per share,
on sales of $2.28 billion, compared to earnings of $187 million, or
$1.39 per share, on sales of $2.1 billion for the same period a
year ago.
   Sales rose because of an increase in worldwide prices for
ethylene glycol, but earnings were down due to an oversupply of
polyethlylene, the company said.
   For the first six months of 1989, Union Carbide reported net
income of $387 million, or $2.76 a share, compared to $288 million,
or $2.14 a share, in the first half of last year.
   Revenue during the first six months were $4.5 billion, up from
$4 billion in 1988.
   Union Carbide said all of its industry segments reported
second-quarter sales increases. The segments include chemicals and
plastics, industrial gases and carbon products.

   Stock prices pulled back today, reined in by
uncertainty about the chances for lower interest rates anytime soon.
   The stock market moved broadly lower from the opening bell and
various market measures finished near their worst levels of the
session after an afternoon rebound ran out of steam.
   Wall Street analysts had anticipated today's selloff.
   Much of the force behind Friday's nearly 32-point surge in the
Dow Jones industrial average came from trading strategies tied to
the expiration of July stock-related futures and options.
   With the conclusion of trading in those contracts, a major
buying motivation disappeared.
   ``A lot of last week's activity was predicated on the futures
and options expirations,'' said Eugene Peroni, director of
technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
   Attention now has returned to the interest rate outlook.
Financial markets have been building up their hopes for the Federal
Reserve Board to make a significant move toward a more generous
credit policy but so far they have been disappointed.
   ``The market must now consider that the Fed and the major
commercial banks have not acted as aggressively as was hoped,''
said Peroni.
   Earlier this month when Chase Manhattan Bank cut its prime
lending rate to 10{ percent from 11 percent, it was widely assumed
that its competitors would follow suit. But other major banks have
demurred.
   Peroni said he thinks the Fed will continue to ease its hold on
credit, but will do so in gradual, careful steps as it assesses the
economy's condition.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Monday a
previously announced restructuring plan would reduce its net profit
by about $225 million in the second quarter.
   Kodak also said its operating results, apart from the
restructuring, were hurt by the ``artificially high value of the
U.S. dollar'' and the absence of expected efficiencies in
manufacturing.
   Kodak Chairman Colby Chandler said the shortfall in operating
results was ``very disappointing'' and said the company would take
strong steps to address the situation, diclosing a plan in the near
future.
   As for the restructuring charge, he said, ``This should be seen
in a positive light. We are paying now for superior performance in
1990 and beyond.''
   After announcing a 23 percent slide in first-quarter profit,
Kodak said it would consolidate its photofinishing and consumer
photography operations, steps that could cost hundreds of jobs.
   The $225 million charge will cover the cost of special
separation payments to outgoing employees as well as the expense of
writing off the book value of equipment, materials and goodwill.
   ``It was no surprise. They had mentioned the $200 million figure
before,'' said Regina Wiedenski of Adams, Harkness in Boston. ``But
there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the company.''
   Ms. Wiedenski said Kodak watchers are waiting for details of the
company's restructuring plans and more information about divisions
that incurred losses during the quarter.
   Kodak will announce the second-quarter results on Aug. 1.
   Last year, Kodak reported sales of $17 billion and net earnings
of $1.4 billion.

   Manville Corp., the building products company,
said Monday its second-quarter profits more than doubled from the
same period a year ago, reflecting a strong performance by its
paper business.
   Manville, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings
last year, reported net income of $66.39 million, or 55 cents a
share, compared with $33.08 million, or 28 cents per share, in the
same 1988 period.
   Second-quarter sales were $564.6 million, 7 percent higher than
$526.7 million last year.
   Tom Stephens, Manville president and chief executive officer,
credited the company's prosperous paper business for the increased
earnings.
   For the first six months, net income totaled $103.75 million, or
80 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $38.12 million
during the first six months of 1988.
   Net sales for the first half were $1.07 billion, up from $994.2
million a year earlier, the company said.
   Manville is an international manufacturing and natural resources
company. Its products include paper and wood products, fiber glass,
roofing systems and minerals.
   Manville employs more than 18,000 people at 60 facilities and

   The dollar fell against European currencies
Monday but rose against the Japanese yen, which was hurt somewhat
by political instability in Japan.
   The yen lost some ground after the defeat of Japan's Liberal
Democratic Party in Sunday's parliamentary election and Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno's announcement that he would resign.
   Most of the money flowing out of yen went into European
currencies, particularly the West German mark, dealers said. The
dollar benefited less because of uncertainty about the future of
U.S. interest rates, they said.
   After climbing to nearly 1.92 West German marks in overseas
trading, the dollar ended the U.S. trading day below 1.90 marks.
   ``There wasn't a great deal of rhyme or reason to the dollar,''
said John McCarthy, chief dealer at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New
York.
   As for the Japanese yen, he predicted, ``Until we see some kind
of political resolution it's going to continue to be weak.''
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold bullion was bid at $372.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
from $372.25 late Friday.
   In spite of the dramatic political news, the yen's decline was
slight. In Tokyo it actually rose against the dollar compared to
Friday's levels. The dollar fell 0.20 yen in Tokyo to a closing
141.95 yen. Later, in London, it rose to 142.40 yen. In New York it
rose to 142.55 yen from 141.85 on Friday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6185, unchanged
from late Friday. In New York the pound rose against the dollar to
$1.6260 from $1.6187.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Friday's
rates included: 1.8970 West German marks, down from 1.9095; 1.6360
Swiss francs, down from 1.6485; 1.1887 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1879; 6.4275 French francs, down from 6.4750; and 1,369 Italian
lire, down from 1,378.3.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday:
1.9085 West German marks, up from 1.9055; 1.6440 Swiss francs, down
from 1.6455; 6.4600 French francs, up from 6.4460; 2.1490 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1350; 1,374.75 Italian lire, up from 1,371.50;
1.1890 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1880.
   Gold bullion rose in thin London trading to a late bid price of
$372.25 a troy ounce, down from $371.50 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to $371.50 bid from $372 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 10 cents to close at a bid
$372.99.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $373.40 an ounce from $372.40 on Friday.
   Silver bullion eased in London to $5.20 a troy ounce from $5.21
bid late Friday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose to $5.202 an ounce from $5.186 on Friday.

   The stock market moved broadly lower in light
activity Monday as traders lacked a compelling reason to buy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed at 2,584.98, a
loss of 22.38, which erased much of Friday's nearly 32-point gain.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 942 down, 532 up and
507 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.26 million
shares, down from 174.88 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 166.21 million shares.
   The stock market headed down from the opening bell and various
market measures finished near their lowest levels of the session
after an afternoon rebound ran out of steam.
   Wall Street analysts had anticipated the selloff.
   Much of the force behind Friday's surge in the Dow Jones
industrial average came from trading strategies tied to the
expiration of July stock-related futures and options.
   With the conclusion of trading in those contracts, a major
buying motivation disappeared.
   ``A lot of last week's activity was predicated on the futures
and options expirations,'' said Eugene Peroni, director of
technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
   Attention now has returned to the interest rate outlook.
Financial markets have been building up their hopes for the Federal

credit policy but so far they have been disappointed.
   ``The market must now consider that the Fed and the major

said Peroni.
   Earlier this month when Chase Manhattan Bank cut its prime
lending rate to 10{ percent from 11 percent, it was widely assumed
that its competitors would follow suit. But other major banks have
demurred.
   Among the stocks bucking the downtrend were Honeywell, which
climbed 3~ to 89], a 52-week high. The company, which has been
mentioned lately as a possible takeover target, announced a major
restructuring program that includes buying back about 10 million
shares of its common stock and selling a substantial portion of its
stake in Yamatake-Honeywell.
   Warner Communications also finished on the plus side and was the
most heavily traded NYSE-listed stock, as more than 4.7 million
shares changed hands. Warner rose 1| to 67[ after the Delaware
Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling allowing Time to proceed
with its $14 billion tender offer for Warner. Time fell 1 to 137{.
   Paramount Communications, which dropped its $12.2 billion
hostile bid for Time after the court's ruling, rose 1~ to 59].
   Losers among the blue chips included McDonalds, which sank 2] to
29[. Securities analysts were unimpressed by the fast-food
restaurant company's second-quarter earnings.
   Also contributing to the decline in the Dow Jones industrial
average was Eastman Kodak, which dropped ~ to 47~. The company said
its second-quarter earnings will be reduced by about $225 million
due to a previously announced restructuring.
   Exxon lost 1|, falling to 45[. Its second-quarter income plunged
more than $1 billion due to costs associated with the Alaskan oil
spill.
   Among stocks mentioned recently as possible takeover candidates,
Holiday Corp. jumped 3} to a 52-week high of 62{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $21.52 billion, or 0.65
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
declined 1.12 to 186.03.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.93 to 382.38, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index finished at 333.67, off 2.23.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market went
down 3.31 to 445.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 369.82, off 1.46.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Monday hailed the
new Mexican debt-reduction package as a breakthrough for its Third
World debt strategy, but others were decidedly less enthusiastic.
   Several members of Congress and private bankers said they
believed the final agreement with Mexico offered a glimmer of hope
for the debt-strapped Third World, but they said the success of the
plan hinged on how far commercial banks would ultimately be willing
to go.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, briefing reporters Monday,
labeled the agreement between Mexico and its commercial banks,
reached late Sunday night, as a landmark agreement he said would
establish a precedent to provide debt relief for other Third World
countries, such as Venezuela, the Philippines and Costa Rica.
   Mexico had been seen as the key test case for the
administration's effort to reduce the burden of Third World debt, a
strategy Brady unveiled March 10.
   Brady said the agreement, if fully implemented by the commercial
banks, would shave Mexico's annual interest rate payments by $1.5
billion, down about one-third from the current $5 billiion to $5.5
billion the country is paying on its commercial bank debt of $54
billion.
   In addition, Brady said that over four years, the amount of
Mexico's outstanding debt will be reduced by $10 billion to $12
billion from where it would have been had the deal not been struck.
   ``This is a fantastic change in circumstances,'' Brady said,
although he conceded that the ultimate shape of the debt-relief
package will depend on the willingness of commercial banks to
participate.
   For their part, the commercial banks that hold Mexico's debt
were more reserved, with many contending that it was too soon to
say how much debt relief they will provide to Mexico because they
were still examining the fine print of the agreement.
   ``At the moment, we're exploring our options,'' Fraser Seitel, a
spokesman for Chase Manhattan Corp., said in a typical comment.
``We're looking at the entire (Third World) debt package.''
   The administration has made debt reduction a key component of
its foreign policy, believing that the only way to insure the
survival of emerging democracies in Latin America is to find a way
to reverse the decade-long slide in living standards caused by the
crushing $1.3 trillion Third World debt burden.
   The Brady plan for debt relief seeks to slash this debt by
establishing incentives to get commerical banks to voluntarily
forgive a portion of the loans.
   Banking analysts said it was unclear, however, whether the
incentives being offered in the Mexican package were sufficient to
trigger a substantial writedown of the debt by the 500 banks in the
United States, Japan and Europe that hold the loans.
   In the case of Mexico, the debt-reduction package provides the
commercial banks with three options.
   On the debt-relief side, the banks can cut 35 percent off the
face value of the current loans or they can agree to reduce
interest rates to 6.25 percent, down from about 10 percent
currently.
   Banks also have the option of simply providing new loans.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and a leading congressional expert
on Third World debt, said that the Mexican agreement appeared
seriously flawed because it did not provide enough incentives for
banks to opt for the two debt-reduction options rather than simply
piling on new debt.
   ``A lot of the banks, without the necessary carrots or sticks,
are going to stick with the familiar (approach of supplying) new
money to pay old debt,'' Schumer said.
   Schumer said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the
last seven years. Since 1982, when the debt crisis first erupted,
Third World debt has more than doubled from $600 billion to $1.3
trillion.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., said the Mexican agreement did not
represent any ``long-lasting breakthrough in Mexico's debt
situation.'' He said that, while the amount of debt-reduction was
likely to be small, Mexico would benefit in the next couple of
years with an infusion of money to get its economy started again.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc., said that
the administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as
it could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to
get an agreement.
   ``It looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get
something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work,''
she said. ``It is a surface agreement that allows the
administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered
questions.''
   The administration had hoped that President Bush would be able
to present a completed Mexican package during the seven-nation
economic summit last week in Paris.
   When that deadline was missed, Brady stepped up his lobbying
efforts. He brought the bankers and Mexican negotiators to
Washington over the weekend for meetings at the Treasury, which
were also attended by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   After two days of discussions at the Treasury, final agreement
was reached late Sunday, in time for Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari to announce the breakthrough during a televised
broadcast, saying the proposal would answer the ``the cry of
Mexicans to return to growth.''

<TEXT>
   Supercomputer rivals Cray Research Inc. and
Hitachi Ltd. on Monday confirmed that they have agreed to license
their patents to each other freely, but Cray said the pact does not
allow for joint marketing or sharing of trade secrets.
   Previous press reports were mistaken in saying the pact would
allow the two compaies to share information not yet patented, said
John Swenson, a spokesman for Minneapolis-based Cray.
   Hitachi issued a statement to confirm the existence of the
cross-licensing agreement but a spokesman in New York declined
further comment.
   Swenson said such agreements are customary in the computer
industry. But he said Hitachi is the first Japanese company to sign
such an agreement with Cray. Convex Computers of Richardson, Texas,
and Supertek Computers of California have similar agreements with
Cray, Swenson said.
   ``The agreement gives each company freedom to pursue designs
without having to be concerned about accidental design overlaps
involving a patent held by the other company,'' Swenson said. ``If
we should stumble onto one another's technology, we've agreed not
to litigate.''
   The Kyodo News Service of Japan, Japan Broadcasting Corp. and
the nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported earlier
that the agreement would enable Hitachi to obtain unpatented
technology from Cray, which has more experience in supercomputers.
The reports quoted unidentified ``industry sources.''
   Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former Commerce Department trade
negotiator, said deals between high technology firms in the U.S.
and Japan draw the attention of the U.S. government officials
because they have been using taxpayer money to build up American
technology.
   Prestowitz, author of ``Trading Places,'' a book that advocates
U.S. industrial policy to preserve American technology, said he has
his ``eyebrows raised'' over the Cray-Hitachi deal.
   ``I wonder what lies behind it,'' he said, ``particularly why
they chose Hitachi.''
   Prestowitz said the Japanese have benefited from an imbalanced
flow of information between the two countries.
   ``If Cray gets more information than they give, more power to
them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Plunge as Demand Weakens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices declined sharply Monday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on indications that demand for crude oil
products is declining while supplies remain high.
   On other markets, copper prices were sharply higher, grain and
soybean futures fell, livestock and pork prices finished mixed and
precious metals were up slightly.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents to 77 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in September at $18.74 a
barrel; heating oil was 1.47 cents to 1.96 cents lower with August
at 49.70 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.31 cents to 1.39
cents lower with August at 53.16 cents a gallon.
   ``A lot of selling was caused by reduced concern over the
availability of gas oil supplies out of the Soviet Union,'' said
James Ritterbusch, and analyst with Carson Petroleum Co. in Chicago.
   The easing of the coal strike in the Soviet Union was expected
to increase the availability of European energy products, analysts
said.
   Gasoline prices plunged as demand for the fuel declines in the
United States. Analysts said demand dropped 2.5 percent in the
first half of 1989.
   The market was also influenced by news that workers in the North
Sea oil field are calling off a work stoppage and expectations that
Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute report on oil stocks will
show increased supplies.
   Copper prices rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange on
news that copper stocks in London Metal Exchange-approved
warehouses declined 3,725 metric tons.
   Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
in New York, said most traders expected an increase of about 5,000
metric tons in the London stocks because of production increases
and a slowing economy.
   Terrorist attacks against producers in Peru and a state of
emergency on Bougainville Island in Papua New Guinea, site of a
large copper mining operations, also have prompted worries over
supplies.
   Copper prices were 4.10 cents to 5.35 cents higher, with July at
$1.142 a pound.
   Gold and silver prices traded within a narrow range on the
Comex, with prices getting a minor boost from a weaker dollar,
Sloane said.
   Gold was 90 cents to $1 higher with July at $373.40 a troy
ounce; silver was .80 cent to 1.6 cents higher, with July at $5.202
a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade as rain and moderate temperatures in large areas of
the growing region weighed heavily on the market.
   ``The favorable growing conditions for this week, with a little
less warm temperatures than predicted, added to the bearish
sentiment,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst for Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. in Chicago. ``Disappointment in the export side of the
market also affected prices.''
   Wheat was 6 cents to 7\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.88{ a bushel; corn was 6 cents to 9\
cents lower with September at $2.30} a bushel; oats were 5 cents to
7 cents lower with September at $1.43 a bushel; soybeans were 12
cents to 23\ cents lower with August at $6.61} a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed in trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange as concern over high stocks of frozen pork
bellies _ the source of bacon _ weighed on meat futures. Cattle
prices were affected by concern over sluggish retail beef demand.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .23 cent higher with August
at 72.60 a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .55 cent higher
with August at 83.90 a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with August at 45.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.15 cent lower to 1.03 cents higher with July at 28.92 a pound.

   Oil futures prices fell sharply Monday, resuming
a downward pattern begun last week.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, dropped
77 cents to settle at $18.74 a barrel. The September contract fell
17 cents on Friday, the first trading day for that contract.
   The October contract lost 74 cents to $18.45 while subsequent
months posted slightly smaller losses.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the September
contract of unleaded gasoline slid 1.36 cents to 53.16 cents a
gallon and heating oil for August delivery lost 1.70 cents to close
at 49.59 a barrel.
   Contracts for gasoline and heating oil scheduled for delivery
later in the year posted similar declines.
   Analysts said technical and other factors contributed to the
market's decline.
   ``This weakness started coming into the market last week and we
made new lows on Friday,'' said Ed Ryan, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. ``We expected a follow-through today.''
   Reports of a possible end to the coal strike in the Soviet Union
also impacted prices, said John H. O'Connell, energy analyst with
Refco Inc.
   ``There is no longer a fear that the strike could spread to the
oil sector of the (Russian) economy,'' O'Connell said. The Soviet
Union is the world's largest oil producer.
   A report Monday in an industry trade publication also suggested
that Kuwait is increasing production, helping to weaken prices
further, O'Connell said.

   Goldome bank, the thrift institution in the
midst of a major restructuring under new leadership, on Monday
reported a record $225 million second-quarter loss.
   Goldome said changes in its investment portfolio, the sale of
several business units, writedowns on non-performing assets and
layoffs accounted for more than two-thirds of the loss. The rest
came from continuing operations.
   Thomas Cooper, Goldome president and chief operating officer,
said: ``Some losses are losses and some are investments. ... These
losses will actually save the company in coming quarters.''
   It was the seventh consecutive quarterly loss for the company,
one of the nation's largest savings and loan institutions. Goldome
lost $19.5 million in the second quarter a year ago.
   For the second quarter this year, net interest income was $22
million, compared to $50.7 million a year ago, primarily as a
result of higher interest rates, the bank said. Operating expenses
were $178 million, compared to $102 million last year.
   Cooper, a former president of Bank of America, said in April
when he took over as head of Goldome that he intended to turn the
bank into a ``customer-driven organization.''
   Goldome immediately began selling off divisions not related to
the company's traditional mortgage markets and announced a plan to
trim employment by 20 percent.
   As part of the restructuring, Goldome reported the sale of $1.4
billion of high-risk and junk bond investments at a cost of more
than $55 million; the reduction of $48 million in real estate and
non-accrual loans; and layoffs and a hiring freeze that trimmed
payroll costs by $19 million.
   Cooper said the moves will ``serve as a platform for our return
to profitability.''
   Goldome, with $14 billion in assets, operates in two dozen
states.

   Microsoft Corp. said Monday its profit
rose 51 percent in its fourth fiscal quarter as revenue rose 29
percent from a year earlier.
   The personal computer software company said earnings rose to
$45.4 million, or 80 cents a share, from $30 million, or 54 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $220.2 million from $170.5
million.
   For its full fiscal year, Microsoft reported a 38 percent
increase in net earnings to $170.5 million, or $3.03 per share,
from $123.9 million, or $2.22 per share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 36 percent to $803.5 million from $590.8 million.
   ``These results represent strength across all channels of
distribution and in all product groups,'' said Jon Shirley,
president and chief operating officer.
   Shirley said international operations were particularly strong,
generating 55 percent of revenues in fiscal 1989. Overseas
operations represented 48 percent of 1988 revenues.
   A strong fourth quarter was aided by shipments of the latest
versions of Microsoft Word for both the IBM PC and the Apple
Macintosh, the company said.

   Capital Cities-ABC Video Enterprises Inc. said
Monday it had acquired a minority interest in In-Store Advertising
Inc., which has developed an electronic billboard system that is in
about 1,000 grocery stores.
   Capital Cities officials declined to disclose how large an
interest they were buying in the privately-held New York-based
concern or how much they had invested.
   In-Store Advertising has developed electronic billboards that
are installed over store aisles and deliver promotional messages
about various products to shopers as they are deciding what brands
to buy.
   Bruce Maggin, executive vice president of the video enterprises
unit, said the investment continues Capital Cities' strategy of
participating ``in a broad spectrum of media activities created by
the new communications technologies.''
   He said it would give his company another vehicle for promoting
its television and cable programming, and said the billboards could
also fit into the marketing strategies of national advertisers who
appear on ABC programs.

   The plan for reducing Mexico's foreign debt
removes an obstacle to growth but does not guarantee recovery,
economists said Monday.
   ``The benefits go beyond what you can see in terms of the
reduction,'' said Nora Lustig, who teaches at the Colegio de
Mexico, a graduate school and think tank, and is a visiting fellow
at the Brookings Institute in Washington, D.C.
   ``It generates the impression to the world and investors who
want to go to Mexico that the financial stability is more or less
there,'' she said.
   Economists say elements still needed for recovery are
confidence, lower interest rates, investment, domestic savings,
reduction of the government deficit and continued containment of
wages and price.
   They said that, even if those conditions are met, the government
must be careful not to let the economy overheat and generate more
inflation.
   ``The agreement will let the economy grow and will gradually
raise our standard of living. It doesn't permit dreams. But with
work, we can return to sustained growth,'' Treasury Secretary Pedro
Aspe told a luncheon gathering of 500 of Mexico's elite and
powerful.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari also spoke to the gathering
attended by Mexico's most powerful business, industry, media, labor
and farm leaders.
   In his remarks, Salinas said, ``every Mexican must now redouble
his efforts'' but that those efforts can now be made with ``spirit,
even happiness'' because they will result in progress.
   Mexico's agreement in principle with a steering committee of 15
creditor banks was seen as a test of Bush administration policy for
reducing Third World debt and as a milestone for other debtor
countries waiting to renegotiate.
   It represents the first significant reduction in a government's
debt to commercial banks.
   ``For the banks it is hard, but something they can live with,''
said M. Peter McPherson, executive vice president of Bank of
America. ``This really was a big reduction of assets for the banks,
and this was a big matter for Mexico in terms of how to get on top
of the debt problem.''
   Under the agreement, banks have three options: a 35 percent
reduction in principle, reduction of the interest rate to 6\
percent from the current average of about 10 percent, or providing
new loans equal to 25 percent of what Mexico owes the bank.
   The deal applies to about $54 billion of Mexico's foreign debt,
which totals $107 billion, second in the developing world only to
the $120 billion owed by Brazil.
   After more details are worked ut, which is expected to take a
few weeks, the agreement will be sent to the more than 500 creditor
banks for approval and choice of options.
   ``Is it enough so that Mexico is in a relatively comfortable
position to keep up with its payments? Definitely yes,'' said
Jonathan Heath of Macro-Asesoria, an economic consulting firm.
   He added, however, that savings provided by the agreement were
not necessarily enough to achieve President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's goal of 6 percent annual economic growth by the end of
his six-year term in 1994.
   ``That point is still to be seen because the external debt is
the first step and probably the most important one,'' but those
savings alone will not be enough to finance the growth, Heath said.
   Mexico had a net inflow of resources when its economy was
growing, he said, but with the agreement, the country still will be
sending out more foreign exchange than it gets.
   Officials in Washington estimated the various options could save
Mexico about $1.5 billion annually of the $5 billion-$5.5 billion
in interest on the $54 billion of commercial debt involved.
   Rogelio Ramirez de la O., a Mexican economic consultant, said
the net transfer of funds abroad would be more than 4 percent of
the gross domestic product even with the agreement. The
government's goal was to reduce the amount from 7 percent to 2
percent.
   ``I am confident the agreement is going to boost optimism in the
private sector,'' he said, but added: ``The Mexican crisis is not
over.''
   Abel Beltran-del-Rio, director of CIEMEX-WEFA, an economic
consulting firm in Philadelphia, said the biggest risk was renewed
inflation,
   ``The greatest risk is that it may generate growing pressure on
public spending, which has fallen behind, especially in
government-owned industries, and for salary increases,'' he said.
   Beltran-del-Rio said the government wage-price plan that brought
inflation down from 159.2 percent in 1987 to an anticipated 20
percent 22 percent this year still will be needed.

   Paramount Communications Inc. abandoned
its $12.2 billion hostile bid for Time Inc. on Monday after the
Delaware Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision allowing Time
to proceed with its $14 billion buyout of Warner Communications Inc.
   ``We find no error of law by the Court of Chancery,'' Justice
Henry R. Horsey announced as the three-judge panel unanimously
sustained a ruling by Judge William T. Allen, thereby affirming the
rights of corporate directors to decide the future course of their
companies.
   The decision ended Paramount's seven-week bid to acquire Time.
Paramount issued a statement that it was dropping its $200 a share
buyout offer but would continue trying to expand through
acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or partnerships.
   ``We believe in making bold moves when they are in the best
interest of Paramount Communications shareholders,'' said Paramount
Chairman Martin Davis. ``We have just demonstrated that in our
offer for Time ...''
   Paramount and several of Time's biggest shareholders
unsuccessfully had sought an injunction against Time's tender offer
for Warner, claiming that Time should be forced to consider
Paramount's buyout offer.
   The tender offer for Warner expired at 5 p.m. EDT and Time
announced it held more than 117 million Warner shares, or about 58
percent of the company's outstanding common stock. Time said it
would announce Tuesday the exact number of shares tendered under
its offer.
   Under its $70 a share offer, Time was to purchase slightly more
than half of Warner's common stock and exchange a combination of
cash and securities valued at $70 a share for the rest. Time said
shareholders would start to be paid for the tendered shares on
Monday.
   When their merger is complete _ a process expected to take
several months the new Time Warner Inc., will be the world's
largest communications concern.
   Paramount said it would not pursue a bid for Time Warner.
   Allen's ruling gave corporate directors latitude in defending
against unwanted takeover bids that they claim interfere with a
company's long-term strategy.
   The judge said the proposed Time-Warner deal, which was
announced in March, three months before Paramount launched its bid,
was the result of long-term business planning and that Paramount
and Time's shareholders could not interfere.
   Paramount has contended that once Time announced its plan to
merge with Warner it effectively placed itself up for sale and
under Delaware law therefore had to consider Paramount's offer.
   During more than two hours of arguments before the Supreme Court
Monday, Paramount attorney Melvyn Cantor said Time's board had a
fiduciary duty to inquire into Paramount's initial $175 a share
buyout offer.
   ``We don't question that Time-Warner is a good deal,'' Cantor
said, but he contended Time shareholders should have had a chance
to vote on whether Paramount's acquisition of the company would
have been a better deal in the short term.
   Michael Klein, an attorney for major Time shareholders,
including Texas investor Robert M. Bass, said thousands of the
company's stockholders opposed the Time-Warner merger. He argued
that based on previous Delaware court rulings, the board was
obligated to consider Paramount's offer.
   But Justice Andrew G.T. Moore interjected that Klein's argument
would make a board hostage ``to anyone who walked in with a bid,''
regardless of a company's long-range plans.
   Klein said after the court ruled that the decision tilted
Delaware law in favor of management. He predicted attorneys would
advise corporations to develop an ``appearance of a long-term
plan'' to ward off potential takeover bids.
   When Time attorney Robert Joffe presented his case Monday, the
justices asked why Time's tender offer for Warner _ which replaced
an earlier stock-swap merger plan _ was not submitted to a vote by
Time shareholders at the company's annual meeting in June.
   Joffe said a vote was not required because the deal did not
involve the issuing of new Time stock. Furthermore, he said, after
Paramount announced its bid on June 6, the market for Time stock
was in disarray and the price of the shares was seesawing.
   ``This was hardly the situation to have an unimpassioned
evaluation of future value and get a fair vote,'' he said.
   Joffe contended Time's plans to merge with Warner would give
shareholders greater value in the long term than Paramount's $200 a
share offer.
   The case was heard in Delaware because all three companies _
like many of the biggest U.S. corporations _ are incorporated
there. Because so many major corporations subject to Delaware laws,
the Time case likely will have implications for other companies in
the future.
   The Supreme Court planned to issue a written decision at some
point in the future.
   The justices' ruling was widely expected even before the hearing
began. As arguments proceeded _ and were televised live by Cable
News Network _ Time's stock dropped on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Time stock closed down $1 at $137.50 a share. Warner stock
rose$1.62{ to $66.12{ a share and Paramount rose $1.87{ to $59.37{
a share.
   Time stock, which traded at $126 a share before the Paramount
bid, rose to a high of $182.75 before falling back in recent weeks
as investors became increasingly pessimistic about the chances for
Paramount's success.
