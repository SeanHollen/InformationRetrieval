   A doctor committed no crime when he
brandished a pistol at a dog that went after his miniature pig in
his backyard, a judge ruled.
   District Justice William Ivill on Wednesday dismissed charges
against Dr. Anthony Barrera, 36, who was charged with recklessly
endangering another person, simple assault and disorderly conduct in
the incident.
   Barrera's neighbor, Melvin Kelly, testified he and his wife were
caring for a stray dog, a young Siberian husky weighing about 40
pounds, when the dog got away from him and went after Barrera's
miniature pig next door.
   Barrera started waving a pistol at the dog but ``did not point
the gun directly at me,'' Kelly said.
   But, Kelly said, ``I felt like I was being intimidated.''
   Testimony showed that neither animal was injured and no shots
were fired in this Pittsburgh suburb.
   Ivill said Barrera was on his own property and was licensed to
carry a gun. He ruled Barrera was a man ``preparing to defend his
pet from a trespassing animal.''
   Barrera said he obtained the gun for protection and the pig
because ``I'm asthmatic and allergic to dogs and cats.''

   Launch of the Discovery and its
five-astronaut crew could be scheduled for late next week as NASA
prepares for the third post-Challenger shuttle mission.
   NASA officials, who planned to announce a launch date today, said
Wednesday the liftoff would occur no sooner than March 11 because of
the need to replace a failed electrical part in one of the shuttle's
three main engines.
   The target date had been March 9, but the Air Force told NASA
Monday that it planned to launch a high-priority military rocket on
that day and could not support a shuttle flight with Air Force
tracking facilities.
   The electrical part problem apparently took care of that
potential conflict. But a delay in the military flight could affect
the shuttle launch on a day-by-day basis. The Air Force mission has
priority for national security reasons.
   During five days in orbit, Discovery's astronauts are to deploy a
large communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments.

   The so-called February ratings sweep indicate NBC
and CBS have rebounded from last year's writers' strike, but network
executives say the September-April ``season'' used to track the
ratings race should be yearlong.
   ``I know you guys love races,'' said David Poltrack, CBS vice
president for marketing, ``but any discussion of full-season results
is a historical curiosity and not a marketing issue, and a
disservice to us.''
   Alan Wurtzel, ABC's senior vice president for marketing and
research, said the season race is now ``a spectator sport'' and
means nothing except for bragging rights.
   ``In 1989, to say there is a `season' is so antiquated,'' said
Wurtzel. ``That means we would be abdicating the audience five
months of the year, and that's not something we can afford to do.''
   NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff has long held that
the ratings race season should be year-round, too, but such talk
didn't come up at Thursday's NBC briefing on the February sweep
rating period _ one of four months a year when local TV ratings are
measured to determine advertising rates.
   But then, NBC is winning another season hands-down.
   Ten years ago when the average viewer had few channels available,
the networks didn't have to worry about losing their audience to
competition from cable or videocassettes over the summer, but times
have changed. The audience that has access to an average of 25
channels will go elsewhere if the networks fail to offer them what
they want to watch.
   In February, the networks did.
   The CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' and the heated competition
it encouraged boosted the networks' aggregate rating after a more
than yearlong decline.
   The four-night ``Lonesome Dove'' boosted third-place CBS above
ABC in the February sweep and makes second place for the season a
tossup.
   NBC won the sweep with an average A.C. Nielsen Co. rating of
16.3. CBS had a 14.7 and ABC a 12.4. The rating is a percentage of
90.4 million U.S. homes with televisions.
   ABC had a 28 percent decline in February compared to February
1988, when it had the Winter Olympics. NBC and CBS showed increases
this February over last.
   ABC was forced, because of the writers' strike, to run the first
18-hour stretch of its 32-hour miniseries ``War and Remembrance'' in
November. Hardly a ratings blockbuster, it still did better than
ABC's regular programming. The decision to run the program then came
back to haunt the network in February when ``War and Remembrance''
was to have run.
   ``Clearly we had a disappointing sweeps,'' said Wurtzel.
   ``We did not have an enormous inventory, because we had to play
`War and Remembrance' early, and we had planned to play it in
February,'' he said. ``The other two networks knew that and planned
accordingly.''
   CBS got a big push, both in ratings and morale, from the
critically acclaimed ``Lonesome Dove,'' the highest-rated network
miniseries in more than four years. But the miniseries' success
pleased ABC and NBC, too.
   ``I think `Lonesome Dove' was beneficial to everybody,'' said
Wurtzel. ``Network television needs to have exciting, well-made
programming.''
   NBC even used figures from the week of ``Lonesome Dove'' to
contend that network ``reach'' has not declined in the past decade,
even if ratings have.
   ``Say we (the networks) are all throwing a party,'' explained
Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice president for research projects. ``The same
number of people come to the party, but instead of staying 2{ hours,
maybe they stay two hours, then they go to someone else's party.''

   Where drivers passing the
maximum-security Nevada State Prison see a grim, century-old
building of hand-hewn granite blocks and iron window bars, Disney
production people saw a set for Tom Selleck's next movie.
   They wanted a building with a forbidden look for ``Hard Rain,'' a
story set in a California prison in the early 1900s.
   Producer Robert Cort and director Peter Yates considered about 60
prisons and visited 15 sites before deciding to film outdoor scenes
at the prison, located on the outskirts of the state capital in the
high desert of northwest Nevada.
   The Nevada facility was chosen because it had two yards, and ``we
could be guaranteed that their security would not interfere with our
work and our work wouldn't interfere with their security,'' said
Ellen Pasternak, the movie's unit publicist.
   Robin Holabird, deputy director of Nevada's film office, said
while the Disney movie is the most recent planned for the prison,
her office receives a steady stream of requests for information and
visits from producers interested in filming at the historic building.
   ``When they come scouting, we tell them we're interested and will
take extra steps so they know we're serious about making a movie,''
she said. ``If all we could offer them was a new jail, it could not
have been done.''
   With ``Hard Rain,'' Nevada joins a growing number of governments
marketing prisons as movie sets to attract the millions of dollars
local economies can generate from Hollywood movie-makers looking
beyond California for new locations and lower production costs.
   ``We've got lots of competition when it comes to prisons,'' said
Bill Marsden of the Ministry of Culture film board in Alberta,
Canada, which tried unsuccessfully to attract the Disney Co. by
offering a vacant 19th century prison and prisoners from a
neighboring jail as extras for ``Hard Rain.''
   ``Now there are so many film commissions that when producers send
out circulars saying they're looking for a prison, they're sorting
through photos for weeks,'' Marsden said.
   Ohio caught the attention of filmmakers by featuring the vacant
state penitentiary in Columbus in a ``Prison for Rent'' advertising
campaign that ran in movie catalogs and magazines.
   ``It described it almost like a real estate dialogue on a piece
of property: `complete with electric chair,''' said R.J. Cavallaro,
assistant manager of the Ohio Film Bureau.
   Ohio stopped running the ``Prison for Rent'' advertisement a year
ago, Cavallaro said, partly because the campaign's success
stereotyped the state as a location for making prison movies.
   ``We do have a lot of prisons and we really are grateful that
filmmakers think of us when they think of prison movies, but we also
have to promote the rest of a very diverse state,'' he said.
   Iowa state officials recently began an aggressive campaign
promoting two state prisons by mailing out color fliers to 9,000
movie makers, according to Wendell Jarvis, director of the Iowa Film
Office.
   ``We've had a couple of feature films shot here recently and they
brought in several million dollars in a short period of time. We
want to open the doors up to bring in more of that money and work
for Iowa people,'' he said.
   Jarvis said Iowa wardens were enthusiastic about advertising
their prisons and have agreed to let crews film in working prisons.
   ``They realize they're part of our economic development effort
just like anyone else,'' he said.
   Arizona's chief warden no longer allows movie-makers in the
Arizona State Prison at Florence, once a popular location for films,
because of security and discipline concerns, according to William
McCallum, director of the Arizona Motion Picture Office. McCallum
now passes requests for the Florence prison, featured in ``Stir
Crazy'' and ``Raising Arizona,'' on to states with available prisons.
   ``We've probably lost millions of dollars because we can't get
the business,'' he said.
   In addition to money the local Nevada economy can expect to make
from ``Hard Rain'' when Disney hires local workers and buys
supplies, the Nevada State Prison itself will get economic benefits
from the movie, according to Lt. Mike Budge, a prison official and
consultant for the movie.
   ``They had to give something to the inmates, and they're donating
money to the inmate welfare fund, and with that money we're
purchasing recreational equipment,'' he said.
   Budge said the prison will get to keep a truck and 350 sets of
inmate denims Disney is supplying for the movie.
   ``They're also building a permanent guard post and adding fencing
and razor wire because they want it to look more confining, and that
only adds to our security,'' he said.
   The announcement that Disney planned to make a movie at the
prison also improved discipline among inmates, 300 of whom will be
hired as extras, Budge said.
   ``Nobody wants to get locked up and miss their chance to be in
the movie,'' he said.

   It will be four years on March 11 that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power in the Kremlin, instituting a policy of
restructuring to the Soviet system and bringing about a greater
openess of that closed society. Following is the first of a series
of reports by AP correspondents in Moscow assaying those four years.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says he was once
asked by a farmer what he was trying to accomplish with all his
reforms.
   ``Simply, we want, in spite of everything ... for working people
to lead a better life,'' Gorbachev said he replied. ``I thought it
was enough to say.''
   Perhaps it's as simple as that: the quaint wish of a Russian
peasant's son who grew up in such hardship that at one point he was
kept out of school for want of shoes.
   But he was taught to dream in the time of Nikita S. Khrushchev,
another reformist Soviet leader of humble origins, and indications
are Gorbachev dreams of grander, more profound changes not just for
the people but for the state.
   Seventy years after the Russian Revolution, the Soviet economy is
in serious trouble and communism has not provided a better life for
workers who yearn for bigger apartments, better working conditions,
more nourishing and varied food. And an economy ruled from the
center has not kept pace with the technology of the West.
   In what would by American measure be a full presidential term,
Gorbachev has made wholesale changes in the way the world perceives
him and the nation he leads. He has thrown open prisons and labor
camps and, in some cases, borders to free thousands of political
prisoners and permit tens of thousands of people to leave the
country.
   He has eased, although certainly not eliminated, the fear of
foreigners. Under ``glasnost'' he has converted the mass media from
a tightly controlled propaganda organ to a braying calliope of
complaints, debates, exposes and experiments testing just how far
the new openness may go _ and to what purpose.
   Yet for all his effort, the changes at home have been largely
atmospheric. His plans for ``perestroika,'' or restructuring Soviet
society, have faltered.
   The forces that keep this vast nation a drab, monolithic parody
of the communist state envisioned by its founders resist each
tangible step toward that ``better life'' Gorbachev seeks for those
he calls ``the simple people who are the salt of our countries.''
   Store shelves are barren. Meat, butter, cheese and sugar are
widely rationed. Such simple necessities as winter boots and
windshield wipers are perpetually unavailable, and consumers may
wait for years to buy long-outdated models of ``modern
conveniences'' such as washing machines, cars or even electric irons.
   The air in urban areas is filthy, the water unreliable, living
quarters poorly planned and filled far beyond capacity. Crash
construction programs produce instant ruins: crumbling high rises
barely habitable by the time they are occupied years after their
first cracked concrete slabs were laid to start them on their way.
   One of the imponderables of this tumultuous time is how long even
a remarkably dynamic and politically astute leader has to accomplish
the goals he has set for himself, fighting the shortcomings of the
system and inertia-bound bureaucrats.
   One simple measure of how long the road is and how much time
progress takes: Last summer, the Communist Party Central Committee
set as a national goal the installation of a telephone in just
one-half of all Soviet homes by 1995. People in urban areas wait
years for a phone, and many rural districts don't have any service.
Villagers five miles from Moscow draw their water from community
wells.
   It is a fundamental tenet of official American analysis that the
``better life'' Gorbachev seeks for his countrymen is not an end in
itself but the means of maintaining his nation's superpower status
in a fast-changing world. The Soviet Union, according to that view,
can no longer afford its own military might and can't use its power
to keep pace with _ or even steal _ the technology that is quickly
increasing the gulf between the industrialized West and the
long-stagnant East.
   As Gorbachev has pressed for more discussion of problems,
modernization of services, development of private initiative and
greater public participation in the political process, Westerners
have been tempted to think he is trying to fashion a nation
resembling the world's other great superpower, the United States.
   A pragmatic leader who calls himself a realist, Gorbachev
repeatedly insists he intends to work within the framework of
socialism. Both he and Alexander Yakovlev, said to be his closest
adviser, have written books critical of the United States and what
they said was its intolerance for other ways of life and thought.
   Regardless of any personal vision, Gorbachev is pushed by
economic reality to reorder Soviet priorities.
   ``He doesn't have the resources to sustain the investments the
Soviet Union is making in foreign policy and defense,'' said one
Western analyst who discussed the issue on condition he not be
identified.
   NATO estimates the Soviet Union devotes 15 percent to 25 percent
of its gross national product to the military.
   ``Even the lower end of that range would be enormous by world
standards,'' the analyst said. ``The upper end is truly staggering.
But that's not all, because that same 15 to 25 percent monopolizes
the country's scientific and technological resources and people.''
   To begin reducing those figures, Gorbachev already has negotiated
the first treaty reducing U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals and has
announced substantial unilateral reductions in Soviet grounds forces
at home and abroad, including this month's completion of the
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   ``Part of the reordering of priorities is to work on what
Gorbachev calls the `enemy image,''' the analyst said. ``He has to
persuade other leaders he's serious and lower the perception of risk
in the rest of the world.''

   Even in good times it's hard for Southerners
to trash anything that comes from a hog, hence the presidential
snack, pork rinds.
   ``You don't throw nothing away,'' said Larry Pierce, manager of
the Nahunta Pork Center. ``You use everything from a hog but the
squeal.''
   ``It's the finest food substance available on the planet,'' said
state Sen. Wendell Murphy, a Duplin County hog farmer and one of the
largest pork producers in the nation.
   Hogs provide hams, pork chops, bacon and sausage. Their feet are
pickled, the intestines are used as casings for sausage, the tails
are used for seasoning and the hide ends up in fancy driving gloves,
Hush Puppy shoes and President George Bush's favorite munchie.
   Pierce, who produces pork rinds, thinks it's great that Bush
prefers them with Tabasco sauce. But if the president wants some of
Nahunta's home-style skins, he'll have to come to this crossroads 50
miles southeast of Raleigh to get them.
   ``It will probably be good for the pork industry, but there's not
much way for it to help our business,'' said Pierce, whose father
founded the company 24 years ago. ``We process 100 skins a week and
can't meet the demand from our customers as it is.''
   The pork company, which makes up most of Nahunta, started as a
slaughterhouse in 1955 and added retail pork sales in 1975. It does
not distribute its products, but more than 3,000 people a week come
by to pick out fresh pork and cured hams. They also grab up 99-cent
bags of Pierce's salted and deep-fried pork skins.
   ``We process about 500 hogs a week,'' Pierce said, ``but we're
real particular about the skins we use. If they aren't quite up to
snuff, we won't use them. That's why we only turn about 100 skins a
week into pork rinds.''
   A special machine slices the skin off of pork pieces. The skin
pieces are cooked for four hours in vats to dry out the fat. Then
the hard, shriveled skins are deep fried.
   The pieces of skin swell and pop, turning into puffy slabs of
rind in minutes.
   ``This is our scientific measuring process,'' Pierce said as he
dipped a handful of salt from a bucket and spread it over the fried
rinds.
   ``Ones that come out like this, we throw away,'' he said,
plucking a dark, hard chunk from among the beige sheets of fried
skin. ``And we've got two grades of rinds.
   ``The ones that come out really nice and thin are No. Ones,'' he
said. ``Your thicker skins that come out a little tougher are No.
Twos.''
   A bag of No. Ones, which weighs a little more than 3 ounces, and
a 12-ounce bag of No. Twos go for the same price _ 99 cents.
   ``We actually sell more of the No. Twos,'' Pierce said. ``People
seem to like to gnaw on them a little bit.''
   A half-ounce serving of pork rinds provides little in the way of
nutrition; potato chips and peanuts have more nutrients, but also
more fat and cholesterol.
   A U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis showed a two-ounce
package of rinds contains 315 calories; 32.5 grams of protein; 18.9
grams of fat; 58 milligrams of cholesterol; and 1,054 milligrams of
salt.
   The Snack Food Association said pork rind sales nationally
totaled $195 million in 1987, a figure dwarfed by potato chips,
which had $3.8 billion in sales the same year.
   Dwayne Pilkington, a professor of food science at North Carolina
State University, said the origin of pork rinds is lost in history.
   ``I don't know when people started popping skins or why,''
Pilkington said. ``I don't know if it's a takeoff from the old days
of crackling or what.''
   Crackling, or cracklin', is hog fat that has the lard squeezed
out of it and is then cooked. In some areas, the layer of fat was
ground up with the skin to make the crisp treat.
   ``It could be that somebody had a piece of skin left over from
cracklin', put it on a stove and it popped, sort of an accidental
discovery,'' Pilkington said.
   Pierce said he isn't sure why pork rinds have remained a regional
delicacy, limited mainly to the South.
   Murphy, who raises a million hogs a year, said other areas of the
country have just lagged behind the South in realizing how good pork
rinds are.
   ``Anybody that doesn't like them has just never tasted them,''
Murphy said. Murphy, a Democrat, said he was aware of the Republican
president's use of symbolism in the 1988 campaign, but he did not
believe Bush used pork rinds as a populist snack to fight a
less-than-macho image.
   ``I really think he ate them before the presidential campaign,''
Murphy said. ``But maybe nobody paid much attention to what he ate
when he wasn't the president. The office sure changes that.''

   A 60-day, 1,200-mile ski and dog sled
trek from Siberia to Alaska will be more celebration than
exploration for a dozen U.S. and Soviet adventurers setting out this
weekend.
   Aside from cold-weather research, the primary object of the
Bering Bridge Expedition across seldom-visited sections of the
Soviet Far East and arctic Alaska is good will, said Paul Schurke,
33, of Ely, Minn., who describes the trip as adventure diplomacy.
   ``My pocket is full of cross-flagged (U.S.-Soviet) pins,''
Schurke said. ``We'll be leaving a full-sized American flag in each
Soviet village; a Soviet flag in each Alaska village.''
   The expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common
cultural heritage of the indigenous population of the Bering region,
Schurke said.
   Some of the team members have relatives on opposite sides of the
border, and it is hoped the trek will result in a relaxation of
rules barring visits by natives _ some of whom live within 2{ miles
of one another on islands in the Bering Strait, separated only by
sea ice and Cold War politics.
   The six-member U.S. team arrived in this Siberian city of 16,000
Wednesday, after two weather delays.
   They joined their six Soviet counterparts for a news conference,
a VIP dinner and the beginning of several days of medical
experiments. It was the first visit in decades by Americans to this
treeless city built of locally produced concrete blocks set atop
permafrost.
   Three Soviets and three Americans on the journey are natives, and
speak several local dialects including Yupik, a language common to
Eskimos in both countries.
   The trek across ancient trade and migration routes up the
Siberian side of the Bering Strait and down the Alaskan side is to
stop in 16 villages in the Chukotka district of Siberia and 14 in
Alaska, organizers said. It will end about April 1 in Kotzebue,
Alaska, just above the Arctic Circle and about 550 miles northwest
of Anchorage.
   ``Youth groups have arranged for festivities which will include
receptions and sharing of native dances and, hopefully, some native
foods,'' Schurke said.
   ``We expect we will come up with some sort of goodwill ceremony
that we'll stick with for each of our visits, and then let it roll
spontaneously.''
   Negotiations began a week ago between the U.S. State Department
and the Soviets on re-opening the border closed by the Soviets
during the Berlin blockade in 1948. Schurke said he hoped a treaty
might be ready for signing as early as April 1 on the Bering Sea ice.
   ``What marks this trip is the sheer volume of human contact,''
said Schurke, veteran of an unsupplied sled dog expedition to the
North Pole in 1986. ``The populations of the villages we will be
visiting totals close to 50,000.''
   Most of the journey will be on relatively smooth coastal ice,
with detours around pressure ridges and open water. There was
concern about huge stretches of open water reported near the U.S.
island of Little Diomede and the Soviet island of Big Diomede which
flank the International Dateline and the border dividing the two
countries.
   ``There is big water in the Bering Straits,'' said Dimitri
Shparo, the Soviet co-leader of the expedition who was speaking
through an interpreter. ``That could force us to detour several
hundred miles north to find ice.
   ``The farther we go into March, the more the sun will work on the
ice,'' the 47-year-old polar explorer said. ``The (ocean) current
moving through those two islands also is fierce.''
   The expedition is only the latest attempt to warm the climate in
superpower relations at the point where the nations are closest.
   U.S. and Soviet officials and Eskimos flew from Nome to the
Siberian port of Provideniya for a one-day visit last spring, and a
group of Soviets spent the last week of February in Alaska for talks
with government and industry leaders.

   The Pilgrims were happy with venison and beef
jerky. Yuppies turned to blackened redfish and quiche. But are you
ready for the meal of choice in the 21st century? Try gas flushed
chicken.
   That entree was among an array of culinary choices outlined
Thursday that food experts believe may comprise our menus in the
future.
   More encouraging, however, is the ease with which we may buy such
items. Video shopping, according to experts, is one possibility.
Robot checkout cashiers is another.
   ``Fast food is too damn slow,'' said Marty Friedman, editor of
New Product News. ``No one has time for fast food anymore.''
   But if the food writers and product spokesmen at the 11th annual
International Association of Cooking Professionals are correct, we
don't have much to look forward to.
   They foresee a world where ``cooking becomes something few
understand while heating becomes something everyone does.''
   Fast food home delivery, triple packaged, resealable potato
chips, oat bran popcorn, and ``melting pot ethnic foods'' like the
``burritski'' _ a burrito filled with Polish sausage _ are almost
upon us.
   The real villain, they said, can be summed up in one word:
microwave.
   Because today's busy career people want food on demand, the
microwave is threatening to reshape the way we cook and eat,
according to Richard Nelson, director of marketing research for the
Campbell Soup Co.
   ``They'll probably be one microwave per person in the future,''
said Nelson, who used a slide show to accompany his address at the
convention. ``That way, no one will have to wait to eat.''
   Nelson flashed a slide he said symbolized the microwave's impact
on society. The picture showed a haughty waiter at a fancy
restaurant asking a well-dressed patron, ``How would you like your
steak done, sir?''
   The customer responded: ``Three minutes on high, turned every 30
seconds.''
   But countering the trend toward heavily packaged, microwave food
has been the public's demand for fresh food without preservatives.
   ``The freshly prepared game was started by small entrepreneurs in
major urban markets,'' said Nelson. ``Now the big boys want to
play.''
   The challenge facing food manufacturers in the future will be how
to create fresh foods with a shelf life while keeping up with
continual demands for products to use in the microwave, the
panelists said.
   One example is gas flushed chicken, the term for a high-tech
packaging process in which the bird is precooked without
preservatives in a vacuum-sealed bag; the end result doesn't require
refrigeration.
   ``Convenience, health, indulgence _ those will be the major
issues in the future,'' said Richard Gerstman, a food consultant
with Gerstman and Myers.
   The current tendency toward ``cocooning,'' the panelists said,
will play a major role in how food is purchased in the future.
   ``People are just going to want to put on their slippers and turn
on the VCR. They won't want to go out,'' said Friedman.
   Stores in Chicago are already testing a cable home food shopping
program and a chain in Atlanta is testing automated checkers, the
panelists said.
   But for those who like an occasional foray to the supermarket,
they may also find the shopping cart of the future has changed.
``Video carts'' will come with a flashing screen promoting various
products.
   Among harried husbands and wives of the future, the experts
predicted, the greeting upon returning home will be ``whose turn is
it to heat?''

   NEW SUNDAY TABLOID IN NAKED CITY!
   This weekend, the New York Post joins the crowd at the city's
Sunday newsstands, its Fleet Street tilt a fading memory as it
challenges the Daily News and New York Newsday for tabloid supremacy
on the week's highest-stakes advertising day.
   The Post is confident about its debut Sunday; its competitors are
ready and waiting.
   ``When you see this paper on Saturday night, it's going to look
like a Sunday paper that's been around for 30, 40 years,'' promised
Peter Kalikow, the real estate magnate who saved the Post from
extinction one year ago with a $37 million takeover.
   ``The sections are right, the comics are right, the magazine is
right. It's really there.''
   To let the public know its plans, the Post put commercials on
television and a clever full-page advertisement Friday in one of its
competitors, The New York Times.
   The Times ad, in the form of two tabloid-size pages on the back
of Times' front section, could be folded to simulate the Post's
front and back pages.
   A banner news headline in the ad said it was ``Announcing A Cure
For The Common Sunday.'' Another headline over what would be the
sports page reads, ``Post Goes To Game 7!''
   Industry analysts question if the financing and the market are
right. They predict the Post's move to Sunday _ where a successful
newspaper makes 40 percent to 50 percent of its advertising money _
could mean the demise of at least one of the tabloids.
   ``The question is whether this market is capable of supporting
three daily tabloids. Ask God and the readers,'' said Daily News
Editor F. Gilman Spencer. ``This one is in stable shape, without any
question. ... We're in good shape to take on all comers.''
   Kalikow, on the eve of running out 575,000 copies of the Sunday
Post, believes three tabloids can live happily ever after in New
York. Ad space for the first three weeks in the 128-page paper is
sold out, including space in the pull-out book and travel sections,
Kalikow said.
   He also cites changes recently made in the competition's Sunday
editions as evidence his paper is already a factor: the News'
expanded sports page, Newsday's additional color pages. Spencer and
Newsday Associate Publisher Steven Isenberg said those moves were in
works before the Post went weekend.
   None of this is expected to affect The New York Times or its
massive Sunday edition. The Times can ``stand back and wait, and
then see who's left,'' said industry analyst John Morton.
   But while Kalikow is confident, others in the industry remain
skeptical. The last time the Post had a Sunday edition was during a
newspaper strike in 1978. It was scrapped when the strike ended.
   ``So far, there does not appear to be room for three profitable
daily tabloids; that's certainly the same for Sunday,'' said
newspaper analyst Bruce Thorp of the Provident National Bank. ``I'm
not convinced there's room for two profitable daily tabloids.''
   Agreed Morton, ``The problem is you've got a town that probably
can't support that many newspapers. New York is probably the last
remaining city with the market segmentation to support two
newspapers.
   ``But three or four, in the long run, is probably not do-able.''
   The Post runs third in the city circulation race, trailing the
Daily News (1,281,706) and The New York Times (1,038,829) and
leading New York Newsday (176,043), according to the Audit Bureau of
Circulations figures from Sept 30, 1988. Kalikow anticipates a
similar Sunday showing.
   Morton and Thorp cited other problems the Post faces: lack of
home delivery (Kalikow says a major push to change that is under
way.); overcoming Sunday readership loyalty (Kalikow believes the
paper's 550,473 weekday readers will buy the Post.); tremendous
start-up costs (Kalikow, without mentioning figures, says the Sunday
paper is here to stay.).
   Here for the paper's first 12 weeks is a reader inducement _ a $1
million stock market game which also will run in weekdays.
   More likely to draw readers are the changes wrought at the Post
under editor Jane Amsterdam in the year since Kalikow's purchase of
the paper, which was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton.
   Gone are many of the Rupert Murdoch flourishes which marked his
reign at the Post: no more ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR''
headlines, no unchallenged liberal-bashing, no jam-packed pages
desperate for space.
   ``Things have improved on a financial basis, the morale has
improved, the quality of the paper has improved,'' Kalikow said.
``Things have really improved far beyond what we had ever expected.''

<HEAD>New Survey Shows Most Americans _ Even The Old _ Ignore Flu Shots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans age 65 and over should get
flu shots every year but most don't bother, in part because of
unfounded fears of the vaccine, federal health experts say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that only
12 percent of Americans in a recent survey said they had received an
influenza vaccination in the preceding year. That included only 32
percent of those 65 and over, a group at increased risk for death or
severe complications from the flu.
   An official 1990 U.S. health objective calling for at least 60
percent of older Americans to receive annual flu shots ``is not
likely to be met,'' the CDC conceded in its report.
   ``Unfortunately, there are a lot of fears of side effects from
the vaccine, and a lot of misconceptions that the vaccine can cause
influenza _ neither of which is true,'' said Dr. Mary Ann Sprauer, a
CDC immunization specialist.
   Current flu vaccines do not cause influenza themselves, and they
cause a day or two of fever and aches in fewer than 10 percent of
those who take the shot, she said.
   The CDC's survey on health risks and behavior patterns was
conducted in 1987 in 31 participating states and Washington, D.C.
Only 7 percent of those 18-44, 11 percent of those 45-64 and 32
percent of those 65 and up said they had received flu vaccine in the
previous 12 months.
   The CDC especially recommends flu vaccine for people at increased
risk of severe complications from influenza, including older people
and those already suffering from certain chronic medical problems
such as heart disease.
   Other surveys have shown that ``only about 20 percent of
high-risk individuals get the shot in a typical year,'' said Dr.
Walter Gunn, a CDC flu specialist. In addition to fears about the
vaccine, he said, many people ``just don't know that flu typically
kills 20,000 Americans in the average year.''
   Adding to the problem, Ms. Sprauer said, is the fact that
``often, health care providers don't recommend the vaccine. A lot of
(patients) would be willing to get it if it were offered to them.''
   Among the states participating in the health-risk survey, New
York had the worst rate of flu vaccination, only 9 percent. Hawaii
was highest at 19 percent.
   Among older people in particular, percentages ranged from 24
percent in Rhode Island to 41 percent in Montana.
   Flu vaccine is believed to be about 90 percent effective in
preventing illness in healthy younger people and about 75 percent
effective in preventing serious illness or death in high-risk
elderly populations, the CDC reported.
   The Atlanta-based CDC also reported Thursday that the 1988-89 flu
season is continuing at serious levels.
   A key indicator of severe flu activity _ the CDC's tracking of
deaths from either pneumonia or flu in selected cities _ was at
higher-than-expected levels last week for the fifth week in a row,
Gunn said.
   That indicator now has reached its highest point this winter,
``as bad as anything we've had in the past several years,'' he said.
   Gunn said the predominant flu strains circulating in the United
States are those known as the Victoria flu, the Taiwan flu and the
Sichuan flu, all of which are protected against by the recommended
1988-89 flu vaccine.

   Even in good times it's hard for Southerners
to trash anything that comes from a hog, hence the presidential
snack, pork rinds.
   ``You don't throw nothing away,'' said Larry Pierce, manager of
the Nahunta Pork Center. ``You use everything from a hog but the
squeal.''
   ``It's the finest food substance available on the planet,'' said
state Sen. Wendell Murphy, a Duplin County hog farmer and one of the
largest pork producers in the nation.
   Hogs provide hams, pork chops, bacon and sausage. Their feet are
pickled, the intestines are used as casings for sausage, the tails
are used for seasoning and the hide ends up in fancy driving gloves,
Hush Puppy shoes and President George Bush's favorite munchie.
   Pierce, who produces pork rinds, thinks it's great that Bush
prefers them with Tabasco sauce. But if the president wants some of
Nahunta's home-style skins, he'll have to come to this crossroads 50
miles southeast of Raleigh to get them.
   ``It will probably be good for the pork industry, but there's not
much way for it to help our business,'' said Pierce, whose father
founded the company 24 years ago. ``We process 100 skins a week and
can't meet the demand from our customers as it is.''
   The pork company, which makes up most of Nahunta, started as a
slaughterhouse in 1955 and added retail pork sales in 1975. It does
not distribute its products, but more than 3,000 people a week come
by to pick out fresh pork and cured hams. They also grab up 99-cent
bags of Pierce's salted and deep-fried pork skins.
   ``We process about 500 hogs a week,'' Pierce said, ``but we're
real particular about the skins we use. If they aren't quite up to
snuff, we won't use them. That's why we only turn about 100 skins a
week into pork rinds.''
   A special machine slices the skin off of pork pieces. The skin
pieces are cooked for four hours in vats to dry out the fat. Then
the hard, shriveled skins are deep fried.
   The pieces of skin swell and pop, turning into puffy slabs of
rind in minutes.
   ``This is our scientific measuring process,'' Pierce said as he
dipped a handful of salt from a bucket and spread it over the fried
rinds.
   ``Ones that come out like this, we throw away,'' he said,
plucking a dark, hard chunk from among the beige sheets of fried
skin. ``And we've got two grades of rinds.
   ``The ones that come out really nice and thin are No. Ones,'' he
said. ``Your thicker skins that come out a little tougher are No.
Twos.''
   A bag of No. Ones, which weighs a little more than 3 ounces, and
a 12-ounce bag of No. Twos go for the same price _ 99 cents.
   ``We actually sell more of the No. Twos,'' Pierce said. ``People
seem to like to gnaw on them a little bit.''
   A half-ounce serving of pork rinds provides little in the way of
nutrition; potato chips and peanuts have more nutrients, but also
more fat and cholesterol.
   A U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis showed a two-ounce
package of rinds contains 315 calories; 32.5 grams of protein; 18.9
grams of fat; 58 milligrams of cholesterol; and 1,054 milligrams of
salt.
   The Snack Food Association said pork rind sales nationally
totaled $195 million in 1987, a figure dwarfed by potato chips,
which had $3.8 billion in sales the same year.
   Dwayne Pilkington, a professor of food science at North Carolina
State University, said the origin of pork rinds is lost in history.
   ``I don't know when people started popping skins or why,''
Pilkington said. ``I don't know if it's a takeoff from the old days
of crackling or what.''
   Crackling, or cracklin', is hog fat that has the lard squeezed
out of it and is then cooked. In some areas, the layer of fat was
ground up with the skin to make the crisp treat.
   ``It could be that somebody had a piece of skin left over from
cracklin', put it on a stove and it popped, sort of an accidental
discovery,'' Pilkington said.
   Pierce said he isn't sure why pork rinds have remained a regional
delicacy, limited mainly to the South.
   Murphy, who raises a million hogs a year, said other areas of the
country have just lagged behind the South in realizing how good pork
rinds are.
   ``Anybody that doesn't like them has just never tasted them,''
Murphy said. Murphy, a Democrat, said he was aware of the Republican
president's use of symbolism in the 1988 campaign, but he did not
believe Bush used pork rinds as a populist snack to fight a
less-than-macho image.
   ``I really think he ate them before the presidential campaign,''
Murphy said. ``But maybe nobody paid much attention to what he ate
when he wasn't the president. The office sure changes that.''

<HEAD>Beirut Vintner Dodges Bombs To Make Great Wine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winemaker Serge Hochar, like some of his
competitors, likes to sell no wine before its time. But in war-torn
Beirut, it's not always up to him to decide.
   ``You never know if you'll be hit,'' Hochar said Wednesday,
adding that he's missed some vintages when fighting broke out near
his Chateau Musar, the best-known of Lebanon's five wineries.
   ``I must say, I have been very lucky,'' said the vintner, whose
products are internationally rated among the top wines of the Middle
East. ``My home, 200 yards from the fire line between east and west
Beirut, has been bombed only three times in the last 14 years, and I
managed to escape.''
   The Beirut-born winemaker, who is in his 50s, styles his wine for
cosmopolitan tastes. He was in San Francisco on Wednesday on a
seven-city U.S. tour to market his wines, which ranged from 1959 to
1980.
   Despite his unpredictable environment, Hochar says he will not
release a vintage if he doesn't like it, and he insists on holding
his wines in cellars for at least eight years.
   ``I am not a political man. I am a wine man, and a wine man is a
human person because I work with life. I keep my vines and my wines
alive,'' he said.
   Hochar makes 15,000 to 20,000 cases of wine a year at the
30-year-old winery founded by his father, Gaston. The star is his
Bordeaux red, a blend of cabernet sauvignon, cinsault and syrah.
   It can take weeks for Hochar to get grapes from the Bekaa Valley,
40 miles south of Beirut, to his winery in Lebanon's embattled
capital city.
   ``We have to cross five or six checkpoints, many borders ...
sometimes we have to go south from the vineyard and sail back by
boat.''
   And everywhere, he said, he must pay duty, at each border and to
whomever has the power _ or a gun.
   ``You get used to it after a while,'' he said. ``You don't
realize you are in a war situation. You live with it. ... In
Lebanon, you can always manage to find a few friends to make things
easier.''

<TEXT>
   Tenor Neil Shicoff triumphed in the title role of
``Werther'' on Thursday night as the Metropolitan Opera performed
the Massenet opera for the first time this season.
   In the first scene, when Werther is marveling at a garden, the
emotionalism of the Goethe hero was in his voice. Later, Shicoff's
voice shimmered, without any of the Italian sound which would be
wrong for this French opera.
   After an exceptionally long second intermission, an announcement
was made that Shicoff had been suffering from flu for a week but
would continue. This was a surprise, since neither vocal difficulty
nor the added resonance that a cold sometimes gives were heard.
   Shicoff's final act was as splendid as the two before. He even
managed to create sympathy for Werther, longing for Charlotte, who
is married. We haven't great patience for Werther's romanticism
these days.
   Mezzo-soprano Kathleen Kuhlmann, who was born in San Francisco,
was making her Met debut as Charlotte. She get fulls marks for vocal
production and preparation of the role but her voice isn't
attractive. It isn't shrill or harsh; it just isn't appealing in
tone. She sang Charlotte in a new production in Cologne and will
sing the part in a new production in Hamburg.
   Dawn Upshaw, as Charlotte's sister, Sophie, has a clear but
creamy soprano. Instead of getting by on being pert as some Sophies
do, the Nashville-born soprano sang it beautifully. Bernd Weikl of
Vienna sang Albert, Charlotte's husband, for the first time at the
Met, with a warmly inflected voice.
   The four are all attractive on stage.
   Jean Fournet from Rouen, France, conducted. He made his Met debut
in 1987 with another French opera, ``Samson and Dalila.''

   An Ohio River barge carrying a 1,000-ton
nuclear reactor from the nation's first decommissioned commercial
nuclear power plant passed this city Thursday on its two-month,
8,100-mile trip to burial at Hanford, Wash.
   ``There's a bit of history here,'' said Mike McKerman, a
consultant to the U.S. Department of Energy on the project. ``I like
to think of it as the end of the beginning of nuclear power.''
   McKernan said the nuclear plant at Shippingport, Pa., was the
first commercial nuclear plant to be commissioned in the United
States and the first to be decommissioned. It is the first in the
world to be dismantled.
   Duquesne Light Co. of Pittsburgh began operating the plant in
1957 and closed it down in 1982. Duquesne operates two other nuclear
power plants at Shippingport, about 35 miles southwest of Pittsburgh
along the Ohio River.
   Earlier this month, the reactor was mounted on the barge Paul
Bunyan. The barge, pushed by the motor vessel Pere Marquette, left
Shippingport on Tuesday for New Orleans, DOE spokesman Tom Bauman
said.
   ``The DOE has spent a lot of money on this thing to make sure it
is safe,'' said Al Zupon of the Army Corps of Engineers in
Pittsburgh. ``You could sit on top of this thing and ride it down
the river with no threat of radiation.''
   ``We are being updated on the tow's progress twice a day,''
McKerman said. ``So far, there have been no problems. It is moving
along just as it was planned.''
   The reactor, which is 35 feet long and 25 feet high and encased
in concrete, is being shipped to an Energy Department disposal site
for burial, Bauman said.
   The vessel will take the Ohio River to the Mississippi River, to
the Gulf of Mexico, to the Panama Canal, and the Pacific Ocean north
to Washington state. The journey is expected to take about 60 days,
officials said.
   The reactor parts were packed in concrete before being loaded
onto the Paul Bunyan last month, but the trip was delayed because of
bad weather, Bauman said.

   William Randolph Hearst couldn't have put it
clearer. ``Why,'' asked editor Charles Peters, summing up the
philosophy that has guided his magazine for 20 years, ``should I
publish something I don't agree with?''
   Nonetheless, to celebrate a survival that was never a sure thing,
the March issue of Peters' skinny magazine, the Washington Monthly,
violates his own premise.
   ``What's Wrong With This Magazine?'' asks the cover. Inside, 11
former editors are allowed to take issue with the boss, one of
Washington's enduring curmudgeons.
   The result: the reader gets to watch liberalism argue with itself.
   None of March's contributors quarrels with the Monthly's
fundamental liberal philosophy _ one it is no more likely to abandon
than Popular Mechanics would question the utility of the basement
workbench.
   But, like Popular Mechanics, Peters' magazine has been concerned
with the way things actually work and why they don't if they don't.
His view is that they often don't; his goal is ``to expose and
correct the follies of liberalism.'' He calls it neoliberalism.
   ``We were not trying to move the Democratic Party to the right,''
recalls former Monthly writer Nicholas Lemann. ``We were trying to
make liberalism even better and stronger than it already was.''
   Like scores of other onetime Monthly writers, Lemann moved on to
better pay, in his case at the Atlantic. Peters paid his editors
$10,000 a year _ himself $24,000 _ but gave them the chance to write
and be read in Washington.
   The magazine has 33,000 subscribers and, after a long struggle,
is in the black. Peters, a former West Virginia legislator and Peace
Corps executive, founded it with some help from investors including
Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., a fellow former Peace Corpsman.
   Arthur Levine, now with U.S. News &amp; World Report, takes the
Monthly to task for not coming to grips with the full consequences
of its advocacy of a less greedy way of life.
   ``If we're to be less materialistic ... it means that we'll buy
fewer products and there will be less revenue for business. The hard
question that neoliberals and others haven't asked is: Can we have
more time for families and volunteerism, less materialism, and still
have high economic growth? I don't think so.''
   Gregg Easterbrook, now a contributing editor of Newsweek, accuses
the Monthly of harboring an unwholesome suspicion of profits.
   ``Occasionally companies make big profits via fraud, monopoly or
other chicanery,'' he writes. ``Usually they make big profits
because they deserve to _ the market is pretty effective in
distributing that reward.''
   Anyway, asks Easterbrook, what's so bad about the
``service-yuppie-paper economy'' that America is becoming?
   ``The Monthly often laments that the backbreaking, dangerous,
soul-draining jobs in heavy industrial production are being replaced
by highly paid white-collar desk jobs. Sounds pretty good to me.''
   Michael Kinsley, now editor of The New Republic, attacks Peters'
perennial crusade for a peacetime draft.
   ``Telling people they must give up two years of their lives is a
major infringement on freedom,'' Kinsley argues. Moreover, if rich
people were drafted into the Army they would push out poor people
who are there because they want to be, he says. ``It's no favor to
would-be volunteers to shut off this option in order to put others
unwillingly in their place.''
   Peters gives himself the last word, accepting many of the
criticisms but taking issue with others.
   To Easterbrook, he says that what's wrong with maximizing profits
``is that it encourages corporations to take chances with worker
safety, to pollute the air, to attempt to gain monopoly control of
markets.''
   To Levine's growth arguments, he says, ``Without economic growth,
we won't have the tax revenues necessary to clear up the
environmental mess that already exists.''
   And to Kinsley he says a draft would give America at least one
social institution where rich and poor could come to know and
understand one another.
   ``Upper-class participation in the military would give people
with clout a compelling interest in avoiding war and, in case war
turns out to be unavoidable, in being equipped with weapons that
work,'' Peters writes. ``Thus a draft of the wealthy would both aid
military reformers and enhance the prospect for peace.''

   The jury in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
had the day off today so the former White House aide's lawyers could
detail complaints that the government is censoring material to
hamstring the defense.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is hearing arguments from
North's attorneys that the Classified Information Procedures Act
governing the handling of classified material in criminal trials
should not be applied in this case.
   North is accused of lying to Congress and the attorney general
about the Reagan administration's secret attempts to aid the
Nicaraguan Contras during a period in which U.S. aid to the rebels
was banned. The government has made repeated attempts to censor
evidence in the case.
   The defense said in a court filing that the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh ``has knowingly obstructed the conduct of
this trial'' as well as the cross-examination of a witness ``by
imposing entirely unnecessary secrecy demands on information already
in the public domain.''
   Prosecutor John Keker responded: ``Far from manipulating the
process to its advantage, the government is trying to declassify the
information that is necessary to permit this trial to reach a
conclusion.''
   The latest fight erupted when North's lawyers discovered that
memos the government was trying to censor in court had been made
public eight months earlier in a separate legal case.
   Defense lawyers said they found out Monday night that classified
memos written by North's courier to the Contras, Robert Owen, had
been turned over earlier to the Christic Institute, which opposes
U.S. policy in Central America.
   Confronted with that information, the government said it would no
longer consider the memos to be classified. Gesell, however, said he
would review his rulings on secrecy in light of the problem.
   North's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on
grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, but Gesell said he wasn't
looking for ``sanctions'' against anyone. He said his primary goal
is to see that the trial is conducted properly.
   On Thursday, two people involved in the Contra supply network
testified that North appeared to be the man in charge.
   Rafael Quintero, a Cuban who had done work for the CIA, said
North sought to reassure a high Salvadoran air force official that
President Reagan supported the Contra resupply effort.
   Quintero said that at a 1986 meeting in El Salvador, the official
expressed concern about joining with North and others in assisting
the Contras and then possibly being ``left out in the cold'' after a
few weeks or months.
   North, Quintero said, responded that ``Mr. Reagan was totally
behind this program and behind helping the Contras and all we needed
was more time for Congress to approve ... aid.''
   In another instance, retired Air Force Lt. Col. Richard Gadd, who
helped arrange for airplanes to carry supplies to the Contras,
described a meeting with North in December 1985 at a Washington
hotel. Gadd said North turned to another Air Force retiree involved
in the resupply operation, Richard Secord, and directed him to
``advance Mr. Gadd $150,000'' for parachutes and other items the
Contras wanted. Gadd subsequently got $100,000.
   Gadd arranged to provide airplanes for the covert Contra supply
operation at a time when U.S. military aid to the Contras was banned
by Congress.
   North is accused of 12 crimes, including five counts that he made
false statements and obstructed Congress in 1985 and 1986 by denying
any involvement in the Contra resupply operation.

   As glasnost and perestroika unfold in Mikhail
Gorbachev's Soviet Union, British spy novelists are looking beyond
the Evil Empire rhetoric to a more complicated approach that blurs
enemy lines.
   ``What we've lost is the natural assumption that if you say
Russians, you're talking about a certain character,'' says Gavin
Lyall, creator of the popular cloak-and-dagger character Harry Maxim.
   ``You can't be as simplistic anymore; you move in a direction of
possibly more subtlety,'' said Lyall, 57.
   Anthony Sampson remarked in The Independent newspaper recently
that ``those beloved villains (the Soviets) are losing their
villainy.''
   ``They've all been undermined by that exasperatingly soft-spoken
Gorbachev, as he insists on retreating from every filmic
battleground from Afghanistan to Angola.''
   Comments Sunday Times TV critic Patrick Stoddart: ``If we are no
longer to be scared of Reds under the bed, what on earth are we
going to read before we turn out the light?''
   The drawing power of Cold War drama remains strong, however, as
shown by ``Game, Set and Match,'' a 13-part television adaptation of
spy novelist Len Deighton's trilogy. Aired in Britain last fall, it
won critical acclaim and high ratings.
   The Deighton trilogy, about a British intelligence agent whose
wife turns out to be a Soviet plant, was written before glasnost
became a household word. But in interviews on the TV set,
co-director Patrick Lau insisted the work was glasnost-inspired in
that ``the enemy is no longer drawn in broadstroke cartoon
characters.''
   Richard Cohen, publishing director of Century-Hutchinson books
and former editor of famed spy novelist John Le Carre, said:
``Writers are having to be a bit more sophisticated. Certain
simplistic political maneuverings as the background to thrillers
can't be used now.''
   He said glasnost is ``wiping the slate clean,'' leaving open the
question of ``where to locate the enemy.''
   Rupert Allason, a Conservative Party lawmaker and espionage
historian, suggests the Middle East, whose secret services ``have a
deep grounding and are every bit as challenging as the KGB was 10 to
20 years ago.''
   Lyall's recently published ``Uncle Target'' is set largely in
Jordan, while his next book will take readers to Morocco and Bermuda.
   Ted Allbeury, 70, a British former intelligence officer who now
writes high-quality spy novels, said the thaw accompanying Moscow's
``openness'' offered richer fodder.
   ``It opens one more door,'' he said in an interview, ``if you can
imagine the war that must be going on ... between the old KGB
operators and the brighter people they're using more.''
   Allason, who writes under the pseudonym Nigel West, told BBC
radio last month: ``It's very difficult in this period to try and go
back to the sinister figure of running spies all around the world.''
   ``The fact is, the newspapers show us every day that they have
failed, and the KGB defections have in effect put Karla (le Carre's
fictional Soviet spymaster) out of business.''
   Not that the Soviet Union as a topic of interest is likely to go
away. ``The basic structure is as old as story-telling,'' said
Richard Cohen. ``It does have a certain form to it.''
   John Gardner, who writes James Bond novels by arrangement with
the estate of Bond creator Ian Fleming, doesn't see glasnost and
perestroika putting Western intelligence out of business.
   ``People say we must find a new evil, and my response to that is
the old one ain't gone away; it's very much still there,'' he said
in an interview.
   ``Just because we have Gorbachev saying wonderful things doesn't
mean we relax any vigilance,'' Gardner said in an interview.
   Former British spy Anthony Cavendish worries that new British
official secrets legislation, which imposes a lifetime ban on secret
agents describing their work, will dry up the source material that
helps spy novelists give their work authenticity. Cavendish's
memoir, ``Inside Intelligence,'' is already banned in Britain.
   But he sees glasnost opening new territory for the spy novel _
``the view from the other side.''
   ``With glasnost in full flood in the Soviet Union,'' he wrote,
``it may not be long before the trickle of spy books appearing there
turns into a flood.''

   A weekend fire in the office of Tony Pokora in the downtown
City-County Building caused his aquarium to shatter. The water
doused the blaze, but his two fish died.
   ``They gave their lives to save the City-County Building,'' said
Pokora, an aide to the city controller.
   The fire, which apparently was started by an electrical

   The National Zoo celebrated its 100th birthday
this week with Barbara Bush leading the noisy hoopla, but over at
the Smithsonian's Insect Zoo, things were so quiet you could
actually hear the giant Madagascar hissing cockroach hiss.
   The silence was broken by shrieks and gasps from a class of
first-graders who gathered round to watch Cleo, the orange-kneed
Mexican tarantula, gobble her weekly meal of a live cricket.
   If you blinked, you'd miss the show. Might these spiders be
desperately hungry on such a spartan diet?
   ``Tarantulas don't burn a lot of calories,'' said Sally Love, the
Insect Zoo's director. ``They just sit around, waiting for something
to bump into them. They can go for a year and a half without eating
anything at all.''
   Miss Love is plainly in love with bugs.
   A George Washington University graduate with a degree in biology,
she postponed plans to get a master's degree and quit her job as a
``grunt'' on Capitol Hill seven years ago to run the tiny Insect Zoo
at the dead-end of a third-floor hallway in the National Museum of
Natural History.
   ``Insects are gaining momentum in popularity for some reason,''
said Miss Love, who has appeared on the Johnny Carson and David
Letterman television shows as well as West German and Canadian TV to
display the biggest, showiest specimens from her zoo.
   ``Everybody has a horror and a fascination with insects,'' she
said. ``But when people try to take a close look at insects, they
say `hmmm, they're not so bad after all.' In fact, they are really
very interesting.''
   Among the dramatic bugs she has chosen for her TV appearances _
she calls them the ``Oh, my's'' because of the audience reaction _
are some of the zoo's 50 or so tarantulas, a whip scorpion from
Arizona, the Giant Walking Stick from New Guinea, three-inch
cockroaches, rare leaf insects from Sri Lanka (whose disguise is to
look like the leaves they are devouring) and scarab beetles and and
cone-headed katydids from Peru.
   To the delight of school children on field trips to the zoo, Miss
Love consents to stare cross-eyed as a giant Madagascar hissing
cockroach crawls up the side of her nose.
   ``For this I went to school?'' she says with a giggle.
   Miss Love receives $20 a week to spend on fresh fruits and
vegetables for her bugs. Most eat things like romaine lettuce and
bananas, but the large milkweed bug prefers sunflower seeds and raw
peanuts.
   The meat eaters _ tarantulas, scorpions, centipedes and the like
_ eat crickets, with an occasional caterpillar or beetle larvae
tossed in for a treat. The tobacco hornworms, of course, like
tobacco. And the giant coconut crabs from the Seychelles in the
Indian Ocean can't get enough of coconut cake, with vitamin-rich
fish food sprinkled on top.
   Miss Love's two staff assistants are augmented by 50 or 60 unpaid
volunteers like Henry Gemmill, 71, retired former managing editor
and Washington bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal.
   Gemmill says he comes in every Thursday to conduct ``a little
horror show for the kiddies.'' He drops a cricket into the tarantula
sandbox and describes ever-so-gently how the spider sucks the
``cricket soup'' from its prey the same way Count Dracula sank his
fangs into beautiful maidens.
   He also informs his young listeners that ``it doesn't seem
entirely fair to me, but in the world of bugs the female has
achieved not only equality but a pretty clear superiority.''
   Female spiders grow bigger and live much longer than males,
Gemmill said, ``and some even eat their husbands.''
   To which a young boy in the crowd responded: ``That's the way it
goes.''

   An 11-year-old girl who abstained from
watching television for a year will receive a $500 reward from her
father, although he's not sure the whole thing was a good idea.
   Rhonda Gruber's no-TV year is up, and her father, Victor, is glad
it's over. He said it split up the family.
   ``If we were watching TV as a family, she wasn't part of the
family; she was in another room reading a book or something,'' he
said recently.
   Rhonda, who is in a gifted-student program at West Fargo South
Elementary School, spent the year reading. In fact, she won a summer
reading program at the local library after plowing through 11,000
pages of text.
   She said she became used to not watching television, but insisted
the boycott won't continue.
   Asked what she would watch for her inaugural program, she said,
``The first thing that's on. I think I'll watch a lot.''

   A cellular telephone salesman who found
a note that a honeymooning couple tossed into the Atlantic Ocean
more than two years ago turned the belated discovery into a sales
pitch.
   Responding to the note, salesman Marc Estrade wrote, ``Your note
on SS Emerald Seas stationery was found Feb. 12, 1989, on Timothy
Beach, St. Kitts. Next time, rent one of our cellular phones.
They're far more reliable.''
   Mike and Kim Harnage of Warner Robins were honeymooning on a
cruise ship when they put a note in a bottle and threw it into the
ocean Nov. 5, 1986.
   Two years of marriage and the recent birth of their daughter had
put the bottled message far in the back of the Harnages' minds. But
after getting a postcard from Estrade on Feb. 20, the couple was
eager to talk with him.
   ``I feel a lot better after talking to the guy,'' said Harnage,
who reached Estrade by telephone Wednesday. Estrade, who lives on
St. Kitts, told him the note was brittle and the bottle was covered
with barnacles.
   There was no immediate word, however, on whether the Harnages
would take Estrade up on his phone offer.
   Estrade made the discovery as he was walking on a beach. St.
Kitts is about 100 miles from the U.S. Virgin Islands and east of
Puerto Rico.
   ``I found it kind of ironic that I would find this primitive form
of communication when I work with state-of-the art equipment,''
Estrade said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: NATO And Warsaw Pact Having Another Go At Arms
Reductions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the NATO alliance and the Warsaw Pact head
into new arms control talks, the gulf between the U.S. and Soviet
approaches is so wide it makes prospects for a quick settlement
uncertain.
   The Western allies, under U.S. leadership, want sharp reductions
on the Eastern side. The idea is to force the Warsaw Pact down to
NATO levels and then cut a little bit more on both sides, by 5
percent to 10 percent.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, have adopted a more dramatic and radical
stance on arms control under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They
are likely to insist on far deeper cuts in non-nuclear forces on
both sides, and across a wider range of weapons.
   The two sides are starting over after 15 years of futile
negotiations to reduce non-nuclear forces in Central Europe. They
have broadened their vistas to cover the entire expanse of the
continent _ from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the
Soviet Union.
   All 35 nations that signed the 1975 Helsinki agreement to reduce
East-West tensions are involved, but the negotiations will be
conducted by the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the 7-nation Warsaw Pact.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is going to Vienna on
Saturday night to kick off the talks, although he will be back home
again before the actual opening on Thursday.
   He will have a chance to compare notes with the other NATO
foreign ministers, and to hold a get-acquainted session with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. They are likely to agree on
a date and an agenda for Baker to make his first trip to Moscow, in
late April or early May.
   The overall improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations is bound to have
a salutary effect on the negotiations. On the other hand, the
opening NATO position would make far deeper cuts in the Warsaw Pact
forces than in the Western alliance and leaves out missiles and
airplanes.
   Assuming the Warsaw Pact went along, the levels of tanks,
anti-aircraft artillery and armored personnel carriers on the two
sides would be only marginally below current NATO strength.
   Jonathan Dean, a former U.S. negotiator, suggested in a report
Thursday for the Union of Concerned Scientists that the proposal
does not go far enough to achieve real cuts in the $300 billion NATO
spends annually on the defense of Europe.
   ``The Pact seems ready for deep cuts, but it wants to see NATO
cut, too,'' Dean said. ``NATO's position would not decisively
achieve stability to reduce the possibility of conflict between the
alliances.''
   James P. Rubin, research director of the private Arms Control
Association, said that ``not only does the Western approach appear
to be one-sided, but the complexity of the negotiations seems
daunting.''
   Rubin, in an interview, said the outcome will depend on whether
the desire of both East and West to reduce their defense burdens is
strong enough ``to enable political leaders to cut through these
inherent technical complexities and differing approaches.''
   If an agreement is ultimately reached, Rubin said, it is likely
to be based on a trade-off of NATO's advantages in quality aircraft
for the Warsaw Pact's overwhelming numerical edge in ground-based
tanks and equipment.
   In the meantime, Gorbachev offered last fall to withdraw six tank
divisions from Eastern Europe and to reduce Soviet manpower in
Europe and Asia. In January, he announced a 14.2 percent reduction
in the defense budget and a 19.5 percent cutback in weapons and
military hardware.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin said at a news conference
Thursday that the troop reductions were unilateral and irreversible.
   However, the NATO proposal would require a 50 percent reduction
in Warsaw Pact tanks. Dubinin was not willing to take up that
challenge. He said the Soviets had the impression ``the real NATO
approach'' to reducing non-nuclear forces in Europe was still being
formulated by the Bush administration.
   ``It would be risky now to discuss it,'' the Soviet diplomat said.

   Audrey Hepburn, who says she has rejected
hundreds of scripts since making ``They All Laughed'' eight years
ago, is looking for a new film role.
   ``It would be fun to do another part before I roll over,'' Ms.
Hepburn, 59, says in next Sunday's issue of Parade magazine.
   ``People are inclined to send scripts to me for which the parts
are too young,'' said Ms. Hepburn. ``I'd love to do a picture with
Michael Caine or Michael Douglas _ actors who have style but aren't
pompous about it.''
   She said she still remembers how her introverted personality made
performing difficult. ``Oh, I liked it beforehand _ all the
preparation _ and I liked it afterward, if it went well. But the
thing itself is scary.''

   James Garner and James Woods say their
television movie ``Promise'' will be a tough act to follow, but they
believe they have found the right project for a successful return to
the small screen.
   ``My Name is Bill W.,'' a story about the founder of Alcoholics
Anonymous, went into production Monday and is the first pairing of
the two since ``Promise.''
   Woods won an Emmy for his performance in ``Promise,'' the story
of a man who cares for his mentally retarded younger brother after
their mother's death. He says the toughest part of the new movie
will be illustrating the spiritual aspect of an alcoholic's recovery.
   Woods is cast as Bill Wilson, a failed stockbroker who founded
Alcoholics Anonymous in the 1930s. Garner makes a guest appearance
as the co-founder.

   Former baseball player Steve Garvey, involved in
paternity battles with two former lovers, has resigned as a
University of San Diego trustee.
   The private Catholic university released a short statement
Thursday confirming Garvey's resignation, but gave no reason for his
departure.
   Garvey was unavailable for comment, his receptionist said.
   Garvey, 40, a 10-time All Star who played first base for the Los
Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres during his 17-year career, last
week was named by two women as the father of their children.
   One baby was born Feb. 15 in San Diego to an unidentified woman.
Also claiming a pregnancy by Garvey is Rebecka Mendenhall of Atlanta.
   Garvey recently broke his engagement with Mendenhall and married
another woman. He has said he will accept financial responsibility
should either child prove to be his.

   Billionaire Donald Trump is once again being
picked on in a nationally syndicated cartoon strip.
   ``Bill the Cat,'' a frumpy feline featured in ``Bloom County,''
has acquired Trump's brain in the lastest series.
   Trump was asked about the transplant earlier this week.
   ``I've never heard of `Bloom County,''' he said, and asked what
the strip was about.
   The strip currently focuses on Bill, who got the transplanted
brain when Trump was crushed by an anchor of his yacht, the Trump
Princess.
   In recent weeks, Trump has expressed displeasure at being the
centerpiece of cartoonist Gary Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' strip.

   Elizabeth Taylor has confirmed she spent time in
the Betty Ford Clinic after suffering a back injury, the first time
the actress has publicly acknowledged her stay at the California
rehabilitation center.
   ``It has taken a long time to heal and even longer to learn to
live with it,'' Taylor said in a two-paragraph statement issued
Thursday. ``During this time I was in the Betty Ford Clinic for a
brief time ... and I am fine now!''
   Taylor, 57, said she suffered a compression fracture of the first
lumbar vertebra. But neither she nor her publicist would say if
prescription drugs for that injury put Taylor into the drug and
alcohol rehabilitation clinic.
   Tabloids had reported that Taylor had gone to the center last
year, but this was the actress' first public statement about it,
said publicist Lucinda Marshall.

   A judge has denied a request by the
ex-wife of Grammy Award-winning jazz saxophonist Stan Getz to have
his celebrity status considered marital property in their divorce
proceedings.
   In a decision made public Thursday, state Supreme Court Justice
Nicholas Colabella said Getz's status was worth little because of
his ill health.
   According to the court papers, Getz, 60, suffers from liver
cancer, lymphoma and cirrhosis of the liver.
   Getz's doctor testified that Getz probably has two years to live
and ``it is unlikely plaintiff will be able to pursue his livelihood
as a performer in any substantial way.''
   Getz was granted a divorce from Monica Getz, his wife of 31
years, after a trial in which the couple traded allegations of
adultery and abuse.
   Colabella ruled that Mrs. Getz did not sacrifice a medical career
to help her husband, as she testified, and that she was entitled
only to equal distribution of marital property, including the sale
of their $1.8 million Tarrytown estate and royalties due for Getz's
records.
   Getz is an artist in residence at Stanford University, receiving
$45,000 a year. He gained gold record status with his 1966 hit ``The
Girl from Ipanema.''

<HEAD>Bush Offers New Central America Policy; Rewards for Nicaragua Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is proposing a new U.S.
policy toward Central America that includes rewards for Nicaragua if
it passes certain ``checkpoints'' on the road to democracy, say
congressional and administration sources.
   While still in its formative stages, the new policy is outlined
in a secret 10-page document Secretary of State James A. Baker III
showed to House and Senate leaders Thursday during a hastily
arranged visit to Capitol Hill.
   Baker made clear to lawmakers that he does not intend to abandon
the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, who now are subsisting on U.S.
supplies in Honduran jungle camps along the Nicaraguan border.
   He told congressional officials he would seek to renew the U.S.
``humanitarian'' aid, which runs out at the end of this month, for a
year, according to some present at the meetings. Aid would continue
to flow at current rates _ about $4 million a month _ and would keep
the rebels available as a standby fighting force until after
Nicaragua's national elections, which are being moved up to early
1990.
   But some participants said it was clear that the one-year
extension would be objectionable to congressional Democrats who
oppose the Contra policy, and that it might be negotiable. Baker's
top objective for Central America remains to achieve a bipartisan
consensus on how to achieve democracy and peace in the region, the
participants said.
   ``They're trying to put something together that everybody can
agree on, that both Democrats and Republicans can support,'' said
Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who attended one meeting in the office
of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   At the same time Baker was making the rounds, Guatemalan
President Vinicio Cerezo also was calling on some of the same
congressional leaders to ask stronger U.S. support for last month's
regional peace agreement reached in El Salvador among the five
Central American presidents.
   The pact calls for drafting a plan by mid-May that would disband
the 11,000-man Contra force and provide for them to be assimilated
into Nicaragua as the Sandinistas open up and democratize their
political process, free political prisoners and hold new elections.
   Bush has been cool to the plan, saying it is similar to past
Sandinista promises which have not been kept and contains no
enforcement mechanism to make sure the reforms are achieved. Bush
reiterated his skepticism to Cerezo in a meeting on Thursday, said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the United States
should support the plan and seek to propel it forward. ``We ought to
be positive and supportive, and not pour cold water on it,'' Wright
said before a meeting with Cerezo.
   But Wright, in a statement that seemed to fit in with Baker's
proposal, added: ``We have some leverage we can apply at the proper
moment to reinforce the agreement and help make it work.''
   Wright said that leverage could include lifting the current U.S.
trade embargo on Nicaragua.
   Sources in the administration and on Capitol Hill, all speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Baker was considering lifting that
embargo as well as offering small economic incentives to help
Nicaragua's failing economy if the Sandinistas live up to their
pledges of democratization.
   Baker is also considering a range of possible U.S. actions that
could include resumption of normalized relations on visas, air
travel, foreign aid and exchange of diplomats, said one
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   While current aid to the Contras officially runs out March 31,
supplies that have been bought by that date could continue to flow
to the rebels and keep them supplied at least through April,
congressional sources said. While the adinistration may propose its
new aid package before Congress leaves town March 23 for a 10-day
Easter break, it is unlikely action will come before April.
   Baker's discussions on Capitol Hill were seen in part as an
effort to get moving on Central America amid accusations that Bush
has been slow to get his foreign policy machinery off the ground.
The administration apparently was taken by surprise by the agreement
reached Feb. 14 by the five presidents in Costa del Sol, El
Salvador, and is scrambling to catch up.
   The five countries are Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras and Nicaragua.
   ``Part of what's driving them (the Central American presidents)
is our own policy vacuum,'' said an administration source who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``They had no idea what our policy was
when they met.''
   Baker's discussions with Congress were ``to get us out of this
vacuum,'' the source said.
   Some congressional critics noted as well that the policy
proposals apparently had not yet been cleared with the Contras or
the Central American presidents. ``This is a Washington plan, not a
Central American plan,'' said one Republican source.

<HEAD>Labor and Business Await Bush Decision on Airline Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision on whether to
intervene in the threatened Eastern Airlines strike will show
whether he wants to improve relations with organized labor, a union
president says.
   Vincent Sombrotto, head of the National Association of Letter
Carriers, said that if Bush appoints an emergency investigative
board and delays the strike by 60 days, ``that would show a
recognition of American labor as an institution.''
   But if Bush refuses to invoke the law, Sombrotto said, ``that
would just be consistent with the Reagan administration's
laissez-faire attitude.''
   Former President Reagan responded to his first labor-management
crisis in August 1981 by firing some 11,400 striking air traffic
controllers, and Reagan's relations with organized labor suffered
throughout two terms.
   Now, the specter of a strike at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday has
forced Bush to decide whether he wants to invoke provisions of the
Railway Labor Act to impose a 60-day cooling off period.
   Alfred Kahn, who headed the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board
and was chairman of the Council on Wage and Price Stability during
the Carter administration, said it would be a mistake to intervene.
   But Audrey Freeman, an analyst with the private Conference Board
in New York, said she doubted that Bush's decision either way would
make a major statement about his intentions toward labor.
   ``I don't think the controllers strike changed the course of
history of labor-management relations,'' she said, ``and I don't
think that whatever Mr. Bush will do will change the course of labor
relations.''
   At midnight, the end of a 30-day cooling-off period set by the
National Mediation Board, Eastern can impose work conditions and the
union can strike. The board recommended that Bush name the emergency
panel.
   Kahn, who was instrumental in the late 1970s move to ease
government regulation of the airline industry and increase
competition, said, ``I think that if the Bush administration
succumbs, and appoints this board ... it would be tipping the scales
in favor of labor. It would be such a labor-dictated intervention it
could be seen as killing Eastern.''
   Kahn, in a telephone interview from the campus of New York
University, said ``the more they (the unions) can delay either a
strike or the probability of a settlement, the more they can
increase the chances of Eastern going under.''
   Mark de Bernardo, special counsel to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said the union movement is ``going to unduly pressure the
new administration ... by raising the stakes'' in situations such as
the Eastern dispute.
   ``It's a fairly dangerous gambit, forcing this into an early
bellwether of where the Bush administration is going to go'' in the
area of labor-relations, he said. ``Government intervention was not
a hallmark of the Reagan administration.
   ``If he (Bush) makes the decision to intervene, it will be a
reluctant one,'' de Bernardo said.
   Sombrotto acknowledged that ``it's a little unusual'' for
organized labor to urge government intervention to stop a strike _
which is the ultimate weapon of unionized workers. But he said that
``it is a little different period.'' He said a strike would be
detrimental to ``the flying public'' and to the economy, as well as
to the Eastern Airlines employees.
   In contrast to earlier years, when the organized labor movement
was much stronger, the AFL-CIO has urged Bush to use this law to
delay a strike. In days past, government intervention to stop a
strike would have infuriated labor leaders. At the same time, Frank
Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air Corp., which owns Eastern, has
warned that putting off planned cuts in costs could send the carrier
to ``the corporate graveyard.''

   A University of Oregon senior faces a
contempt of court charge for enclosing a letter with a parking fine
in which he complained in mostly vulgar terms about having to pay.
   Jeffrey Sebastian, 23, said he was angry about the fine because
he received the parking ticket while taking a required exam. He
suggested, in a letter peppered mostly with profanities, that the
city should coordinate parking with the school when exams are
scheduled.
   ``The emotion did slip,'' Sebastian said about the letter, which
he claims is an expression of constitutionally protected free
speech. ``But that doesn't change the feelings that I felt.''
   After Municipal Judge Frank Bocci read the letter, he ordered
Sebastian to show cause why he shouldn't be held in contempt ``for
disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the judge and
court.''
   Now Sebastian faces the prospect of a $25 fine or 10 days in jail.
   ``I felt it was offensive to the proper judicial operation of the
court and to what's referred to as the dignity of the court,'' Bocci
said this week. He added that it was the first time in 24 years on
the bench that he's issued a contempt citation against someone for
writing a letter.
   The case was heard this week by Pro Tem Judge Jim Spickerman
after Bocci disqualified himself from the case to avoid any bias.
   Floyd Prozanski Jr., a city prosecutor, admitted there were no
Oregon cases dealing with the issue but he cited cases in New Jersey
that appeared to offer some guidance.
   However, defense attorney Steve Chez cited another New Jersey
case that concluded with a pair of rhyming couplets:
   ``Statutory attempts to regulate pure bluster,
   Can't pass what is called constitutional muster.
   Use of vulgar words that may cause resentment,
   Is protected by the First Amendment.''
   A decision is expected next week.

<HEAD>Poet Laureate Nemerov Honors Congress with His Verse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poet Laureate Howard Nemerov says writing a
poem about Congress was ``a real hard test,'' but he thinks the 28
lines he penned to help the House and Senate observe their 200th
anniversary served the purpose.
   Nemerov read his poem at a joint meeting of the two Houses
Thursday _ held early because the bicentennial of March 4, 1789,
when the first Congress met in New York, will fall on a Saturday
when Congress is not in session.
   ``I think the historian of Congress was the one who transmitted
the invitation, and I said, `Well, what the hell, have a go,
Howard,''' said the poet.
   ``I'm not a romantic poet, but I don't mind trying to do a decent
job of whatever comes up, and if I can't do it, I won't,'' he said.
   The House historian, Raymond Smock, said he asked Nemerov about
three weeks ago if he would write the poem.
   ``I simply called him up and told him we would like to have this
happen, and he was delighted,'' he said. ``You could see that
already the wheels were turning and he was thinking about Congress
and saw it, I think, as a challenge.''
   Nemerov said it wasn't any cinch turning out a poem about
Congress in three weeks.
   ``It cost a lot of blood and sweat to do it,'' he said. ``If
there were time, I would have told the Congress, `I was brought up
to believe that no subject was intrinsically unpoetical, but you
ladies and gents gave me a real hard test.' However, I think I done
all right.''
   Smock said the lawmakers ``thought it was just the right touch.''
   Nemerov's poem, entitled ``To the Congress of the United States
Entering its Third Century,'' ends with the lines:
   ``So it's a republic, as Franklin said,
   ``If you can keep it; and we did
   ``This far, and hope to keep our quarrel
   ``Funny and just, though with this moral:
   ``Praise without end for the go-ahead zeal
   ``Of whoever it was invented the wheel;
   ``But never a word for the poor soul's sake
   ``That thought ahead, and invented the brake.''
   Nemerov is the third person to serve as poet laureate, following
Robert Penn Warren and Richard Wilbur, under a 1986 law adding that
title to the 50-year-old position of consultant in poetry to the
Library of Congress.
   The law includes a clause that provides, ``Each department and
office of the federal government is encouraged to make use of the
services of the poet laureate for ceremonial and other occasions of
celebration.''
   Poets took exception when the law was written.
   ``I can see all sorts of terrible things possibly happening,''
Stanley Kunitz, the 1979 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for poetry,
said at a conference at George Washington University.
   ``Relations between politics and poetry have been almost always
destructive to poetry,'' added Josephine Jacobsen, like Kunitz a
former Library of Congress poetry consultant.
   But Nemerov says he never heard of such a provision.
   Smock said he and other Bicentennial planners knew what the law
said, but that wasn't why they decided to ask Nemerov if he would
write a poem.
   ``It was more a feeling that this occasion called for a poetic
expression,'' said Smock.
   ``I don't know what's happened to poetry,'' Smock said. ``It
seems to have retreated to our universities, and its not something
that's done publicly like it used to be. We thought it would be
delightful to afford the poet laureate an opportunity if he was
willing.''

   May you all continue to deserve, and have.
   
   Here at the fulcrum of us all,
   The feather of truth against the soul
   Is weighed, and had better be found to balance
   Lest our enterprise collapse in silence.
   
   For here the million varying wills
   Get melted down, get hammered out
   Until the movie's reduced to stills
   That tell us what the law's about.
   
   Conflict's endemic in the mind:
   Your job's to hear it in the wind
   And compass it in opposites,
   And bring the antagonists by your wits
   
   To being one, and that the law
   Thenceforth, until you change your minds
   Against and with the shifting winds
   That this and that way blow the straw.
   
   So it's a republic, as Franklin said,
   If you can keep it; and we did
   Thus far, and hope to keep our quarrel

<HEAD>Budget Crunch Threatens to Pull Plug on Satellites</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The future looks cloudy for the Landsat
satellites that keep on eye on the earth and its climate, with
shutdown likely by the end of the month unless more money can be
found.
   Congress only provided enough money to run the system through the
end of March and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
doesn't have any extra funds to keep them going, NOAA satellite
director Thomas N. Pyke Jr., said Thursday.
   As a result, the contractor that runs the satellites for the
government has been directed to begin shutting them down, Pyke said
in a telephone interview.
   A Landsat satellite scheduled for launch in 1991 is not affected.
   But Sen. Al Gore Jr., D-Tenn., blamed the decision on the
administration and called the funding halt ``one of the most
ridiculous policy decisions I have seen in 13 years of service in
the House and Senate.''
   ``At a time when we are trying to get more information about
environmental change, the Bush administration is shutting down one
of our best sources of information,'' said Gore, chairman of the
Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee on Science,
Technology and Space.
   All Landsat services, including access to more than 2 million
archive images of the planet, will cease March 15, the Earth
Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT) announced.
   ``If this is carried to completion, near the end of this month
they will actually pull the switch on these two satellites and place
them on internal control,'' Pyke said. ``Once that has been done it
may not be possible to reestablish communications with these
satellites.''
   In the meantime, however, the House Science, Space and Technology
Committee has called a hearing for next Tuesday to look into ways of
saving the satellite system.
   ``It makes absolutely no sense'' to shut down the satellites,
said Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., a committee member. He called on
President Bush to intercede immediately by asking the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the departments of Defense
and Agriculture to help fund the program.
   EOSAT Vice President Peter M. P. Norris termed the threatened
shutdown ``beyond belief.''
   ``The Landsat program provides important environmental data that
touches on projects throughout the world,'' Norris said.
   But, explained Pyke: ``We have gone to the other federal agencies
who make use of Landsat data and asked them if they can help with
the continued funding of Landsat operations, but as of today we have
received no additional funds from any source.''
   Currently, EOSAT operates two satellites, Landsats 4 and 5, which
provide photos used for a variety of purposes including mineral
exploration, checking soil conditions and vegetation, urban and
rural planning, monitoring volcanoes, tracing ocean currents and so
forth.
   Both satellites are well past their expected lifetimes and are
not fully operational, Pyke noted, but they are still providing
useful information.
   An improved satellite, Landsat 6, is under construction, Pyke
added. That project will continue because funds were provided to
complete and launch that satellite, which is expected to go into
service in 1991.
   EOSAT was established to take over Landsat operations in 1985
after the Reagan Administration sought to sell both Landsat and the
nation's weather satellites to commercial operators.
   Congress refused to approve sale of the weather satellites, but
permitted the Landsat sale, with federal support to be phased out
over five years.
   EOSAT has struggled financially in recent years, facing strong
competition from the French SPOT-Image satellite system and also the
possibility of civilian sales of satellite images by the Soviet
Union.

<HEAD>Bailout Cost Could Be Higher than Bush Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The cost to taxpayers of President Bush's
savings and loan plan could jump by more than a third if the
administration's economic assumptions turn out to be too optimistic,
the White House budget director says.
   Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
acknowledged on Thursday that economic projections showing interest
rates declining by 5 percentage points over the next five years are
optimistic
   But the administration's plan to close and sell off insolvent
savings institutions has a $10 billion to $15 billion ``fudge
factor'' that should accommodate any increase in costs caused by
higher interest rates, he told the Senate Banking Committee.
   Darman said if interest rates stay on average 2 percentage points
above what the administration projects, budget outlays for the S&amp;L
plan from 1989 through 1999 would rise from $39.9 billion to $50.6
billion.
   And if deposits at S&amp;Ls grow at a 4 percent annual rate instead
of the 7 percent forecast, budget outlays would swell by another
$4.7 billion to make up for a lower level of deposit insurance
premiums, he said.
   Darman vigorously defended Bush's proposal to borrow S&amp;L rescue
money in a way that keeps $50 billion in spending out of the budget
deficit.
   Darman said adding $50 billion to the deficit would risk a larger
crisis while Congress and the administration tried to agree on how
to meet the targets of the Gramm-Rudman law.
   ``I think it could well bring the political system to
stalemate,'' he said. ``The net effect of that would be to drive
interest rates up higher (and) force us into recession.''
   In other S&amp;L developments:
   _The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took control of 37 more
insolvent S&amp;Ls, bringing the total under its supervision to 73. The
37 were in six states: 12 in Texas, 10 in Kansas, eight in Arkansas,
four in Louisiana, two in Alaska and one in Maryland.
   Although the FDIC regulates commercial banks, it is taking over
the 220 worst-off S&amp;Ls in preparation for the regulatory
reorganization proposed by Bush.
   _Former Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and Rep.
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking Committee,
backed a liberal coalition's proposal to require financial
institutions to commit money to low-and moderate-income housing as a
concession for an S&amp;L bailout.
   The coalition would finance its proposal by boosting the top
federal income tax rate from 33 percent to 38 percent and by making
assessments on brokerage firms and mutual funds, as well as banks
and S&amp;Ls.
   _Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady won the support of a major
banking group for the administration S&amp;L plan. The board of the
American Bankers Association voted unanimously to work for the plan
even though it would nearly double deposit insurance premiums paid
by banks.
   The ABA's support was conditioned on the eventual granting of
partial premium rebates and on capping the premium at 15 cents per
$100 of deposits. The administration proposal would permit
regulators, if necessary, to raise the premium as high as 35 cents.
   _The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative agency,
told a House panel that ``junk bonds'' have been a profitable
investment for S&amp;Ls, but warned that their safety hasn't been tested
during an economic downturn.
   The GAO told the House Banking subcommittee that the nation's
S&amp;Ls, had invested about $13 billion in junk bonds as of Sept. 30.
The bonds pay higher interest but carry a greater risk of default.
   On another point, Darman said the administration is forecasting
that 200 of the nation's 2,950 S&amp;Ls will fail because they will be
unable to meet stricter capital standards requiring S&amp;L owners to
put up more of their own money within two years. That's in addition
to the 350 that have already failed and are awaiting closure.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
supervising 73 savings institutions after taking control of an
additional 37 S&amp;Ls in six states.
   Although the FDIC regulates commercial banks, it began on Feb. 7
to take over the 220 shakiest S&amp;Ls in preparation for the regulatory
reorganization proposed by President Bush.
   Of the 37 put under the FDIC on Thursday, 12 were in Texas, 10 in
Kansas, eight in Arkansas, four in Louisiana, two in Alaska and one
in Maryland. They have assets totaling $7.9 billion.
   The goal of the takeovers is to clamp down on above-market
interest rates offered by the failed institutions, root out any
undiscovered fraud and prevent the institutions from expanding or
taking excessive risks.
   The FDIC is emphasizing that the institutions will remain open
for business as usual and that all accounts are protected up to the
$100,000 deposits insurance limit.
   The 37, listed by state, are:
   Alaska: First Federal Bank of Alaska and Home Savings Bank, both
of Anchorage.
   Arkansas: Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, Augusta;
First Federal Savings and Loan Association, Fayetteville; Landmark
Savings Bank, Hot Springs; First Federal Savings and Loan
Association, Malvern; First State Savings Bank and Home Federal
Savings and Loan Association, both Mountain Home; Commonwealth

<HEAD>Fed Chief Says Money Moves Have Kept Inflation at Bay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan insists
that the Fed's anti-inflation moves have been proper despite
criticism that its tight-money policy could topple the country into
a recession, .
   Greenspan told the House Budget Committee on Thursday that he did
not believe forcing the country into a recession was a proper way to
fight inflation and he said that was not the Fed's intention.
   But he said if the central bank had not been pursuing a policy of
gradually pushing up interest rates since March of last year,
inflationary pressures would be much more severe at the current time.
   If inflation gets out of control, the Fed is forced to squeeze
credit much tighter, driving interest rates even higher and making
any economic downturn much more severe.
   That is what occurred in 1981-82, when the country suffered
through the most drastic recession since the Great Depression, as
then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker drove interest rates higher and
higher to combat the worst bout of inflation since the Civil War.
   Greenspan indicated that the Fed's current course was aimed at
making sure that the next recession will not have to be as severe.
   ``I do believe that the business cycle has not been repealed,''
Greenspan said. ``We will at some point get a recession, but I hope
that we have correct policies in place so the recession will be
mild.''
   Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., noted that there was a
difference of opinion on the Fed's credit-tightening moves, which
included a decision last Friday to boost to 7 percent the discount
rate, the interest the central bank charges to make loans to
financial institutions.
   ``Opinion seems divided whether this move was `too little, too
late' or `too much, too soon,' '' Panetta said.
   Panetta said that regardless of whether the higher interest rates
end up pushing the country into a recession, the credit tightening
will have many adverse consequences, including a bigger budget
deficit, more troubles for the savings and loan industry, higher
debt payments by Third World countries and higher costs to consumers
who borrow to purchase homes and autos.
   But Greenspan said the central bank remained convinced that the
dangers of doing nothing outweighed risks to specific sectors of the
economy from higher interest rates.
   On another matter, Greenspan said he still supported increasing
the federal gasoline tax but only as a conservation measure, not as
a way of boosting federal revenues.
   Greenspan also said that boosting taxes on alcoholic beverages
and cigarettes would not harm the economy, but he said simply
increasing federal tax revenues was not the answer the government's
imbalance between spending and revenues.
   Echoing a position taken by President Bush and former President
Reagan, Greenspan said that higher federal revenues were much more
likely to end up funding new programs rather than being used to
reduce the budget deficit.
   ``There is a tendency in Congress, when revenues are available,
to increase government programs,'' Greenspan said.
   Greenspan said he would prefer across-the-board spending cuts to
tax increases if Congress and the administration fail to agree on a
plan to reduce the 1990 budget deficit to $100 billion.
   Greenspan repeated warnings that he has made in earlier
congressional appearances that it is crucial that Congress and the
new administration reach agreement on a credible, multi-year plan to
reduce the budget deficit.
   He said there was ``no question'' that such a deficit-reduction
program would encourage financial investors and allow long-term
interest rates to fall substantially.

<HEAD>Head of SSI Defends Current Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of a federal program that provides
a thin financial cushion to the elderly and the infirm opposes
congressional moves to expand the eligibility rolls.
   Michael Carozza, deputy commissioner of the Social Security
Administration, told a joint hearing of two House committees on
Thursday that the current program works.
   ``I don't think it would particularly help this problem,''
Carozza told Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., when asked about a bill in
Congress to ease restrictions to benefits under the Supplemental
Security Assistance program.
   ``SSI is an effective safety net, providing the aged, blind, and
disabled with a floor of income, the value of which is enhanced when
combined with Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance,'' Carozza
said.
   He shared a witness table with social workers and a 97-year-old
Indianapolis woman who lives on $13 a day in SSI benefits who also
testified before the House Select Committee on Aging and the Ways
and Means human resources subcommittee.
   Created in 1972, SSI is operated by the Social Security
Administration as a supplement for those who get federal benefits
such as food stamps and Medicare but have little or no other income
to live on. Some 4{ million people received $10.7 billion in
benefits last year, according to the SSA.
   Parents of severely disabled children are eligible under some
circumstances, although 45 percent of the recipients are over 65.
   But Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., called the program ``a failed
guarantee against poverty.''
   ``Although the program's concept and structure are basically
sound, the current level of federal assistance does not provide
recipients with an income that even brings them up to the poverty
line,'' said Matsui.
   And Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Aging, said SSI ``is in fact characterized by
inadequate benefit levels, large gaps in service, insufficient
outreach activities and overly rigid eligibility requirements.''
   He and social workers cited numerous stories of recipients going
two years or more without benefits, and then barely able to live on
the $368 maximum monthly benefit. ``This is less than 75 percent of
the poverty level,'' said Roybal.
   Carozza said, however, ``I believe this is appropriate when you
consider that SSI intends to be an income of last resort.''

<HEAD>Common Market Agrees To Chlorfluorocarbon Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Common Market has agreed to cut its
use of chlorofluorocarbons, the synthetic compounds that destroy the
Earth's ozone layer, by 85 percent and seek a total ban on its
production by the end of the century.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, invented in 1930, are used in aerosol
sprays, refrigeration coolants, cleaning agents and several other
products. The compounds are blamed for depletion of the ozone layer
that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays and
for an increase in skin cancer.
   Environmental officials meeting in Brussels agreed Thursday to
give the 12 EEC member nations a mandate to completely phase out the
manufacture and use of the compounds by the year 2000.
   In Washington, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator
William Reilly urged President Bush to support the
chlorofluorocarbon phase-out by the end of the century. But his
proposal was not immediately endorsed by the administration, the
Washington Post reported today.
   The EEC member states are responsible for about half the world's
annual chlorofluorocarbon production of 1 million tons, with Britain
leading in both production and exports, according to the
London-based environmental group Greenpeace.
   The commission will represent the 12 nations at international
conferences being held this year to discuss the ozone issue and to
monitor application of an international accord called the Montreal
Protocol.
   This protocol, signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32, took
effect Jan. 1 and is intended to reduce the production and use of
chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent from current levels by 1998.
   On Sunday, scientists, industrialists and government officials
from around the world will gather in London to discuss how to
eliminate chlorofluorocarbons, which also are blamed for damaging
crops and forests by depleting the protective ozone shield.
   British Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley said more than 110
countries have accepted Britain's invitation to attend the three-day
conference, entitled ``Saving the Ozone Layer.''
   Several countries, including the United States, have banned use
of the compounds in aerosol propellants, and Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said Thursday that Britain will soon require all new
refrigerators to contain substances that will not harm the ozone
layer.
   Britain will lobby other nations to do the same, Ridley said. He
said emphasis will be placed on developing countries such as India
and China, which are beginning mass production of refrigerators and
other consumer goods containing the compounds.
   Greenpeace says Britain exported chlorofluorocarbons to 117
countries in 1988, 81 of which had not signed the Montreal Protocol.
   Thirty-one countries have agreed to reduce their emissions by 50
percent by the end of the century. Britain already has vowed to cut
its emissions in half by the end of this year and to reduce total
emissions by 85 percent by 1999.
   In Tokyo, a government official said today that the government
has urged domestic companies to reduce their dependency on
chlorfluorocarbons, or CFCs, before regulations restricting their
use become mandatory.
   Beginning in July, Japan will regulate the production and import
of CFCs in compliance with the Montreal Protocol.
   Chlorofluorocarbons and related chemicals known as halons, which
are used in firefighting equipment, can last 100 years. They are
stable and non-toxic at lower levels but when they reach the
stratosphere, 15-25 miles up, they are broken up by ultraviolet
radiation and their chlorine atoms destroy the ozone.
   Over the Antarctic, an ozone hole _ an area where ozone has been
seriously depleted _ is worsening, according to the British
government's Stratospheric Ozone Review Group. The group reported
that ozone concentration in the winter was reduced by 95 percent in
some parts.
   An international expedition warned in February that the
atmosphere over the Arctic region is also primed for a large
destruction of ozone.
   The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported
last year that annual ozone depletion over the Northern Hemisphere's
mid-latitudes is much higher than thought. The protective shield
appears to have shrunk by 2.3 percent since 1969 over the area,
which includes most of the United States and Canada, NASA said.
   Scientists say a thinning of the ozone layer increases the
incidence of skin cancer. According to Greenpeace, each 1 percent
depletion is estimated to increase incidence of skin cancer by about
4 percent.
   The London conference, to be opened by Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi, will be addressed first by scientists studying ozone
depletion, then from industrialists developing safe alternatives for
some compounds.
   Another conference is scheduled in Helskinki, Finland, on May 2-5
to monitor application of the Montreal protocol.

<HEAD>Derwinski Confirmed as First Head of Veterans Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Derwinski will become the first
secretary of veterans affairs after a key senator said the former
lawmaker could probably ``rise above'' a dangerous breach of
confidentiality he committed 12 years ago.
   The Senate voted 94-0 on Thursday to confirm Derwinski, whose new
Veterans Affairs Department will be the government's largest
department second only to the Pentagon.
   Derwinski will be head of the Veterans Administration until it
becomes a Cabinet department on March 15. It will have 240,000
employees.
   The Senate confirmed Derwinski after the Veterans Affairs
Committee voted 10-0 the same day to clear the nomination.
   ``I appreciate the unanimous endorsement of the committee and
will now focus my efforts to work for America's veterans,'' said
Derwinski, 62.
   Derwinski, a State Department official until chosen to head the
Veterans Administration in December, served 12 terms in an Illinois
congressional seat before losing it to redistricting in 1982. An
Army veteran, he served in the Japanese occupation of 1945 and 1946.
   In the final tally in the full Senate, those not voting were
Sens. David Boren, D-Okla.; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Al Gore,
Jr., D-Tenn.; Bob Packwood, R-Ore.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; and Timothy
Wirth, D-Colo.
   Derwinski was questioned during his confirmation hearings about
an incident in 1977 when he was the senior Republican on a House
committee investigating bribery of members of Congress by the Korean
government.
   He told the committee on Wednesday he inadvertently mentioned in
a conversation with a Korean diplomat on or near the steps of a
House office building that a Korean official was going to testify
before the committee.
   The Korean Central Intelligence Agency official became a
protected witness, and FBI agents picked him up 30 minutes before
KCIA officials arrived at his home, according to accounts of the
incident.
   Derwinski denied being the source of the tip until confirmation
hearings for a State Department post in 1983 after 12 terms in the
House as an Illinois Republican. The hearings and his admission
attracted practically no public attention at the time.
   When weighed against Derwinski's 30 years of service in Congress
and the State Department, ``I do not find his indiscretions as to
this one incident to be disqualifying,'' said Committee Chairman
Alan Cranston, D-Calif. ``I am optimistic about Mr. Derwinski's
potential to rise above this unattractive episode, to put it behind
him once and for all.
   ``I do not find his indiscretions as to this one incident to be
disqualifying,'' Cranston said after concluding that ``what he did
in 1977 was wrong and that the entire record demonstrates that he
has often not been candid or forthcoming about it.''
   Derwinski was scheduled Monday to appear before the committee
again, but this time to discuss budgetary matters.
   Derwinski said ``there was nothing malicious or intentional to
what I did,'' and contended, ``I honestly do not believe I ever
endangered anyone.
   ``I also acknowledge it wasn't a very wise thing to do _ in fact
a rather stupid thing to do,'' Derwinski said. This was the only
such conversation, he said.

<HEAD>Bush Could Make or Break Public Election Fund in 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush could keep the federal campaign
fund afloat if he decides to run for re-election, but the Treasury
may fall $72 million short when it is to pay for the 1996
presidential contest, a congressional panel was told.
   The fund that pays for the presidential campaigns is facing a
shortfall because fewer people are marking the box on their income
tax returns that would put $1 of their taxes into the kitty, members
of the Federal Election Commission said.
   Bush's presence in the 1992 campaign could be counted upon to
keep other Republicans from running, thus reducing the amount of
money the federal government would have to pay, Lee Ann Elliott,
vice chairman of the Federal Election Commission told a House
Appropriations subcommittee.
   ``But if anything would happen so that it would be an open race,
as it was last time, there would be a shortfall,'' she said.
   The Treasury's luck probably will run out in 1996, when a crowded
field of candidates in both parties can be expected to run for an
open seat in the White House _ as was the case last year.
   ``We predict that there will be a $72 million shortfall'' in
1996, she said.
   Last year, when there were more than a dozen candidates seeking
the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, the federal
government spent some $176 million to cover the campaigns for the
primaries and general election, as well as paying for the parties'
national conventions.
   About $54 million was left over, but while that sounds like a
lot, it was the smallest carryover in more than a decade, said Fred
Eiland, a spokesman for the commission.
   The commission, which was presenting its fiscal 1990 budget
request to the committee, asked for $250,000 to start an education
campaign, largely through public service announcements and
advertising, to remind people to check the box on their federal
income tax returns to put $1 of their taxes into the presidential
campaign fund.
   Under federal law, the Treasury is to pay for the costs of the
general election campaigns for president, the costs of the major
parties' national conventions, and to provide matching funds in the
primaries to presidential candidates who reach a certain level of
voter support and fund-raising ability.
   The first to feel the pinch would be presidential candidates
running in the primaries, Eiland said. While the law requires
specific amounts to be spent on the general election and the
conventions, there is flexibility in how much would be spent on the
primary campaigns.
   Historically presidential campaigns rely heavily on an infusion
of cash from the federal government during the primary campaigns
because that is when the field of candidates is most crowded and
political contributors are most divided.
   Since 1980, however, contributions to the presidential campaign
fund have declined as fewer people marked the box on their tax forms.
   In 1981, the high-water mark for the fund, 28.7 percent of the
1980 income tax returns used the checkoff, putting $41 million into
the campaign fund, Eiland said. Participation dropped to 27 percent
a year later, giving $39 million to the fund.
   By last year, participation had fallen to 21 percent with $33
million going into the presidential campaign fund, he said.
   Congress set up the fund in 1972, and the 1976 presidential
election was the first to be financed with public money.

<HEAD>Holes In Cows For Feed Test Prompts Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swedish research project in which two
cows had holes sliced in their stomachs to test different types of
food has prompted protests by animal rights activists.
   Swedish papers Thursday published pictures of one of the cows,
Norma, with a hole into her flank that was large enough for a man to
put in his arm and insert a plastic feed bag into her stomach.
   The study at Skara Veterinary Hospital was to determine whether
cows could convert as much nourishment from domestic feed as from
imported grains.
   The feed bags, similar to tea bags, are inserted and withdrawn
several times a day. In between, the holes are closed with plastic
plugs.
   The study involves 40 cows, half fed Swedish-grown foodstuffs and
the rest on imported grains.
   The Animal Protection Board in Goteborg expressed dismay at the
project, and the research farm reportedly was flooded with letters
from offended citizens.
   ``I can understand if many people react negatively to this. But I
can guarantee that the cows are not adversely affected by the
hole,'' Bo Pehrsson, the veterinarian leading the project, was
quoted as saying.
   He said farmers could save up to $158 per cow annually if
domestic feed replaces imported grains.

<HEAD>Group Urges Directing Biotechnology to Help Family Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new push of science into agriculture
through biotechnology is raising questions about the kind of farming
that may result, says Chuck Hassebrook of the Center for Rural
Affairs.
   So new is the practice of genetic engineering, cloning, embryo
transfer and other scientific feats that Hassebrook and others at
the center fear there hasn't been enough attention paid to the basic
research agenda involving biotechnology.
   A new report, ``Choices for the Heartland: Alternative Directions
in Biotechnology and Implications for Rural America,'' written by
Hassebrook and colleague Gabriel Hegyes has been issued by the
center, based in Walthill, Neb.
   ``The expense and sophistication of biotechnology will narrow the
range of individuals directly involved in breeding animals and
plants,'' the report said. ``Questions about who will be served by
this technology and who will set the research agenda are of
paramount importance when so few people control the tools and
language of the trade.''
   Private companies, the Agriculture Department, state and regional
experiment facilities, and the agricultural scientific community in
general are advancing rapidly into biotechnology frontier.
   Crops with built-in ``insecticides'' and livestock with genetic
capabilities to produce more meat and milk are some of the obvious
goals.
   ``Properly directed, agricultural research and biotechnology can
make agriculture more efficient by providing ways to replace capital
and purchased inputs (production items) with the labor and
management of more family farmers,'' the report said.
   For example, the center said a new development which could save a
farmer $5 per hog produced in return for an additional $2 worth of
time spent on management and labor would ``increase family farm
opportunities and make agriculture more efficient by decreasing
production costs.''
   Hassebrook outlined the report Thursday to House and Senate
agriculture committee staffers in hopes of gathering congressional
support for a closer scrutiny of biotechnology's rapidly developing
role in the structure of American agriculture.
   ``Agricultural research is almost a form of social planning, in
that the decisions you make about what research you're going to
pursue is going to have a lot to do with shaping agriculture,''
Hassebrook said in an interview.
   The essence of the center's report is that there are two
directions that can be followed by the biotechnology wave:
   One path leads to ``industrial production systems'' that continue
the trend toward larger and fewer farms, continuous production of
one or two high-value cash crops, and large-scale livestock
operations that require high investment and total confinement.
   The other route is to ``low-input, sustainable'' family farm
systems designed to preserve soil and water resources. Farmers using
these systems seek to improve farm profits by cutting back on
capital investments and reducing purchases of fertilizers,
pesticides and other production items.
   ``We could use biotechnology to make agriculture more sustainable
and to strengthen family farms, or we could use it to go in the
other direction,'' Hassebrook said. ``The problem is that very few
are asking these questions ... it's almost kind of leaving it to
chance.''
   The Center for Rural Affairs is a non-profit family farm research
and advocacy group that began in 1973. Hassebrook has been with it
since 1976.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 485,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Thursday the wheat was part of an
authorization on Jan. 25 of more than 2 million tons under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Sims said the wheat is for shipment for April. Counting some left
over from a previous EEP arrangement and the Jan. 25 authorization,
the Soviets have 525,200 tons still available under the program.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought almost 3.5
million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term
supply agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec.
31, 1990.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 485,000 tons are equal to about 17.8 million bushels
worth around $73 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of
grain sorghums.
   Sims said the 485,000 tons of wheat were sold by The Peavey Co.,
110,000 tons; Continental Grain Co., 100,000; Bunge Corp., 100,000;
Ferruzzi USA Inc., 150,000; and Mitsubishi International, 25,000.
   The companies will get subsidies of $22.46 per ton, or about 61
cents per bushel, under the EEP arrangement.

   Corn and sorghum growers who participated in
last year's feed grain program will get about $125 million from the
Agriculture Department this month.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said Thursday the payments will be in the
form of generic certificates, which are redeemable in surplus
commodities held by the CCC.
   About $85 million will be paid to eligible corn farmers and $40
million to sorghum producers.
   Most corn farmers, upon request, were paid about $2.6 billion at
the time they signed up in the 1988 program, and sorghum farmers
collected about $288 million in advance payments, Hertz said.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes EPA Handling of Grants for Community Groups</HEAD>

   The Environmental Protection Agency is making
it difficult for citizen groups near Superfund hazardous waste sites
to participate in a grant program, a congressional report says.
   The program, which provides up to $50,000 in grants for community
groups to hire technical experts, isn't working, Rep. Jim Florio,
D-N.J., said Thursday after releasing the report with Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass.
   While some community groups described EPA staff as helpful to
applicants, ``many more commented that they were actively
discouraged from applying or expressed the belief that the agency
could not be interested ... based on the cumbersome process it had
established,'' the report said.
   The report, based on a survey of 72 people and community groups,
concluded the Technical Assistance Grant program was plagued by a
long application process, difficult-to-understand forms and EPA
staff resistance.
   Walter Kovalick Jr., deputy director of EPA's Office of Emergency
and Remedial Response, said, ``Trying to empower citizen groups is a
very difficult task when trying to balance fiscal responsibility and
being as helpful as we can to community groups.''
   He said EPA is trying to improve the program, and emphasized it
was not agency policy to discourage participation.
   Grants are available at each of the 1,175 Superfund hazardous
waste sites, so that community groups can get the technical
information needed for a voice in cleanup operations.
   Kovalick said 13 grants have been awarded so far, and the EPA is
considering an additional 79 letters expressing interest.
   The survey found that under the program, created in 1986:
   _More than 90 percent of the community groups encountered ``major
problems'' with the application process, with 9 out of 10 applicants
reporting difficulty in completing paperwork. One out of four
applicants spent more than six weeks filling out the applications.
   _EPA required that communities pay 35 percent of the technical
assistance costs, although Congress recommended only a 20 percent
matching requirement.
   _The agency agreed to waive the cost-sharing requirement only in
exceptional circumstances, while Congress wanted waivers whenever
needed to foster public participation.
   The report blamed the cumbersome application process for
``discouraging affected groups from participating'' in the program,
and added that the 35 percent community share makes the program
``insurmountable'' for many community organizations.
   Kovalick said EPA was given discretion to choose the matching
contribution for communities, and felt that by setting the figure at
35 percent, there would be more federal money to spread around.

<TEXT>
   U.S. mortality rates for two of the three leading
causes of death _ heart disease and stroke _ are headed downward,
but cancer is on the increase as unhealthy habits of yesteryear
catch up with the older population.
   The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that the U.S. death
rate from heart disease in 1987 was 313 per 100,000 people, down
from 318 the year before. For stroke, or cerebrovascular disease,
the rate was 61 per 100,000, down from 62.
   But the mortality rate from cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer,
has been going up in recent years, the CDC said. There were 196
cancer deaths in 1987 for every 100,000 Americans, up from 195 the
year before.
   ``What we are seeing ... is the continuation of some long-term
trends,'' said Dr. Harry Rosenberg, a researcher with the National
Center for Health Statistics.
   Heart disease, cancer and stroke account for about two-thirds of
the 2 million deaths that occur in the United States every year, the
Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   Health professionals closely analyze the CDC's statistics on the
three leading causes of death for use in determining public health
programs.
   ``They're used to monitor the health of the nation,'' Rosenberg
said.
   He said the cancer rate has been rising as Americans who had
unhealthy lifestyles in their youth get older. But the rate should
fall in coming years because of changing lifestyles among the young.
   For example, among 45- to 54-year-olds the cancer rate dropped to
166 per 100,000 in 1986 from 181 per 100,000 in 1979, Rosenberg
said. He attributed preventative measures of the past two decades
such as improved diet and less smoking as contributing to the drop.
   The decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke has been a
decadelong trend, said Thomas Thom, an epidemiologist with the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
   Most experts believe that the decline can be attributed to
improvements in personal health, greater prevention of disease,
improvement in medical care for heart or stroke patients, or all of
those factors, Thom said.
   ``The decline is ... very real, and very consistent,'' he said.
   Thom cited trends toward quitting smoking, controlling high blood
pressure and lowering cholesterol levels, as well as ``increased
physical activity and, generally, health consciousness'' as factors
in the decrease. At the same time, cardiac intensive care units have
come into widespread use in hospitals, and heart surgery has become
commonplace.
   ``There are plenty of reasons to think all those reasons
contributed,'' he said.
   Heart disease killed 762,820 of the 2.2 million Americans who
died in 1987. Cancer killed 477,190, and stroke killed 149,220. A
year earlier, 2.1 million Americans died, including 765,490 from
heart disease, 469,376 from cancer and 149,643 from stroke,
Rosenberg said.
   Complete mortality figures from 1988 are not yet available,
Rosenberg said.
   The mortality rate from heart disease was showing a slight
increase from 1987 levels in the 12 months from October 1987 to
September 1988, he said. But that might be traced, in part, to an
influenza epidemic last winter which preyed upon those at increased
risk of problems from flu _ such as patients with chronic heart
disease, he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Almost Unchanged Against Yen, Stocks Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was almost unchanged Friday against
the Japanese yen in Tokyo, while stock prices declined slightly.
   The dollar opened at 128.58 yen, up 0.51 yen from Thursday's
closing, and ranged between 128.10 and 128.70 yen during the day. It
finished the week at 128.12 yen, up a slight 0.05 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 22.67 points Thursday, lost 73.63
points, or 0.22 percent, closng at 32,000.10.
   Dealers said the dollar was holding its strength against the yen
following a West German decision to keep interest rates unchanged.
   Bundesbank, the West German central bank, announced Thursday it
would maintain its official discount rate at 4.0 percent and its
Lombard interest rate at 6.0 percent.
   ``The dollar may move up to 129 yen in the near future,'' said a
dealer at a major Tokyo bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``But it would take a real effort on the part of the market to push
it up to 130 yen.''
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index shot up 226.34 points
within minutes of the market's opening, but began declining toward
the end of the morning session because of profit-taking, traders
said.

<HEAD>25 Feared Dead In Fire, Stampede At Industrial Parade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 25 people were feared killed in
a fire and stampede today when flames engulfed a tent during
celebrations honoring the founder of one of India's largest
industrial companies, news agencies reported.
   Press Trust of India said at least 25 men, women and children
died in the blaze in Jamshedpur, a steel town 140 miles west of
Calcutta. United News of India said at least 25 were feared dead and
50 suffered severe injuries.
   The news agencies said the fire broke out in a big tent jammed
with spectators watching a parade at the Tata Iron and Steel Co.
   Press Trust of India said about 30,000 people watching the parade
tried to flee as flames shot into the sky.
   United News of India said winds fanned the flames before fire
trucks arrived. The news agency said the cause of the fire was not
yet known, but police suspected an electrical short circuit.
   Neither agency said whether the fire was under control.
   The parade was part of festivities marking the 150th anniversary
of the birth of Sir Jamshedji Tata, for whom the city is named.
   The Tata plant, built in 1912, is one of India's largest
producers of steel.
   Sir Jamshedji launched an industrial empire that today
encompasses luxury hotels, textile mills and manufacturing plants
that turn out trucks and buses, watches, telephones, cosmetics and
several other products.
   Many of the buses and big trucks in India bear the Tata logo, and
the heavy vehicles also are exported to many Asian and Middle
Eastern countries.

<HEAD>Partisan Debate on Tower; Closed Session Possible</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Senate debate scheduled to begin 10:30 EST</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate debate over John Tower's troubled
nomination as defense secretary is producing its share of partisan
sparks after only one day, with one key senator holding out the
possibility of airing sensitive information in a closed-door session.
   ``I don't suggest it and I want to avoid it, (but) it may be
necessary to have a closed session,'' Armed Services Committee
Chairman Sam Nunn said Thursday in the midst of a flare-up over
material damaging to Tower that has been leaked from an FBI report.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said Tower had been ``trashed'' by
material that was leaked, and said those responsible never mentioned
exculpatory material that also appeared in the FBI report. ``A
closed session of the Senate would not repair the damage that's been
done,'' he said.
   Several senators called for releasing some of the FBI material in
sanitized form to give the public a better idea of what it contains.
But when Nunn, D-Ga., raised the possibility of making the
transcripts of closed committee sessions public, no Republican
followed up.
   Despite GOP expressions of outrage over the leaks, Tower's
chances of confirmation dimmed further as three additional Democrats
joined the opposition and the White House conceded that President
Bush has failed to persuade any Democrat to support the nomination.
   With a second day of debate set for today, an Associated Press
survey of senators showed 44 Democrats and Republican Larry Pressler
of South Dakota either solidly against the nomination or leaning
against, and 40 Republicans either solidly committed or leaning
toward confirmation. The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the
Senate.
   Republicans said they hoped to use the debate to marshal public
support and the White House insisted it would fight to the end.
   But one senior GOP senator, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he wouldn't rule out the possibility of a withdrawal before a
vote.
   Nunn led the Democratic opposition in opening Wednesday's debate.
He said he was concerned over the appearance created by Tower's
acceptance of consulting fees after his service as an arms
negotiator.
   Nunn cited the ``obvious tension between the information he
acquired as arms control negotiator and his obligations to his
consulting clients.''
   Nunn also came down hard on Tower's drinking practices. ``I
personally believe he had a serious drinking problem in the 1970s
and the 1980s, including recent years,'' he said.
   ``We're not talking about the secretary of interior, we're
talking about someone next to the president at the very top of the
nuclear chain of command,'' Nunn said. ``The example we set here is
going to work its way down.''
   Republicans rushed to Tower's defense, with Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., saying that not one of the 70 current senators who served
with Tower ever told the FBI of seeing him unable to carry out his
responsibilities.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said Tower was being assailed by
UFW's _ Unidentified Flying Witnesses _ and said, ``Most of us would
have to disqualify ourselves from passing judgment on issues that
come before us'' if held to the standard for conflict of interest
that Democrats are applying to Tower.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, provided one of the few light moments
of the day when he addressed the subject of alcohol.
   ``If my momma is watching I want to make it clear that the world
would be a better place if the Lord had never allowed whiskey to be
created,'' he said.
   But in a long defense of the man he replaced in the Senate, the
Texas Republican said great leaders such as Civil War Gen. U.S.
Grant and Britain's Winston Churchill were drinkers.
   Discussing the conflict-of-interest charge, Gramm said, ``our
conflict of interest is greater than'' Tower's and he cited defense
industry campaign money that lawmakers receive. ``How is our
appearance less indicting than his?'' he asked.
   ``By this logic, the ideal guy to be secretary of defense would
be a fellow who just came in on a turnip truck, who would agree not
to make any decisions related to turnips or trucks, and would agree
as soon as he left to retire to a monastery,'' Gramm said.
   The testiest exchange of the day occurred after Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, began quoting witnesses who used words such as ``crocked''
to describe Tower.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., interrupted and said Glenn had been
using material from the confidential FBI report. Glenn said the
words had already appeared in print but offered to have them removed
from the official record of debate. Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
had used such language already this week.
   The exchange set off the round of Republican complaints about
leaks, and led Nunn to say the White House had been guilty of the
same thing in reverse _ claiming that the report contained nothing
to disqualify Tower without disclosing the allegations.

   A Harvard astronomer turned sleuth helped crack an
international electronic spy ring in West Germany by tracking down
the ``hacker'' who broke into his computer files.
   For more than six months, finding the computer snoop was a lonely
obsession for 38-year-old Clifford Stoll, who initially was unable
to convince the FBI to investigate the computer break-in.
   On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests of
three hackers who allegedly acquired sensitive military computer
passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets. The Pentagon has
not determined the extent of the damage to U.S. security.
   A West German television network said the passwords and other
information came from key military and research computers in the
United States, Western Europe and Japan.
   ``I would say (Stoll) was largely responsible for cracking the
case,'' said Charles S. Hurley, former spokesman for the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., where Stoll once worked.
``Over a period of many months, he tracked them.''
   It all started with a 75-cent accounting error that Stoll noticed
in the California laboratory's shared-time computer system accounts
in August 1986.
   ``If it had been $1,000 off, I wouldn't have thought anything of
it,'' Stoll said in an interview Thursday. ``It's like, if your
house collapses, you just assume there's been an earthquake. But if
you find a tiny termite hole, you think, `Geez, I'd better
investigate.' It's the little problems that are the most
fascinating.''
   Stoll, a computer expert with a doctorate in astronomy from the
University of Arizona, searched for clues for three days and
discovered the error was caused by someone who had gained access to
the computer through telephone lines.
   ``For four months, I did absolutely nothing but watch what he
typed in,'' said the bushy-haired Stoll.
   Stoll said it became apparent that the hacker was trying to use
the Berkeley Laboratory's computer as a gateway to the so-called
Milnet, a computer network linking defense plants, university labs
and military installations.
   ``He was searching for key words like nuclear, ICBM, SDI,
biological warfare, Norad. He was reading everything he could get
his hands on, and then it turns out he was selling it to the
Soviets,'' Stoll said.
   He said he told the FBI about the hacker in the late summer of
1986, but there wasn't much of a response.
   ``They said, `What have you lost?' I said, `Well, all we've
actually lost is 75 cents.' So the FBI said, `Who cares, it's not
important.'''
   To be fair, Stoll added, ``They're much more sensitive to
computer break-ins now.''
   Charles Steinmetz, a spokesman for the FBI in Washington, said
the bureau would not comment on the case.
   Stoll said his girlfriend, tired of his electronic pager that
would beep whenever the hacker got onto the system, was responsible
for the big break in the case. She suggested that he lay a trap.
   He created bogus military data and a fictitious computer network
called ``SDI Net.'' The hacker took the bait, spending two hours
reading through the material, giving Stoll enough time to trace the
call to Hanover, West Germany.
   Three months later, Stoll said, he got a letter from a man in
Pittsburgh asking for information about SDI Net. When he turned that
letter over to the FBI in April 1987, he said, the bureau found the
man had connections to Eastern European governments and immediately
began an investigation.
   In all, Stoll said the spy ring had attempted to break into about
450 different computers and succeeded in stealing information from
more than 40 of them _ including data systems at the Pentagon,
defense contracting firms and U.S. military bases around the world.
   According to a German television network, authorities believe the
West German hackers were recruited by the Soviet KGB in 1985 and
``were paid with cash and drugs ... and were later forced to provide
the codes and passwords to the Soviets.''
   Stoll now has a contract from Doubleday Inc. to write a book
about his not-so-amateur sleuthing.
   But he said he is glad the case is nearing an end so he can get
back to work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in
Cambridge, Mass.
   ``In one sense, it was exciting,'' he said. ``In another sense,
it was dreadful, because I got zero astronomy done for two years.''

   The U.S. Naval Observatory says the view of the

awaken next Tuesday morning.
   Residents of Hawaii and about the western two-thirds of the
United States and Canada will be able to see the eclipse, which will
be at its maximum at about 10 a.m. PST, according to calculations
reported by the Observatory on Thursday.
   For residents of Alaska, about 70 percent of the sun will be
covered during the eclipse, while less of the sun will be blocked
for viewers in other areas, according to astronomers at McDonald
Observatory of the University of Texas at Austin.
   The eclipse will occur as the new moon passes between the sun and

   Instead of complaining about plans to shut down
86 U.S. military installations Congress should accept the package
and provide the necessary funds for the closings say the co-chairmen
of the commission that devised the plan.
   ``Once you start chipping away, this thing goes down the tubes,''
former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, D-Conn., on Thursday told the House
defense appropriations subcommittee.
   ``We collected a vast amount of data describing conditions at
thousands of installations we were asked to review,'' said former
Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala., in testimony before the corresponding
Senate subcommittee. ``We did not just pluck this list out of thin
air.''
   Critics of the commission's recommendations, particularly
lawmakers facing closings in their areas, have complained that the
findings are flawed.
   Congress can block the closings only if both the House and Senate
pass disapproval resolutions and lawmakers cannot pick and chose
among bases.
   A vote on the plan is schedule within weeks.

   The Justice Department says a Philadelphia man
facing deportation following claims that he killed Jews during World
War II already has left the United States.
   George Theodorovich, 66, withdrew his appeal of a deportation
order with immigration authorities after obtaining a visa to travel
to Paraguay, the department said Thursday.
   Theodorovich, a retired meat cutter, was ordered deported in 1987
by an immigration judge after Justice produced reports that he had
written to account for bullets he used to shoot Jews as a member of
the Ukrainian police during Nazi occupation in the city of Lvov.
   Theodorovich was ordered deported to Argentina but the case was
before the Board of Immigration Appeals when Theodorovich fled to
Paraguay on Dec. 18, 1988.
   The Justice Department was not notified that Theodorovich had
fled the country until this week when it received papers filed by
his attorney with the immigration appeals board.

<HEAD>Marriage Reported Between Two Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men, an army veteran and a farmer, were
recently married in a traditional ceremony in rural China, according
to an official report.
   The weekly Press Digest said in a report, available today, that
local authorities are trying to break up the ``marriage'' and that
the ex-soldier, who has acknowledged he is a homosexual, has been
fired from his job.
   It said Ye Xing, 26, a decorated four-year veteran of the
People's Liberation Army, married Li Linxing, 30, on Jan. 10.
   Nearly 100 friends and relatives were invited to the ceremony and
banquet in coastal Fujian province, it said.
   The report said Ye was twice honored as a model soldier and was
employed in the family planning office in his hometown in Zhouning
County after leaving the army three years ago.
   The township government and the department of public health are
now trying to separate the two and Ye was fired from his job, but
the pair is still living together with Li's family, it said.
   China's state-controlled media rarely reports on homosexuals.
There is virtually no open homosexuality in China, although there

Westernized cities such as Canton and Shanghai.
   Homosexuality is not a crime in China, but it is widely regarded
as immoral and socially unacceptable. Homosexuals are branded as
mentally disturbed.

   A tanker carrying 90,000 barrels of crude oil ran
aground in stormy seas off the Hawaiian island of Oahu, officials
said. Initial reports indicated as much as 8,400 gallons of oil had
spilled.
   Keith Spangler, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the 800-foot tanker
Exxon Houston sent a distress call at 8:20 p.m. Thursday.
   The 80,000-ton tanker reported it was ``hard aground''
three-tenths of a mile northwest of Barbers Point, an area on Oahu's
southwest coast about 15 miles west of the island's densely
populated area containing Honolulu, Spangler said.
   ``They said they've suffered some damage, but they don't know how
much yet,'' Spangler said.
   The Exxon Houston was offloading oil at about 5:25 p.m. at the
Hawaiian Independent Refinery when a mooring line broke, causing the
offloading hoses to break, said Andrea Simpson, a spokeswoman for
Pacific Resources Inc., the refinery's parent company.
   The refinery's valves automatically shut down the flow of oil, so
only about 8,400 gallons of the 90,000 barrels carried by the tanker
might have spilled, Simpson said.
   Simpson said the Coast Guard had reported that the high seas were
dissipating the oil spill.
   The Clean Island Council, a cooperative of oil handling companies
in Hawaii, planned to have crews out at first light to assess the
spill and begin any cleanup that might be needed, Simpson said.
   Spangler said environmental specialists from the Coast Guard's
Marine Safety Office were headed to the scene.

   Two men who tried to rob a man and woman instead
stole the couple's 5-month-old son when the scared parents fled
through a second-story window, police said. The robbers then tried
to trade the baby for ransom.
   The child, Mikhail Grant, was found uninjured when the suspects
were arrested at a subway station 16 hours later as they tried to
sell the baby back to the couple, police Inspector Richard Mayronne
said Thursday.
   ``The baby appears to be in excellent shape,'' he said. ``They're
obviously not professional kidnappers. I consider them very low on
the food chain, someone who would take a 5-month-old baby.''
   Mikhail's ordeal began early Thursday, when his father, Fynlass
Grant, 27, returned home from his job as a livery driver.
   Two men with automatic weapons pushed Grant into his Queens
apartment, demanding cash and jewelry, police said.
   When the men burst in, the baby's mother, Yvonne Grant, 26, who
is pregnant, jumped out the second-story window, police said. She
was treated for a broken ankle.
   Grant leaped out the same window, and one of the gunmen scooped
up the baby, said Mayronne.
   The Grants three other children, ages 6, 7, and 8, were left at
home unharmed.
   The abductors called the Grant's house three times, demanding
money and jewelry they believed was in a safe.
   A drop was negotiated, and Grant, accompanied by a plainclothes
police officer, exchanged the baby for a bag of ransom.
   Wayne Johnson, 21, and a 17-year-old man were arrested at the
station and will be charged with kidnapping, police said.

   About 150 jail inmates barricaded themselves in a
cellblock to protest what they believed was excessive force against
a prisoner. Seven people were injured, authorities said.
   The incident at the Rikers Island complex occurred Thursday
evening about an hour after the inmates tried to force their way
into a visiting room, said Correction Department spokeswoman Ruby
Ryles.
   ``The inmates believed there was a use-of-force incident
involving an officer and an inmate,'' Ryles said. ``They were
responding with some hostility as a result of that belief.''
   The inmates failed to get into the visiting room and barricaded
themselves in Cellblock 7, Ms. Ryles said.
   They were returned to their cells about an hour later.
   Four Correction Department officers and three inmates sustained
minor injuries.
   About 12,000 inmates are housed at Rikers Island.

<HEAD>Administration to Present Minimum Wage Hike Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials say Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole will outline a proposal to raise the
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour over three years and create an hourly
`'training wage'' of $3.35 at a Senate hearing today.
   The plan is to be presented before the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, whose chairman Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
has introduced legislation calling for a hike in the minimum wage to
$4.55 to be accompanied by automatic periodic increases in the
future.
   Mrs. Dole's testimony is expected to set the stage for a renewed
battle between the administration and congressional Democrats who
opposed the training wage last year as a sub-minimum wage that
organized labor says might threaten the jobs of higher paid workers.
   The minimum hourly wage has been set at $3.35 since 1981. A
minimum wage increase to $4.25 by 1991 would represent a 27 percent
increase over that rate.
   ``She will make the case that this is a proposal that fulfills
President Bush's campaign pledge to raise the minimum wage but
recognizes that any increase means a loss in job opportunities,''
said one administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``That's why the increase is more modest'' than the increase
proposed last year by Kennedy, D-Mass., said the official. ``And
that's why the training wage is there as well, to try to offset any
unemployment.''
   The official said the details of the administration position,
which would create a training wage to allow businesses to pay newly
hired employees $3.35 an hour for the first six months of employment
before facing a requirement to raise their pay to the full minimum,
were completed late Thursday afternoon.
   The plan also would expand an exemption from the $ 3.35 floor
that currently applys only to some small businesses in the retail
and service industries to all small businesses whose annual earnings
remain under a specified level.
   Bush has repeatedly linked a raise in the minimum wage to a
training wage, and Mrs. Dole said in her confirmation hearing that
she would support adding language to any legislation to prevent
employers from cutting their costs by hiring people at the training
wage and laying off higher paid workers.

<TEXT>
   The Indiana House overwhelmingly rejected a
bill that would have suspended jail terms of rapists and child
molesters who voluntarily underwent surgical castration.
   Lawmakers voted 91-8 Thursday against the bill, which was
sponsored by Rep. Richard Worden, an investigator with the Allen
County public defender office.
   He said he introduced the legislation because he believes as many
as 80 percent of rapists and child molesters who go to prison
eventually get out and commit the same crimes again.
   ``We've tried counseling and we've tried sentencing but that
doesn't work,'' said Worden. ``Castration does work.''
   But opponents of the measure said castration was uncivilized
punishment.
   ``I really question whether this solution would work,'' said Rep.
Richard Bray, a former prosecutor. ``The problem is mental, not
physical.''
   Rep. Frank Newkirk, a former deputy prosecutor, said he
sympathized with Worden's frustration over short jail terms for sex
offenders. But he said the bill was flawed because it would give a
sentencing judge no option but to release a convicted offender who
underwent castration.
   Rep. David Jones said the General Assembly should set standards
for civilized behavior and suggested the bill would send the
opposite message.
   Worden responded, ``Our citizens are civilized but we have some
animals out there who call themselves citizens.''

   Deafening noise, yellow dust and debris filled
the cabin when a huge hole ripped open in the side of a Boeing 747,
crewmembers said, and the pilot said he knew he was only going to
have one shot at landing the jet.
   ``I was praying for my life, for the lives of the passengers,
that we would get down safely,'' said Laura Brentlinger, chief
purser on United Airlines' Flight 811.
   Crewmembers on Thursday told of 25 terrifying minutes aboard the
jet when the forward cargo door and a 10-by-10 foot section of
fuselage ripped away during the Feb. 24 flight. Nine passengers were
sucked from the plane and presumed dead. Twenty-seven others were
injured.
   The pilot, Capt. David Cronin, told the Washington Post he relied
on his 38 years of training to bring the plane down.
   ``Part of the emergency descent procedure is to pull the power
back and put on the speed brake,'' he said in today's editions of
the newspaper. ``At 270 knots, you're supposed to drop the landing
gear.
   ``Because we were on two engines, if I had done that, we would
have lost too much altitude to make it back. So I held off on
extending the gear,'' he said.
   He said he had to constantly revise airspeed calculations because
the aircraft was overweight and the hole in its right side caused a
lot of drag.
   ``It was a difficult situation to keep the aircraft pointed in
the direction we wanted to go and make it do what I wanted it to
do,'' Cronin said.
   ``I don't think a 747 has ever flown on two engines at that
weight. My concern for being overweight was staying airborne,'' he
said.
   To lighten the load, 90,000 pounds of fuel were dumped.
   ``Things were going very rapidly then. We were very busy,''
Cronin said.
   ``The most difficult part was we didn't have just one
emergency,'' the pilot said. ``We had compounded emergencies.
Usually, if an airliner has an emergency, it's usually an engine
fire or a hydraulic problem.''
   Normal landing speed with all four engines would have been 132
knots. The crew estimated that 170 knots would be safe. Cronin said
he chose to touch down at 200 knots because he was afraid of losing
control of the jet if he slowed it further.
   ``We only had one shot at it,'' he said. ``There was no way
you're going to go around again. You're going to land.''
   Attendant Ricky Umehira said he heard a ``big boom,'' was knocked
to the floor and grabbed onto the bottom of the stairway at the back
of the first-class compartment.
   After getting his bearings, Umehira said he saw the hole in the
side of the plane about 12 feet away.
   ``I thought, `This couldn't be happening to me. No way, not to
me,'' he said.
   Attendant Ricky Lam was by himself ``in the pit,'' the cramped
cooking galley below the main passenger deck.
   The explosive decompression lifted Lam off his feet and he landed
on his back as he felt the plane ``go into a steep nosedive.''
   Lam climbed up an emergency chute to the main cabin and said he
had to crawl through ``all kinds of rubbish and debris'' and
couldn't see anything but yellow dust.
   ``I was thinking I was the only one left on the plane,'' he said.
``And then I stood up and saw the passengers.''

   Venezuela pumps about $1.5 billion a year into
Florida's economy, and business leaders are concerned that civil
unrest and economic woes in the South American nation could disrupt
their lucrative trade.
   Hundreds of people have been killed or injured in riots this week
in the wake of government-ordered price hikes in Venezuela. The
underlying economic problems are expected to make it harder for that
nation to import goods in the near future.
   Venezuela, which has had a relatively high standard of living in
the past decade because of an infusion of oil money, is Florida's
biggest export market for items like personal computers, software
and car and boat parts.
   ``About 40 percent of Florida's exports go to Venezuela,'' said
Jose Gimenez, president of the Venezuela Chamber of Commerce in
Miami. ``You can mention any item and it's probably there.''
   The rioting may not have an immediate impact on trade, but
Gimenez said he believes it signals an end to the glory days of
Venezuela's consumer economy.
   ``Venezuela has been living in a subsidized cocoon for 25 years.
Now it hurts to come out into the open,'' Gimenez said.
   Florida bankers were expecting a decline in trade with Venezuela
even before the unrest because of that country's falling foreign
currency reserves and its decision to impose a substantial 60
percent tariff on many imported goods.

   Leftist rebels assaulted a
military post on the capital's outskirts one day after the armed
forces said they were beginning a three-month cease-fire. At least
three soldiers and two civilians died in the shootout.
   Panicked residents of the working class San Ramon neighborhood
threw themselves on the ground behind walls, parked vehicles and
piles of bricks at a masonry supply business as soldiers advanced on
rebel attackers Thursday evening.
   ``Commie dogs! Show yourselves, cowards!'' some soldiers shouted
as they moved forward, running in a crouch and pausing every few
yards to survey the scene, aim and fire.
   The guerrillas attacked just before sunset, firing four anti-tank
rockets at the state-owned ANTEL telephone switching station in San
Ramon, on the northwestern edge of the city.
   The attack on the telephone facility, which caused no casualties
and only slight damage to a brick wall, appeared to be a diversion.
   Minutes later, about 10 blocks away, a gunbattle broke out at the
San Ramon Civil Defense post, where about 20 soldiers were stationed.
   Several dozen troops from the 1st Army Brigade on duty nearby
advanced toward the post, and the exchange escalated into a fierce
battle that lasted nearly an hour.
   Journalists saw at least three dead soldiers loaded onto a truck.
Two civilians, one an adolescent boy, also were killed. ``There are
lots of dead,'' one young soldier told a journalist.
   Several soldiers were wounded, but there was no official casualty
count early today and no indication of rebel casualties.
   The armed forces on Wednesday began what they said was a
three-month halt to offensive operations in an effort to foster
peace talks. The U.S.-backed government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte has called on the rebels to respond in kind.
   The rebels said Wednesday they were willing to declare a
cease-fire once a time, place and agenda for peace talks is agreed
upon.
   The guerrillas have said they will participate in this year's
presidential election and respect its the outcome if it is postponed
from March 19 until September, giving them time to prepare.
   Earlier Thursday, the rebels said the army was violating its own
cease-fire by moving into guerrilla-controlled territory.
   ``That demonstrates the falsehood of the supposed cease-fire,''
said the insurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   It did not mention fighting as a result of army troop movements,
which it said occurred in the northern zones of Morazan, San Miguel
and Chalatenango provinces.
   Those areas are dominated by the rebels, who are waging a
nine-year revolution against the government.
   A top army officer indicated the military would continue some
operations despite the cease-fire.
   ``A cease-fire does not mean the armed forces relinquishes its
constitutional duty of defending sovereignty and ensuring security,
tranquility and stability,'' Col. Mauricio Vargas, commander of the
eastern region, said in a televised interview Wednesday night.
   ``If people are up in arms in any part of the nation's territory,
we have the legal and moral obligation to fight them,'' he said.
   The guerrillas accuse the government of procrastinating in
response to their peace overture.
   The U.S. State Department says the rebels' refusal to declare a
cease-fire calls into question their stated desire for peace.

   A new study urges Harvard University to
look beyond traditional sources for black and women faculty, saying
the school has made little progress since its minority hiring was
criticized almost a decade ago.
   ``We believe that there would be symbolic importance to minority
and women students at Harvard and in the nation as a whole if there
were a more visible presence at Harvard of faculty who share their
social characteristics,'' said the report, which was issued Thursday.
   Harvard President Derek Bok declined comment on the report.
   In a separate study in New York, a committee of doctors and
medical educators recommended that every teaching hospital in the
state set a four-year goal of having blacks and Hispanics make up 11
percent of its first-year resident physicians.
   The New York State Council on Graduate Medical Education said 12
percent, or 360, of the 3,000 first-year residents in training in
New York last year were minority group members, about evenly divided
between blacks and Hispanics. However, the greatest concentration of
minorities was in a few New York City hospitals, it said.
   The Harvard review of affirmative action in the university's
Faculty of Arts and Sciences was requested by Dean Michael Spence.
The faculty of about 900 teachers is the liberal arts heart of the
prestigious school founded in 1636 to educate young men.
   The 10-member panel that wrote the report included three women,
two blacks, a Hispanic and an Asian.
   While noting that women face difficulty finding faculty openings
and advancing at Harvard, the panel said blacks, Hispanics and
Native Americans need the most help. The pool of candidates in those
groups is small and in some instances shrinking, they noted.
   The report advocates affirmative action, not with quotas or by
stretching standards, but by looking beyond traditional routes and
groups to find potential faculty.
   Currently, Harvard has numerical targets for women and minority
faculty and issues a yearly progress report, but it is not required
to meet those targets.
   The report was considered Wednesday by the arts and sciences
Faculty Council and is expected to go to Spence and the full faculty
for approval later this spring.
   Real change will rely on new attitudes rather than administrative
orders, said Jeffrey Wolcowitz, assistant dean for undergraduate
education and spokesman for the faculty committee.
   ``If Harvard as the premier institution that trains the best and
the brightest is a place that is absent of the best black men and
women, it sends a message that we are not very good. And many of us
are,'' said Dean Lawrence Watson, co-chairman of the Association of
Black Faculty and Administrators.
   In 1980, a report prepared at the request of the school's Black
Students Association concluded that Harvard's recruitment efforts
had been passive.
   According to the new report, in 1978-79 just 12 women were full
professors, or 3.4 percent of the total. Today they number 30 or 7.8
percent. There were 44 women on the faculty headed for tenure in
1978-79 or 19.8 percent compared with 64 and 27.7 percent now.
   In 1978-79 the numbers of minority full professors totaled 21, or
5.9 percent, with tenure-track teachers numbering 17, or 7.7
percent. This year there are 27 full professors, or 7 percent, and
28 minorities on the way up, or 12.1 percent.
   To improve hiring, the new report proposes naming a special
associate dean for affirmative action in Arts and Sciences; that
each faculty department designate a faculty member for that effort;
and that a standing faculty committee on affirmative action be
established.

   Israeli troops demolished or sealed 10 homes in
the occupied lands to punish Palestinians suspected of attacking
Arab collaborators or Israeli targets, the army said today.
   In the West Bank, the army blew up seven houses and sealed an
eighth late Thursday and early today. The homes belonged to
Palestinians suspected of killing an Arab collaborator and throwing
firebombs at Israeli cars and homes, the army said.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army sealed rooms in two houses belonging
to Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at an Israeli
government office and setting on fire a bus carrying workers to
Israel.
   Since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987,
the army has destroyed or sealed more than 200 houses, usually
before suspects were convicted of any wrongdoing.
   The United States condemns the practice, saying it violates the
right to due process of law.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, said a battle Thursday
in south Lebanon between Israeli troops and four Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrillas showed the organization is
``making fun of its promise to stop terrorism.''
   Officials said the four guerrillas, who were killed, had been
trying to infiltrate Israel on a hostage-taking mission.
   ``Despite the explicit PLO promise to the United States that it
would stop terror actions against Israel, the infiltration attempt
is a decisive proof that this terrorist organization is carrying out
terror acts,'' Shamir told the daily Yediot Ahronot.
   The United States opened direct contacts with the PLO in December
after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said he was renouncing terrorism
and recognizing Israel.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said today that the latest
infiltration attempt violated the U.S conditions.
   Asked whether Israel was trying to persuade Washington to end the
contacts, Liel said: ``We are forwarding the information regarding
these attacks on a regular basis to the United States, but they
should draw their own conclusions.''

   County officials are asking a judge to bar a
weekend rock concert for white supremacists and skinheads billed as
an ``Aryan Woodstock.''
   While Napa County officials had a court date today, the leader of
a militant Jewish group said he would lead hundreds of protesters in
a demonstration at the concert site at a ranch about 35 miles north
of San Francisco.
   ``We're going to rally with our people. (We want) such a large
number of people that the skinheads will show their colors and
scamper away like cockroaches,'' Irv Rubin, national chairman of the
Jewish Defense League, said Thursday.
   He vowed to ``take whatever consequences, including arrest,
including hospitalization and, if I have to, I'll give my life in
this battle.''
   County officials hope to block the event on the grounds that no
permit was issued and that the concert would pose a public nuisance.
   At a hearing in Napa County Superior Court Thursday, District
Attorney Jerry Mautner said the county couldn't issue a permit for
an event restricted according to race.
   Judge W. Scott Snowden scheduled another hearing for today to
give concert organizers time to respond to the county.
   Tom Metzger, leader of a group called the White Aryan Resistance,
said the concert was being organized on private land and on an
invitation-only basis. He said about 2,000 people had been invited
to listen to such bands as the Boot Boys and Hammerhead in what has
been billed as an ``Aryan Woodstock.''
   ``We're going to have some speeches, we're going to have some
music, and we're going to go home,'' Metzger told the board of
supervisors on Tuesday.
   If the court blocks the concert, Metzger said his group ``takes

   Rubin appealed to residents of Northern California to demonstrate

<HEAD>After Town Board Cancels Hearing, Quaker Group Holds Alternative
Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last-minute cancellation of a town
Health Board hearing on military-funded anthrax research at the
University of Massachusetts didn't deter a Quaker group from
expressing its opposition.
   ``We feel the issue is of extreme importance and we will not back
down just because of a decision they have made in the last 24
hours,'' said John Bonifaz, who is organizing efforts by the local
branch of the American Friends Service Committee to stop the
research.
   The Quakers claim the 23-year-old research project poses a health
threat to the nation as well as Amherst because its findings could
be used for military purposes. The group went ahead with its own
meeting Thursday after the Health Board hearing it had requested was
canceled.
   Anthrax is an infectious disease contracted by wild and
domesticated animals, especially cattle and sheep. It is caused by a
bacterium and can be transmitted to people.
   The chief scientist on the research project, Curtis B. Thorne,
has maintained his work on the basic structure of the bacterium is
aimed at finding a vaccine for the disease.
   Town Manager Barry DelCastilho said he canceled the hearing after
a town attorney warned him that two of the board's four members work
at the university, posing a conflict of interest. He said he hoped
to appoint a fifth member to the board soon to make a quorum for a
hearing.
   At the meeting, Bonifaz's group presented a draft regulation that
would ban military biological research. Others spoke to urge the
board to stop the research, which is funded by the Department of
Defense.
   ``Research conducted under contract with the Department of
Defense has military and not public health objectives. It is the
military contract for this research that is of concern to us,'' said
Nachama Wilker, director of the Council for Responsible Genetics in
Boston.
   University officials didn't attend the meeting. Chancellor Joseph
Duffey has argued that the strain of bacteria being tested is
non-virulent and has been under study for 23 years without incident.
He also said the school's policy is to allow Defense Department
research as long as it is unclassified.

<HEAD>Navajo Court Dismisses MacDonald Lawsuit Challenging Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navajo high court dismissed an
attempt by embattled tribal chairman Peter MacDonald to overturn his
suspension over kickback allegations.
   Thursday's decision by the tribal Supreme Court apparently clears
the way for the Navajo Tribal Council to appoint an interim
replacement for MacDonald.
   MacDonald has been under fire since witnesses, including his son,
told a U.S. Senate select committee that he had taken kickbacks and
bribes from companies wanting to do business with the tribe.
   MacDonald has denied any wrongdoing.
   In a lawsuit, MacDonald sought to have the Council's decision to
place him on leave declared illegal.
   He first brought the lawsuit to Kayenta tribal district Judge
Harry Brown, his brother-in-law, who issued a temporary restraining
order to stop the suspension.
   But the tribal Supreme Court said that MacDonald filed the suit
in the wrong court, that the brother-in-law judge should have
disqualified himself, and that the council cannot be sued for its
actions as a legislative body.
   The court's decision did not specifically address the council's
Feb. 17 decision to place MacDonald on administrative leave.
   Lawyers for the council majority opposing MacDonald declined to
comment on the ruling. MacDonald's office said he might issue a
statement later.
   On Wednesday, the council authorized the tribal Department of
Justice to file a civil fraud lawsuit against MacDonald over the
tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch.
   The council's resolution said the suit should try to recover
``any and all tribal funds wrongfully obtained by the sellers.''
   Witnesses before the U.S. Senate panel testified that MacDonald
shared a Phoenix oilman's $7.2 million profit from quick purchase
and resale of the ranch to the tribe.
   The Navajos are the nation's largest Indian tribe. Approximately
150,000 of the tribe's 200,000 members live on the reservation,
which includes much of northeastern Arizona as well as parts of
northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah.

   While other members of the Indiana House were
proposing new laws, Rep. John Gregg was proposing marriage.
   Gregg, a second-term Democrat from Sandborn, asked his
girlfriend, Sherry Biddinger, to be his wife Thursday afternoon
while the two stood at the back of the House chamber during a
legislative debate.
   Biddinger, an Indianapolis attorney, accepted the offer. A
November wedding is tentatively planned.
   ``Where would be a better place (to propose) for two people
interested in politics than on the floor of the House?'' said Gregg.
   After the proposal, Gregg went to the House microphone and
announced the engagement to cheers and applause from his colleagues.
   Gregg said he and Biddinger have dated for five years since
meeting at the Indiana University Law School.
   ``If she could go to all those chicken dinners with me and march
in parades and meet all those people, I thought she could put up
with me,'' said Gregg.

<TEXT>
   A group of Italian opponents of capital
punishment tried to boost the spirits of a 19-year-old woman who is
sitting on death row while the Indiana Supreme Court decides her
fate.
   ``We tried to ease her tension because it's not easy to wait for
a piece of paper that's telling you that you have to die or not,''
said Rev. Vito Bracone after a three-hour visit with Paula Cooper at
the Indiana Women's Prison.
   ``We tried to assure her that we'll be always with her.''
   Bracone is a member of the Italian group ``Thou Shall Not Kill''
that has been protesting Cooper's sentence for two years in Italy,
where the case has received much attention.
   The group planned to travel to New York to deliver petitions to
the United Nations today before returning to Italy.
   Cooper is the youngest female in the United States sentenced to
death. She was 15 in 1985 when she and three other Gary teen-agers
robbed and killed Ruth Elizabeth Pelke, a 78-year-old retired Bible
teacher. Pelke was stabbed at least 30 times with a butcher knife.
   The state high court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in her
appeal and has not indicated when it will issue a decision.
   At the time of Cooper's sentencing, Indiana law allowed the death
penalty for anyone over the age of 10 convicted of murder. The age
limit has since been raised to 16, but was not made retroactive.
   Cooper's lawyer, William L. Touchette, described his client as
``relaxed and happy'' after meeting the Italians.
   ``There's a lot of anticipation sitting there waiting. It's not
the easiest thing in the world to do,'' Touchette said. ``But it's
like finally it's starting to come to a conclusion _ maybe _ for
her.''
   Touchette said he's optimistic that the Supreme Court will
commute his client's death sentence. ``I'm hopeful, always
hopeful,'' he said.
   In a handwritten note to The Associated Press, Cooper refused to
grant interviews with the U.S. media.
   ``She doesn't want any negative publicity,'' said Patti Wolter,
an investigator who has worked on the case with Touchette. ``She's
afraid of doing or saying something that's going to influence public
opinion.''

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with identity of dog breeds in 4th graf, `Tait said...'
Note contents.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old Michigan child was killed by neighborhood dogs in a
mauling so grisly a doctor likened it to a shark attack, and a
Florida infant had four fingers chewed off by the family pet.
   The body of the Ishpeming, Mich., child was discovered by
neighbors outside the family's home.
   ``It appears she had been chewed upon, right down to the bone,''
said Sgt. Greg Tait of the Michigan State Police. ``Based on what
the doctor saw, he says it resembles a shark attack.''
   Tait said residents pointed out two of three neighborhood dogs
suspected in the attack, and officers killed the animals, identified
as a huskie and a German shepherd. Police were searching for the
third dog Thursday afternoon, he said.
   The child's name was withheld until her parents were notified,
Tait said.
   ``People let their dogs run loose during the day and there have
been as many as 25 in a pack,'' said Annie Trudell, whose store is
across the street from where the attack took place. ``People don't
understand how quickly a family pet can become vicious.''
   In Ocala, Fla., a mixed-breed puppy gnawed four fingers off a
22-day-old girl's right hand.
   The 7-week-old dog was described as three-quarters pit bull and
one-quarter husky.
   Shaye Lynne Emminger was in fair condition at Munroe Regional
Medical Center following the attack Wednesday morning. Her four
fingers were recovered from the puppy's stomach, but doctors could
not reattach them, said Jennifer Fanzlaw of the Marion County
Sheriff's Department.
   The child's parents, Michael Douglas Emminger, 19, and Deborah
Lawson Emminger, 16, awoke to find their child bleeding profusely in
her crib, Fanzlaw said. She said the dog also was in the crib.
   The dog was taken to the pound and killed.
   Investigators said they don't know what prompted the puppy to
bite the child, but they don't believe the dog attacked her
viciously, adding that the child might have had milk or formula on
her fingers.
   ``All puppies chew,'' Fanzlaw said.

<HEAD>Warning: Rio Beaches Could Be Hazardous To Your Health</HEAD>

   Think twice before setting foot on
the beaches of Rio de Janeiro.
   Thousands of hungry little parasites are waiting hidden in the
sand.
   A city study of Rio's beaches that was released earlier this week
says those chic beaches pictured on postcards and in international
travel magazines are hardly pristine. In fact, the report warns,
they're downright contaminated.
   ``The sand is the dirtiest it's ever been on record,'' said
Carlos Mora, spokesman for Rio's sanitation department, which
conducted the study.
   The study, conducted last month and released Tuesday, found the
sand of the toniest of Rio's beaches _ Copacabana, Leme, Ipanema and
Leblon _ is packed with nine types of parasites carried in animal
and human feces. Among them is the potentially fatal esquistossomose
parasite, which afflicts 8 million Brazilians.
   ``We don't want to create a panic,'' Mayor Marcello Alencar said
when he announced the study's findings. ``But the public ought to
know what is happening in its city.''
   Rio's beaches, polluted in the past by chemical waste from
factories and by occasional breaks in sewage lines along the
beachfront, have new enemies now. They are stray animals and
homeless beggars who bed down on the beaches, as well as hordes of
street vendors in make-shift shacks along the shore.
   A week ago, in an effort to clean up the beaches, police
officials raided Copacabana and hauled off hundreds of dollars worth
of merchandise from the illegal stands parked on the beach and along
the boardwalk.
   But the peddlers and the animals returned the next day _ with a
vengeance. And the beaches took another drubbing.
   ``You wouldn't catch me taking my kids to these beaches,'' said
Mora. ``The city has forgotten that it has to protect to beaches,
not just rave about how pretty they are.''
   He said that compared with a year ago, when the beaches were last
tested for pollution, the beaches ``had gotten a lot worse.''
   Despite the findings, some health experts were skeptical of the
potential health threat to sunseekers.
   ``The sun kills the parasites on the surface,'' said Dr. Carlos
Albeto de Freitas, a disease control expert for the city. ``The
danger lies in the deeper sand.''
   Still, the possibility of catching a disease from the sand is
greater than in past years.
   ``People just ought to be careful they don't dig their feet too
far under the sand,'' de Freitas said. ``Otherwise, they might go
home with more than a nice tan.''

<HEAD>Vrdolyak Unofficial Winner In Chicago GOP Mayoral Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In eight days, political maverick Edward Vrdolyak
has come out of hiding, unofficially won the Republican mayoral
primary and posed a potential threat to Richard M. Daley's bid to
get his father's old job.
   Vrdolyak, a write-in candidate, has not been declared the
official victor of Tuesday's Republican primary, but Thursday's
canvass by the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners found him
ahead, 11,621 to 10,478 over Herbert Sohn.
   ``If people can spell the name Vrdolyak, or close to it, and
write it in, I mean, it was just wonderful,'' said the joyous
ex-Democrat, a former alderman whose combative style is guaranteed
to add spice to the campaign that leads to the April 4 general
election.
   His apparent victory sets up a three-way battle for mayor:
Vrdolyak, Democratic nominee Richard M. Daley _ both white _ and
Timothy Evans, a black alderman running as an independent.
   The scenario is similar to the 1983 Democratic primary, in which
Daley and incumbent Jane Byrne split the white vote, allowing Harold
Washington to score a narrow victory on the way to eventually
becoming the city's first black mayor.
   The winner of the April 4 election fills the final two years of
the four-year term won by Washington, who died seven months after
winning the April 1987 election.
   Paul Kleppner, a Northern Illinois University professor who has
analyzed Chicago voting trends for the U.S. Justice Department,
downplayed the significance of Vrdolyak's candidacy and predicted a
Daley triumph.
   ``Vrdolyak will only draw white votes away (from Daley) if people
are sure they're not endangering the chance of a white candidate
winning,'' Kleppner said.
   Still, said analyst Tom Roesser, active in local GOP circles,
Vrdolyak's vote-drawing power far outstrips Sohn's.
   ``Eddie can't win, but he could cause some real mischief,''
Roesser said.
   Daley, son of 21-year Mayor Richard J. Daley, is vacationing in
Florida, but his chief campaign strategist, David Axelrod, said
Vrdolyak's influence on the election ``will be negligible.''
   Four of the city's 2,911 precincts remained to be counted and
after another review, the winner of the GOP primary will be
officially declared on Tuesday.
   Sohn, who was endorsed by the local Republican Party, held out
hope he could still be declared the GOP nominee and his aides
suggested the courts may make the final decision.
   Vrdolyak, the former chairman of the Cook County Democratic
Party, has lost his last two tries for office. He ran as an
independent for mayor in 1987, then became a Republican and sought
the office of clerk of the county court system last November.
   After the November defeat, he was rarely seen in public and gave
few interviews to the news media. But on Feb. 22, less than a week
before the Republican primary, he appeared at a rally and said he
would run as a write-in candidate for mayor at the urging of his
admirers.

<HEAD>Bomb Damages Hall In Mining Town Targeted By Black Boycott</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb blast early today
shattered windows at a civic center in a mining town where blacks
have launched a consumer boycott to protest the resegregation of
public facilities.
   Police said a limpet mine placed outside Carletonville's civic
center banquet hall exploded shortly after midnight, causing slight
damage and no injuries.
   Less than two hours later, a second bomb slightly damaged a power
pylon in Carletonville, police said.
   No arrests were reported, and there were no claims of
responsibility.
   White storeowners in Carletonville have reported a sharp drop in
black patronage since the boycott began Monday in the town 45 miles
southwest of Johannesburg. The local chamber of commerce reportedly
has drafted a memorandum urging the town council to abandon the
resegregation campaign.
   Councils in Carletonville and dozens of other Transvaal Province
towns were taken over by the extreme-right Conservative Party in
local elections last October. Carletonville and several other
councils have restored ``whites only'' status to parks and other
areas opened to all races in recent years.
   The governing National Party has indicated it is re-evaluating
the Separate Amenities Act, which allows the segregation of
municipal facilities, but there has been no move to repeal it
despite the government's criticism of the Conservative Party actions.
   On Wednesday, police reported two black men had been arrested for
allegedly intimidating blacks who planned to ignore the boycott.

<HEAD>Battle of Bunker Hill Cannon Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the four cannons that were all the 13
colonies had when the Revolutionary War started has been found in
the basement of a police station, ending a search that began nearly
20 years ago.
   ``It is a priceless piece of history which could be called a
national treasure,'' Capt. Albert Swanson, Metrolopitan District
Commission historian, said after cannon was found Thursday.
   The 3{-foot-long, 500-pound brass cannon, believed to have been
forged in London around 1760, was found behind dozens of bicycles in
a storage room that was being cleaned at the Metropolitan Police's
Lower Basin station.
   Swanson said it was used in the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17,
1775. Two of the four cannons the colonies had at the start of the
Revolutionary War were captured by the British.
   But the rediscovered cannon, now called the Hancock, and the
other, now called the Adams, were hidden in a swamp in Dedham,
Swanson said.
   The Hancock and the Adams were placed at the Bunker Hill Monument
during the 19th century. The Metropolitan District Commission was in
charge of the monument from 1919 until the National Park Service
took it over in 1975.
   ``When we took the site over in `75, there was one cannon tube
(the Adams) left at the top,'' said Peter Steele, curator of the
monument.
   ``They were a pair. We contacted the MDC about the missing one,
but no one was able to put their fingers on it. I had pretty much
given up hope. This is great news.''
   Swanson said he knew the cannon had been brought to the police
station but no one could tell him where it was, and he had been
keeping an eye out for it for 18 years. He and Steele thought it had
been taken from the monument in 1970 or 1972.
   ``What apparently happened is that a bracket holding the cannon
broke,'' Swanson said. ``It was brought to the station for
safekeeping.''
   Swanson said he hopes the cannon will be refurbished and placed
in new brackets at the monument by June 17, Bunker Hill Day.

<HEAD>U.S., South Korea Announce Exercises Despite Protests From North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and South Korea today
announced plans for large-scale joint military exercises despite
warnings from communist North Korea that the maneuvers could wreck
prospects for peace talks.
   The U.S. Eighth Army said about 200,000 U.S. and South Korean
troops, along with air force and navy units, would participate in
the annual ``Team Spirit'' exercises beginning March 14. About
70,000 U.S. troops are to take part.
   North Korea warned Thursday during talks with South Korean
delegates that ``Team Spirit'' must be abandoned if the two sides
are to make progress on easing tension across the divided peninsula.
North Korean officials charged ``Team Spirit'' was preparation for a
nuclear attack on the North.
   North Korea has been demanding a halt to ``Team Spirit'' for
several months and today's announcement in Seoul could be used by
the North to end all talks with the capitalist South. There was no
immediate reaction from the North today.
   South Korean officials said they hoped North Korea would continue
talks on improving relations, but that the exercises are vital to
the South's defenses. The North maintains far larger military forces
than the South and seriously threatens South Korea's safety, they
said.
   North Korea keeps armed forces estimated at 840,000 troops; South
Korea has about 600,000 of its own forces in addition to U.S. forces.
   North Korea and China will be invited to send observers to the
exercises to show there was no hostile intention, U.S. officials
said. The North has rejected similar offers in the past.
   North Korea pulled out of peace talks with South Korea in 1986
after Seoul refused to end ``Team Spirit'' that year. U.S. officials
said the North might do the same thing this year.
   North Korean and South Korean delegates failed to make progress
Thursday on setting terms for talks between their prime ministers
after the North said ``Team Spirit'' must be called off before the
opening of substantive negotiations. The two sides agreed to meet
again April 12.
   U.S. and South Korean officials said ``Team Spirit'' was being
held for the 14th consecutive year as a purely defensive exercise
that poses no threat to the North.
   ``The purpose is to train American and South Korean forces to
defend Korea. It's never threatened North Korea in the past, and
there is no threat this time,'' said a U.S. military spokesman on
condition of anonymity.
   The exercises will be on the same scale as in 1988, the U.S.
spokesman said.
   The soldiers will practice reinforcing South Korean units with
U.S. troops in the event of a North Korean attack. The United States
has about 42,000 troops based in the South under a mutual defense
treaty, and about 30,000 others will come from the United States to
take part in the maneuvers.
   The exercise will involve U.S. ground forces, including units
based on the American West Coast, along with major U.S. Navy and
U.S. Air Force units.
   U.S. military officials stressed today that the exercises would
be held far away from the North Korean border to avoid any risk of
an accidental confrontation. The main exercises will be held March
14-23.
   The two Koreas are archrivals with hundreds of thousands of
troops facing each other along their 150-mile border. The North
invaded the South in 1950, launching the Korean War. They are
technically still at war because no peace treaty was signed.

<HEAD>`Lend Me A Tenor,' A New Farce, Opens On Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs of other reviews; no PMs planned.</HEAD>

   Farce is built on desperation, and things don't
get more desperate than the doings at the Cleveland Grand Opera
Company, circa 1934.
   Its gala benefit performance of ``Otello'' is threatened by the
apparent demise of famed Italian tenor _ and unrepentant ladies' man
_ Tito Merelli. The company, along with 50 pounds of shrimp
mayonnaise, may expire unless someone can be found quickly to
replace the man known to his adoring fans as ``Il Stupendo.''
   That is the basic setup for ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' a new farce by
Ken Ludwig that barreled into Broadway's Royale Theater on Thursday
night. Although the play is slight, the evening is still delirium
triumphant, primarily because of the crackerjack direction of Jerry
Zaks and a superb cast led by Victor Garber and Philip Bosco.
   You'll know ``Lend Me a Tenor'' is a farce the minute the curtain
rises on six smashing art deco doors scattered throughout designer
Tony Walton's all-white hotel suite. They are waiting to be slammed.
And Zaks sees that they are _ in high, often hilarious, style.
   Tito, of course, is not dead. He's sleeping off a combination of
red wine and phenobarbital. But neither the opera company manager
(Bosco) nor his milquetoast assistant Max (Garber) knows that.
   Max, a frustrated opera performer, rises to Tito's high C.
Slapping on blackface, a shaggy wig and the singer's purple tights,
he goes on for the star, and no one knows the difference. When Tito
wakes up, he dons an identical costume _ didn't you know he would
carry a spare _ and suddenly there are two tenors and glorious
confusion.
   Much of the fun is physical rather than verbal _ Garber mixing a
drink with his finger, Bosco attacking a bowl of wax fruit or Garber
desperately trying to wake up the horizontal tenor. Zaks'
inventiveness is astonishing. He has to work hard with Ludwig's
script. Some of the jokes are obvious, unsurprising laughs, but Zaks
does his best to divert attention from these dips in dialogue.
   Still, there are some very funny situations, particularly in the
second act. The opera disguise allows Max to change his personality.
He becomes forceful and is able to conquer the opera manager's
daughter. She's looking for a fling but only wants to be flung by
Tito. Garber is all bumbling sweetness, a Walter Mitty who discovers
his voice and confidence at the same time.
   If Garber is all mumbles, Bosco is all roar. The actor raises
apoplexy to high art, particularly in one scene when he throws
himself in a rage at Tito's inert body. Seldom has such fury been so
funny.
   Ron Holgate can't quite hold onto his Italian accent, but
everything else is just about right in his performance as the
over-inflated Tito. He's even a fine singer. And he's perfectly
matched with Tovah Feldshuh as his jealous wife who one minute is a
purring pussycat, the next a snarling panther.
   J. Smith-Cameron is fetching as the ingenue, a stereotypical role
that usually is more simpering than sexy. Jane Connell charges
merrily through the play as the chairman of the opera guild and
there is other good support by Caroline Lagerfelt as an amorous
soprano and Jeff Brooks as an operatic bellhop.
   The glamorous costumes by William Ivey Long epitomize the 1930s.
Some of them are even funny, particularly an evening gown for Miss
Connell that makes her, in the words of another character, ``look
like the Chrysler Building.''
   ``Lend Me a Tenor'' isn't Feydeau _ not much is these days,
particularly on Broadway. But it is great fun, particularly because
of Zaks orchestrating all those slamming doors.
   In other reviews:
   ``Sheer craziness'' is how Clive Barnes of the New York Post
described the play. ``If you are feeling under the weather _ or even
over the weather, for that matter _ and you believe laughter is the
best medicine, let me prescribe for you this lovely dose of pure,
operatic idiocy.''
   Howard Kissel in the Daily News called the play enjoyable ``under
Jerry Zaks brilliant direction,'' although he noted that ``the plot
would not withstand intense scrutiny.''
   But in The New York Times, Frank Rich said the play was ``all
things farcical except hilarious.... The lines are almost never
witty, settling instead for double entendres ... (and) worse, too
many of the farcical situations seem like pale echoes of those in
similar works from the play's period.''

<TEXT>
   West German computer hackers have
stolen data that provides access to key military and research
computers in the West and passed that information to the Soviets,
officials and news reports said.
   A West German television network on Thursday said passwords,
codes and other information came from computers in the United
States, Western Europe and Japan. West Germany prosecutors said
three people were arrested, and a TV network said at least 10
computer hackers were involved in the spy ring.
   The Norddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network said among the
computers was the U.S. Defense Department's general databank, known
as Optimus; a NASA and a ``Star Wars'' research computer; and
computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.
   The network said attempts were made to gain access to the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, which
it called a key link in efforts to break into other U.S. computers.
   Clifford Stoll, an astrophysicist who did research at the
laboratory, said up to 50 military computers were broken into
through an astronomy computer, but that the hacker did not have
passwords for classified information.
   ``We were amazed! Here's some guy breaking into an astronomy
computer in Berkeley, reaching out into military computers trying to
search for information about SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative,
known as ``Star Wars''), about nuclear warheads,'' Stoll said in a
telephone interview Thursday from his home in Cambridge, Mass.
   Stoll, who works at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at
Harvard University, said he and other researchers helped break the
spy ring by providing false information. He said someone linked to
East bloc groups wrote the laboratory asking for related
information, leading authorities to crack the ring. He did not
elaborate.
   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office
in Karlsruhe, said police in Hanover arrested two computer hackers
on ``suspicion of espionage activities for an eastern European
intelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin,
he said.
   ``They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems''
and selling information to communist agents, Prechtel said.
   He said investigators are trying to assess how much damage was
caused to Western security interests.
   Roland Bachmeier, spokesman for the federal Interior Ministry,
said information was provided to Soviet intelligence agents.
   The officials declined to elaborate.
   In Hamburg today, West Germany's best-known club for computer
hackers said that in autumn 1987, it warned federal officials about
the vulnerability of international computer systems. However, Chaos
Computer Club president Wau Holland said federal officials ``did not
take the opportunity for a talk.''
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said that at the bidding of Soviet agents,
the computer hackers gained access to a U.S. Defense Department
computer and important research and business computers elsewhere.
   The hackers obtained sensitive information that would allow the
Soviets themselves to gain access to the computers and develop
technology based on the information, the network said.
   The information would also give the Kremlin access to U.S.
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to
several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace
research, the network said.
   ``Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs were
delivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. ``They opened the door
for the KGB to gain access to some of the most important computer
centers of the Western world.''
   William Bardeen, head of the theory group at Fermilab in Batavia,
said Soviets participate in research there. ``So there are Soviet
scientists living at Fermilab and using the computers. There isn't
anything confidential or strategic in the computers.''
   Jeff Schwartz, spokesman for Los Alamos National Laboratory, said
he knew of no evidence that a foreign intelligence agency had gained
access to its classified computer system.
   Norddeutsche Runkfunk said the three suspects were detained
following searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin and
Hanover.
   ZDF television said the three suspects ``belonged to a hardcore
of 10 hackers.''
   According to Norddeutsche Rundfunk, authorities believe the three
West German hackers were recruited by the KGB, the Soviet
intelligence agency, in 1985 and ``were paid with cash and drugs ...
and were later forced to provide the codes and passwords to the
Soviets.''
   The network said the trio handed over information from the United
States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany
at a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East Berlin.
   In Tokyo, a laboratory official said today that unknown West
German hackers broke into a computer system in a Japanese government
research laboratory in 1985.
   The National Laboratory For High Energy Physics discovered that a
research project was penetrated in mid-1985, laboratory spokesman
Shinichi Watanabe said. He said no sensitive information was stolen,
and the laboratory has since heightened security by changing
passwords and other measures.
   He said it was not known if the intruders were part of the
alleged spy ring in West Germany.

<HEAD>First AIDS Cases Reported In Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran recorded its first five cases of AIDS last
year, the World Health Organization said today in its latest health
update.
   The Islamic republic's report was among 2,008 new cases reported
to WHO last month, bringing the total to 141,894 AIDS cases in 145
countries. Thirty-two countries said they had no cases, according to
WHO's monthly epidemiological report for February.
   While not previously mentioning AIDS cases, Iran has reported
that nearly 450 hemophiliacs, or 14 percent of the country's known
hemophiliac total, carry the AIDS virus.
   The United States, which has 60 percent of all AIDS victims,
accounts for most of the new cases reported to WHO in February _
1,654. The U.S. total rose to 86,157 victims as of Feb. 16, WHO said.
   West Germany, which has the third-highest total in Europe after
France and Italy, reported 106 cases for a new total of 2,885. The
Netherlands reported 43 new cases, Britain 67, and South Africa 45.
   For Iran, the new WHO bulletin listed five cases as of Dec. 31.
Last month's bulletin showed no cases in Iran on Dec. 31, 1987.

   A federal appeals court upheld a decision
that 26 anti-abortion activists had violated racketeering laws with
their protests, a ruling one lawyer said ``strikes a blow at the
very heart'' of the anti-abortion movement.
   Abortion foes and their lawyers attacked the decision, calling it
a serious setback for people who practice civil disobedience.
   A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Thursday upheld a lower court decision that the protesters violated
racketeering laws by conspiring to prevent abortions at Northeast
Women's Center Inc., a Philadelphia clinic. The court also awarded
about $110,000 in damages and attorneys' fees to the center.
   The center's lawsuit was the first test of the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in a civil case against
abortion demonstrators, said Edmond A. Tiryak, the lawyer who
brought the action for the clinic.
   ``From our point of view, this is an important example that will
be used nationally,'' he said. The lawsuit has been used as a model
by other clinics in as many as 11 other cases still at the trial
level, he said.
   The center had charged that the protesters used force, threats
and trespassing to intimidate center employees and women seeking
abortions.
   ``What's been going on at the center has been intimidation and
fear,'' said Tiryak. ``This opinion, I think, strikes a blow at the
very heart of that activity by the pro-life movement.''
   An anti-abortion leader named in the suit lambasted the decision
but predicted it wouldn't stop future demonstrations.
   ``The American judicial system has taken a vengeance against
anyone who tries to stand up for children in the womb,'' said
Michael McMonagle, executive director of the Pro-Life Coalition of
Southeast Pennsylvania.
   Nevertheless, he said that since the lawsuit was filed in 1987,
``the rescue movement has taken off the ground, and RICO suits can't
stop it now.''
   The RICO Act has most often been used against organized crime
figures, but Tiryak said it was applicable in the case because
protesters used extortion _ in the form of threats and force _ to
deny the center its right to operate and to deny women their right
to use the center.
   The appelate panel unanimously upheld a June 1987 finding by a
federal district jury that the protesters had engaged in a pattern
of criminal activity from 1984 to 1986 designed to prevent the
center from providing abortions.
   The appeals court said videotapes made by the center ``revealed
demonstrators pushing, shoving and tugging on patients as they
attempted to approach the center, knocking over and crossing police
barricades and blocking the ingress of cars.''
   The court rejected the protesters' argument that their actions
were justified because of the issue, saying they could have used
numerous legal alternatives to persuade women not to have abortions
``short of harassment.''
   Tiryak contended the center lost its lease and was forced to move
because of the protests.
   McMonagle claimed no protester was ever charged with assault,
even though police were present at the demonstrations.
   ``Pushing doesn't make a racketeer, doesn't make extortionist,''
he said.
   McMonagle said the protesters will request that the full appeals
court review the decision by the three-judge panel.
   The appeals court ordered the district court to further consider
injunctions the center is seeking to limit the number of
demonstrators outside the center and prohibit them from using
bullhorns.
   Meanwhile, a federal judge in Los Angeles issued a temporary
restraining order barring the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue
from blockading women's health clinics in California during its
planned Easter week protests.
   U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter's order, which was sought by the
American Civil Liberties Union, instructs protesters to stay at
least 15 feet away from clinics.
   Operation Rescue leaders said they hoped to assemble 10,000
demonstrators in Los Angeles to blockade clinics from March 22-25.

   Laotians fleeing Communist persecution
have been forced back to their homeland by Thais, and ``hundreds, if
not thousands'' of them have died, a U.S. human rights group claimed
today in a report.
   A Thai Interior Ministry official denied his country had forced
anyone back. The official, speaking Thursday on condition of
anonymity, said the report could damage relations between Thailand
and Laos two weeks before scheduled talks on the repatriation of
Laotians.
   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in its report cited two
November 1987 cases in which Laotian soldiers allegedly massacred
groups of 33 and 16 Laotian hill people just after they were evicted
from Thai soil.
   The 64-page report, however, gave no evidence of more recent
large-scale killings. Western officials in Thailand involved in
refugee affairs said Thursday that Laotians seeking asylum are being
forced to return.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some
slayings have been reported, but they have no evidence of hundreds
of deaths.
   In the 1987 massacre of 33 people, which has been cited by other
sources, the report quoted the sole survivor, an 8-year-old girl.
She told the committee that the soldiers lined up the group, put
ropes around the necks of the adults, told the women to hold their
babies in front of them and opened fire.
   ``Thailand has a policy of systematically denying asylum by
pushing back Laotian asylum seekers on its northern border,'' the
report said. ``This has resulted in the deaths of hundreds, if not
thousands, of Laotians.''
   It said the policy ``represents a serious violation of human
rights and humanitarian principles.''
   In January, the New York-based lawyers' committee angered Thai
officials with a report saying that hundreds of Vietnamese boat
people died last year after Thai authorities forced them back to sea.
   Large numbers of Laotians have fled their homeland since the
Communists seized power in 1975. The persecution has been most
severe on the hill people, or Hmongs, whom the United States had
recruited to fight the Communists during the Indochina war.
   Thai officials say they must take tough measures to curb the
influx of Laotians because they say the United States and other
Western nations are not resettling enough of them.
   It said that along the border, the Laotians ``are routinely
subject to extortion, rape and other forms of brutality by
smugglers, Thai and Vietnamese-Pathet Lao (Laotian Communist)
security forces and other armed parties.''
   Under a U.N. program, Thailand is supposed to allow entry to all
Laotians into Thailand for an interview to determine whether they
fled political persecution or are economic migrants. But the report
said sections of the border are sealed off.
   Along other border areas, ``extortion and bribery are
widespread,'' with some Laotians having to pay Thai officials to
receive an interview, the report said.
   The report said that if fair procedures cannot be achieved, the
U.N. refugee agency should ``publicly denounce'' the interview
program.
   Western officials confirmed the abuses related to the screening.
   According to U.N. figures through December, the Thais screened
26,067 Laotians and admitted 22,492 of them as refugees.
   The report also criticized abuses by Thai officials in the
U.N.-aided camps housing about 76,000 Laotians. The camp commander
at Chiang Kham allegedly humiliated, tortured and raped refugees. He
was transferred in May 1988 but has not been prosecuted, the report
said.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Veterans' Lawsuit Over Flag Displayed On Floor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American flag that is spread on the floor at a
student art exhibit can stay put, a judge ruled, but students
protested school restrictions on who could see it.
   ``It is good to know that the flag has not lost its ability to
communicate ideas,'' Cook County Circuit Judge Kenneth Gillis said
in rejecting a lawsuit filed by veterans groups that sought to
prevent the flag from being displayed on the floor.
   The exhibit at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago ``is as
much an invitation to think about the flag as it is an invitation to
step on the flag,'' Gillis said.
   ``It seems to me that this country is large enough to permit this
expression,'' Gillis said. ``Expression is part of the equation that
makes this country strong.''
   While the judge ruled Thursday it is not illegal for the artist
to place the flag on the floor, he said it is unlawful for viewers
to step on it.
   Robert Jones, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said
he was ``very hurt'' by Gillis' dismissal of the lawsuit.
   ``The flag to me is a living thing and they don't have any right
to do that to it,'' Jones said. ``But we'll abide by the ruling.
It's a nation of laws.''
   Veterans contend the work invites viewers to trample the flag.
   The exhibit of students' work was reopened Thursday after
protests last week prompted a closure, but only students, faculty
and staff were permitted.
   Students immediately protested the limitation and urged the
exhibit be opened to the public and the media.
   ``Only in a space open to the public does freedom of expression
truly exist. Restricted viewing is censorship,'' Luis Brown, a
student spokesman, said at a rally outside the school as about 200
people cheered.
   Administrators said the limited reopening would preserve the
artist's rights while protecting the school and other students.
   ``Our main concern right now is to maintain security and to keep
the show open for faculty, staff and students,'' said Peter Brown,
the school's vice president.
   Scott Tyler, the artist, said at the rally that although the U.S.
flag symbolizes freedom to some people, it represents domination and
suppression to others.
   In his work, titled ``What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S.
Flag?'' a flag is spread on the floor in front of a montage of
photographs of flag-draped coffins, South Koreans burning the U.S.
flag and other scenes.
   Visitors are invited to comment in a ledger on a shelf below the
montage.

   Britain's foreign secretary said in an interview
broadcast today in Iran that ``The Satanic Verses'' offends Moslems
and British, but Iran's president said Britain will be ``forced to
apologize and retreat.''
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe of Britain made his comments
after the Iranian parliament voted Tuesday to break diplomatic ties
with Britain within one week if British officials refused to disavow
the controversial novel by Salman Rushdie.
   Howe said today the novel not only offended Moslems but also
insulted the British by comparing their country to Nazi Germany.
While carefully distancing his government from the novel, however,
Howe defended the right of Rushdie to publish the work.
   Iran's President Ali Khamenei shot back: ``Whether Britain
apologizes or not, there is no doubt that it will be forced to
apologize and retreat in the face of the great Islamic nation.'' His
remarks, reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, were
made at mass prayers today.
   In a commentary, the news agency spurned Howe's conciliatory
remarks. ``Though Geoffrey Howe seemed interested in ties with Iran
and agreed that the book has hurt Moslem feelings, his interview
showed no signs that the U.K. government has revised its stance on
the satanic work,'' IRNA said late Thursday. ``The interview made it
clear that he was playing with words.''
   IRNA also ridiculed what it called ``those stereotyped statements
of `the right of freedom to speak,' which have become customary of
British officials of late who seem to be unmoved by the injured
feelings of the planet's more than one billion Moslems.''
   The interview with Howe was broadcast by the British Broadcasting
Corp.'s Persian Service Thursday night and this morning, the BBC
said. It was to be repeated later today.
   British officials said Thursday they had rejected an Iranian
offer of negotiations, saying Iran must first renounce its call for
violence in the dispute.
   Iran claimed the overtures for conciliation came from Britain and
that Rushdie remains subject to ``divine justice.''
   Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on Feb.
14 told Moslems to kill Rushdie for the novel, which many Moslems
say is blasphemous. Iranian Moslem clergymen have offered a bounty
of $5.2 million for the death of the writer, who was born a Moslem
in India.
   Rushdie, now a British citizen, has been in hiding under police
protection with his American wife, novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   In his comments, Howe insisted there was no point talking to Iran
while the death threat against Rushdie remains in place.
   Howe said: ``We do understand that the book has been found deeply
offensive by people of the Moslem faith.
   ``I do emphasize that we are not upholding the right of freedom
to speak because we like the book, because we agree with the book.
The British government, the British people, do not have any
affection for the book.
   ``The book is extremely critical, rude about us. It compares
Britain with Hitler's Germany. We do not like that any more than the
people of the Moslem faith like the attacks on their faith contained
in the book.'' Howe did not elaborate.
   Rushdie, 41, is a fierce critic of Britain's colonial past and of
what he views as racial prejudice among whites toward minority
ethnic immigrants in Britain. In one passage in his book, an Indian
is beaten by British authorities and made to eat excrement.
   The dispute over the novel has roiled relations between Iran and
many western countries. Britain, its 11 partners in the European
Common Market, and several other nations have pulled their top
envoys from Iran, and Iran has retaliated in kind.
   Howe is to meet in Vienna on Monday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, who held talks over the weekend with Khomeini
and Iranian leaders. Soviet officials have indicated a willingness
to mediate the dispute.
   Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz on Thursday urged Moslem countries
to condemn Iran's call for assassinating Rushdie, but he also
proposed a boycott against publishers of Rushdie's book.
   Mahfouz, who last year became the first Arab to win the Nobel
Prize for Literature, made his comments in an article in the state
newspaper Al-Ahram.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is banned in Egypt, Iran, India, Pakistan
and several other countries. At least 18 people have died in
protests against the book in India and Pakistan.

   A tanker carrying 90,000 barrels of crude oil ran
aground in stormy seas about 15 miles from Hawaii's most popular
tourist area, spilling an estimated 117,000 gallons of fuel oil and
crude into the water, officials said.
   Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler said the 800-foot tanker
Exxon Houston sent a distress call at 8:20 p.m. Thursday off the
Hawaiian island of Oahu.
   The captain of the tanker reported the ship was ``hard aground''
three-tenths of a mile northwest of Barbers Point on Oahu's
southwest coast, about 15 miles west of the island's densely
populated area containing Honolulu and Waikiki Beach, its most
popular tourist area, Spangler said.
   ``They've told us their fuel tanks were completedly emptied,''
Spangler said.
   He said an estimated 92,000 gallons of fuel oil had leaked
through holes in the tanker's hull and 25,000 gallons of crude oil
had spilled.
   Spangler said it wasn't clear whether the crude leaked when the
tanker broke loose from its moorings in 12-to-14-foot seas, or
whether it spilled through holes in the hull. Officials don't know
if crude is continuing to leak, he added.
   Spangler said the Oahu Civil Defense Agency reported early today
that fuel oil was washing ashore on the beach at Barbers Point.
However, he said the length of shoreline affected probably wouldn't
be known until daybreak.
   Winds and ocean currents should direct the spill east toward
Honolulu, Spangler said. Earlier Coast Guard reports said rough seas
appeared to be dissipating the oil.
   Leonard Alcantara, a Honolulu attorney for Exxon, said the ship's
captain, Kevin Dick, and the 23-member crew have remained aboard and
were in no danger.
   ``They said they've suffered some damage, but they don't know how
much yet,'' Spangler said.
   The Exxon Houston was unloading Alaska North Slope oil at the
Hawaiian Independent Refinery at about 5:25 p.m. when a mooring line
broke, causing the offloading hoses to break, said Andrea Simpson, a
spokeswoman for Pacific Resources Inc., the refinery's parent
company.
   The vessel reported trouble but did not request Coast Guard
assistance when it broke its moorings, Spangler said.
   A total of nine commercial and U.S. Navy tugboats were dispatched
to help dislodge the tanker, and environmental specialists also were
en route, officials said.

   Terry Rakolta unexpectedly won a skirmish and now
she wants to start a battle against what she says are sexually
oriented and violent programs that cut into the network television
fare her children can watch.
   The 40-year-old mother of four, offended by the off-color humor
on the prime-time series ``Married ... With Children,'' conveyed her
distaste to the show's major advertisers in a flurry of letters
starting in January.
   Much to Mrs. Rakolta's surprise, the letters prompted two of the
nation's largest advertisers, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and McDonalds
Corp., and several others to pull their commercials from the series,
the top-rated program on the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Co. network.
   ``The American family is being painted into a corner. It's an
invasion of my privacy at this point,'' Mrs. Rakolta said Thursday.
   She said she objects to having to monitor prime-time television
for shows she doesn't want her younger children to watch. ``If
people want that stuff, they can pay for it, or rent it, or go to
the movies,'' she said.
   But Fox, which has tried to attract young adult audiences, has
had no trouble selling advertising time on the Sunday evening show
despite Mrs. Rakolta's efforts, said Fox spokesman Brad Turell in
Los Angeles.
   ``The show is completely sold out,'' he said, adding that reports
of Mrs. Rakolta's campaign have rallied support behind the show.
   ``We have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today
from across the country from viewers saying that this one woman's
opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we won't
change the show,'' Turell said.
   Mrs. Rakolta, who lives in the affluent suburb of Bloomfield
Hills and has three daughters, ages 18, 10 and 9, and a son, 8, said
she intends to start a group, or join existing ones, to organize
national boycotts of advertisers.
   Her writing campaign began one Sunday night in January when she
and her children watched ``Married ... With Children'' and she ended
up shooing the children out of the room.
   The situation comedy, which began in 1987, is about a blue-collar
family headed by shoe-store clerk Al Bundy.
   Mrs. Rakolta said the first show she saw featured a man's visit
to a lingerie store. ``In the store, one woman removed her bra for
strangers, asking how she looked. It showed a man that worked there,
an older man, walking around in a garter belt. They mentioned
vibrators on the show,'' Mrs. Rakolta said.
   ``I was thinking it was a family program because it was prime
time, 8:30 p.m. I was horrified. I wanted to know what kind of
sponsors would sponsor a show like this,'' she said.
   Mrs. Rakolta said she watched other episodes to see who
advertised, then stayed up to 4 a.m. writing letters.
   Since she wrote to them, Procter &amp; Gamble, McDonald's,
Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Tambrands Inc. have told their advertising
agencies not to buy time on the program.
   ``We felt that the whole theme of the show is basically one we do
not want to be associated with. We were concerned about the negative
portrayal of American family life,'' said Procter &amp; Gamble
spokeswoman Kelly Gillespie.
   The president of Coca-Cola USA, Ira Herbert, said his company
will screen future episodes more closely.
   Don R. Bay, a Fox vice president, defended the Bundy family as
``a comedic counterpoint to other fictional television families who
enjoy above average incomes, greater opportunities and have more
refined tastes.''
   Hal Katz, executive vice president of Vitt Media International
Inc., a New York ad buyer, said the amount of sex depicted on
television is rising dramatically, adding, ``As it increases,
advertisers become more sensitive to it.''
   But Paul Isaacson, vice president of Young &amp; Rubicam, a New York
advertising company, said complaints about shows' content appear no
more frequently than before.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said those who seek to
influence television content through pressure on advertisers are
attempting censorship.
   ``If you don't want to watch it then don't watch it,'' said Carol
Sobel, an ACLU attorney. ``I think what is inappropriate is to force
your views on anyone else.''

<HEAD>Man Wants Custody Of Frozen, Fertilized Eggs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A couple in the midst of a divorce are
fighting for custody of the fertilized eggs they put in frozen
storage a few years ago.
   Junior Lewis Davis, 30, says he does not want his wife, Mary Sue
Davis, 28, to become pregnant, and a judge has issued an order
temporarily blocking her from having the embryos implanted.
   Despite Davis' divorce petition and his objection to becoming a
father, Mrs. Davis has said she eventually plans to have the eggs
implanted, according to the complaint.
   Davis contends that he and wife jointly own the fertilized eggs
and that any plans to use the frozen embryos to become pregnant _ as
late as several years from now _ have an impact on his life.
   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young has agreed, and on Feb.
23 he issued the order that also prohibits Mrs. Davis from removing
any of the eggs from frozen storage pending further hearings.
   Seven of the couple's fertilized eggs are stored at Fort Sanders
Regional Medical Center, the complaint said.
   Davis told The Associated Press on Thursday he had no comment.
   Mary Sue Davis did not return a telephone call made to the
Knoxville company where she works.
   Charles M. Clifford, Davis' Maryville lawyer, said he would not
comment on the case.
   In in-vitro fertilization, the woman's ova are surgically removed
and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory container, then implanted
in the woman's womb in hopes of a pregnancy.
   Great Britain pioneered the practice and produced the world's
first ``test-tube baby'' in 1978.
   Since then, other infertile couples have resorted to the method,
which costs between $4,000 and $10,000 and has an approximately 15
percent success rate for each implant.

   The United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed to increases in their embassy staffs, reversing a cutback
forced by the Reagan administration after reporter Nicholas Daniloff
was accused in Moscow of spying.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Friday
that 18 positions were added last month to the U.S. Embassy in the
Soviet capital and to the Soviet Embassy here, along with two
additional slots at the U.S. and Soviet consulates in Leningrad and
San Francisco.
   On Aug. 1, Redman said, 13 additional slots will be added to each
of the embassies and two more to the consulates. The maximums then
would be 256 for the embassies and 30 for the consulates.
   Daniloff's arrest _ he was subsequently released _ touched off a
diplomatic tiff in which the Reagan administration in October 1986
imposed ceilings of 225 at the embassies and 26 at the consulates.
   This forced the Soviets, which had a bigger staff, to withdraw
about 80 workers.
   Explaining the reversal, Redman said the workload at the U.S.
Embassy and consulate had increased. More visas are being issued for
Soviets emigrating and for those going to the United States on
cultural exchanges.

<HEAD>Hijacked Plane's Steward Says Younis Pretended to Kill Guards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A steward from a Jordanian jet hijacked in 1985
testified Friday that accused sky pirate Fawaz Younis threatened to
kill passengers and crew and tricked them into believing his men had
shot the plane's security guards.
   The steward, Omar Suliman El Ghadi, 32, was the fifth witness in
the trial at U.S. District Court to identify Younis as the leader of
five heavily armed men who stormed aboard Royal Jordanian Airlines
flight 402 in Beirut on June 11, 1985.
   In the initial moments of the hijacking, El Ghadi testified,
Younis ran to the front of the Boeing 727, pounded on the locked
cockpit door with his gun and shouted, ``If you don't open the door,
I will explode it.''
   The hijackers were armed with AK-47 assault rifles and hand
grenades, according to testimony from other witnesses and a
videotape taken at the end of the 30-hour ordeal.
   The testimony by El Ghadi was the first during the five-day trial
to portray Younis as directly threatening the passengers and crew
with death.
   Younis, 30, has pleaded innocent to a six-count indictment
stemming from the hijacking.
   He was captured by FBI agents in international waters in the
Mediterranean Sea more than two years after the hijacking, on Sept.
13, 1987, and the trial is seen as a test of a 1984 statute in which
U.S. authorities assert ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over the taking of
American hostages abroad.
   Near the end of the hijacking, El Ghadi testified, the sky
pirates told passengers and crew that at 7 a.m. the following
morning, they would ``start killing'' them, ``the security officers
first.''
   The hijackers removed jewelry from a female security officer, and
led all nine of them off the plane.
   ``We heard gunfire,'' testified El Ghadi.
   Younis, called Nazeeh by the other hijackers, came back aboard
and said, ``That's it. We killed the security and put their bodies
in the cargo of the airplane.''
   The security officers were not, in fact killed, and El Ghadi said
that when he saw them later in Jordan, ``I was shocked.''
   El Ghadi began his testimony by describing the early moments of
the hijacking, as gunshots were heard outside the plane, passengers
streamed inside, knocking the sky marshals off balance, and the
hijackers ran aboard.
   The steward testified that he refused orders from the hijackers
to close the door of the airplane for take-off, and that a few
moments later, Younis emerged from the cockpit ``slapping and
pushing'' the flight engineer to the rear to close the door.
   Another hijacker, called ``No. 2'' by El Ghadi, then began to
beat the female security guard and threatened her with a knife. El
Ghadi intervened.
   ``Hijacker No. 2 put his submachine gun at the back of my head''
and ordered him to search her, the steward testified.
   After refueling in Cyprus, the hijackers ordered the plane flown
to Tunis, where they wanted to read a statement demanding that
Palestinians be removed from Lebanon. Tunisian authorities blocked
the runways with trucks and the plane returned to Beirut.
   The sky marshals were taken off the plane, followed several hours
later by the passengers and crew, most of whom shook hands with the
Younis as they left.
   El Ghadi said he refused to shake hands and was again threatened
with death but was allowed to board a bus with the other passengers
and crew.

<HEAD>School System Closes Early Due To Racial Tensions Over Rebel Flag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATER VALLEY, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Racial tensions sparked when several
white students waved Confederate flags during a black history
program prompted officials to close classes for spring vacation two
weeks early.
   ``We could tell this morning there was potential for disturbances
and decided to dismiss,'' school Superintendent Kenny Goodwin said
after students were sent home at 8:30 a.m. Friday.
   He said the week-long spring holiday would begin Monday instead
of March 20 and ``will be a cooling off period.''
   Authorities said no violence had been reported, but blacks had
walked off the football and baseball teams at the 600-student high
school and tensions were high.
   The problem developed Monday when several white students waved
Confederate flags during a program for black history month at the
high school. Goodwin said the five or six students who created the
disturbance had been disciplined but not all had been suspended.
   In protest of Monday's incident, black athletes began a boycott
of the football and baseball teams.
   Several black students interviewed after school Thursday said
they dropped out of sports activities because they were ``hurt by
what the white kids did.''
   Some of the whites involved in the flag incident were members of
the football team, said one black player who asked not to be
identified. ``We've been playing with them all this time and then
they do that. ... It hurt us,'' he said.
   The Oxford Eagle quoted sources close to the football and
baseball teams as saying most of the players were boycotting at the
request of their parents. One parent, who also asked not to be
identified, said athletes would not return to the teams ``until we
say they can.''
   About 60 parents of black students met Thursday night with
Goodwin and high school Principal Jerry Holt to discuss the problem.
Goodwin said no real progress was made but people ``got to vent
their frustrations.''
   ``There wasn't as much tension at school Thursday but things kind
of became inflamed late yesterday and last night,'' Goodwin said in
announcing his decision.
   He said school administrators would report for work next week
during the rescheduled holiday break and would be available to
discuss problems with parents and students.

<HEAD>City Tells Church to Move Because It's Too Close to Liquor Store</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINTER GARDEN, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saying the law works both ways,
officials are forcing a storefront church to move because it's too
close to a liquor store and lounge.
   Residents of this community near Orlando voted in 1984 to change
the city charter to prohibit business within 1,200 feet of a school
or church from selling liquor. The intent may have been to protect
churchgoers and schoolchildren, city commissioners said, but in this
case, the liquor store was there first _ by 24 years, so the Oakview
Baptist Church will have to leave.
   The 40-member church, which holds services on Sundays and
Wednesdays, moved into the one-room office in September.
   Part-time pastor Don Voss, a school bus driver, says moving would
be a hardship. The 5-year-old church has moved several times and had
only $5 in its treasury after he paid last month's rent of $375, he
said Thursday.
   He questioned why the city didn't catch the infraction earlier.
   The congregation is made up of fruit pickers, house cleaners, bus
drivers and security guards. ``We just barely can make it. We don't
have much income,'' said Voss, who is not paid a salary.
   A member of the code enforcement board raised the issue when
commissioners met with three city boards last month. The city
attorney was asked to research the question, and he reported last
week that the church violated the city charter. The law cannot be
changed without a voter referendum.
   ``Personally, I wish nobody had brought it up,'' said
Commissioner John Rees.
   Commissioner Theo Graham, who was instrumental in the petition
drive that got the 1,200-foot restriction on the ballot, said, ``The
intent was not to stop a church from coming in. If they want to be
that close to a bar, that's their business.''
   The city code enforcement officer, Glen Venable, said the church
had 30 days to leave.

<HEAD>Orders Down 1.3 Percent in January Due to Transportation Declines</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy, Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods
declined 1.3 percent in January, reflecting a fallback in demand for
transportation equipment from record levels a month earlier, the
government reported Friday.
   Analysts said that despite the overall decline, the report
provided evidence of continued strength in the economy.
   Excluding transportation, orders were up 0.2 percent in January
after a 1.8 percent rise in December.
   The category of non-defense capital goods, viewed as a barometer
of future industry investment plans, rose 1.6 percent in January to
$40.1 billion.
   ``There may be a little more strength in investment than we had
previously thought,'' said economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group,
a forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   Overall, orders for durable and non-durable manufactured goods
fell to a seasonally adjusted $235.8 billion in January after
posting a 4.7 percent increase in December, the Commerce Department
reported.
   It was the first decline in factory orders since a 1.9 percent
drop in September.
   The decline was attributed to a retreat in demand for ships,
tanks and planes that resulted in an 8.5 percent decline in orders
for transportation equipment last month. The category had surged
22.1 percent during the previous month to a record $39.6 billion.
   The motor vehicle, aircraft and shipbuilding industries all had
posted large gains in December.
   Defense orders, subject to wide swings depending on when
contracts are signed, plunged 33.9 percent in January to $6.9
billion after a 24 percent surge in December.
   Excluding the military, orders were up 0.2 percent in January
after a 4 percent gain in December.
   Analysts expect economic growth to slow this year as the Federal
Reserve Board continues to tighten its grip on the money supply to
cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures.
   But most economic reports for January have signaled continued
strength in the economy at the start of the new year.
   Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co. in New York, said January's factory orders figures were
``consistent with the feeling that the economy is still growing at a
respectable rate.''
   For all of 1988, orders for manufacturers' goods were up 9.7
percent, the best showing since 1979, after posting a 7.1 percent
gain during 1987.
   American manufacturing was bolstered by strong demand for exports
in the past two years as the decline in the value of the dollar
against foreign currencies made U.S. products more competitive in
the international marketplace.
   In January, orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods _ items
expected to last three years or longer _ were down 2.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $128.5 billion.
   Demand for non-durable goods, meanwhile, was up 0.5 percent to
$107.3 billion.
   Shipments of manufacturered goods were up 0.3 percent in January
to a seasonally adjusted $231.6 billion.

   An oil slick was spotted today off sensitive marine
reserves in the northern Florida Keys, but Coast Guard officials
said the spill did not appear to be a threat to the area.
   A flyover by Coast Guard officials found the slick was 2 miles
long and a quarter-mile wide, much smaller than first reported.
   ``It's not as bad as we feared,'' Coast Guard spokesman Joe Dye
said.
   Parks in the area reported small gobs of tar washing up, and said
there did not appear to be major damage.
   Dye said dead birds were found out near the oil, but it was not
clear if they were killed by the slick.
   A fisherman reported the oil just before 10 a.m., Dye said.
   ``We have no idea where it came from,'' he said. ``There are
apparently no ships in the area.''
   The Gulf Stream runs past Key Largo at that point, which means
the oil could have come north from Cuba or even farther away.
   The oil floated close to two sensitive north Key Largo marine
reserves _ the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary and John
Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park.
   Pennekamp boasts the nation's only shallow-water living coral
reef, which also extends into the federal Key Largo reserves.
   Coast Guard and park officials will consult to decide whether to
order booms placed around the slick immediately and send boats to
clean up the oil, Dye said.
   Although the Coast Guard said the spill was 10 to 12 miles
offshore, there were reports of tar balls at the 120-square-mile Key
Largo reserve, said park spokeswoman Maddy Hoover.
   ``We don't know too much just yet, but we've gotten reports that
we've got crude oil and tar balls from the size of baseballs to the
size of grapefruit,'' she said.
   The 20-mile-long reserve stretches north from Molasses Point off
the Atlantic shore of Key Largo, and includes the area outside the
3-mile limit, while Pennekamp includes the shoreline and out to the
3-mile limit in some of the same areas, she said.

<HEAD>Soldiers, Gov't Workers Struggle to Flee War-Torn Tigray</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHEGE MBITIRU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops and workers ordered to
abandon war-torn northern Ethiopia to rebels, were stranded Friday
for lack of transport, an African diplomat said.
   ``I understand it will take them a long time before they can
return,'' the foreign envoy said in a telephone interview from
Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.
   If troops, civil servants and other officials abandon Tigray
province, as ordered Monday by the government, that would leave the
administration with no overland access to Eritrea, the extreme
northern province that has the East African nation's only ports. The
government still is flying planes into Assab and Massawa, its main
ports on the Red Sea.
   The retreat follows a series of rebel victories which the
government referred to indirectly Thursday in a statement urging
Ethiopians ``to be ready for an active involvement in every area of
the armed struggle.''
   ``No nation can tolerate violence, and there is no alternative
now except to join hands and diffuse the aggression launched against
the Ethiopian people,'' said the statement, published by the
official Ethiopian News Agency.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did
not know if rebels have moved into towns in northern Tigray province
evacuated by the government.
   ``There are no government troops fighting there,'' he said.
``Even those who are left are in southern Tigray. There are no
government officials in the north.''
   The government did not refer directly to Tuesday reports by
insurgents that the government had evacuated Tigray's provincial
capital, Mekele, ``fearing humiliating and shaking defeat as in Enda
Selassie and surrounding areas.''
   Enda Selassie is near Mekele, 475 miles northwest of Addis Ababa.
   ``The whole of Tigray is now liberated from the fascist regime of
Mengistu,'' rebel spokesman Yemane Kidane told a reporter in Sudan's
capital, Khartoum.
   The government said ``the secessionist TPLF and the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front had coordinated attacks against Ethiopian
army along Adwa, Aksum and Enda Selassie route with the view to
dismember the Ethiopian Red Sea area from the rest of the country.''
   Kidane said Tigrean rebels destroyed Ethiopia's 206th army corps,
killing and wounding 14,645 soldiers and capturing 12,975, including
a general. Rebel claims often are exaggerated and there was no way
to verify Kidane's statement.
   Early last year, Tigrean and Eritrean rebels in a joint offensive
captured several towns, which the government retook in a midyear
counteroffensive.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence since 1962 in

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa on
Friday named his Finance Minister Dingiri Banda Wijetunga to serve
as prime minister in a plan that involves rotating the post among
Cabinet members.
   Wijetunga was chosen at a meeting of the ruling United National
Party. He will hold the post, which consists primarily of executing
government programs, for one year, a presidential communique said.
   Wijetunge, 67, will be sworn in Monday.
   Wijetunga joined the ruling party in 1946. He has headed the
ministries of power and highways, telecommunications, food and
agriculture, development, and research and information and
broadcasting.
   Premadasa, who was elected to a six-year term in December, has
decided to rotate the prime minister job among the 21 Cabinet
members, the communique said.

   Twenty-one laid-off police officers are
being called back to work because a drive by residents, churches and
businesses raised more than the $90,000 needed to pay them, the
mayor of this strapped steel town said Friday.
   ``I'm overwhelmed by how the people opened up their hearts and
pocketbooks,'' said Mayor Lou Washowich. ``We're a struggling
community trying to make some type of economic recovery.''
   Organizers of the drive to collect $90,000 said the total reached
$94,000 by noon Friday.
   Washowich said the officers, nearly half the force, would return
to work Sunday, one week after being laid off.
   ``This past week, while it's been very busy, the good Lord must
have been watching us because we didn't have anything terrible
happen,'' Police Chief Thomas Brletic said.
   The mayor had asked all employees to take a wage freeze after the
city discovered a $1.3 million deficit late last year, and he had
said layoffs would result if the request was refused.
   Washowich ordered the police layoffs after a panel of state
arbitrators awarded the police department 4 percent to 4{ percent
pay raises. He said the city would save $90,000 by laying off the 21
officers for three months. Twenty-nine officers remained on the job.
   The city's volunteer ambulance company, McKeesport Emergency
Medical Services, launched the fund-raising drive with a $15,000
donation.
   Residents dropped money into cans at churches, clubs, restaurants
and businesses, and the ambulance company recorded the fund total
each day on a cardboard thermometer posted at its station.
   The money includes the contributions of Equibank, which agreed to
match every donation dollar for dollar.
   ``From the beginning I thought we would get the money, but I'm
surprised we got it this quick,'' said Brian Gregg, recording
secretary of the ambulance company.
   Funeral home owner Felix Jaworski donated $200.
   ``I just want to help our police force,'' he said. ``They do a
lot for me here. We have a lot of vandalism around here and all I do
is give them a call and they're on their way.''
   Washowich said the success of the fundraiser won't solve the
city's money problems and he has no idea how McKeesport will pay for
the next year's police wage increase.
   ``I'm sorry to say the reality will set in,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Moves to Tighten Ozone Emissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush called Friday for banning the
production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals entirely by the end
of the century if adequate substitutes can be found.
   The moves to protect the world's ozone layer, which shields the
earth from much of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, came
on the heels of a decision Thursday by 12 European countries to
pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on
production, as the world's industrial nations had earlier agreed to
do.
   The United States accounts for about one-third of the production
of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air
conditions and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer
equipment.
   Richard K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
had sought the stronger administration position on CFCs prior to his
departure Friday for London where representatives from more than 100
nations are meeting to discuss the ozone-depletion problem.
   Reilly, according to administration sources, had strongly
recommended at a White House meeting Thursday that the United States
should join its European allies and call for the complete
elimination of CFCs, as opposed to cutting production by only 50
percent as required by current treaty.
   Under a 1987 treaty, the industrial nations are committed to
halving CFC production by the year 2,000, but many scientists have
said that such a cutback would not be enough to protect against
serious ozone depletion.
   On Thursday, the 12 nations of the European Economic Community
announced in Brussels, Belgium, that they have agreed to a total ban
on the chemical in their countries by the end of the century. Reilly
is known to have wanted to carry a similar commitment with him to
the London conference, which is scheduled to begin Sunday.
   ``We intend to reaffirm the strong position of the United States
about chlorofluorocarbon manufacture and use,'' Reilly said Friday,
adding that ``we intend to maintain our leadership'' among the
world's nations in dealing with the ozone-depletion problem.
   Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it
does not break down at lower altitudes and floats into the
stratosphere, where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseous
veil of ozone that shields against the sun's cancer-causing
ultraviolet rays.
   After scientists detected increasing ozone depletion, the
industrial nations agreed in September, 1987 to a pledge of sharp
cut in the production of ozone-depleting chemicals _ primarily CFCs
but also three halon chemicals _ by the end of 1999.
   The treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, including the
United States, Japan, most of Western Europe and Soviet Union. But
it includes a provision that allows additional measures, including a
complete ban, if further ozone damage is found.
   The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an
accelerated phase out schedule _ which is provided for in the 1987
accord _ at a meeting in Helsinki in early May. The meeting that
will begin Sunday in London, attracting representatives from more
than 100 nations, is described as a dress rehearsal for the Helsinki
session.
   According to the World Resources Institute, the United States
produces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. DuPont de
Nemours &amp; Co. the world's largest producer. There were 750 million
pounds of CFCs produced in the United States last year and about the
same amount in Western Europe, according to Dupont.
   Dupont, which accounts for about half of the U.S. production, has
announced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as the
mid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year.
   ``We think in the mid-90s is when we'll see the wide scale
introduction of the alternatives,'' said Catherine Forte, a Dupont
spokeswoman said in a telephone interview. The manufacturers of
packaging for many food containers already have stopped using CFCs
as a blowing agent in the formulation of plastics.
   But industry and EPA officials have acknowledged continuing
problems in developing adequate CFC substitutes for some uses. A
substitute for CFCs used widely as a cleaning solvent for computer
and electrical equipment has been particularly difficult, suggested
industry experts.
   The EPA is still conducting toxicity tests for a number of the
CFC substitutes, said agency spokesman Chris Rice. Ms. Forte at
Dupont also said the substitutes ``are going to be more difficult to
produce than the existing product.''

<TEXT>
   White chocolate will be the hot chocolate of the
'90s, food experts at a convention of chefs say. The drink of choice
at coffeehouses and ski lodges soon may be white chocolate
cappuccino.
   Europeans have enjoyed white chocolate for years, but the
confection has gone largely ignored in the United States. Because
federal regulations forbid the term ``white chocolate,''
manufacturers were wary of marketing the candy. The success of
Nestle's White Alpine candy bar, introduced in 1985, has changed all
that.
   Marty Friedman, editor of the Florida-based New Product News,
named white chocolate as one of the top 15 new food trends during
this week's International Association of Food Professionals
convention.
   ``It's the last unexplored avenue in the chocolate world,'' said
Janice Wald Henderson, West Coast editor of Chocolatier magazine and
author of a white chocolate cookbook. ``White chocolate was the last
stone unturned.''
   Henderson's cookbook contains recipes for white chocolate
waffles, white chocolate pound cake, white hot chocolate, white
chocolate bread pudding and white chocolate German cake.
   ``It's a big hit now,'' said Liz Echendia, co-publisher of The
Confectioner, a national trade publication. ``It's a new taste that
hasn't been around before.''
   White chocolate, introduced in Switzerland after World War I,
comes from the cocoa bean and differs from milk chocolate and dark
chocolate only in that it lacks a liquid chocolate extract, the
substance that gives standard chocolate its ``bitter, sharper
flavor,'' according to chocolate experts.
   ``It has many of the flavor notes of milk chocolate but it has a
lighter, cleaner taste,'' said Carl Anderson, a vice president of
Nestle Foods Corp. in White Plains, N.Y., where the 40-cent Alpine
White with Almonds bar has become one of the top-selling 25 candy
bars in the country.
   Nestle circumvented the white chocolate definition problem by
describing the contents of the bar as ``what Europeans call `white
chocolate''' on the back of the label. Otherwise, it's referred to
only as ``Alpine White.''
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if deep down inside, people think it
has less calories than other chocolate,'' said Friedman. ``It looks
so pristine and white. It's one of the biggest successes in the
candy world.''
   Nestle also sells white chocolate chips, white chocolate-coated
ice cream bars and bulk white chocolate for individual consumers and
candy manufacturers.
   Anderson attributed the popularity of white chocolate to a
general trend among consumers for ``lighter food.''
   ``You're seeing a move away from harder brown liquors to rum and
vodka, you'll be seeing lighter soft drinks, people are eating more
fish and chicken than beef,'' he said. ``We have some research
showing that thewhite color and cleaner taste is appealing.''
   Henderson also has a theory about why people like white chocolate.
   ``I love the texture, it's exceptionally creamy and rich,'' she
said. ``That's what good desserts are all about. Otherwise, eat an
apple.''

   Navy personnel using chemical solvents
cleaned up the second oil spill in Antarctica in a month, a
spokesman said Friday.
   A half-mile-long oil slick had spread from a leak in the Peruvian
research vessel Humboldt after it ran aground at the entrance to
Marion Cove on King George island before midnight Sunday.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cristian Carbone, speaking from Punta Arenas,
Chile, said the chemical solvents used by personnel from the Chilean
vessel Yelcho, ``worked just fine.''
   ``The slick was very light, and the problem has been taken care
of,'' Carbone said.
   He said frogmen from the Yelcho as well as nearby Uruguayan and
South Korean Antarctic stations sealed the Humboldt's two damaged
oil tanks and fuel was no longer leaking.
   Chilean and Argentine personnel, as well as officers from the
Humboldt, are preparing to float the ship, which is wedged onto a
flat rock and sand surface, the navy spokesman said.
   The Humboldt was not seriously damaged, Carbone said.
   On Jan. 28, an Argentine navy ship, the Bahia Paraiso, ran
aground off the Antarctic peninsula creating a major oil slick,
which was cleaned in an operation involving ships from Argentina,
Chile and the United States.

<TEXT>
   A parole board denied early release Friday to
Bernhard Goetz, who is serving a one-year jail sentence for
illegally possessing the gun he used to shoot four teen-agers on a
New York City subway in 1984.
   A short statement by the state Board of Parole said releasing
Goetz after just two months ``would deprecate the seriousness of the
crime and undermine respect for the law.''
   Edward Elwin, executive director of the parole board, said the
decision means Goetz has to serve his full sentence minus any time
off for good behavior, unless he gets a court to overturn the
board's ruling.
   Goetz could have been released Monday if the board had ruled the
other way, said Elwin.
   Goetz is ``angry. He's frustrated,'' said his lawyer, Mark Baker.
``He doesn't belong there.''
   ``It's probably one of the most political decisions that's ever
come down the pike,'' Baker said. ``Anybody in power is afraid to do
something that favors Bernhard Goetz for fear of being labeled a
racist by the fringe elements. So he sits and rots.''
   Baker said the decision might be appealed.
   Goetz, 41, was convicted on the gun charge, but acquitted of
attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment charges. The
case drew international attention. Some people called the white
radio technician a racist vigilante for shooting four black young
men who were merely panhandling. Supporters hailed Goetz as a hero
who resisted a robbery.
   In turning Goetz down for parole, the board noted that Goetz had
fired his gun repeatedly.
   ``It is clear from the record that the present one-year sentence
for this Class-D felony, which can have a maximum sentence of seven
years, was imposed after careful and thoughtful consideration of the
circumstances of the case and the subject's background,'' said the
board's statement.
   Goetz began serving his sentence Jan. 13 after appeals in the
state courts failed to reverse his conviction. On Monday, the U.S.
Supreme Court also refused to reverse it.
   Had Goetz not appealed his conviction, he probably would have
ended up serving considerably less time in jail. While upholding the
conviction, state appeals courts also ruled that Goetz had been
sentenced incorrectly. The trial judge had given him six months. At
his court-ordered re-sentencing, Goetz was given the one-year term.
   Goetz is serving his sentence in New York City's Rikers Island
jail, where he has been repairing radios for the police and fire
departments.
   Elwin said Goetz got the standard treatment the parole board
gives city jail inmates. One member, whom he would not identify,
reviewed the prisoner's record and letters sent in by the judge,
prosecutor and defense lawyers, Elwin said.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole told Congress on
Friday that President Bush will veto any attempt to raise the
minimum wage beyond the administration's goal of $4.25 an hour at
the end of three years, and unless the legislation includes a
``training wage'' for all newly hired workers.
   Mrs. Dole's blunt warning came as she formally presented the plan
to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, setting the
administration strongly against a plan by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and majority Democrats that would raise the hourly minimum
to $4.65.
   She contended the Democratic plan, similar to one that died under
opposition by then-President Reagan last year, would cost 650,000
jobs.
   Bush's plan would raise the $3.35 minimum wage, unchanged since
1981, by 30 cents an hour a year until it reaches $4.25 an hour in
1991. All new workers hired at the minimum could be paid $3.35 an
hour for the first six months of their employment.
   ``Any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable
because it would decrease job opportunities,'' Mrs. Dole said.
``Legislation outside these parameters would call for a veto.''
   Kennedy told Mrs. Dole he hoped that ``we're not getting hit with
a take it or leave it.''
   Mrs. Dole said bluntly, ``The president has signed up for $4.25
an hour. and not higher.
   ``$4.25 is it,'' she said, waving her hand.
   The Labor committee will consider the bill Kennedy introduced
with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who has said he wants a
floor debate and vote on the question by the end of the month.
   Under the ``training wage,'' all workers hired at the minimum
could be paid $3.35 an hour for six months before they are covered
by the higher standard. Kennedy and other key Democrats and
organized labor have opposed setting a lower standard for any
workers, which organized labor fears could cause companies to layoff
higher-paid workers in favor of those who can be paid less.
   Twelve states and the District of Columbia have raised the
minimum wage in laws that take precedence over the federal standard
inside their borders, according to the Labor Department. California
and Connecticut have the highest minimum at $4.25 an hour, although
D.C. has a $4.85 floor for some workers.
   The other states with minimums higher than the federal government
are Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

<HEAD>Gandhi Proposes Political Package To End Sikh Turmoil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced
political initiatives Friday to help heal the ethnic rift with
rebellious Sikhs in the prosperous farming state of Punjab, news
reports said.
   Gandhi said he will free most people detained in the 1984 army
raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar; rescind legislation allowing
detention without trial; and allow foreigners to travel around most
of northwestern Punjab state.
   Opposition and ruling party legislators, including some who
support Sikh militants, loudly thumped their desks in a traditional
expression of approval when Gandhi announced the initiatives in
Parliament, United News of India agency said.
   Gandhi gave no time frame for the measures, Indian TV said.
   ``This is a step in the right direction. It is better late than
never,'' said Sikhdev Singh Dhindsa, a former Punjab state transport
minister and member of the United Akali Dal, a Sikh party
sympathetic to Sikh militants.
   Dhindsa told The Associated Press the measures would help solve
ethnic strife that began in 1982 when Sikh militants began a bloody
insurrection in demand of an independent homeland in Punjab.
   Referring to the release of the Jodhpur detenus, so called
because most were detained in Jodhpur jail in Rajasthan state after
the temple raid, Dhindsa said ``other innocent people in Punjab
jails should also be released.''
   Some 300 people were arrested in the Golden Temple complex during
the 1984 army raid ordered by Gandhi's mother, assassinated Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.
   Most were pilgrims held for questioning for complicity with Sikh
militants who were holed up inside the temple complex. About 150
still are detained, many without charge.
   Gandhi said all except those who face specific criminal charges
will be released soon, UNI said.
   Foreigners will be permitted regular access to Punjab and barred
only from areas declared severely ``disturbed'' or overrun by
militants, UNI quoted Gandhi as saying. Presently, all foreigners
except accredited journalists need special permission to visit
Punjab.
   Gandhi also said he will rescind special provisions of the
National Security Act allowing people in Punjab to be detained
without charge for six months, UNI said.
   He told legislators the government also will curtail emergency
powers given police under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities
Act, the news agency said.
   Village defense forces will be revived, Gandhi said, so people
rely less on police for help against militants.
   Village-level elections will be held between May and September,
Gandhi said, and committees based on the elections will supervise
development work and law and order.
   Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of India's population, but
they are in a slight majority in Punjab, India's agricultural boom
state.
   Militant Sikhs claim they are discriminated against by a
government dominated by the overwhelming Hindu majority, who are 82
percent of India's 880 million people.
   Militants wield enormous clout on the plea they are defending the
Sikh religion from being swamped by Hinduism.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed by two Sikh bodyguards to avenge
the assault on the temple that is Sikhism's most holy place.
   In 1988, the militants killed 2,400 people, mostly Hindus and
moderate Sikhs opposed to their campaign for a separate homeland.
   Punjab state legislature is suspended and the state is under
President's Rule, administered directly by New Delhi.

   Novelist Salman Rushdie said Friday he is disturbed
by his own government's criticism of ``The Satanic Verses,'' the
book that brought him a death sentence in Iran.
   Rushdie, in a call to the office of opposition legislator Paddy
Ashdown, said he believed the British government ``is beginning to
play both ends against the middle,'' said an aide to Ashdown who
took the call.
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei predicted his nation would
prevail. ``Today the West is not facing our nation, but Islam and
the the Islamic nation and this wave will grow by the day,'' the
Iranian news agency IRNA quoted him as saying at Friday prayers in
Tehran.
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, pronounced
Rushdie a heretic and sentenced him to death on Feb. 14. Iranian
clergymen have offered as much as $5.2 million to the person who
kills Rushdie.
   Rushdie, 41, a British citizen born in India, and his wife, the
American novelist Marianne Wiggins, have been in hiding under police
guard since the sentence was pronounced.
   ``From now on anyone who wants to write these things, or to make
a film out of it will wait for death threats from Moslems who have
accepted the Imam's fatwa (death sentence) and want to carry it
out,'' Khamenei said.
   IRNA said the crowds interrupted the sermon with chants of ``God
is great!'' and ``death to Britain!''
   The ``Satanic Verses'' affair sundered relations that had only
recently been restored. Moderates within the Iranian government have
been eager for Western assistance in rebuilding their country after
a long war against Iraq, while Britain has sought Iran's help in
gaining the release of three of its citizens held hostage in
Lebanon. Britain is also seeking the release of a citizen jailed in
Iran on charges of spying.
   The affair has cost Britain commercial opportunities. A.G. Plint,
managing director of Plint and Partners Ltd., complained in a letter
to The Times of London on Friday that his company stands to lose an
order worth $170,000.
   One death was reported Friday in clashes between police and
anti-Rushdie protests in the northern Indian city of Srinagar.
Police fired on Moslem demonstrators, killing at least one person
and injuring more than 100, authorities said.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said again Friday that
Rushdie's right to free speech was fundamental, but that the book is
offensive, and not just to Moslems.
   ``Freedom of speech is important, even in relation to a book
which has plainly caused offense in the Moslem community, and is
capable of causing offense to others,'' Howe said in Birmingham.
   In an interview Thursday on BBC radio, Howe emphasized ``that we
are not upholding the right of freedom to speak because we like the
book,'' and complained that the book ``compares Britain with
Hitler's Germany.''
   Alison Holmes, an Irish affairs researcher in Ashdown's office
who spoke to Rushdie, said the writer ``was worried that being
anti-Tory is now equated with being anti-British, because obviously
the government has found that there are some anti-government
statements in the book.''
   Ms. Holmes said Rushdie denied Howe's claim that the book drew
comparisons between Britain and Nazi Germany. ``He wanted Mr. Howe
to show him any sentence in his book that warranted a comparison to
Nazi Germany,'' she said.
   Ashdown, leader of the 19 Social and Liberal Democrats in the
650-seat House of Commons, said he shared Rushdie's concern.
   ``In my view, the government is now shifting ground, and it is a
matter of, I think, the deepest and gravest concern, that this
government, supposed to be a government in favor of the freedom of
liberty, is not prepared to stand up and defend, it appears to me,
the most basic freedom of all, which is the freedom of speech,''
Ashdown told Independent Television News.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told BBC-TV she understood that
Moslems had been hurt, just as Christians had been ``deeply hurt''
by some things directed at them.
   However, she said, ``I think that these great religions are
strong enough and deep enough to withstand these kind of events.''
   On Thursday, Britain's Foreign Office said it had rejected
Iranian proposals for a meeting to discuss the crisis, and that no
meeting was possible until Iran renounced violence.
   In other developments Friday:
   _ In Bangladesh, police lobbed tear gas and charged with batons
into demonstrators who tried to raid Dhaka University's
British-owned library. No injuries were reported.
   _ About 6,000 Moslems staged a peaceful anti-Rushdie
demonstration outside the British Embassy in the Hague, the
Netherlands, police said.
   _ In Turkey, about 400 Moslem protesters burned the British flag
and a picture of Rushdie after prayers at Istanbul's biggest mosque,
the Anatolia news agency reported.

<HEAD>Brady, Darman Meet Congressional Leaders to Discuss Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White
House Budget Director Richard Darman met with congressional leaders
Friday in a renewed effort to open negotiations on President Bush's
$1.16 trillion spending plan.
   After the two hours of closed-door talks, Democratic leaders
indicated that they believed serious discussions would begin perhaps
as soon as next week.
   Since Bush unveiled his budget on Feb. 9, he has been pushing to
start bargaining talks with Congress on a 1990 spending plan in
order to assure financial markets that progress is being made in
reducing the budget deficit, which is expected to hit $170 billion
this year.
   Congressional Democrats had refused to say whether they would be
willing to bargain with the administration, insisting instead that
Bush needed to spell out in greater detail the spending cuts he
would seek in order to reduce the 1990 deficit below $100 billion.
   While Darman has been meeting for the past three weeks with
members of the budget committees, those sessions have been described
as fact-finding talks in which the Democrats were searching for the
fine print in the Bush budget.
   Democrats have been insisting that the administration spell out
some $10 billion in unspecified savings Bush is seeking in scores of
domestic programs in order to meet his deficit reduction goals.
   Democrats have complained that Bush has wanted to take credit for
boosting spending in such areas as education and the war on drugs
while making the Democratic-controlled Congress take the blame for
cutting programs or boosting taxes to pay for Bush's increases.
   On Friday, House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., said he believed the fact-finding phase of the discussions
was essentially at an end and it would now be up to Democratic
leaders in Congress to decide whether to authorize direct
negotiations with the administration.
   Panetta characterized Friday's discussions as a talk about what
format the actual bargaining should take and who should participate.
   ``It would be fair to say that there is some movement toward
beginning negotiations with the administration,'' Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., told reporters after the
meeting.
   ``We have still got some hoops to go through before we get into
negotiations, but I am hopeful,'' Sasser said.
   Both Sasser and Panetta stressed that they viewed the effort to
draft a 1990 budget as a two-track process involving both the normal
congressional committee hearings and the negotiations with the
administration.
   ``In the event that these negotiations are unsuccessful, then we
could carry on with the budget process and hit our targets (for
completing work on a budget) as required by statute,'' Sasser said.
   April 15 is the deadline for Congress to produce an initial
budget resolution establishing broad spending guidelines for the
1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, said that ``time is running out so some
decisions will have to be made.'' He said various options had been
explored but no final decisions were made at the Friday meeting.
   Darman and Brady walked past reporters without pausing to answer
questions. While Darman has been meeting on a regular basis with
ranking Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate budget
committees, it was the first time that Brady had gone to the Capitol
to participate in the talks.
   Darman last week predicted in a meeting with reporters that
serious talks would begin within two weeks, in part because the
Democrats would realize that the sessions would prove to be to their
benefit.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who also
participated in the discussions Friday, said: ``We are nearing the
end of one phase of the discussions and looking at the next step.''

   A group opposed to the death penalty said
Friday it gave U.N. officials petitions with more than 1 million
signatures denouncing such punishment and asking clemency for a
woman on death row in Indiana.
   The Indiana Supreme Court is considering an appeal of the murder
conviction of Paula Cooper, 19, who is held at the Indiana Women's
Prison in Indianapolis.
   Ms. Cooper was 15 in 1985 when she and three other teen-agers
from Gary, Ind., robbed and killed Ruth Elizabeth Pelke, a
78-year-old retired Bible teacher. Ms. Pelke was stabbed at least 30
times with a butcher knife.
   ``Thou Shalt Not Kill,'' an Italian anti-death penalty group,
presented petitions with more than 1 million signatures appealing
for mercy for Ms. Cooper to U.N. officials.
   Members of the group say they have also sent more than 2 million
signatures gathered throughout Europe to Indiana officials,
including an appeal Pope John Paul II issued in 1987.
   The United Nations does not issue appeals for clemency in death
penalty cases unless they involve political crimes or violations of
human rights. The Italians conceded Ms. Cooper's case did not fit
those categories.
   Roman Catholics and some leftist groups in Europe have adopted
Ms. Cooper as the figurehead of their campaign against capital
punishment. Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties
Union also have called for mercy.
   ``We're talking about a girl in the flower of her youth, in the
prime of life,'' said Don Germano Greganti, the president of ``Thou
Shalt Not Kill.''
   ``In a sense, it's the defense of the ultimate person _ an
adolescent, someone who needs the support of family and the
political structure to complete her growth,'' said Greganti.
   Greganti also noted that Ms. Cooper is black, ``and black people
have been subject to a great deal of intolerence and
discrimination.''
   ``She has murdered someone,'' said Paolo Pietrosanti, another
member of the group, ``but we also say that the most vile homicide
is that which is perpetrated and premeditated by the largest number
of people.
   ``This premeditated homicide itself is the death penalty,''
Pietrosanti said.
   Members of ``Thou Shalt Not Kill'' met with Cooper for three
hours in her Indiana prison cell this week.
   When Ms. Cooper was sentenced, Indiana law allowed the death
penalty for anyone over the age of 10 convicted of murder. The age
limit has since been raised to 16, but was not made retroactive.
   As of Feb. 1, 27 people awaited execution in the United States
for crimes they committed before reaching age 18. Ms. Cooper and
Troy Dugar of Louisiana are the only condemned prisoners who
committed their crimes before age 16.

<HEAD>Atlanta Mayor Says No Moratorium On Building Contracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Andrew Young ruled out halting new city
building projects Friday in reaction to a Georgia Supreme Court
ruling that voided Atlanta's program to encourage minority-owned
contractors.
   ``We will do what we have to do on a case-by-case basis without
minority regulation,'' Young said. ``I hope we can continue to do
business together.''
   Young, a longtime civil rights leader, cited decades of slavery
and segregation in likening the stricken Atlanta plan to the
Marshall Plan that helped Europe back to its feet after World War II.
   ``We can't help but begin to see that the Reagan legacy has come
home to roost,'' Young said.
   He said the Atlanta program, which set a goal of 35 percent
minority participation in city contracts, had been aimed at ``full
participation'' by all sectors of Atlanta.
   Young said at a news conference there was no need for a
moratorium on contracts because most of the major projects he had
planned in his nearly eight years in office already are under way.
   The Georgia Supreme Court ruled 7-0 Thursday that Atlanta's
Minority-Female Business Enterprise program was unconstitutional and
that the city's defense of the 14-year-old program was ``woefully
inadequate.'' It said there was insufficient evidence of past
discrimination.
   Young said Friday that the guidelines were drawn and implemented
``in the implicit spirit of fairness'' to Atlanta's black majority.
   Young said there would be no appeal to federal courts, but the
city might seek clarifications or modifications at the state level.
   Thursday's ruling followed the U.S. Supreme Court decision in
January to overturn a set-aside program in Richmond, Va.
   ``We never had quotas, we never had set-asides. We simply had
goals,'' Young said. ``We had a flexible approach we felt was quite
different from Richmond.''
   Last year, Atlanta awarded $29.4 million to minority-owned and
operated companies, 36.7 percent of all city contracting business.
More than $300 million in city business has gone to minority
companies since the 35 percent minority participation goal was
established in 1975.
   The court found that the program was too broadly drawn and that
the city failed to consider alternatives to a yearly minority
participation goal in its contracting.
   In overturning an earlier Superior Court ruling that upheld the
program, the Supreme Court indicated that Atlanta could have used
milder measures in its affirmative action efforts but did not fully
explore them.
   The high court's ruling was on behalf of the American
Subcontractors Association, whose attorney, J. Ben Shapiro, praised
the court's decision.
   ``That program is illegal as of right now,'' Shapiro said.
   It was not immediately clear whether the ruling effectively
dismantles the program. Young said city experts needed time to study
the ruling.
   Some city business leaders expressed optimism that Atlanta's
biracial business climate would survive the ruling.
   ``The program allowed us to develop certain relationships,'' said
Tom Cordy, president of AMC Mechanical Contractors, one of the
partners in the construction of the Underground Atlanta
entertainment complex. ``Those relationships will go on. People will
continue to do business as we have.''
   Fulton and DeKalb counties, which include parts of Atlanta, have
goals of 20 percent minority participation in county contracts.
Their programs were not affected by the ruling Thursday, but the
Fulton County program is being challenged in federal court.

<HEAD>City Named For Andropov Gets Back Original Name</HEAD>

   Communist Party officials removed Yuri V.
Andropov's name from a city north of Moscow, Tass said Friday,
making him the latest former leader whose name has been wiped off
Soviet maps.
   Residents of the city 150 miles north of the capital had asked
that Rybinsk assume its original name, the official news agency said.
   A Soviet atlas published in 1986 lists the city by the name of
Rybinsk, with ``Andropov'' in parenthesis.
   Andropov headed the KGB until Leonid I. Brezhnev died in 1982,
when he became Kremlin leader. He was a mentor of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev until his death in 1984, when he was succeeded by
Konstantin U. Chernenko.
   Tass said the Communist Party Central Committee, the Supreme
Soviet Presidium and the Soviet government reversed their 1984
decision naming the city after Andropov.
   Andropov has not been widely attacked in the official media under
Gorbachev.
   In January 1988, a city, squares and a Moscow neighborhood were
stripped of the name Brezhnev, who is now blamed for stagnation and
bloated bureaucracy.
   In December, Kremlin officials ordered the names of Brezhnev and
Chernenko wiped off their homes and any other towns, schools or
factories that still bore their name.
   Associates of former Soviet leader Josef Stalin also have had
their names removed from cities and squares.
   Western diplomats disagreed about whether there is any
significance to the move in a society where place names are being
changed because of political disgrace and also to reinstate more
popular, historic names eliminated without the approval of residents.
   ``It's a major change in the leadership's approach to Andropov,''
said a high-ranking Western diplomat who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``This is the first concrete indication'' that Gorbachev is in
``political trouble'' because he was Andropov's protege, he said.
But he also said the name change also may be part of Gorbachev's
rejection of a cult of personality for former leaders.
   Another Moscow-based Western diplomat said the change could be
part of a general move in the Soviet Union to give back cities their
traditional names. ``I'm surprised if it is a criticism of Andropov
_ it seems rather odd,'' he said.

<HEAD>CBO Puts Cost of Bush Bailout at $360 Billion over 30 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's savings and loan bailout plan
would cost taxpayers more than twice the $40 billion forecast by the
administration over the next 11 years, plus an additional $20
billion if interest rates don't fall sharply, the Congressional
Budget Office estimated Friday.
   Including interest on money Bush would borrow to pay off
depositors in 800 S&amp;Ls already insolvent or near insolvency,
taxpayers will pick up 70 percent of the estimated $360 billion tab
over three decades, acting CBO Director James Blum told the Senate
Banking Committee.
   Blum, however, said that the total bill could go much higher if:
   _Interest rates do not fall dramatically, as the administration
predicts.
   _The number of insolvent institutions grows beyond the 300 dealt
with over the last two years, the 350 that are now insolvent but
still in business and 150 more expected to become insolvent ``in the
next year or so.''
   _Deposit growth in S&amp;Ls doesn't return to the 7 percent annual
rate experienced so far this decade.
   Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., the Banking Committee's chairman,
complained that Bush's rescue package is open-ended with no cap on
what taxpayers eventually might have to pay.
   ``There's a question of honesty in dealing with the American
people,'' he said. ``The mechanism being proposed says we're asking
you to sign a blank check today and we'll fill in the numbers later.
It could be any figure.''
   But Blum said he saw no alternative.
   ``These are losses that have already been incurred by the
government,'' he said, referring to federal guarantees of up to
$100,000 each for covering depositors against losses.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman had told the committee
Thursday that the cost to taxpayers of Bush's proposal would be
$39.9 billion from 1989 through 1999, assuming that interest rates
decline by 5 percentage points over the next five years.
   Darman, however, conceded that taxpayers could be stuck with up
to a $50.6 billion share of the pre-2000 costs of the package if
interest rates are 2 to 3 percentage points higher, as congressional
budget experts predicted they would be.
   Using the optimistic White House expectations on interest rates,
Blum estimated the taxpayer costs of the bailout over the next 11
years at $84 billion, including $16 billion in interest costs to the
Treasury not included in the administration's cost estimates.
   If interest rates fall just 2 to 3 percentage points, instead of
the 5 percentage points predicted by the White House, Blum said,
that would add $20 billion to the estimated $84 billion in costs to
taxpayers by 1999.
   Slower annual deposit growth, in the range of 4 percent to 5
percent instead of the 7 percent assumed in Bush's plan, would add
$5 billion to the tab, he said.
   Altogether, using White House assumptions about interest rates
and deposit growth, the Congressional Budget Office put the total
bailout tab at $205 billion over the next 11 years _ about one-third
higher than administration figures.

   President Augusto Pinochet said the
military committed human rights abuses after seizing power in a 1973
coup, but he blamed the abuses on leftist foes of his authoritarian
government.
   The 73-year-old president and army commander made his surprising
comment during a speech Thursday night in Puerto Varas, 620 miles
south of Santiago.
   The Pinochet government has been accused of widespread human
rights abuses, including torture and killing of hundreds of
dissidents.
   The Roman Catholic church and local and foreign human rights
organizations have documented the cases of at least 700 dissidents
who disappeared after being arrested by security agents.
   Pinochet and other government officials repeatedly denied the
accusations, calling them part of a communist-inspired propaganda
campaign.
   Pinochet's speech was carried Friday by Santiago radio stations,
but pro-government newspapers did not carry the quotes related to
the human rights issue in full.
   ``They accuse us of human rights abuses, they talk about
killings,'' Pinochet said. ``I do not say the contrary, there were
excesses from both sides.''
   He added: ``But who encouraged them? We didn't. They did. It was
their fault.''
   Jaime Castillo, president of Chile's independent Human Rights
Commission, called Pinochet's speech ``positive.''
   But, he added, ``there is a contradiction, when he now admits the
abuses he used to deny, but at the same time blames them on those
who were the victims of such abuses.''
   Pinochet said the armed forces had to act against ``more than
15,000 guerrillas'' when he led the bloody 1973 coup that toppled
the elected government of President Salvador Allende, an avowed
Marxist. Allende died in the takeover.
   Pinochet said that after the coup the military found illegal arms
caches ``big enough to arm 35,000 men.'' He said the country had
been driven ``to the brink of civilian war.''
   After the coup, thousands of leftists were rounded up. Human
rights groups, including the U.N. Human Rights Commission, say many
were tortured, jailed or sent into exile. An unspecified number were
killed. Others were officially reported killed in clashes with
security forces.
   In 1978, the Pinochet government issued an amnesty favoring those
responsible for abuses after the coup. Opposition leaders say they
plan to investigate the abuses after Pinochet steps down next year
and punish ``those found guilty of having committed crimes.''
   Pinochet is due to hand over power March 11, 1990 to the winner
in a presidential election scheduled Dec. 14.

<HEAD>Moslem Army Reinforces Troops in South Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAHRANI, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of Lebanon's Moslem army
units sent about 500 soldiers and 10 aging Soviet-designed tanks
Friday to south Lebanon, where he has said he expects ``an Israeli
operation at any time.''
   The 3,000 Lebanese soldiers already in the south are not equipped
with tanks. they have stayed out of Israel's fight with Palestinian
and Shiite Moslem guerrillas in the area.
   Israel maintains a ``security zone'' just inside Lebanon with the
aid of a predominantly Christian surrogate militia. Its military
command refused comment Friday on the Lebanese troop movements, but
a spokesman said the ``army is doing everything to secure its
northern border.''
   Two Israeli jet fighters flew reconnaissance as the mechanized
battalion moved to Zahrani, 35 miles south of Beirut. Palestinian
and Lebanese militia gunners fired at them but no hits were reported.
   Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib, who commands the Moslem units of the
divided Lebanese army, said in an interview this week he would send
reinforcements south to fight Israel and cooperate with U.N.
peacekeeping troops in the area.
   He said he expected an Israeli operation soon and ``we'll fight
and try to hamper the enemy's advance as much as we can.''
   The soldiers who arrived Friday deployed around the Zahrani oil
refinery, but a Lebanese military spokesman said they and their T-54
tanks would move to Zaghdraya. The inland town, 12 miles from the
Israeli zone, is the army's most forward position in south Lebanon.
   Khatib said Lebanese soldiers would help the U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon enforce Security Council Resolution 425. The resolution,
passed after an Israeli invasion in 1978, calls for the
unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces and deployment of the
5,800-member force along the border.
   UNIFIL, whose area of operations overlaps the buffer zone, has
not been able to move to the border because the Israelis will not
pull back.
   Israel invaded Lebanon again in June 1982 and established the
security zone after withdrawing most of its troops three years later.
   Lebanese soldiers have been caught in crossfire several times but
have not fought a major engagement with Israeli for more than 16
years. The army did not confront the Israelis in either invasion.
   Khatib commands 22,000 soldiers based in Moslem territory south
of Beirut and along the coast, and Gen. Michel Aoun has 20,000
Christian troopers in the Christian area north and east of the
capital.
   The army divided when Moslem militias drove Christian units from
Moslem west Beirut in February 1984, nine years after Lebanon's
sectarian civil war began. Aoun technically commanded the entire
army, however, until a deadlock on the presidential succession
created two governments last fall.
   President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended with no successor
elected because right-wing Christians opposed candidates chosen by
neighboring Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
   Christian and Moslem governments emerged from the crisis, with
the Christian cabinet led by Aoun, a fellow Maronite Catholic chosen
by Gemayel as caretaker prime minister.
   Moslems would not accept Aoun's authority and acting Premier
Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads the Moslem cabinet, named
Khatib commander of Moslem army units.
   By longstanding agreement, Lebanon's president is Christian, the
premier Sunni and the Parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.
   Syria, which has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon, supports Khatib's
command.

<TEXT>
   Political handicappers tried Friday to come up
with an early line after an election canvass sent veteran campaigner
Edward Vrdolyak to the post as the final entry in this city's
three-way mayoral race.
   Vrdolyak, a former alderman who announced himself as a write-in
candidate just six days before Tuesday's mayoral primary, became the
apparent Republican winner after a canvass Thursday by the Chicago
Board of Election Commissioners.
   The canvass showed him with 11,621 votes to 10,478 for Herbert
Sohn, the endorsed GOP candidate, who conceded Friday. The board is
expected to make it official next week.
   The results set up a three-way battle in the April 4 mayoral
election, pitting Vrdolyak against Democratic nominee Richard M.
Daley and independent candidate Timothy Evans. Vrdolyak and Daley
are white and Evans is black.
   Political observers saw Daley as the early favorite, with Evans
second and Vrdolyak third.
   ``Daley will win, but it might be closer than most people
think,'' said Mike Royko, the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and
veteran political observer of the Chicago Tribune.
   ``The thing that's hard to gauge right now is what eventual
impact of Vrdolyak will be on Daley. Both men are white, and
whatever votes he skims off, will come from Daley,'' he said Friday.
``But it won't be enough for Evans.''
   Asked to predict the outcome, Royko said Daley would collect 46
percent of the vote, followed by Evans with 44 percent and Vrdolyak
with 10 percent.
   Four other well-known Chicago political analysts agreed with that
order of finish _ professors Eugene Kennedy of Loyola University and
Paul Kleppner of Northern Illinois University, popular black radio
personality Lu Palmer and Republican official Tom Roesser.
   ``With Daley having won the primary, Tim (Evans) won't have much
of a chance,'' said Palmer. ``The primary winner already has all the
money and more is going to flock to him.
   ``Vrdolyak's not going to have much of an impact. Why should
white voters cross over and vote for Vrdolyak? They've already got
their candidate.''
   Formal polls assessing the candidates' chances have not yet been
released since the three entries in the race were certain.
   Daley, who beat Mayor Eugene Sawyer in the Democratic primary and
moved one step closer to attaining the office held 21 years by his
legendary father, extended his Florida vacation to a third day
Friday.
   His campaign manager, David Axelrod, dismissed Vrdolyak as a
threat, saying, ``He does not strike fear in anyone's heart.''
   Evans, trying to stretch his existing campaign funds and raise
more, scrambled to tape three television shows for weekend broadcast
and scheduled seven appearances around the city. He picked up the
endorsement of the 28,000-member Chicago Teachers Union.
   Vrdolyak, an alderman and Democratic county chairman before
converting to the Republican Party some 18 months ago, appeared on
two talk shows on predominantly black radio stations.
   Some callers criticized Vrdolyak for his staunch City Council
opposition during the tenure of the late Harold Washington, the
city's first black mayor. One suggested Vrdolyak entered the race to
extract a reward from Daley in exchange for dropping out.
   Vrdolyak denied the charge, then added, ``You have the typical
Democratic viewpoint that you can negotiate anything.''

   The army is training special units to deal
exclusively with the Palestinian uprising so that other soldiers can
perform duties elsewhere, the army weekly Bamahane reported in its
latest issue.
   The troops will undergo basic infantry training, followed by
training on armored personnel carriers. They will then take a new
anti-uprising course, the newspaper said.
   If a war broke out, the units would serve as mechanized infantry,
Bamahane said.
   ``Their year will consist of nine months of security duty in the
territories and three months of mechanized infantry training,'' Col.
M, personnel chief of the army's ground forces, was quoted as saying.
   His full name was not released, in keeping with military
regulations.
   Senior army officials have complained that dealing with the
15-month uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has
severely affected the army's training program.
   Many reserve and regular units, instead of training, have been
sent to patrol the occupied territories.
   In addition, the United States alleged last month that Israel's
failure to train professional riot control forces led to an increase
in casualties.
   When the revolt broke out Dec. 8, 1987, soldiers were sent to
deal with stone-throwing demonstrators without helmets, clubs or
sufficient amounts of tear gas.
   Many of the Arab deaths have since been blamed on army reservists
or teen-age recruits inexperienced in civilian riot control. In the
last 15 months, at least 388 Palestinians have been killed.
   During the same time frame, Israeli media say professional police
forces such as the Border Police have not killed a single
Palestinian.
   The new ``Allon units'' _ apparently named ofter Yigal Allon, a
founder of pre-state elite commando units _ came under attack from
both ends of the political spectrum.
   ``Maybe it will bring the casualties down, but the uprising will
not stop,'' said Ran Cohen, a reserve colonel and a legislator of
the leftist Citizens Rights Movement. ``This is part of a very
dangerous process of turning the army and its troops into a colonial
police force.''
   Rafael Eitan, a right-wing Parliament member and former army
chief of staff, called the idea of special units ``rubbish.''
   ``You don't need special units, you have to know how to punish,''
he said.
   ``They think that by changing organization they'll solve the
problem,'' Eitan continued. ``Instead of shooting children, we
should expel their leaders and give missions to the Jewish
settlers.''

<HEAD>Gumbel's Grumble: Scott Ponders Leaving, Pauley Says `Lighten Up'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weatherman Willard Scott says maybe he should
leave the ``Today'' show if he can't reconcile with Bryant Gumbel
over a memo outlining Gumbel's blunt complaints about Scott and
other on-air personalities.
   Gumbel's co-host, Jane Pauley, who wasn't mentioned in the memo,
has suggested that everybody ``lighten up.''
   Earlier this week, New York Newsday featured a front-page story
of the leaked memo, written last August by Gumbel to ``Today''
executive producer Marty Ryan and apparently extracted from Gumbel's
computer file.
   Gumbel complained about Scott, movie reviewer Gene Shalit and
consumer advocate David Horowitz, among others.
   ``This is not a national crisis,'' Pauley told ``Entertainment
Tonight'' in an interview for broadcast Friday night. ``Sure it was
a problem, but every family has it's ups and downs.''
   Gumbel's most critical comments were aimed at Scott for his
alleged ``bad taste.'' ``This guy is killing us,'' Gumbel grumbled.
Gumbel complained that Scott used valuable time on the morning NBC
news show to display T-shirts, souvenirs and photos of elderly
birthday celebrants.
   Gumbel has been on vacation and has not commented on the memo.
   ``If it's not real, and if there isn't an honest, genuine
reconciliation, I don't think I belong there,'' Scott said on
Thursday night's ``Entertainment Tonight.'' Scott and Gumbel won't
be on the set together for at least a week, because Scott is on
vacation next week.
   ``My whole act hangs on working the neighborhood, you know, doing
the T-shirts and plugging the birthdays _ I wasn't aware that he was
unhappy with that,'' Scott said.
   NBC News President Michael Gartner said in a memorandum to staff
members that if he finds who leaked the memo, the person will be
fired.

   An American has been charged by Italian
customs police with trying to export ancient engravings and a fossil
illegally, authorities said Friday.
   Dr. Russell Lewis Coulson of Peoria, Ill., did not try to hide
the objects when he was checked by Italian border police on a train
to Geneva, said police Lt. Col. Umberto Selvaggi.
   ``He did not know that the objects were subject to artistic
protection and could not be taken abroad,'' Selvaggi said.
   Police said the 46-year-old dentist bought the fish fossil and
six engravings dating back to the 15th and 17th centuries in Venice.
Authorities said they did not know the value of the objects.
   Coulson, who was stopped Feb. 25, was charged with trying to
export objects subject to artistic protection, a crime that carries
a maximum penalty of four months in jail and a fine based on the
value of the objects.
   He was allowed to continue his journey and return to the United
States.

<HEAD>Half of Towns Without Mayors Because of Guerrilla Threats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half the country's 262 towns and
cities were without mayors Friday, the result of a terror campaign
by revolutionaries who say municipal chiefs administer U.S. designs.
   ``Fear is human,'' said Armando Calderon Sol, mayor of San
Salvador, in a recent interview with The Associated Press.
   ``They (other mayors) come to me for advice, but I can't ask them
to be cannon fodder. They have their families to think about. I tell
them it's a personal choice.''
   The Interior Ministry says 131 mayors have chosen to resign.
   Some have been replaced by low-profile ``substitutes'' _ usually
a member of the municipal council.
   Most have simply locked their doors, leaving residents no means
of locally registering births and deaths, getting married or
complaining about potholes.
   Marxist-led revolutionaries say mayors are a principal component
of the ``U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency campaign.'' A 9-year-old
civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people.
   El Salvador, a nation of 5 million, is the Western Hemisphere's
biggest recipient of U.S. economic and military aid _ about $1.5
million per day. The rebels say Washington and El Salvador's ruling
class have sought, through elections, to put a democratic veneer on
a state that remains dominated by the military.
   A big chunk of U.S. aid goes to development projects administered
by the Salvadoran government through local authorities.
   Following municipal elections a year ago, the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or FMLN, began threatening mayors and
insisting they announce their resignations.
   The guerrillas have assassinated nine mayors. The most recent
slaying was in the eastern town of Sesori on Nov. 24. During the
last two months of 1988, several municipal chiefs a week were taking
to the air waves and buying newspaper ads to announce their
resignations.
   At first, the guerrillas concentrated on their ``zones of
control'' _ the northern sectors of Chalatenango, Morazan, San
Miguel and Cabanab provinces where they move freely and enjoy
considerable support. But by late last year they were threatening
mayors nationwide.
   Mayor Ricardo de Leon of San Miguel, the nation's third-largest
city, remains in his post despite two threats last month.
   ``I'm not challenging the insurgents to kill me,'' de Leon, of
the rightist Republican National Alliance, said in an interview.
   ``I don't have enemies. I don't even consider the left my enemy,
because serving the people includes serving the left. But the people
gave me this post, and only the people can tell me to leave it,'' he
said.
   De Leon asked the Roman Catholic Church to arrange a meeting with
local guerrilla leaders so he could ask them ``why I am considered a
military target.''
   He's still waiting to be contacted.
   ``Of course I'm afraid. But the support of the people gives me
valor,'' he said.
   The campaign has been condemned by the Christian Democratic
government, the armed forces, and even the Democratic Convergence, a
guerrilla-allied leftist electoral front.
   The rebels, as part of a peace proposal, offered to stop the
campaign if the government postponed presidential elections
scheduled March 19 and met their demands for security and anti-fraud
measures during the vote.
   The government and rebels have not been able to agree on when,
where or how to negotiate on the proposal, which also ecompasses
many other issues.

<HEAD>Recruiting Irregularities Lead Marines To Tell 135 Recruits To Forget
It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marines have told 135 young people who
signed up for the Corps but were not slated to report until later
not to bother showing up, because their recruitments were fraudulent
and they really weren't qualified, a spokesman said.
   Word of their release from the Corps' delayed-entry program
follows the dismissal of 30 recruits last month from boot camp at
Parris Island, S.C.
   All the dismissals stem from the discovery that high school
diplomas were fabricated and criminal and medical records were
disregarded by the Pittsburgh recruiting station, said Corps
spokesman Maj. Robert W. McLean at Parris Island. Investigators
concluded that recruiters signed up young men who weren't qualified
in order to meet their recruitment quotas.
   Records of an additional 20 recruits in the delayed-entry program
are being reviewed, he said Friday.
   McLean said earlier this week that Maj. George A. Eberhart Jr.,
head of the Pittsburgh recruiting station, and 15 of his recruiters
were relieved of duty and that two additional recruiters received
administrative warnings because of the improper recruiting. In all,
there are 47 recruiters assigned to Pittsburgh.
   None of the young men sent home from boot camp or released from
the delayed-entry program faces any disciplinary charges, officials
said.
   The actions follow an investigation triggered by a suburban
Pittsburgh recruit's claim that his recruiter enlisted him even
though he knew the young man had a severe stomach ulcer that should
have disqualified him. The recruit had to be hospitalized while at
boot camp.
   McLean said 30 recruits were sent home from boot camp after a
review of 83 questionable cases. He told The Press on Thursday that
in addition, 135 of nearly 700 recruits in the Corps'
delayed-enlistment program were also released ``over the same
reasons that the others were disqualified for.''
   The delayed-enlistment program allows recruits to commit
themselves to the Corps without reporting to boot camp until up to
six months later.
   Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., said he met with the Marine Corps'
congressional liaison and was told the Marines ``have never
experienced this widespread a problem in their memory'' with
fabricated recruitments.
   ``This is a very high number of recruiters in a relatively small
pool for them all to be involved in what is clearly a serious
violation of rules,'' Walgren said. ``That number suggests they are
under extraordinary pressure to produce, or it's something far
widespread beyond this recruiting station.''
   The head of the Army recruiting battalion in Pittsburgh said
Thursday that a surprise inspection in November found six instances
of possible improper recruiting. Four recruits were recommended for
dismissal and two cases have not been resolved, said Col. Randell
Wilkes.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to CORRECT that Perez not suspending debt payment

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Andres Perez today
said whether Venezuela can continue to make payments on its foreign
debt depends on the success of its austerity program.
   ``The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a name
written with capital letters _ foreign debt,'' Perez told foreign
correspondents at Miraflores Palace, the government headquarters.
   A newspaper today reported more than 300 people died and and
1,500 were injured since Monday in riots in Caracas and 11 other
cities. The unrest was caused by government-imposed bus fare
increases, which appeared to release pent up frustration over the
nation's austerity program.
   Buses and cars circulated in Caracas today as the capital
returned to normal, with early morning traffic jams and honking
horns replacing some of the tensions of this week's unrest.
   Looters emptied the shelves of supermarkets and neighborhood
grocery stores in the first days of rioting. Since then, part of the
22,000 police and soldiers ordered on alert in Caracas have guarded
stores, where people have been waiting hours in line to buy such
staples as eggs, bread and cheese.
   Perez, in a morning news conference, said payments on the
country's $33 million foreign debt depends on ``how our economic
program develops.''
   Venezuela, affluent during the 1970s thanks to its rich oil
reserves, saw its fortunes slide along with petroleum prices in 1981.
   Real wages have since then fallen by a third, inflation is
expected to double this year to 70 percent, and the $33 billion
foreign debt is the fourth largest in Latin America after Brazil,
Mexico and Argentina.
   Venezuela suspended payments on $20.4 billion of the debt in
January, and the newspaper El Nacional reported last week that
payments on another $5 billion of the debt was suspended.
   Earlier this week, the government asked the International
Monetary Fund to include provisions allowing Venezuela to suspend
all payments on its debt until September. Venezuela also asked for
an additional $4.3 billion in loans from the institution over the
next three years.
   Asked if he intended to delay repayment beyond September, Perez
said it would depend on the success of his economic adjustment
program.
   Perez, who has been in office for only one month, has blamed
leftists for prolonging Venezuela's worst unrest in 31 years of
democratic rule.
   On Wednesday, Gabriel Puerta, a former guerrilla leader, accused
the government of inventing political motives for the disturbances,
which he blamed on the failure of the government's economic policies.
   On Thursday evening, soldiers hunting snipers and seeking looters
conducted house-to-house searches in downtown Caracas and the
western slums. Shooting was heard early today as soldiers fired into
the air and at buildings to flush out snipers. It appeared the
gunfire also was meant to enforce the government's dusk-to-dawn
curfew by keeping people off the streets.
   El Nacional said in today's edition that more than 300 people had
been killed and 1,500 injured in four days of violence _ the
bloodiest in Venezuela's history. Other reports said the death toll
ranged from 250 to 350.
   The newspaper said its reporters counted 237 bodies at the
Caracas central morgue and said there were other bodies in hospitals
across the city. The dead included at least four children aged 3 to
14.
   Perez aide Reinaldo Figueredo said the government is setting up a
food-distribution network with supplies airlifted from the rest of
the country.

   The Coast Guard spotted an oil slick off
the northern Florida Keys on Friday, but marine reserve officials
said the two-mile spill apparently was no immediate threat to the
area's popular reefs.
   The slick, of unknown origin, was 10 to 12 miles off the north
Key Largo coast Friday afternoon, said Coast Guard spokesman Joe Dye.
   ``Where it is, it would not be a threat,'' he said. Two or three
dead birds were spotted, but it was not clear if they were killed by
the oil, Dye said.
   Officials of two parks off Key Largo _ the Key Largo National
Marine Reserve and John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park _ sent boats
out to survey the area after spotting some tar balls in the waters.
   ``We have tar balls measuring one-quarter to 4 inches in diameter
that are washing near the southern boundary on the park,'' said
Pennekamp director Carl Nielsen. ``But it is not a big spill. This
is a normal occurrence from ships that pass by, and it won't have a
big effect on the park.''
   The 20-mile-long offshore state park, a favorite among divers,
stretches north from Molasses Point off the Atlantic shore of Key
Largo. The federal Key Largo reserve covers about the same area, but
outside the three-mile limit.
   The slick was first reported to be as large as 10 miles long, 2
miles wide, and as much as 4 feet deep, which would have made it a
major spill.
   But an overflight Friday by a Coast Guard marine safety officer
discovered the spill was only two miles long and a quarter-mile
wide, and in some places was only a light stain.
   The spill could have been bunker oil released by a ship, said
Coast Guard marine safety office spokeswoman Lynn Mountcastle.

   The pilot who landed a jetliner after its
side ripped open, ejecting nine passengers, said Friday that after
the shock he said a quick prayer for his passengers and went back to
work.
   Capt. David Cronin was in charge of United Airlines Flight 811 on
its Feb. 24 non-stop flight from Honolulu to Auckland, New Zealand,
when shortly after takeoff the Boeing 747's right forward cargo door
and an adjoining 10-by-10 foot section of fuselage tore away.
   In addition to the nine people missing, 27 were injured in the
turbulence of the sudden decompression and the flight back to
Honolulu.
   Cronin said the accident outweighed anything he experienced in
the military as a fighter pilot.
   After realizing the extent of damage to the plane, ``I said a
prayer for them (passengers) momentarily and got back to business,''
Cronin said at a news conference held within earshot of jets taking
off and landing at San Francisco International Airport.
   First Officer Al Slader said simulated disaster exercises
undertaken annually by United personnel were important but
insufficient for the many problems that faced them.
   The crew ``reverted almost to survival instincts,'' Slader said.
   The crewmembers' answers were carefully controlled by airline
officials, who prohibited them from answering questions pertaining
to concerns about aging aircraft or the investigation of the
disaster.
   Cronin was on his next-to-last flight, after 38 years of military
and commercial flying and he said he's looking forward to his next _
and final _ flight.
   Because the flight took off through a fierce thunderstorm, he
said he had ordered passengers to keep their seatbelts fastened.
Without that precaution, many more lives would definitely have been
lost, Cronin said.
   After the accident, the crew members said, they reached for
oxygen masks but found the oxygen lines had been severed.
   Cronin said the plane was ``quivering and shuddering'' and he
could see flames from one wing.
   During the 25-minute flight back to Honolulu, the crew had to
dump 90,000 pounds of fuel, partly because with only two engines the
plane was, in effect, overloaded.
   In addition, the gaping hole in the side created drag which
affected speed and control.
   Part of the emergency descent procedure for getting the plane
back down to breathable air is to lower the landing gear to create
drag.
   But Cronin said their decision not to lower the landing gear
probably was critical to keeping the big jet from losing altitude
too quickly before its remaining engines got it back to the Honolulu
runway.
   If they had lowered the wheels immediately, there ``would have
been a good chance we would have gone in the water,'' he said.
   The crew also agreed to gradually move landing flaps to angles
not normally prescribed to keep the plane in the air.
   ``I don't think a 747 has ever flown on two engines at that
weight. My concern for being overweight was staying airborne,'' the
pilot told the Washington Post on Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, Second Officer Mark Thomas said he checked out the
passenger area and saw ``no panic at all'' and that none of the
passengers were moving.
   Normal landing speed with all four engines would have been 132
knots. The crew estimated that 170 knots would be safe. Cronin said
he chose to touch down at 200 knots because he was afraid of losing
control of the jet if he slowed it further.
   Once the plane reached view of Honolulu International, he said he
was confident of the plane's safe landing, which took up two-thirds
of the runway because of their speed and not having reverse thrust
from all four engines.
   ``There was a sigh of relief and we started looking after the
passengers,'' Thomas said.
   After all remaining passengers had unloaded, Cronin said he and
the other two crew members left by way of an emergency chute. They
inspected the damage, which he described as ``a hole you could drive
a semi-truck through.''
   ``My reaction was, I can't tell you what my reaction was, like
`Oh, (pause) you know what. Oh, dear.'''

<HEAD>Rebels Call Boycott of March 19 Presidential Vote</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels on Friday called
for a boycott of the presidential election scheduled for March 19,
saying the vote would aggravate war and poverty.
   The insurgents have proposed postponement of the election until
September. They said if the vote were put off, they would
participate and respect its outcome.
   ``We call on the our people not to vote March 19,'' said the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front on its clandestine radio
station.
   Despite more than five weeks of debate on the guerrilla proposal,
the Christian Democratic government and the insurgents have not been
able to agree on when, where or how to negotiate its possible
implementation.
   A leftist electoral front on Friday accused the government and
the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, of
procrastinating in response to the plan.
   Arena controls the legislature and is favored to win the
presidential election. It is adamantly opposed to postponement of
the vote.
   ``The Christian Democratic Party and Arena are trying to take
advantage of the situation for propagandistic electoral ends, thus
manipulating the people's desire for peace,'' said the leftist
Democratic Convergence.
   It alleged in a communique that the two parties intend to prevent
postponement by stalling until March 19.
   The leftist alliance proposed rescheduling the election July 9.
It also said the government, the FMLN and representatives of the
political parties should meet in Mexico next week to negotiate an
end to the 9-year-old civil war.
   ``The election of March 19 is designed to sustain the war after
the previous five flawed elections have aggravated the original
causes of the conflict,'' said the rebels on Radio Venceremos.
   ``We have proposed to compete in the political sphere, in which
clear and clean results would conciliate the parties in conflict in
light of the inviability of continuing the war,'' they said. ``But
those who have made a living from the war have sought to close the
doors to peace.''
   ``The elections of March 19 will only aggravate hunger and
misery, as they hold out no hope of real solution for the country's
crisis,'' the rebels said.

<HEAD>Cerezo: Ortega ``Doesn't Like Democracy''</HEAD>

   Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo said Friday
political realities are pushing Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
to abandon a ``totalitarian'' blueprint and pursue a democratic
outcome for his country.
   Cerezo, who is here for talks with Bush administration and
congressional leaders, said Ortega ``doesn't like democracy. He's
trying to make a revolution'' through a ``totalitarian'' formula.
   At the same time, he said, Ortega has had to pay attention to the
demands of other Central American presidents that he embrace
democracy, mindful that they would otherwise repudiate him.
   Cerezo spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.
   Based on his discussions here, Cerezo said there are considerable
doubts among Bush administration officials about Ortega's
willingness to comply with the democratic promises he made at the
recent meeting of Central American presidents in El Salvador.
   Cerezo added that he believes these doubts are justified. The
administration, he said, wants more assurances that democracy will
be established in Nicaragua in a time period comparable to that of
the demobilization of the Contras.
   Still, he said, he believes the administration is convinced that
it should emphasize a diplomatic solution in Nicaragua rather than
continuing to attempt to solve problems through military force.
   Ortega spoke after administration and congressional officials
disclosed details of the ``carrot and stick'' approach to Nicaragua
advocated by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The policy includes unspecified rewards for Nicaragua if it
passes certain ``checkpoints'' on the road to democracy.
   Baker made clear to lawmakers that he does not intend to abandon
the Contra rebels, who now are subsisting on U.S. supplies in
Honduran jungle camps along the Nicaraguan border.
   He told congressional officials he would seek to renew the U.S.
aid, which runs out at the end of this month, for a year, according
to some present at the Thursday meetings.
   Aid would continue to flow at current rates _ about $4 million a
month _ and would keep the rebels available as a standby fighting
force until after Nicaragua's national elections, which are being
moved up to early 1990.
   At the Central American summit meeting, the five presidents
agreed to try to draft a plan that would lead to the demobilization
of the Contras in return for open elections in Nicaragua and the
release of most of the 3,300 jailed Contras and former members of
the armed forces who served under the Somoza family dynasty.

   President Bush called Friday for banning the
production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the
century if adequate substitutes can be found.
   His move to protect the world's ozone layer, which shields the
earth from much of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, came
on the heels of a decision Thursday by 12 European countries to
pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on
production, as the world's industrial nations had earlier agreed to
do.
   The United States accounts for about one-third of the production
of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air
conditioners and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer
equipment.
   Richard K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
had sought the stronger administration position on CFCs before he
left Friday for London, where representatives from more than 100
nations are meeting to discuss the ozone-depletion problem.
   In remarks at the National Academy of Sciences to a group of high
school science award winners, Bush said ``recent studies indicate
the 50 percent reduction (of CFCs under existing treaty) may not be
enough.''
   The president said he asked Reilly to join other nations at the
meeting in London to support the call ``for the elimination of CFCs
by the year 2000 provided safe substitutes are available.''
   Reilly, according to administration sources, had strongly
recommended at a White House meeting Thursday that the United States
join its European allies and call for the complete elimination of
CFCs, as opposed to cutting production by 50 percent as required by
current treaty.
   Under the 1987 treaty, the industrial nations are committed to
halving CFC production by the year 2000, but many scientists have
said that such a cutback would not be enough to protect against
serious ozone depletion.
   On Thursday, the 12 nations of the European Economic Community
announced in Brussels, Belgium, that they have agreed to a ban on
the chemical in their countries by the end of the century. Reilly is
known to have wanted to carry a similar commitment with him to the
London conference, which is scheduled to begin Sunday.
   ``We intend to reaffirm the strong position of the United States
about chlorofluorocarbon manufacture and use,'' Reilly said Friday,
adding that ``we intend to maintain our leadership'' in dealing with
the ozone-depletion problem.
   Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it
does not break down at lower altitudes and floats into the
stratosphere, where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseous
veil of ozone that shields against the sun's cancer-causing
ultraviolet rays.
   After scientists detected increasing ozone depletion, the
industrial nations agreed in September 1987 to a pledge of sharp cut
in the production of ozone-depleting chemicals _ primarily CFCs but
also three halon chemicals _ by the end of 1999.
   The treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, including the
United States, Japan, most of Western Europe and Soviet Union. But
it includes a provision that allows additional measures, including a
complete ban, if further ozone damage is found.
   The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an
accelerated phase-out schedule _ which is provided for in the 1987
accord _ at a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, in early May. The
meeting that will begin Sunday in London, attracting representatives
from more than 100 nations, is described as a dress rehearsal for
the Helsinki session.
   According to the World Resources Institute, the United States
produces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. DuPont de
Nemours &amp; Co. the world's largest producer. There were 750 million
pounds of CFCs produced in the United States last year and about the
same amount in Western Europe, according to Dupont.
   Dupont, which accounts for about half of the U.S. production, has
announced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as the
mid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year.
   ``We think in the mid-90s is when we'll see the wide scale
introduction of the alternatives,'' said Catherine Forte, a Dupont
spokeswoman said in a telephone interview. The manufacturers of
packaging for many food containers already have stopped using CFCs
as a blowing agent in the formulation of plastics.
   But industry and EPA officials have acknowledged continuing
problems in developing adequate CFC substitutes for some uses. A
substitute for CFCs used widely as a cleaning solvent for computer
and electrical equipment has been particularly difficult, suggested
industry experts.
   The EPA is still conducting toxicity tests for a number of the
CFC substitutes, said agency spokesman Chris Rice. Ms. Forte at
Dupont also said the substitutes ``are going to be more difficult to
produce than the existing product.''

<HEAD>NATO Outlines Conventional Arms Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO will offer next week to trim key
conventional weapons systems by 5 percent to 10 percent while asking
the Warsaw Pact to make even larger cuts, an alliance source said
Friday.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
proposal for cuts in NATO's main battle tanks, artillery and armored
troop carriers would bring those weapons ``substantially beneath''
current levels.
   ``Since we are convinced that we ... (are) pretty much at the
minimum of our defense this means for our military people a
significant sacrifice,'' said the source, who outlined the plan to
reporters at NATO headquarters.
   The plan also calls for Warsaw Pact nations to slash by more than
half their main battle tanks and artillery.
   The Western alliance contends the Soviets and their allies have
built up a huge superiority in conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons
in Europe. The alliance wants the East bloc nations to make much
greater reductions in their forces to bring the two sides to rough
equality.
   The proposal will be made Thursday when negotiators for the 16
alliance nations and the seven Warsaw Pact nations begin talks in
Vienna on reducing conventional forces in Europe. The discussions
will cover weapons in the vast region extending from the Atlantic
Ocean to the Ural mountains in the Soviet Union.
   The source said main battle tanks, armored troop carriers and
artillery were singled out for initial discussion because they can
be used in a surprise attack.
   He would only say NATO was prepared to reduce its holdings in
tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers to 90 percent to 95
percent of current levels. The reduction, he said, ranges roughly
between 5 percent to 10 percent.
   Under the NATO formula, an overall ceiling will be set of 40,000
main battle tanks _ 20,000 for each side. NATO said in a report last
year that it has 16,424 such tanks in active units and an additional
5,800 in storage. It estimated the Warsaw Pact total at 51,500 with
more than NATO's in storage.
   The Warsaw Pact, in a recent count, put its tank total at 59,470
and NATO's at 30,690.
   For artillery pieces, NATO will propose an overall cap of 33,000,
or 16,500 for each side, according to the source.
   NATO estimated its artillery, which includes mortars and multiple
rocket launchers, at 14,458 pieces plus an additional 2,870 held in
storage. It estimated the East bloc's at 43,400 with more pieces in
storage than that held by the West.
   The Warsaw Pact count put its artillery at 71,560 pieces compared
to 57,060 for the West.
   On armored troop carriers, the source said the alliance will
suggest an overall limit of 55,000, or 27,500 for each side.
   It was unclear, though, how that would affect the actual count
because neither NATO nor the Warsaw Pact has provided breakdowns for
those forces.
   The NATO report said it has 4,153 armored infantry fighting
vehicles plus 575 in storage, and that the Warsaw Pact has 22,400
with additional ones in storage. It also said the alliance has
35,351 other armored vehicles, including armored personnel carriers,
and the Warsaw Pact has 71,000.
   The Warsaw Pact counts 70,330 infantry vehicles and armored
personnel carriers for the East and 46,900 for the West.

<HEAD>Britain Sentences Czechoslovak Spy To 10 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Czechoslovak spy arrested last year while
receiving secret radio messages from Prague was convicted of
espionage on Friday and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Erwin van Haarlem, 43, whose real identity is still not known to
police, posed as a Dutch art dealer and infiltrated Jewish groups
while sending information back to his superiors, said the
prosecution.
   It said he was an active agent here for 13 years.
   Van Haarlem pleaded innocent and was convicted by a jury after a
five-day trial at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court.
   Judge Simon Brown recommended he be deported after serving his
sentence.
   ``I have not the least doubt that you are a dedicated,
disciplined and resourceful spy,'' Brown said.
   Van Haarlem was recording a coded message when arrested at his
north London apartment on April 2, 1988, by police from Scotland
Yard's special branch.
   Police seized six decoding guides hidden in a bar of soap,
materials for ``secret writing'' and a list of locations for
depositing and collecting material.
   Prosecutor Roy Amlot told the jury that van Haarlem received 210
coded messages from Prague after arriving in Britain in 1975.
   Among his assignments was to find out what firms were
participating in proposed ``Star Wars'' U.S. space-based defense
system, Amlot said.
   Van Haarlem joined Jewish organizations such as Conscience, a
group devoted to helping Soviet Jews, and the Women's Campaign for
Soviet Jewry.
   After his arrest, van Haarlem was taken to a police station where
he asked for a message to be relayed to the Czechoslovak Embassy:
``Erwin van Haarlem has been arrested,'' said Amlot. This was done.
   The jury was told van Haarlem adopted the name of a Dutch child
left by his mother in Prague after World War II. Amlot said the real
van Haarlem's mother searched for and found the Czechoslovak spy in
London, and he pretended he was her son. Tests determined he could
not have been her child, and she was told this. It was not clear
what happened to the real van Haarlem.

   Officials on Friday said a West German
computer spy ring that sold stolen data to the Soviets represents a
new and dangerous dimension in international espionage.
   ``The illegal entry into hundreds of data systems is an extremely
dangerous new threat,'' federal Interior Minister Friedrich
Zimmermann said.
   ``Governments and businesses must now become extremely
vigilant,'' Zimmermann said a day after officials said they had
penetrated a ring of ``hackers'' who sold thousands of passwords and
codes from military and research computers in the United States,
Western Europe and Japan to Soviet intelligence agents.
   Zimmermann, whose ministry is responsible for counterespionage
and domestic intelligence-gathering, called the hackers' operations
``a new dimension of Soviet bloc spy agencies.''
   Although he said it was too soon to assess the full extent of the
damage, he added the investigation had ``succeeded in dealing a
major blow against the KGB Soviet secret service.''
   Juergen Schmid, a spokesman for the federal Justice Ministry,
called the incident ``extremely serious, but not drastic.''
   ``The hackers were able to gain entry, but failed to penetrate
deep into the secret areas of the databanks,'' he said.
   Security officials Friday said three men were in custody and
another five were under investigation.
   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the federal Prosecutor's
Office, said the suspects range in age from 25 to 35.
   He said several were involved with illegal drugs, but did not
elaborate.
   Prechtel said police in Hanover arrested two hackers on
``suspicion of espionage activities for an Eastern European
intelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin,
he said.
   Officials of the federal Criminal Investigation Office in
Wiesbaden said more than 100 state officers and federal agents were
involved in making the arrests and in subsequent searches of
apartments in West Berlin, Hanover and Hamburg.
   A West German broadcast network, Norddeutsche Rundfunk, said
Thursday the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included
the U.S. Defense Department's general databank, known as Optimus; a
NASA and a Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,'' research
computer; and computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.
   The network said attempts were made to gain access to the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, which
it called a key link in efforts to break into other U.S. computers.
   Clifford Stoll, an astrophysicist who did research at the
laboratory, said up to 50 military computers were broken into
through an astronomy computer, but that the hacker did not have
passwords for classified information.
   ``We were amazed. Here's some guy breaking into an astronomy
computer in Berkeley, reaching out into military computers trying to
search for information about SDI, about nuclear warheads,'' Stoll
said in an interview Thursday from his home in Cambridge, Mass.
   Stoll, who works at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at
Harvard University, said he and other researchers helped break the
spy ring. He said someone linked to East bloc groups wrote the lab
asking for related information, leading authorities to the hackers.
   William Bardeen, head of the theory group at Fermilab in Batavia,
Ill., said Soviets participate in research there.
   ``So there are Soviet scientists living at Fermilab and using the
computers. There isn't anything confidential or strategic in the
computers,'' Bardeen said.
   Jeff Schwartz, spokesman for Los Alamos National Laboratory, said
he knew of no evidence a foreign intelligence agency had gained
access to its classified computer system. He said none of the lab's
findings were secret.
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said the three suspects were detained
following searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin and
Hanover.
   According to Norddeutsche Rundfunk, authorities believe the three
hackers were recruited by the KGB in 1985 and ``were paid with cash
and drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes and
passwords to the Soviets.''
   The network said the three handed over information from the
United States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West
Germany at a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East Berlin.
   The hackers obtained information that would allow the Soviets
themselves to gain access to the computers and develop technology
based on the information, the network said.
   The information would also give the Kremlin access to U.S.
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to
several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace
research, the network said.
   Officials at the European Laboratory of Particle Physics in
Geneva said attempts were made in 1986 and 1987 to gain access to
the lab's computers. A laboratory offical, who asked not to be
identified, said Soviet and other specialists have been visiting
researchers at the facility for years.
   In Brussels, European Economic Community officials said the West
German hackers had penetrated a European Space Agency computer in
Paris.
   Willy Helin, a spokesman for the EEC's Research and
Telecommunications Commission, said specialists are trying to
determine whether suspected Soviet agents had also gained access to
other EEC computer networks.
   In Tokyo, a lab official said unknown West German hackers broke
into a computer system in a Japanese government research lab in 1985.
   The National Laboratory For High Energy Physics discovered that a
research project was penetrated in mid-1985, said lab spokesman
Shinichi Watanabe. He said no sensitive information was stolen, and
the lab has since heightened security by changing passwords and
other measures.
   He said it was not known if the intruders were part of the
alleged West German ring.

   Czechoslovakia's Charter 77 human rights
movement has nominated jailed Czech playwright Vaclav Havel for the
1989 Nobel Peace Prize, an emigre source said Friday.
   The announcement came one day after 2,000 Hungarians said they
would nominate Havel for the prize during a demonstration in
Budapest seeking his freedom. Last month, two U.S. congressmen had
nominated the playwright, whose works are banned in his own country,
for the prize.
   The London-based publisher Palach Press, which monitors events in
Czechoslovakia, said a Charter 77 committee would submit the
organization's nomination to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo.
   The committee is made up of Czechoslovak activists, mainly
intellectuals, in a bid to publicize the imprisoned dramatist's case
and gain support for his nomination for the prestigious prize,
Palach Press said.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and U.S. Rep. Steny H. Hoyer,
D-Md., also nominated Havel on Feb. 1 on behalf of the Helsinki
Commission, a human rights monitoring group.
   Havel, 52, was convicted last month on charges of incitement and
obstructing police for his role in a January rally in Prague, and he
was sentenced to nine months in jail. The January rally honored Jan
Palach, a student who set himself afire to protest the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   Havel, who has appealed his sentence, had previously spent
slightly more than four years in jail for his rights campaign.
   A translation of the Feb. 26 letter, made available to The
Associated Press in Vienna by Palach Press, reads:
   ``We therefore believe that the Nobel Peace Prize should be
awarded primarily to those who, working outside their own profession
and often with great personal sacrifice, contribute toward making
life on this planet more just and respectable.''
   Sources linked to the Oslo committee told The Associated Press
that several proposals exist for Havel's nomination. He is one of
nearly 100 candidates, including several organizations.
   The announcement of the prize usually comes in September or
October.

   John Tower could be the first Cabinet nominee
ever to stand on the Senate floor to answer questions from senators
face-to-face, an ordeal that reporters were known to undergo during
the 19th century.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole suggested the extraordinary
appearance Friday to give the embattled nominee for Defense
Secretary a chance to answer charges and questions about his
personal life. Democratic leaders said they would consider any
request.
   Associate Senate Historian Don Ritchie said no one has been
called to the Senate floor for questioning in more than 50 years,
and only five times that are listed in Senate records.
   Leaks of secret material to reporters were the target of early
grillings on the Senate floor and would be again if Dole gets his
way. Dole suggested Friday that Tower needed a chance to rebut the
allegations about his personal life that the Republican leader said
were based on biased leaks from the FBI report on Tower.
   The first recorded target of Senate questioning was William
Duane, editor of the Philadelphia Aurora newspaper. Ritchie said
that Duane had written stories about secret Senate deliberations on
changing the way electoral ballots were counted, stories based on
leaks from senators.
   But Ritchie said Duane left the chamber to talk to his lawyer,
fled the Capitol and never returned.
   Then in 1848 John Nugent of the New York Herald was questioned
about stories on secret Senate deliberations over a treaty. Thirteen
years later, Zebulon White and Hiram Ramsdale of the New York
Tribune were hauled before the senators, again to be asked about
leaks of secret treaty deliberations.
   ``No one revealed their sources,'' said Ritchie, adding that each
of the three reporters was held hostage in Senate committee rooms to
encourage them to cooperate.
   A more recent example _ cited by Dole _ came in 1933, when the
Senate Sergeant-at-Arms David Barry wrote a newspaper article some
members found objectionable. ``Not all senators are crooks,'' Barry
wrote, ``Just some of them.''
   The Senate historian said that Barry was questioned on the Senate
floor that February, grilled later by a Senate committee and then
fired.
   Then in 1934, three airline officials were called to answer
questions about government contracts with airmail carriers.
   As a former senator, Tower has the right to come to the floor of
the Senate, but does not normally have permission to speak to his
one-time colleagues.
   Non-senators have spoken on the Senate floor on other occasions,
including lawyers defending those charged in impeachment proceedings.
   The Senate can, of course, allow anyone to speak to them by
voting to do so.

   Former national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane was given a suspended sentence and fined $20,000 Friday
for misleading Congress with assurances that Oliver L. North was
obeying its ban on helping the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The former Marine lieutenant colonel became the first Iran-Contra
figure to be punished for his role in the affair. He was sentenced
by U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. for his guilty pleas
to four misdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congress.
   Robinson suspended imposition of any prison term and instead
placed McFarlane on two years probation and ordered him to perform
200 hours of community service during that time. McFarlane could
have received a maximum prison term of four years and a $400,000
fine.
   Robinson imposed the sentence and fine with little comment after
McFarlane's attorney, Leonard Garment, called his client ``an
honorable man.''
   ``The public servants in this country are not to be found to be
more decent and more honorable,'' Garment told the judge. ``Every
action on his part .... was taken out of a high sense of duty, a
strong sense of serving his country's interests.''
   ``He stood up and rendered a faithful accounting of his public
responsibilities when called upon to do so,'' Garment said,
referring to McFarlane's admission in court that he misled Congress
about the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``Mr. McFarlane and his family have suffered greatly and enough
during these past years,'' Garment said, referring to the emotional
trauma McFarlane experienced that culiminated in a suicide attempt
several months after the affair was made public.
   Urging probation, Garment said: ``If ever there were a case that
called for this act of discretion, this such a case.''
   McFarlane, in his characteristic emotionless monotone, told
Robinson that ``Clearly, this episode in our history has rendered
enormous turmoil on our country's processes.''
   ``To the extent that I contributed to that I regret it,''
McFarlane said of his role in the Iran-Contra affair. ``I tried to
serve my country.''
   The judge did not elaborate on the reason for his sentence,
except to say that ``the nature of the offense and the totality of
the circumstances'' required him to impose a $5,000 fine for each of
the four counts.
   Robinson said he would make further recommendations about the
type of community service he wants McFarlane to complete during the
two years of probation.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh did not oppose Garment's
request for a suspended sentence. Outside the U.S. Courthouse, Walsh
told reporters his office ``made no recommendation'' on the sentence
and declined further comment.
   As he left the courthouse, McFarlane said he has ``strong faith
and a terrific wife and a free country. I am looking to the future.
That's all I have to say.''
   He had looked tense as he entered the courtroom, walking hand in
hand with his wife, Jonda.
   Robinson said he had carefully read the extensive submissions,
including a statement by McFarlane, that were filed with him but
which weren't on the public record.
   The sentencing occurred in the same courthouse where North,
McFarlane's former aide, is standing trial on 12 felony counts
arising from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
   McFarlane is expected to be a key prosecution witness against
North and had asked to be sentenced by Robinson before he testifies
in the Iran-Contra trial.
   On March 11, 1988, McFarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor
counts of withholding information from Congress and agreed to
cooperate with Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   McFarlane admitted writing three letters in 1985 assuring two
House committees that North was not helping raise money for the
Nicaraguan Contras or providing military assistance in defiance of a
ban on such aid that was imposed by Congress.
   McFarlane admitted to a fourth count of misleading the House
Foreign Affairs Committee on Dec. 8, 1986 by denying any knowledge
of efforts to solicit money from foreign countries to help the
Contras after Congress cut off U.S. military aid.
   Among the 12 felony charges against North are allegations that he
drafted the three 1985 letters for McFarlane's signature that were
sent to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs.
   In opening statements at North's trial on Feb. 22, defense lawyer
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. complained that the former National Security
Council aide ``is charged with crimes for letters that his boss
sent.''
   ``McFarlane decided to write them, but the government wants you
to convict Oliver L. North for them,'' Sullivan said, suggesting
that McFarlane faces tough cross-examination when he testifies
against North.
   Prosecutor John W. Keker told jurors in his opening statement
that McFarlane ``is still reluctant to take the responsibility for
what happened'' and ``is going to blame Oliver North for lying to
him.''
   Each of the four misdemeanor charges that McFarlane pleaded
guilty to carried a maximum one-year prison term and a fine of up to
$100,000.
   The two letters that McFarlane wrote to the House intelligence
committee on Sept. 5, 1985 and Oct. 7, 1985, were in response to the
panel's inquiries about news reports that North was helping raise
money for the Contras and providing military advice.
   In one letter, McFarlane wrote: ``I can state with deep personal
conviction that at no time did I or any member of the National
Security Council staff violate the letter or the spirit of the law.''
   ``We did not solicit funds or other support for military or
paramilitary activities either from Americans or third parties,'' he
wrote.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the intelligence committee's former
chairman, testified as the first witness in North's trial, telling
jurors that he relied on the information that McFarlane gave him.
   ``I certainly relied upon the information given to me by the
national security adviser of the president,'' Hamilton testified.
``I thought that information was accurate, honest and correct,'' he
said.
   McFarlane, who tried to commit suicide in 1987 by taking an
overdose of a tranquilizer, played a major role in the Iran-Contra
affair after resigning as Reagan's national security adviser in late
1985. He led a secret mission to Tehran in 1986 in an unsuccessful
attempt to trade weapons for U.S. hostages. McFarlane, who
accompanied North on the mission, carried a key-shaped cake and a
Bible signed by President Reagan.
   He also testified without immunity from prosecution during the
televised congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair in 1987.

<HEAD>Students Take Over Auditorium Stage to Protest Choice of Atwater

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 students, protesting the selection
of Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater as a trustee of Howard
University, took over an auditorium stage Friday, forcing officials
to move a convocation including presentation of an honorary degree
to comedian Bill Cosby.
   Cosby was a scheduled speaker at a ceremony marking the founding
of the predominantly black university 122 years ago. But students
carrying signs demonstrated outside the auditorium, streamed inside,
chanted and took over the stage.
   Others occupied an administration building for several hours, and
some blocked reporters from entering.
   Police reported no arrests.
   The convocation was moved to an art gallery where there was a
brief ceremony to give Cosby an honorary degree before he left the
campus.
   ``The students at Howard University have a tradition of being
activists,'' university spokesman Alan Hermesch said later. ``When
they feel stongly about issues, they demonstrate.''
   University President James Cheek met with students who flocked to
a convocation luncheon, and promised to meet with several
representatives Saturday to discuss their grievances, Hermesch said.
   The students said their main complaint was the school's decision
last month to name Atwater to its board of trustees.
   Their comments indicated they identified Atwater with
controversial ads, during George Bush's presidential campaign last
year, featuring Willie Horton, a murderer who attacked a Maryland
couple while he was on furlough from a Massachusetts prison.
   The Horton issue contributed ``to the rising anti-black sentiment
of the American people,'' said Michael Lewis, a spokesman for a
group of students who organized the protest, ``and we feel that
facilitated the election of former (Ku Klux) Klansman David Duke to
the Louisiana state Legislature'' recently.
   ``We've been down this road before,'' said Mark Goodin, a
spokesman for Atwater. ``The prison furlough issue has been explored
ad nauseam,'' he said. ``That was not racially motivated whatsoever.
It was simply an issue that was explored because of the peculiarity
of the institution in Massachusetts,'' he added.

<HEAD>Snow Storm Moves Into Nation's Midsection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A winter storm that had blitzed the Northwest with up to 18
inches of snow moved across the Rockies and toward the nation's
midsection Friday, dumping heavy snow on Colorado and Minnesota.
   Snowfall totals in Colorado ranged up to 16 inches at Steamboat
Lake, and in the upper Mississippi Valley, up to 9 inches of snow
blanketed southwestern Minnesota.
   Snow advisories were in effect for the mountains of Iowa, and
winter storm warnings issued for the southern and central mountains
of Colorado, the southern mountains of Wyoming, northern Iowa, and
much of Nebraska, Wisconsin and Michigan.
   Temperatures were in the single digits or below zero from the
northern half of the high Plains to upper Michigan and northern
Minnesota at midday. Strong and gusty winds in the central high
Plains were expected to cause near-blizzard conditions Friday night
and Saturday and produce wind chill readings to 40 degrees below
zero.
   Heavier snowfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
EST included 5 inches at Milwaukee, 4 inches at Green Bay and 3
inches at Madison, Wis.
   Sleet and freezing rain fell from eastern Nebraska to
southwestern Michigan, changing to rain from northeast Oklahoma to
central Illinois. Rain also fell over much of the Southern Atlantic
states.
   Arctic air settled into the northwestern United States in the
wake of the snowstorm. Temperatures dipped well below freezing
across the Pacific Northwest. Astoria, Klamath Falls and Portland,
Ore., had record low temperatures for the date, with readings of 25,
10 and 19 degrees, respectively.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 9 below
zero at Cutbank, Mont., to 84 degrees at Miami and St. Petersburg,
Fla. The morning low for the nation was minus 26 at Warroad, Minn.
   Saturday's forecast called for snow from the southern and central
Rockies to the upper Great Lakes, turning to rain farther south and
east. Scattered thunderstorms were expected from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the southern Appalachians. Fair to partly
sunny skies should prevail elsewhere.
   Highs should be below freezing from the northern and central high
Plains and northwest Texas, most of Michigan and northern Maine,
dipping into the teens from Nebraska and the Dakotas to Minnesota.
Highs above 50 were forecast from western Oregon through California
and western Nevada to southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico,
the Rio Grande Valley the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the central
Gulf Coast states, warming into the 70s and 80s in southern
California, southwestern Arizona, south-central Texas, Florida,
Georgia and South Carolina.

   A storm dumped up to a foot of blowing, drifting snow on the
upper Midwest on Friday, closing scores of schools and snarling
highways, and freezing rain stymied airport traffic and downed power
lines and a radio station tower.
   Winter storm warnings were posted over much of Utah, northwestern
New Mexico, southwestern Colorado, south-central Wyoming, much of
South Dakota, most of Minnesota, and parts of Iowa, Wisconsin, and
Michigan.
   In the Rockies, 16 inches of snow fell overnight at Steamboat
Lake, Colo.
   In the Northwest, record cold hit a day after a record snowstorm
blamed for four deaths that dumped up to 14 inches of snow in
Washington's Puget Sound area. Seattle-Tacoma, Wash., hit a record
low of 24 degrees, Portland, Ore., hit 29 and Astoria, Ore., had a
record 24, the National Weather Service said.
   Drifting snow closed a section of Interstate 15 in central Utah
for about an hour during the morning rush and the Utah Highway
Patrol was so busy with reports of fender-benders it could not
provide an estimate on the number of accidents.
   A foot of snow fell by midday at Worthington, Minn., with 1 to 3
inches over most of the rest of the southern part of the state, the
weather service said. Two traffic deaths were blamed on the snow.
   ``Traffic is very slow and it's slippery in spots,'' Minnesota
State Patrol Trooper Everett Hurd said of conditions in
Minneapolis-St. Paul.
   South Dakota authorities reported 10 inches of snow in the Eagle
Butte area in the northwestern part of the state, with 6 to 8 inches
elsewhere. The snow started falling Thursday and Sioux Falls, in the
state's southeast corner, had 6{ inches by Thursday night.
   ``People are wanting this snow, farmers especially, so we're
giving them what they want,'' meteorologist Chris Jansen said.
   After several years of drought, the mountain snowpack in Montana
was near normal for the first time in seven years after the storm
dumped more than a foot of snow in places, officials say.
   The weather service said Helena and Great Falls already have
exceeded their average annual snowfall, with Helena recording 60
inches and Great Falls 70.3 inches.
   ``Things are looking pretty good this year,'' said Phil Farnes,
snow survey supervisor for the Soil Conservation Service.
``Statewide we area between 80 to 95 percent of our average.''
   Northern Iowa got 2 to 6 inches, with northerly wind causing
drifting.
   West Union, Iowa, School Superintendent Donald Mueller said he
canceled classes for fear that buses might get stuck. ``We had light
snow at 5 o'clock but it has turned to what I'd call heavy with 20-,
30-mile per hour winds,'' he said.
   Radio station WCCO in Minneapolis, which regularly broadcasts
school closing announcements, reported it counted more than 180
schools idled by the storm in southwestern and southern Minnesota.
   Up to 5 inches of snow accumulated in western Nebraska and
freezing rain glazed roads in the east, closing dozens of schools.
Omaha Metropolitan Area Transit buses started limited service more
than three hours late because of icy roads, the city's Eppley
Airfield was closed and garbage pickup was suspended.
   Freezing drizzle knocked out power lines in several areas of
northwest Kansas, and more than 300 utility poles were down in
Sherman County. There was no estimate on the number of affected
customers.
   At Oberlin, Kan., KFNF-FM's 420-foot broadcast tower collapsed
under the weight of ice from two days of freezing rain.
   ``At 8:30 I heard what sounded like pieces of ice breaking off
and hitting the roof. It kept getting louder and louder and ended up
sounding like a freight train,'' said KFNF operations manager Jan
Bainter, who was alone in the studio at the time.
   Herb Deremer, general manager and part owner of KFNF, said it
would be at least a week before the station would be back on the air.
   Freezing rain also extended into Illinois. Chicago's O'Hare and
Midway airports remained open, but flight delays averaged about an
hour, the city's aviation department said.

<HEAD>Rebels Blamed for Butchering 39 Peasants in Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shining Path guerrillas executed 37 men in
a peasant village by cutting their throats, and shot to death a
mother and her baby when the woman tried to flee, a military
official said Friday.
   The attack Monday in a remote village was one of the bloodiest
since the Shining Path launched its insurgency in Ayacucho state in
May 1980.
   In a related matter, the government Friday prolonged for two
months anti-rebel emergency measures in Lima and parts of seven
states where more than half of Peru's 21 million people live.
   The measures suspend constitutional guarantees to travel and meet
freely. They also permit government forces to conduct searches
without a warrant and detain suspects for up to two weeks without
filing charges.
   About 200 rebels in seven boats seized Canaire, a mountain hamlet
located on the Apurimac River 55 miles east of Ayacucho.
   The rebels surrounded villagers who had assembled in the central
plaza, executed 37 men and shot to death a woman and her 9-month-old
baby when she tried to flee, the official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
violence was a revenge attack by the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla
group.
   At the military's urging, Canaire had formed a peasant patrol
against Shining Path attacks and members were gathering in the
village plaza to make rounds when the guerrillas arrived, the
official said.
   Many of the attackers wore army and police uniforms and took the
peasants by surprise, he said.
   Villagers were confined in the village church after the
executions, which they were forced to witness, he said.
   Since 1980 both rebels and the military have been accused of
slaughtering peasant farmers in Peru's Andes Mountains, mainly in
impoverished Ayacucho state.
   In the largest massacre on record, guerrillas killed 87 peasants
in 1983 in the village of Lucanamarca. In 1985, troops slaughtered
69 villagers in Accomarca.
   The Shining Path has systematically attacked villages that have
organized peasant patrols under military orders to defend themselves
against the rebels.
   Most peasant patrols are poorly armed with lances, slings and
shotguns.
   The central and southern Andean highlands are populated by
Quechua-speaking Indians who live in isolated hamlets.
   Ayacucho, the capital of Ayacucho state, is located 235 miles
southeast of Lima. The region is the cradle of the Shining Path
fight, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives.
   A state of emergency was first declared in Ayacucho in late 1982,
and the measure has been prolonged periodically since. Other regions
in the central highlands, the Pacific coast and the Amazon jungle
were later declared emergency zones as insurgency spread.

<HEAD>Stations Yank Cat Stevens Songs Over Singer's Support of Rushdie
Death Threat</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Satanic Verses, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>

   Radio stations nationwide are boycotting Cat
Stevens songs because the 1970s balladeer said he supported
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's murder threat against ``Satanic
Verses'' author Salman Rushdie.
   The former pop star, however, denied Friday that he wants to see
the writer killed. He said he was ``totally abhorred'' by press
publicity and headlines such as, ``Kill Rushdie says Cat Stevens.''
   Stevens, a Briton who took the name Yusuf Islam and founded an
Islamic school in London when he became a Moslem in 1977, said he
had ``simply stated the Islamic ruling on the Rushdie affair'' when
he was asked a question at Kingston Polytechnic, a college near
London, on Feb. 21.
   He said in a statement issued in London that his only fault was
``being honest.'' He also said the novel ``insults God and His
prophets, including those prophets honored by Christians and Jews as
well as Moslems.''
   Stations such as KZPS-FM in Dallas, WCXR-FM in Washington, D.C.,
WEBE-FM in Westport, Conn., WBZY-AM in New Castle, Pa., and KLSX-FM
in Los Angeles have dropped Cat Stevens records from their
programming.
   In Detroit, WRIF-FM promoted a ``No Cat Stevens Weekend'' by
cutting into his songs with explosions or the sound of someone
punching someone ``right after a very optimistic and non-violent
line of dialogue,'' program director Marty Bender said Friday.
   ``We're doing the `No Cat Stevens Weekend' to make a point about
one human being advocating the death of another. ... This guy
carries a lot of weight, a lot of people grew up listening to his
stuff,'' Bender said.
   The tempest stems from Stevens' remarks to Moslem students in
England last week in which he endorsed Khomeini's call to kill
Rushdie for writing the novel that many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   ``The Koran makes it clear: If someone defames the prophet, then
he must die,'' the singer-turned-teacher told the students.
   Stevens was a leading singer-songwriter of the 1970s, with such
hits as ``Moon Shadow,'' ``Peace Train'' and ``Wild World'' in 1971,
``Morning Has Broken'' in 1972 and ``Another Saturday Night'' in
1974.
   But he abandoned his career and stage name years ago.
   Stevens said Friday that it is the duty of every Moslem to put
forward the Islamic viewpoint ``and that is what I did.''
   ``My only crime was, I suppose, in being honest. I stood up and
expressed my belief and I am in no way apologizing for it,'' Stevens
said in a statement.
   Stevens' statement was headed in black type: ``Under Islamic Law,
the ruling regarding blasphemy is quite clear; the person found
guilty of it must be put to death. Only under certain circumstances
can repentance be accepted.''
   Stevens said Moslems in Britain must observe British laws, but
might have to become more involved in British politics if the
government would not comply with their demands for a ban on
Rushdie's novel.
   Bender, who estimates WRIF only played Cat Stevens songs once or
twice a week, readily admits `we're just goofing around'' and he
believes much of the fuss on the nation's airwaves has its roots in
promotion.
   ``It's more ploy than politics,'' he said.
   In Nashville, disc jockeys at WGFX-FM dropped the singer's works
and offered to swap their recordings for copies of ``Satanic
Verses.''
   Radio personality Tom Leykis of KFI-AM in Los Angeles asked
people to bring in records to burn, only to have that denounced by
colleague Geoff Edwards, who was suspended Feb. 28 for refusing to
run Leykis' promotions.
   KFI publicist Mike Venema said a station announcement on the
resolution of that conflict was pending. However, a bonfire
scheduled for March 8 was canceled because the Fire Department
revoked a permit it had granted, Venema said.
   Leykis said in a press release he would still destroy the
records, perhaps by steamroller, but as an alternative he was trying
to organize a celebrity concert protesting the death threat against
Rushdie.
   A spokesman for WCXR in the nation's capital emphasized that the
station pulled the records off the air Feb. 28 after serious
discussion of listeners' complaints that they felt uncomfortable
hearing Cat Stevens.
   ``We didn't do this to generate publicity or to scream our call
letters out,'' said promotion director Mark Lapidus, calling the
indefinite suspension of Cat Stevens airplay a response to
listeners' requests.

<TEXT>
   The White House, trying to save a Utah
snake-venom researcher who was bitten by a rare snake, searched
remote corners of the globe for serum and then used U.S. government
contacts Friday to speed the medicine to his bedside.
   Two badly needed serums were located in out-of-the way parts of
Iran and the Soviet Union, and with the White House getting the
Customs Service to waive normal clearance rules, were en route to
Salt Lake City late Friday.
   William Haast, director of Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the
University of Utah's Research Park, maintains 1,000 exotic,
poisonous snakes at the lab, which provides venom to health
organizations and others for research and use in manufacturing
anti-venins.
   The 78-year-old man had been bitten nearly 150 times previously,
and he thought he had built up immunity. Haast evidently did not
initially consider Thursday's bite by a Pakistani pit viper to be
serious.
   But he became ill and was in serious condition Friday at the
University of Utah Health Sciences Center, awaiting the rare serums
that could give him a full recovery.
   He already has been treated with massive doses of antivenin,
including a shipment the Utah hospital obtained through an unusual
airport relay involving a California zoo, a helicopter and a Delta
Air Lines jetliner.
   Stephen Studdert, a special assistant to President Bush, said he
got a call Thursday night from an associate of Haast.
   Studdert, who is from Salt Lake City, had given a speech there
recently describing Bush's ``kinder, gentler'' approach to human
problems. An associate of Haast read an account of his speech,
Studdert said, and called for help Thursday night.
   Studdert said the White House switchboard relayed the call to his
home, and the associate, whom he did not identify, ``asked how we
could help. The serum could not be located in the United States,
only in Iran and the Soviet Union.''
   The presidential aide said he immediately set up conference calls
with people around the United States and in other countries. He said
doctors and other specialists advised the White House that the
serums Haast needed were not available in this country.
   What then transpired is an unusual joint-effort involving people
in the United States, Iran and the Soviet Union, with planes rushing
for clearance and being met on airport runways by U.S. government
emissaries seeking to protect the serum and get it delivered.
   Over the next several hours, Studdert said in an interview, he
arranged through U.S. government, medical and other private sources
for ``people-to-people, non-government'' contacts in Iran and direct
government contacts between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Using an American interpreter who speaks Farsi, Studdert put
Haast's representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists
in Iran, who located one of the necessary serums about two hours
from Tehran.
   Studdert explained that two different serums were needed _ one
for young Pakistani pit vipers and another one for the older snakes
of the same kind.
   Then, he said, he put Billy Dale, a White House transportation
office official, to work organizing the flight routes for delivering
the serums.
   Vials of the Iranian serum were flown by Luththansa to Frankfurt,
where the flight was met by representatives of the U.S. Consul
General's office and then transferred on an Air France flight to
Paris. The vial was then to be flown to New York's Kennedy Airport,
picked up by a federal Drug Enforcement Administration helicopter
and flown to LaGuardia and put on an America West flight scheduled
to arrive in Utah Saturday afternoon.
   Subsequently, Studdert and his colleagues located the second
serum _ the one for younger Pakistani pit vipers _ at the English
National Poison Unit in London, and that a British Airways flight
was headed from London to Los Angeles with that package.
   ``Doctors are going to go ahead and administer the serum from the
London young-snake unit,'' he said.
   In addition, another supply of the necessary serum was obtained
with through the Tashkent Institute of Vaccines, working
cooperatively with the United States through the Soviet Institute of
Health, Studdert said. That serum was put on an Aeroflot flight from
Tashkent to Moscow and was being flown to Frankfurt for eventual
shipment to the United States.
   ``When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want to
disturb the president,'' Studdert said. ``But I decided, this is
what the president would have wanted us to do.''
   ``We're not in the business of transporting pharmaceuticals,'' he
said. ``But this was a case where the medical solution was not
available in this country and we were happy to be able to play a
role.''

<TEXT>
   A panel of present and former White House
correspondents and former presidential press secretaries debated the
limits of reporting on private lives of public officials Friday,
with the John Tower confirmation battle as a backdrop.
   The discussion took place during a symposium on the press and the
presidency, sponsored by the National Press Foundation and the
Lyndon Baines Johnson Library.
   Eleanor Clift, who covered the White House and now covers
Congress for Newsweek, said there was an ``audible gasp'' when Tower
was asked at a Press Club luncheon earlier this week whether he had
ever violated his marriage vows.
   Tower, whose drinking habits and relations with women have
dominated debate over his nomination to be secretary of defense,
conceded he had done so, but said he didn't think he was alone.
   ``I think we all squirm a little when we get into these areas,''
Ms. Clift said. ``I think we all like to think there is a line
beyond which we personally don't go. I am uncomfortable. In the old
days there was a clear rule. If it didn't interfere with the
professional duties, it wasn't news. Well, the line between private
lives and professional duties is now so murky that almost anything
spills over. So we don't know where to draw the line.''
   Although the discussion tounched on the Tower controversy, the
question posed for the panelists was in the context of reporting
about the private lives of presidents and their families.
   James Gerstenzang of the Los Angeles Times said, ``If the
president is performing in front of us, if it's something we are
finding out, we are seeing or hearing about him, that's usable.''
   Frank Cormier, retired White House correspondent of The
Associated Press, told the group that when he was covering President
Kennedy aboard Air Force One, ``everything was off the record unless
specified otherwise.''
   ``It's very difficult for us in retrospect to realize how limited
in a sense things were 25 years ago,'' Cormier said.
   In the Johnson White House, he said, ``things got very fuzzy'' as
to what was off the record.
   ``I guess they've gotten less fuzzy now,'' he said. ``I guess
anything's fair game.''
   Marianne Means of Hearst Newspapers said reporters ``are tougher
on ourselves today in all these personal areas, as we are tougher on
our presidents.''
   Ms. Means said that when she first came to Washington, ``people
took free trips from people they were covering; the bottles of booze
would arrive at Christmas.''
   Sid Davis, a former White House correspondent for NBC News,
responded, ``It is true that journalists today don't take tickets
and booze and airplane rides, but I am not sure on the substance of
stories that the standards are better today than they were 15 or 20
years ago.''
   ``In the Kennedy era, we did hear stories about Kennedy's private
and social life, and those of us who covered Kennedy those days are
often asked why we never put those stories on the air,'' Davis said.
``The reason why we never put them on the air is because all we
heard was rumors.''
   ``There are things that happened when we were correspondents that
we didn't put on the air that would get on the air today or into
print today,'' he added.
   Larry Speakes, former spokesman for President Reagan, said
intense competition, spurred by the advent of 24-hour television,
``is driving the news to be stretched awfully thin at points.
Reporters are having to come up with some new angle on a story where
there may be no new angle.''
   Ms. Means said that the more ``packaged'' a candidate or
president become, the more ``sort of a cardboard person,'' the
greater is the pressure on reporters to ``get behind that and see
what the person is really like.''
   ``That's where we get into areas that we used to consider
strictly private,'' she said.
   Jody Powell, President Carter's press secretary, said he was
``recoiling at the thought that the packaging of the candidates
would suddenly cause us to begin writing about adultery. It seems to
me that is not exactly why we are doing it.''
   Gerald Warren, deputy press secretary to President Nixon, said,
``The press, I think all of us, must live up to a little higher
standard and I think when reports are floated around about elected
officials, both in the executive branch and on the Hill, I think we
should spend more time trying to prove or disprove those reports.''
   Helen Thomas, White House bureau chief for United Press
International, said, ``All those candidates put out a press release
every time they sneeze. They know that their life is going to be an
open book.''

   Five Carmelite nuns who have spent
five months barricaded inside their cloister, protesting what they
call the liberalization of their order, said they would defy their
eviction Friday by the Vatican.
   Two of the women who had taken temporary vows which expired
during the protest were told they must vacate the Monastery of the
Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, the Paterson Roman
Catholic Diocese announced.
   The diocese added that the two were no longer considered members
of the religious order.
   Two others were told they should seek residence in a different
convent, and the fifth, a 71-year-old nun who suffers from heart
problems, would be allowed to stay in the convent, said Tim Manning,
a spokesman for Paterson Bishop Frank Rodimer.
   Manning said he did not know if the five nuns would be forcibly
removed if they refused to leave. ``I think perhaps that maybe a bit
more time needs to elapse before those kind of decisions are made,''
he said.
   The nuns challenged the validity of the ruling Friday and said
they would continue their protest, said a spokeswoman for the group.
   ``Nothing came here with a Vatican seal on it,'' said the
spokeswoman, Betty Sutton. ``It's the Bishop's final trick to get
them out.''
   Five of the cloister's 13 nuns locked themselves in the infirmary
of their aged white-walled priory on Oct. 4 to protest the
introduction of such things as television and sweets into their
retreat.
   The nuns, saying they wanted the monastery returned to the
Carmelites' traditionally austere lifestyle, drew international
attention. Rodimer called the protest ``attempted anarchy.''
   The rebel nuns had said they had feared they would be evicted for
protesting the changes, which were initiated by their mother
superior, prioress Theresa Hewitt.
   ``Despite the difficult situation created by some of the
religious, the fundamental principles of religious life were firmly
retained with prudence and charity,'' read the ruling from the
Congregation for the Religious, the arm of the Vatican that oversees
religious communities.
   Mother Hewitt called the lock-in a ``scandal'' when the nuns took
over the infirmary and criticized the unruly members of her flock
for disrupting the cloistered lifestyle at the Carmel.
   The former Sister John was one of two nuns whose vows expired
during the protest, Manning said. She is now known as Nicole
Prescott and the other nun, the former Sister Bernadette, is now
known as Lynn Williams, he said.
   The other nuns were identified as Sister Philomena, who suffers
from heart problems, and Sister Teresita Romano and Sister Maria
Ercalano.

   Gunmen killed a Marxist political leader
and one othe person during an attack Friday at Bogota's
international airport, authorities said. Eight were wounded,
including a senator.
   Police said one attacker was killed by bodyguards and three were
captured.
   Jose Antequera, an executive board member of the Marxist-oriented
Patriotic Union, was fatally shot. Officials said he was the
apparent target. He had received death threats from right-wing
paramilitary organizations here.
   Also slain was Manuel Rodriguez, an official in the Attorney
General's Office.
   Sen. Ernesto Samper Pizano of the Liberal Party, a presidential
hopeful, was wounded. Two little girls and passengers waiting to
board planes also were injured.
   The attackers used 9mm automatic handguns. They struck at 3:40
p.m., when the political leaders arrived at the airport, escorted by
bodyguards, to fly to Cucuta, near the Venezuelan border, and
Barranquilla, on the Atlantic coast.
   ``I had finished checking in my luggage to fly to Miami, when I
heard explosions and I threw myself on the floor,'' witness Carlos
Mario Velez told The Associated Press. ``I saw many people shooting
indiscriminately.''
   ``Everybody panicked,'' some another witness, who refused to give
his name. ``Some people ran and other landed on the ground and other
looked for shelter in the bathrooms and behind the airline counters.
   ``When the shooting finished, after 10 minutes, there were many
people on the ground, wounded or dead.''
   Antequera was dead on arrival at the San Pedro Claver Clinic,
said Eliana Guerra, an emergency service spokeswoman.
   Colombian paramilitary groups in the past three years have killed
more than 400 political leaders and activists belonging to Communist
and Marxist parties or affiliated with them.
   Before switching to the Patriotic Union, Antequera two years ago
was chairman of the Communist youth organization.

   Christine Keeler, whose affair with a Cabinet
minister shook Harold Macmillan's government 26 years ago, was back
on the front pages Friday because of a movie about Britain's most
sensational postwar scandal.
   The 47-year-old former call girl appeared at the world premiere
of the movie ``Scandal'' Thursday night, accompanied by her
17-year-old son, Seymour.
   Critics loved the movie, but politicians condemned it for raking
up memories of the affair that forced a minister to resign, caused
the recall of a Soviet naval attache, and led to the suicide of a
prominent London osteopath.
   Anglican Bishop James Thompson of Stepney, in London's tough East
End, objected to the film for reviving interest in the downfall of
Ms. Keeler's former lover John Profumo, who was minister of state
for war.
   Profumo has long worked with alcoholics and the poor in the East
End, and in 1975 Queen Elizabeth II made him a Commander of the
Order of British Empire in recognition of his social service work.
   Ms. Keeler, who has had two failed marriages and lives on welfare
in a London public housing project, said she was glad the truth of
those wild days of 1963 had been put on film.
   The movie recounts her introduction to Dr. Stephen Ward, a
successful osteopath with left-wing sympathies and friends in high
places.
   Ward let Ms. Keeler live in his apartment and introduced her to
Capt. Eugene Ivanov, an assistant naval attache at the Soviet
Embassy. He took her to Lord Astor's country house, Cliveden, where
Profumo spotted Ms. Keeler, then 18, swimming naked in the pool.
   After Profumo's liaison with Ms. Keeler became public and it was
revealed that she also had an affair with Ivanov, members of
Parliament expressed concern that government secrets might have
leaked to the Soviets.
   Profumo denied in Parliament that he had slept with Ms. Keeler.
In the face of growing evidence, however, he later admitted he lied
to spare his wife, actress Valerie Hobson. He resigned June 5, 1963.
   Ward was charged with living on immoral earnings and denied it.
Just before his trial ended, when the case was going against him, he
killed himself.
   Ms. Keeler swapped high living for London's Holloway jail in 1964
when she was given a nine-month sentence for perjury during the
trial of another former lover, West Indian nightclub singer
``Lucky'' Gordon.
   A major argument arose in Prime Minister Macmillan's Conservative
government about how the matter was handled.
   Lord Denning, then one of Britain's top judges, found no evidence
that national security was endangered, but the Conservatives' image
was badly damaged and they lost the 1964 election.
   Except for Ms. Keeler, real-life protagonists skipped the
premiere of ``Scandal,'' but their screen counterparts showed up:
Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, who plays Ms. Keeler; John Hurt as Ward; Ian
McKellen as Profumo, and Britt Ekland as Mariella Novotny, a brothel
keeper.
   Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the opposition Labor Party, said
of the movie about Britain's most sensational postwar scandal: ``To
rake it up ... seems to be a disgrace to our society.''
   Conservative legislator Irvine Patrick said: ``Profumo has paid
the price and I think that to be dragged through it all again in
what is a created reconstruction is totally and utterly unfair.''
   Britain's largest circulation tabloid, The Sun, saw it
differently: ``Anyone who remembers the Sixties will enjoy this
film's nostalgia, anyone who doesn't will still find it
fascinating.''
   Shaun Usher wrote in the Daily Mail: ``This account of the
Profumo Affair is the most accomplished British commercial film in a
long time _ fluent, engrossing, racing along the story capsuled long
ago in that headline `The Minister, The Model and The Russian Spy.'''
   R. Barry O'Brien covered scandal for The Daily Telegraph in those
days and was one of the last people to talk with Ward before the
osteopath killed himself.
   ``The film does not tell the whole story, but does tell it the
way it was,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines said it cut its weekend schedule by
nearly 75 percent Friday but had supervisors and other workers ready
to keep the carrier operating ``indefinitely'' through a strike.
   Joseph Leonard, executive vice president and chief operating
officer, said Eastern was suspending service to nearly 60 cities on
Saturday and Sunday. Service will be maintained to almost 50 cities,
including Eastern's flights out of Miami and on its Northeast
shuttle and South American routes, Leonard said.
   The schedule changes were made as a midnight strike loomed by
Eastern's Machinists union.
   While nearly all of the more than 100 daily flights through Miami
will be maintained, Leonard said, most flights will be suspended at
Eastern's Atlanta hub.
   The company expects to gradually resume suspended flights if a
strike continued in to next week, he said. ``We do not want to
operate a schedule that is not 100 percent reliable.''
   Eastern ticket offices were extending their hours to reschedule
passengers from cancelled flights ``to the extent that is humanly
possible,'' he said.
   Eastern had strike contingency plans that would enable it to ``go
on indefinitely,'' Leonard said.
   The airline had adequate cash reserves, Leonard said, which other
sources have estimated at nearly $400 million. There were no plans
for layoffs or asset sales ``right now,'' Leonard told reporters
Friday evening.
   He said the airline would use only Eastern pilots and that there
were 200 experienced management pilots available. Although the
3,500-member pilots union planned to honor Machinists union picket
lines, Leonard predicted some union pilots would cross the picket
lines.
   Eastern's extensive strike plans also included hiring 1,100
experienced mechanics and technicians to augment management
maintenance workers, Leonard said.
   The company also has nonunion employees and supervisors ready to
fill in for flight attendants, whose 5,900-member union said it
would support the Machinists strike.
   Leonard said Eastern had actually improved its on-time
performance by 6 percent since sending the Machinists home Friday
morning to prevent sabotage. The carrier has led all major airlines
in on-time performance the past four months.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Mount Widespread Manhunt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal drug enforcers mounted their largest
manhunt in years Friday, dropping all pending investigations and
enlisting FBI aid to find an alleged drug dealer suspected of
killing an undercover narcotics agent.
   ``We are going to get him,'' vowed Robert Stutman, New York chief
of the Drug Enforcement Administration. He assigned all 500 agents
in his office to the hunt, with assistance from city police and FBI
agents nationwide.
   ``I am ceasing all other investigations in our office,'' the
largest in the DEA, Stutman said. ``Every agent will be working on
nothing else until we apprehend this suspect.''
   The search was for Constible Farace, 28, a paroled killer
suspected of firing four gunshots into undercover DEA Agent Everett
Hatcher on Tuesday. Hatcher had been trying to infiltrate a mob-run
cocaine ring.
   ``We've had leads. We've had calls. We're doing everything we
can,'' said Robert Strang, a DEA spokesman. ``Do we think we're
close? We think we are. We're going to continue to follow these
leads until we find him.''
   Hatcher, 46, was a 12-year veteran of the DEA in New York and its
first agent killed here since 1972. A Vietnam veteran, he was
unarmed when he was shot dead in his car in a remote area of Staten
Island.
   Outside a funeral home in Booton, N.J., Hatcher's widow, Mary
Jane, blamed her husband's death on casual drug users who keep drug
kingpins in business.
   ``A good man has been taken from us,'' she said, struggling to
keep back tears. ``The loss that we feel is exceedingly deep, almost
unbearable.''
   ``Even through the grief and our loss, I must ask the question,
who really killed Everett Emerson Hatcher? Who are the ultimate
guilty parties who create the market for the poison which he
valiantly tried to remove from our society.
   ``We middle-class suburban Americans. We casual users, we
dabblers in drugs, keep the market in drugs an ever-increasing
one,'' said Mrs. Hatcher.
   Agents assigned to trail Hatcher during his meeting with
suspected drug dealers lost contact with him in heavy traffic
shortly before finding him dead back at the meeting place.
   The Daily News reported that Hatcher bought about five ounces of
cocaine from Farace in previous meetings and was negotiating a
larger buy. The drug was thought to have been supplied by a Florida
distributor.
   Among other goals, investigators had been seeking to determine
whether reputed mobster Gerard Chilli, allegedly a powerful figure
in the Bonanno crime family, was involved in the drug ring.
   Farace was paroled in June after serving eight years for a
kidnap-murder. His uncle and cousin are reputed to be members of the
Colombo organized crime family, the News, New York Post and New York
Newsday reported.

   A small plane crashed into a front yard in a
suburban neighborhood Friday, killing at least one person aboard the
plane and setting a house on fire, officials said.
   ``It looks like it hit in front of the house and cartwheeled,''
said Roanoke County Fire Chief Tommy Fuqua said. ``We've got parts
throwed from one end of the block to the other end.''
   Three people in the house escaped, said Fuqua, but no one aboard
the plane was thought to have survived.
   State police Sgt. Steve Childress said investigators believe
there was only one fatality from the plane, but said they were not
certain because the wreckage was so scattered.
   ``We've got bits and pieces of airplane and body parts. We're
trying to put everything back together,'' Childress said.
   The single-engine Cessna crashed in rainy and foggy weather, and
the cause was under investigation.
   Dallas Bryant said he, his wife, Shirley and 20-year-old
daughter, Trina, were in the house when the plane hit their yard.
``We just heard this loud explosion,'' Bryant said. ``We were in the
den and watching TV. I jumped up and hit 911.''
   Bryant said he went outside through a side door. ``The trees were
on fire and it spilled gasoline all over the yard. It was foggy.
That may have had something to do with it.''
   Childress said a Federal Aviation Administration investigation
team would arrive Saturday.
   Childress said the plane reportedly was registered in Colorado
and had taken off from an airport in northern Virginia en route to
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg,
about 25 miles southwest of Roanoke.
   He said he was unaware of any radio communication between the
pilot and ground controllers.

   A fleet of tugboats and salvage ships worked in
rough seas and gusty wind Friday to refloat a grounded tanker and
stop any more of its cargo of 3.7 million gallons of crude oil from
reaching Oahu's beaches.
   Some of the 117,000 gallons of fuel and crude that spilled from
the 800-foot tanker continued to leak and washed ashore along a one-
to two-mile stretch of shore at Barbers Point on Oahu's southwest
coast, according to Coast Guard Lt. Brad Nelson.
   Capt. Gordon Piche, commanding officer of the Marine Safety
Office, said tugboat crews planned to try to free the ship at high
tide at 2 a.m. Saturday.
   Crews were unloading ballast water Friday afternoon and preparing
to remove some of the crude oil onto a barge, he said.
   Oil washed up on a beach where a popular tourist luau is held,
prompting the state Department of Health to post ``Polluted Waters''
signs, and at other areas as far as two miles to the north, said
Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Hubbard.
   Helicopter crews determined the oil slick was not edging toward
Honolulu, said Coast Guard spokesman David Santos.
   ``It's staying close to Barbers Point, and not drifting that
much,'' Santos said.
   Tugboat crews reported Friday morning that no more oil was
escaping from the Exxon Houston, according to Leonard Alcantara,
Honolulu attorney for Exxon Co. USA. The ship's 23 crewmembers were
not injured and remained aboard, he said.
   The Coast Guard's Pacific Area Strike Team was on its way from
the West Coast with equipment to clean up the spill, Nelson said.
   A local oil spill cleanup cooperative, called the Clean Islands
Council, was activated and on the scene, said Les Rogers, spokesman
for Exxon Co. USA, the Houston-based domestic oil and gas division
of Exxon Corp.
   ``In addition, Exxon has initiated response steps, including
authorization of more tugs, if needed, to free the vessel,'' he said.
   Elsewhere, an oil slick was spotted Friday off sensitive marine
reserves in the northern Florida Keys, but Coast Guard officials
said the spill did not appear to be a threat to the area.
   Parks in the area reported small gobs of tar washing up, and said
there did not appear to be major damage. Coast Guard spokesman Joe
Dye said dead birds were found out near the oil, but it was not
clear if they were killed by the slick.
   ``We have no idea where it came from,'' he said. ``There are
apparently no ships in the area.''
   In Antarctica, the second oil spill in a month has been brought
under control by Chilean navy personnel using chemical solvents to
fight a kilometer-long slick created by a grounded Peruvian
scientific ship, a Chilean navy spokesman said Friday. Leaks in two
damaged tanks on the Humboldt were sealed by divers, he said.
   On Jan. 28, an Argentine navy ship, the Bahia Paraiso, ran
aground off an Antarctic peninsula some 300 miles from the site of
the Humboldt's accident, creating a major oil slick. It was
eventually cleaned up by ships and personnel from Argentina, Chile
and the United States.
   The Hawaii spill occurred Thursday evening about 15 miles from
Honolulu, but an Oahu Civil Defense spokesman said it was unlikely
the oil would reach famed Waikiki Beach to the east.
   ``The chances of that happening are very, very slim,'' said
spokesman Frank Apel. ``It's just too far away.''
   There was no trace of oil along the shoreline beyond Barbers
Point, Nelson said, and there was no immediate move to close any
beaches. There also was no evidence of affected marine life or
seabirds being washed ashore, he said.
   Currents normally would carry the oil to the northwest away from
Honolulu, but gusty wind was blowing it in the opposite direction,
he said.
   Nine tugboats worked to refloat the Exxon Houston, which broke
free of its moorings and apparently drifted onto a reef during rough
seas Thursday evening, Nelson said.
   The ship's hull suffered minor damage, but was sitting in 16 feet
of water and was in no danger of sinking, Nelson said.
   ``We do know that one of the ship's fuel tanks and at least one
of the empty cargo tanks have been breached,'' said Rogers.
   The vessel was three-tenths of mile off Barbers Point on Oahu's
southwest coast and had just unloaded 16.8 million gallons of Alaska
North Slope crude oil to the Hawaiian Independent Refinery when it
broke free of its moorings, Nelson said.
   The crew initially declined Coast Guard assistance, but the
ship's captain, Kevin Dick, later reported that the vessel was
``hard aground'' Nelson said.
   An estimated 25,000 gallons of crude oil spilled when the tanker
broke free during unloading, and 92,000 gallons of heavy bunker fuel
oil spilled when an aft tank was ruptured when the tanker went
aground, Nelson said.

   A Chilean couple who were denied political
asylum in Norway tried to give away their five children Thursday by
advertising for a foster home in a Norwegian newspaper.
   ``Isn't there a nice Norwegian family that wants to be parents to
Oscar, 10, Luis, 6, Nicolas, 4, Natalia, 2, and Patricia, three
months?'' asked the couple in the Faedrelandsvennen newspaper in the
southern town of Kristiansand.
   Juan Patricio Arrancibia Collao and his wife Raquel Quesada
Molina took the painful step because they feared their children
would be killed or disappear if they returned to Chile, the national
news agency NTB reported.
   ``This is the first time we've seen anything like this,'' said
Tove Johnsen, manager of the Kristiansand Immigrants' Office.
   ``I consider it very serious that a family has reacted so
strongly to a rejection that they would give their children up for
adoption rather than take them out of the country,'' she told the
news service.
   The couple's attorney, Sverre Nordmo, told NTB they still can
appeal their deportation order by April 6, and that he was surprised
when they took such desperate action.
   When he arrived here in March 1988, Collao told officials he had
been tortured in a Chilean prison in late 1987. His family followed
him to Norway the following month, NTB said.
   Most of the 900 or so Chileans who arrived during the first half
of 1988 risk being deported because Norwegian authorities believe
they would be in no real danger in their homeland, according to the
Norwegian Ministry of Justice.
   By the latest count from the state Bureau of Statistics there
were 3,747 Chileans living in Norway in July 1988.

<BYLINE>Six Charged in `Business of Death' ^By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Six leaders of a violent, multimillion-dollar
crack ring were charged Thursday with nine murders and seven
attempted murders, officials said.
   The defendants, all from Brooklyn, were in ``the business of
death,'' said District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman. ``These gang
members allegedly killed not only members of rival drug gangs but
tried to enforce their writ by killing their own employees to
enforce discipline.''
   The leaders also were accused of murdering three innocent
bystanders in the course of operating the multimillion-dollar crack
ring, Holtzman said.
   ``I think we got one of the major gangs,'' said New York Police
Chief of Detectives, Robert Colangelo. ``There are several others
but none have its scope and violence.''
   A 70-count indictment charged the six men with enterprise
corruption under the state's version of the federal racketeering
statute. They also face numerous counts of murder, attempted murder,
assault, weapons and drug charges.
   The crimes outlined in the indictment occurred between June 1987
and last month. If convicted, the defendants would face up to life
in prison.
   The drug ring had about 50 members and six retail locations in
east New York that each brought in $10,000 to $25,000 daily,
officials said.
   ``The group was particularly callous in terms of sellin to
youths,'' said Colangelo, who noted that two of the locations were
near public schools.
   The gang's alleged leader was identified as Samuel Edmonson, 28,
who was on parole for a robbery conviction.
   The other defendants are John Amante, 31; Kyle Patterson, 24;
Victor Breland, 32; Winston Easterling, 19; and Robinson, 28.
Edmonson and Amante were arrested Wednesday and the other four were
arrested earlier, officials said.
   In addition to the arrests, authorities seized $106,000 in cash,
various guns, more than 400 vials of crack, the highly addictive
cocaine derivative, and three ounces of cocaine, Holtzman said.

<HEAD>Judge: Evidence Enough to Try Contra Supporter In Drug Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Thursday there is
sufficient evidence to try U.S.-born John Hull for drug trafficking
and violating Costa Rican security by providing arms to Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Judge Maximo Esquivel of the Superior Court tribunal in San
Carlos would not say what evidence he used to make his decision.
   The judge said evidence indicates that between 1982 and 1986,
Hull worked with a Costa Rican citizen to provide arms to Nicaraguan
rebels, known as the Contras, in their guerrilla war against the
lefist Nicaraguan government.
   A trial date has not been set.
   Hull will be tried in San Carlos, about 105 miles northwest of
San Jose, because the crimes allegedly were committed in that
jurisdiction.
   Hull, 69, a former Indiana resident, has lived in Costa Rica for
20 years. He has said he became a Costa Rican citizen eight years
ago.
   Hull has acknowledged supporting the Contras and has said that in
the past he let them use his property in Los Chiles, 81 miles
northwest of San Jose.
   Hull was been in custody since Jan. 13, when he was arrested by
Costa Rican authorities. Since Feb. 14 he has been jailed in San
Carlos after spending time in a hospital for heart problems.
   Sources in the Office of Judicial Investigations have said they
acted after residents near Hull's farm on the Nicaraguan border
denounced activities by him that were seen as possibly endangering
relations between Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
   Hull's attorney, Rita Herrera, said Thursday said she would
appeal the judge's ruling.
   She and other defense attorneys have tried unsuccessfully to have
Hull released on bail. The 4th District Court in San Jose
provisionally set bail at $12,500, but the superior court tribunal
in Alejuela Province, where the trial was later moved, denied bail
because of the severity of the charges.
   Herrera has argued that Hull's arrest was politically motivated.
   Hull in the past has strongly denied any connection to drug
trafficking.
   Witnesses testifying before Congress on illegal arms shipments to
the Contras said Hull's ranch was a way station for gun smugglers
and cocaine traffickers.
   Hull was among 29 people named in a civil suit filed last year by
two journalists. Tony Avirgan filed the suit with his wife, Martha
Honey, after being wounded in a 1984 news conference bombing blamed
on the defendants.
   A U.S. district juddge in Miami ruled in favor of the defendants,
saying the plaintiffs failed to prove their contention that a
conspiracy was behind the bombing.
   Eight people were killed in the bombing and the apparent target,
then-Contra leader Eden Pastora, was wounded.

   A communist rebel leader on Thursday
rejected President Corazon Aquino's demand that the guerrillas lay
down their arms in exchange for peace talks, and guerrillas killed
an outspoken anti-communist mayor.
   Luis Jalandoni, foreign liaison officer of the National
Democratic Front based in the Netherlands, said in an interview with
a Manila radio station that the rebels were willing to find a
peaceful solution to the 20-year conflict.
   ``The (Front) is very willing to find a solution, a negotiated
political settlement for a just and lasting peace,'' said Jalandoni,
a former priest. ``But the condition that we should surrender is a
pre-condition that is impossible.''
   Last week, Mrs. Aquino said she was willing to renew peace talks
if the 24,000-strong New People's Army lays down its arms.
   The Front is an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups,
including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing,
the New Peoples Army.
   Jalandoni said Mrs. Aquino's stand showed the president ``closed
her mind to the reality that the NDF is a political force that has
been struggling for years, that it has influence over 10,000
villages and that it cannot surrender areas and people who
sacrificed because of their principles and programs.''
   The military claims Jalandoni, who has both Dutch and Filipino
citizenship, is a member of the central committee of the outlawed
Communist Party. Jalandoni is believed to be in charge of rebel
fund-raising activities in Europe.
   Mrs. Aquino opened peace talks with the Front in 1986 but
negotiations collapsed in January 1987 after she refused rebel
power-sharing demands.
   Last week, Front spokesman Satur Ocampo said the rebels would
consider resuming peace talks if the Aquino government agreed to
close the six American military bases here when their lease expires
in 1991.
   Also Thursday, police said Capistrano Legaspi, mayor of the town
of Kinogitan in Misamis Oriental province, was slain Wednesday by
three suspected rebel assassins.
   The report said Legaspi was waiting for a ride home when the
rebels approached and opened fire in the town about 470 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Legaspi was an outspoken opponent of the rebel movement.

   Mortality rates in the United States for two of
the three leading causes of death _ heart disease and stroke _ are
headed down, the national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday.
   However, the second-leading cause of death, cancer, is going up.
   The CDC said the U.S. death rate from heart disease in 1987 was
313 per 100,000 people, down from 318 the year before. For stroke _
or cerebrovascular disease _ the rate was 61 per 100,000, down from
62.
   There were 196 cancer deaths in 1987 for every 100,000 Americans,
up from 195 the year before.
   Heart disease, cancer and stroke account for about two-thirds of
the 2 million deaths that occur in this country every year, the
Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   In actual numbers, heart disease killed 762,820 of the 2.2
million Americans who died in 1987. Cancer killed 477,190, and
stroke killed 149,220. A year earlier, 2.1 million Americans died,
including 765,490 from heart disease, 469,376 from cancer and
149,643 from stroke, according to Dr. Harry Rosenberg, a researcher
with the National Center for Health Statistics.
   ``What we are seeing ... is the continuation of some long-term
trends,'' Rosenberg said.
   The decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke has been
going on for a decade, said Thomas Thom, an epidemiologist with the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Most experts believe the
decline can be attributed to improvements in personal health,
greater prevention of disease, improvement in medical care for heart
or stroke patients, or all of those factors, Thom said.
   ``The decline is ... very real, and very consistent,'' he said.
``There's got to be something doing it.''
   Specifically, he cited trends toward quitting smoking,
controlling high blood pressure and lowering cholesterol levels, as
well as ``increased physical activity and, generally, health
consciousness.'' At the same time, cardiac intensive care units have
come into widespread use in hospitals, and heart surgery has become
commonplace.
   ``There are plenty of reasons to think all those reasons
contributed,'' he said.
   Rosenberg said the cancer rate, which has been rising as those
Americans age whose lifestyles included more smoking and more
unhealthy foods, should fall in the coming years because of changing
lifestyles among the young.
   ``We see the beginnings of the overall decrease in cancer
mortality in a decrease among all age groups of people younger than
55, particularly young males,'' he said.
   Among 45- to 54-year-olds, Rosenberg said the cancer rate dropped
from 181 per 100,000 in 1979 to 166 per 100,000 in 1986. He said
preventive measures of the past two decades, such as improved diet
and less smoking, contributed to that drop.
   Complete mortality figures from 1988 are not yet available,
Rosenberg said.
   The mortality rate from heart disease was showing a slight
increase from 1987 levels in the 12 months from October 1987 to
September 1988, he said, but that might be traced, in part, to an
influenza epidemic last winter which preyed upon those at increased
risk of problems from flu _ such as patients with chronic heart
disease.

   A Spanish air force helicopter burst into
flames over Madrid on Thursday and crashed into a heavily populated
area, killing the three crew members but causing no injuries on the
ground, police said.
   The front of the helicopter hurtled into the empty recess area of
the Blas de Otero secondary school, said a Madrid police official
who asked not to be identified.
   He said the tail landed 60 yards away in a private courtyard.
   ``The students were apparently inside the building, in class, at
the time of the accident,'' he said.
   The police official said firefighters quickly extinguished the
burning wreckage in the heavily populated southeast Aluche
neighborhood and added the crash had no impact on a shopping center
about 100 yards away.
   ``There was an explosion, then (the helicopter) started doing
somersaults and the rotor broke loose and then the tail
disintegrated,'' a witness to the accident told Spanish National
Radio.
   ``It's a good thing the helicopter pilot managed to avoid
crashing into the tall buildings that surround the area,'' Madrid
Mayor Juan Barranco told reporters on the scene.
   ``Thanks to the cool courage of the pilot there weren't any more
deaths,'' the mayor said.
   Air Force spokesman Cmdr. Julian Fernandez Torregrosa said the
accident killed the helicoper's pilot, co-pilot and mechanic, whom
he identified as Capt. Alfredo Vidal Montero, 33; Capt. Ramon
Garrido de la Parra, 30; and 2nd Lt. Jose Rodriguez Montero.
   Fernandez said the French-built Puma helicopter was on a routine
training mission.

<HEAD>Japan, France To Cut Iranian Oil Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and France plan to cut imports of Iranian oil,
officials said Thursday, but neither depicted the move as being in
reaction to a death threat against novelist Salman Rushdie by Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   A French oil company official, however, said the French decision
was linked to worsening relations with Iran after Khomeini, Iran's
revolutionary and religious patriarch, attacked Rushdie over his
book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Many Moslems find the book blasphemous.
   Japan's cutback will be up to 20 percent over the next three
months. Officials in the trade and foreign ministryies said it was
because of a seasonal decline in demand and not motivated by the
Rushdie affair.
   ``It's true that there will be a decline in coming months but it
has nothing to do with political issues,'' said Tsukasa Kawada,
deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Energy Resources Division.
   In Paris, an Industry Ministry spokesman said oil companies were
urged to slacken imports about 10 days ago.
   While France issued no formal directive on cutting oil imports, a
senior official from the Industry Ministry's hydrocarbons service
``suggested'' to French oil companies that they trim imports
following Khomeini's death threats against Rushdie, according to
industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The suggestion was not overtly linked to the Rushdie matter.
Officials suggested only that a high level of imports was
``inappropriate'' at this time.
   But one official at a major French oil company said, ``It was
suggested to us it would be inappropriate for us to increase our
imports of Iranian crude, or to maintain them at a high level, in
the present diplomatic context.''
   Khomeini's call on Feb. 14 for Moslems to kill Rushdie provoked
some economic backlash in Europe, notably West Germany. All member
nations of the European Economic Community recalled their
ambassadors from Tehran.
   Japan condemned the death edict but did not withdraw its
ambassador.
   So far this year, Japanese purchases of Iranian crude averaged
about 300,000 barrels a day, greater than in previous months because
of the larger winter demand. Purchases are likely to drop to
240,000-250,000 barrels in the second quarter, oil company officials
say.
   Last year, Iranian oil accounted for 5.7 percent of total
Japanese oil imports, a drop of 18.3 percent from 1987.

<HEAD>China May Have 260 Million Surplus Workers by End of Century</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China will have up to 260 million surplus workers
by the end of the century, threatening serious economic disruption
if more jobs aren't found, an official daily said Thursday.
   The Economic Daily said more than 200 million of the surplus
laborers reside in overpopulated rural areas.
   The report came as cities in this nation of 1 billion try to cope
with a deluge of rural migrants looking for better-paying city jobs.
The prosperous southern province of Guangdong has put out an
emergency appeal to the state to help it handle 2.5 million mostly
rural outsiders who have flocked to the province in recent weeks.
   The daily, citing a report by the China Rural Development
Research Center, said China's labor force is growing by an estimated
10 million a year, outstripping the number of new jobs.
   The State Statistical Bureau said earlier this week that the
urban work force increased by 3.6 million last year to 135.7 million.
   The report did not estimate how many of the surplus workers would
be unemployed. Although the government has called on businesses to
operate more efficiently, most state-run plants continue to retain
their excess workers rather than lay them off.
   Economists say 20 to 30 million of the urban work force is excess
manpower which could be cut without affecting production.
   In the countryside, about 80 million peasants have left the farm
to work at small rural enterprises that have shot up during the past
decade of economic reforms.
   However, many of these enterprises are now in trouble or closing
down because of inefficiency, lack of energy and basic materials, or
a cutoff in credit as the government moves to slow down the
overheated economy.
   The report said that while laborers exceed job opportunities in
China's underdeveloped areas, there is still a demand for labor in
developed sections of the country.
   It suggested an easing of the nation's strict residence
regulations to allow for greater worker mobility. The country should
also set up a special rural labor development organization to
organize rural laborers for work on the international labor market,
it said.

   The Common Market has agreed to cut its
use of chlorofluorocarbons, the synthetic compounds that destroy the
Earth's ozone layer, by 85 percent and seek a total ban on its
production by the end of the century.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, invented in 1930, are used in aerosol
sprays, refrigeration coolants, cleaning agents and several other
products. The compounds are blamed for depletion of the ozone layer
that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays and
for an increase in skin cancer.
   Environmental officials meeting in Brussels agreed Thursday to
give the 12 EEC member nations a mandate to completely phase out the
manufacture and use of the compounds by the year 2000. In
Washington, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William
Reilly urged President Bush to support the chlorofluorocarbon
phase-out by the end of the century. But his proposal was not
immediately endorsed by the administration, the Washington Post
reported today.

   The Bush administration is proposing a new U.S.
policy toward Central America that includes rewards for Nicaragua if
it passes certain ``checkpoints'' on the road to democracy, say
congressional and administration sources.
   While still in its formative stages, the new policy is outlined
in a secret 10-page document Secretary of State James A. Baker III
showed to House and Senate leaders Thursday during a hastily
arranged visit to Capitol Hill. Baker made clear to lawmakers that
he does not intend to abandon the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.
   He told congressional officials he would seek to renew the U.S.
``humanitarian'' aid, which runs out at the end of this month, for a
year, according to some present at the meetings. Aid would continue
to flow at current rates _ about $4 million a month _ and would keep
the rebels available as a standby fighting force until after
Nicaragua's national elections, which are being moved up to early
1990.

   U.S. mortality rates for two of the three leading
causes of death _ heart disease and stroke _ are headed downward,
but cancer is on the increase as unhealthy habits of yesteryear
catch up with the older population.
   The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that the U.S. death
rate from heart disease in 1987 was 313 per 100,000 people, down
from 318 the year before. For stroke, or cerebrovascular disease,
the rate was 61 per 100,000, down from 62.
   But the mortality rate from cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer,

   A city program considered a national model for
steering contracts to minority businesses was overturned as too
``intrusive'' by the state Supreme Court, a ruling officials say
could halt contracting for months.
   The court based Thursday's 7-0 decision on a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling in January that overturned a similar program in Richmond, Va.
It was the high court's first reversal of an affirmative action
program after years of upholding them.
   The state court said Atlanta failed to produce enough evidence of
past discrimination to justify its program. It also said the program
was too broadly drawn and that the city had not considered ``less
intrusive'' methods of increasing minority participation in city
contracts. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on behalf
of the American Subcontractors Association effectively dismantles
the program.

   President Bush called Friday for banning the
production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the
century if adequate substitutes can be found.
   His move to protect the world's ozone layer, which shields the
earth from much of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, came
on the heels of a decision Thursday by 12 European countries to
pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on
production, as the world's industrial nations had earlier agreed to
do.
   The United States accounts for about one-third of the production
of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air
conditioners and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer
equipment.
   Richard K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,

   January's rise in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators
followed a 0.7 percent increase in December, providing fresh
evidence that 1989 opened on a strong note despite widespread
expectations of an impending slowdown.
   The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine

   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
January's rise in the index ``shows a moderate level of growth which

   Airports handling heavy Eastern Airlines traffic are
boosting police patrols, designating picket areas and mapping
contingency plans for the expected strike this weekend of the
airline's Machinists union.
   In South Florida, home region of the Miami-based carrier, all
three regional airports began planning days ahead of the Machinists'
strike deadline at 12:01 a.m. Saturday how to keep operations
running smoothly.
   In St. Paul, Minn., a federal judge issued an order barring
Northwest Airlines' 21,000-member Machinists' union from staging a
sympathy strike in the event of a walkout.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson said his temporary restraining
order ``is in the best interests of the public'' to avoid disrupting
flights.
   The order, which had been sought by the Eagan-based airline,
remains in effect until a March 13 hearing on whether to grant
Northwest's request for a preliminary injunction against the union.
   Guy Cook, chairman of the Machinists' local at Northwest, called
Magnuson's ruling ``another nail in the coffin of labor people.''
   At Miami International Airport, adjacent to Eastern's corporate
headquarters, extensive preparations have been made ``to maintain
the airport operating and protect the public's right of access to
the airport,'' according to Dade County Aviation Department
spokeswoman Amalia Fernandez.
   There will be heavy weekend staffing, strictly designated
picketing areas, extra tow trucks to keep ramps and roads clear, and
additional Metro-Dade police officers on duty throughout the
sprawling facility, Ms. Fernandez said.
   Additional staff will be assigned to airport terminals to help
stranded or delayed passengers, she said.
   On Thursday, a caravan of about 2,000 Machinists slowly drove
vehicles past the Miami airport terminal, causing a massive traffic
jam that angered airline passengers. Similar protests were held in
several other cities, including Newark, N.J.
   At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport north of
Miami, Broward County Sheriff's Lt. Jack Greeney, Executive Office
of the department's airport division, said he plans to double
airport deputy patrols Friday night.
   Greeney said he has been in touch with both the local Machinists'
union and Eastern management to seek cooperation in keeping heads
cool in the event of a strike.
   ``We've informed both of them we're not going to tolerate any
acts of violence from anyone,'' Greeney said.
   At Palm Beach International Airport, operations spokesman Jerry
Allen, like his counterparts at several other Eastern-linked
airports around the country, spent Thursday meeting with police and
city officials for strike preparations.
   Additional security arrangements also were established at
airports in Atlanta, Washington, Newark, Seattle and Philadelphia.
   In both Washington and Newark, officials expressed additional
concern over possible rail strikes in solidarity with Eastern's
machinists.
   In the New York area, commuter railroads are expecting to be hit
by a secondary strike if the Machinists walk out as threatened.
   The Long Island Rail Road, which has about 135,000 daily riders,
and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, which carries 95,000 daily
commuters, both are vulnerable, along with New Jersey Transit and
freight railroads.
   In Washington, the head of Amtrak said the national passenger
railroad would continue limited operations for only a few days if
picketed by workers supporting any strike against Eastern.
   W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, also said that if
Eastern is struck and sympathetic workers do not picket the
railroad, Amtrak would add trains between New York and Washington
and possibly between New York and Boston.
   Amtrak spokesman R. Clifford Black in Washington said a strike in
the area by rail workers would affect 5,000 commuters who travel
daily by train into and out of the capital.

   Federal mediators said a new contract offer was
being considered by Eastern Airlines and its Machinists, and they
expressed hope of averting a Friday midnight strike that could
disrupt travel nationwide.
   The union said Thursday the company had made the new offer, but
Eastern declined to confirm that, citing a news blackout.
   Eastern pilots, meanwhile, rejected a separate company offer
designed to keep them from staging a sympathy strike with the
Machinists. Both the pilots and flight attendants said they would
refuse to cross picket lines if a strike is called after the end of
a federally imposed cooling-off period Friday night.

   Under the previous rules, a company had up to 15 days to report
the resignation of its auditor in a dispute and an additional 30
days after that to make public a letter from the auditor outlining

   Here is a look at Eastern Airlines, which is facing a strike by
its Machinists at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday unless negotiators reach
an unexpected breakthrough in a 17-month-old contract dispute.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Owner: The 60-year-old airline has been owned by Texas Air Corp.,
headed by Chairman Frank Lorenzo, since 1986.
   Headquarters: Miami.
   Employees: 31,200, including 8,500 members of the Machinists
union, which includes mechanics, bag handlers and other ground
workers; 3,500 pilots and 5,900 flight attendants.
   Size of fleet: 250 jets.
   Cities served: 118, with its major markets in South Florida, the
Caribbean, the East Coast and Latin America.
   Number of flights: 1,040 daily.
   Passengers: 100,000 average daily.
   Main strike issues: Eastern, which claims it lost $1 billion in
the past decade and is losing more than $1 million a day, is seeking
$150 million in wage concessions. The Machinists are seeking $50
million in raises.
   Where negotiations stand: The National Mediation Board in
Washington is trying to get both sides to reach a settlement before
the strike deadline. The board has asked President Bush to appoint
an emergency panel that could delay the strike 60 days. The White
House said Thursday that no decision had been made.
   In the event of a strike: Eastern has vowed to continue flying,
although company officials refuse to divulge contingency plans. The
company promised passengers would be rerouted or given refunds on
any canceled flights. The Machinists have threatened to picket other
airlines, ships and railroads, and AFL-CIO officials have said they
want their 14 million members to support the Eastern Machinists.

<TEXT>
   The Eastern Airlines showdown pits one of the
airline industry's most feared bosses against a union leader who may
be the industry's most stubborn.
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, 48, is a Queens, N.Y.,
son of Spanish immigrants, Harvard Business School graduate and
aggressive builder of the nation's largest airline company.
   He's had no success dealing with Machinists union District 100
President Charles E. Bryan, 55, a West Virginia-born mechanic and
magnetic, self-educated man who says he takes his strategies from
Zen, the Bible, Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and the ancient
Chinese author Sun-tzu's ``The Art of War.''
   With a Machinists union strike deadline set for midnight EST
Friday, about the only point the two driven men agree on is that
Eastern may not survive a strike.
   Lorenzo bought Eastern three years ago with a warning that
``there ain't no Santa Claus,'' and his new management sent
Eastern's usually tense labor relations plummeting to new lows with
wage concession demands, toughened work rules and thousands of
layoffs, firings and suspensions.
   His Eastern management has added to a union-busting reputation he
gained when he ended a labor confrontation at Continental Airlines
in 1983 by taking the carrier into bankruptcy reorganization and
getting union contracts abrogated.
   Texas Air has outraged Eastern unions by taking over Eastern's
computerized reservations system, collecting tens of millions of
dollars in ``management fees'' and loans from Eastern, and agreeing
to sell Eastern's profitable and prestigious Northeast shuttle
service to developer Donald Trump. That $365 million sale is not
final.
   Management says it has tried to work with Bryan, but that the
union leader wants to run the airline himself. A booklet titled
``Charlie Says ...'' put out recently by Eastern warns: ``If Charlie
isn't stopped, he will destroy Eastern.''
   Former Eastern chairman Frank Borman says Bryan has ``a
certifiably insane dream'' of running the airline himself, and
Borman recently compared Bryan to cult leader Jim Jones, who led a
mass suicide of followers in Guyana in 1978.
   Bryan, elected president of Eastern's largest union in 1980 and
overwhelmingly re-elected twice, got Borman to back down and give
pay increases in 1983 on the last day of a Machinists strike
deadline.
   In 1986, with Eastern facing bankruptcy, Bryan refused to join
the pilots and flight attendants in making wage concessions unless
they were tied to Borman's ouster. Eastern's board of directors
refused, and sold the company to Lorenzo, who built tiny,
money-losing Texas International into the Houston-based Texas Air
Corp. that took over Continental Airlines, New York Air, People
Express, Frontier and other small carriers.
   Lorenzo, who initially indicated he wouldn't involve himself in
Eastern's labor situation, ignored a post-sale telegram from Bryan
asking for a meeting. But last year, as negotiations with the
Machinists stalemated and Eastern unions fought management with
myriad lawsuits and political lobbying, Lorenzo had dinner with
Bryan in Houston.
   The dinner only led to more disputes and Bryan continued to hope
for a buyout of Eastern. Bryan contends that Eastern has been badly
mismanaged for years at the employees' expense, and that workers
would increase productivity and service with more input into how the
company is run.
   Corporate kingpins Carl Icahn, T. Boone Pickens and Trump have
all been approached by Eastern unions about buying Eastern, but
Texas Air, which has posted record losses since taking over the
airline, has said there are no buyers on the horizon.
   Bryan, a mechanic since 1956 at an airline whose last strike was
in 1966, has seen his union rolls reduced from 12,000 to 8,500 since
the Texas Air takeover.
   ``Our people have been frustrated, there have been attempts to
provoke wildcat strikes,'' Bryan said recently. ``They have been
brutalized by management that doesn't care about the company's
future.''
   While promising ``a wing-ding of a strike,'' Bryan also worried
that the company may not survive.
   ``We've fought them as long as we could and we've had some
success,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, our system doesn't seem to look
out for the working man.''
   Lorenzo, meanwhile, made a last-ditch personal appeal to Eastern
pilots this week. In a videotape showing a shirt-sleeved Lorenzo in
a homey easy chair, he urged: ``Eastern is either going to make it
through this period, make the changes that are necessary and go on
and succeed ... or I'm afraid Eastern is going to go through this
juncture and perhaps end up in the corporate graveyard.''

<HEAD>Europe To Urge U.S. To Amend Computer Reservations System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western European aviation officials have
urged Washington to end a built-in bias against European air
carriers in the five computerized reservation systems used by U.S.
airlines and travel agents.
   These systems are programmed to favor U.S. carriers though
European airlines fly the same routes to Europe and in much less
time, the European officials said Thursday.
   ``Consumers suffer from not always being given ready access to
the best (flight) information,'' by U.S. computerized reservation
systems, Edward Hudson, secretary of the 22-nation European Civil
Aviation Conference, told reporters.
   Representatives of the two biggest U.S. computerized reservation
services, Apollo and Sabre, said the criticism came at a time when
they were taking steps to correct the situation.
   ``I'm surprised that they would be saying this now with all the
things that have happened in the recent past,'' said Karen Cook, a
spokeswoman for American Airlines' Sabre system.
   Since December, Sabre has offered travel agents two ways of
displaying flight information, one of which is more favorable to
European airlines, Ms. Cook said. Apollo plans to offer two display
options starting later this month, according to John McIntyre,
director of products marketing for Covia, the parent of Apollo.
   The European accusations echo accusations by U.S. airlines that
American and United Air Lines discriminated against other carriers
with their reservation systems. Since 1984 the Civil Aeronautics
Board has required the systems not to give any preferential
treatment.
   Hudson said he would raise the issue in a meeting with U.S.
Department of Transportation officials this month. To date, ``There
has been a marked reluctance from the U.S. government to open its
ears to what has been said by the Europeans,'' he added.
   Reservations made through U.S. computerized reservation systems
often involve ``unnecessarily lengthy journey times with long
overlays at connecting points'' because the computers favor U.S.
carriers, Hudson said.
   He said they list U.S. carriers on the first screen while flights
of European carriers are tucked away on remote screens that booking
agents do not check unless travellers say at what hour they want to
leave.
   The five U.S. systems are known as Apollo, Sabre, Pars, Datas-II
and System One. Hudson said none gives priority to flights to Europe
where warranted.
   As an example, he cited a non-stop San Francisco-to-Paris flight
on France's UTA airline that he said is up to 5{ hours faster than
flights on major U.S. carriers that make stopovers. Yet Sabre puts
the UTA flight on screen 9 rather than on the first screen, he said.
   Flights of Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa, Alitalia and
SAS get similar treatment though they get travelers from California
to Europe hours faster than U.S. carriers, he said.
   Hudson said the 22 ECAC nations will issue next week rules of
conduct for Western Europe's two main computerized reservation
systems, Amadeus and Galileo. These rules, he said, give
non-European carriers first-screen priority if their flights are
more convenient. He called on the U.S. government to do likewise.

   Terry Rakolta won a skirmish and now she wants to
start a battle against what she says are sexually oriented and
violent programs that cut into the network television fare her
children can watch.
   ``The American family is beng painted into a corner. It's an
invasion of my privacy at this point,'' Rakolta said Thursday.
   A flurry of letters starting in January brought Rakolta apologies
from advertisers on the top-rated, prime-time ``Married ... With
Children'' program. Some pulled their ads on the Fox Broadcasting
Co. series.
   Rakolta said Thursday she objects to having to monitor prime-time
television for shows she doesn't want her younger children to watch.
``If people want that stuff, they can pay for it, or rent it, or go
to the movies,'' she said.
   Rakolta said she intends to start a group, or join existing ones,
to organize national boycotts of advertisers.
   ``One person can really make a difference if they push the right
buttons. And the right buttons are not the producers in Hollywood,
they're the people that pay the money for the show,'' she said.
   The activism is new, said Rakolta, 40, who lives in affluent
Bloomfield Hills in suburban Detroit. She has daughters ages 18, 10
and 9, and a son, 8. Her husband, John Rakolta, is president of a
large construction company.
   ``I've never been involved in a cause. I've been involved in
civic groups, but nothing cause-oriented,'' she said.
   But she said that when she and her children watched ``Married ...
With Children'' one Sunday night in January, she ended up shooing
the children out of the room.
   The situation comedy, which began in 1987 and is Fox's most
successful show, is about a blue-collar family headed by shoe-store
clerk Al Bundy. Rakolta said the first show she saw featured a man's
visit to a lingerie store.
   ``In the store, one woman removed her bra for strangers, asking
how she looked. It showed a man that worked there, an older man,
walking around in a garter belt. They mentioned vibrators on the
show,'' Rakolta said.
   ``I was thinking it was a family program because it was prime
time, 8:30 p.m. I was horrified. I wanted to know what kind of
sponsors would sponsor a show like this,'' she said.
   Rakolta said she watched other episodes to see who advertised. On
one, she said, the father asked his children, with his wife standing
nearby, what women and ``dog do do'' have in common, and told them,
``They get easier to pick up as they get older.''
   Since Rakolta wrote them, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., McDonald's Corp.,
Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Tambrands Inc. have told their advertising
agencies not to buy time on the program. The president of Coca-Cola
USA, Ira Herbert, said his company will screen future episodes more
closely.
   ``I must tell you that I am corporately, professionally, and
personally embarrassed that one of our commercials appeared in this
particularly unsuitable program episode,'' Herbert wrote Rakolta.
   Fox officials defended the show. The Bundy family is ``a comedic
counterpoint to other fictional television families who enjoy above
average incomes, greater opportunities and have more refined
tastes,'' wrote Don R. Bay, a Fox vice president.
   Some episodes in the parody of life ``in a lower socioeconomic
family'' may offend some viewers, wrote Gary Lieberthal, chairman of
its producer, Columbia Pictures Television _ whose parent company is
owned by Coca-Cola Co. ``Hopefully, many people (though we know not
all) will be entertained by the outrageously absurd lives and
off-center values of the Bundy family.''
   Rakolta said she didn't see the humor. ``They're exploiting
women. They're stereotyping poor people,'' she said.

<HEAD>Whittle Reports No Advertiser Defections From TV News Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The architect of a plan to send commercials along
with a news show into classrooms says advertisers backing a test run
of the program are standing firm despite growing criticism of the
proposal.
   Christopher Whittle, head of Whittle Communications LP of
Knoxville, Tenn., said eight sponsors have signed contracts to buy
80 percent of the commercial time available during the test that
starts Monday.
   ``No one who has signed has even called and said they were
worried,'' he said Thursday in response to reports that a second
major education group has gone on record opposing commercials in
school.
   Whittle refused to identify the eight sponsors, saying it would
become evident who they are once the test run starts in six schools
on March 6.
   As part of the test, Whittle has equipped six schools with about
$50,000 each in television monitors, recording equipment and
sattellite dishes so they can receive the 12-minute daily news show
he is producing for teen-agers.
   The schools, in exchange, are to run the show each school day.
   The show, called Channel One, will include two minutes of paid
commercials. The advertising has outraged some educators, who say
big business should not be allowed that kind of access to the
classroom.
   The National Parent-Teacher Association said Wednesday that its
22-member executive committee opposed sending commercials into the
schools. Earlier this week, the National Association of Secondary
School Principals voted to urge principals to avoid programs that
have commercials.
   Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the San Francisco-based apparel maker, is one
of the sponsors of the test, but Levi's marketing manager, Dan Chew,
said the uproar hasn't prompted the company to reconsider its
support.
   ``We are very sensitive to the public debate and we are
monitoring it and listening as closely as anyone else,'' he said.
   But he said that public reaction to the idea of including ads on
a news show for schools is only one issue on ``a long list of
criteria'' for making a decision on whether to continue advertising
on the show if Whittle proceeds with plans to make it available next
year in 8,000 schools.
   Whittle said many schools would not be able to afford a topical,
daily news program like he is producing or the hardware. He says
allowing two minutes of commercials is a reasonable way to finance
it.
   He said his company has made presentations to 15 advertisers
seeking their support for the program and that only three, whom he
declined to identify, have declined.
   In addition to the eight that signed contracts, he said he is
continuing negotations with four others and is hopeful that two of
three of them will buy the remaining commercial inventory.
   Lou Nagy, spokesman for sneaker maker Converse Inc. in North
Reading, Mass., said Converse isn't interested in being a sponsor,
though it counts on the teen-age consumers that Whittle is courting.
   ``Our feeling is that there are plenty of opportunities to reach
the teen-age audience and we just feel that doing it in the
classroom is maybe overdoing it a little bit,'' he said.
   In another development Thursday, Whittle said it had reached an
agreement to send non-sponsored programming to the test schools from
the Pacific Mountain Network, which represents public television
stations in 13 western states.
   An unspecified number of programs will be delivered over the same
satellite system that carries the Channel One program, and schools
are free to use the shows as they choose.
   Whittle already publishes a number of magazines and sponsored
posters that are distributed in schools across the country, and he
notes that the advertising in those publications has not come under
fire.
   But critics say a sponsored television show that is being shown
in classrooms will be more difficult than other media for students
to ignore.

<TEXT>
   Chairman Samuel J. Heyman's buyout offer for
GAF Corp., once a casualty of the stock market crash, ended 18
months after it was launched when shareholders accepted the $1.46
billion bid.
   GAF told shareholders at a brief annual meeting Thursday that 94
percent of the shares for which votes were submitted approved the
acquisition by a management group headed by Heyman.
   The deal will likely be made final in two weeks when financing
arrangements are completed, GAF said.
   Stockholders will receive $46 in cash and an estimated $7 worth
of subordinated debentures for each share. The transaction is backed
by $885 million in bank loans led by Chase Manhattan Bank and $285
million in high-yield ``junk'' bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   Heyman and management group members are investing $100 million
through the purchase of senior subordinated increasing rate notes.
   A maker of specialty chemicals and building materials, GAF in
1988 earned $90.8 million, or $3.18 a share, before extraordinary
credits, on revenues of $961.4 million.
   As the announcement was made, the trial of GAF and Vice Chairman
James T. Sherwin continued in federal court in Manhattan with the
second day of the defense presentation.
   The government accuses GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin with
illegally trying to manipulate Union Carbide Corp. stock before GAF
planned to sell Carbide shares in 1986.
   ``We are extremely gratified by the outcome of the shareholder
vote,'' Heyman said in a statement. ``It clearly demonstrates the
success of a process which was designed from the outset to realize
for shareholders the highest current value for their ownership
interest in the company.''
   Heyman's first offer came in September 1987. It was valued at
$2.3 billion, or $66.50 a share, and was withdrawn after the Oct.
19, 1987, crash, after which GAF shares traded at a low of $31.50.
   The following December, stockholders were offered $48.50 a share
and the bid was sweetened last year to its current $53 a share.
   One analyst said the new ownership will have to do something to
pay for the purchase.
   ``One thing is very clear: cash flow from the current operations
cannot pay down the debt,'' said Charles J. Rose of Oppenheirmer &amp;
Co.
   ``It's hard for me to imagine any assets being sold,'' he said.
``Maybe there's a lot more of earnings potential to be realized.''
   He also said Heyman may seek acquisitions.

<HEAD>Racy TV Show Loses Several Major Advertisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defection of several advertisers from the
television comedy ``Married... With Children'' highlights concern
among image-conscious corporations over TV's increasingly racy fare,
some industry insiders said.
   Two major advertisers quit buying time on the Fox Broadcasting
Co. situation comedy. Others have spurned selected episodes for fear
the show's frank language and references to sex would offend
viewers, executives of the advertisers said Thursday.
   Advertising already is tough to find for ``tabloid TV'' programs
such as ``Geraldo'' that delve into kinky sex, devil worship and
similarly salacious subjects, advertising executives say.
   Some defectors from ``Married,'' which is the fledgling Fox's
top-rated show, were influenced by an energetic letter-writing
campaign by a Detroit-area mother, Terry Rakolta, spokesmen said.
   The show, about a blue-collar family named Bundy, features
references to sex and bathroom humor, buxom women and frequent
portrayals of the husband berating his wife.
   Two advertisers, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and American Home Products
Corp., bought some ads on the show but have decided against further
sponsorship, spokesmen said Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson and
McDonald's Corp. officials said they had decided against running
national advertising on the show, though individual, locally
purchased ads for the two had run.
   Coca-Cola USA, whose president, Ira Herbert, wrote an apology to
Mrs. Rakolta, continues to screen ``Married'' episodes for content,
but hasn't found one suitable for advertising since her complaint
Jan. 15, said spokesman Tony Tortorici.
   Advertisers' concerns were summed up by Procter &amp; Gamble
spokeswoman Kelly Gillespie: ``We felt that the whole theme of the
show is basically one we do not want to be associated with. We were
concerned about the negative portrayal of American family life.''
   Fox, which purposefully appeals to the young adult audiences
advertisers covet in its efforts to build a fourth television
network, hasn't had any trouble selling ads on the show, which is
broadcast Sunday evenings, said spokesman Brad Turell.
   ``The show is completely sold out,'' he said, adding that news
reports of Mrs. Rakolta's campaign prompted calls of support from
viewers.
   ``We have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today
from across the country from viewers saying that this one woman's
opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we won't
change the show,'' Turell said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes hundreds of household products,
bought ads on several ``Married'' episodes last year, stopped from
October through December then sponsored two shows in January, Ms.
Gillespie said. After receiving Mrs. Rakolta's letter, officials
reviewed the show and decided against further ads, she said.
   American Home Products, which makes goods ranging from Jiffy Pop
to Woolite, had already decided to disassociate itself from the show
before receiving Mrs. Rakolta's letter, said spokeswoman Carol
Emerling in New York.
   Tambrands, which produces feminine hygiene products such as
Tampax, planned to advertise on two ``Married'' episodes but
canceled the second after a review prompted by Mrs. Rakolta's
letters, said Paul Konney, a spokesman in the company's New York
headquarters.
   Advertisers face a dilemma in deciding whether to sponsor racy
shows, which often attract big audiences but may offend some vocal
consumers.
   So-called tabloid TV shows like ``Geraldo'' have difficulty
attracting advertisers because of what many see as their
exploitation of the weaker side of humanity.
   A recent survey of advertisers and ad buyers found resistance to
such shows, topped by the often-outrageous ``The Morton Downey Jr.''
talk show, said Dean McCarthy, vice president of Harrington, Righter
&amp; Parsons, a New York firm that helps television stations sell air
time.
   Virtually all big companies have guidelines for what kind of
shows are acceptable for their ads, and most hire screening
companies to check shows in advance for problems.
   As television presses the outer limits of taste _ boosted by more
lenient federal regulations and greater competition for ads with
other media _ finding an appropriate spot for an ad be difficult,
said McDonald's spokeswoman Stephanie Skurdy.
   ``Ours is a children's and family business,'' Ms. Skurdy said
from the company's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters. ``It has become
increasingly difficult to find family programming on prime-time
television.''
   But Paul Isaacson, vice president of Young &amp; Rubicam, a New York
advertising agency, said complaints about shows' content didn't
appear any more frequent now than they ever have.
   Those who seek to influence television content through pressure
on advertisers are attempting censorship, said Carol Sobel, an
American Civil Liberties Union attorney.
   ``If you don't want to watch it then don't watch it,'' Ms. Sobel
said. ``I think what is inappropriate is to force your views on
anyone else.''

<HEAD>Higher Rates To Restrain Spending But Retailers Unlikely To Suffer
Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economists say rising interest rates have started
to influence people's spending decisions, but purchases of clothing
and other everday items will be among the last things affected.
   There was no evidence of a slowdown in consumer spending in
reports Thursday from the nation's largest retailers, which showed
many of them enjoyed healthy sales gains in February.
   A continuing turnaround in women's apparel and renewed demand for
other consumer and household goods contributed to last month's gains
for department stores, discount chains and general merchandise
vendors.
   Retail sales measure important aspects of consumer spending
activity, which accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. economic
activity.
   Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at the investment banking firm
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said the recent rise in interest rates, partly
reflecting the Federal Reserve Board's effort to squeeze
inflationary pressures, may be changing people's minds about
spending.
   ``I think we are already in the early stages of a slowdown in
consumer spending,'' Kudlow said. ``You are seeing a higher savings
rate, which is the flip side of slower spending.''
   Higher interest rates will have the most impact on purchases
typically financed over time, such as cars and home appliances.
Jeffrey Feiner, a retail industry analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
said the effect on sales of clothing and routine items will be much
more limited.
   ``We still remain relatively sanguine about the retailing
outlook, given the improvement in women's apparel as well as our
belief that retailers will maintain very strong control over
inventories and expenses,'' he said.
   For many of the retailers, February marked the start of their
1989 financial year. Balance sheets showed signs of improvement last
year, analysts said, due largely to unexpectedly brisk business
before and after Christmas.
   February typically is a low-volume month as merchants prepare for
a seasonal shopping pickup in the spring. But analysts detected
favorable omens in the latest tallies.
   One good sign was stronger sales of apparel, apparently because
women are finding the latest styles more appealing than last year's
fashions.
   Limited Inc., the apparel retailer, said sales rose 22 percent in
the four weeks ended Feb. 25 from the year before and sales at
stores open at least a year _ called same-store sales _ went up by
19 percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts say same-store sales give a more
accurate reading of a company's performance than totals that include
sales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports same-store
sales.
   At Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, sales
of sporting goods, toys and auto accessories posted strong gains,
said Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears
Merchandise Group.
   Sears, which on Wednesday inaugurated a new low-pricing policy at
all of its more than 800 stores, said sales for the four weeks ended
Feb. 25 went up 13.2 percent from the year-earlier level and
same-store sales rose 6.6 percent.
   K mart Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph E. Antonini said sales
of small appliances, home electronics and items in its pharmacy
division contributed to overall sales growth.
   K mart's sales for the four weeks ended Feb. 22 grew 8.3 percent
and sales at stores open a year or more were up by 3.5 percent.
   William R. Howell, chairman of J.C. Penney Co. Inc., said
promotions for Valentine's Day and President's Day boosted sales,
particularly for men's merchandise and home furnishings.
   Penney said sales in the four weeks ended Feb. 25 increased 5.3
percent and same-store sales gained 2.5 percent. The company has
discontinued lines such as home electronics, some sporting goods and
photographic equipment over the year and, excluding those lines,
sales for February rose 9.8 percent.
   Among other retailers reporting Thursday:
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the fast-growing discount and general
merchandise chain based in Bentonville, Ark., recorded a 25 percent
sales rise in February. Same-store sales rose 11 percent.
   Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. said sales for the four
weeks ended Feb. 25 were up 11 percent over the year and same-store
sales rose 4.7 percent.
   The results reported Thursday were from most of the biggest
general merchandise chains and apparel retailers, excluding Campeau
Corp., R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and Batus Inc., which do not release monthly
figures. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal
government, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets
or restaurants.

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnetonka Corp., maker of Calvin Klein
cosmetics, says it may offer itself for sale to maximize value for
its shareholders.
   ``Comparable high-margin, luxury product businesses are
commanding very high values in the private market,'' said Robert R.
Taylor, Minnetonka's chairman, chief executive officer and largest
individual shareholder.
   ``This underscores our belief that it is in the best interests of
our shareholders to explore the sale of the company,'' he said in a
statement Thursday.
   Taylor said Minnetonka, which designs, manufactures and markets
international lines of fragrance, personal care and leather
accessory products, has retained Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. as its
financial adviser to explore a possible sale and other alternatives
to benefit shareholders.
   Minnetonka on Wednesday reported a 1988 profit from continuing
operations of $15.8 million, up 56 percent from the $10.1 million of
1987. Earnings per share from continuing operations were 94 cents,
up 65 percent from 57 cents the previous year.
   Sales for the year rose 40 percent to $213.5 million, from $152.4
million in 1987.
   The company said its Calvin Klein cosmetics division accounted
for $157.7 million of total sales, up 52 percent from 1987, and had
a 66 percent increase in operating income to $27.7 million.
   ``The Calvin Klein cosmetics division has become the leading
contributor to Minnetonka's financial performance and has
consistently delivered exceptional growth and profitability,''
Taylor said.
   Minnetonka's 1988 results included the launching of its Calvin
Klein fragrance ``Eternity,'' which Taylor predicted could match the
success of Minnetonka's ``Obsession'' fragrance. Both sell for
around $185 an ounce.
   Sales figures for ``Obsession'' and ``Eternity'' are not
available, said Elin Schomaker, a spokeswoman for the company.
   Taylor said the announcement that Minnetonka is considering the
possibility of a sale does not guarantee ``that this exploration
will result in proposals acceptable to the company or that any
transaction will be consummated.''
   ``We believe there is a significant gap between (Minnetonka's)
current share price level and the value that could be achieved in
the private market,'' Taylor said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar held against most major currencies
today, though some traders believed its recent rally was running out
of steam.
   Gold prices rose.
   One trader in Milan said the dollar's room for upward movement is
limited by the continued worries about the health of the U.S.
economy.
   ``There are still too many fundamentals that are weak in the
U.S.,'' the trader said. Nonetheless, ``I'm not going to be selling
dollars soon.''
   Another trader in Milan said that if the U.S. Senate rejects
President Bush's choice of John Tower as secretary of defense, the
dollar would likely lose ground.
   ``The market generally likes a strong American president. But if
Tower's candidacy fails, the `wimp factor' will re-emerge,'' the
trader said.
   The pound sank in London to $1.7205 from $1.7270 late Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.05 Japanese yen to a closing 128.12 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 128.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8443 West German marks, up from 1.8405; 1.5775
Swiss francs, up from 1.5710; 6.2740 French francs, up from 6.2575;
2.0831 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0735; 1,357.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,360.50; 1.1935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1945.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $384.30 a troy ounce, up
from $383.75 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $386.50.
   In Zurich, gold was trading at $386.50 at noon, compared with
$383.25 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 86 cents an ounce to close at a
bid $386.75.
   Gold dealers in London said the market appeared to be ignoring
the dollar, while the metal gained strength from some short covering
and buying interest out of Japan and Switzerland.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $5.80 a troy
ounce, up from $5.76 late Thursday.

   The U.S. dollar held its ground against the Japanese
yen at the end of trading today, while share prices toppled sharply
from earlier highs to finish the week marginally lower.
   The U.S. dollar finished at 128.12 yen, up only 0.05 yen from
Thursday's 128.07 close. It had started trading at 128.58 yen and
moved mainly between 128.10-128.70 yen during the day.
   Dealers said the dollar was mainly supported by a West German
decision Thursday not to change its interest rates.
   Bundesbank, the West German central bank, said it would maintain
its discount rate and its Lombard interest rate at 4.0 percent and
6.0 percent, respectively.
   ``Because of the announcement, the dollar managed to touch 128.70
yen during the morning session, but fell back in afternoon
trading,'' said a dealer with a major Japanese securities firm.
   He said a speech by Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita in the
afternoon erased gains made by the U.S. currency, causing it to drop
to 128.12 yen.
   In the speech to businessmen, Sumita said the domestic price
situation is becoming ``more severe'' when compared to last year,
and that it was important to act ``promptly and flexibly'' to deter
inflationary fear.
   ``Market participants took that to mean Japan may hike its own
interest rates,'' the dealer said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Japan's discount rate presently stands at 2.5 percent, the lowest
among major industrialized countries.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei index also fell from
earlier gains to close the week marginally lower at 32,000.10
points, down 73.63 points, or 0.22 percent.
   It had started trading with a strong 226.34-point gain, but lost
steam because of profit-taking by cautious investors.

<HEAD>IRS Softening Health Plan Anti-Discrimination Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The IRS is temporarily softening the sting of a
new law affecting the group health insurance of many American
workers, but opponents say the only solution is repeal.
   A bill to kill the law, which requires businesses to demonstrate
that their health plans do not discriminate in favor of upper-income
employees, has been signed by 183 members of the House.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Small Business
Committee, says he expects a majority of the House _ 218 members _
to have signed his repeal bill within a few weeks.
   One employee-benefits consultant estimates that almost half the
nation's companies with more than 1,000 workers cannot say with
certainty that their plans do not discriminate.
   The Internal Revenue Service on Thursday issued 220 pages of
regulations explaining to employers how they could comply with the
law, which is known as Section 89. The law was enacted as part of
the big tax overhaul of 1986 and amended as recently as last
November.
   Although the law took effect Jan. 1, the IRS said employers need
take no action to comply with it before July 1. In addition, a
good-faith effort to comply will be treated by the IRS as having
satisfied the law at least until next Jan. 1.
   Business representatives said the regulations do nothing to make
th law more attractive.
   ``Section 89 represents a major attack on our employee benefit
system,'' said Karen Berg, human-resources manager for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. ``In reality, it's a back-door effort to tax
employee benefits. The length and complexity of the regulations make
it clear that Section 89 should be repealed.''
   ``It is obvious that they have failed to provide understandable
guidance for Section 89,'' said John Sloan Jr., president of the
National Federation of Independent Business.
   Congress enacted Section 89 in an effort to extend health
insurance to more workers. The provision requires employers to apply
complex mathematical tests to their benefits packages to prove that
they are not biased against workers making less than $50,000 a year.
   Many businesses complain that the law, by weighting them down
with paperwork, could have the opposite effect by encouraging
abandonment of employee health insurance.
   Treasury and IRS officials say their discussions with accountants
indicate most businesses will have no major problem complying with
the law. In large part, that assumption reflects that the general
principles applying to health and welfare benefits are similar to
those that have governed employee pensions since 1974.
   The regulations announced Thursday, on which the IRS will take
comments until May 8, apply chiefly to health insurance, since that
is the benefit affecting most employers. However, the transition
rules, including the date changes, also apply to term life insurance.
   Under the law, before an employer's benefit plan can be
considered qualified by the IRS, it must be written, enforceable,
permanent and maintained exclusively for the benefit of workers. If
a plan is not qualified, all employees pay tax on the benefit.
   A second set of requirements is designed to prevent the plan from
being overly beneficial to higher-income workers. If an employer's
plan fails this test, only the highly paid employees _ not
rank-and-file workers _ would have to pay tax on the value of the
excess insurance coverage.
   In explaining the regulations, the IRS scoffed at a story
repeated often by opponents of Section 89. This story holds that a
hypothetical $20,000-a-year janitor whose $150,000 heart surgery is
covered by insurance would have to pay tax on the full $150,000 if
his employer's health plan failed to meet qualification rules.
   ``That result is not reached under these regulations,'' said
James J. McGovern, IRS assistant chief counsel.
   The regulations state that if a plan does not qualify, a worker
making under $50,001 would be liable for tax on only 10 percent of
medical expenses that were reimbursed under the insurance plan. The
percentage would rise with income; a worker earning over $150,000
would pay tax on the full reimbursement.
   The IRS said no penalty would be imposed for a small violation
that was corrected within 90 days.

<TEXT>
   The economy is likely to continue its record
peacetime expansion during 1989 but the pace of growth is expected
to slow this year under the weight of rising interest rates, many
analysts believe.
   While President Bush is pinning his budget and deficit-reductions
plans on optimistic assumptions for a 3.2 percent rate of economic
growth during 1989, many private forecasters expect the pace to be
closer to 2.7 percent.
   The gross national product, the broadest measure of economic
health, grew a robust 3.8 percent during 1988, but the pace fell to
2 percent in the final three months of the year.
   Most economists said 1989 opened on a strong note but that growth
should slow as the economy responds to a yearlong campaign by the
Federal Reserve Board to push up interest rates and cool the economy
to restrain inflation.
   The government's main forecasting gauge of future economic
activity, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, was expected to
show an increase for January. The report was scheduled to be
released today.
   ``Growth will be very robust this quarter, but starting next
quarter, I fully expect to see the effects of the higher interest
rates,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm.
   William Dunkelberg, dean of the School of Business and Management
at Temple University, said economic reports so far this year give
``no indication that the economy is going to weaken substantially in
the next half-year.''
   The Fed last week intensified its anti-inflation fight, boosting
its key bank lending rate a half-percentage point to 7 percent, in
an effort to rein in accelerating inflation. At the same time, major
banks boosted their prime rate, charged to their most creditworthy
commercial customers, by a half-point to 11 percent, the second
increase in two weeks.
   The Fed's latest round of credit-tightening came as concerns
about inflation had heightened with word that consumer prices rose
0.6 percent in January and wholesale prices rose 1 percent.
   Today's release of the leading index marks its first issue in a
revised format.
   The revisions dropped two of 11 components from the index,
revised two others, and added two new indicators of economic
activity.
   Using data stretching back to 1948, the composite index has
correctly predicted all eight recessions by dropping for at least
three months in a row, but it also forecast four recessions that
never materialized.
   Larry Moran, a spokesman for the government's Bureau of Economic
Analysis, said Thursday the changes make the index less prone to
after-the-fact revision, less apt to make false predictions of
future downturns and more precise at predicting when downturns will
occur.
   A bureau study of how the new index would have done if it had
been used in the past showed that its performance would have been
similar to that of the old index.
   The two new indicators are a University of Michigan survey of
consumer optimism and the measure evaluating manufacturers' unfilled
orders.
   The components that were dropped _ changes in outstanding credit
and the change in inventories on hand and on order _ were scrapped
mainly because up-to-date data has not been available when the index
first was compiled for a particular month. The index for that month
was later revised to include the updated information.

<HEAD>Mexico To Reduce Crude Exports 5 Percent On April 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Mexico announced Friday it is reducing crude
oil exports by 5 percent beginning April 1 in a coordinated move
with other producers in an effort to buttress prices on the world
market.
   Crude exports will be cut by an average of 68,600 barrels a day
from the current average of 1.37 million, the Department of Energy
and Mines said in a statement.
   ``With this, Mexico fully acknowledges that strengthening the oil
market is a joint responsibility by producers and consumers, since
everyone benefits from a stable market and (fair) prices,'' it said.
   The statement did not give a time frame for the reduction but a
source at Pemex, the state petroleum monopoly, said the cut will
probably be maintained at least until the end of the year, depending
on world market conditions.
   The cut was tentatively agreed upon Feb. 21 at a conference by
Mexico _ the world's fourth biggest producer and sixth largest
exporter _ and the five other non-OPEC producers in London. Two
weeks of consultations and negotiations followed on the details.
   At the London conference, Mexico proposed to cut exports by 5
percent provided the other non-OPEC nations did the same. The
agreement came after the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed to cut exports during a meeting in
Vienna, Austria.
   Participating in the talks at the Mexican Embassy in London were
Mexico, Oman, Malaysia, Egypt, China and Angola. The Soviet Union,
Colombia, North Yemen, Norway and the state of Alaska and the
Canadian province of Alberta sent observers.
   Although Mexico refuses to join OPEC, it has often used the
international cartel's guidelines to set prices and export limits.
   OPEC members Alberia, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela together were estimated to be producing in
February about 19.5 million barrels a day.
   This was 1 million above their agreed production limit but well
below their fourth-quarter production last year. OPEC has set a
target price of $18 a barrel for the second quarter of this year.
   Mexico's production averages 2.5 million barrels a day, and about
half of it is exported to the United States. Japan, its principal
customer in the Far East, buys about 180,000 barrels daily. Mexico
also imports 56,000 barrels a day from the United States for its
northern border region to save transportation costs.
   On Wednesday, Mexico reduced prices of its light Isthmus to
Western Europe and the United States, and its extra-light Olmec to
the United States by 10 cents a barrel, but kept the price of its
heavy Maya crude unchanged.
   Olmec, which Mexico began producing in mid-1988, is sold only to
the United States.
   Pemex establishes its prices by region, using a formula based on
average prices on so-called world ``spot'' markets, where oil is
auctioned to the highest bidder. But it sells only to fast customers
under contract of one year or more.
   Thus, the price of Maya to the U.S. averaged $12.38 a barrels
during the first half of January, while Isthmus averaged $15.86 and
Olmec $16.80. In Western Europe, Maya averaged $11.52 and Isthmus
$15.71 a barrel and in the Far East Maya averaged $12.20 and Isthmus
$14.85, according to Pemex figures.

<HEAD>CBOT Seeks Greater Accountability After Targeting by Federal Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade, whose trading is under
federal investigation, Friday announced measures to provide greater
accountability and a better audit trail of floor trades.
   The Board of Trade's board of directors unanimously approved
implementation of nine ``enhancements'' of the exchange's
surveillance system, said spokeswoman Jane Crowley.
   The measures were approved after disclosure last month of a
2-year undercover federal probe into suspected illegal trading
practices at the BOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. No
indictments have yet been announced as a result of the ongoing
investigation, in which FBI agents have posed as traders to look
into allegations of pre-arranged trades and other illegal practices.
   ``The timing, obviously, has some ties to the investigation,''
said a Board of Trade official who asked not to be identified. ``But
they (Board of Trade directors) have been making changes to improve
the system since it went in three years ago.''
   Crowley said most of the measures involve changes in the
time-reporting system.
   Traders record trades within 30-minute windows on cards that are
collected at 10:30 a.m. CST and again at the close of business in
each trading pit.
   The new measures would double the number of windows, make them
15-minute sessions, and require collection of traders' cards hourly.
   Finally, the clocks of all brokerage houses operating at the
exchange would be sychronized with the Board of Trade's floor clock,
ensuring greater uniformity in time-stamping trades.
   In another development, both the Board of Trade and the Merc have
asked member traders not to respond to a Wall Street Journal survey
requesting opinions on the federal probe.
   Merc officials sent out a five-page letter urging members to
beware of the ``deviously phrased'' survey. The letter also cites
``defects'' in 10 of the survey's 12 questions that Merc officials
said are calculated to produce a ``distorted story.''
   Board of Trade officials, meanwhile, told members that any survey
responses ``may undermine our efforts to reinforce investor
confidence in the integrity of our markets.''
   The survey asked traders for their opinions on FBI tactics, on
whether there was cheating at the exchanges and to what extent, and
the effectiveness of internal disciplinary actions.
   A spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Journal called
the survey a ``standard reporting technique.''

<HEAD>Chrysler Slow To Pay Settlement In Odometer Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s delay in mailing settlement
checks in a disconnected odometer case has cost the automaker loyal
customers, some consumers said.
   The automaker negotiated the settlement with officials in 45
states more than 14 months ago. The agreement came after a federal
grand jury charged two company employees with conspiring to sell
more than 60,000 vehicles whose odometers were disconnected while
they were driven by Chrysler officials.
   Consumers who bought the vehicles were supposed to receive $500
each, but the checks never went in the mail.
   ``If they had sent me the $500 I probably would have gone right
out and bought another Chrysler,'' Doris Smith of Grosse Pointe
said. ``But my husband went out and bought a Sterling and it runs
like a dream. They lost a longtime customer.''
   Many consumers say they haven't even received a claim form that
they were told last August would be mailed to them shortly
thereafter, the Detroit Free Press said Friday.
   ```Shortly thereafter' in court terms can mean anywhere from one
to two years,'' said Marcia Darling-Aud, a court employee at U.S.
District Court in St. Louis.
   The biggest problem at the moment is identifying all those
entitled to receive the settlement checks, Darling-Aud said.
   She added the money is sitting in a St. Louis bank collecting
interest. That means the eventual settlement may be more than $500,
Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said.

   Imasco Ltd. said Friday it has agreed to sell
114 stores in its Peoples Drug Store chain, mostly in Ohio, to Rite
Aid Corp.
   No financial details of the transaction were disclosed.
   Peoples, which is based in Alexandria, Va., operates 745 stores
in 11 states and the District of Columbia. The company is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Imasco, which is headquartered in Montreal.
   Imasco announced in January that it would sell about 240 Peoples
stores in Indiana and Ohio. It has also announced the sale of 80
stores in Peoples' Atlanta division.
   Rite Aid, located in Harrisburg, Pa., operates 2,200 stores,
mainly in the East.
   The latest deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is
expected to close in mid-April, according to a statement from Imasco
Limited, the parent company of Peoples Drug.
   Once the sales are completed, Peoples will have about 500 stores
in the Washington, D.C., area, the mid-Atlantic region and
Pennsylvania.
   Imasco is a major Canadian consumer products and services
company, whose operations include Hardee's fast food restaurants,
Shoppers Drug Mart, and Imperial Tobacco.

<HEAD>Grain Futures End Mostly Lower; Corn Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat, oats and soybean futures prices closed
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade but corn finished mixed
in response to a lower-than-expected forecast for Argentine corn
production.
   In a day of subdued trading, most of the selling was attributed
to pre-weekend profit-taking after Thursday's steep rally in the
soybean market, which raised prices to a 4-week high.
   Crop futures also were pressured by reports of widespread
precipitation in the Midwest and the Plains, and by forecasts for
more snow and rain during the weekend.
   The precipitation will help recharge soil parched by last
summer's drought and provide protective snow cover for some of the
winter wheat crop.
   Support for the corn market stemmed from the Argentine National
Grain Board's estimate Thursday of a 4.77 million-metric-ton corn
harvest this spring.
   The estimate compares with last year's harvest of 8.88 million
metric tons. The crop suffered heavy drought damage, effectively
eliminating Argentina as a major corn exporter during the 1989-90
crop year.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 3} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.32{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to 2} cents higher with March at $2.78\ a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 4{ cents lower with March at $2.05{ a bushel; soybeans were

   The stock market showed some scattered gains
today in an indecisive session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.04 to 2,273.75 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 780 up, 587 down and
524 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in January, in line with
advance estimates on the Street.
   The figures elicited no strong response from the bond market,
where prices were mixed.
   In the absence of any stimulus from that direction, brokers said,
money managers at investing institutions continued some selective
buying of stocks in the hopes of showing good results when they make
their first-quarter reports to clients at the end of this month.
   But otherwise, traders seemed reluctant to make any big
commitments.
   TW Services fell ~ to 27. A Delaware court upheld the ``poison
pill'' defense the company is employing to fight a takeover bid by
Coniston Partners.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Texaco rose { to 53; Union
Carbide gained 1\ to 31~; American Express rose \ to 30\, and Exxon
was unchanged at 44[.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage preferred shares picked up ~ to 53. A

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.50 to 163.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.06 at 326.01.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 121.96 million shares with an

   The anxiety of passengers and Eastern Airlines
employees was evident Friday at Eastern terminals and in the air as
the midnight deadline loomed for a strike against the ailing carrier.
   Operations seemed to be running normally at Eastern's terminal at
LaGuardia Airport in New York and there was no evidence of
additional police presence Friday morning.
   But bitter employees were vocal about Eastern management and
pessimistic about the prospects for a last-minute settlement of the
dispute between Eastern and its Machinists union.
   ``There's tremendous anger'' at Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., said a male flight attendant
onboard an early morning run from New York to Miami.
   ``I would rather see the airline burn to the ground'' than have
it continue under current management, said the employee from Queens,
N.Y., who has worked for Eastern for 11 years.
   The New York-Miami flight, which had been overbooked, was delayed
nearly an hour while flight attendants offered free round-trip
tickets on Eastern to passengers willing to give up their seats.
There were few takers, but precious minutes went by as the gamblers
left the aircraft and seats were found for the passengers replacing
them.
   At the terminal, Florida-bound passengers worried about getting
back to New York quizzed ticket agents _ some of whom, at least,
seemed to be making an extra effort to be courteous and upbeat. The
check-in lines were fairly long but orderly and fast-moving.
   Lorenzo ``is in a class by himself,'' said one agent, who
reported she had been besieged by questions from passengers. She
expressed optimism, though, that an 11th-hour settlement could be
reached to avert a strike, as happened in 1986 when former Eastern
chairman Frank Borman sold the airline to Lorenzo.
   Some passengers joked about the hardship of not being able to get
back to New York when temperatures in Florida were running at around
80 degrees.
   But others were anxious.
   A young woman on the New York-Miami flight, due to take another
Eastern flight from Miami to San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Saturday was
worried that she and the 190-member tour group she was escorting
wouldn't make it.
   ``If the pilots go on strike (with the Eastern Machinists), this
airline is finished,'' she said. ``I'd hate to see another American
company go under; I would rather see their prices go up than a
company go under.''
   An Eastern pilot riding ``jump seat'' on the flight _ not working
but transiting to his next assignment _ insisted that a Machinists'
strike against Eastern can't be effective without the support of the
pilots. The pilots union at Eastern has balloted its members, but
the results haven't yet been announced.
   ``I don't think (Eastern management) has run the airline very
well,'' the 10-year pilot said.

   President Bush decided today to stay out of the
threatened Eastern Airlines strike, rejecting a National Mediation
Board recommendation and leaving the problem to company and
machinists' union negotiators who face a midnight deadline.
   Bush refused to use his authority under provisions of the Railway
Labor Act to appoint a presidential review panel to investigate the
labor strife _ a step that would have automatically delayed a strike
for 60 days.
   ``I have decided not to accept this recommendation,'' Bush said
in a statement released at mid-afternoon by the White House press
office.
   ``The National Mediation Board has for many months attempted
unsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement,'' Bush said,
``and I have no reason to believe that an additional investigation
or the 60-day delay that would be entailed would produce such an
agreement.''
   In light of the well-publicized threats of a strike and related
activities, he said, the Transportation Department ``will monitor
the situation and will, in addition, take whatever steps are needed
to protect the safety of the traveling public.''
   ``I urge responsible labor officials not to try to influence
resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nation's transportation
system through secondary boycotts against uninvolved parties,'' Bush
said. ``Such boycotts would unfairly burden millions of citizens,
not only affecting necessary travel but also affecting shipments of
consumer goods and the ability of workers to earn a living.''
   Bush noted that secondary boycotts are not permitted in other
areas of the economy. He said that if the Eastern Airlines dispute
threatens to disrupt essential transportation services, he will ask
Congress to pass legislation ``making it unlawful to use secondary
picketing and boycotts against neutral carriers.''
   ``We cannot allow an isolated labor-management dispute to disrupt
the nation's transportation system,'' the president said.
   Eastern, meanwhile, sent its machinists home this morning, citing
``significant amounts of vandalism,'' and saying the action was
intended to prevent sabotage in the hours before the strike
deadline. A federal court order allowed the action.
   Federal mediators, who were meeting with the negotiators at an
undisclosed Washington location, said the Eastern offer Thursday
brought hope of a settlement in the 17-month-old dispute.
   ``They likely will meet pretty much all day,'' said National
Mediation Board spokesman David Bushnell. ``I expect it will go
right up to the deadline if necessary.''
   Eastern's chief operating officer in Miami, Joe Leonard, said
machinists were given a paid holiday and told to return to work for
shifts starting at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, after the strike
deadline.
   ``This is not a lockout and is not an attempt to affect the
bargaining,'' Leonard said at a news conference. He said management
personnel would handle maintenance and other ground duties for the
rest of the day.
   Eastern pilots, rejecting an unusual videotaped offer by airline
owner Frank Lorenzo in separate contract negotiations, said Thursday
they would refuse to cross machinist picket lines.
   Other unions also pledged support in a plan to block work at
other airlines, railways and sea transport companies if a strike is
called by the 8,500-member Eastern local of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   A federal judge in Minnesota ordered against any sympathy strike
at Northwest Airlines, but the union was seeking orders in another
federal court here to allow such action.
   Bush met in the Oval Office for more than a half-hour with Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   The airline wanted Bush to stay out of it, saying it is losing $1
million a day and can't afford the delay. Eastern, owned by Texas
Air Corp., has pledged to keep operating if the machinists strike.
   The AFL-CIO and 33 senators led by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
had asked Bush to act.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said other union members should
honor the Eastern pickets wherever they are legally set up.
   Kirkland accused Lorenzo, who bought Texas Air in 1986, of
``finding it worth his while to purchase a good company and strip
its assets, rather than operate it fairly and decently.'' The union
accuses Lorenzo of planning to sell off Eastern assets or transfer
them to non-union Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air.
   Kirkland, asked after the Eastern offer what the chances of a
strike would be if Bush did not act, said, ``about a 100 percent
chance.''
   Kirkland and other union leaders, at a news conference, said they
doubted there would be any settlement because they believe Lorenzo
wants to dismantle the airline, which they said is worth about $500
million.
   The senators' letter, signed by 31 Democrats and GOP Sens.
Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said
60 U.S. cities in 27 states depend on Eastern for passenger and
freight service.
   ``Any interruption in this service will result in a major
disruption of interstate commerce,'' the letter said. Eastern flies
about 100,000 people a day with an average of 1,040 daily flights.
It has 250 airliners.
   The letter noted that no president has refused to act on a
mediation board recommendation to call a special panel in an airline
dispute.
   Other airlines contend their workers would be violating no-strike
clauses in their contracts if they honored picket lines set up by
Eastern strikers.
   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul
granted a temporary restraining order to prevent Northwest's
21,000-member machinist union from staging a sympathy strike. The
judge said the order ``is in the best interest of the public'' to
avoid disrupting flights.
   Union lawyers were asking U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt in
Washington to stop the airlines, including Northwest, from blocking
picketing of other companies which it says is allowed in a 1987
Supreme Court decision affecting transportation companies.
   Carol Perkins, spokeswoman for the Association of American
Railroads, said the group was calling on Congress to outlaw such
secondary picketing.
   W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, said the commuter
railroad would continue limited operations in the event of a
sympathy walkout in the face of Eastern picketing, but only for ``a
day or two.'' If there is no picketing and Eastern air service
stops, the railroad would add trains, he said.
   Eastern's machinists said the new company offer was an
improvement but still called for pay cuts rather than pay increases.
   Eastern originally wanted to cut salaries and get other
concessions from the union totaling $150 million. The union wanted
$50 million in raises.
   ``The company is still looking for major concessions, but it's
not $150 million,'' said union official Wally Haber in Miami after
the new offer.
   Eastern said the contract would reduce mechanics' pay but still
keep their salaries 13 percent higher than employees who took a 20
percent pay cut when Lorenzo took over the company in 1986. It said
baggage handlers' cuts would be no greater than those of other
employees.

<HEAD>Laura Ashley Says U.S. Retailer Copying Its Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laura Ashley Holdings PLC Friday charged U.S.
retailer Limited Inc. with copying the bottles and packaging design
of perfumes sold by a Laura Ashley subsidiary.
   A suit filed in federal court in New York by Laura Ashley and its
Penhaligon's Ltd. subsidiary seeks to stop Victoria's Secret shops
owned by Limited from selling perfumes in bottles and packaging
designs that allegedly are direct copies of ones used by
Penhaligon's.
   The complaint says Limited and Victoria's Secret produced the
knock-off line after they were unsuccessful in their attempts to
acquire Penhaligon's.
   Besides seeking to stop the manufacture and sale of the perfumes,
Laura Ashley is seeking an unspecified amount in monetary damages.
   A statement from Laura Ashley, which is a British company that
sells women's fashions, fabrics and some home furnishings, said the
suit was filed as a claim of unfair competition under the U.S.
trademark law and New York state law. Laura Ashley has been
expanding its U.S. presence in recent years.
   Penhaligon's, also based in Britain, has been in business since
the 1870s as a perfume retailer and was acquired by Laura Ashley in
1987.
   Its fragrance products are sold in about a dozen U.S. department
stores and to over 2,500 mail order customers. The statement said
Leslie H. Wexner, Limited's chairman, is one of the mail order
customers.
   Penhaligon's perfumes come in glass-stoppered bottles with an
unusual shape. The company has been awarded Royal Warrants from the
Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales and its perfume packaging
bears seals to reflect the endorsements.
   The suit claims Limited and Victoria's Secret have tried to
simulate the Royal Warrant on their perfume packaging.

   Car and truck sales by the nation's Big Three
automakers continued their 1989 skid in late February, falling 17.9
percent compared with the same period last year, the automakers
reported Friday.
   Chrysler Corp.'s car sales for late February were 30.7 percent
behind last year. General Motors Corp.'s were off 25.4 percent. Car
sales for Ford Motor Co. rose 0.4 percent during the Feb. 11-28
period.
   Truck sales by the Big Three fell 15.5 percent compared to the
same period last year, while car sales fell 19.3 percent.
   U.S.-made cars sold by GM, Ford and Chrysler sold at an average
daily rate of 26,062 during the period this year. That compares with
an average of 32,297 cars sold daily during the same period last
year.
   There were seven selling days during late February this year and
last year.
   Sales of light trucks made by the Big Three averaged 15,561 a day
in late February this year, compared with a daily rate of 18,419
during the same time last year.
   Combined, cars and trucks sold at a rate of 41,624 a day during
the period this year, compared with 50,716 in late February last
year.
   During January and February of last year, car and truck sales
were above average as strong incentives continued to draw buyers
into showrooms. Incentives are continuing but on a narrower range of
vehicles.
   For the year through February, the Big Three's car sales have
slipped 10.6 percent to a daily rate of 19,717 from a rate of 22,047
for the first two months of last year. Light truck sales dropped 1.9
percent during January and February of this year to a daily rate of
12,166 from a rate of 12,404 last year.
   There were 50 selling days during the first two months of this
year, one more than last year.
   Chrysler's car sales dropped a whopping 30.7 percent during late
February, falling to an average daily rate of 3,710 this year
compared with a rate of 5,354 last year. For the first two months of
the year, Chrysler has sold cars at a pace 18.4 percent below that
of 1988.
   On the truck side, Chrysler fared a little better, with late
February sales 1.3 percent below last year's rate. Truck sales for
the year to date by Chrysler are running 5.7 percent above last
year's pace.
   GM, the nation's largest automaker, said its car sales fell 25.4
percent in late February, dropping to a rate of 13,598 this year
from 18,221 last year. During the first two months of the year, GM's
car sales have slipped 14.6 percent.
   GM's truck sales, meanwhile, fell 29.2 percent during the period
this year compared with the same time last year. Through February,
sales of GM trucks are running 7.7 percent below last year's pace.
   Ford reported a 0.4 percent rise in car sales during late
February, going to a daily rate of 8,755 from 8,721 during the same
period last year. Through February of this year, Ford's car sales
have risen 0.5 percent.
   Truck sales for Ford in late February fell 5.3 percent compared
with the same period last year. Truck sales through February of this
year are 0.1 percent higher than they were during the first two
months of last year.

   The stock market posted some spotty gains today
in a quiet session.
   The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in January, in line with
advance estimates on the Street.
   The figures elicited no strong response from the bond market,
where prices were mixed.
   In the absence of any stimulus from that direction, brokers said,
money managers at investing institutions continued some selective
buying of stocks in the hopes of showing good results when they make
their first-quarter reports to clients at the end of this month.
   But otherwise, traders seemed reluctant to make any big

   Energy futures prices declined in volatile
trading Friday, with crude oil soaring toward the $19-a-barrel level
before settling lower in a wave of technical selling.
   Refined petroleum products also lost ground.
   ``It was a volatile day,'' said Peter Beutel, an energy analyst
with Elders Futures Inc.
   Beutel said prices started out weak following reports that
production among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
had been higher than expected during January and February.
   But he said the market started to rally later in the session
after non-OPEC nations Mexico, Egypt and the Soviet Union announced
5 percent cuts in their oil output.
   Several non-OPEC nations had agreed at a London conference last
month to cut oil production in coordination with an earlier
production pact between cartel members.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 16 cents lower
at $18.56 a barrel, after rising as high as $18.88 a barrel at one
point during Friday's session.
   Traders said prices declined in a wave of technical selling after
the WTI April contract failed to pierce the psychologically
important $19-a-barrel level.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
April contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 1.07 cents
lower at 50.80 cents a gallon. April unleaded gasoline settled at
51.53 cents, down 0.68 cent.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Four Launches Proxy Fight For Prime Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intensifying the battle to take over Prime Computer
Inc., MAI Basic Four Inc. said Friday it will wage a proxy fight for
control of Prime's board of directors at the May 12 annual meeting.
   MAI Basic announced a slate of nominees for the election, which
will fill all seven seats on the board by a majority vote of the
stockholders represented at the meeting.
   Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan said the announcement was ``not
unanticipated'' and that Prime will urge shareholders to retain the
current board.
   MAI Basic, a computer firm based in Tustin, Calif., launched a
$20-per-share hostile bid for Prime in mid-November. The offer is
valued at $970 million.
   In a prepared statement, MAI Basic said its slate of directors
would be committed to selling Prime, a manufacturer of minicomputers
and computer-aided design and manufacturing systems.
   Prime, which has headquarters in Natick, Mass., issued a response
saying MAI Basic's bid ``continues to be highly conditional,
unfinanced and extremely leveraged'' and that ``the price does not
reflect the intrinsic value of Prime.''
   MAI Basic's takeover offer has been enjoined since Dec. 9, when a
U.S. District Court judge in Boston ruled that MAI Basic had not
disclosed sufficient information about its financing arrangements
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   MAI Basic has appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of
Appeals.
   Bennett S. LeBow, chairman of MAI Basic, said in a prepared
statement that it ``would seriously consider raising its
$20-per-share, all-cash offer for all outstanding shares of Prime in
the context of a negotiated transaction in which (MAI Basic Four) is
provided information by Prime that demonstrates that such an
increase is warranted.''

<HEAD>Shrinking Timber Supply Puts Squeeze On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E.P. ``Bud'' Johnson shakes his head
when he looks at all the mature Douglas fir timber standing on
federal lands in the Northwest and thinks about how little he can
saw down.
   ``There have been years when we had fires or weather problems,
but nothing that has the long-range effect this has,'' said Johnson,
president of C&amp;D Lumber Co. in Riddle, Ore., and the fourth
generation of his family in the lumber business. ``There's a
tremendous resource out here. It's a shame we aren't using it more
completely.''
   Johnson likes to have two years' worth of timber under contract,
but can get only seven to eight months' worth.
   The people who run the lumber and plywood mills throughout the
Northwest are facing a problem that just a few years ago seemed
impossible: They are running out of trees to cut at a time when
demand is high.
   ``Business will probably be reasonably decent for those who can
get timber,'' said Eugene, Ore., timber consultant Paul F. Ehinger.
``What you are looking at is bankruptcies in the middle of
prosperity, because there is a good demand.''
   While a Portland State University study blames increased
productivity for more than half the timber jobs lost from 1976 to
1986, Ehinger blames timber supply for the closure of 22 sawmills
and 16 plywood mills in Oregon and Washington since the start of
1988.
   ``The simple fact is there is no timber around to run these
mills,'' he said. ``There are a lot of them on shaky ground today.''
   The squeeze is partly the result of an environmentalist battle to
save the last of the old-growth forests, a lag in the reforestation
of private lands and greater demand for raw logs overseas.
   As a result, average prices bid for Douglas fir on national
forests rose from $156.33 per thousand board feet in 1986 to $248.04
in 1988.
   In the past, private forests owned by big timber companies
accounted for the bulk of Northwest timber. They had first pick when
the land was up for grabs in the early 1900s, and the leftovers went
to the national forests.
   The private lands largely have been cut over and reseeded, but
the next generation of trees won't be ready for 20 to 50 years. That
focuses attention on public lands, particularly national forests,
where the best of the mature timber now stands.
   ``There are big clouds on the horizon and it's starting to
rain,'' said Jay Goldstein, spokesman for the Washington Forest
Protection Association in Olympia, Wash.
   ``As more and more federal lands are set aside for spotted owls
and other types of wildlife and recreation areas, the land available
for perpetual commercial timber management decreases.''
   The national forests in Washington and Oregon turned out 31
percent of the region's 15.2 billion board feet of raw timber in
1987.
   They are about to release management plans for the next 10 years
and the outlook is for less timber as they struggle to juggle the
demands of their multiple-use mandate.
   The 1980s management plan allowed the annual harvest of up to 5.5
billion board feet. The new plan will allow 4.7 billion board feet,
said Ron Johnson, a senior Forest Service administrator for the
Northwest.
   With more land reserved for wilderness and scenery, and foresters
getting a better idea of where trees grow best, the commercial
timber lands have shrunk from 17 million acres in 1978 to 14.5
million acres under the latest plans.
   ``We always had this thing of `Go west, young man,''' said
Johnson. ``Now we find there's a Pacific Ocean and we fell into it.
   ``What you see is what you've got. And everybody is scrambling to
get their piece of that.''
   Oregon's state forester, James Brown, predicts overall timber
supply will decline 10 percent by the year 2010. Ehinger foresees a
20 percent drop.
   From the environmentalists point of view, the shrinking timber
harvest is good both for the forest and the Northwest economy.
   ``Our timber industry has been scaled back to the ability of the
land to produce in the long term,'' said Andy Kerr of the Oregon
Natural Resources Council.

Friday in a quiet session.

   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in

   Lockheed Corp. stock jumped Friday after Business
Week reported rival aerospace giant Boeing Co. may try to buy the
company.
   The ``Inside Wall Street'' stock-tipping column in March 13
editions of the business newsweekly, published late Thursday and
available on newsstands next week, quoted unidentified sources as
saying Boeing is keenly interested in Lockheed's enormous defense
contracting business.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Lockheed rose $1.75 a share to
$49.50 in consolidated trading. Boeing rose $1.62{ to $65.12{.
   The column quoted an unidentified money manager as saying Boeing
can easily afford to buy Lockheed because it has $4.2 billion in
cash with little debt. Lockheed's market value at its current price
is about $3 billion, although a purchaser would likely have to pay
more to acquire the shares.
   The column also said Boeing's own military sales aren't expected
to grow this year, whereas Lockheed's have grown 30 percent annually
since 1982.
   Both companies declined to comment on takeover speculation.
   Lockheed, based in Calabasas, Calif., is a leader in research,
development and production of aerospace and defense products.
   Seattle-based Boeing also is deeply involved in defense-related
projects and is the undisputed leader in the commercial jetliner
industry.
   Lockheed ranked eighth in defense contracts in fiscal 1988, with
$3.54 billion, while Boeing ranked 10th with $3 billion, the
Pentagon said this week.
   Lockheed's stock also jumped late last year when Texas investor
Harold Simmons, through his majority-owned Valhi Inc., sought
clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to buy up to 15 percent
of Lockheed. Valhi so far has acquired less than 1 percent of the
stock.

   The dollar declined against several key
currencies in domestic dealings Friday after a mixed performance
overseas.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid
of $386.30 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, up from $383.50
late Thursday.
   Currency dealers described trading as trendless, with little news
to influence the dollar's movement. However, they said a sentiment
persisted among market participants that efforts to relieve
inflationary pressures, including increases in interest rates, may
affect exchange rates soon.
   ``The market was basically featureless the last few days,'' said
Kevin Laurie, manager of foreign exchange trading at the Bank of
Boston operation in New York. ``We're waiting for some information
to push the dollar out of the recent range.''
   In European currency markets, dealers said the Bank of England
bought sterling several times during the session in a bid to
maintain the British currency's exchange rate, but the action failed
to prevent a fall.
   The pound ended the London business day at $1.7240, cheaper for
buyers than Thursday's $1.7270 and its lowest level in London since
Oct. 11. But later, in New York, sterling fetched $1.72025, up from
$1.7125 in New York on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
levels, included: 1.8437 West German marks, down from 1.8474;
1.57515 Swiss francs, down from 1.5824; 1.19505 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.19485; 6.2645 French francs, down from 6.2880; and 1,358.00
Italian lire, down from 1,361.33.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Thursday's late rates were: 1.8415 West German marks, up from
1.8405; 1.5765 Swiss francs, up from 1.5710; 6.2600 French francs,
up from 6.2575; 2.0770 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0735; 1,358.75
Italian lire, down from 1,360.50; and, 1.1935 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1945.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.12 Japanese yen, up
from 128.07 yen late Thursday. In London late Friday the dollar was
trading lower, at 127.98 yen, and at 127.815 yen in New York, down
from 128.435 Thursday.
   Gold and silver prices gained.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $386.60 a troy ounce compared to $383.80 on
Thursday.
   The late bid price for gold in London was $386.25 a troy ounce,
up from $383.75. In Zurich, the late bid price was $386.30, up from
$383.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $386.75 bid, up from
$385.89.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.801 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $5.753.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.82 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.76.

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved
rule changes Thursday designed to give investors faster notice when
corporate auditors turn up fraud or other irregularities.
   Under the previous rules, a company had up to 15 days to report
the resignation of its auditor in a dispute and an additional 30
days after that to make public a letter from the auditor outlining
the disagreement.
   The new rule, approved on a 4-0 vote, requires companies to
report the resignation of an auditor within five days and to file
the auditor's letter with the SEC within 10 days, thus tightening up
the disclosure period from 45 days to 15 days.
   The changes come more than a year after members of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee complained about the rule during a
January 1988 hearing on the notorious ZZZZ Best fraud case.
   Barry Minkow, a teenage California financial wizard, parlayed a
rug-cleaning business based in his parents' garage into a
multimillion-dollar, publicly traded corporation.
   ZZZZ Best's independent auditor, Ernst &amp; Whinney, discovered
irregularities and resigned on June 2, 1986. But, the firm's
suspicions weren't made public until July 16, 1986. In the meantime,
unwitting investors continued to buy ZZZZ Best stock, which became
worthless.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., had been pressing for even faster
disclosure of irregularities turned up by accountants, by requiring
the accountants to go directly to the SEC with their suspicions.
   But, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told Wyden at a hearing last
year the commission lacked the power to require reports directly
from auditors. Ruder said he would support a change in the law
giving the commission that power.
   The commission plans to publish its new rules within several
weeks. They would become effective 30 days after that.
   SEC member Edward Fleischman expressed concern that the tightened
deadline would create a burden on firms, but the SEC staff said
there had been only about a half dozen cases within the past six
months that would have been affected.

<HEAD>Merc Signs French Futures Exchange to Globex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French futures exchange Marche a Terme
International de France has agreed to join Globex, an off-hours
electronic trading system being developed by the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC, officials said Thursday.
   The French exchange, which is known by its acronym MATIF, is the
third outside exchange to announce its intention to join Globex and
offer products for trading on the system.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange, which trades primarily oil and
platinum futures, and the Sydney Futures Exchange of Australia
previously announced plans to join Globex.
   The MATIF is Europe's highest-volume futures exchange and the
first in the European time zones to join Globex. It lists a variety
of financial and commodity futures including a French government
bond futures contract and a stock-index futures contract based on 40
stocks traded on the Paris Bourse stock exchange.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Merc's executive committee,
said the addition of the French exchange to Globex would give the
system a partner in each of the world's three major time zones,
making Globex ``the worldwide transaction system it set out to
become.''
   The automated system, which is expected to become operational
this fall, will use a computer to match buy and sell orders during
the hours that the member exchanges' trading floors are closed.
   The Chicago Merc, the world's second-largest futures exchange,
and London-based Reuters announced plans to create the system in
1987.
   Futures are contracts to buy or sell a commodity or financial
instrument at an agreed-upon price at a specified future date.
   The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange,
announced last month that it was developing its own automated
off-hours trading system to compete with Globex.

<HEAD>Supply Fears Fuel 5-Day Copper Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Persistent supply concerns pushed copper futures prices sharply
higher Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange, capping a weeklong
rally that boosted copper by more than 10 percent.
   On other exchanges, precious metals also advanced; energy futures
retreated; pork bellies plummeted, leading livestock futures lower;
and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Copper settled 2.4 cents to 5.6 cents higher with the most active
contract, for delivery in May, at $1.437 a pound. The spot March
contract finished at $1.53 a pound compared with the spot settlement
price of $1.386 a pound a week earlier.
   Prices rose despite an apparent reduction in tensions between
Peruvian copper miners and the government.
   In Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper-producing nation, the
National Federation of Mine Workers continued plans for a 3-day
``warning strike'' beginning March 26. The miners contend the
government has not honored the agreement that ended a 57-day strike
late last year.
   The union said Friday it was willing to accept some compromises
in the interim before the strike, although workers did not rule out
possibly extending the strike beyond three days.
   Copper's underlying supply-and-demand factors remained
overwhelmingly bullish, with near-term availability extremely
limited going into the second quarter, historically a period of
heavy consumption.
   ``We have a convergence of the technical, fundamental and
seasonal factors,'' said William O'Neill, research director with
Elders Futures Inc. in New York. ``This is an extremely positive
period for the market.''
   The Commodity Exchange reported that copper supplies deliverable
against the March contract increased by 113 tons Thursday to 17,446
tons. But analysts said copper stocks are so low that the increase
had scant market impact.
   Precious-metals futures prices rose amid fears that a strike in
the industrial-metals section of South Africa's Rustenburg mining
complex could spread to the platinum sector. Rustenburg is the
world's largest platinum mine.
   A drop in the dollar's value against other major currencies also
contributed to the rise in precious metal values, analysts said.
   Platinum settled $5.40 to $5.60 higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with April at $539.30 a troy ounce. On the Commodity
Exchange, gold settled $2.70 to $3.20 higher with April at $389.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.9 cents to 4.8 cents higher with March at
$5.801 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures traded higher for most of the session on the New
York Merc but finished lower after a late wave of profit-taking that
erased nearly half of the previous day's strong gains in the crude
oil market.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 22 cents
lower with April at $18.56 a barrel; heating oil was .59 cent to
1.07 cents lower with April at 50.80 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .36 cent to .72 cent lower with April at 51.53 cents a
gallon.
   Heavy profit-taking in the pork belly market led the decline in
livestock and meat futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The March belly contract plummeted 2 cents a pound, the
maximum daily price change permitted by the exchange.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .55 cent lower with April at
77.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .45 cent lower
with March at 82.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent lower to
.08 cent higher with April at 44.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents lower to .48 cent higher with March at 37.25
cents a pound.
   Wheat, oats and soybean futures prices settled mostly lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade but corn finished mixed in response to a
lower-than-expected forecast for Argentine corn production.
   Most of the selling was triggered by profit-taking the soybean
market, which soared to a 4-week high on Thursday.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with March at $4.32} a
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 2} cents higher with March at
$2.78\ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with March at
$2.05{ a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents lower to { cent higher with
March at $7.67} a bushel.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were mixed Friday in lackluster
trading, finishing little changed despite early declines in the face
of an overnight drop by the dollar.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 1-16 point late
Friday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, was unchanged from late Thursday at 9.12 percent.
   After surging Thursday, bond prices opened sharply lower in
response to the dollar's decline overnight in foreign exchange
overseas, analysts said. A declining dollar hurts bond prices by
reducing yields available to foreign investors, who are sizeable
holders of dollar-denominated debt.
   The market recovered some ground after reports that Venezuela was
making payments on its $33 billion foreign debt conditional on the
success of its government austerity program. The dollar finished
lower, but did not drag the bond market with it, analysts said.
   Bonds were little affected by the government's report that the
Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.6 percent in January,
while orders to factories for manufactured goods dropped 1.3 percent.
   ``There was no surprise there _ no news,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief economist for Nikko Securities International. ``It looks like
we're sitting and waiting for the next piece of news.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments ranged from unchanged to up 1-16 point, intermediate
maturities were up 1-32 point and long-term issues were unchanged to
down 1-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was down 0.10 at 1,122.28.
   In corporate trading, industrials were higher. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.16
to 296.88.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-32 point. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.74 percent from 7.75 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.92 percent as the
discount fell 3 basis points to 8.62 percent. Yields on six-month
blls inched up to 9.17 percent as the discount gained 1 basis point
at 8.66 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 9.32 percent as
the discount fell 2 basis points to 8.62 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 9{ percent, down from 913-16 percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Coniston Revises TW Services Bid, Plans to Run for Board Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners said Friday it was dropping a
key condition from its $1.4 billion offer for TW Services Inc. and
said it planned to wage a proxy fight for seats on the food services
company's board.
   In a letter to TW Services Chairman Frank L. Salizzoni, Coniston
Partner principal Paul E. Tierney Jr. said his group was dropping a
condition of its $29-a-share offer that the TW board approve the
proposed merger.
   The revision came a day after a Chancery Court judge in Delaware
refused to void TW Services' ``poison-pill'' anti-takeover defense.
   Another Coniston principal, Augustus K. Oliver, said the court
acted partly because of the merger approval condition. He said by
dropping that provision Coniston can return to court on the poison
pill issue.
   He said Coniston hoped for a speedy response to the revised offer
from TW Services.
   In a statement, TW Services said, ``We acknowledge receipt of the
amended offer and the board of directors will respond in due
course.''
   In the letter, Tierney said that in the event that TW Services
fails to ``respond expeditiously to negotiate in good faith with us
or to conduct a full and fair auction of the company, we intend to
renew our motion to redeem the `poison pill' in Chancery Court.''
   Under the poison pill, TW Services shareholders would be allowed
to purchase additional stock in the company at a steep discount in
the event of a hostile takeover. With more stock outstanding, the
cost of acquiring the company would rise sharply.
   Tierney also said in his letter that his group intends to ``file
all preliminary documents necessary'' to begin the process of having
its nominess elected to the TW Services board.
   Jim Ryan, a spokesman for TW Services, said three seats are up
for election at the company's April 26 meeting. The board currently
has 11 members.
   Coniston launched a tender offer for TW Services last October. It
already owns about about 19 percent of TW Services' 48.5 million
shares.
   TW Services owns 1,200 Denny's restaurants and 400 Hardee's
restaurants, among other properties.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Atlanta's Minority-Female Business Enterprise
Program ^Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `An employee ..., with 3 grafs comment from
city officials, Young news conference slated; picks up 7th graf: `Among

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's affirmative action-minority enterprise
program was overturned Thursday by the state Supreme Court, which
said officials failed to produce enough evidence of past
discrimination to justify it.
   The court also unanimously found that the Minority-Female
Business Enterprise program, begun in 1975, was too broadly drawn
and failed to consider alternatives to a yearly minority
participation goal in city contracting.
   The program sets a goal of 35 percent of city contract dollars go
to minorities. City officials declined comment on the ruling and its
implications for the program, one of the nation's most recognized
and most emulated.
   ``It is apparent the city had available to it less intrusive
means of accomplishing the MFBE's race-conscious purposes but had
not fully explored those,'' Justice Willis B. Hunt Jr. wrote for the
seven-member court.
   It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on behalf of the
American Subcontractors Association effectively dismantles the
program.
   City Attorney Marva Brooks said an appeal is unlikely, but she
said unspecified steps would be taken to save the minority program.
Mayor Andrew Young scheduled a news conference for noon Friday to
discuss the ruling.
   Rodney K. Strong, the city's Contract Compliance director, said
he expected that the city would declare a bidding moratorium for a
few months on all city contracts, except for emergency situations,
while a new program is developed.
   Among those pleased with the ruling was William O. Miller,
president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, an Atlanta-based
public-interest center that joined the lawsuit against the city.
   ``This means city contracts in the future must be let on a truly
competitive basis, with no entrepreneur, black or white, receiving
preference,'' Miller said.
   Atlanta's program has grown steadily since it was created in 1975
by then-Mayor Maynard Jackson. Some consider it one of the nation's
most well-monitored and carefully designed programs of its type.
   The city could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But in January
the nation's highest court overturned a similar program in Richmond,
Va. Still, Atlanta officials hoped their program would survive.
   ``I think there are a number of differences between our case and
the Richmond case,'' Mayor Andrew Young said in January. ``It's the
difference between a law based on the spirit of fairness and a law
that seems to mandate'' minority set-asides.
   Last year, the city of Atlanta awarded $29.4 million to
minority-owned and operated companies, 36.7 percent of all city
contracting business. More than $300 million in city business has
gone to minority companies since the 35 percent minority
participation goal was established in 1975.
   Fulton and DeKalb counties have goals of 20 percent minority
participation in country contracts. Their programs were not affected
by the ruling Thursday.

<HEAD>Car And Truck Sales Slip 10.5 Percent In February</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Car and truck sales in the United States slipped
10.5 percent during February, led downward by a 30.7 percent decline
in Chrysler Corp. car sales during the last week of the month,
automakers reported Friday.
   Sales of U.S. and imported cars and light trucks showed declines
for late February, for the entire month and for the first two months
of this year compared with the corresponding periods of 1988.
   During the Feb. 21-28 period, car and truck sales reported by the
eight domestic vehicle producers were down 14.3 percent this year
compared with the same time last year. Vehicles sold at an average
daily rate of 46,336 during the period this year, compared with a
daily rate of 54,044 vehicles during late February last year.
   Industry insiders have predicted that 1989 sales will be softer
than in 1988, the second-best calendar sales year on record. Part of
the reason for the good year last year were strong sales during
January and February due to heavy use of incentives.
   Incentives have been in effect this year, but on a smaller number
of cars and light trucks.
   The sales slides in late February and for the month surprised
analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York City.
   ``They came in lower than I expected,'' he said, adding that some
incentives for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. ended during
the last part of the month. ``It's leaving the industry with a lot
of inventory.''
   Healy estimated that GM had 85 days' worth, Ford 88 and Chrysler
84.
   On Friday, GM announced it was extending for two more weeks a
shutdown of its Doraville, Ga., assembly plant, which makes
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme cars. GM blamed the extended shutdown,
which affected 4,000 workers, on high inventories.
   ``We've got too many cars out in the field,'' said Doraville
plant manager F. Thomas Brady.
   Among the nation's Big Three automakers, Ford alone showed
increased sales during late February, the month or during the first
two months of the year. But those gains were tiny.
   The nation's No. 2 automaker said it sold cars at a daily rate of
8,755 during late February this year, up 0.4 percent from the 8,721
daily rate during the same period last year. For the month, Ford's
car sales slipped 2.3 percent and for the year, the company is
selling cars at a rate 0.5 percent higher than the same time last
year.
   Chrysler's sales of domestic cars skidded 30.7 percent during
late February. Analysts and company officials have said the nation's
No. 3 automaker is suffering a bit from having too little variety in
its product lineup. Chrysler's monthly sales were off 26.8 percent
last month when compared with February a year ago. Car sales during
the first two months at Chrysler are at a pace 18.4 percent below
last year's during the same time.
   GM's domestic car sales also fell dramatically compared with last
year, dropping 25.4 percent in late February, 17.1 percent for the
entire month and 14.6 percent for the first two months of the year.

   Nabisco Brands Inc. indicated Friday it has
been phasing highly saturated tropical oils out of its products
since 1987, responding to a multimillionaire health activist's
recent attacks on the cookie and cracker maker over the issue.
   In a letter to Omaha, Neb.-based activist Phil Sokolof, a Nabisco
executive stated the company actively has been seeking to reduce the
amount of saturated fats in its products.
   ``Specifically, on the fats of interest to you _ Tropical Oils
and Lard _ we are committed to their removal from our products as
expeditiously as technology and testing allow; in fact, we believe
that we have led our industry in both the timing and number of
products that we already have reformulated,'' wrote John Manfredi, a
senior vice president.
   Saturated fats can increase blood cholesterol levels; high
cholesterol is a risk factor for heart attacks. Sokolof, 66, blames
high cholesterol for the near-fatal heart attack he suffered 22
years ago.
   Sokolof said, after a phone conversation Thursday evening with
Manfredi, that he had gotten the assurances he wanted. Manfredi
followed up with the letter on Friday.
   ``Yesterday was the first unequivocal announcement,'' Sokolof
said in a phone interview. ``I am elated.''
   Sokolof says he has spent $2 million of his own money on his
cholesterol-awareness campaign. In November he placed his first
series of full-page ads in five newspapers warning of the dangers of
tropical oils such as palm and coconut oil and listing brands that
contained them.
   Since then, 11 other food giants, including General Mills Inc.,
Pillsbury Co., Quaker Oats Co. and Kellogg Co., have announced they
will drop tropical oils from some products.
   The latest ads, which ran Tuesday in the New York Times, USA
Today and the New York Post, singled out East Hanover-based Nabisco
for lagging behind the nation's other major food companies in
announcing they were changing their recipes to phase out the
offending oils.
   Sokolof said more than 60 of the company's products have lard or
tropical oil. The ad featured an array of Nabisco products including
Triscuit, Ritz crackers, Fig Newtons, Oreos, Premium and Barnum's
Animals crackers.
   Manfredi said in a telephone interview Friday that Nabisco some
2{ years ago began ``a very active program'' ago to determine what
could be done to remove highly saturated fats from food.
   Manfredi said Nabisco on Monday would start making tropical
oil-free Triscuit crackers, the last of the company's 100-item
cracker line containing the fat.
   Manfredi said only three of 35 new products introduced in the
last two years have lard or tropical oils, and many of Nabisco's
popular products have been reformulated to exclude them.

   President Carlos Andres Perez on Friday
blamed rioting that killed 300 people on the crushing burden of
foreign debt and said Venezuela can keep making loan payments only
if his austerity program succeeds.
   Venezuela owes foreign creditors $33 billion. On Friday,
President Bush announced he would provide the country with a $450
million loan to help the struggling South American nation meet its
short-term financial needs.
   Perez told reporters that the four days of disturbances caused by
price increases could occur in other Latin American countries.
   ``The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a name
written with capital letters _ foreign debt,'' he said at a news
conference.
   Perez also bitterly criticized industrialized nations for giving
little or no help to support democratic governments.
   Spain announced Friday it would send a $50 million loan to help
Venezuela recover from the rioting. The unrest was caused by
government-imposed bus fare increases, which appeared to release
pent-up frustration over its austerity program.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush called Perez on Friday to express concern and support for
Perez's ``courageous and determined efforts to address his country's
economic and financial situation.''
   Later, U.S. officials disclosed that Bush was making the $450
million loan to help ease the financial crisis facing Perez'
29-day-old government.
   Perez confirmed that at least 300 people had been killed and
2,000 injured since Monday. He put the number of arrests at ``barely
1,000.''
   Newspaper reports estimated the death toll at 300 to 400, and
said more than 2,000 had been arrested in Caracas alone.
   Martial law remained in effect Friday with a dusk-to-dawn curfew
forcing stores to restrict opening hours. Soliers patrolled Caracas
on foot and in armored cars, and there was sporadic gunfire.
   However, the capital of 4 million people appeared to be returning
to normal. Buses and subways ran regularly and downtown streets were
crowded. Joggers were seen in parks early in the morning.
   Long lines still formed outside grocery stores, but the
government set up distribution centers to relieve food shortages.
   Perez linked the bloodiest civil unrest in Venezuela's history to
the burden of foreign debt and said it was jeopardizing a new wave
of democracy sweeping Latin American.
   He accused industrialized nations of inflexibility in demanding
repayment of the region's $420 billion foreign debt without regard
to a nation's ability to pay.
   ``I hope this painful sacrifice by our country will serve for the
leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not
exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious,'' he said.
   Perez said whether Venezuela can continue to make principal and
interest payments on its $33 billion foreign debt depends on the
success of his austerity program.
   In a question-and-answer session with reporters, Perez appeared
to indicate that Venezuela had already suspended the debt payments.
   However, a senior Venezuelan official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said later that ``there was an honest difference of
opinion over interpretation'' of Perez' remarks, and stressed that
Venezuela would continue to make the payments at least until the end
of the month. Edgard A. Leal, the country's chief debt negotiator,
also said Venezuela would continue to make payments.
   Perez, who came to office just one month ago, was referring to
economic austerity measures required under an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund in exchange for a $4.3 billion loan over
the next three years.
   Earlier this week, the government asked the International
Monetary Fund to include provisions allowing Venezuela to suspend
all payments on its debt until September. Venezuela also asked for
an additional $4.3 billion in loans from the institution in the next
three years.
   Venezuela's austerity program includes price increases for a
range of basic goods and services, including bus fares, food,
gasoline and electricity.
   Venezuela is one of the few developing nations that has been
servicing foreign debt, Perez said, complaining that Western banks
had not recognized the effort by granting new loans.
   Oil-producing Venezuela has for decades been one of the
wealthiest and politically stable nations in Latin America. But a
continuing fall in world oil prices, combined with debt payments,
has depleted monetary reserves, creating the economic crisis.
   Real wages have since then fallen by a third since 1981, and
inflation is expected to double this year to 70 percent.
   Perez said Venezuela could expect six months of economic
hardship. But after that, he said, the economy will start to expand.
   He said there was no immediate threat to Venezuelan stability,
but warned that prolonged economic decline could ``undermine the
foundations of democracy.''
