   House Speaker Jim Wright is planning to ask the
House to scale back the congressional pay raise scheduled to take
effect next week, even as House members were lining up
overwhelmingly against the increase, a congressional source said
Wednesday.
   The $45,500 pay raise _ a 51 percent hike _ will take effect next
Wednesday unless both the Senate and House vote to block it.
   Wright, D-Texas, plans to propose that the increase be scaled
back to 30 percent, said the source, speaking on condition of
anonymity. A 30 percent raise would hike the current congressional
salary from $89,500 by $26,850, to a total of $116,350.
   Wright plans to seek a vote on approving the lower raise on Feb.
9, The Washington Post reported in its Thursday editions.
   Meanwhile, House members indicated in an Associated Press survey
that they want a vote on the sensitive issue.
   Survey results put additional pressure on Wright to abandon a
carefully orchestrated strategy of taking no vote until after the
raise automatically takes effect next Wednesday.
   Wright said Tuesday he would hold a vote if that was what
lawmakers wanted. The speaker announced he was circulating a
questionnaire privately to determine whether House members really
wanted a recorded vote. Wright's tally was not made available
Wednesday.
   However, an Associated Press informal survey of nearly a third of
the 435 House members showed about 88 percent of those responding
wanted a vote on the pay raise.
   Meanwhile, a survey of the entire House released Wednesday by
opponents of the pay raise showed 62 percent saying they would vote
``no'' if the issue came to a vote.
   Under the law, members of Congress and other top federal
officials will get pay raises of about 50 percent on Feb. 8 unless
both chambers reject it. Rank-and-file congressional salaries would
go from $89,500 to $135,000, under the recommendation submitted by
former President Reagan and supported by President Bush.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised a
vote in his chamber this week. Surveys show the pay raise would be
handily rejected there.
   House Democratic leaders, with Republican consent, had adopted a
strategy of avoiding a vote until after the deadline and then
softening the political blow of the substantial pay raise by passing
new ethics rules including a ban on lawmakers accepting speaking
fees.
   The strategy was based on the opinion that House members
supported the raise but would find it politically impossible to vote
for it.
   Wright, who had been taking most of the political heat on the
issue, changed that strategy on Tuesday. His survey was designed, in
part, to demonstrate that it was not Jim Wright alone who favored
the pay increase.
   ``Over the past several weeks, I have heard from many members on
both sides of the aisle. I have a pretty good idea of how they
feel,'' Wright said. ``They support `regular procedure''' _ which
would mean committee hearings and a legislative schedule that would
make a vote impossible before the Feb. 8 deadline.
   But when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprise
him and demand one, Wright said, ``If the members want it, yes, of
course''
   The Associated Press contacted 143 congressional offices and
found 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the pay
raise. Only six said they were against it and seven were undecided.
There was no response from 38 offices. It should be noted that
advocates of the pay raise have been reluctant to publicly indicate
their support, for fear of the political fallout.
   Mark Johnson, Wright's spokesman, said it would be wrong to use
any informal surveys to predict the results of the speaker's private
survey.
   However, another top leadership aide, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, pointed out that the speaker's survey could compound
the political problem if the results are at odds with those from
media surveys.
   Several lawmakers who were following the leadership strategy of
keeping silent on the issue privately expressed aggravation at the
speaker's new tactic.
   ``This is like a war in which the general says to take the hill,
you turn around, and find the general's gone,'' said a Republican
member who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   If a vote were scheduled, House members overwhelmingly would
reject the pay increase, according to a survey released Wednesday by
several groups opposed to the increase.
   The survey said 270 House members, or about 62 percent, said they
would oppose the raise if it came to a vote. Forty-seven, or about
11 percent, said they would support the raise; 75 members, about 17
percent, declined to state a position, and 41 members, about 9
percent, declined to respond.
   The survey was conducted by Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy
group founded by Ralph Nader; the National Taxpayers Union, a
non-partisan organization of fiscal conservatives; and Coalitions
for America, a conservative organization headed by activist Paul
Weyrich.
   After the survey was released, Rep. Thomas Carper, R-Del., said
he too was against the raise, even though the survey had listed him
as undecided. Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., was also listed as undecided,
but has been publicly opposed to the raise for more than a week.
   ``A failure to vote on this issue would be a fundamental
breakdown of democracy,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen.
   Senate opponents of the pay increase, at a hearing of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, said the current system of allowing
pay increases to take effect without a vote was hurting Congress'
public image.
   ``What must they think of us, when we run from accountability, as
cockroaches run from bright light?'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. told the committee that, ``People all
over the United States are saying, `They're a bunch of crooks'.''
   But committee member Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the raise was
needed, especially for judges and federal officials.
   ``What does it cost government to have incompetent people at the
top?'' Stevens asked.
   With the future of the pay raise uncertain, House and Senate
negotiators were moving ahead Wednesday with their separate but
similar efforts to draft ethics legislation to bar honoraria and
restrict other outside income.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Duck Talk Sweeps the White House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush may be getting his ducks in a
row on the federal budget, but he certainly doesn't want any of his
budget lines to turn up as ducks.
   That's because a duck by any other name in Washington these days
is a tax increase.
   And Bush administration officials insist there'll be no ducks _
new taxes _ in the budget plan Bush sends Congress on Feb. 9.
   This duck business started when budget director Richard G. Darman
wrote a letter to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
reaffirming Bush's intention to resist new taxes.
   On whether the administration might hide a tax under another
name, Darman suggested that wouldn't wash. Most Americans, he
suggested, know that ``if it walks like a duck and quacks like a
duck, it must be a duck.''
   That's an old line, but Darman gave it new currency.
   Now it has joined the lexicon of other budget cliches, mentioned
almost as frequently these days as that mythical budget ``table''
that items are always described as being off or on.
   As in, nothing's ``off the table.'' Or everything's ``on the
table.''
   ``Not to mix metaphors, but ducks are off the table,'' Darman
told Congress.
   Bush himself has picked up on the duck talk.
   At his first news conference, he was asked whether a Treasury
proposal for a depositor fee to assist troubled savings-and-loans
might violate his anti-tax stand.
   ``I would refer you to Richard Darman,'' the president responded.
``He's the guy that defined that very well up there with the duck
test on the Hill.''
   Darman repeatedly used the duck analogy during his confirmation
hearings. He was presented at one point with a mock trophy by
committee Chairman Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   It consisted of three bright yellow toy ducks and the label, ``if
it quacks, it's a tax.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu threw yet another
ingredient into the duck soup _ a rose.
   Asked at a news conference whether he thought the savings and
loan fee was a tax, Sununu responded obliquely: ``Yesterday's rose
is tomorrow's rose.''
   When he did not elaborate further, he was asked: ``A rose is a
rose?'' and ``It passes the rose test?''
   ``Let's put it this way,'' Sununu said. ``Yesterday's duck is
tomorrow's duck.''
   Actually today's duck is not yesterday's duck, so far as Bush is
concerned. Bush's duck of yesteryear was not a tax increase but a
Sandinista.
   When running for re-election in 1984, then-Vice President Bush
caused something of a stir in a campaign speech at Texas A&amp;M
University as he portrayed the Sandinista government in Nicaragua as
Marxist.
   ``If you walk like a duck and you quack like a duck and you say
you're a duck, you're a duck,'' he said.
   But so far, the new Bush administration hasn't reported any
conversations with tax ducks.

<HEAD>Mixed-up Wiring, Plumbing in 17 Airliners Prompts Blanket Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 700 Boeing jetliners operated by
every major U.S. airline must undergo a comprehensive inspection for
cross-wiring and cross-plumbing in their safety systems, after
problems were discovered in 17 aircraft.
   The Federal Aviation Administraton, in issuing the
``airworthiness directive'' late Tuesday, also noted that Boeing is
studying its design, production procedures and testing of airliner
emergency systems to see if changes are needed.
   The newly ordered tests are not expected to disrupt airline
schedules and can be completed anytime over the next 3{ weeks while
the airliners are undergoing routine maintenance.
   The order affects 741 newer jetliners flown by U.S. carriers. It
applies to all Boeing 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s built after Dec. 31,
1980. Most foreign airliners using the planes also are expected to
comply, although the FAA has no jurisdiction over them.
   ``The comprehensive (directive) will require functional testing
of the engine and cargo compartment fire detection, warning and
extinguishing systems, both electrical and plumbing to insure that
crossed wiring or plumbing does not exist,'' said the FAA
announcement.
   No accident or emergency has resulted from faulty wiring or
plumbing found in airliners in recent weeks after the FAA issued
limited directives applying to only specific systems in certain
types of aircraft.
   But the foulups, including cross-wiring, cross-plumbing,
incomplete wiring and other problems, could have caused shutdown of
the wrong engine in the event of fire, activation of the wrong
sprinkling system in a cargo hold or lack of any response in
emergency systems.
   The concern arose with speculation that the pilot in a Jan. 8
British Midland Airways 737 crash that killed 44 people in England
may have been deceived by faulty wiring into shutting down his only
good engine. Cause of the crash is still under investigation.
   The crash led to similar inspection orders in Great Britain.
Airbus 320s also were included in the British order, although
problems have been found only in Boeing aircraft.
   Jack Gamble, Boeing spokesman, said Tuesday night that the
directive is based on service bulletins Boeing has been putting out
in recent months and years. Service bulletins are sent out each time
a problem of some sort is found with a model of a plane to all
carriers using that model and to the FAA. Checks of planes are
voluntary after a service bulletin is issued.
   But if the FAA sees a pattern in the bulletins, it is likely to
issue a directive, making checks of the airliners mandatory.
   ``It's a preventive and precautionary check,'' he said.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the latest order, which gives
airlines 25 days to comply, would not disrupt regularly scheduled
flights. He said planes whose systems were already tested under
previous orders need not retest under the new order.
   Boeing's Gamble said ``a lot of the '57 and '37 stuff already has
been done.''
   The FAA estimated the inspections would cost airlines a total of
$222,000. Airline analysts say, however, that actual cost of
FAA-ordered inspections is generally two or three times higher than
the FAA estimates.
   It said the order is a ``precautionary measure'' triggered by
newly discovered problems with three 757s and a 737. Farrar said he
did not know which airlines reported the latest cases of faulty
wiring.
   On one plane, an overheat indicator would have shown a problem in
the wrong engine. In two others, fire extinguishers would have been
triggered in the wrong engines. In the fourth, an incomplete circuit
would have prevented a fire extinguisher from firing.
   The first cross-wiring directive applying only to two 737 models
found no problems. A second triggered by reports of cross-wiring in
two 757s, resulted in discovery of five more miswired aircraft.
   Earlier directives followed discovery of improperly installed
plumbing in two 767s. The inspections exposed four other aircraft
with similar problems that, in the event of a fire in one of two
holds, would have routed extinguishing fluids to the hold that was
not burning.
   The inspections would cover 472 Boeing 737s, 33 Jumbo 747s, 123
757s and 113 767s, the FAA said.

   Authorities have discovered the bodies
of six people who were shot in the head with a shotgun near a
trailer compound, and one of the residents has been charged with two
of the deaths.
   The body of a man found Tuesday in the rusted hull of a car in a
junkyard near the three-trailer compound appeared to have been shot
twice in the back of the head at close range, said Assistant State
Medical Examiner Dr. Vasudeo Kshirsagar.
   The condition of the body indicated that the victim had been dead
several months, Kshirsagar said, adding that the five others
appeared to have been killed in a similar manner.
   Police believe the body is that of 20-year-old Michael Schillings
of North Carolina, who came to the compound to live last spring and
was reported missing last summer.
   On Monday, the body of 22-year-old Jimmy Price was found on the
site about 30 feet from the car, authorities said. The junkyard is
about 200 yards east of the compound, where the first two bodies
were discovered Jan. 8.
   ``We have a consistent pattern. It was a shotgun. It was
consistent with the other cases,'' said Kanawha County Sheriff Art
Ashley.
   If all six bodies are linked to the same killer, it would be the
worst series of deaths in West Virginia attributed to the same
person.
   Authorities said 19-year-old Mark Southern McCallister is being
held without bond on charges of murdering brothers Billy and Otis
Sanson, who lived with McCallister at the compound in St. Albans, a
town of 15,000 people 15 miles west of Charleston.
   Prosecutors said McCallister has confessed to the brothers'
murders.
   Police found the body of the Sansons' sister, Bonnie Pauley, at
an abandoned motel across the street from the compound on Jan. 21.
Another victim, McCallister's grandmother, Charlotte Farrell, 69,
was found in her nearby home.
   ``We hope this ight wrap up the investigation from the standpoint
of looking for people,'' Ashley said.
   The sheriff's department declined to say whether McCallister
would be charged in the other deaths or to speculate on a motive.
   However, authorities said all the victims lived at the compound,
which is now abandoned, and Price and Schillings had dated Bonnie
Pauley.

<HEAD>Researchers Show Fast Method for Robot Depth Perception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Want to see how some robots of the future may
find their way around? Hold a finger in front of you and stare at it.
   Now shake your head, still focusing on that finger.
   Objects behind your finger appear to move in the same direction
as your head, while those in front of it move in the opposite
direction.
   Using that principle, researchers have demonstrated a fast method
for depth perception in visually guided robots, which should help
them navigate around objects more quickly, a scientist says.
   A robot at the University of Rochester in New York state trains a
pair of cameras on an object to gauge the distance to it, said Dana
Ballard, a computer science professor at the university.
   The distance measurement is updated 30 times a second, Ballard
said, so ``it potentially allows you to move at high speed.''
Current robots guided by visual feedback can move only slowly
because of the time it takes them to judge the location of objects
in their path, he said Tuesday.
   Chuck Thorpe, research scientist at the Robotics Institute of
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said the Rochester robot
is the first to combine several previously known concepts into such
a high-speed system.
   The cameras are mounted on a motor-driven platform that allows
them to move up and down or side to side. The platform is mounted on
the end of a large industrial robot arm, allowing the platform to
move over a range about 12 feet in diameter at speeds up to about
one yard per second.
   Currently, a human directs the cameras to a reference point, but
eventually that will occur automatically, Ballard said in a
telephone interview.
   The work shows it is easier for computers to calculate distance
to objects if the images come from moving cameras than if the
cameras are stationary, he said.
   The research also demonstrated a way for the pair of cameras to
remain locked on an object while it moves toward the robot, an
ability called vergence, he said.
   The work was led by Ballard and colleague Chris Brown.

<HEAD>ANC Urges Winnie Mandela to Disband Youth Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
has asked anti-apartheid activist Winnie Mandela to disband her
group of teen-age bodyguards, which has been accused of kidnapping
and engaging in gang feuds.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and community leaders in the
black township of Soweto support disbanding the group, known as the
Mandela United soccer club, saying it hurts the campaign to end
white minority rule.
   Several newspapers have reported that continuing allegations that
the youth group has engaged in unlawful behavior have become a
source of friction between Mrs. Mandela and her husband Nelson,
South Africa's best-known black leader.
   Nelson Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 for his ANC
activities.
   ``Winnie can't afford to have the Mandela name dragged through
the mud by associating with these people,'' Tutu said in New York,
the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day reported Tuesday.
   At the Lusaka, Zambia headquarters of the outlawed ANC, spokesman
Tom Sebina said Tuesday that the message about Mandela United was
sent to Mrs. Mandela after discussions among the organization's
leaders.
   The youths, who generally wear track suits, often accompany Mrs.
Mandela to public gatherings.
   Mrs. Mandela last week said she had disbanded the group because
of ``state harassment.'' But several of the youths were present
Saturday when she attended the funeral of a slain activist.
   While guarding Mrs. Mandela, the youths occasionally have
threatened journalists and others.
   In July, the Mandela family home in Soweto was destroyed in a
fire set by a gang of black high school students who had been
feuding with Mandela United members.
   Mandela United also has been accused of abducting four youths
from a Soweto church. One of the four still is missing. Mrs. Mandela
and others have alleged the kidnapped youths may have been sexually
abused by a church clergyman.
   About 150 Soweto community leaders met last week to investigate
the abductions, and later urged that Mandela United be disbanded.
   Mrs. Mandela, widely viewed abroad as a hero of the fight against
the white minority government's policy of racial separation, has
become entangled in several controversies in recent years.
   She has endorsed ``necklace'' killings, whereby black activists
set alight gasoline-soaked tires placed around the necks of
so-called government collaborators.
   She also has been criticized for building the mansion in Soweto,
although she has never moved into it.

<HEAD>Many People Missing out on SSI Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost half of the nation's senior citizens who
may be eligible for Supplemental Security Income benefits are not
enrolled in the program, according to the American Association of
Retired Persons.
   SSI provides monthly cash payments to eligible low-income people
who are 65 years and older, blind or disabled. The maximum federal
SSI benefit this year is $368 a month for an individual and $553 a
month for a couple.
   Some states supplement the payments with their own funds. The
Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 36 percent of
SSI recipients receive state supplements.
   The study, conducted for AARP by ICF Inc., a research and
consulting firm, said its finding was consistent with other surveys
that have put the SSI participation rate at about 50 percent.
   Another study conducted for AARP by Louis Harris and Associates
found that one-third of the eligible older people who are not
receiving SSI benefits have never heard of the program, and many
others are misinformed about eligibility requirements.
   SSI paid about $12.3 billion in federal benefits last fiscal year
and is budgeted to pay out $12.5 billion this year.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu says he is impressed
that Secretary of State James A. Baker III appears open-minded to
ideas on pressing South Africa to abolish its system of apartheid.
   ``I don't want to be euphoric, but we certainly have been
impressed,'' said the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who attended a
meeting Tuesday between Baker and a delegation sponsored by the
World Council of Churches.
   Tutu said Baker made no promises, but indicated the new
administration is reviewing its policy toward South Africa.
   Asked to compare his meeting with Baker and past sessions with
former Secretary of State George Shultz, Tutu said, ``I was very
impressed by the fact that he was not dogmatic, he actually was
discussing with the group and was interested in any initiative that
the United States might actively take to pressure the South African
government to the negotiating table.''
   ``They are ... involved in a review process. He did not dismiss
us, he listened to us with very considerable interest,'' Tutu said
after the half-hour session at the State Department.
   Tutu joined a delegation that has been on a three-week tour of
the United States, several West European capitals and Japan to
convince government officials to take a stronger stand against South
Africa's apartheid policy.

<NOTE>FDA Panel Develops Guidelines on Dental X-rays</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration panel has set
new guidelines on how often people need dental X-rays, saying its
goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure.
   Children with healthy teeth may need dental X-rays no more than
once every year or two, and dentally healthy adults once every two
or three years, the panel said.
   The guidelines, reported in the current issue of the Journal of
the American Dental Association, were prompted by concern among some
experts about the frequency of dental X-rays, both overuse and
underuse.
   ``Although the radiation risk from a dental X-ray is extremely
low, our goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure,'' FDA
Commissioner Frank E. Young said in statement Tuesday.
   ``Until these guidelines were developed, there were few concrete
criteria a dentist could use in deciding when X-rays were needed,''
he said.
   Young also stressed the flexibility of the guidelines, saying,
``These are not hard and fast rules. In deciding whether an X-ray is
needed, the dentist must use clinical judgment in evaluating the
patient's needs.''

<TEXT>
   The ``First Lady of Irish Radio'' has been chosen
as the first female grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade in
its 226-year history.
   And Dorothy Hayden Cudahy _ who accepted the honor with smilin'
Irish eyes, not tearful ones _ says it's about time.
   Mrs. Cudahy, 66, had been passed over in favor of a man in three
previous years before she was elected Tuesday night to lead the
200,000 marchers in the nation's largest and oldest St. Patrick's
Day celebration.
   Afterward, she said Irish women have too often been left standing
in the wings while men took center stage.
   ``Like everything else, men run it but women do all the work,''
she said of past parades.
   ``When I march up there, ladies and gentleman, girls and boys
will remember my mother and your mother and all the Irish women who
came over here and did so much,'' Mrs. Cudahy said.
   Mrs. Cudahy and the other nominee, 61-year-old Mary Holt Moore,
were on stage in front of 600 people in a Manhattan ballroom when
the vote was announced. Mrs. Moore, a school teacher, hugged and
kissed the winner.
   Mrs. Cudahy is known as the ``First Lady of Irish Radio'' for her
``Irish Memories'' program, which moved last August to WNWK-FM after
more than 40 years on WEVD.
   ``This achievement was really your achievement,'' she told the
delegates.
   The vote was narrow, 256 to 233, but the crowd seemed unanimous
in its delight at seeing a woman chosen to lead the March 17 parade
up Fifth Avenue.
   ``I guess we are a chauvinistic race,'' said delegate Noah
Kingston. ``I suppose the European races in general are. We've
always just went along with the status quo. But the times have
changed and it's long overdue really.''
   ``It's about time,'' said Irene McDonnell, a member of the
Ancient Order of Hibernians. ``The women in Ireland used to hold a
high place before the English invaded.''
   The delegates who picked the grand marshal were chosen from about
200 affiliated organizations that march in the more than
40-block-long parade, which usually attracts more than a million
spectators. The organizations include the Ancient Order of
Hibernians, the United Irish Counties and schools and fraternal
organizations.
   Mrs. Moore said her name would not be on the ballot again.
   ``They kept saying, `Next year,' and I said, `No way,' '' she
said.
   Although Mrs. Cudahy was widely expected to win this year, she
said she ``just couldn't believe it'' when the votes were tallied.
   But she accepted the honor with dry eyes and said she will be
``representing all the women of Ireland who came over as
immigrants.''
   ``I'm not the crying type,'' she said. ``I guess I'm not reacting
like a woman, but I'm so happy.''

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who
completes a turbulent first month in office today, is trying hard to
vanquish a legacy of ethnic violence and chart a more peaceful
course for his island nation.
   Since taking over Jan. 2, he has freed more than 1,400 political
prisoners and lifted tough emergency laws that were imposed 5{ years
ago in an effort to control an insurgency by minority Tamil
extremists.
   Political rivals credit Premadasa with shrewd moves. ``He had to
do something startling with the looming general elections,''
scheduled for Feb. 15, said Kumar Ponnabalam, leader of the
opposition All Ceylon Tamil Congress.
   Despite Premadasa's efforts, an extremist group whose members are
of the Sinhalese ethnic majority has stepped up attacks aimed at
thwarting the vote.
   Police say The People's Liberation Front killed 600 people in
January alone. A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity, termed the figure ``a bit far-fetched'', but declined to
say how many people he thought had been killed.
   For Premadasa, who served as prime minister under former
president Junius R. Jayewardene, the parliamentary elections will be
vital since his plans could be stalled if his United National Party
does not gain a parliamentary majority.
   ``The period to come is (Premadasa's) greatest challenge,'' said
Ralph Bultjens, a veteran Sri Lanka-watcher and a political science
professor at the New School in New York. ``Feb. 15 is his most
urgent hour.''
   In the year leading up to the Dec. 19 presidential election,
Sinhalese extremists killed more than 800 people, mostly government
officials, supporters and police, authorities said.
   Most of the victims were Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of
the Indian Ocean island's 16 million people and dominate the
government, which the front says has made too many concessions to
the Tamils.
   During his election campaign, Premadasa took pains not to blame
the Sinhalese guerrillas for the violence. Instead, he made fervent
appeals to the front to lay down arms and join mainstream politics.
   But Premadasa's ``gamble failed,'' said another Western diplomat,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The Sinhalese extremists are
bent upon violence and will not heed appeals.''
   Despite the violence, Premadasa will fulfill campaign promises to
help the poor, said Ranjan Wijeratna, chairman of the United
National Party.
   Premadasa plans to give $75 monthly to 1.4 million families that
live in extreme poverty. The annual per capita income of nearly half
the country's population is well below the national average of $360.
   Some of Premadasa campaign promises that have already
materialized: 3,500 Indian soldiers were withdrawn and India agreed
to consider Premadasa's promise to change the Indian-Sri Lankan
peace accord into a friendship treaty.
   The July 1987 accord, an attempt to end the Tamil insurgency,
allowed Indian troops onto the island to disarm Tamil guerrillas.
   But India's attempt to play peacemaker for its southern neighbor
met with resistance from Tamil militants and at least 600 Indian
soldiers have been killed. About 44,000 Indian soldiers remain in
the country.
   The Tamil separatist war has claimed about 8,500 lives, most of
them Sinhalese civilians.

<HEAD>Majority Of Koreans Oppose Abolishing Adultery As Crime: Survey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A slim majority of South Koreans oppose
abolishing a law under which people convicted of adultery can be
sentenced up to a year in jail, according to a survey released today.
   These South Koreans feel that if penalties for adultery are
revoked, illicit sex will increase and public morals will decline,
the Korea Applied Statistical Research Institute said its survey
indicates.
   The Justice Ministry has said it will ask the National Assembly
to abolish the law, but the institute said 51 percent of those
polled oppose the move to drop adultery from the criminal codes.
   The private research institute said 60 percent of the 752 women
surveyed and 42 percent of the 756 male respondents wanted to keep
the law. The survey was conducted Jan. 18-20 in Seoul.
   Pollsters said 53 percent of the respondents in their 20s also
felt adultery should remain a crime.
   When those in favor of abolishing the law were asked their
reasons, 66 percent said adultery was an individual concern, not a
matter for the government. Twelve percent said the law doesn't keep
spouses faithful.
   Seventy percent who wanted to keep the law said promiscuity and
immoral sexual behavior would increase without it. Sixteen percent
said wives would be hurt by losing a legal handle to check
indiscretions committed by husbands.
   Forty percent said men would benefit more than women if the law
were changed and only 11 percent said women had more to gain.
   Nearly half of those polled, 46 percent, thought adultery was on
the rise and 25 percent said it was increasing at an ``alarming
rate.''
   No margin of error was given for the survey.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Stocks Fall On Tokyo Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar resumed its strong gains against the
Japanese yen today, while share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange as the dollar's rise discouraged investors, dealers said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 13.80-point
gainer Tuesday, lost 220.62 points, or 0.70 percent, closing at
31,360.68.
   The index started downward in early trading after the dollar's
higher opening in Tokyo, said Kiyoshi Iwasaki of Nomura Securities,
Japan's largest brokerage.
   ``Since the majority of investors have been concerned over the
index's rapid rise recently, they began concertedly selling as
prices went down,'' he added.
   A major influence on the Nikkei, he said, was a decline in
financial issues.
   Today's trading, dominated by sell orders, was active, with
volume on the first section estimated at 1 billion shares.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 130.40, up
1.27 yen from Tuesday's close of 129.13 yen. The dollar opened at
130.58 and ranged between 130.20 yen and 130.67 yen.
   The dollar had gained a total of 2.21 yen last Friday and Monday,
but fell 0.60 yen on Tuesday before climbing again.
   Today's early Tokyo trading was dominated by dollar-buying, but
then speculative investors started selling to take profits, said a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The dollar's strong opening in Tokyo followed a surge in New York
prompted by comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan that current exchange rates were tolerable, dealers said.
   Testifying before a joint economic committee of Congress,
Greenspan said U.S. industry is competitive enough at the present
dollar rate. He added that the current rate of inflation was too
high and that he expected a substantial cut in the U.S. trade
deficit.

<HEAD>Herpes Virus Becomes Resistant to Common Antiviral Drug</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The appearance of viruses that can escape the
herpes drug may be an early sign that a new class of medicines
designed to wipe out viruses will be outwitted by its foes, just as
bacteria-killing drugs have been, researchers say.
   Disease-causing herpes viruses that are resistant to the widely
used drug acyclovir have been seen in AIDS patients, who have little
natural ability to ward off microbes.
   Resistant viruses have not been found in otherwise healthy people
who take the drug for ordinary outbreaks of genital herpes sores.
Researchers disagree over whether the resistant viruses will spread
into the general population.
   ``We see no lack of efficacy of acyclovir in normal patients. I
don't think it should be a concern at all,'' said Dr. Nick Ellis, a
senior scientist at Burroughs Wellcome Co., which produces the drug.
   However, Dr. Martin S. Hirsch of Massachusetts General Hospital
said the current situation may parallel the development of
penicillin in the 1940s.
   ``For the last 40 years, it's been a battle between the organism
and the drug to see which can outwit the other, and it's been a
series of new drugs to try to overcome bacterial resistance,''
Hirsch said in an interview. ``Viruses have never presented that
problem up until now, but it wouldn't surprise me that during the
next 40 years we see the same kind of phenomenon developing in
virology.''
   Two reports on drug-resistant viruses are being published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In one of the studies, doctors described the cases of 12 AIDS
patients who developed severe herpes infections that did not respond
to acyclovir. One co-author, Dr. John Mills of San Francisco General
Hospital, estimates that one in 1,000 AIDS patients has
acyclovir-resistant herpes.
   In the other study, doctors reported two AIDS victims and one
leukemia patient who had overwhelming cytomegalovirus, or CMV,
infection that could not be treated with ganciclovir, a
still-experimental antiviral drug.
   Researchers believe that resistance occurs through natural
genetic mutation. A strain of the virus emerges that has genes
making it impervious to a drug. Then the resistant strain multiplies
and spreads through the victim's body while all the other forms of
the virus are killed off by the medicine.
   An estimated 30 million Americans are infected with the genital
herpes virus, known as herpes simplex virus type 2. Most of them
never develop any symptoms. But for the minority with recurring
genital sores, acyclovir is the only treatment, although others are
being tested.
   Cytomegalovirus infects an estimated 60 percent to 90 percent of
Americans and rarely causes illness in otherwise healthy people.
However, in those whose disease defenses are weak, the virus can
attack organs through the body, resulting in blindness or death.
   Ever since acyclovir's introduction seven years ago as the first
widely available antiviral drug, some virus researchers have worried
that the herpes virus would evolve into forms that could elude the
medicine and still cause disease.
   ``What we had feared for many years would happen now appears to
be happening, at least in the AIDS population,'' said Hirsch.
   Dr. M. Colin Jordan of the University of Minnesota, a co-author
of one of the studies, said he expects drug-resistant viruses to
complicate treatment of organ transplant patients. They must take
immunity-lowering drugs to keep their bodies from rejecting their
new organs.
   Since the drug-resistant viruses have not been seen in healthy
people, doctors cannot be sure whether the viruses will become a
problem for the general population.
   ``One concern is that someone with AIDS could give one of these
resistant viruses to someone else, and then it could become
established in the normal population,'' said Jordan.
   Dr. Clyde S. Crumpacker of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, another
co-author of the research, said he doubts this will happen.
   ``I have been aware of most of the cases of resistance that have
occurred, and it is an unlikely event,'' he said. ``It is not
occurring in the normal population that we have been watching.''

<HEAD>Marcos Supporter Acquitted In 1987 Takeover Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today acquitted a prominent
supporter of Ferdinand Marcos of rebellion, saying his takeover of a
provincial government during a 1987 coup attempt was not violent
enough to merit conviction.
   But Judge Maximiano Asuncion sentenced Orlando Dulay to 10 months
in prison and fined him the equivalent of $50 for trying to strangle
the governor and holding other officials and employees of Quirino
province during the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt, in which 53 people
were killed in Manila.
   It was the most serious of about a half-dozen coup attempts since
President Corazon Aquino rose to power in a February 1986 revolt
that sent Marcos into exile in Hawaii.
   Records of the case show that Dulay and about 50 rebel soldiers
and police barged into the capitol building in the Qurino provincial
capital of Cabarroguis and announced a takeover of the local
government.
   But in acquitting Dulay and four other defendants, Asuncion said
that announcing a takeover and appointing new officials ``are not
sufficient to hold them liable for the crime of rebellion.''
   ``To constitute rebellion, there must be some sort of public
uprising which is absent in the instant case,'' said the judge.
``And when we say public uprising, there must be men engaging in war
against the forces of government.''
   ``In order to commit the crime rebellion, there must be public
uprising and taking of arms against the government,'' the judge
added.
   Dulay has been in jail since March 1987 _ longer than his
sentence. But Asuncion did not order Dulay's release because he
faces charges of murdering two supporters of Mrs. Aquino during the
February 1986 presidential election.
   Dulay was in jail in Quirino, 100 miles north of Manila, pending
trial on the murder charges when the coup attempt began. Some of the
soldiers and policemen who preceded him to the capitol building
during the brief takeover were his prison guards.
   During the trial, prosecutors presented witnesses who described
how Dulay wrung the neck of Gov. Renicolas Delizo and yelled:
``Goddamn, you will die, I will kill you.'' Dulay, who was dressed
in military combat fatigues, then put a gun to Delizo's head, the
witnesses said.
   Dulay and his armed followers next herded Delizo and others into
the governor's office and held them there until midnight, when it
became clear in Manila that the coup attempt had failed.
   Dulay acknowledged that he grabbed Delizo by the neck but claimed
that was merely for ``psychological effect.''
   He also said it was not he was who tried to takeover Quirino.
   Dulay headed the provincial chapter of the New Society Movement
in Quirino.
   He and his followers were accused of murdering two civilians
campaigning for Mrs. Aquino in Quirino during the 1986 election
which both Mrs. Aquino and Marcos claimed they won.
   Dulay was arrested shortly after Marcos left, but escaped from a
suburban Manila military prison. He resurfaced in the United States
but was expelled back to Manila on March 18, 1987.
   Last June, armed men attacked the stockade at Manila's Camp
Crame, where Dulay was held, in what the military said was a bid to
free him. The group failed to free Dulay but looted the garrison's
armory.

   She said he ``now is a member of Nancy Reagan's `Just Say No'

has the DGA award winner failed to go on to win the Oscar for best
director.
   The nominees are: Alan Parker, for the civil rights saga
``Mississippi Burning''; Charles Crichton for the crime-caper comedy
``A Fish Called Wanda''; Barry Levinson for the brotherly love story
``Rain Man''; Robert Zemeckis for the semi-animated detective spoof
``Who Framed Roger Rabbit''; and Mike Nichols, for the corporate
comedy ``Working Girl.''
   ``I was hoping Clint Eastwood would be nominated this year, but
(his film `Bird') wasn't,'' said Steven Spielberg, who announced the
nominations Tuesday. ``I thought `Bird' was an outstanding
directorial accomplishment.''
   The winner will be announced March 11. All 9,000 guild members

   A scary moment on horseback during the filming of
``Lassie Comes Home'' led to Elizabeth Taylor's big breakthrough in
``National Velvet,'' her mother says.
   Sara Taylor, an actress herself, recalled the first day of

   Nine-year-old Elizabeth was riding a horse down a road when it
shied at a light reflector and reared.
   ``The cameras went on grinding and everyone stared in amazement
as that tiny little girl gently reined the frightened animal, calmed
him down, and brought him to the exact spot where she was supposed
to be; then she dismounted, opened the gate, and went on with the
scene as if nothing had happened,'' Mrs. Taylor wrote.
   ``The rest of us were shaking.''
   According to Mrs. Taylor: ``When the studio saw the rushes and
how she controlled and calmed that high-spirited horse, they
immediately said, `Here's the girl we have been searching for.' ''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Movie producer Alan Ladd Jr., who last year
quit his job as top moviemaker at MGM-UA Communications Co., has
formed a new movie company backed by Italian financier and Hollywood
buff Giancarlo Parretti.
   Ladd, who made his name guiding ``Star Wars'' through 20th
Century Fox when he was president there, will be chairman of the new
Pathe Entertainment Co. The company will produce 14 to 16 movies
during the next four years, he predicted Monday.
   The company apparently takes its name from Pathe France, a big
French movie company that Parretti and associated companies bought
last year.
   Parretti, who heads a partnership that controls 40 percent of
struggling moviemaker Cannon Group Inc., is rumored to be interested
in buying MGM-UA. Investor Kirk Kerkorian, who controls MGM-UA, has
the company up for sale, and has said he prefers to split the firm
and sell an interest in MGM.
   Ladd, son of the late actor and Marjorie Jane Ladd, resigned in
September as chairman of the MGM portion of MGM-UA amid the turmoil
brought on by Kerkorian's attempts to sell parts of the company.
   During his MGM tenure, he was credited with overseeing such
movies as ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' ``Willow,'' and ``Moonstruck.''
   Previously, his The Ladd Co. made two critically favored but
commercially unsuccessful movies, ``The Right Stuff'' and ``Blade
Runner,'' as well as such moneymakers as the ``Police Academy''
series.

   NBC extended its domination of the A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings to 32 weeks, and ABC dropped from first to third
in the news category.
   NBC's victory for the week that ended Sunday was accomplished
almost entirely with regular series programming. The week before NBC
won big with its coverage of the Super Bowl.
   NBC placed six prime-time shows in the top 10 last week. The
network did not have a single show in the bottom 25. Its only
non-regular show high in the ratings was the second half of the
miniseries ``Brotherhood of the Rose.'' The first part, which
followed the Super Bowl, was ninth the previous week.
   ``The Cosby Show'' on NBC was first, followed by ABC's
``Roseanne''; NBC's ``A Different World''; CBS' ``60 Minutes'';
ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''; NBC's ``Cheers''; CBS' ``Murder, She

   NBC's average prime-time rating for last week was 17.1; CBS' was
13.1 and ABC's was 12.0.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with an average of 15.7 to
ABC's 12.9 and CBS's 12.4.
   Each ratings point represents 904,000 homes with television.
   The ratings for the networks' nightly news shows were close
again, but CBS moved ahead of ABC, last week's winner, which fell to
third place. The ratings: CBS 11.7, NBC 11.6, ABC 11.5.
   ABC's ``Studio 5B'' on Sunday was the lowest-rated show among the
three networks. The five lowest network shows were ABC's
``Incredible Sunday,'' ABC's ``Murphy's Law,'' ABC's ``A Fine
Romance,'' CBS' ``TV 101'' and ABC's ``Studio 5B.''
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``America's Most Wanted'' was in 62 place,
placing higher than 10 shows from the networks. Fox's ``21 Jump
Street'' was 71st, which put it just ahead of ABC's ``A Fine
Romance.''

   Broadcaster Dorothy Hayden Cudahy was selected
Tuesday night as grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade, the
first woman chosen to lead the annual march in its 226-year history.
   Mrs. Cudahy was picked by about 600 delegates from the
approximately 200 affiliated organizations that march in the parade,
including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the United Irish Counties
and schools and fraternal organizations.
   ``It will be in honor of your mother and my mother and all the
Irish women who did so much,'' said Mrs. Cudahy, who is known as the
First Lady of Irish radio for her ``Irish Memories'' program, which
has been broadcast on New York area radio stations for more than 40
years.
   ``This achievement was really your achievement,'' she told the
delegates who crowded into a hotel ballroom in mid-Manhattan.
   A Bank of Ireland executive was elected grand marshal last year,
the third straight year Mrs. Cudahy had lost.

<TEXT>
   Armed with cash and cameras, foreign
trekkers by the thousands are scouring the hills of northern
Thailand for unspoiled tribal people, turning the region into ``a
human zoo,'' critics say.
   Thai officials, Christian missionaries and others interviewed say
these increasingly popular treks by Western Europeans, Americans and
Australians are hastening the erosion of traditional culture among
500,000 tribal people already reeling under rapid modernization.
   Villagers are selling their colorful costumes, jewelry and other
heirlooms or exchanging them for jeans and other Western goods
offered by trekkers. And intruding brusquely into village life are
some Westerners who, as former tour operator Bill Young recalls,
``run around with their breasts hanging out.''
   ``Nothing is free now. Their traditional hospitality has been
corrupted,'' says American missionary David Morse. ``Before they
would offer food and lodging to strangers. Now they no longer accept
people for who they are. They have become hardened, less open.''
   According to the government's tourist authority, tribal trekking
has grown from a handful of hikers in the 1970s to more than 100,000
last year.
   Most sign up with tour companies in this major northern Thai
city, then make their way by jeep, bamboo raft, elephant, motorcyle
or foot to the hill villages of the Akha, Karen, Hmong, Lisu, Lahu
and other tribes.
   The trekking companies capitalize on the region's natural beauty
and the lure of the exotic and notorious _ the area is part of the
so-called Golden Triangle of opium fields and warlord armies.
   ``Padaung hill tribes now available,'' reads one typical
advertisement, which has prompted critics to charge that the tribal
people are being marketed like animals on a safari or in a zoo.
   Young, a longtime American resident of northern Thailand, says
trekking agencies vary greatly.
   Some, he says, educate clients about local cultures while others
may offer an ``opium experience'' and provide opportunities for
``authentic'' photographs by getting tribesmen to smoke their opium
pipes or engage in courtship rituals.
   Some trekkers have died of drug overdoses. Violence and robbery
against tourists _ once unheard of _ are on the rise as cultures
clash and cash is haphazardly injected into primitive economies.
   Suppakit Apasil, director of the government's tourism office in
Chiang Mai, says part of the trouble stems from lack of controls
over the mushrooming agencies and the trekking industry, which
brings $5 million annually to the city.
   Chiang Mai has 110 agencies, some no more than a table in a
restaurant catering to backpackers, offering tours that range from
$6 to $100 and guides whose knowledge of tribal languages and lore
varies as widely.
   The government has no regulatory powers but provides would-be
trekkers with a list of warnings and recommendations and helped
organize a Jungle Tour Club, an association of about 50 trekking
outfits that attempts to raise standards.
   Wanat Bruksasri, who heads the Hill Tribe Research Institute,
lists tourism among factors changing hill tribe life. Other factors
are greater road access, population growth, an influx of lowlanders
and the impact of foreign and Thai development agencies.
   ``See real primitive hill tribes in the Thai jungle, if you're
looking for an intensive and unforgettable experience,'' announces
one trekking company. But some who sign up are in for a
disappointment.
   After a long walk through deforested hills, trekkers may well
come upon a village where the natives watch television, drive
Japanese pick-up trucks and wear jeans purchased from previous
trekkers.

<HEAD>Administration Reluctantly Supports Cutting Deduction on Debt</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX9</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is giving qualified
support to cutting the tax deduction for interest on debt incurred
in leveraged buyouts, saying it prefers fairer tax treatment of
traditional forms of raising capital.
   ``If you're going to make a change _ and clearly we're not
suggesting one _ we would suggest that you look in the area of
perhaps limiting interest deductions and using that money to give a
break to corporate owners of stock,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady told the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday.
   Brady said the ``driving force'' behind the LBO phenomenon is
that companies can avoid a 34 percent corporate income tax rate by
raising capital through debt rather than stock.
   He said the Treasury Department also has been attempting to find
a way through Internal Revenue Service regulations or a legislative
proposal to make the tax treatment of stock-equity and bond-debt
financing more equal.
   ``The LBO problem would disappear with a level playing field,''
he said. ``But so far we haven't been able to come up with a way to
do it.''
   Brady also suggested that the best action might be inaction.
   ``We have a habit of correcting things just as they are about to
correct themselves,'' Brady said. ``If we wait a little longer, this
thing is not going to gobble us up.''
   But Brady conceded the administration is concerned about the
rapid rate with which companies are going into debt to launch
takeovers or defend against them through stock buybacks _ both often
financed by high-interest junk bonds.
   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, likened Brady's qualified endorsement
of taxing interest on takeover-related debt to ``a kiss through a
veil'' and criticized him for not coming up with specific
suggestions or data on the impact of the buyouts on the federal
treasury.
   With a ``that depends'' answer, Brady evaded a question on
whether President Bush's desire to reduce the capital gains tax
would only encourage more buyouts since shareholders would have to
pay less tax on the 35 percent to 45 percent above-market prices
they often get in the transactions.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said it is ironic the outcry for
congressional action to curb takeovers ``has become deafening'' in
the past 16 months.
   In 1987 the House had approved similar legislation to limit the
tax deductibility of interest on junk bonds and other borrowing used
in financing takeovers.
   But it suffered a quick death in negotiations with the Senate
after then-Treasury Secretary and now Secretary of State James A.
Baker tried to blame the bill as the cause of the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   Since then, the size of companies being taken over through junk
bonds has increased several times. And instead of just plants
closing and workers losing jobs, owners of more traditional
long-term, investment-grade bonds in the companies being acquired
have seen the value of their holdings diminished in some takeovers.
   For example, holders of some $5 billion in long-term bonds in
RJR-Nabisco Co., lost $1 billion overnight when credit agencies
downgraded their rating upon the announcement of the company's
takeover by LBO specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Rostenkowski and other lawmakers also have questioned whether
many of the newly restructured companies will be able to make the
interest payments on their much higher debt and avoid bankruptcy if
and when a recession occurs.
   ``I have a feeling that we're looking at a Richter scale that's
showing zero and then we have an eruption of 7 or 8 on the scale and
it's too late,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., using a major
earthquake as a metaphor.

<HEAD>Watergate Jury Selection a Model for North's Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Watergate cases of the mid-1970s could
provide a road map for selection of a jury in Oliver North's trial
that will not be biased by pretrial publicity, legal experts say.
   ``I would say Watergate is your best guide. From what I can
understand the Iran-Contra hearings won't exceed publicity of
that,'' says Professor William Greenhalgh of the Georgetown
University Law Center.
   There are important parallels between the prosecution of the
leading Watergate defendants and North's case, Greenhalgh said
Tuesday. Most notably, he said, the trials in both instances were
preceded by congressional hearings that attracted vast television
audiences.
   A federal appeals court upheld the Watergate convictions, saying
the defendants' rights were protected by the careful questioning of
prospective jurors to guard against prejudice from pretrial
publicity.
   ``That's what (U.S. District Judge Gerhard) Gesell is doing
now,'' Greenhalgh said. ``He has a road map. And if he's following
it I think he'll be all right.''
   Professor David Robinson Jr. of George Washington University
agreed. ``We have an imperfect system that stumbles through,'' he
said. ``It's not an impossibility to get a jury'' in the North trial
that will be unbiased.
   Robinson also said it is easier to guard against prejudiced
jurors in federal cases because the judges generally do the
questioning in empaneling jurors. In the state courts, he said, the
quizzing is done by the lawyers on each side.
   As North's trial began Tuesday, Gesell said there may be problems
finding an impartial jury as required by the Constitution because so
many people have seen or read of North's testimony in congressional
hearings.
   Only 16 of the first 54 prospective jurors indicated on
questionnaires that they weren't exposed to North's congressional
appearances, the judge said.
   North, a former White House aide, testified to House and Senate
investigating committees in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity.
The immunity grant meant the congressional testimony itself could
not be used to prosecute North, although independent counsel
Laurence Walsh was free to develop the same information
independently.
   Gesell noted that North's trial on charges of lying to Congress,
shredding evidence and conspiring to commit tax fraud comes after
intense publicity, and the judge said the spotlight will remain on
throughout the trial.
   Gesell said he will rule Wednesday on how much exposure to such
publicity ought to be allowed before a possible juror is
disqualified.
   North himself has contributed to the attention his trial is
receiving. In recent months, he has been giving speeches for $20,000
fees.
   The Supreme Court has made it clear that pretrial publicity is
not necessarily fatal to a fair trial.
   The justices' most recent ruling on the issue was in 1984 when,
by a 6-2 vote, they reinstated the murder conviction of a
Pennsylvania high school teacher for raping and strangling a student.
   The court stressed in that case that the conviction came years
after the offense occurred, allowing ample time for the community's
sense of outrage to cool.
   Justice Lewis F. Powell, writing for the court, said the trial
judge has broad discretion to decide whether prospective jurors are
biased.
   ``Under our system it is that judge who is best situated to
determine competency to serve impartially,'' Powell said.
   The high court in 1961 provided some guidelines for permissible
pretrial publicity.
   Justice Tom C. Clark, writing for the court then, said it is not
necessary for jurors to ``be totally ignorant of the facts and
issues involved.'' He said requiring them to know nothing would
amount to an ``impossible'' standard.

   Mayor Gemiliano Lopez has nipped
noon-time nipping by revoking the liquor licenses of restaurants
near city hall after complaints that municipal workers were
returning from lunch breaks drunk.
   Lopez's order, issued Tuesday, canceled the liquor licenses of
about 30 restaurants within 200 yards of city hall. Lopez ordered
officials not to issue new licenses to restaurants on three major
streets near his office.
   The mayor also issued a directive warning city employees that he
would not tolerate alcohol abuse.
   A city ordinance already banned liquor sales within 200 yards of
public buildings, churches and schools but officials said the
Department of Tourism had exempted establishments near city hall
because they ostensibly catered mostly to tourists.

   Ranchers armed with blankets and shovels
helped more than 100 firefighters battle a prairie fire that raced
through the Panhandle Tuesday, consuming 8,000 acres of grassland,
farm buildings and at least one home.
   Firefighters said a 25-foot wall of flames was fueled by winds
gusting in excess of 45 mph as it made its way across Morrill and
Garden counties for more than eight hours into Tuesday night.
   No injuries were reported. Some hot spots were still burning late
Tuesday night, but authorities said the fire was under control by
about 8:30 p.m.
   Ken Loxterkamp, Broadwater's assistant fire chief, said minimal
damage was reported because few buildings exist in the area.
   ``This is all ranch country. It's all grassland. It burned up
into some of the yards. In one place there were two houses in the
same area. They saved the one house but lost the other,'' Loxterkamp
said.
   He said more than 100 firefighters were at the scene at one time.
   Cyndi Messersmith of the Alliance Fire Department said the fire
started east of Angora about noon and burned more than 8,000 acres.
   Most of the damage to farm buildings, including the burned house,
was reported north of Bridgeport, about 25 miles south of Alliance.
   Al Kosel of the National Weather Service in Scottsbluff said
winds across the Panhandle gusted at up to 47 mph Tuesday afternoon.
He said conditions had been very dry in the area.
   ``We had only a trace of precipitation all month,'' he said.

   There is no proven link between alcoholic

Tuesday said recommendations by a U.S. Surgeon General's workshop
that restrictions be placed on alcohol ads were a well-meaning but
constitutionally unsupportable attack on commercial speech.
   Wallace S. Snyder of the American Advertising Federation said the
workshop recommendations ``are clearly unconstitutional and
discriminatory because of a lack of evidence showing any link
between alcoholic beverage advertising and consumption, let alone
abuse.''
   ``We're really concerned that censorship of truthful advertising
is contagious, and we would be on a slippery slope, and all sorts of
product advertising would come under fire,'' Snyder said.
   Restricting ads does not get at the root causes of drunkenness _
a problem that must be approached by expanded public education, the
groups said.
   At a news conference, industry representatives attacked the
recommendations presented to Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in
December by a workshop on drunken driving. The broadcasters and
advertisers said they were writing to Koop to urge him, as one
official put it, to reject ``these hasty and misguided proposals.''
   The NAB and the advertising industry declined to participate in
the workshop last year, claiming it was stacked against advertisers'
interests.
   Advertising of alcoholic beverages on radio and television
totaled $931 million in 1987, the NAB said. The industry
representatives Tuesday said they stood ready to increase their
campaigns against alcohol abuse.
   Snyder said he hoped Koop would recognize the anti-drunkenness
efforts being made by the advertising industry and ``not to get into
a confrontational mode but to try to solve this problem by talking.''
   ``Banning alcohol advertising and marketing will have no effect
on the drunk driving problem other than to provide false
satisfaction that something is being done,'' NAB President Edward O.
Fritts said in a statement.
   ``Research shows that the first step toward solving the tragedy
of drunk driving is to make drunkenness socially unacceptable,''
Fritts said. ``Attempts to scapegoat any one element of society are
counterproductive and, in the workshop's case, totally without
merit.''
   However, the presidential National Commission Against Drunk
Driving reported in December that teen-agers testified during public
hearings ``with near unanimity'' that advertising encourages
adolescents to drink. The commission said drunken driving was the
No. 1 killer of teens.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control said 23,632 people were
killed in the United States in 1987 in vehicular accidents in which
alcohol was involved.
   The workshop's recommendations to Koop included banning alcohol
ads and promotion and sponsorship of public events where the
majority of the audience is under the legal drinking age;
elimination of advertising that portrays activities that are
combined with alcohol use; banning sponsorship of athletic events by
the alcoholic beverage industry; and blocking the use of celebrities
who have a strong appeal to young people in alcohol advertising and
promotion.
   NAB representative Chuck Sherman said the NAB had recommended to
Koop that:
   _Broadcasting's ongoing public service announcements campaign
``should be broadened and developed to make the public aware that
getting drunk is socially unacceptable.''
   _An education campaign should be developed to explain the
difference between taking a drink and getting drunk.
   _Individuals ``can and should be trained and educated to
recognize an impending intoxication in others _ and trained to
intervene effectively.''
   _``Families must be taught that education about drinking
practices begins at home.''
   _Incentives should be promoted to encourage anti-drunkenness
efforts.
   Jim Brown, a spokesman for the Public Health Service, said Koop
would have no immediate comment on the comments by the broadcasters
and advertisers. He said Koop would review the panel's
recommendations and public comments and then issue his own views.

<HEAD>1989 Begins with Higher Prices Received by Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's farmers began 1989 on a price
upswing that saw them receiving more for their cattle, hogs,
tomatoes and wheat, according to preliminary January figures by the
Agriculture Department.
   On the average, prices that farmers got for raw products
increased 1.4 percent from December to January, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said Tuesday.
   As always, there were losers as well as gainers, with grapefruit,
oranges, peanuts and strawberries commanding lower prices. But even
so, the USDA's overall price index was up 12 percent from a year
earlier.
   New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet
expenses rose 1.2 percent from October and averaged 6.1 percent more
than a year ago. Higher prices for feeder stock, including pigs and
cattle, along with higher calf prices accounted for most of the rise
since last fall.
   In a related report, the board said preliminary figures showed
last year's corn production, which was shriveled nearly a third by
drought and heat, had a value of more than $13 billion, an average
of $2.60 per bushel. That was down from almost $14 billion in 1987,
when the crop averaged only $1.94 per bushel.
   The value is USDA's estimate of how much a crop is worth, whether
a farmer sells it for cash or feeds it to livestock.
   Soybeans were valued at almost $11.9 billion, an average of $7.70
per bushel, compared with $11.3 billion and $5.88 in 1987. Wheat was
third at $6.63 billion and $3.70 per bushel, compared with a 1987
value of $5.5 billion and $2.57 per bushel.
   According to the preliminary January price figures, based mostly
on midmonth averages, the index for livestock and livestock products
as a group rose 1.9 percent from their December average and was up
6.8 percent from January 1988.
   The department's all-crops price index for January rose 0.7
percent from December and was up 20 percent from a year earlier.
Prices of food grains were up 3.2 percent from December. Wheat
prices rose 14 cents per bushel from December to $4.08 in January,
the highest since March 1981. Rice dropped 8 cents per 100 pounds to
$6.52 per hundredweight.
   Prices of commercial vegetables rose 8.2 percent from December,
with tomatoes and sweet corn leading the increase.
   The all-fruit price index dropped 6.8 percent from December but
still averaged 16.2 percent more than in January 1988.
   Oranges dropped to $6.20 per box from $6.50 in December but were
up from $5.64 a year earlier. Grapefruit declined to $3.72 per box
from $4.71 in December and $5.63 in January 1988.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $48
billion to $58 billion this year, compared with a near-record of $57
billion in 1988. That is the difference between cash receipts and
cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier
production items.
   Food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 3.7 percent, and
USDA analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is
likely in 1989.

      WASHINGTON (AP) _ An Agriculture Department survey shows that
wind damage to land in the Great Plains is up sharply from the
relatively moderate losses of a year ago, mostly because of the 1988
drought.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said Tuesday nearly 2.2 million acres were reported damaged
in November and December, up more than 80 percent from 1.2 million
acres in the same two months of 1987.
   ``A lot of the damage is a result of drought,'' Scaling said.
``The reasons vary by area, but major factors are lack of (crop)
residue and poor vegetative cover _ both caused by a lack of
moisture.''
   Scaling said more than 80 percent of the land reported damaged
was cropland, the remainder primarily rangeland.
   Texas accounted for more than 30 percent of the erosion damage in
November and December with 664,128 acres.
   Scaling said that in addition to the damaged land in November and
December, nearly 19 million acres were ``in condition to blow,''
with five months still remaining in the critical wind season.
   November and December are the first two months of an annual
seven-month season when winds are highest and the soils are driest
in the Great Plains. Surveys were made in 541 counties of the
10-state region.
   Although the 1987-88 season began with relatively light damage,
it picked up as moisture conditions worsened. When the season ended
last May 31, more than 13 million acres had been damaged, the
second-largest acreage since SCS began records in 1935.
   The most widespread was in 1955 when about 16 million acres of
Great Plains land were damaged by wind. Another bad year was 1980-81
when 12.5 million acres were damaged.
   According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing
damaged acres in November and December with the damage during the
same two months of 1987-88, included:
   _Colorado, 28,795 acres damaged this season and 17,070 in 1987-88.
   _Kansas, 135,550 and 31,520.
   _Montana, 510,875 and 304,023.
   _Nebraska, 54,405 and 74,590.
   _New Mexico, 51,100 and 3,300.
   _North Dakota, 188,200 and 230,000.
   _Oklahoma, 68,480 and 31,288.
   _South Dakota, 112,250 and 69,400.
   _Texas, 664,128 and 250,220.
   _Wyoming, 346,754 and 190,885.

<HEAD>White House, Wright Reach Accord on Timely Notification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House will put off legislation tightening
congressional control over covert intelligence actions and instead
rely on the Bush administration's good faith to keep lawmakers
informed about such activity, says Speaker Jim Wright.
   Wright made the offer Tuesday to Bush's new secretary of state,
James A. Baker III, at a meeting designed to open doors to the
administration and lay the groundwork for bipartisan cooperation on
foreign policy.
   In return, Wright said Baker promised him that the administration
``will abide by the letter and the spirit of the law'' that requires
the president to give Congress timely notice of planned covert
actions overseas.
   That law has been a sore point in congressional-administration
relations, especially since the Iran-Contra affair, when President
Reagan failed for more than 10 months to tell Congress about arms
sales to Iran designed to win freedom for American hostages.
   ``It was the intent of Congress that `timely' should mean hours,
or days at most, not weeks or months,'' Wright said.
   Legislation that grew out of Congress' Iran-Contra investigation
was introduced last year to erase the law's ambiguity over what
constitutes ``timely'' notice by placing a firm 48-hour notification
requirement on the president.
   The bill's primary sponsor, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said he
had no problem with Wright's pledge so long as the White House
voluntarily honors the 48-hour standard in all but the most extreme
circumstances where notice is impossible.
   The Senate passed the measure last year, but it was pulled from
the House calendar late in the year after Wright ran into
accusations that he had improperly publicly disclosed a covert CIA
operation in Nicaragua.
   A House ethics committee inquiry into Wright's conduct remains
open.
   ``There is no point in opening old wounds if we can start afresh
and act on a mutual assumption of good faith,'' Wright told
reporters.
   Wright also set up a bipartisan task force to meet with Baker and
arrange regular consultation between the administration and Congress
on foreign policy matters, trying to head off the confrontations
that dogged relations between Capitol Hill and the Reagan White
House.
   The task force he created includes House Majority Leader Tom
Foley, D-Wash., Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell,
D-Fla., Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, and
Intelligence Committee Chairman Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif.
Republican members are to be appointed by House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   Their job will be to meet with Baker periodically to find ways to
build trust and overcome longstanding disputes with the executive
branch, including the circumstances under which U.S. military forces
will be deployed and the notification issue in covert operations
cases, Wright said.
   He said Baker is seeking a mechanism by which the two branches
can work out diputes over the War Powers Act and avoid the
constitutional collision over congressional and White House
authority that can occur when the president deploys U.S. troops.
   ``We've begun a process which may be constructive,'' Wright said,
one which he hopes will ``reduce the level of confrontation that has
sometimes marred our relationships in the past couple of years.''

   An unwed couple expecting their third
child ``are creating children for the welfare rolls,'' a federal
judge said in blocking their request to overturn an agency's ban on
housing unmarried couples.
   U.S. District Judge Ronald R. Lagueux also suggested that Dana
Dagnese leave the family so that Susan Arsenau and the children
could meet the Woonsocket Housing Authority's regulation, said
Steven Brown of the American Civil Liberties Union's Rhode Island
chapter.
   The couple, who have lived together six years, filed a federal
lawsuit two weeks ago saying the authority's decision to deny them
emergency housing violated their rights to ``freedom of association,
family privacy and equal protection of laws.''
   The couple were seeking a preliminary injuction Tuesday. No trial
date has been set.
   ``Under our policy, boyfriends are not allowed, and they are not
part of the family,'' said Ernest Lafond, the housing authority's
executive director.
   The agency's attorney argued that the couple could neither show a
husband and wife, nor a common-law relationship, said Lafond.
   But it was Lagueux who said the relationship was adulterous and
against the state's public policy, according to Brown, whose ACLU
chapter is assisting the couple.
   ``Here is a couple in an illicit relationship, who are creating
children for the welfare rolls, while others who qualify for housing
are shunted aside,'' the judge said Tuesday.
   ``Wouldn't the court look silly asking the authority to foster
these people and allow them to continue an illegal relationship?''
   Dagnese, who has been separated from his wife for almost a
decade, is awaiting completion of his divorce, Brown said. They have
a 3-year-old daughter and a year-old son and are expecting a child
in March.
   ``I have to tell my kids that this is not their father because
we're not married?'' Arsenau asked. ``They're still his kids and
he's still their father.''
   ``There's no difference. You're still together,'' Dagnese said.
``The only difference is a piece of paper.''
   The couple was ordered to leave their rented apartment Dec. 15
because of safety hazards in the building, said Brown. The agency
denied them emergency shelter soon thereafter.
   Arsenau had the opportunity to request an informal hearing to
discuss the situation or to complain to a formal grievance panel
after her application was rejected, but did neither, the housing
agency director said.
   Arsenau, who is bedridden because of her pregnancy, testified she
and the children have been sleeping in the living room of a friend's
apartment. Dagnese, who recently lost his job with a dairy company,
usually sleeps in his car or with other friends, she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several major campaign promises by President
Bush are likely to be missing or significantly scaled back in the
budget proposal he will make to Congress next week, administration
officials say.
   Campaign pledges for a major expansion of Medicaid and increased
funding for several education programs are among those likely to
fall victim to concern about the federal deficit, said the
officials, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
   Bush does plan to propose several tax breaks, the officials said,
but the scope of a proposed capital-gains rate cut remains undecided.
   Bush has long advocated a reduction in the capital gains tax _
the tax on profits from the sale of homes, stocks and other assets _
to a maximum of 15 percent. But senior aides said Treasury officials
are having a hard time coming up with a formula, and the final
proposal could call for lower rates for one category than for
another.
   Bush campaign promises on education including a $500 million
National Merit scholarship program, an expansion of the Head Start
program and a $50 million increase in school experimentation may be
pruned back considerably, the officials said.
   They also said Bush's campaign proposal to expand Medicaid
coverage to more lower-income Americans and to allow low-paid
workers to purchase it is being given a low priority in budget
preparation talks.
   Budget constraints make fulfillment of such promises unlikely,
the officials said.
   ``The two have to be reconciled,'' said a senior White House
official who insisted upon anonymity.
   Bush has promised to propose a budget that does not contain a tax
increase while meeting the Gramm-Rudman law requirement for reducing
the deficit to $100 billion or less.
   The officials said that Bush's budget, to be unveiled Feb. 9 when
he addresses a joint session of Congress, will include these
proposals:
   _A child-care tax credit of up to $1,000 per child for low-income
families, generally those earning less than $10,000 a year.
   _New tax incentives for oil and gas exploration, likely coupled
with a call for removal of all remaining price controls on natural
gas, now affecting about 40 percent of production.
   _A proposal for tax-free ``enterprise zones'' to be established
in some inner city areas to promote commercial growth, a program
championed by Bush's nominee for Housing and Urban Development
secretary, Jack Kemp.
   Administration officials are still wrestling with terms of a
package to help bail out troubled savings and loans, and it appeared
likely that some variation on a proposal for an increased fee for
deposit insurance would be part of the new Bush budget plan.
   Bush himself has said that a proposal for a reduced capital-gains
tax rate will be part of his Feb. 9 rewrite of the $1.15 trillion
budget President Reagan submitted last month for fiscal 1990.
   However, sources say there is still disagreement over exactly
what form the tax cut should take.
   Bush and other advocates of a lower capital gains tax say it
would boost the economy by increasing business investment. Opponents
say it would be a tax break for the rich that also would worsen the
federal deficit.
   Capital gains are currently taxed at the same level as other
income, at 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on
overall income. Bush would like to lower the rate to a flat 15
percent.
   Bush claims that, instead of costing the government money, such a
move would spur investment and generate up to $4 billion a year in
new revenue.
   However, many leading economists, including the bipartisan
Congressional Budget Office, say lowering the tax would have the
opposite effect _ reducing revenues and further worsening the
deficit.
   That's because some capital gains _ such as the profits raised
from the sale of private homes or objects of art _ are unlikely to
be funneled into business investment.
   Under existing law, homeowners can generally escape the capital
gains tax by plowing their profits into another home, and there is a
one-time exemption from the tax for homeowners over age 55.

<HEAD>Memory of Ill Son Led to 40 Years of Help for Children's Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A father's memory of being worried sick about
his injured son but too poor to pay the hospital bill inspired a
newspaper column that has raised millions of dollars over the past
40 years to help care for needy youngsters.
   The father _ and the columnist _ was Bill Gold of The Washington
Post. He is now 76 and retired, missing one kidney and forbidden to
smoke his beloved cigars after open-heart surgery. ``God, I miss
'em,'' he says.
   But Gold still likes to tell funny stories, and he still
cherishes his favorite charity.
   He and Bob Levey, who succeeded Gold in writing the daily column
eight years ago, were hosts at a thank-you party Tuesday night for
some of the thousands of readers who answered their appeals for
donations to Children's Hospital over the years.
   Among the guests was Bonnie Biermann of suburban Alexandria, Va.,
who spent five months in the hospital in 1964-65 as a 13-year-old
undergoing extensive brain surgery.
   Bonnie, who is confined to a wheelchair, recently mailed Levey a
$7 check, ``which I hope will help in a small way.''
   Also at the party was John Reed, 8, who will undergo his 15th
operation at Children's next Monday for multiple birth defects.
``We've spent our life savings on surgery,'' said his mother, Dianna
Reed of Silver Spring, Md. ``If we ever get him through this, we'll
contribute freely.''
   Officials at Children's Hospital say the private, non-profit
facility in northeast Washington provides $25 million in free
medical care each year to children whose parents are too poor to pay
the full costs of treatment.
   Without $4.5 million in voluntary donations last year, officials
said, the hospital would have shown a deficit.
   Gold's column, ``The District Line,'' a chronicle of hometown
happenings that never make Page One, first appeared in the Post on
Jan. 13, 1947. Not long afterward, a woman wrote to advertise some
giveaway pets and enclosed a dollar ``for your favorite charity.''
   Gold searched the city for a worthy cause. He said he was
impressed by Children's Hospital, partly because it was chartered in
1860 _ before the Civil War _ to provide medical care for ``indigent
children of every race and creed.''
   Gold said he recalled an earlier time, when he was the hungry
young news director of a Cincinnati radio station and rushed his
2-year-old son to the local children's hospital. It was so
dilapidated it had been condemned by the fire marshal, he said.
   Standing in the similar disrepair of Children's Hospital 40 years
ago, Gold said, ``it was very easy to remember when I didn't have
two quarters to rub together and was afraid my kid had a fractured
skull. It made me feel that this is where I belong.''
   The column has raised some $6 million for the hospital since then.
   Looking back, Gold said he'd make the same choice today.
   ``I know of no other place where they take the child first, make
sure he's cared for, and then ask the parents whether they can
pay,'' he said.
   Although he's on ``everybody's sucker list'' and must turn down
some charitable appeals, Gold said ``it's very difficult to say I
need this money more than Children's Hospital. Anyone who can't
respond to the needs of sick children is a pretty sad character.''

   Authorities have discovered the bodies
of six people who were shot in the head with a shotgun near a
trailer compound, and one of the residents has been charged with two
of the deaths.
   The body of a man found Tuesday in the rusted hull of a car in a
junkyard near the three-trailer compound appeared to have been shot
twice in the back of the head at close range, said Assistant State
Medical Examiner Dr. Vasudeo Kshirsagar.
   The condition of the body indicated that the victim had been dead
several months, Kshirsagar said, adding that the five others
appeared to have been killed in a similar manner.
   ``It was a shotgun. It was consistent with the other cases,''
said Kanawha County Sheriff Art Ashley.
   Police believe the body is that of 20-year-old Michael Schillings
of North Carolina, who came to the compound to live last spring and
was reported missing last summer.
   On Monday, the body of 22-year-old Jimmy Price was found on the
site about 30 feet from the car, authorities said. The junkyard is
about 200 yards east of the compound, where the first two bodies
were discovered Jan. 8.
   If all six bodies are linked to the same killer, it would be the
worst series of deaths in West Virginia attributed to the same
person.
   Authorities said 19-year-old Mark Southern McCallister is being
held without bond on charges of murdering brothers Billy and Otis
Sanson, who lived with McCallister at the compound in St. Albans, a
town of 15,000 people 15 miles west of Charleston.
   Prosecutors said McCallister has confessed to the brothers'
murders.
   Police found the body of the Sansons' sister, Bonnie Pauley, at
an abandoned motel across the street from the compound on Jan. 21.
Another victim, McCallister's grandmother, Charlotte Farrell, 69,
was found in her nearby home.
   ``We hope this ight wrap up the investigation from the standpoint
of looking for people,'' Ashley said.
   The sheriff's department declined to say whether McCallister
would be charged in the other deaths or to speculate on a motive.
   However, authorities said all the victims lived at the compound,
which is now abandoned, and Price and Schillings had dated Bonnie
Pauley.

   A man who got stuck inside a church
chimney died slowly as his body cooked during a two-day period,
police said.
   ``We don't know if he suffocated from carbon monoxide or if the
heat got to him. The heat could have gotten to between 1,200 and
1,500 degrees, so it had to have been a horrifying death,'' said
Sgt. Richard Andress. ``His body didn't burn. It cooked. The body
literally cooked or baked.''
   Keeno E. Exum, 27, was found Monday inside the 30-foot-high
chimney of Mount Sinai Baptist Church. The body was about 5 feet
from the base when police went to investigate complaints that smoke
and soot were spewing from the building's furnaces, authorities said.
   ``It's unbelievable how he even got in there. Once you get in
there, you can't get out,'' Andress said.
   The chimney was 16-by-16 inches in diameter, said Andress, who
did not know what the man was doing in the chimney.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is naming Undersecretary of
State Michael H. Armacost the new U.S. ambassador to Japan, where he
will grapple with touchy trade and defense issues.
   Armacost, 51, is the highest-ranking foreign service officer in
the State Department. If confirmed by the Senate, he will succeed
Mike Mansfield, a former Senate Democratic leader who was the
ambassador for a record 11 years before retiring last November at
age 85.
   Bush's selection of Armacost was confirmed Tuesday by a U.S.
official who declined to be identified, after reports of the pending
nomination circulated in Japan.
   Three other diplomatic selections also surfaced: Bernard Aronson
for the sensitive job of Assistant Secretary of State for
Inter-American Affairs, Richard T. McCormack to be Undersecretary of
State for Economic Affairs and John Negroponte to be U.S. ambassador
to Mexico.
   Aronson is a Democrat who broke with the majority of his party to
support U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. McCormack is currently
assigned to the Inter-American bureau. Negroponte, deputy national
security adviser, was a candidate to succeed Armacost.
   Armacost is a former U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and was
the ranking Asian specialist on the National Security Council staff
in 1978-1979, during the Carter administration.
   He has held a Pentagon post as well, serving as deputy assistant
secretary of defense in 1979-80.
   U.S. relations with Tokyo are at a crucial stage, with pressure
building in Congress to have the Japanese increase their
contribution to the country's defense. Another problem in the
relationship is the U.S. trade deficit of $57 billion caused by an
influx of Japanese products.
   Under former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Armacost played
a key role in dealing with Soviet authorities on regional disputes
in Afghanistan, southwest Africa, Cambodia and Central America.
   And Armacost, in a memorandum to Shultz on July 2, 1986,
counseled him to oppose former President Reagan's surreptitious plan
to send U.S. missiles to Iran in an effort to free American hostages.
   ``This seems scarcely a propitious moment to send arms to Teheran
and it has never been clear the Iranians we are dealing with are
going to possess any clout in a post-Khomeini Iran,'' Armacost wrote.
   An imposing 6-footer, Armacost has a quiet demeanor and low-key
style.
   Twenty years ago, he served in Tokyo as a visiting professor of
international relations at the International Christian University,
and from 1972 to 1974 he was a special assistant in the U.S. embassy
there.
   Armacost is a graduate of Carleton College and Columbia
University. He is married and has three children.
   He is expected to be succeeded in the job of undersecretary of
state for political affairs by Robert Kimmet, a Washington lawyer.
Bush is breaking precedent by not naming a career diplomat to the
No. 3 job at the State Department, but Lawrence Eagleburger, a
former foreign service officer with 37 years' experience, is to be
nominated Deputy Secretary of State.
   McCormack is a former ambassador to the Organization of American
States and has politically conservative views.
   Aronson, on the other hand, is a Democrat who shifted from
skepticism about U.S. support for the Contra rebels to supporting
the Reagan administration's program.
   A Democratic Senate source, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said the choice had been made because Aronson was a
moderate who could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans on
divisive Central American policies, and Nicaragua in particular.
   Aronson would succeed Elliott Abrams in the post. Abrams was an
ardent champion of the Contras who clashed with Democrats in
Congress over what many considered to be misleading testimony about
the secret U.S. program to finance the Nicaraguan rebels with funds
solicited from foreign governments.
   Meanwhile, a White House source said Bush was expected to name
Negroponte ambassador to Mexico. Negroponte, a former ambassador to
Honduras, also has served in a variety of foreign posts, including
in Hong Kong, Vietnam and Ecuador.

   Turks and Germans nod politely to each other on the
streets of West Berlin's predominantly Turkish neighborhood, but a
current of mistrust sometimes runs beneath the outer friendliness.
   That uneasiness seems to have intensified now that a far-right
party which suggests foreigners do not belong in West Germany has
won seats in the city's legislature _ its first electoral victory on
the state level.
   Turks and other non-Germans living in this city are worried by
the Republicans' sudden emergence as a serious political party.
   ``The Republicans did not win so many seats in the legislature,
but we are very concerned they could become stronger in the
future,'' said Zafer Oeztuerk, a university student from Turkey.
   West Berlin has a reputation for a liberal attitude toward the
non-Germans who stream into the city, and many Berliners took to the
streets to express dismay after the Republicans captured 7.5 percent
of Sunday's vote, or 11 of the legislature's 134 seats.
   An estimated 15,000 people protested outside City Hall on Monday,
demanding the outlawing of the 5-year-old party, whose national
chairman is former Nazi SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber.
   Many conservative West Berliners, however, say they have nothing
against foreigners but believe it unfair to give non-Germans jobs
and apartments when the city has a housing shortage and 11 percent
unemployment.
   Analysts think the Republicans were able to pick up so many votes
because the governing Christian Democrats have failed to address
their conservative constituents' concerns about the growing number
of foreigners _ mostly Turks _ who are competing with Germans for
jobs, housing and social services.
   ``It appears that the vote for the Republicans was more of a
protest vote,'' Richard Stoess, a political scientist at West
Berlin's Free University told the Berlin Morgenpost newspaper.
   An estimated 262,000 foreigners live in West Berlin, a city of 2
million residents surrounded by East Germany. More than half are
Turks.
   Many of the Turks live in Southeast 36, a section of the huge
working-class Kreuzberg district that a visitor might mistake for
Istanbul if not for the German cars and tavern signs advertising
local beers.
   Women draped in traditional shawls ply the sidewalk outside drab
shops and ethnic food stores, bantering with clerks and customers in
Turkish.
   Turks who live in West Berlin say they were shocked when they
heard the Republicans had won seats in the legislature, and angrily
defend their right to live in the city.
   ``We couldn't believe this happened,'' said Tuncay Yueksel, who
runs a Turkish bakery. ``I am a German, and so are my wife and
children. We belong here,'' he said in fluent German.
   Yueksel said Germans and Turks live alongside each other in
Southeast 36 and get along well, a feeling echoed by a German man at
a neighborhood cafe.
   But a middle-aged German grocer said ``there are too many
foreigners''
   She said she had voted for the Republicans.
   ``This neighborhood was once all German, but they started moving
out when Turks started moving in. We've become foreigners here, in
our own neighborhood,'' she said.
   ``Look, I am certainly not a Nazi, and the Republicans are not
Nazis either. I was only a child when Hitler was in power, but I
know those were bad times,'' said the woman.
   ``But the Republicans were saying the right things. It's not
right when foreigners collect social assistance that we provide with
our taxes.''
   The woman refused to give her name, saying, ``That could be bad
for my business.''
   The election has unified West Berlin's non-Germans.
   ``I think it's really odd that so many conservative Germans
travel to Turkey for their vacations, get their suntans and then
return home saying the Turks have to go,'' said Abdel Nasser Assal,
a young Egyptian taxi driver.
   He also rejected suggestions that foreigners are stealing jobs
from Germans:
   ``The foreigners who come here have to take jobs the Germans
don't want,'' said Assal. ``It's rare that you find Germans lining
up for work as maids, dishwashers and domestic servants. Those jobs
are left to the foreigners.''

<HEAD>Book: Soviets Use Western Money to Avoid Dealing with Problems at
Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is trying to finance its
reforms with loans from the West while postponing tough decisions
needed at home to curb its budget deficit, says the author of a new
book on the Soviet economy.
   Author Judy Shelton has joined a chorus of skeptics, including
many on Capitol Hill, who worry that Western banks and governments
are extending credits to the Kremlin without reviewing the strategic
implications.
   Shelton's new book, ``The Coming Soviet Crash: Gorbachev's
Desperate Pursuit of Credit in Western Financial Markets,'' includes
a detailed analysis of published Soviet budget data.
   She concluded that Kremlin accountants have been fudging the
country's economic figures for years, steadily reporting budget
surpluses when in fact there were growing deficits. The Soviets
finally admitted to a budget deficit last October.
   The foremost spokesman in Congress on the issue, Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., has cautioned that giving the Kremlin easy credits
could undercut U.S. interests and harm rather than help the reforms
of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Nevertheless, said Shelton, under Gorbachev the Soviets have
turned increasingly to the West for financing.
   As part of the reforms, the Soviets are publishing many
previously secret economic statistics, but Shelton and others
question the data.
   One respected Soviet economist, for example, has said the deficit
is three times higher than the Kremlin has acknowledged.
   Last August, in a prospectus for its first foreign bond issue,
the Soviet government said it had a budget surplus, putting the
figure at 3 billion rubles, or $1.8 billion.
   ``It was revealed three months later that the Soviets had been
running a deficit for years,'' Shelton said. The revelation, she
said, did not prompt a protest from the Swiss bank that sponsored
the loan or from those who bought the issue.
   The continued cloudiness of Soviet financial figures does not
augur well for the West as the Soviets seek to join such Western
financial institutions as the International Monetary Fund, World
Bank and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, which require
``transparent'' reporting in which no numbers are hidden, Shelton
said.
   ``Gorbachev's onslaught of financial maneuvers seems to have left
the United States dazed,'' sh wrote.
   Although the Soviet Union has increased its international
borrowing, the credits do not come close to covering the deficit,
meaning that the Kremlin has simply printed more money to cover the
gap.
   Prices remain under government control, however, disguising or at
least postponing an inflationary spiral.
   And, Shelton said in a Capitol Hill presentation this week,
Gorbachev has not taken one of the major promised steps of his
``perestroika'' campaign to restructure the Soviet economy, a price
reform that would eliminate subsidies on many commodities.
   For the West, the greatest concern is that the Soviets are
borrowing money abroad while postponing tough political decisions at
home.
   ``The correlation between Gorbachev's reign in the Kremlin and
the escalation of Soviet borrowing activities in Western financial
markets is striking,'' wrote Shelton, a researcher at the Hoover
Institution of Stanford University.
   ``Within two years after Gorbachev took power in March 1985,
Soviet debt to the West shot up from about $25 billion to over $37
billion, an increase of 50 percent,'' she wrote.
   Bradley, in a New York Times column on Jan. 6, cautioned that
``the notion that Western governments can help Mr. Gorbachev through
cheap credit is ... flawed.''
   ``Reform means making tough choices _ butter not weapons,
efficiency not useless output, consumption not forced saving. The
real reformers know this. They also know it means higher prices,
less job security and harder work today in exchange for the promise
of a better life tomorrow,'' Bradley said.
   Continuing shortages of basic goods and revelations about the
Soviet budget deficit have tempered optimism about that better life.
   Soviet Finance Minister Boris I. Gostev last October estimated
the budget deficit at 35 billion rubles, about $58 billion at
current exchange rates.
   Another well-known Soviet economist, Leonid Abalkin, last week
said that the actual deficit was nearly three times Gostev's
estimate, about $165 billion, or 11 percent of the gross national
product. By comparison, the U.S. government deficit runs at about 4
percent of GNP.
   Other Soviet officials have been more optimistic. Mikhail
Korolev, chairman of the State Committee for Statistics, wrote in
Pravda on Monday that the GNP grew 5 percent last year and was 13.3
percent higher than in 1985.
   The government announced this month that Soviet GNP in 1988
totaled 866 billion rubles, or $1.4 trillion. That was less than
half of the 1985 U.S. GNP of $3.8 trillion.

<HEAD>Feld Ballet Opens With Minimalist Premier</HEAD>

   An American ballet premier, scheduled for the
third night of the Feld Ballet's Jan. 31 to March 12 season, was
pushed up to opening night because of an injury to a dancer.
   So the Joyce Theater audience on Tuesday saw ``Petipa
Notwithstanding,'' choreographed by Eliot Feld to composer Terry
Riley's 1964 ``In C.''
   The minimalist music set the dancers to relentless motion and had
a physical effect on this viewer, too. The throat closed and nails
were chewed. Stages of viewing went from admiration for the dancers'
skill and stamina to a wish for it to end.
   The dancers, in white leotards with black lines and dots, didn't
look like people. To a steady 4-4 beat, they began moving across the
stage, heads dangling forward like rag dolls. The music changed to
clang-clang, first heard over bells then over a drone, and the
dancers reached up and out, to draw air toward themselves, like
robots on a fantasy assembly line.
   The choreography followed the music. When the beat was fast, the
dancers were frantic. But even when the men were jumping up in
unison and scrabbling under their armpits, there was something
static about the whole thing.
   Marius Petipa, choreographer of ``The Sleeping Beauty,''
mentioned in the title, is considered the originator of classical
ballet.
   Arts need to move forward and modern music must surely inspire
choreographers in new directions. This viewer, who found ``Petipa
Notwithstanding'' neither attractive nor exciting, isn't
appreciating this new direction yet.
   Thomas Lemanski, one of six dancers scheduled for ``Intermezzo
No. 1,'' sustained a lower back injury, causing that dance to be
replaced.
   The evening began with Feld's 1970 ``The Consort.'' It begins in
a courtly way and moves into earthier peasant fare. The women tuck
up their skirts. The men change fitted jackets for homespun and toss
the women in the air and down in a dance that becomes quite sexy
just before the curtain falls. It ended with Feld's 1986 ``Skara
Brae'' set to traditional Scottish, Irish and Breton airs.
   Following its season at the Joyce Theater, the Feld Ballet
company will perform in Providence, R.I.; Storrs, Conn.; Hempstead,
N.Y.; Lyndon, Vt.; Durham, N.H; Orono, Maine; Easton, Pa., and San
Diego.
   Next summer's performance sites include Athens, Greece.

   A bipartisan federal commission that must come
up with ways to cut the government's $150-billion-a-year deficits is
finding agreement out of its grasp even with the deadline for
producing a final report just four weeks away.
   Members of the National Economic Commission, which met Tuesday,
indicated that Republicans were differing over a draft proposal some
of their members were circulating, and that Democrats might end up
filing their own report.
   ``I think it's going to be very hard for us to agree on anything,
without going to jail,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., a
commission member and ranking GOP lawmaker on the House Budget
Committee.
   Frenzel was referring to a court ruling issued earlier this month
that ordered the 14-member commission to hold its sessions in
public. Many panel members have complained that without closed-door
meetings, it has become hard to discuss politically touchy subjects
such as new taxes or spending cuts.
   Former Rep. Thomas Ashley, D-Ohio, appointed to the commission by
President Bush, said Republican staff aides had composed a plan that
embraced Bush's flexible freeze _ limiting spending increases to the
rate of inflation while requiring no new taxes. He would not discuss
the specific program changes advanced in the plan.
   Ashley said he liked the idea. And Drew Lewis, the Republican
co-chairman of the panel, predicted that ultimately, Ashley and the
panel's seven Republicans would ``support the flexible freeze as
drawn up by the president.''
   Others said no such majority consensus was in sight. Panel member
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee, told reporters, ``The implication that Republicans
are unanimously behind something I don't think is true.'' And Robert
Strauss, the Democratic lawyer who co-chairs the commission with
Lewis, said there are ``substantial differences'' among Republicans.
   Lewis also said a minority on the panel might put out a
dissenting report.
   ``I would think there's a good chance that might be the case,''
Strauss said after Tuesday's meeting.
   The views expressed Tuesday made it seem ever less likely that
the panel, created in late 1987 to find a bipartisan, long-range
solution to the government's colossal red ink problem, would
accomplish its goal.
   Tuesday's hour-long session focused on the nation's savings and
loan crisis, and on the multi-billion dollar surpluses built up each
year for future Social Security benefits. Critics say the Social
Security surpluses are making the deficit appear smaller than it
really is.
   Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told the
commission to have its report ready by March 1, rather than six
months later as the law establishing the panel would have allowed.
   Bush advanced his flexible freeze plan during the presidential
election campaign. Under the proposal, overall federal spending
increases would be held to the rate of inflation, with increases in
some programs and reductions in others. With the booming economy
Bush predicts, government revenues would grow at an even faster rate
and the budget would be balanced in a few years without tax
increases, he has said.
   Critics have argued that Bush's expectations for the economy are
too optimistic, and chided him for not mentioning specifically which
programs would face cuts.

   It was a good year for the company that
makes paper for U.S. currency, and that means more folding money for
its workers.
   Crane &amp; Co. officials said Tuesday it would contribute a record
$4.5 million to a profit-sharing plan for 1,100 employees at three
plants in western Massachusetts. The payments amount to between 16
percent and 20 percent of the annual salaries of workers, who make
$6 to $12 an hour, officials said.
   Last year, the company distributed $3.2 million to employees.
   Company officials declined to reveal how much of their total
sales of $119.8 million involved paper used in currency, and aside
from the United States, they would not identify the countries that
use their paper.
   Sales were up for all products made by Crane, such as stationery
and specialty papers for drafting, said personnel director James D.
Manning.
   Manning did say Crane won a new three-year contract to produce
paper for U.S. bills in early 1988. The company first began making
the paper for this country's legal tender in 1879.

   If the latest exhibit at the Steinhart
Aquarium looks like a fish out of water, that's exactly what it is _
a frozen shark.
   The great white shark _ 1,500 pounds and 13{ feet long _ was
caught off the Golden Gate bridge last fall by fisherman Michael
McHenry.
   ``He must have used a huge hook,'' aquarium director John
McCosker said Tuesday. ``It's in there somewhere.''
   McCosker said great white sharks have rarely been kept alive in
captivity for more than a few hours because they have to swim to
breathe.
   But he's confident that someday the aquarium's tanks will contain
a live shark. Until then, the Steinhart's new exhibit is a good _
and safe _ way to get a close look at one.

   Clyde, an 80-year-old Maine lobster, is a long
way from his stomping grounds but he should feel right at home in
this landlocked state. After all, he's been named an honorary
citizen of Nebraska.
   But the 17-pound crustacean will be moving on to saltier waters,
or worse, fall victim to the lobster pot if his new owner cannot
raise $6,000 to buy an aquarium to keep him at Omaha's Henry Doorly
Zoo.
   ``I don't want him being sold. I don't want him being eaten,''
said Louise Douglas, who won Clyde through a grocery store drawing.
``If he made it more than 80 years, I don't want him killed.''
   Hinky Dinky store manager Tim Myers said patrons ooooed and
ahhhed at the mighty lobster when it was lowered into the tank
before the drawing.
   Myers agreed to donate the lobster to the zoo and instead give
her 10 smaller lobster tails, but Mrs. Douglas said the zoo will
only accept Clyde on a permanent basis if a chilled saltwater tank
is purchased to house him.
   Otherwise he'll be sent to the New York Aquarium, said Randy
Wisthoff, associate director of the zoo. He said the lobsters on
display at the zoo are Caribbean creatures and live in warmer waters
than Maine lobsters.
   Meanwhile, Clyde is being stored at the zoo in a big cooler.

<HEAD>US Expects Rebels to Lay Siege to Kabul After Soviets Withdraw</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels are likely to lay siege to Kabul
after the last Soviet troops quit Afghanistan and could bring the
pro-Moscow government down within weeks, a State Department official
says.
   The ``choke 'em'' tactics are designed to force the city's
defenders to surrender or to defect once their Soviet military
support is gone, the official said Tuesday.
   In the past few weeks, the Soviets have bombed rebel positions
throughout the country, partly in an attempt to keep the Mujahedeen
dispersed and to protect a continuing convoy of food and fuel
supplies to Kabul.
   ``When the last Soviet soldier steps across the border they know
in their heart of hearts it's going to unravel,'' said the official,
who spoke only on condition he would not be identified.
   Kabul, already burdened by more than 1 million refugees from the
provinces, has only enough fuel and food to last for a few days, the
official said.
   The rebels, who will continue to receive U.S. arms through
Pakistan, plan to keep ``tightening the noose'' around Kabul and
other urban centers, using a ``siege magnified'' strategy, the
official said..
   The aim is to try to persuade the city's defenders to surrender
or to defect, but many of them are ``of the hard-core type,''
including members of the Afghan secret police, and will stay and
fight because there is little chance of amnesty, the official said.
   ``So it will be difficult,'' he said. ``The crystal ball is
murky. At one time we were talking of them lasting 6 to 12 months,
and then 3 to 6 months. Estimates vary. But it's going to be sooner
rather than later.
   ``If that strangle effect works, and I see no reason why it
should not, the government could unravel very quickly, in a matter
of weeks, not months.''
   The Soviet troops are departing under a Feb. 15 deadline set in
the Geneva accords of last April. The State Department on Monday
accused the Soviets of engaging in a ``scorched earth policy'' of
bombing rebel positions as the Red Army exits.
   The official said the Soviets claim to be retaliating for a rebel
blockade of food and fuel convoys, but were bombing positions as far
away as 30 miles to the east of the main supply route.
   ``So far as we can tell, the resistance has been fairly
restrained about interfering with supplies,'' he said. ``There has
been some interdiction, but not to the extent that the Soviets
suggest.''
   However, the official said, ``the interference is going to grow
if they don't quit this stupidity.''
   He said one aim of the bombing, missile and artillery attacks is
to punish Ahmed Shah Massoud, a rebel leader in the Panjsher Valley
east of Kabul, who has refused to promise not to interdict food and
fuel shipments to the capital.
   Most of the Mujahedeen leaders agreed last November under U.S.
pressure to permit the Soviets to depart without interference.
   ``By taking this bombing action, the Soviets run the risk of the
resistance not letting them withdraw more or less in peace,'' the
official said.
   With tensions rising, the U.S. embassy in Kabul closed on Monday
and the remaining diplomats and security guards were flown out of
the country.
   One reason, he said, was to prevent Afghan officials from seeking
asylum there as political refugees. On the other hand, the State
Department and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service are
consider an application from former Deputy Foreign Minister Abdul
Ghaffar Lakanwal, who defected last November on a trip to New York.
   Last week, the official said, the State Department sent a formal
note to U.S. embassies in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia
instructing them to deny visas to anyone attached to the pro-Moscow
government of President Najibullah.

   An Argentine supply ship that ran
aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds,
the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could
leak and damage the environment.
   The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from
the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic
could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel
aboard the ship were to spill.
   No injuries were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the
crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south
of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Salvage efforts had been
hampered by 50 mph winds.
   The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the
government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique. Telam
did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when
it went down.
   The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately
known.
   The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline
and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science
Foundation said in a statement released in Washington.
   The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer
Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the
continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and
some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing
ashore near Palmer station.
   The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation
statement said.
   There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
   Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank
that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife,
had stopped.
   ``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement
said. It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive
Thursday or Friday.
   Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
   Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82
passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and
taken to Palmer Station.
   The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to
the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the
South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the
station, said Renerie.
   Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement
said.

<HEAD>Baker to Visit NATO Ministers This Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
planning a fast-paced swing to possibly more than a dozen NATO
capitals this month in an attempt to strengthen contacts in the
beleaguered alliance.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman described the tour on
Tuesday as as ``a very complicated arrangement'' that could take the
new secretary to 14 cities in five days.
   It would be Baker's debut tour abroad as President Bush's chief
adviser on foreign affairs.
   The visit comes as tensions are rising within the alliance on
developing a response to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
disarmament overtures and the military cutbacks announced by his
Warsaw Pact allies.
   Another major issue is the dispute over the U.S. contribution to
the alliance and pressure for Europeans members to pick up more of
their own defense costs.
   Recent surveys have shown Gorbachev's so-called ``charm
offensive'' to be highly effective in Western Europe, with fewer
citizens there viewing the 40-year-old alliance as necessary in
light of the Soviet leader's public relations offensive.
   Redman said Baker intends to meet with ``as many of his NATO
colleagues as possible'' and wants to do so in each of the foreign
minister's home capitals because the new secretary attaches a very
high priority to the sessions.
   Redman noted that Baker is scheduled to accompany President Bush
to Canada for a day-long meeting on Feb. 10, as well as to Japan for
the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor Hirohito and the one-day visits that
weekend to China and Korea.
   Baker intends to sandwich the European tour between the Canada
and Far East swing, the spokesman said.
   The alliance is composed of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
West Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United
States.

   She had come thousands of miles and
her journey was nearly over. One last barrier separated the young
Asian woman from her husband in the United States.
   But the Niagara River was too swift and too cold _ too great an
obstacle for a small woman in a flimsy rubber raft _ and she died in
its icy waters on Jan. 5. As many as four others may have died with
her.
   The tragedy below Niagara Falls has provided shocking testimony
to what federal immigration officials have long known: that the
swift 40-mile-long river between Canada and the United States has
become a northern crossing point for growing numbers of illegal
aliens.
   Little is known about the young drowning victim, whose body was
found in the river near the town of Lewiston. Investigators have
determined that she was in her 30s, carried two suitcases and a
passport that did not belong to her, and had come from a small town
in Malaysia.
   Like many others, authorities said, she apparently entrusted her
fate to a smuggling ring that brought her to Toronto, and then was
to bring her to her husband in New York City.
   Benedict Ferro, regional director of the federal Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said his agents have identified half a dozen
organized rings involved in smuggling people across the border. One
ring is thought to have brought in more than 250 Chinese last year.
   Police in Lewiston caught five Chinese immigrants last summer who
apparently had crossed the border in a rubber raft.
   ``When you have a group of wet Chinese walking around the streets
of Lewiston, you're going to attract some attention,'' said Dennis
Peruzzini, head of an INS anti-smuggling unit.
   Peruzzini said the aliens were natives of Fukien Province in
China who had made their way from Hong Kong to Vancouver, British
Columbia; Toronto and then Niagara Falls with the aid of a New
York-based smuggling ring.
   Their destination was New York City's Chinatown, where they would
have tried to find work as laborers, he said.
   Ferro said the leaders of the smuggling rings, called arrangers,
are usually based in New York City and sometimes smuggle drugs or
other contraband. The arrangers have an elaborate system of contacts
in cities in several countries.
   ``You just don't tell a person in Hong Kong to buy a plane ticket
and leave it at that,'' Ferro said.
   The arranger will provide false passports, escorts, safe houses
in Toronto, the means of getting across the border. The methods
vary: Aliens sometimes are squeezed into the trunks of cars or false
compartments in tractor-trailers, inched across the towering
superstructures of bridges or put in flimsy boats.
   Fees of more than $2,000 per alien make it a lucrative business,
Ferro said.
   Ferro described aliens transported illegally across the border as
victims of the smugglers. ``They don't realize the risks involved.
They are simply being preyed upon because of their desire to improve
their economic situation,'' he said.
   Unlike many illegal Mexican immigrants who cross the Rio Grande
with the intention of returning home, those crossing the turbulent
Niagara channel want to stay in the United States permanently,
officials said.
   ``But for the fact they can't qualify for an immigration visa,
these people pretty much fit the mold of legal immigrants in years
past,'' Ferro said.
   ``For the most part they are honest, hard-working people whose
only desire is to better themselves,'' he said. ``If given the
opportunity, they'd probably make great Americans.''
   The Niagara County Sheriff's Department is continuing a search of
the river for the bodies of any other passengers in the raft that
held the young Malaysian woman.
   Authorities don't hold out much hope for finding any bodies until
spring, when the ice covering the shoreline melts.
   Nor do officials expect to hear from the young woman's husband,
who risks deportation if he steps forward to retrieve his wife's
body. Authorities are trying to locate her family in Malaysia so the
body can be returned home.

<HEAD>Shuttle Managers Debating Whether To Replace Discovery's Turbopumps</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Meeting starts after 3 p.m. EST</HEAD>

   NASA says it probably will have to
replace at least two suspect turbopumps whose failure could touch
off a fatal explosion aboard Discovery, and the repairs could delay
the shuttle's liftoff indefinitely.
   Shuttle managers scheduled a late afternoon meeting today to
discuss the three turbopumps, which became questionable when NASA
discovered tiny cracks in one of Atlantis' pumps following that
shuttle's December flight.
   The space agency had been aiming for a Feb. 23 liftoff, but a
series of technical delays not related to the pumps has erased that
date. The agency said it doesn't have a new date.
   The technical problems have postponed Discovery's rollout to the
launch pad, originally set for Jan. 26, a total of eight days, with
the move now set for Friday.
   Officials said engineers are likely to replace at least two of
Discovery's three turbopumps, delaying the launch for weeks or
months. If new pumps have to be installed, NASA must decide whether
it can roll Discovery to the pad and do the work there along with
other operations.
   Post-flight inspection of Atlantis' engines disclosed two tiny
cracks in a bearing assembly in one of three high-pressure liquid
oxygen turbopumps.
   Engineers believe they were caused by stress corrosion resulting
from moisture trapped inside the bearing during the manufacturing
process, but they are uncertain how the moisture penetrated the
metal.
   Officials became concerned when they found that two of
Discovery's turbopumps underwent the same manufacturing process as
the cracked one.
   The turbopump, which transforms the shuttle's liquid oxygen
propellant into gas, operates at extremely high temperatures and
speeds, and its failure could set off an explosion that could
destroy the spaceship. The cracks on Atlantis were too small to
cause trouble, but if such cracks widened and split the bearing
assembly, it could be dangerous, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials said.
   In the past, turbopumps have been replaced while a shuttle is
horizontal in a processing hangar. But Discovery is vertical,
attached to its solid fuel booster rockets and external fuel tank.
   Technicians have been rehearsing procedures for the more
difficult vertical replacement. Officials believe replacing two
turbopumps would take at least two weeks, and that replacement of
all three could delay the launch indefinitely.
   If the launch is delayed too long it would affect the next
Atlantis mission, which is to dispatch the Magellan probe to Venus
after a liftoff scheduled April 28. Discovery would have to be off
the only shuttle launch pad by about March 14 if the April date is
to be maintained.
   NASA has given Atlantis and Magellan priority over the
communications satellite in Discovery's cargo bay, so if the
Discovery launch slips too much, it will be put off until later in
the year.
   That's because there is only a 25-day period starting April 28
when Venus will be in position to receive a probe from Earth. After
that period expires, it will be two more years before the planet
will be aligned properly with Earth.

   Families gathered in a chapel at K.I. Sawyer
Air Force Base after learning of the crash of a KC-135A tanker plane
in Texas, the third air accident in four months involving Sawyer
personnel.
   Of the 19 people who died in Tuesday's crash at Dyess Air Force
Base near Abilene, seven were crew members from Sawyer, 10 were
passengers from Sawyer and two were passengers from Dyess,
authorities said.
   Names were withheld pending notification of families.
   The news hit hard at Sawyer, a small northern Michigan base where
nearly 1,900 families live.
   ``We're a very small, tight-knit community,'' said a base
spokeswoman, Anita Bailey. ``Part of the anxiety is knowing that
these are the people you trained with, went to school with, and work
with.''
   ``It's pretty quiet here. The mood is not good,'' Michelle Clark
said from the Sawyer NCO Club, where she works. ``They've got the
news on in the back, and everyone is sitting back there, just
watching and listening and not talking.''
   ``I think everyone's going to know somebody who was on that
plane,'' said Clark, whose husband is stationed at Sawyer. ``My
husband wanted to go on that mission. Now I'm glad he wasn't
picked.''
   Sawyer personnel have been involved in two other crashes,
including the explosive crash of another KC-135 trying to land at
Paul B. Wurtsmith Air Force Base near Oscoda on Oct. 11.
   Six Wurtsmith crew members died in that crash. Ten Sawyer
personnel aboard were able to leap clear of the burning plane. The
tanker had been ferrying Sawyer personnel to Wurtsmith so they could
inspect the base's nuclear facilities.
   The Air Force's Strategic Air Command has completed its
investigation of that crash, but the report is not ready for public
release, said Major Ken St. John, a SAC spokesman at Barksdale Air
Force Base in Shreveport, La.
   On Dec. 6, a B-52 bomber burst into flames as its crew attempted
touch-and-go landings on Sawyer's main runway. All eight Sawyer
airmen survived.
   The Air Force report on that crash also remains unavailable,
although Sawyer personnel have since been ordered to watch for
overheating fuel pumps in B-52s.

   Joyce Cowfer was in tears when she called Pat
Hennin with the news that she'd miscalcuated the size of her
foundation and realized it would cost nearly $1,000 more to build
her Maryland home.
   Not to worry, said Hennin, co-owner of the Shelter Institute and
Cowfer's former instructor. He consoled her, patiently explained how
to correct her blunder and even drew diagrams and mailed them to her.
   Within a few months she was done: three bedrooms, two baths,
passive solar heat and a Jacuzzi, and all for $55,000 _ about
one-third market value.
   ``They not only give you the information, they give you the
confidence,'' Cowfer said. ``You don't need building experience.''
   For 15 years, Hennin, his wife Patsy and several other
instructors have taught students how to tackle the forbidding task
of building a home _ at less than half the cost of buying the
finished home or hiring someone to build it.
   People who build their own homes are more satisfied, Hennin said.
Less hurried than a contractor, the do-it-yourselfer will examine
every aspect of the building process and make carefully considered
decisions.
   ``Contractors don't shop around'' and generally do not match
solutions to specific problems, he said. The contractor ``simply
does it this way because that's the way they've always done it.''
   More than 14,000 students from around the world, including
novices who barely knew which end of the hammer to hold, have
attended the school located in a 120-year-old brick building in this
coastal town north of Portland. The students range in age from 18 to
70 and have included lumberjacks, doctors, Madison Avenue
executives, carpenters, engineers and architects.
   Students can choose the 15-week, one-day-a-week session for $450
per person or $725 per couple, or opt for compressed sessions of two
or three weeks for slightly more money. Classes are limited to 40
students.
   All students learn how to survey a lot, pour a foundation, design
and build every inch of a house. They also receive instruction in
the concept of heat, the physics of materials, engineering, framing
and financing.
   The information ``was presented in such a way that it was
non-intimidating,'' said Gary Miers, 34, who is spending $50,000 to
build a house valued at $140,000 in Raymond. ``It was presented in a
relaxed fashion.''
   Mistakes aren't ruinous, Hennin said, because ``there isn't
anything in a house that isn't forgiving.''
   That's comforting for students who also quickly learn that the
mistakes they make are much less costly than if a contractor were
building the house.
   ``When a contractor walks into a store, he doesn't ask what the
price is. He just assumes he's getting the wholesale cost,'' but the
price may be lower elsewhere, Hennin said. ``Contractors don't shop
around.''
   For example, a shelter institute student can make insulated glass
windows for about $3 per square foot, whereas a contractor is likely
to pay $10, Hennin said. All the lumber to build a house rarely
would be over $4,000, he added.
   The Hennins, both 45, began their business in 1974. Hennin, who
had just finished law school and had some prior building experience,
was hired to help build a house for a friend. Soon he had other
offers to build, and his wife's interest in home construction
surfaced.
   ``We had a choice of building houses for the rest of our lives or
getting involved in another way _ teaching people,'' Mrs. Hennin
said.
   Housing styles have changed over the last 15 years. After the
simple, box-style homes that marked the days of energy conservation
and the back-to-the-earth movement of the early and mid-1970s,
underground homes became popular. Those now have been replaced by
elaborate designs more reflective of the 1980s: prosperity,
sophistication and self-indulgence, Mrs. Hennin said.
   Jim and Roxie Westbrook of Santa Cruz, Calif., are building a
passive-solar country house on the outskirts of the nearby Henry
Cowell Redwoods State Park, complete with a hot tub and more gadgets
and fixtures than they had in the older homes they owned.
   ``There's nothing cheap in it,'' Mrs. Westbrook said in a
telephone interview. ``When it's a choice between quality and going
for quality, we go for quality.''
   Others prefer a home that is unadorned. Miers and his wife left
Pennsylvania with the romantic notion of building a home that
embraced their 1960s values _ the desire to be independent,
energy-efficient and frugal.
   But despite changing tastes, Mrs. Hennin says most people are
joined by a creative urge and a determination to take control of
their lives.
   ``It's a grabbing of life, rather than letting life roll you
over,'' she said. ``If houses cost so much, it's your responsibility
to figure out a way for them not to cost so much.''

<TEXT>
   Some 30 years ago an explosive drama by a unknown
young black woman defied the odds, the experts and the money men to
open on Broadway.
   Lorraine Hansberry's ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' which starred
Sidney Poitier, went on to win critical raves, and stablished itself
as a cornerstone in Amnerican theater.
   While the story of a black Chicago family's move from the ghetto
into a white neighborhood has been produced thousands of times and
has captivated millions of theater patrons and moviegoers worldwide,
Hansberry's original play has never been seen in its entirety.
   However, a new, uncut production will be broadcast by PBS on Feb.
1. It stars Danny Glover and Esther Rolle. It is the year's first
production in the ``American Playhouse,'' now in its eighth season.
   The new production will include nearly an hour's worth of
restored material, including themes of feminism, African nationalism
and black pride.
   ``Nothing that was cut was cut to censor the play,'' said Robert
Nemiroff, the late playwright's husband and literary executor.
``Pressures were enormous to keep the play as tight and streamlined
as it could possibly be.''
   When the play opened on Broadway in 1959, Walter Kerr, writing
for the New York Herald Tribune, called it ``an impressive first
play, beautifully acted ... relieving and wonderfully caustic
comedy.''
   Directed by Lloyd Richards, it ran for two years and received the
New York Drama Critics Award for best play. It is the story of a
family whose prospects for the future brighten considerably when
misfortune strikes. The death of Walter Younger Sr. leaves his wife
with a $10,000 life-insurance policy and the problem of how to use
it.
   Her son, a chauffeur, wants the money to start a new business,
and her daughter needs money for medical school. Another option, the
wife sees, is buying a new home for the family.
   In one restored scene a neighbor comes in with a newspaper story
about the bombing of a black family's house after they had moved
into a white neighborhood.
   ``This obviously shows the danger the Youngers are facing at the
curtain,'' said Bill Duke, director of the PBS production. ``It
makes clear that for all the joy and affirmation of the family's
inner triumph at the end, it is anything but a traditional happy
ending.'' The scene was cut from the Broadway production to save the
added cost of another actor's salary.
   It took producer Philip Rose nearly two years to find a
co-producer and the money to stage the production. Even with the
money in hand, Broadway theaters were not willing to rent to the new
production until it had proved itself out of town, Nemiroff said.
   But once on stage, the shortened play _ which with an uncany
prescience foresaw the rise of black pride and nationalism in the
United States and Africa _ became a hit with both blacks and whites.
   ``Never before in the entire history of the American theater had
so much of the truth of black people's lives been seen on the
stage,'' the late author James Baldwin wrote.
   While not autobiographical, ``Raisin'' had its origins in
Hansberry's own childhood experiences in Chicago in the 1930s when
her family moved into a white neighborhood. They were evicted from
their home by an Illinois court, but her father, a prosperous
real-estate broker and banker, fought the case to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which outlawed the restrictive covenant.
   After trying her hand at painting and determining she had no
talent, Hansberry moved to New York in 1950 where she concentrated
on her writing, but made little effort at publishing, and earned a
living with a number of odd jobs. Although she wrote extensively,
she completed only two plays during her brief life, ``A Raisin in
the Sun'' and ``The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window.'' She died of
cancer in 1965 at the age of 34.
   Nemiroff, who married Hansberry in 1953, has devoted much of his
life since her death to editing and shaping her works into
publishable form, including the well-received ``To Be Young, Gifted
and Black'' and ``Les Blancs.''
   Hal DeWindt, a teacher, director and associate producer of the
PBS production of ``Raisin,'' said that aside from the restoration
of the original material, this newest version differs from many
previous productions in one important respect.
   ``Every moment is motivated by love, as opposed to it being a
competition between people,'' he said. ``In other productions it was
more a fight to see who was more powerful. The message is much
clearer and much more universal. If it hadn't been done that way, it
would have been just another play about who is more powerful than
who.''
   Rose and David Susskind produced the movie version in 1961.
Directed by Daniel Petrie, it starred Poitier, Ruby Dee, Claudia
McNeil, Diana Sands and Lou Gossett Jr.

   One holy man walked naked among his
disciples, offering sacred ash, blessings and cardamoms as
consecrated host. Not far away, another holy man delivered a sermon
while dressed in a saffron robe.
   ``Why move naked?'' the second said. ``You can reach God
dressed.''
   A third, who pitched his tent nearby, told his group: ``Dress
does not matter. Ways do not matter. ... Be pure, be good and you
will reach heaven. You need no guru.''
   They were Hindu holy men at the Hinduism's biggest congregation,
the ``Kumbh Mela,'' which began here recently in Allahabad.
   The three holy men, each with different views, were examples of
the diversity of a religion believed to have been practiced since
the third millennium B.C.
   They also showed that Hinduism, with 330 million gods and
goddesses, can be confusing even to Hindus.
   The religion claims a following of 730 million people in India
and Nepal and parts of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand in Southeast
Asia; Mauritius, in Africa and Fiji in the South Pacific. For
comparison, the Roman Catholic Church claims a following of 850
million.
   An estimated 500,000 holy men and their followers started camping
at Allahabad on Jan. 14, for a seven-week congregation, or fair,
during which 30 million to 40 million pilgrims were expected to take
dips at the ``Sangam,'' the confluence of the three rivers most
sacred to Hindus _ the Ganges, the Jamuna and the Saraswathi.
   The ``Sangam,'' which takes it's name from a mythical fight
between gods and demons over a pot of nectar, is held every 12 years
when Jupiter enters Taurus and the Sun and the Moon are in Capricorn.
   ``You can't explain Hinduism,'' said M.P. Asthana, who has
attended four earlier fairs. ``It is a way of life, where karmas
(the results of deeds) are most important. Even to an average Hindu,
the faith is so confusing.''
   He added: ``No one can explain how we got to acquire and where
are our 330 million gods and goddesses.''
   Believers worship images and statues of gods and goddesses as
well as live animals, including rats. In Hinduism every god has his
steed, or vehicle, and the rat is the vehicle of Ganesha on whom the
elephant-headed, master-of-ceremony god rides.
   Hinduism postulates that everyone goes through a series of
rebirths, or reincarnations, that eventually lead to Moksha, the
spiritual salvation that frees one from the cycle of rebirths.
   ``With each rebirth you can move closer to or further from
eventual moksha,'' said Asthana, who is the spokesman for the state
government of Uttar Pradesh, in which Allahabad is a major city.
   ``The deciding factor is one's karma. Bad actions result in bad
karma, which leads one to lower incarnation and a step further from
salvation.
   ``But if one's actions have been good he or she will reincarnate
on a higher level and be a step closer to eventual freedom from
rebirth.''
   Coming to Allahabad has special significance for Hindus and tens
of thousands come daily to take holy dips at the Sangam, believing
doing this during the auspicious planetary conjugation will wash
away all the sins of a lifetime and release them from the cycle of
births and rebirths.
   ``It is like appearing directly before God for confessions,''
said Jagannath Dwevedi, the chief adminstrator of the fair.
   ``No one knows how bathing will wash off sins, but the belief is
so great that no logic stands.''
   Before taking the dip, pilgrims offer milk and marigolds to the
rivers in a purification ritual and later throw water with their
hands toward the sky, believing that some drops will reach their
ancestors in the heaven.
   ``Now, this sounds like a total nonsense, but people do it,''
said the 56-year-old Dwevedi. ``It is the age-old belief. It is
above logic.''
   Nagas are the naked recluses of Hinduism and they have their own
logic.
   ``Nakedness ends all dichotomy in human life,'' said one,
refusing to give his name. ``We were born naked and therefore should
remain naked and die naked.''
   Fifty-two different religious groups put up sprawling tent homes
at the fair. Each has its own way to reach God. Most of them
constantly smoke marijuana. They say it helps them meditate and
become closer to God.
   ``This makes Hinduism unique,'' said Asthana. ``There is no
restriction on how you reach your goal _ salvation.''
   Only vegetables appear on the fair's menus because devout Hindus
are vegetarians and eating beef is taboo. Hindus worship the cow.

   For three days, a 73-year-old man sat
stuck in a garbage can up to his armpits on his front porch, dressed
only in a nightshirt while temperatures dipped into the 20s.
   Now that he has been found dead, the community is left with a
troubling question: Why didn't somebody help Robert Hamm?
   ``It was pretty strange,'' said Sgt. R.J. Liepins, who discovered
Hamm on Jan. 25. ``We depend on people telling us if they see
something unusual in the neighborhood so we can check it out. That
didn't happen here.''
   A postman and a 11-year-old newsgirl saw him sitting in the can
on the enclosed porch, several feet from the door, but neither
realized he was in trouble.
   ``He waved to me and I acknowledged just like I'd done hundreds
of times before,'' said John Vane, the postman.
   ``It was a nice day and I just assumed he was sitting there
reading the paper and smoking a cigar, just like always,'' Vane said
Monday. As he walked away, however, he thought something didn't look
right, but he said he didn't go back to take a second look.
   ``In retrospect, I feel bad about what happened, but I really
didn't think anything was wrong,'' he said.
   The newsgirl told her mother, Liepins said, but the woman thought
her daughter was exaggerating or seeing some kind of reflection.
   The girl told her the same thing the next day and finally, after
the girl and her 13-year-old brother insisted, the woman went to
Hamm's home two blocks away, looked at the man through the locked
door on the enclosed porch and called police.
   ``I'm just kicking myself for not taking this more seriously,''
she told the Rochester Times-Union.
   Since talking about the incident, the family has received death
threats and prank phone calls, Liepins said.
   Hamm lived on a corner lot in a middle-class, residential
neighborhood in Rochester.
   At a funeral service Monday at St. Monica's Catholic Church,
Father Robert Gaudio told friends and relatives that they had to
continue to have faith despite Hamm's ``senseless death ... in a
ridiculous situation.''
   His son Martin said the family did not want to talk with the
media, but he characterized reports in the local media about his
father as ``highly inaccurate and absolutely ghoulish.''
   Some neighbors described Hamm as an eccentric and a drinker.
Others said he was lonely and appeared to be depressed. Liepins said
investigators found open whiskey bottles in the two-story,
wood-frame house.
   Authorities have speculated that Hamm suffered a heart attack and
slumped into the can after resting on its edge. Or, they say, he may
have fallen into the can and then suffered the heart attack.
   Dr. Nicholas Forbes, Monroe County medical examiner, said Hamm
died of a heart attack, but it's not possible to determine when it
happened.
   Liepins said the door to the porch was locked and he had to break
a basement window to get into the house. He found some money and
other valuables, so police do not suspect any foul play.
   ``The thing that really gets you,'' Liepins said, ``is imagining
yourself in that position and not being able to get help.''

<HEAD>British Government Offers To Buy AK-47s, Which Become Illegal Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is offering to buy Kalashnikov
assault rifles and other high-powered guns that become illegal today
under a new firearms law.
   Owners have until April 30 to apply for the $265 payment, Home
Secretary Douglas Hurd said Tuesday. The sum is based on the price
such rifles fetched at auction before parliament took up the measure
in September 1987.
   Under the new law, the penalty for possessing a prohibited weapon
is up to five years in jail or a $3,500 fine.
   The Firearms (Amendment) Act was introduced after Michael Ryan
killed 16 people as he strolled through the small town of Hungerford
in August 1987 before taking his own life. It bans the private use
of high-powered self-loading rifles like the Kalashnikov, which Ryan
used in the massacre, and other weapons including short-barreled,
smooth-bore guns.
   Fully automatic weapons are already prohibited in Britain.
   The government payment applies to owners who acquired the newly
banned weapons before September 23, 1987.
   Calls in the United States for greater restrictions on the sale
of semi-automatic weapons have increased since last month's
shootings in a Stockton, Calif., elementary school yard.
   Patrick Purdy killed five children and wounded 30 people with a
Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle before ending his own life, police
say.

<HEAD>Two Men Jailed for Trapping A Fox In Its Lair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRKENHEAD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first successful prosecution of
its kind in Britain, two men were sentenced to a month in jail for
causing a fox to suffocate after trapping it in its lair.
   Some spectators applauded after Barry Pruden, 27, and Stephen
Horton, 27, were sentenced Tuesday by magistrates in this north
central city near Liverpool. Pruden and Horton, both of Liverpool,
were also banned for two years from keeping any animal.
   The Royal Society for the Protection of Animals, which filed the
complaint against the two men, argued that the fox was made captive
when the men blocked two holes to its lair. The two were found
guilty on Jan. 3 of causing unnecessary suffering to a captive fox.
   It was the first time anyone was found convicted of such a crime,
despite years of anti-fox hunting efforts by animal rights activists.
   Animal rights groups have battled for years to disrupt ``blood''
sports such as fox hunting. They have laid false trails for hounds,
bought grounds used for deer hunts. Once, two men desecrated the
grave of England's greatest fox hunter, the Duke of Beaufort.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Press Institute is urging the
Peruvian government to investigate the murder of a journalist and do
more to safeguard other threatened members of the press.
   The respected London-based organization, in a message to
President Alan Garcia Perez on Tuesday, called violence against
journalists a ``gross violation'' of their right to work.
   The institute's director, Peter Galliner, wrote that the
institute is ``extremely concerned'' at the lack of any
investigation into the murder of Hugo Bustios, 34, a local
correspondent for the Lima news magazine Caretas.
   Bustios and another journalist, 27-year-old Eduardo Rojas, were
shot by gunmen in November while traveling by motorcycle on the
outskirts of the Peruvian city of Huanta. Rojas was seriously
wounded.
   ``Furthermore, we deplore the recent increase in violence against
journalists in general,'' the message says.
   ``Whilst we are aware of the current complex situation in Peru,
we would remind you that such attacks are a gross violation of the
right of journalists to gather information and the right of people
everywhere to receive information,'' it says.
   ``We strongly urge an immediate and rigorous enquiry into the
murder of the Caretas' correspondent and that your government acts
at once to ensure that journalists may pursue their work without
interference or fear of their physical safety,'' it says.
   Peruvian officials said they had not determined whether Bustios'
murder was carried out by the Shining Path insurgency, a
Mao-inspired group which has been fighting to overthrow the
government for eight years, or a new anti-rebel death squad called
the Rodigo Franco Command.
   Both groups have threatened journalists in and around Ayacucho,
the birthplace of the Shining Path, 30 miles south of Huanta.

<HEAD>Grieving Family Commits Suicide, Leaves Money To Accident Victims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The family of a boy who died two years
after a bus accident left him comatose committed suicide in grief
and left its assets to ``traffic accident victims who live like
vegetables,'' police said today.
   Kim Hi-yun, 50, director of a Korea Water Resources Corp. field
office, his wife and 22-year-old son were found dead by Kim's
chauffeur and sister-in-law Monday in the family's apartment, police
said.
   ``We have decided to follow our son, Kyu-tak, because our lives
have been miserable since he died,'' police quoted a suicide note
left by the family as saying. ``We expect social charity
organizations to use all our assets for those traffic accident
victims who live like vegetables.''
   Kyu-tak was a high school freshman three years ago when he was
hit by a city bus near school. He never regained consciousness and
died Nov. 17.
   No value could immediately be placed on the family's assets,
which include a two-story building and a plot of land in Seoul,
police said.

<TEXT>
   Tobacco heiress Doris Duke's pet camels won't be
wintering in Hawaii after all. Instead, Princess and Bebe will
remain at Ms. Duke's estate in Hillsborough, N.J., her attorney said.
   ``The main reason to keep them in New Jersey this winter is _
though the permit process was successful _ it came at a time when it
would make it too difficult to transport them,'' Don Robinson said
Monday.
   Ms. Duke, 75, planned to keep the Bactrian camels at her 4.9-acre
ocean-front estate while she winters in Hawaii.
   An application to house the pets in the exclusive residential
area was approved by the state Board of Agriculture, but other
officials were angry that the camels would not be quarantined for
three months as other island-bound pets are. The board treated the
camels as cattle, rather than pets, exempting them from the
quarantine.
   The publicity shy Ms. Duke made headlines recently when she
posted $5 million bail for her friend, former Philippines first lady
Imelda Marcos, who was arraigned in October in New York on
racketeering charges.

<HEAD>Smiling, Waving Soviet Soldiers Depart Kabul, `Glad To Be Leaving'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet soldiers smiled and waved as
their convoy left Kabul for home today on the strategic Salang
Highway, an Afghan government spokesman said. Heavy shelling could
be heard just up the road.
   At dawn, the convoy moved through a checkpoint about two miles
from the capital, en route to the Soviet border 250 miles miles
away, said an interior ministry spokesman who identified himself
only as Hamad.
   The spokesman said the convoy, mostly made up of trucks carrying
up to 50 soldiers each, took 50 minutes to pass through the
checkpoint.
   ``They were happy to be leaving. They were smiling and waving,''
he said.
   Hamad said artillery fire heard about six miles up the road came
from guerrillas hiding in the mountains that surround the highway,
the only land route home for Red Army troops in Kabul.
   Afghan soldiers refused to allow any non-military vehicles up the
road, citing the possibility of heavy shelling. But crowded buses
traveled south down the highway, with people riding on top dressed
in ragged shawls and turbans that flapped in the winter wind.
   Hamad declined to say when the next convoy would move out, but
said convoys have been leaving every other day in recent weeks.
   On Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, commander of the Red Army
forces in Afghanistan, wooould not say how many Soviet troops
remained in the country or when the withdrawal would be completed.
   Gromov also denied U.S. allegations that the Soviets were
conducting a ``scorched earth'' policy as their last units leave
Afghanistan in advance of a Feb. 15 deadline.
   In neighboring Pakistan's capital of Islamabad, Western diplomats
said all Soviet forces were expected to be out of Kabul by Feb. 6,
nine days before the deadline set by a U.N.-mediated withdrawal
agreement.
   Spokesmen in Islamabad for the guerrillas, who began fighting
after a communist coup 11 years ago, said four long-range Soviet
missiles killed 70 people this week in villages near the Salang
Highway.
   According to the Western diplomats, the increase in attacks by
Soviet and government forces appeared aimed at pressuring the
insurgents toward a political settlement. The guerrillas have
refused offers of such a settlement from both the Kremlin and its
client government in Kabul.
   The last 11 staff members of the U.S. Embassy, which was closed
Monday, left Kabul on Tuesday and a Soviet airlift of food and fuel
resumed.
   Six Ilyushin 76 transport planes dropped flares to deflect
missiles as they landed at midday Tuesday. Each was followed by a
camouflaged military helicopter dropping flares.
   Guerrillas supported by the United States and Pakistan control
the hills and mountains around Kabul and often fire heat-seaking
missiles at aircraft near the airport.
   They also have attacked supply convoys bound for Kabul on the
Salang, causing severe food and fuel shortages that made the Soviet
airlift necessary.
   Soviet and Western diplomats estimate the number of Soviet
soldiers still in Afghanistan at 15,000-20,000. Red Army soldiers
arrived in Afghanistan in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000
were in the country when the pullout began May 15.
   Some military advisers will remain in Afghanistan in keeping with
a Soviet-Afghan agreement, Gromov said. The United States contends
such a presence would violate the Geneva agreements of April 14,
under which the withdrawal is being conducted.
   ``I want to underline the Soviet Union will fulfill its
commitments under the Geneva agreements,'' Gromov said, adding, ``We
don't intend to bomb the territory of Afghanistan from Soviet
territory after the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers.''
   Heavy fighting has occurred between Soviet and Afghan troops and
the guerrillas of Ahmed Shah Masoud along the Salang Highway.
   Masoud, one of the best insurgent field commanders, controls the
Panjshir Valley through which the highway runs.
   In Moscow, Col.-Gen. Bronislav Omelichev, first deputy Soviet
chief of staff, said Tuesday: ``Our troops deliver strikes or engage
in combat operations just to secure the safety of the withdrawal of
our troops to the territory of the Soviet Union.''
   Gromov said the Afghan government had negotiated with Masoud to
make the Salang Highway safe, but he rejected the offer and began
attacking Afghan army outposts Jan. 23.
   ``I think he is sorry now,'' the general said.

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old boy has gone on trial in
open court for selling crack cocaine, despite his lawyer's pleas
that the case be closed to the public, as is the case in most Family
Court proceedings.
   Suffolk County Family Court Judge Donald Auperin cited society's
concern over drug abuse in ruling Tuesday that the case should be
tried before the public.
   ``This is a tragic story of a young boy who may have been at the
wrong place at the wrong time,'' the boy's Legal Aid lawyer, Douglas
O'Connor. ``It wasn't his fault that he lives in a place where these
types of things take place. He did not choose the place where he
lives.''
   The boy, whose name the judge asked the press to withhold, lives
with his family in a poor neighborhood in Wyandanch, a suburban Long
Island community about 20 miles east of New York City.
   The 5-foot-tall defendant appeared bored and at times sleepy as
four Suffolk County police officers took the stand to describe the
events that led to his arrest Jan. 15.
   Two officers testified that they saw the boy and his 14-year-old
companion selling crack from a BMX dirt bike that they rode up and
down Straight Path in Wyandanch, an area known for drug-dealing.
   When police moved into arrest them, an officer testified, the
10-year-old threw away a brown paper bag that was found to contain
three plastic bags of crack, worth $20 each. The two boys were found
to be carrying $226. The older boy is being tried seperately.
   During an intermission in the two-hour proceeding, he began to
cry. A court officer asked his mother to comfort him, and she walked
over and patted him on the shoulder, which seemed to calm him.
   When Tuesday's session was over, O'Connor asked if the child
could go home for the night, but the judge refused and ordered him
taken to the Nassau County Children's Shelter, where he has been
held for the past two weeks.
   As the child was handcuffed and led out, he called out in a
choked-up voice, ``Mommy, are you coming back tomorrow?''
   His mother called back, ``Yes, yes.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ordered the release of a man
accused of trying to export nerve gas, despite the government's
contention that the suspect was a threat to national security
because he held highly sensitive classified documents.
   Juhwan Yun was scheduled to be released on $2 million bail this
afternoon after U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin ruled that the
government had failed to demonstrate that Yun was a risk to flee.
Federal prosecutors are appealing the ruling.
   At a hearing Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer had
argued that the Korean-American businessman's ties with foreign
governments and military bases abroad would make him likely to flee
to avoid prosecution.
   Singer also disclosed that Yun, 48, of Short Hills, N.J., held
documents revealing the United States' capability to intercept enemy
communications. She said the documents were found on a desk at Yun's
import-export business.
   ``Yun appears to have had contact with individuals in or
associated with branches of the U.S. military and-or military
installations abroad,'' Ms. Singer said in a letter to the court.
   ``Revelation of the information would not only compromise
specifics of our EW (Electronic Warfare) capabilities but would also
reveal details of our knowledge of enemy threat,'' Navy Capt. M.
Oetinger, vice director of the Pentagon's Joint Electronic Warfare
Center, said in a memorandum to the U.S. Customs Service.
   Yun was arrested Jan. 12 by U.S. Customs Agents when he arrived
for a meeting with an undercover agent he believed was an arms
dealer.
   Military documents found afterward in Yun's office were used by
the government previously to argue that Yun should not be released
on bail. Ms. Singer has argued that Yun apparently had contacts with
several foreign governments, which would prefer he not stand trial
in the case.
   The government previously has said Yun may have had contacts at
U.S. military installations. The documents filed Tuesday reveal for
the first time that those contacts may have been at U.S. bases in
other countries.
   Lt. Col. Arnie Williams, a spokesman for the Pentagon, declined
comment until he had time to review the new government disclosures.
   The new information also alleges that Korean-language documents
marked ``Secret'' show how much is known about an unidentified
enemy's electronic signals and gives details of specialized warfare
systems expected for use in the year 1992 and beyond.
   Although the documents were in Korean, the government's new
filings do not say if they were from the South Korean government or
if the enemy mentioned was North Korea.
   The documents also discussed electronic countermeasures, the
jamming of enemy signals and the deposition, numbers and locations
of enemy forces, according to the court papers.
   Yun is charged along with a British national for allegedly
plotting to buy the nerve gas sarin and other military equipment for
export. Authorities have said the nerve gas's possible destination
was Iran.
   Richard Cimusz, an FBI counterintelligence agent, said in a new
affidavit filed Tuesday that Yun had been investigated previously
for allegedly trying to obtain other military equipment, including
night-vision equipment, fighter planes and tank parts.
   The government has said Yun boasted of high-level military and
civilian contacts with Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of China
and South Korea.
   Cimusz said Yun has had contact with officials of two different
countries that ``are of counterintellgence interest to the FBI'' and
that he had ``official documents from a third country of
counterintelligence interest to the FBI.''

   Sikh extremists with Chinese assault
rifles barged into a farmer's house in the northern state of Punjab
and fatally shot him and five of his relatives, a senior police
official said today.
   The floor in the farmer's house in Ladho village, 21 miles from
this holy city of Sikhs, was covered with blood after the killings
Tuesday, senior police superintendent Sanjeev Gupta said.
   The victims, identified as Bakhish Singh, his wife Kulwant Kaur
and their two sons and two daughters-in-law were converts to the
Sikh faith, Gupta said in Amritsar, about 250 miles north of New
Delhi.
   ``The bodies were piled in a corner of the bullet-riddled room
and utensils smeared in blood lay scattered,'' he said. A
blood-soaked kirpan, the traditional sword carried by all Sikh men,
lay next to Bakhish Singh, Gupta said.
   Police believe seven or eight gunmen fired on the family and
escaped under cover of darkness.
   Sikh extremists, waging a violent war to establish a theocratic
state, are known to have killed fellow Sikhs who are not sympathetic
to their cause.
   A total of 181 people have been killed this year in the
extremist-linked violence in Punjab state, where a majority of
India's 18 million Sikhs live. Sikh extremists want to carve out an
independent homeland in the agriculturally rich Punjab state and
call it `Khalistan' (Land of the Pure).
   The separatists allege Sikhs are discriminated against by the
majority Hindus and the Hindu-dominated government of India.

   The Princess of Wales, visiting the Big Apple for
the first time, will attend a gala performance of the Welsh National
Opera, promote British exports from cashmere to toys and meet with
children suffering from AIDS.
   The princess was to arrive this afternoon for her three-day
whirlwind tour of the city, during which she will meet the city's
social elite as well as its sick and homeless.
   Princess Diana's last visit to the United States was in 1985,
when she and her husband, Prince Charles, went to the White House.
   The princess is traveling alone this time and will stay in an
$1,800-a-night suite at the Plaza Athenee.
   The highlight of the visit will be the American debut Thursday
night of the Welsh National Opera at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
She is patron of the opera company.
   Following the black-tie, $1,000-a-seat benefit performance of
Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' the 850 ticket holders will have dinner with
Diana.
   Diana _ the mother of Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4 _
also plans to take over F.A.O. Schwarz, the posh Fifth Avenue toy
store, to announce an exposition next month of British-made toys,
children's apparel and other goods.
   The princess will then turn her attention to the city's less
fortunate children with a trip Thursday morning to a day-care
program and a homeless shelter.
   On Friday morning, she will go to Harlem Hospital to visit
children suffering from AIDS. She is scheduled to leave that
afternoon.
   Supporters of the Irish Republican Army have planned protests to
mark Diana's visit, including a demonstration at Thursday night's
opera.

<HEAD>Statistician Estimates AIDS Spread From A Solitary Prostitute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDS-infected prostitute who has
unprotected sex with her customers will spread the killer virus to
60 adults and one unborn baby over a five-year period, a study
suggests.
   The study, published in February's issue of the Journal of Sex
Research, was based solely on statistical calculations and didn't
analyze actual cases of prostitutes with AIDS. It said 20 men, 40 of
their female partners and one unborn baby would be infected with the
incurable disease.
   ``The fact that one very active prostitute could be responsible
for about one infected baby seems pretty high when you consider the
number of prostitutes infected with the virus,'' Santa Clara
University statistician Steven Nahmias said Tuesday.
   But the study supports the notion that ``prostitutes are a major
source of spreading AIDS to the heterosexual community,'' Nahmias
said in a telephone interview.
   ``There are public policy implications in terms of getting
prostitutes off the street who are infected with AIDS, but I'm not
advocating quarantining them,'' he said. ``It's not my job to
suggest actions.''
   Because the study is based on certain assumptions, the figures
Nahmias calculated are ``probably high, but how high really can't be
determined,'' said Dr. David Dassey, deputy medical director of the
AIDS Program Office at the Los Angeles County Department of Health
Services.
   ``The issue is not whether we get rid of prostitutes,'' Dassey
said. ``The issue is whether people make healthy choices about who
they have sex with.''
   Nahmias said his study assumed condoms weren't used, so the
estimates would be lower if clients of prostitutes use latex
prophylactics.
   The study, based on mathematical formulas and assumptions Nahmias
called reasonable, predicted that one active, AIDS-infected
prostitute could be expected within a five-year period to infect 20
men, who would infect 40 other female sex partners, who in turn
would produce 0.8 infected children.
   Recent studies have shown the AIDS infection rate among
prostitutes is about 6 percent in Los Angeles, about 9 percent to 21
percent in New York City, and 49 percent in northern New Jersey,
where most of those infected also abused intravenous drugs, a major
way the virus is spread.
   Nahmias' study assumed that only two of the 40 women infected by
prostitutes' clients became pregnant during the five-year period,
which may mean the number of AIDS-infected babies is understated.
   The study also didn't estimate the total number of AIDS cases
resulting from a single prostitute. For example, it excluded men
infected by women who were infected by prostitutes' clients.
   On the other hand, Dassey said the estimates may be high because
it assumed that each prostitute engaged in 2,000 sexual contacts
yearly _ more than five daily _ including with repeat clients, and
that each male client engaged in sex 200 times annually.
   The study assumed a 1-in-500 chance that the AIDS virus would be
spread during a single sexual act. Dassey and Nahmias agreed that
figure is valid based on several studies of male-to-female
transmission. But Dassey said the risk is probably lower for
female-to-male transmission.
   He also said the study assumed all sex acts were vaginal
intercourse and ignored the likelihood that prostitutes more
frequently perform oral sex upon clients, an act less likely to
spread the AIDS virus.
   Nahmias, however, said his figures might be understated because
they ignore increased odds that prostitutes and their clients also
suffer sores from other venereal diseases, which would likely raise
the chance of AIDS infection from a single sex act higher than 1 in
500.

Scientific Study of Sex and is edited by researchers at the
University of California, Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Doctors, Nurses, Unions Oppose Health Service Shake-Up Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT typo in spelling of Thatcher's first
name. Picks up 4th pvs, `Health Secretary ...' ^By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's plan for a major reform of the
free National Health Service _ cutting billions in state costs by
letting big hospitals charge fees and by promoting private insurance
_ is meeting stiff opposition.
   Many doctors, nurses and major unions expressed serious
reservations about the plan announced Tuesday by the Conservative
government. Some condemned it as an attempt to dismantle the system.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the legislative proposals
the ``most far-reaching reform of the National Health Service in its
40-year history.''
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke, the Cabinet member heading the
service, added: ``All our proposals share a common purpose _ to make
the health service a place where patients come first.''
   But the opposition Labor Party accused the government of trying
to wreck the National Health Service.
   Rodney Bickerstaffe, secretary of the National Union of Public
Employees, one of the main health service unions, condemned it as
``a cynical charter to dismember the National Health Service and
transplant Britain's health care in a commercial circus.''
   The 650,000-member union represents hospital cleaners, porters,
kitchen staff and other health service workers.
   The British Medical Association said in a statement that it had
``serious reservations about whether the proposals will produce the
desired improvements in the quality of services.''
   Under the plan, the 320 largest and most sophisticated of the
2,000 National Health Service hospitals can become independent in
1991, taking fee-paying private patients and billing local
authorities for others.
   The 320 self-governing hospitals under the government plan also
will be able to charge patients for extras such as meals, private
telephones or television.
   For the first time too, private health insurance for the elderly,
the biggest burden on the state system, will be tax-deductible.
   The self-governing hospitals under the government plan will be
able to attract quality staff, from consultants to cleaners, by
setting their own pay scales, the government said.
   Other planned changes include fining general practitioners who
prescribe too many medicines.
   Under the plan, family doctors with big practices will get
separate state budgets to buy drugs and hospital treatment from
private, state or self-governing hospitals for elective surgery.
They will be allowed to keep half of any savings on the drugs budget.
   Consultants and general practitioners will have their costs
independently audited and, like hospitals, will be encouraged to
compete for patients.
   The plan, to be drafted as a government bill, needs parliamentary
approval to become law. But the government's overwhelming
parliamentary majority ensures its passage and the entire package of
proposed changes is expected to be in force within three years.
   The National Health Service came into operation on July 5, 1948,
part of a wave of social legislation by Clement Attlee's Labor Party
government designed to give Britons a better post-war life.
   The new plan is seen by some as an attempt to borrow from the
American health system, with its emphasis on private care, without
increasing spending.
   The National Health Service operates alongside a smaller system
of private hospitals and other medical care. The private system is
not affected by the government plans unveiled Tuesday.
   Government officials said the plan will streamline the health
bureaucracy, give the public wider choice but deny no one access to
free treatment.
   Trevor Clay, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing
representing health service nurses, said: ``I do not see much
consumer choice in these proposals. ... As patients, we all have a
price tag on our heads now.
   ``Some of this looks like a return to the elite voluntary
hospitals and local authority infirmaries when I first started
nursing'' before World War II.
   The National Health Service has 1 million staff. Used by 90
percent of the population, it is generally popular and Mrs. Thatcher
has held back from exposing it to her strategy of rolling back
socialism. Instead, spending has increased by nearly one-third since
1979 to $38.7 billion a year.

<HEAD>Lawyer Will Appeal Manslaughter Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joel Steinberg will appeal his manslaughter
conviction by arguing that the judge in the child-killing case was
prejudiced from the start, an attorney said.
   Attorney Ira London said Tuesday he remembered that state Judge
Harold Rothwax predicted at a pretrial bail hearing that Steinberg
was ``probably guilty, probably would be found guilty and probably
would be sentenced to life in prison.''
   London said Rothwax used prejudicial rulings and inflammatory
evidence to coax the jury toward a conviction on a more serious
charge so he would not seem wrong.
   ``After all,'' London said, ``if there were a second-degree
manslaughter conviction here, it certainly would have made his
earlier opinion look foolish.''
   Steinberg, 47, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter Monday
in the death of Lisa Steinberg, the 6-year-old girl he illegally
adopted at birth.
   London said Rothwax prejudiced the case by repeatedly letting the
jury view a videotape of a seriously beaten Hedda Nussbaum, the
defendant's former live-in companion, and by his instructions to the
jury regarding the definition of intent.
   ``There is no question in my mind from the length of the
deliberations and from talking to the jurors ... that Joel got a
fair shake from the jurors,'' London said at his Brooklyn office.
But ``it is a serious issue whether Joel got a fair trial because of
the judge's rulings.''
   London said neither he nor his co-counsel at the trial, Adrian
DiLuzio, had spoken to Steinberg since the verdict.
   ``We're going to have to make a provision for him to be kept in
protective custody in upstate New York assuming he gets a serious
jail sentence, and I would anticipate that happening,'' London said.
   But he said Steinberg is not afraid. ``Joel is not a fearing
person,'' London said. ``He's been able to handle himself in a safe
way at Rikers Island (jail). Rikers Island has not been without
incident, but he's done OK there.''
   Also Tuesday, Ms. Nussbaum's attorneys, Barry Scheck and Betty
Levinson, said their client was ``relieved and gratified'' that
Steinberg had been convicted and ``will now try to make herself into
a useful person.''
   Scheck said Ms. Nussbaum will remain at the Four Winds
psychiatric facility in Katonah, N.Y., for a while.
   Ms. Levinson, Ms. Nussbaum's civil attorney, noted that she had
filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Steinberg ``basically
for the destruction of her life.''
   ``She needs the wherewithal to put her life together again,'' Ms.
Levinson said, ``and that includes financial ability.''

<HEAD>More Than 400 Prisoners Pardoned on Revolution Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has pardoned 423 prisoners and
commuted the prison terms of another 50 under an amnesty issued for
the 10th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, the Iranian
government said today.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said those pardoned
have been released in the past two days.
   It said amnesty for other prisoners is expected to be issued
during the 10-day celebrations that began today, the anniversary of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's return to Iran from exile in 1979.
   The brief report, monitored in Nicosia, did not give any other
details.
   IRNA reported last week that Khomeini would pardon prisoners on
the national holiday that marks the overthrow of the Iranian
monarchy by the Islamic Revolution.
   It said Iran would also suspend executions of prisoners sentenced
to death during the 10 days.
   At least 132 alleged drug traffickers have been executed this
month in Iran. Another five men, all of them Afghan nationals, were
executed Tuesday after they were convicted of armed robberies and
rape.
   More than 1,500 people have been arrested in a nationwide
anti-narcotics campaign. A law passed in early December mandates the
death penalty for anyone found in the possession of even small
qunatities of drugs.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, on
Monday appealed to the world to put pressure on the Khomeini regime
to halt what it called a campaign of political executions.
   Amnesty said about 1,000 political prisoners have been executed
in the past six months.

   The arctic air that gave Alaska a record cold wave headed south
across the Plains and Mississippi Valley today, dropping
temperatures to 20 below zero, as blizzards buffeted the northern
Plains.
   In contrast, sections of the country ahead of the cold front that
heralded the cold-air mass enjoyed continued warm weather.
   By early today, the cold air had reached as far south as Kansas
and Missouri. Temperatures were 10 to 20 degrees below zero in North
Dakota, Minnesota, Montana and Wyoming, and winds produced wind
chills of 50 to 60 below in the Dakotas and Montana.
   The drop in temperatures was dramatic. Valentine, Neb., had a
record high of 70 degrees Tuesday before the mercury plunged to zero
in 10 hours. The temperature dropped 33 degrees in just one hour
after the front passed through town.
   In addition to the cold, blizzards hit northwest Minnesota,
southeast North Dakota and southern Montana. Cut Bank, Mont., had 5
inches of snow and Helena, Mont., received 4. Blowing, drifting snow
dropped visibilities to almost zero in parts of Montana and
Minnesota.
   Snow also fell in Washington state. Snohomish had 5 inches of
snow, Spokane got 4 to 5, Everett had 4 and over a foot of snow was
considered possible in the Cascade Mountains. In Bellingham, winds
gusted to 60 mph.
   Unseasonably warm weather continued south of the cold air, with
temperatures in the 50s and 60s from the southern Plains to the Ohio
Valley and the middle and southern Atlantic Coast. It was 55 degrees
in Buffalo, N.Y., early today, topping the record high for the date
set in 1988 by 1 degree. Grand Rapids, Mich., reported a
record-tying 51 degrees. On Tuesday, high-temperature records were
broken or tied in 64 cities.
   Today's forecast called for snow from much of the Pacific
Northwest to the northern and central Rockies, the Dakotas and
Nebraska; snow showers in northern New England and parts of the
upper Great Lakes; rain along the central Pacific Coast; and strong,
gusty winds over the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were expected to be almost 25 below zero in
north central Montana, nearly 10 below zero in North Dakota and near
zero in northwest Minnesota; in the single digits and teens in upper
Michigan, much of Wisconsin, the upper Misssissippi Valley, the
northern Plains and the northern Rockies; the 20s and 30s in
northern New England, lower Michigan, the rest of Iowa, the central
Rockies and the northern Pacific Coast; the 40s and 50s from the
central Pacific Coast to the southern Rockies, Missouri, Kansas,
Ohio, the northern Appalachians, northern New Jersey and central New
England; the 80s in central and southern Florida and much of Texas
and Louisiana; and in the 60s and 70s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 21
degrees below zero at Havre, Mont., to 70 degrees at Key West Naval
Air Station, Fla.

   The U.S. dollar was mostly higher in light, early
European trading today, and its strength pushed down gold prices,
currency and bullion dealers said.
   European currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise to
comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Tuesday that current exchange rates were tolerable.
   They predicted little movement until finance ministers and
central bankers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations meet in
Washington later this week.
   ``At the moment, the dollar is trading in a very narrow range,''
said a dealer at a large German bank in Frankfurt. ``I see it moving
higher very, very slowly.''
   Dealers in Milan, Italy, said the market also appeared confident
that President Bush would act to reduce the U.S. deficit.
   ``This is honeymoon time for Bush and that's certainly helping
the dollar,'' said one trader at a major European commercial bank in
Milan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar surged 1.27 yen to a closing 130.40. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 130.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8719 West German marks, up from 1.8710
   _1.5952 Swiss francs, down from 1.5985
   _6.3720 French francs, up from 6.3580
   _2.1154 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1100
   _1,370.75 Italian lire, up from 1,365.00
   _1.1840 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, one British pound cost 1.7475 dollars, cheaper for
buyers than 1.7535 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $390.20 a troy ounce,
down from $394.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $392.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $391.75, down from $394.20 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.25 to close at a bid $392.30.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.81 a troy ounce,
down from Tuesday's $5.85.

   Slowly, gingerly, benumbed Alaskans
emerged from their shuttered homes and shops as a mass of bitterly
cold air that broke temperature records blew southward into Canada
and the lower 48 states today.
   With the icy weather went high winds that raked much of the state
earlier in the week, resulting in at least one death. On Tuesday,
the body of a man whose skiff was swamped by high seas and strong
winds off the coast of southeast Alaska was found on a beach.
   Anchorage, helped by sunny skies, recorded a toasty high of minus
2 degrees, substantially above the double-digit, sub-zero lows that
plagued Alaska's largest city during the two-week cold snap.
   Joe Inderbitzen, the owner of Alaska Cab, said his drivers still
were scrambling to keep up with a nonstop demand for rides, but the
destinations changed a bit with the warmer weather Tuesday night.
   ``People are starting to go out a little more,'' Inderbitzen
said. ``They're going to the bars and the restaurants a little more.
I noticed it tonight.''
   Business also was getting back to normal in Valdez, North
America's northernmost ice-free harbor, where winds gusting to 93
mph had shut down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline terminal and caused
officials to reduce the flow of oil from the North Slope by 65
percent.
   Tankers, banned earlier from the harbor because the wind made the
Valdez Narrows dangerous, were allowed to pick up loads at the
terminal Tuesday and flow in the pipeline was expected to increase
to normal levels of more than 2 million barrels daily, said Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co. spokesman Tom Brennan. The National Weather
Service said temperatures in much of Alaska would moderate toward
the end of the week, but remain well below normal for this time of
year.
   The arctic air lingered over Alaska for more than a week, locked
in place by a warm-air jet stream that blew more northerly than
usual, the weather service said. When the jet stream shifted south,
the icy mass broke free, sending balmy temperatures plunging in
Canada, the northern Plains and the Midwest.
   Eagle Village Store owner Frank Robbins said residents in that
tiny Yukon River village 360 miles northeast of Anchorage were
taking the cold in stride.
   ``Most of the people are accustomed to this,'' he said. ``Our
average temperature for this time of year is 25 or 30 below. It's
not that bad. We haven't had any cold weather like this in six
years. But it used to be pretty normal.''
   Major hospitals in the state reported only minor increases in
emergency-room cases related to the cold.
   Most of the frostbite victims who went to the Fairbanks Memorial
Hospital emergency room in recent weeks were adults who had to walk
in the cold after their cars quit running, said Susan McLane, a
nursing supervisor.
   The victim of the boating accident was identified as 35-year-old
Scott St. Clair. A companion who was in another skiff told the Coast
Guard that St. Clair was caught in 10- to 15-foot seas and 55 mph
winds Monday evening.
   In Anchorage, firefighters remained busier than usual responding
to reports of water-spewing pipes that broke with the cold, and a
surge in residential fires, many traced to attempts to thaw frozen
pipes.

<HEAD>Prosecutor to Consider Allegations Against Congressman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A county prosecutor said he'll review a
police investigation involving U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens which a
television station says dealt with the congressman's alleged
involvement with a teen-age girl.
   Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller confirmed that Lukens,
R-Ohio, was under investigation. Miller told Columbus television
station WBNS-TV the investigation was sexual in nature but would not
elaborate.
   ``As things stand now, the finalized report should be on my desk
late (this) morning,'' Miller told The Associated Press on Tuesday
night. ``We'll go through it, look at some things and decide what
action to take.''
   Miller said it would probably take a week to review the report.
   ``Until then, I wouldn't want to speculate further,'' he said.
   Lukens, reached at his Washington home by The Associated Press
Tuesday night, said, ``I have no comment.''
   WBNS-TV quoted a Columbus woman, Annie Coffman, as saying Lukens
has been involved with her teen-age daughter over a period of years,
beginning when she was 13. The girl is now 17, the station said.
   The station reported that Ms. Coffman wore a hidden microphone
when she confronted Lukens at a fast-food restaurant in Columbus
last November. She said Lukens admitted being with her daughter and
other girls, according to the report. Police have heard a tape of
the conversation but would not comment on its contents, the station
reported.
   The woman claims Lukens offered her a government job as a bribe,
the station reported.
   Ms. Coffman said she would not discuss the case.
   ``My daughter has been through enough. She's feeling a lot of
pressure right now,'' Ms. Coffman told The Columbus Dispatch in a
story published today.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress, beginning in 1966. His
district was eliminated in 1970, and he lost a 1970 bid for governor
in the Republican primary. Lukens is from Middletown, about 35 miles
north of Cincinnati.
   After that race, he was barred from seeking public office for
five years for not filing campaign reports on time. However, that
campaign law was changed before the five-year period expired and he
was elected to the state Senate in 1974.
   He served in the state Senate until he returned to Congress in
1986, representing the 8th Congressional District in southwestern
Ohio. He was re-elected in 1988.
   In 1974, while in the state Senate, he fought allegations that he
accepted $1,000 in campaign contributions from Korean businessman
Tongsun Park during his first stint on Capitol Hill.
   He denied the charge, presenting the results of a voluntary lie
detector test he took after the allegations surfaced. Those results
indicated Lukens was not lying when he said he had not received a
campaign contribution from Park.
   Park told investigators he had contributed $850,000 in
contributions to selected congressmen in the late 1960s and early
1970s, but denied repeatedly that he was acting as an agent of the
South Korean government.

rebels in their biggest battle with the insurgents since 1986, the
army said today. The guerrillas had attacked a remote village in the
southern Philippines.
   Field reports radioed to army's headquarters in Manila said at
least 11 other people _ eight civilians, two militiamen and a
soldier _ were killed in Tuesday's fighting.
   The casualties brought to at least 62 the number of people killed
in fighting in Mindanao island's Zamboanga Peninsula since Saturday.
   Military officials said 18 communist New People's Army guerrillas
and one soldier were killed in six battles Saturday and Sunday in
Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte provinces.
   The area has a mixed Moslem and Christian population and is
roamed not only by rebels but also by bands of outlaws.
   Col. Antonio Nale, a brigade commander who led the government
troops, said the daylong battle began after about 300 rebels
attacked the village of Kulasian in Zamboanga del Sur, 510 miles
southeast of the capital, burning three houses.
   Nale said the rebels, members of the Moro National Liberation
Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, were avenging the
deaths of friends. He did not elaborate.
   The two rebel groups have been fighting for Moslem rule on
Mindanao and other southern islands since 1972, but the fighting was
reduced to occassional skirmishes during much of the 1980s. Rebel
leaders signed a cease-fire with President Corazon Aquino in 1986.
   Officials say more than 50,000 people were killed at the height
of the fighting in the mid-1970s.
   In his report, Nale said that shortly after hearing of the
attack, military officials sent gunboats to the coastal village to
prevent a sea escape by the rebels. Eight hours after the initial
rebel attack, Nale reported he was aboard a helicopter gunship which
strafed rebel positions and inflicted ``heavy casualties.''
   On the ground, a company of soldiers encountered 35 rebels and
killed one guerrilla in a brief firefight. Other troops chased the
main rebel band and had an eight-hour ``decisive engagement'' near
the village of Tinyapan, the report said.
   The latest report from the field said troops completed mopping up
operations today and recovered the bodies of at least 32 rebels.
   The report said government forces also recovered 24 firearms,
including five M-79 grenade launchers.

<HEAD>Students Given More Freedom To Interpret History In Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet students will for the first time be allowed
to present their own interpretations of history at exam time, a
newspaper reported.
   History exams were canceled last year because textbooks have been
outpaced by media reports making new revelations about the country's
past.
   Under a new system this year, teachers will be allowed to devise
their own tests and students will be permitted to disagree with
teachers and textbooks without being penalized, the national
teacher's newspaper Uchitelskaya Gazeta said.
   Final history exams were called off last year because the
textbooks on which they were based were at odds with accounts of
Soviet history being printed by the more-open Soviet media,
including the exposure of some of the atrocities under dictator
Josef V. Stalin.
   Students finishing the 10th and final grade of Soviet middle
school last year had oral discussions with their teachers instead of
exams.
   Gennady A. Yagodin, chairman of the State Education Committee,
decided history tests would resume this school year but students
will be given more leeway to interpret history, Uchitelskaya Gazeta
said in its report Tuesday.
   ``Various opinions in all questions of the history of the country
are not only allowed, they are completely natural,'' Vladimir
Shadrikov, the vice chairman of the State Education Committee, wrote
in the article.
   The old tests were part of the rigid Soviet educational system
that was based on rote learning. In the past, Soviet high school
students were expected to repeat what their textbooks told them on
given subjects, for example, on the foreign policy guidelines laid
down by the 27th Communist Party Congress.
   Shadrikov said the only criterion for the new history exams is
that they be structured to show the maximum knowledge of a
particular student.

   Plans to appoint former Soviet human rights
activist Natan Sharansky as Israel's ambassador to the United
Nations met with considerable opposition today.
   But some news reports indicated it was likely that the
41-year-old Sharansky would win the Cabinet's approval for the post.
   In announcing Sharansky's candidacy, senior officials said Israel
hoped his international popularity could boost Israel's image, which
has been tarnished by the Palestinian uprising.
   Arguments against Sharansky's appointment have focused on the
short time he has spent in Israel _ he arrived from the Soviet Union
on Feb. 11, 1986 _ and his past. Sharansky served nine years in
Soviet prisons and labor camps on charges of spying for the United
States, charges he denies.
   The fear is that the choice of Sharansky's for the high-profile
post could insult Moscow just as Israel is trying to rebuild ties
the Soviets severed 21 years ago over its seizure of Arab lands in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Two Israeli newspapers quoted unnamed officials in the U.S. State
Department as warning that giving Sharansky such a high-ranking
diplomatic post could derailing efforts to restore ties with Moscow.
   Israeli officials expressed similar concerns and a popular
columnist for the Haaretz newspaper compared the Sharansky
designation with appointing Jonathan Pollard, an American convicted
of spying for Israel, as ambassador to Washington if he were freed
from jail.
   The Hadashot and Maariv newspapers asserted, however, that the
Soviets would not be offended by Sharansky's appointment because the
Kremlin now has a more liberal emigration policy.
   Israel radio said Foreign Ministry officials objected to the move
both out of diplomatic concerns and because it would violate a
longstanding practice of requiring a new immigrant to live at least
11 years in the country before becoming a foreign diplomat.
   Right-wing Israeli officials were concerned that Sharansky was
not well enough versed on the Arab-Israeli conflict, citing meetings
he once held with Faisal Husseini, a pro-PLO leader in the occupied
territories. Sharansky had said he was not aware of Hussein's ties
to the PLO.
   Sharansky, the symbol of the Soviet Jewry emigration struggle,
immigrated after a dramatic East-West swap of people imprisoned on
spying charges.
   Despite the criticism, Hadashot predicted Sharansky would win the
appointment and said Foreign Minister Moshe Arens was simply waiting
for Sharansky's response to the bid.
   Sharansky said Tuesday he had not been officially offered the job
and declined to comment.
   Today, Sharansky indicated he would consider the offer seriously.
He was quoted by the Hadashot daily as saying:
   ``The job of U.N. ambassador is honorable and important and in
the meantime I thank everyone who is proposing me for this lofty
job. When there is really something to talk about, I will talk.''
   But a government official said Sharansky had also indicated he
was hesitant about the offer.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sharansky
was concerned about whether he could succeed despite his lack of
diplomatic experience, and that his wife, Avital, objects to leaving
Jerusalem.
   Mrs. Sharansky was also quoted by the Yediot Ahronot newspaper as
saying, ``I want to have a lot of children and would prefer to do so
here in Jerusalem.'' The couple now has two daughters, Rachel, 2,
and Hannah, two months.

<HEAD>Crash Victim, Husband Awarded $800,700 for Continental Airlines Negligence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survivor of a 1987 Continental Airlines crash has
been awarded slightly more than $800,000 in damages, about half what
Continental officials say she was offered in an out-of-court
settlement.
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated three days before awarding
$779,000 to Karen Johnson of Boise, Idaho, plus $21,700 for her
husband, Bob Cook. The jury reached the verdict Tuesday.
   The couple was denied punitive damages.
   Johnson suffered a damaged heart muscle and permanent double
vision from nerve damage in the Nov. 15, 1987, crash of Continental
Flight 1713 at Denver's Stapleton International Airport.
Twenty-eight people died and 54 were injured in the crash.
   Continental attorney Bob Harris said the $800,000 award was
appropriate and said Continental had approached the couple before
the trial with a $1.6 million settlement proposal that was rejected.
   Johnson said she was hopeful that her lawsuit would prompt
Continental to learn from its mistakes. ``I hope it will cause
reforms at Continental and all other airlines that cut corners,''
she said.
   The verdict followed nearly three weeks of testimony before U.S.
District Judge Sherman Finesilver.
   The jury cited Continental for ``reckless and willful
misconduct'' and for misleading advertising that falsely underscored
the airline's concern for safety.
   The panel also found negligence on the part of the Federal
Aviation Administration because of the conduct of flight controllers
who allowed the Continental DC-9 to sit on a runway in a snowstorm
more than 20 minutes after undergoing de-icing.
   The plane was bound for Boise when it crashed.
   Richard J. Hillman, Continental vice president for flight
operations, said Continental already has paid $20 million in
out-of-court settlements in 36 other crash-related lawsuits.
   Johnson had claimed Continental relaxed its pilot training
requirements and shortchanged its de-icing procedures to pay for
market expansion and advertising.
   Continental has admitted partial responsibility for the crash,
but said it also believed the FAA was to blame because of the
takeoff delay.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has ruled that the crash
was caused by a combination of weather factors and pilot errors.

<HEAD>Sentences Up to Two Years For Palestinian Stone Throwers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military court sentenced six Palestinians to
up to two years in prison for throwing stones, and an army official
said today that the unusually harsh sentences were intended to deter
other youths.
   Two of the defendants sentenced Tuesday were teen-agers, and in
at least three cases the punishment was for throwing stones at
soldiers.
   No one was hurt in the stone-throwing incidents, the army
official said, but added, ``Stones have the potential of causing
death, just like live ammunition.
   ``The fact that no one was injured cannot necessarily be held to
the credit of the defendants,'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``The punishment was meted out not only as a
punishment, but also as a deterrent for the defendants and the
general public.''
   Meanwhile in the occupied Gaza Strip today, four people were shot
and wounded in clashes between troops and stone-throwing
Palestinians, Arab doctors said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, assailants hurled a firebomb at an
Israeli bus on a main thoroughfare, wounding the driver, police said.
   Police blocked off the street and aimed water cannons spewing
yellow liquid at nearby shops, breaking a half-dozen shop signs,
witnesses said. Three Arab schoolgirls were detained, police said.
   Tuesday's prison terms were unprecedented in severity. In the
past, stone-throwers have received only fines or jail terms of
several months.
   The sentences for the six ranged from 18 to 24 months in prison,
plus suspended terms of 18 to 40 months and fines of $417 to $833.
   The Israeli daily Haaretz said three of the incidents involved
stone-throwing at soldiers. It said the defendants were aged 15 to
22.
   The military has tried various tactics in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank to halt stone-throwing, which army officials have called the
most persistent problem since the Palestinian uprising began nearly
14 months ago.
   An early policy of beating Palestinians caught rioting was less
used after the practice raised criticism abroad. The firing of
plastic bullets and rubber-coated steel balls also was criticized by
human rights groups after more than 50 deaths resulted from their
use, but use of the ammunition continues.
   At least 37O Palestinians have been killed, most by army gunfire
since the uprising against Israeli occupation began. Fifteen
Israelis also have died.
   The sentences Tuesday are part of the latest get-tough policy
introduced by the army last month.
   Other measures include demolishing houses of some stone throwers
and permission for troops to fire plastic bullets at Palestinians
running away from a stone-throwing incident or erecting stone
roadblocks.

   A battle that began a year ago today when
two Indians took over a small-town newspaper to draw attention to
alleged corruption remains unresolved, with the two fugitives suing
the state.
   Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs, who were acquitted in December
on federal hostage-taking charges in connection with the siege in
Lumberton, filed the lawsuit Tuesday, alleging the state was
harassing them by filing separate charges.
   The lawsuit also was filed by the Robeson County Defense
Committee, a group of Indians and blacks formed during the past year
to voice concern about ``oppression.''
   Jacobs' attorney, Lewis Pitts, said the group's involvement in
the lawsuit shows the people of Robeson County ``are a changed
people.''
   ``No longer will they sit by and take the reign of terror and the
oppression, and this lawsuit reflects their changed attitude,'' said
Pitts.
   ``They are calling the emperor naked. That's the positive spirit
here one year after the takeover.''
   Hatcher says he doesn't see an end to the standoff.
   ``Just because I'm not in North Carolina doesn't mean I'm not in
their hair,'' he said in a telephone interview from Idaho, where he
is seeking sanctuary with the Shoshone-Bannock Indians.
   Brandishing sawed-off shotguns, the Tuscarora Indians walked into
The Robesonian newspaper office in Lumberton, and took up to 20
hostages.
   They said they had evidence of law enforcement involvement in
drug trafficking in Robeson County, whose population is evenly
divided between blacks, whites and Indians. Hatcher also said
federal officials were repeatedly presented with information
concerning racial injustice and police corruption in Robeson County
over the years, but failed to rectify the problems.
   Gov. Jim Martin ended the siege without injuries to the hostages
by agreeing to form a task force to investigate the allegations.
   Hatcher and Jacobs were charged with federal firearms violations
and hostage-taking, held in a federal prison at Butner, then moved
through a series of county jails while awaiting trial.
   They were denied bond three times before a three-judge panel of
the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered their release in July. The full
appeals court later agreed to reconsider that decision and ordered
them back to jail.
   Jacobs complied, but Hatcher fled and surfaced a few days before
his trial in September with a lawyer from the Center for
Constitutional Law in New York.
   After a three-week trial, a federal jury on Oct. 14 acquitted the
two of all charges.
   Hatcher and Jacobs had met with the task-force panel once, but it
concluded there was no evidence to back up their charges.
   On Dec. 6, a special session of the Robeson County grand jury
indicted the pair on 14 charges of second-degree kidnapping. Hatcher
was arrested at the offices of the Robeson County Defense Committee
that day, but Jacobs fled to New York.
   Hatcher was freed on $25,000 bond, which was posted by the
National Council of Churches, but jumped bail and fled to the
Onondaga Reservation near Syracuse, N.Y., where Jacobs was hiding.
Hatcher later left New York for Idaho.
   Jacobs was arrested Dec. 13 outside the reservation after fleeing
from a state trooper and crashing his car into an empty school bus.
His $25,000 bond also was posted by the National Council of Churches.
   Hatcher failed to make a court appearance in Robeson County
earlier this month, saying he feared for his life should he return,
and his bond was ordered forfeited. Jacobs' extradition is pending.
   The lawsuit says the state charges are just ``intimidation and
harassment,'' and asks a federal judge to block their extradition
and declare the state charges unconstitutional.
   It asks for at least $10,000 in damages from each of the 20
defendants and a judgement ``declaring unconstitutional the campaign
of intimidation and harassment'' it alleges is being conducted in
Robeson County.
   The lawsuit, which was filed by the defense committee, names
Martin, state Attorney General Lacy Thornburg, and several other law
enforcement officials as defendants.
   Thornburg said the state did not intend to stop pressing for
extradition.
   ``It is clear that this lawsuit represents a thinly disguised
effort to prevent the state of North Carolina from pursuing the
extradition and criminal prosecution of Mr. Hatcher and Mr. Jacobs
for holding 14 innocent people at gunpoint and against their will,''
Thornburg said.
   ``The state will do everything within its power to see that these
individuals are extradited to North Carolina to stand trial on state
charges.''

<HEAD>11-Year-Old Arrested With 411 Crack Vials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old showed up for class carrying a bag
stuffed with 411 vials of crack that he claimed to have brought from
home, police said.
   ``It looked almost like a lunch bag,'' housing police Officer
Joseph DeLuca said after the boy's arrest Tuesday.
   The boy, Mark Birmingham, is in a class for the severely
emotionally handicapped, said Paul Berczeller, a teachers union
spokesman.
   It was unclear whether the boy was being used as a drug courier
or simply took the crack to the Bronx school to show his fifth-grade
classmates, housing police Capt. Samuel Hellman said.
   Police today sought Mark's 17-year-old brother, Michael, who Mark
claimed had given him the drugs.
   ``I got it from home,'' DeLuca quoted the boy as saying.
   Several students saw the boy take the bag from his coat and slip
it into a desk drawer, said Principal Joseph Cordasco.
   The boy was brought to the school office clutching the bag, he
said. A teacher asked to look inside and found the $5 vials of
crack, mostly in packs of 10.
   Mark's mother, Beverly, was summoned to the school and ``was very
upset but she just wanted to talk to a lawyer,'' DeLuca said.
   Mark was charged as a juvenile with possession of narcotics and
taken to a youth detention center. He was to appear today in Family
Court.
   A 12-year-old brother was turned over to the Bureau of Child
Welfare, said Sgt. Pete Berry, a police spokesman.
   Schools Chancellor Richard Green said the arrest ``reaffirms my
belief that drugs are the most serious problem our young must
confront.''

   A weapons manufacturer is about to give buyers a
whiff of war.
   BEI Defense Systems is promoting its ``extraordinarily lethal''
Flechette rockets with scratch-and-sniff advertisements in trade
publications.
   The ads, emblazoned with the slogan ``The Smell of Victory,''
release the smell of cordite, the aroma that follows a rocket
explosion.
   ``My advertising usually gets lost in magazines,'' said George
Coutoumanos, director of U.S. government programs for BEI, who came
up with the idea.
   ``I usually get buried by the big guys _ the Boeings and the
General Dynamics. Who's going to read my ad when they can look at a
beautiful F-16 going over the countryside?''
   The rocket and electronics manufacturer is small by defense
industry standards. Last year, it handled about $47 million in
defense contracts.
   Specifically, Coutoumanos is trying to convince U.S. military
buyers and other defense hardware shoppers that his $400-$800
rockets are a better value than more high-profile missiles such as
Stingers.
   ``I'd really like to hire a major star and get them to sing and
dance, but it doesn't work that way,'' Coutoumanos said. ``And
shooting off rockets on television isn't really appropriate, I
think.''
   BEI was helped in producing its advertisement by the firm Bozell,
Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt.
   Coutoumanos said the ad will debut in the Feb. 1 international
editions of the Armed Forces Journal.
   ``Next year, I'm going to do the `Sound of Victory,''' he said.
``You're going to run your thumbnail across some kind of strip and
you will hear the explosions.''

<HEAD>Costa Rica May Send Hijacker Back To Colombia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who hijacked a Colombian
airliner and threatened to set fire to one of the 122 people aboard
was overpowered by the co-pilot before the plane landed in Costa
Rica, a passenger said.
   Police arrested the hijacker after the Boeing 727 landed Tuesday
at the Juan Santamaria airport near San Jose, said Interior Minister
Carlos Disanti.
   The Red Cross treated some passengers for shock, officials said,
but no other injuries were reported to them or the six-member crew.
   The hijacker, who reportedly carried two orange juice cartons of
gasoline fitted with wicks, commandeered the Ace airlines flight
about 10 minutes after it left San Andres Island, Colombia, for
Medellin, Colombia.
   The Public Security Ministry identified the hijacker as
Nicaraguan exile Alvin Antonio Siu and said he will either be
charged in Costa Rica or deported to Colombia. Three other
passengers were questioned and released, it said.
   ``The hijacker during the flight told the pilot, Jaime Perez, he
would burn a passenger alive if he did not divert the flight to
Costa Rica,'' said a Costa Rican air traffic controller, Carlos
Paniagua.
   Humberto Campos, a passenger who was sitting toward the front of
the plane, said passengers noticed the man when they saw he was
carrying orange juice cartons and speaking nervously with a flight
attendant.
   ``Then he spoke with the captain and told him to divert the plane
to any Central American country, Jamaica or Miami, but the captain
persuaded him to land somewhere close because of lack of fuel,''
Campos said. He said the cabin door was open and passengers could
hear the conversation.
   The co-pilot overpowered the hijacker and took the cartons away
when the man looked out one of the cabin windows shortly before
landing, Campos said.
   The hijacker's motives were unclear, but Radio Reloj reported it
received an anonymous telephone call saying the hijacker was seeking
the release an American and several Colombians held in Costa Rica on
drug charges.
   The report did not identify those being held.
   Hernan Garron, the Public Security minister, said Siu was a
Miskito Indian living on San Andres Island. Thousands of Miskito,
Sumo and Rama Indians fled Nicaragua's Atlantic region in 1981 after
the Sandinista government tried to impose control on their
traditionally autonomous area.
   Some Indians remained behind to fight the government, and the
Sandinistas eventually reached peace agreements with some Indian
groups.

<TEXT>
   An electric stove caused the fire that
killed a pro-Solidarity priest, a church official said today.
   ``The final results of an inspection of the scene are not
available yet, but I can say the cause of the fire was an electric
stove in a little room next to the bedroom,'' said the Rev. Cezary
Potocki.
   ``It even caused the floor boards to burn up. There are still a
lot of questions, but to a great extent one can say the stove caused
the fire,'' Potocki said.
   The Rev. Stanislaw Suchowolec, 31, died Monday from smoke
inhalation in the northeastern city of Bialystok. His death provoked
controversy because another priest, the Rev. Stefan Niedzielak, 74,
died of a broken neck Jan. 21.
   The government said today that the inquiry was continuing into
the Niedzielak's death. Niedzielak was primarily known for a shrine
he maintained to Poles killed in the Soviet Union during World War
II, but also was sympathetic to Solidarity.
   The government said Tuesday it has no evidence the priests'
deaths were politically provoked.
   ``There is no ground to suppose that there is someone going
around Poland and spreading death among priests,'' government
spokesman Jerzy Urban said. ``There is no evidence to assume or
suppose the existence of a political provocation.''
   A housekeeper sounded the alarm after smelling smoke early
Monday, Urban said. Another priest found Suchowolec and his dead dog
lying next to a couch in the bedroom, he said.
   Potocki said Suchowolec's funeral would be held Friday at the
Immaculate Heart of Mary's Church in Bialystok, a city 120 miles
north of Warsaw.
   Potocki, chancellor of the Bialystok Curia, attended the autopsy
on Suchowolec's body.
   Suchowolec was an active supporter of the banned trade movement
Solidarity.
   Early in his six years as a priest, he served for three years as
a vicar in Suchowola, home village of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a
pro-Solidarity priest who was murdered by security police in 1984.
Suchowolec had organized pilgrimages to Popieluszko's grave in
Warsaw.
   Zofia Romaszewka, of the Solidarity Commission on Intervention
and Law Abidance, said Suchowolec had told the commission he had
been assaulted and that his car had been tampered with at least
twice.
   Zbigniew Romaszewski, another member of the commission which
records human rights' violations, said Suchowolec's car was stoned
Aug. 4, 1988 and two days later his parents' apartment was burned.
   Urban said no threats had been reported to authorities.

<HEAD>Barry Sadler's Feuding Family Agrees To Independent Guardian</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After a month of public feuding, the family of
brain-damaged singer-composer Barry Sadler of ``Ballad of Green
Berets'' fame has agreed to the appointment of an independent
guardian to handle his affairs.
   The agreement was announced Tuesday by Probate Judge John J.
Donnelly following two days of hearings on Sadler's mental
competence.
   While the judge agreed Sadler was incompetent to handle his
affairs, he said he had no jurisdiction to rule in the case because
Sadler is not an Ohio resident.
   At the same time, Sadler's family has agreed to let a probate
judge in Nashville, Tenn., name an independent guardian, Donnelly
said.
   Sadler's mother, Bebe, and son, Thor, 24, had made competing
appeals to be named his guardian.
   Under the agreement, the guardian must consult with family
members before making major decisions for Sadler, according to
Donnelly, who said relatives indicated a preference for naming as
guardian a Vietnam veteran like Sadler.
   Sadler, a former member of the Army's Special Forces unit, wrote
and performed ``The Ballad of the Green Berets'' in 1965 in honor of
the unit. He since has written a series of books on military themes.
   He was interviewed by Donnelly at Southwest General Hospital in
suburban Middleburg Heights on Monday. ``The responses were
confusing,'' said Donnelly.
   The 48-year-old Sadler, who has a home in suburban Nashville,
repeatedly referred to this year as 1980 even after being told the
correct date, and could name only two of his three children, the
judge said.
   Sadler was shot in the head last year in Guatemala City, where he
had lived for five years. The circumstances of the shooting have
never been disclosed.
   Psychologist Gintautas Z. Sabataitis testified that Sadler was
competent but ``severely limited'' in his abilities and needed a
guardian.
   Sadler had been treated at the Nashville Veterans Administration
hospital before being sent to Cleveland Nov. 8 for further treatment
and rehabilitation.

   Students from the Soviet Union, the United States,
Western Europe and Africa today sent a letter to Chinese authorities
accusing them of racism.
   A group of African students mailed another letter to all African
embassies in Beijing, charging African countries have ordered their
students to stay in China even though the students want to leave.
   An African diplomat denied the claim.
   Attached to the African students' letter was a separate protest
note in which 44 African students from Nanking demanded their
countries let them go home.
   The letter-writing campaign follows a brawl between African
students and Chinese on Christmas Eve in Nanking.
   Official Chinese reports said 11 Chinese and two Africans were
hurt in the fighting at Hehai University. Chinese students say the
fight began when two Chinese women refused to identify themselves as
they entered the university with two African men. African students
say it started with Chinese students and teachers attacking African
students for no reason.
   In the letter to authorities, 140 foreign students from about 35
countries, including many black African countries, Australia and
Japan, accused Chinese officials of planning the Hehai University
brawl and stage-managing subsequent anti-African protests in Nanking.
   The letter referred to developments in the first week of January,
which ended with 400 Chinese police raiding a guest house outside
Nanking.
   ``Many of us were beaten, some with electric prods, while all of
us were restricted phone calls, visits from our diplomats or friends
and the freedom to leave,'' said the letter. ``We were treated like
prisoners as if we were guilty.''
   In the letter to their embassies, African students said their
countries have begun ``to threaten and order their students to go to
school against the initial demand of the students.'' Hundreds of
African students in Nanking and Beijing remain on strike.
   The letter called on the goverments to let their students go home.
   ``We could not understand how the diplomatic corps would seek to
sacrifice its students for a racism-infested friendship'' with
China, the letter said. ``We should advise our diplomatic missions
not to sell our birthrights for friendship.''
   Kwadwo Kwakye, acting ambassador for Ghana, denied his country
has ordered any of its 26 students to stay in China, as students
charge.
   One Ghanaian student, Alex Dosoo, was arrested after the brawl in
Nanking and jailed for a month.
   He was released Jan. 24, a day before President Moussa Traore of
Mali, the president of the Organization of African Unity, came to
China. The organization had criticized China's handling of the fight
and later protests.
   China initially ordered Dosoo and two other African students
allegedly involved in the fray, out of the country, but later
reversed the decision.
   One man, Alpha Robinson of Gambia, left.
   Kwakye denied students charges today that African embassies are
pressuring Dosoo and Boni Lodovic to stay in China and transfer to
another university. Both have said repeatedly that they want to go
home.
   Kwakye said Dosoo is free to return home.
   Few of the students have money to pay their fares.
   More than 1,500 African students study a variety of subjects
ranging from agriculture to literature in China, mostly on Chinese
scholarships.

<HEAD>Buddhist Monks Begin Rites For Panchen Lama</HEAD>

   Conch-shell horns wailed and cymbals clanged today
as Beijing's small community of Lamaist Buddhists began three days
of mourning for the Panchen Lama, their second-ranking religious
leader.
   ``He was very good to us,'' said one young monk at Beijing's
Yonghe Temple, the only Lamaist Buddhist temple in the capital.
   Most of the approximately 80 monks, or lamas, who live at the
temple are Mongolian, but they belong to the same branch of Buddhism
as Tibetans. Like Tibetans they looked to the Panchen Lama as their
highest religious leader inside China.
   The Panchen Lama died Saturday of a heart attack in Tibet. He was
50.
   He was outranked in Lamaist Buddhism, generally called Tibetan
Buddhism, only by the Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India
since an abortive Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.
   The Panchen Lama is revered as the 10th reincarnation of the god
Amitabha. The monks at the Yonghe Temple said they hope he soon will
be reincarnated an 11th time, but one added, ``It is up to the
Buddha to decide.''
   The temple compound in northern Beijing is a popular tourist
place for Chinese and foreigners, but its huge red doors were closed
today for three days of mourning.
   Inside, red-robed monks and a few dozen Tibetans who live in
Beijing chanted the ``Thousand Lamp Offering'' scripture, which one
monk said was an ancient scripture traditionally read when someone
has died.
   Several monks periodically blew on conch-shell horns and beat
drums and cymbals, while the chant-master laid long white silk
scarves, called hada, in offering on an altar that bore a photograph
of the Panchen Lama. Offerings of fruit and cakes also surrounded
the photograph.
   The smoke from hundreds of small butter lamps mingled with
incense that rose threadily in the drafty Wheel of the Law Hall. The
monks, who sat cross-legged in front of the altar, gulped mouthfuls
of hot butter tea between chapters.
   Religious authorities have not said when the Panchen Lama's
funeral will be held. A government funeral committee has been set up
headed by President Yang Shangkun, and the State Council, China's
cabinet, has ordered a memorial hall be built in Tibet to house the
Panchen Lama's body.
   The body remains in Xigaze, Tibet's second-largest city, where he
was dedicating a shrine when he died.
   The Panchen Lama was educated from his teens by the communists,
and was their most credible spokesman to the Tibetans. He supported
Chinese communist rule in Tibet and generally backed their policies.
   However, he spoke out several times against what he considered
overly harsh treatment of Tibetans, and was punished for it in the
1960s with nine years of house arrest.
   The government has indicated it will allow an 11th reincarnation
of the Panchen Lama to be selected. Traditionally, it takes several
years for religious authorities to identify a child in whom the
Panchen Lama's spirit is believed to have been reborn.
   Generally the child is expected to be able to identify his
possessions from previous lives and has certain physical similaries
to his predecessors.

   A British soldier died early
today from wounds sustained in a bomb blast outside a Belfast pub,
police said. A second soldier suffered slight injuries.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting British
rule in the province, claimed responsibility for Tuesday night's
explosion in a coded message to news organizations.
   A press officer at police headquarters said infantryman Pvt.
Nicholas David Peacock died after a bomb exploded as his joint
army-police foot patrol passed a pub in the Falls Road section of
West Belfast, an IRA stronghold.
   The police press officer, who in accordance with British practice
declined to be identified, said: ``The bomb was concealed in a
drainpipe on the wall of the pub.'' He said it consisted of about
two pounds of commercial explosives.
   The soldier underwent emergency surgery on his legs but died in
the hospital.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the
predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Greenpeace said a Japanese whaling fleet
it has been monitoring stopped hunting in Antarctica today, but a
Japanese official said the environmental group will not halt the
fleet's mission.
   Greenpeace spokesman Paul Bogart said the Japanese ships had
stopped harpooning whales in a ``a major victory'' for the
environmental organization, whose ship Gondwana has been trailing
the fleet for a week.
   ``It looks like they are trying to sit us out,'' Bogart said by
radio telephone from the Gondwana.
   ``They spotted a pod of 12 Minke whales but sailed right through
them. Maybe they are just tired of the hassles and are waiting for
us to leave.''
   Bogart said the Gondwana today sent up a helicopter to harass the
Japanese whaling boats when the whales were spotted. On Tuesday, the
Greenpeace ship collided with a Japanese whaling vessel. No injuries
were reported.
   In Tokyo, a whaling official said he had no reports the fleet had
stopped working but said the ships may be forced to do so ``when and
if it encounters harassment'' from Greenpeace ``in a way that would
endanger ... lives.''
   ``Any such suspension would not mean that the fleet has stopped
research whaling,'' said Hisashi Hiroyama of the Fisheries Agency.
``The fleet will not return home until it accomplishes its research
mission in April.'' He said tactics used by the Greenpeace vessel
were ``tantamount to terrorism.''
   Japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its
scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _ despite
a moratorium imposed by the International Whaling Commission.
Greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi
restaurants in Japan.
   The Greenpeace ship, carrying a crew of 19, is visiting
Antarctica as part of its campaign to have the frozen continent
declared a world park.
   Another Greenpeace spokesman, Peter Wilkinson, said the Gondwana
will continue to shadow the Japanese fleet for another ``day or
two,'' then journey to the U.S. base at McMurdo Sound, which the
group claims is heavily polluted.
   ``Then it will be fireworks,'' he said.

<HEAD>Parents Spared Jail Term As Teen Daughter Moves Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a subdivision one elderly resident
said was no place for ``screaming kids,'' a 14-year-old girl quietly
moved from her parents' home to keep them out of jail.
   Staci Elmer moved in with her married brother Tuesday after
Circuit Judge Wayne Cobb refused to block her eviction in a dispute
over deed restrictions that bar children under 15.
   The girl's parents faced 10 days in jail if their daughter _ who
turns 15 in two months _ had not moved out by 5 p.m.
   ``This morning Staci said, `I feel the whole world is against
me,''' Mrs. Elmer said Tuesday. ``It's child abuse. It is. It really
is. If I had thrown Staci out in the street, I'd be in jail or
before a judge.''
   The Elmers admit they knew that children were prohibited when
they moved into their double-wide mobile home on the back streets of
the rural community in 1987.
   The subdivision covers two blocks and is home to 17 families, all
retired except the Elmers. The neighbors took the Elmers to court,
and in August a judge upheld the deed restrictions and ordered Staci
out. The Elmers didn't budge.
   Earlier this month, another judge found the couple in contempt
and set the Jan. 31 deadline.
   The Elmers' attorney, Mary Greenwood, asked for a stay until
mid-March, when amendments to the federal housing law banning age
discrimination take effect. Cobb refused but said the teen-ager
could visit her parents.
   Staci, who will be 15 on April 7, is a student who makes A's and
B's and spends four nights a week practicing acrobatics, ballet and
other types of dancing.
   ``I'm not surprised,'' she told her mother. ``The Constitution
isn't made for kids.''
   After the hearing, Mrs. Elmer packed up clothes, two blankets,
Staci's favorite pillow, a curling iron and her daughter's dance bag.
   ``We all love Staci, and we think it's terrible what's happening
to her,'' said Terry Elmer, wife of her 25-year-old brother Darwin.
``Staci's really close to both her parents. She's got to be one of
the nicest teen-agers I've ever known.''
   ``We're all elderly people,'' said Mildred Spittler, who with her
husband, Lawrence, sued to force Staci out. ``Once the restrictions
are broken, anyone can come in here with a mess of kids, and our
quiet two streets are gone.''
   ``We don't need a bunch of screaming children,'' she said.

   President Bush, suffering from laryngitis,
canceled a speech today before the National Association of Religious
Broadcasters.
   Bush has had a cold for about a week, and his voice has been
getting raspier and hoarser over the past several days. On Tuesday,
Bush gave a speech in Norfolk, Va., and said later he had worried he
wasn't going to be able to get through it. He said he had been
``just croaking away.''
   In announcing the cancellation of today's speech, White House
deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said, ``He's feeling
absolutely superb. He has laryngitis.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle addressed the broadcasters' group on
Monday. Popadiuk said Bush would go through with a brief, scheduled
appearance this afternoon before the National Association of
Wholesale Distributors, meeting at the Old Executive Office Building.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge extended his order
allowing Central American refugees to travel beyond southern Texas
while their asylum requests are reviewed but said he probably will
revoke it in three weeks.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela, however, warned immigration
officials not to let political asylum applicants overwhelm the area
again. And he said local communities should not have to bear the
brunt of federal immigration policy.
   ``I'm disturbed about the proposition that you're saying, in
effect, it's not my problem,'' Vela told attorneys representing the
Immigration and Naturalization Service at a hearing Tuesday in a
lawsuit against the INS.
   The judge extended until Feb. 20 an order blocking the INS from
requiring asylum-seekers to stay in southern Texas while their cases
were under review.
   But he added, ``It is very likely that in 20 days this injunction
will no longer be in effect.'' He said he needed time to study the
case.
   A group of immigration attorneys sued the INS on Jan. 6, and Vela
on Jan. 9 issued a temporary restraining order blocking the INS
procedure.
   The travel restriction resulted in a squalid campsite east of
Brownsville, where more than 300 Central Americans took shelter
under cardboard and sheets of plastic.
   After Vela issued his order, hundreds of immigrants fled southern
Texas, many ending up in the Miami area.
   The only issue Vela agreed to consider in the class-action
lawsuit on behalf of asylum-seekers in southern Texas was whether
the INS enacted the change without allowing time for public comment
as required by federal law.
   Vela said he doubted whether notice and comment were required in
this case.
   Prior to Dec. 16, the INS allowed asylum-seekers who presented
themselves to the agency's Harlingen District office to travel on to
their U.S. destinations, where they often were allowed to work while
pursuing their cases.
   The district on Dec. 16 began requiring applicants to file claims
in Harlingen and await decisions there for at least 30 days, during
which they were not allowed to work.
   Justice Department attorney Allen Hausman argued for the INS that
the new procedure did not deny immigrants the right to apply for
asylum, only changed the location for applying.
   Robert Rubin, one of the attorneys suing the INS, said
asylum-seekers are better able to pursue their claims to refugee
status in cities where they have relatives and friends to help them.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today offered to
withdraw Israeli troops from some cities in the occupied territories
if Palestinians accept autonomy as a step toward solving the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   It was Shamir's most conciliatory statement yet on Israel's
future role in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``At a certain stage, when there is autonomy, the army will leave
several urban centers and be focused in some other areas,'' he told
reporters after addressing a group of visiting American rabbis.
   Shamir pointed out that a troop redeployment is called for in the
U.S.-brokered Camp David accords, which he supports.
   The 1978 accords call for electing local Palestinian
representatives to hold peace talks with Israel, along with
representatives of Egypt and Jordan.
   There would then be a five-year period of autonomy, followed by
further negotiations on the final status of the territories.
   The PLO and many Palestinians in the territories occupied in the
1967 Middle East war reject the Camp David accords and the concept
of autonomy, maintaining these ideas are intended to circumvent the
PLO and contradict Palestinian demands for an independent state.
   Shamir said the most crucial step in the peace process is to
begin negotiations. ``Once we get to this stage, positive results
will come,'' he said.
   But he reiterated that Israel will not speak to the Palestine
Liberation Organization and will not accept an independent
Palestinian state.
   Shamir outlined his views as paralleling the Camp David accords,
which led to Israel's peace treaty with Egypt.
   ``The peace process will be comprised of two stages,'' he said.
``First an interim condition and this will include full autonomy. In
the second stage (there will be) direct negotiations without
preconditions between Israel, Palestinian Arabs and Arab countries.''
   Shamir's government has been under increasing pressure to pursue
a peace initiative because of international criticism of its strong
policies in putting down the 13-month uprising in the occupied
territories and PLO chief Yasser Arafat's latest diplomatic
initiative.
   At least 370 Palestinians have been killed, most by Israeli army
gunfire, since Palestinians began their rebellion against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat made a series of statements last fall saying the PLO
accepted Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism.
   In December, the United States agreed to open a dialogue with the
PLO based on Arafat's statements, and several of Israel's European
allies have urged Israel to open talks with Arafat's representatives.

<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North urged a religious group today
to ``remember the past'' before embracing Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
   North, delivering a hard-line anti-communist speech less than an
hour before the second day of his trial in the Iran-Contra case was
to resume in U.S. District Court, said he has ``watched in absolute
amazement'' as politicians, the media and intellectual leaders
praised Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``Until we see real changes, we must be wary of what is taking
place'' in the Soviet Union, North told a packed audience at a
downtown hotel. The theme of the prayer breakfast was underscoring
the ties between the United States and Israel.
   ``Today we are being asked to ... believe that Gorbachev is good
and Arafat is all right,'' North said. ``It would be better to
remember the past.''
   But North called Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, ``one of the world's most brutal terrorists'' who has
played a role in fomenting terrorist incidents in which Americans
died. The United States recently began a dialogue with the PLO.
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, is the first person to
go on trial on charges stemming from the sale of U.S. weapons to
Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan Contras. He is
charged with 12 felonies, and has pleaded innocent to the charges.
   At the breakfast, North cracked a few jokes about the trial,
saying he could only stay a few minutes because, ``I have an
appearance elsewhere that I have been invited to.'' Then he said,
``Normally in order to speak, I have to have a subpoena.''
   Breakfast organizers said the event had been planned since last
summer. Since he left the government, North has been speaking around
the country.
   North praised the idea of providing military assistance to groups
seeking to overthrow Soviet-backed governments.
   The Afghan rebels ``drove the Red army'' out of the country
because they were given U.S. military aid, he said.

   Israeli troops and allied militiamen
today expelled two Lebanese women from the Israeli security zone in
south Lebanon, and placed four people under house arrest, police
reported.
   The expulsions raise to 76 the number of people deported from the
area this year.
   A police spokesman said Itaf Nakfour and Jamila Shoueiry were
expelled from the Christian town of Deir Mimas by Saeed Mansour,
commander of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia in the
town.
   Mansour drove the women to the Zommaraya crossing at the
northeastern edge of the zone, and the deportees walked to the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.
   The police spokesman, who by custom is not identified, said
Mansour also confined three women and a man to their homes in Deir
Mimas. The four _ Nuhad al-Ghazzi, Georgette Morqos, Malakah Mansour
and Karim Bishara _ are to be questioned about the Nov. 7 attempt to
assassinate the militia's commander, Gen. Antoine Lahd.
   According to the police spokesman, Bishara is a distant relative
of Soha Bishara, the woman who shot and seriously wounded Lahd at
his home in Marjayoun. The Lebanese National Resistance Front, a
coalition of Syrian-backed groups, claimed responsibility for the
attempt.
   Lahd was released from an Israeli hospital Jan. 2 and returned to
the security zone Jan. 22.
   Israel created the zone as a buffer against cross-border attacks
in 1985 after it withdrew most of its army three years after
invading Lebanon.

   A black motorcyclist whose slaying by a police

spread to the Liberty City neighborhood, both of them black
neighborhoods.
   Homicide victims are routinely tested for drugs. Unidentified
sources told The Herald that cocaine was present but did not say how
much.
   Roy Black, the lawyer defending Officer William Lozano on two
counts of manslaughter in the men's deaths, said the results support
the policeman's contention that Lloyd was trying to run him down.
   On Tuesday, the 11-member review panel set up by the city to
review the slaying was picketed by members of the black organization
People United to Lead the Struggle for Equality because five police
officers are on the board.
   ``That disallows it, we feel, to function as a citizens'
independent review panel,'' said PULSE spokesman Van Eubanks.
   Annie Goodman, one of five black Overtown residents on the board,
pleaded for more time. ``Don't doubt us before we take a step,'' she
said.

   Communist Party chief Stipe Suvar
rejected demands for his resignation at a key party meeting and
called today for an end to feuding between political factions.
   The session of the policy-setting Central Committee, which ended
today, was marked by deep divisions between reformers and
conservatives over ways to overcome the country's worst economic and
political crisis.
   Suvar, a reformer, is supported by Slovenia and his native
Croatia, which favor political pluralism, more democracy and radical
market-oriented reforms.
   The conservatives are led by Serbia's party chief, Slobodan
Milosevic. He has the support of poorer regions, which believe
market-oriented economic reforms will cause layoffs at
state-subsidized enterprises.
   After three days of quarreling, the two factions of the Central
Committee agreed to hold an emergency party congress before the end
of this year.
   The congress was called to solve the political and economic
crisis and to choose a new party leadership for the next four years.
   Yugoslavia, which is trying to repay a $21 billion foreign debt
and reduce a 250 percent inflation rate, is seeking to implement
basic market-oriented economic laws. The nation also is trying to
cope with a drop in living standards and an alarming increase in
labor and ethnic unrest.
   On Tuesday, the military warned it will intervene if the crisis
continues.
   Efforts to oust Suvar were defeated Tuesday when conservatives
failed to force vote on the issue in the 165-member Central
Committee. But the meeting ended in a deadlock over major political
and economic issues.
   The final decision on Suvar's responsibility was left to the
23-member ruling Politburo, but it was highly unlikely that the body
will relieve him of his duties before his term expires in June.
   ``We are divided on fundamental questions,'' Josip Vrhovec, a
Central Committee member, said late Tuesday.
   He said the split was so bad that ``within the Communist Party we
already have two different, clearly ideologically defined parties.''
   Suvar said today the party must resolve its differences and
implement ``the reforms necessary to overcome the difficult
situation in the country and to enable the Communist Party to stop
losing battle after battle.''
   The debate before his speech was broadcast live by state
television.
   ``We have to overcome the quarrelsome and intolerant thinking
that only one truth exists and that all other opinions must be
defeated,'' he said in an apparent reference to the conservatives
pushing for his resignation.
   Earlier, Suvar dismissed as ``pure fabrication'' accusations made
by supporters of Milosevic that he is biased against Serbian
interests.
   The session was marked by heated exchanges on the question of
Suvar's responsibility for alleged anti-Serbian statements made
between his political allies, mainly from the liberal northern
republics of Slovenia and Croatia, and Milosevic's supporters.
   Suvar also has drawn support from the central republic of Bosnia
and the southern region of Macedonia, as well as from some delegates
of Serbia's largely Albanian-inhabited province of Kosovo.
   Mihajlo Pesic, a Serbian Central Committee member, said that
``patriotic people and Communist Party members are asking themselves
where this leadership, which has lost confidence of the people, is
leading us.''
   ``Can this leadership take us out of the crisis?'' he asked.
   The next scheduled party congress, the highest organ of the
ruling Communist Party, was to take place in 1990. The extraordinary
congress is to take place at an unspecified date later this year.

   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
said it has tested and interviewed employees to determine who
brought a small amount of marijuana into its high-security plutonium
research facility.
   The building where scientists try to convert fuel-grade plutonium
into weapons-grade material and conduct other research has been
closed since Monday, when a tenth of a gram of pot was found in a
small plastic packet on the floor.
   The building will remain closed until the investigation is
completed, said plutonium facilities manager Arthur Toy, who could
not say how long it might take.
   The drug had been brought in past six security checkpoints and a
computer-controlled security gate, Toy said.
   The probe centered on 10 people who had been in the plutonium lab
about the time the drug was found, Toy said. The workers were
interviewed by security and took voluntary drug tests, but no
suspect has been identified, he said.
   Last year, a congressional oversight committee accused the lab of
failing to thoroughly investigate allegations of widespread drug
abuse.
   An undercover investigation led to the arrest of six lab
employees in 1986, but members of Congress and lab security
officials said the probe was stopped before it reached sensitive
areas of the lab, including the plutonium building.

<HEAD>Panel Chairman Reviewing Judicial Pay Increases</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs grafs 4 to CORRECT, saying Kastenmeier has made no decision
on whether to try to block pay raises for senior judges.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House subcommittee that
oversees federal courts says he will review proposed big pay raises
for senior judges who do no legal work.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., ``believes he will have to look
further into the senior judge question,'' staff member Mary Dixon
said Tuesday.
   Dozens of federal judges who technically are semi-retired but who
do not hear cases stand to gain large pay raises unless Congress
rejects a government salary package due to take effect a week from
today. The Associated Press reported earlier this week that as many
as a fifth of the federal judiciary's ``senior judges'' no longer
hear cases but are in line for the increases anyway.
   Ms. Dixon said Kastenmeier plans to review the matter soon with
the subcommittee's lawyer, but ``believes he has at least a month''
to study it. Asked if Kastenmeier plans an attempt to block the
proposed raises, Ms. Dixon said he has not yet made such a decision.
   Kastenmeier heads the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts and
the administration of justice.
   The pay package includes raises of about 50 percent for some
2,500 top federal officials, including members of Congress and top
executive branch employees.
   The Constitution forbids lowering judicial salaries. Ms. Dixon
said Kastenmeier is studying whether the pay raises for the senior
judges can be killed after next Wednesday but before the bigger
paychecks go out.
   A Republican member of Kastenmeier's subcommittee, Rep. Carlos
Moorhead of California, previously questioned the wisdom of raising
the salaries of those senior federal judges who no longer handle any
cases.
   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' Moorhead said, adding that the
subcommittee may want to study ``establishing some minimum work to
qualify for the raises.''
   Older federal judges who opt for senior status qualify for
active-duty pay raises even after stepping down from full-time duty.
If those judges choose the other option provided by Congress _ full
retirement through resignation _ they keep for life the same salary
they received on their last day of work.
   Most senior judges, although lightening their workload, help the
federal court system cope with the increasing number of cases. But
records indicate that as many as one-fifth of the nation's 306
senior judges, including former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, no
longer do any judicial work.
   Burger, who has not wielded a gavel since taking senior status in
1986, is in line for a $60,000 pay raise _ to $175,000 a year.
Salaries would rise from $89,500 to $135,000 for federal trial
judges; from $95,000 to $145,000 for federal appellate judges; and
from $110,000 to $165,000 for Supreme Court justices.
   Any attempts to limit or block the raises could be covered by a
1980 Supreme Court opinion written by Burger. In that case, the
court held that although Congress may not thwart judicial pay raises
once they take effect, it may do away with planned increases
``before they ... become a part of the compensation due.''

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Argentine supply ship sank in
heavy seas after running aground off Antarctica, and authorities in
the region said oil from the ship had created a 10-mile slick that
was killing wildlife.
   No one was injured in the sinking late Tuesday of the 400-foot
Bahia Paraiso, which began leaking diesel fuel after striking rocks
Saturday, the government news agency Telam reported, citing a navy
communique.
   Peter Wilkniss, director of the Antarctic program of the U.S.
National Science Foundation, said it wasn't known how many gallons
of oil had spilled but that it could be an ``incurable disaster.''
   The foundation has said the Antarctic could face ecological
calamity if all 250,000 gallons aboard the ship spilled.
   ``The ship rolled over, is lying on its side almost fully below
the water,'' Wilkniss told ABC's Good Morning America today.
   ``This is a very enclosed area. It's a bay ... bounded by a
glacier and some islands and our (research) station. So if the oil
goes into the area then it will have an effect on the shoreline, on
the ice, on the animals, the organisms, on the sediments,'' he added.
   The depth of the water was not immediately known.
   Officials from the National Science Foundation, Greenpeace, and a
U.S. research facility near the wreck said leaking fuel had killed
krill, a shrimp-like crustacean that is the main food of the baleen
whale and a vital part of the Antarctic food chain.
   ``The krill are dying; they are literally jumping out of the
water,'' the New Zealand Press Association quoted Greenpeace
spokesman Peter Bogart as saying. ``Seabirds attracted by the krill
are diving into the slick ... It's a real environmental disaster in
no uncertain terms.''
   Bogart said the information was relayed by an officer at the U.S.
Palmer Research Station, two miles from the wreck. A station
spokesman, talking to The Associated Press by telephone on condition
of anonymity, said leaking oil had caused a 10-mile slick.
   More than 300 tourists and crew were evacuated from the ship
after it ran aground about 600 miles south of Cape Horn. Salvage
efforts were hampered by 50 mph winds.
   The ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and
canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the peninsula, the National Science Foundation said
in a statement released in Washington.
   The tourists on board were to visit the research station,
Wilkniss said.
   ``It is an extremely dangerous passage to negotiate. There are
many islands, there are icebergs at times, there are many shoals and
rocks on the water,'' Wilkniss told Good Morning America. ``The
ship, according to the charts we have provided to our mariners, took
the wrong exit and entry ... to the station, and it was not aware
and was going too fast and ran on some underwater rocks that
probably were not on the Argentine chart,'' he said.
   The ship sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some
diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near Palmer Station, the
foundation said.
   The accident occurred near two areas designated sites of special
scientific interest under the Antarctic Treaty, which permits
international exploration of the continent, the New Zealand agency
said.
   Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
   Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The 316 people on board, including 82 passengers and 234 crew
members, were rescued by power boats and taken to Palmer Station.
   Most were then taken by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islands
and airlifted to the South American mainland, but 104 crewmen
remained at the station, said Jack Renerie of the National Science
Foundation.

<HEAD>Meese Signs Deal To Write Memoirs of Years With Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fortchoming book by Edwin Meese will focus on
``the Reagan era in modern political history,'' a spokesman for the
former attorney general said today.
   Henry Holt and Co. announced in New York on Tuesday that Meese
has signed a contract to write his memoirs, and they will appear in
November.
   The publishing company declined to disclose the amount of the
advance that Meese received, and spokesman Patrick Korten said he
did not know how much it was.
   Korten said Meese ``has been actively engaged in the process of
assembling material and scoping it out for the last several weeks.''
   The spokesman said he would not be assisting Meese in writing the
book.
   ``I know that he has got somebody working with him, but I think
it is more research and assemblage,'' Korten said. ``He really
intends to do a lot of the writing himself.''
   ``It is going to be focused on (former President) Reagan and
really the Reagan era in modern politics going back to his days as
governor,'' he said. ``I would be very surprised if there is an
awful lot in there about Ed Meese personally.''
   The Henry Holt announcement in New York said the book would draw
upon Meese's 22-year relationship with Reagan, which began at the
start of Reagan's political career in California in the 1960s, but
would focus on his eight-year presidency.
   In a statement released through Henry Holt, Meese said, ``There
has been much written about the Reagan administration, both by the
media and other members of his administration, and about my
activities within it. Now that that chapter is closed, I feel a
responsibility to tell everything I know about the operations of the
eight-year administration.''
   Meese, who was named attorney general after serving as White
House counselor, resigned last summer in the wake of a 14-month
criminal investigation by an independent counsel, which ended in a
decision not to prosecute. Meese declared he had been vindicated,
but a report by the Justice Department's Office of Professional
Responsibility, issued last month, said Meese violated ethical
standards in his actions on behalf of lobbyist E. Robert Wallach.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan still believed
his longtime friend did nothing wrong.
   The Henry Holt announcement said the rights to the book were
acquired during a dinner meeting in Washington in November, attended
by Meese; his wife, Ursula; Jack Macrae, Holt's editor in chief, and
Meese's agent.

   Four members of an Amish community have
been robbed since Jan. 22 but won't file charges, police said.
   ``They don't like to prosecute if it will cause somebody to get
arrested.'' said Sheriff Tom Pyrdum. ``By doing this, they more or
less encourage more to happen.''
   The latest robbery occurred Monday when two men pulled a gun on
Enos Gingerich and took $300 as he drove his horse and buggy, Pyrdum
said.
   ``What they would do is hide in a ditch in the dark, and when one
came by, jump on the buggy and rob them,'' the sheriff said.
   The Amish are noted for their sober dress and simple lifestyle.
They reject automobiles and other modern conveniences, making them
easy prey for robbers.
   Police have some suspects and may press charges, Pyrdum said.
   ``They won't sign a warrant, but we will. We'll prosecute. We'll
use the Amish as witnesses,'' he said. ``They will testify under
subpoena. They won't swear, but they will affirm.''

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
today he was ``full of good expectations and great hopes'' as he
arrived to discuss a summit to heal the 30-year-old China-Soviet
breach.
   ``We are starting our negotiations fully aware of the scale of
the forthcoming event,'' Shevardnadze said in a statement
distributed by the Soviet Embassy. ``The title theme of the
Soviet-Chinese dialogue is peace and development.''
   Shevardnadze arrived on a special Aeroflot plane that landed at
Beijing's old airport, now used only by top Chinese and foreign
leaders. He was met by his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen. The two
shook hands warmly as they stood bareheaded in a biting wind.
   Shevardnadze told reporters before stepping into his limousine he
was carrying a letter from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to
Chinese leaders. He did not reveal the contents.
   ``I reached an agreement in principle with my comrade Qian Qichen
in Moscow'' on holding a summit, he said. ``Now we're going to talk
concretely about the matter.'' Qian visited Moscow in December.
   In his written statement, Shevardnadze called Qian's visit a
``major step forward'' and added, ``We have stepped on the soil of
the People's Republic of China full of good expectations and great
hopes.''
   Shevardnadze will meet with Qian on Thursday morning. He flies to
Shanghai on Friday and meets the following day with Deng, who is in
the east coast city for the upcoming Lunar New Year.
   Shevardnadze told the Soviet news agency Tass on Tuesday he was
ready to conclude the agenda for a summit this year between
Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. He said he was bringing
concrete suggestions for a date.
   Both sides have indicated they want such a meeting in the first
half of the year. The Soviets have been courting China for several
years in an effort to heal their ideological and political quarrel,
but only in the past year has China shown equal eagerness.
   Factors include changes in Soviet policy and a sense that not
much time remains for Deng, who is 84.
   Vietnam's 10-year occupation of Cambodia has been one of the main
issues dividing China and the Soviet Union.
   However, under apparent pressure from its main ally, the Soviet
Union, Vietnam said in December it was willing to pull out by
September, and China agreed in principle to end its aid to Cambodian
rebels by then.
   The two other issues that have stood in the way of a
Chinese-Soviet reconciliation also appear nearing resolution. The
Soviet Union is scheduled to complete its troop pullout from
Afghanistan in two weeks and has announced plans to pull some troops
out of Mongolia, its ally on the Chinese border.
   The last Soviet foreign minister to visit Beijing was Andrei
Gromyko, who accompanied Nikita Khrushchev in 1959. The next year
the two countries split bitterly over leadership of the world
communist movement and a border dispute.

   Pennsylvania's auditor general today fired
18 people in her department who she said had bought jobs or
promotions under previous administrations.
   The 18 people ranged from management down to the staff level in
the 800-member department, and many worked in the field as auditors,
Auditor General Barbara Hafer said.
   Jobs and promotions were priced between $1,000 and $5,000, Ms.
Hafer said.
   Investigations by the U.S. attorney and her staff developed a
list of 25 people suspected of either buying jobs or promotions or
having jobs bought for them, Ms. Hafer said.
   ``Today's action was the only way to lift the cloud of suspicion
that has hung over those hard-working and dedicated employees of the
Auditor General's Office,'' said Ms. Hafer, a Republican who took
office two weeks ago.
   Former Auditor General Al Benedict and two top aides were among
those convicted and sentenced to prison in the job-selling case.
   Ms. Hafer's predecessor, Don Bailey, said there was not enough
evidence to fire 21 workers whose names were supplied to him by
Acting U.S. Attorney James West.
   Of the 25, one was former Deputy Auditor General Harold Imber,
who is in prison for his role in the job-selling scheme; four have
resigned or retired; two were fired under previous administrations
but won reinstatement, and 18 were dismissed.
   Ms. Hafer said she could not release any other names because of
concern that would jeopardize any legal action to uphold the firings.
   The auditor general's office audits government operations at the
state and local levels.

   Millionaire industrialist Kaspar
Villiger was elected to Cabinet today to replace Justice Minister
Elisabeth Kopp, who resigned over a drug money scandal.
   The multilingual Villiger, 47, official candidate of the
conservative Radical Democratic Party, received 124 votes from the
Federal Assembly, six more than the required absolute majority.
   Mrs. Kopp, Switzerland's first woman minister, stepped down after
admitting she warned her lawyer husband to cut his ties with a
Zurich-based, Lebanese-controlled company after she saw a
confidential report identifying it as a suspect in a billion-dollar
drug money laundering affair.
   Villiger was virtually certain of succeeding his fellow party
member in the seven-member Federal Council, Switzerland's Cabinet.
   His candidacy had formal support from the governing coalition of
Switzerland's four biggest parties, which has monopolized Cabinet
seats since 1959 under a platform promising political stability.
They are the Radical Democrats, the Christian Democrats, the Social
Democrats, and the centrist Swiss People's Party, which control 201
seats in the 246-member assembly.
   Monika Weber, a nationally popular advocate of consumer
interests, drew 33 votes from the assembly. She was nominated by the
opposition Alliance of Independents and anti-establishment Greens
party, which have a combined 17 seats in the assembly. The rest of
the votes went to other members of Villiger's party.
   With his election, Villiger's announced his 50 percent share in
the diversified family enterprise is taken over by his brother. The
company produces a variety of goods from cigarillos to bicycles and
reported sales totaling $27 million in 1988.
   Villiger also said the company will withdraw its bid to supply
the Swiss army with a new range of bicycles, to ensure no conflict
of interest.
   The new Cabinet member is expected to become defense minister,
taking over from Christian Democrat Arnold Koller, who has taken
charge of the Justice Ministry.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Insists on Limited Quotas for Hajj</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia announced today a quota
system limiting pilgrims will remain in force during this year's
Moslem pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina.
   Following deadly riots during the 1987 pilgrimage, which the
Saudis blamed on Iran, the Saudi government declared only one person
out of every 1,000 people in Moslem countries would be allowed to
visit the shrines. Previously, there were no restrictions.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's parliament speaker, disclosed Tuesday
that ``indirect contacts'' were being made ``to overcome the
problems'' that led the Saudis to sever diplomatic ties with Tehran
last April.
   One of the key problems was the pilgrimage, called the hajj.
   Rafsanjani was quoted by Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency, monitored in Cyprus, as saying: ``Hajj must cease to be a
hollow worship and should instead be turned into an active and
exhilarating assembly for the Islamic world to raise its issues and
problems.''
   The Saudi announcement, distributed by the official Saudi Press
Agency, said that in response to queries from Islamic states the
kingdom ``would like to reaffirm the necessity of adherence to the
quotas.''
   They will continue to apply ``this year and in the coming few
years'' until expansion and development schemes at the holy sites
are completed, it said.
   Iran's 1988 quota was set at 45,000, or one-third the contingent
it sent in the two previous years. That angered Iranian leaders, who
ordered a boycott of that hajj.
   In 1987, Iranian pilgrims defied a Saudi ban on political
activities and demonstrated in Mecca. Some 402 people, mainly
Iranians, were killed in ensuing clashes with Saudi security forces.
   Saudi Arabia said the pilgrims died in a stampede. But Iran
charged Saudi police opened fire on them.
   In 1986, Saudi security authorities unveiled what they said was a
plan by Iranian pilgrims to smuggle explosives and instigate riots
during the hajj.
   According to the lunar calender, hajj falls in July this year.
Every devout Moslem whether Sunni or Shiite, is obliged to make the
hajj if they can afford it.

   Billy Tipton lived life as a man,
performing as a jazz musician, appearing to have a wife and adopting
three sons. But death at age 74 revealed to fans, friends and family
that Billy Tipton was a woman.
   Donald Ball, director of Ball &amp; Dodd Funeral Home, said Tuesday
that Tipton, who died this month of a bleeding ulcer, was a woman.
   Ball said he informed Jon Clark, one of Tipton's adopted sons,
that his ``father'' was really female so Clark would not have to
learn it from the death certificate.
   ``I was just trying to break it to him gently,'' Ball told The
Associated Press on Tuesday night. ``I just didn't want him to find
out in a public office. It's been a very difficult thing to handle.''
   The Spokane County coroner was not available Tuesday for comment,
the coroner's office said.
   ``I'm just lost,'' Clark told the Spokesman-Review newspaper. He
said he learned the truth last Wednesday, four days after Tipton's
death.
   ``No one knew,'' said Kitty Oakes, the woman that Tipton had said
he married in 1960. Ms. Oakes, who separated from Tipton 10 years
ago, refused to talk about their life together, saying Tipton died
with the secret and that should be respected.
   ``The real story about Billy Tipton doesn't have anything to do
with gender. He was a fantastic, almost marvelous, and generous
person,'' she said.
   ``He'll always be Dad,'' Clark said. ``But I think that he should
have left something behind for us, something that would have
explained the truth.''
   Ms. Oakes told funeral directors that Tipton was born Dec. 29,
1914, in Oklahoma City and was raised in Kansas City, Mo.
   The newspaper said Tipton apparently began appearing as a man to
enhance his chances of success as a jazz musician.
   ``He gave up everything,'' Ms. Oakes said. ``There were certain
rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a
musician.''
   Tipton, a saxophone and piano player, performed with the Jack
Teagarden, Russ Carlyle and Scott Cameron bands, then formed the
Billy Tipton Trio in the 1950s and played nightclubs throughout the
West.
   Dick O'Neil, who played drums with the trio for 10 years,
recalled some listeners made cracks that Tipton, with a baby face
and a high singing voice, looked too feminine to be a man.
   ``But I would almost fight anybody who said that,'' O'Neil said.
``I never suspected a thing.''
   Scott Miller, 27, Tipton's oldest adopted son, said Tipton died
broke and tired.
   ``Now I know why I couldn't get him to a doctor,'' Miller said.
``He had so much to protect and I think he was just tired ... of
keeping the secret.''
   ``You can imagine the pressure he lived with,'' Clark said. ``Who
knows? Maybe that's what gave him the ulcer that ended up killing
him.''

<HEAD>Sawyer Said Leaving ``60 Minutes'' for ABC News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diane Sawyer is leaving CBS-TV's long-running
``60 Minutes'' program to take a job at ABC News, The Washington
Post said today.
   The newspaper said ``60 Minutes'' executive producer Don Hewitt
on Tuesday night confirmed rumors of Sawyer's possible departure
from the show, where she has been a correspondent since 1986.
   ``It's true,'' Hewitt told the Post. ``She's my friend and I'm
going to miss her.''
   There was no immediate confirmation from ABC, the Post said.
   The newspaper said ABC News President Roone Arledge had discussed
with Sawyer's agent, Richard Leibner, the possibility that Sawyer
could be a co-anchor with Sam Donaldson on an upcoming Thursday
night magazine show.
   ABC News reportedly has been after Sawyer for some time, the Post
said, adding that NBC two years ago made two separate offers to her.
One was for a program of her own, and the other was for
co-anchorship of the ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw, the Post
said.
   CBS kept her services with a contract reported to be worth $1.3
million a year, the newspaper said.
   When she renewed her contract, CBS reportedly said she could host
a revived version of the old ``Person to Person'' show that had been
hosted by the late Edward R. Murrow.
   She also was to be given the chance to be co-anchor on other
specials, the Post said. Those offers died in the midst of recent
personnel changes, it said.
   Hewitt said he has not yet considered who would be Sawyer's
replacement on the show.

<HEAD>Irish Ambassador Hopes Hostages Will Be Freed Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irish Ambassador Patrick McCabe said today
he hopes some foreign hostages held in Lebanon will be released soon.
   McCabe, who is based in Iraq, has been in Lebanon since Saturday
trying to verify news reports that Irish hostage Brian Keenan was
about to be freed.
   ``I hope that what was said about the hostages ... might prove to
inaugurate positive developments in regards to the hostages before
too long,'' he said.
   McCabe spoke to reporters after a 30-minute meeting in Moslem
west Beirut with Salah Staitieh, chief of the Foreign Ministry's
political department. He refused to comment on the talks.
   Nabih Berri, who heads the Shiite Moslem Amal militia, predicted
a rapid release of the hostages in a statement to reporters in
Damascus on Monday.
   He spoke after a truce between his pro-Syrian militia and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah ended their nine-month war in south Beirut
and southern Lebanon. The Amal-Hezbollah accord was sponsored by
Syria and Iran.
   ``The peace pact did not refer directly to the hostages, but I am
sure that this agreement would help the release of hostages as
quickly as possible,'' Berri said.
   Amal is not involved in hostage-taking. Hezbollah is believed to
be the umbrella for pro-Iranian fundamentalist factions holding most
of the 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   McCabe said the Irish government was ``in touch with all the
governments that might be in a position to render assistance in
terms of securing the early release.''
   Keenan, 38, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 as he walked to the
American University of Beirut where he taught English. No group has
claimed his abduction.
   McCabe said Keenan's kidnappers have not contacted him.
   ``No organization has indicated who should get in touch with me
or with other representatives of the Irish government on this
subject,'' McCabe said.
   In addition to Keenan, who also holds British citizenship, the
captives in Lebanon are nine Americans, three Britons, an Italian
and a Belgian.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<DATELINE>STREATOR, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took five shotgun blasts from police to
drop a 70-pound pit bull named Mongo after it terrorized a newspaper
carrier and charged officers.
   ``It sounded like World War III,'' Mongo's owner, Gale Sneath,
said after police killed his pet in the neighborhood.
   Sneath described the animal as an excellent watchdog and ``simply
mean'' to strangers; police said it was the neighborhood bully whose
nasty disposition prompted the City Council to enact a strict
ordinance governing pit bulls.
   Police Chief Ken Sangston ordered officers to destroy the dog on
Friday after it chased 11-year-old Kara Danko as she delivered
newspapers in this town of 15,000 located about 100 miles southwest
of Chicago.
   ``We'd had an ongoing ordeal with the same dog over the last two
years,'' Sangston said Tuesday. ``We'd had several citizens
complaints and its owner was arrested on a previous occasion for
letting the dog run at large.
   ``We had reports of the dog chasing kids, pedestrians, the
mailman and a newspaper carrier. We knew the dog was vicious and I
told my officers that if the dog attacked, I wanted the dog
destroyed.''
   The showdown came after Miss Danko was trapped on a screened-in
porch, holding the door shut to protect herself from the growling,
barking animal, Sangston said. The girl called her mother, who
summoned police.
   ``It had become a menace to public safety,'' Sangston said. ``We
sent out an officer and it charged my officer, who shot the dog with
a shotgun.''
   Four times police shot Mongo in the body, only to see it get up
and continue to advance. ``It finally had to be shot in the head,''
Sangston said.
   The new city ordinance requires pit bulls be chained and caged,
with warning signs posted to alert passersby of the animal's
presence. Police have issued no citations against Sneath in Friday's
attack.

<HEAD>Former Mossad Chief Said a Suspect in 1973 Plane Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former head of Israel's secret service has
been named as a suspect in the investigation of the 1973 crash of an
Italian military plane, newspapers reported today.
   Zvi Zamir, who headed Israel's Mossad from 1968 to 1974, was
formally named by Venice Magistrate Carlo Mastelloni, said Rome's Il
Messaggero and other newspapers. The newspapers said Mossad was
suspected of seeking to punish Italy for what Israel considered
pro-Arab policies.
   Although he was not officially charged, Zamir is being
investigated on suspicion of sabotaging the C-47 Dakota plane, the
reports said.
   The newspaper reports could not be confirmed independently. The
magistrate was not in his office when telephoned by The Associated
Press.
   The Israeli government today refused comment on the reports
concerning Zamir, who is now in charge of Israel's oil refineries in
Haifa.
   However, the Israeli newspaper Hadashot quoted Avi Pazner,
spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, as calling
the accusations against Zamir ``a bunch of speculation.''
   Zamir was not immediately available today, but his wife said he
would have no comment on the report.
   A few days before the Nov. 23, 1973 crash, the same military
plane was used to transport several suspected Palestinian terrorists
to Malta, the reports said. The Palestinians had been arrested at
Ostia outside Rome while allegedly planning to attack an Israeli
airliner.
   The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Marghera near
Venice, killing four Italian military officials.
   A month ago, newspapers in Italy reported Mastelloni was
examining a possible Israeli link to the crash. The reports said the
head of Mossad activities in Italy in 1973, time, identified as Aba
Leven, was also suspected of involvement but that he died a few
years ago.
   The inquiry into the crash was reopened in 1986 after Italy's
former head of military counter-espionage, Gen. Ambrogio Viviani,
alleged in a magazine interview that Mossad had sabotaged the plane.

   A military refueling jet that crashed on
takeoff, killing all 19 aboard, appeared to veer away from a cluster
of houses before tipping onto the ground and exploding in a
mushroom-shaped fireball, witnesses said.
   ``It couldn't have been more than 50 or 60 feet off the ground,''
said Skeet Jackson, who witnessed Tuesday's crash of the
Hawaii-bound KC-135A from his back yard. ``That left wing hit the
ground and (crashed) just like these pictures of atomic bombs you've
seen.''
   Officials at Dyess Air Force Base outside Abilene and at K.I.
Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette, Mich., where the flight
originated, said the passengers included spouses of military
members, retired military members and one child.
   Members of the Air Force's Accident Investigation Board were
expected to arrive at Dyess today. However, their investigation
could be hampered by the fact that no flight data recorder was
aboard the modified Boeing 707, said 1st Lt. John Ames, deputy chief
of public affairs at Dyess. Ames said he didn't know if a cockpit
voice recorder was aboard.
   The plane's maintenance files were aboard before it crashed,
which also could hurt the investigation, officials said. ``Some were
duplicated, but not all,'' said Capt. Paul Bicking, Sawyer's chief
of public relations.
   The tanker was scheduled to refuel F-16s in the air as part of a
training mission before flying nonstop to Hawaii, the spokesman
said. The plane then would have gone to Andersen Air Force Base in
Guam for a training exercise.
   Ames said it was unclear how much fuel the plane was carrying,
but added it was enough to complete the mission and make the
eight-hour flight to Hawaii.
   The flight manifest showed that 17 of the passengers were from
Sawyer and the two others boarded at Dyess, said Master Sgt. Al
Doster, another Dyess spokesman. In addition to seven crew members,
four passengers were on active duty in the military, four were
retired military and among the four dependents was one child, Ames
said.
   Names were withheld pending notification of relatives.
   Doster said it was not uncommon for dependents to fly ``space
available'' aboard a military flight.
   But Ames said, ``If they can get there by commercial jet ...
there are certain regulations that prohibit civilians from flying
military aircraft. There are certain exceptions to that rule.''
   The plane crashed shortly after noon Tuesday near the end of the
Dyess runway, near U.S. Highway 277 six miles southwest of Abilene.
The wreckage was scattered over 2 square miles, Air Force officials
said.
   Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said initial
reports forwarded to Air Force commanders at the Pentagon and at the
Strategic Air Command suggested the problem occurred during takeoff.
   ``It was toward the end of the roll, and he apparently had no
choice but to press on,'' said one official in Washington.
   ``But he didn't have the power to get up for some reason,'' added
another.
   The sources said the plane was carrying close to a full load of
fuel _ what the Air Force calls a heavy load _ totaling 155,000
pounds.
   Kenneth Fowler, who witnessed the crash from his home near the
south end of the runway, said he sensed disaster when he first saw
the plane.
   He said he watched in horror through his kitchen window as the
airplane struggled to get airborne ``before it ran off the end (of
the runway).''
   Fowler said he knew the pilot was in trouble even before he saw
the plane.
   ``I've been watching these dudes out here for three years and you
get used to the sound,'' he said. ``Right then, I said to myself,
`He's not going to make it.'''
   Jackson said he thought the pilot tried to steer the jet away
from his home and about a dozen mobile homes. The homes are a few
hundred yards from the crash site and west of the runway.
   ``He just turned it back to the east,'' Jackson said.
   Witness Vernon Wright, 19, said the plane's crew ``never got it
off the ground. ... The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of
the smoke.''
   The plane came to rest at about a 45-degree angle, a charred wing
tipped toward the sky. Grass fires sparked by the crash burned for
more than an hour.
   The maintenance record for the KC-135A, powered by four Pratt &amp;
Whitney jet engines, was not yet available, said Lt. Col. George
Peck, a spokesman at Strategic Air Command Headquarters at Omaha,
Neb.
   Ames said the plane that crashed had been in service since 1963
and was still carrying its original engines.

<TEXT>
   The defense minister said today the government will
allow the United States to test an advanced unarmed cruise missile
over Canada.
   ``This testing is an important Canadian contribution to the
effectiveness of NATO's strategic deterrent,'' Defense Minister Bill
McKnight said in a statement.
   The missile, known as AGM-129A, is more advanced than U.S.
air-launched cruise missiles now tested in Canada. Using stealth
technology, the missile is better able to avoid detection.
   During the tests, the missile will be attached to a B-52 aircraft
which will take off from and return to its base in the United States
without landing in Canada.
   Opponents of the test argue the missile could be used as a first
strike weapon.
   Officials from Canada's Defense and External Affairs departments
told reporters today the new missile is only intended as a deterrent.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the
missile does not represent a major change in technology. They
compared the modifications to those in car models from one year to
the next.
   The missile is believed to have greater accuracy and an increased
range. McKnight said tests are expected to be conducted before March
31.
   In explaining the decision to allow the tests, McKnight said the
Warsaw Pact already has a significant and improving cruise missile
capability.
   ``We support the pursuit of mutual arms reduction, a process that
can only move ahead effectively if both sides are dealing from
equivalent positions,'' he said.
   Under a 1983 agreement, Canada allows the United States to
conduct as many as six tests a year of the air-launched cruise
missiles.
   Gordon Flowers, executive director of the Canadian Peace
Congress, doesn't think the government decision reflects Canadian
feelings.
   ``I think the general trend in Canada would prefer to see a
Canadian government that's working for disarmament and not testing
new weapons systems,'' he said today after the announcement was made.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on pay raises for retired federal
judges:
   The federal judiciary badly needs its senior judges _ judges who
... choose to stay actively at work after reaching retirement age.
But what the judiciary doesn't need are senior judges, like former
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who continue to draw full salary for
doing nothing. ...
   An estimated 20 percent of all senior judges, including Burger,
continue to draw full salary while doing no work. Their idleness is
enriching _ to them, not us.
   In Burger's case, he receives $115,000 a year. That salary is due
to rise to $175,000 (in February) unless Congress disapproves. Had
he retired when he left the court in 1986, his pension would be
$108,400.
   Burger's record of all play and no work since he took senior
status will dampen public enthusiasm for a pay increase. That's
unfortuanate; a pay boost is badly needed. ...
   Burger and other senior judges who draw full pay for doing
nothing should be required to retire. After all, if they refuse to
work, why should we pay them?

   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on congressional pay raises:
   Is it any wonder that the American people have a general distaste
for politics and politicians? It is a two-way street. Politicians
hold us in low esteem, they figure us for suckers.
   Case in point, of course, is the pay raise House and Senate
members are about to accept. Here's the line they expect us to
swallow: They really don't want this money, they really don't, and
gosh darned it, if there was any way they could stop it, well, by
golly, they sure would.
   Hey, guys, in the words of a famous philosopher, sit on it. We're
not buying anymore. We've been through it before. Remember 1987? The
Senate voted 88 to 6 against a $12,000 increase. The House followed
suit, haranguing against this needless salary boost, and rejecting
it in a voice vote.
   However, by golly, all of this humble breast-beating took place
after the raises were already in effect and it was too late to
reject them.
   Shucks. They meant well.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on the Equal Rights Amendment:
   The past year, although far from top-notch, produced some notable
gains for women.
   And an even bigger gain _ real hope for the Equal Rights
Amendment _ is not unrealistic now with a new president in the White
House. ...
   We believe (George) Bush's rise from vice president to chief
executive also gives women and their male supporters an opportunity.
As a congressman, Bush supported the ERA.
   Largely for that reason, we don't think leaders of national
women's groups should write off the ERA as a long-term goal, as some
have done.
   Passage should be pursued now.

   The Seattle Times on the border ditch:
   Waging war against drugs and illegal immigration with a four-mile
drainage ditch on the U.S.-Mexican border is an act of desperation,
with an improbable chance of success.
   History suggests that fortified barriers seldom stop invading
armies, or discourage determined people in pursuit of economic or
political freedom. ...
   A Tex-Mex version of a Maginot Line will not deter desperate
people who think a better life awaits them. The only way to tarnish
the gilded dreams about the United States is to take away the jobs
that attract economic refugees.
   Continued immigration reform and enforcement that puts a premium
on punishing exploitive employers in inner cities, on the farm or
the forests, attacks part of the problem.
   On a higher political plane, the U.S. and Mexico should explore
investment and free-trade agreements that create job opportunities
in Mexico. Both countries could benefit.
   Securing our borders with a ``buried Berlin Wall'' is not what
this country is all about.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on the Supreme Court's rejection of
quotas:
   After years of unsuccessful pleading by the Reagan
administration, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the right of state
and local governments to impose quotas to undo past racial
discrimination.
   The ruling, which invalidates a Richmond, Va., ordinance setting
aside 30 percent of the city's construction business for
minority-owned businesses, threatens hundreds of affirmative action
programs.
   In the Richmond case, the court was unimpressed that only
two-thirds of 1 percent of the city's construction contracts had
been given to minority-owned business in the past five years. ...
That's a telling figure that shows obvious discrimination. Richmond
is 50 percent black.
   The court worries that such plans could breed the kind of
discrimination once embodied in Jim Crow segregation laws, or quotas
that limited the number of Jews at colleges. The fear is unfounded.
   In one case, the main _ and only _ rationale is hatred and bias.
In the other, it's an honest attempt to correct the systematic
exclusion of black and other minority group members from jobs and
public contracts. The Richmond pattern should be clear.
   President Reagan's appointees to the court have joined in
rebuking Richmond. That's a message that will be heard in city halls
and statehouses across the country, and it's the wrong one to send.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Ariz., on federal pay raises:
   All the switches have been thrown, the signals set and the tracks
cleared for the 50 percent congressional pay increase to be
railroaded through in the dark of night on Feb. 8. ...
   Here's the plan. After impassioned speeches about ``fiscal
accountability'' and ``getting our own house in order,'' the Senate
will vote overwhelmingly against the $45,000 salary boost. But over
in the House, the pay issue will never see the light of day. Since
both houses of Congress have to vote against the raise to derail it,
it will go into effect automatically.
   If that scenario sounds familiar, it should. This is the same
scheme used just two years ago when the Democratic leadership
engineered a $12,500 congressional pay boost, increasing lawmakers'
pay to the present $89,500.
   On that occasion, the Casey Jones at the throttle, Speaker Jim
Wright, had the cheek to order a meaningless voice vote on the
salary increase the day after it automatically became law. The
lawmakers dutifully deplored the shameful looting of the treasury,
pocketed the money and snickered all the way to the bank.
   It is a perfect setup. Representatives and senators can boast to
their constituents of their opposition to wasteful spending, blaming
their personal windfall on the salary review panel composed mostly
of congressional appointees and capital insiders, a panel they
created in the first place to relieve themselves of accountability.
   Although public opinion polls show that 85 percent of Americans
oppose the pay raise, and despite tons of congressional mail
opposing the raise, the big salary grab of 1989 is a sure thing.

   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on federal pay raises:
   Congress and other top ranking officials will apparently get
their 50 percent pay raise. Opponents of the measure in the House of
Representatives are sure they won't be able to bring the matter to a
vote before the deadline. ... Opponents of the controversial pay
increase are ready to go ahead, with House Democratic leaders'
blessing, with legislation to remove the major sources of outside
income that present congressman the most chances for abuse.
   The legislation would ban honorariums, or fees that senators and
representatives receive from special interest groups for making
speeches at various functions. A congressman can now fly in to a
convention at the expense of some group, give a 10-minute speech,
and fly back to Washington with a fat speaking fee, up to $28,500
worth. The ban would prevent these thinly veiled payoffs.
   Congressmen are going to find this new salary increase isn't
going to sit well with folks back home. The House and Senate can
only save face by passing outside income restrictions like the ones
proposed, and requiring members to adhere strictly to them.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on education in the United States:
   In 1983, the U.S. Department of Education released ``A Nation at
Risk,'' a sobering assessment of education in our country. ...
   The report said ... that American students were well behind
students in other industrial nations academically, that about 23
million ... adults were functionally illiterate ... and that average
achievement of high school students on most standardized tests was
lower than 25 years ago. ...
   The findings led to an unprecedented flurry of reform activity.
... Within 12 months, some 275 task forces were formed to guide
reform efforts. Governors and legislators in 35 states acted to
strengthen high school graduation requirements.
   Perhaps even more importantly, many school systems have
undertaken fundamental reforms of age-old educational practices. ...
   We have made tremendous progress in the (past) five years ... but
the job is far from done. ...
   We must continue to apply pressure across the board to make
certain the educational reform movement keeps the initiative against
the reactionary forces arrayed against it.

   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on airplane safety:
   ``Engine falls off Piedmont jet at Chicago.''
   ``Eastern jet loses wing section over Alabama.''
   ``Boeing told carriers of possible faulty part.''
   ``Plane (a United commuter) makes emergency landing.''
   Those were the headlines of near-disasters. ... They raise
ominous doubts about America's airline safety.
   Deregulation has been a disaster for the nation's airlines. Many
have gone belly-up (figuratively). The survivors have had to give
extraordinary discounts on fares to remain competitive.
   And while no one says so, it seems possible that preventive
maintenance and inspections of the commercial air fleet are being
skimped to save money.
   Even though the air industry vows that it's safer than ever, the
Bush administration and Congress should think seriously about
reimposing regulation, at least on maintenance, inspections and an
affordable plan for replacing the aging aircraft now in service.

   Los Angeles Times on Gorbachev's domestic troubles:
   The Soviet Union's new candor has prompted the public admission
that the government not only runs a budget deficit, but that it's a
whopper. ...
   Leonid I. Abalkin, director of the National Institute of the
Economy, says that this year's real deficit, including borrowing,
will exceed $160 billion. That's equivalent to 11 percent of the
gross national product, compared to a U.S. budget deficit that is
about 4 percent of GNP.
   The deficit, Abalkin says, ``ruins'' the economy. For President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev it also raises the most troubling political
questions.
   For one thing, Abalkin says, trying to reduce the deficit will
force deferring until at least the mid-1990s the major improvement
in living standards that Gorbachev has made a priority in his
program to restructure the economy.
   So far ... the Gorbachev era has seen a net decline in living
standards, with shortages of food and basic consumer goods
deepening. ...
   As part of the effort to cut the deficit, Abalkin says, about 20
percent of current capital investment in the civilian sector will be
slashed. The prospect, then, is for things to get worse before they
start to get better.

   The Sun, Baltimore, on Bush and star wars:
   George Bush has folded Ronald Reagan's star-wars umbrella. Reagan
unveiled his Strategic Defense Initiative speaking of space-based
weapons to ``intercept and destroy strategic ballistic weapons
before they reach our shore.''
   Bush signaled skepticism (by) naming Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who
denied the feasibility of a perfect defense, as his national
security adviser. Further, John Tower, Bush's choice to head the
Pentagon, said the administration considers it impossible to
``devise an umbrella that can protect the entire American population
from nuclear incineration.'' ...
   Two Reagan legacies destroy star wars. A deficit that will not
permit a $100 billion-plus SDI program and the pending
American-Soviet START treaty, a pact halving offensive arsenals,
which could founder over ballistic missile defense. To chop the
budget and get a START treaty, Bush must contain star wars. ...
   Bush is not being rushed into negotiations with Moscow. Nor is he
a prisoner of Reagan fantasies. He is counting on a comprehensive
strategic review as a basis for later decisions on weapons systems
and arms control positions. His watchwords should be flexibility,
realism and prudence.

   Read George's lips.
   Saying the fools, knaves and blunderers who have turned the
American savings and loan industry into the banking equivalent of
the Bangladesh economy is going to cost you money. Lots of money.
   (The) trial balloon _ charging everybody who's got money in an
account at a bank or S&amp;L one-quarter of a percent for ``insurance''
_ is not a tax because the president says it isn't. Good thing. If
it were a tax, it would be a remarkably unfair, regressive one.
   It's probably too chancey to re-regulate. Why not then go all the
way with deregulation?
   Instead of beefing up insurance, take it away. Let the market
handle its own abusers. Any stockholder, officer or depositor in
some lean-to Texas S&amp;L could be expected to know that the greater

   Quayle was president for only about three minutes. If he was
president, that is.
   There is a question because of the way the law on presidential
succession is worded.
   Ronald Reagan's term expired at noon Jan. 20. The Constitution
says that the vice president-elect takes over if ``a president shall
not have been chosen by the time fixed for the beginning of his
term.''
   George Bush was to be inaugurated at noon. But the ceremony ran
late. Some legalists contend that Quayle was president between noon
and the time Bush took the oath three minutes later.

mercifully short, that's what.

   Well, goodbye, Dali. It was surreal, man.
   Cheap puns, yes, but in contemplating the Spanish artist who died
(Jan. 23) at 84, the mind is tempted down that strange and twisted
path where the subconscious overtakes rational thought. ...
   Dali's ... dramatic version of modernism explored the
subterranean workings of human perception.
   He delved into dreams and raised to the surface, and onto canvas,
whatever he found. Like that special sleeping life of the night,
they could be lovely visions, or nightmares of abject terror. It all
lay in what we thought we saw _ or, alternatively, in what we did
not wish to remember beyond those first few moments after waking.
   To those who like their art plain and pretty, Dali and his whole
genre seem crazy. ...
   The critics may differ on Dali's rank among the greats, but there
is no question that he was one of the true originals of the 20th
century _ and that for possessors of an original Dali, partin' is a
sweet sorrow indeed.

<HEAD>Guardian Angels Threaten To Pull Out of Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guardian Angels leader Curtis Sliwa said today
local officials are preventing the organization from training its
British recruits.
   Sliwa accused London borough councils of ``giving in to political
pressure'' by refusing to let the Guardian Angels use their premises.
   He said attempts to train in public parks, including London's
Hyde Park, were frustrated by police who accused them of creating a
disturbance and ordered them to move.
   ``It is getting increasingly desperate,'' Sliwa said. ``How long
can we continue this nomadic existence without trainees becoming
depressed?''
   British police and some politicians oppose the New York-based
Guardian Angels coming to Britain, saying law enforcement should be
left to professionals.
   The government last week announced it will temporarily assign an
additional 80 police officers to patrol crime-plagued stretches of
the London subway.
   A legal briefing for Guardian Angel trainees had to be canceled
Tuesday night when one local council refused the group permission to
use a hall, Sliwa said.
   ``That was the icing on the cake. I haven't gotten mad up to now,
but this has made me angry,'' Sliwa said.
   ``I have had people tell me that they have had meetings in their
halls by people who advocate the overthrow of the government. We are
not a clandestine, subversive organization, but we cannot assemble,
we cannot train,'' he said.
   ``We have approached people who say they think it will be OK to
use their hall, but when they go to their boards they come back and
say, `Boy, those people don't want you anywhere.'''

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Banning Pesticide Regulating Apple Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
today the banning of a pesticide which regulates apple growth and
increases shelf life because of a link to cancer.
   The EPA, however, stopped short of ordering the chemical, which
is marketed under the trade name Alar, immediately off the market
because it said it does not consider the health risk severe enough
for such action.
   Apple growers during recent years have sharply curtailed use of
the pesticide, also known as daminozide, because of government
concerns that it may cause cancer. But according to EPA and industry
estimates, about 5 percent of the country's annual
200-million-bushel apple crop continues to be sprayed with the
chemical.
   The EPA, in action aimed at eventually banning the chemical, said
it will begin the formal rulemaking for such a ban within 90 days
and anticipates issuing a final regulation taking Alar off the
market within 18 months. Officials acknowledged, however, that the
process could take much longer if it is contested.
   John Moore, acting EPA administrator, told reporters there is
``an inescapable and direct correlation'' between exposure to Alar
``and the development of life-threatening (cancerous) tumors in test
mice.''
   Moore said laboratory tests are not expected to be completed for
another year but that preliminary results, although at times
conflicting, showed test animals having cancerous tumors when
exposed to Alar.
   The EPA estimated the chances of an adult getting cancer as a
result of Alar exposure from eating apples and apple products as 5
in 100,000 but it said the lifetime risk is higher for young
children because of their greater use of apple products.
   Moore acknowledged that the agency could seek an emergency
suspension that would order Alar off the market within months, but
he said the agency rejected such an action because of the continuing
conflicting test data, the fact that the tests have not been
completed, and because of the level of risk.
   He said that during the 18 months until a final ban is expected
the risk of an adult getting cancer as a result of Alar exposure is
at most 1 in a million and the risk for a child 9 in 1 million.
   ``We don't think that the added burden of risk (over the next 18
months) is of sufficient magnitude to warrant this kind of
(emergency) action,'' Moore told a news conference.
   Derl Derr, president of the International Apple Institute, which
represents 90 percent of the country's apple growers, said that the
growers have ``significantly'' reduced the use of Alar since 1986
when the EPA first seriously considered banning the chemical. He
said no more than 5 percent of the apples grown have the chemical,
which penetrates fruit, sprayed on them.

<HEAD>Contractor Decided Against Safety Device, Records Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials decided against installing a
remote-control gas detection system for a Milwaukee sewer project
weeks before an explosion killed three men checking methane levels
inside a tunnel, a newspaper reported.
   The Milwaukee Journal said Tuesday that a memo showed that
officials of the Program Management Office, which supervises
Milwaukee sewer construction, decided Sept. 16 not to order the
contractor to install the $12,257 system.
   The three men assigned to check the tunnel for methane died in an
explosion Nov. 10.
   The Program Management Office, a group of consulting firms, was
created to direct construction of a Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage
District $2.1 billion project that includes building huge tunnels
for holding sewage for treatment.
   The report said a Sept. 9 memo from PMO engineer Chuck Kennedy to
Barry Doyle, another PMO official, asked: ``Do you think we should
direct the contractor to proceed with installation of methane gas
recorder? We still have approximately 2,000 feet of tunneling
remaining. Please comment.''
   A handwritten, one-word answer _ ``No,'' along with the initials
B.D. and J.R. _ was returned to Kennedy on Sept. 16. The initials
are those of PMO officials Barry Doyle and John Ramage, the
newspaper reported.
   Philip Santacroce, a PMO official, said the contractor on the
project did not feel the safety system was necessary. Santacroce
said the mining would have been more than half completed by the time
the system could have been installed.
   ``The contractor felt he had enough monitoring equipment in the
hole, that he didn't need this recording device,'' Santacroce said.
``At the time, we felt, as long as (the contractor) felt he didn't
need it, we weren't going to go ahead and direct him to put it in.''
   But Santacroce stressed that the contractor, not the PMO or the
sewerage district, makes final decisions on how to build a project
and what safety equipment is necessary. ``We never told him he
shouldn't put it in,'' he said.
   The contractor, S.A. Healy Co. of McCook, Ill., has a $12 million
contract to build the 10-foot diameter sewer. Attorneys for the
company said Healy will not comment until local and federal
investigations are completed later this year.
   In September, Patrick Doig, Healy's project manager in Milwaukee,
wrote the PMO, requesting its advice on whether to install the
remote system.
   A sensor in the proposed system would have advanced with the
tunnel boring machine, transmitting continuous readings of methane
levels to an above-ground recorder, Doig said. ``We await your
direction,'' he wrote.
   An existing methane detector on the tunnel boring machine was
programmed to shut off the machine automatically when methane
accumulated to a certain level.
   Shutdowns occurred Nov. 7 and the day of the accident, Nov. 10,
when the detector found high levels of the combustible gas. Work was
halted and miners were evacuated.
   But because the sensor was not attached to a remote recorder,
workers carried hand-held methane detectors into the tunnel after
each evacuation to check gas levels.

   Vandals spray-painted obscenities and
racial slurs on two buildings and a fence at Abraham Lincoln's home,
officials said.
   The vandalism where Lincoln lived during his years in the
Legislature occurred late Monday or early Tuesday, police said.
Damage was estimated at $500.
   Pink and blue fluorescent paint was sprayed on the carriage
house, a shed and a white wooden fence. Meters and an air
conditioner also were damaged.
   Because the damage to the Lincoln Home National Historic Site
occurred on federal property, the FBI is investigating along with
police, said Larry Blake, acting site superintendent for the
National Park Service.
   Similar incidents of vandalism were reported over the weekend at
a condominium and an Illinois Bell Co. parking lot a few blocks from
the home, police said.
   The Lincoln home, the only house the 16th president ever owned,
was reopened last year after a year-long, $2.2 million renovation.
Lincoln bought the home in 1844.
   In 1987, Lincoln's Tomb, situated in Oak Ridge Cemetery several
miles from the home, was vandalized with spray paint. Five
teen-agers and an adult were convicted or pleaded guilty in the
vandalism and damage to nearby graves.

   Backers of Denver's ``living-in-sin'' law, which
has barred unmarried couples from living together in some
neighborhoods for more than 30 years, will have one more opportunity
to persuade the City Council to keep the rule.
   After hearing more than 80 residents argue over the zoning
ordinance, the council early Tuesday voted 8-4 to let unmarried
couples share single-family homes anywhere in the city. A final vote
will be held Feb. 27.
   ``I just do not think it's appropriate for the city to regulate
whether you are married any more than we should regulate whether you
go to church,'' said Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds, who has fought for
13 years to repeal the law.
   Councilman Dave Doering said, ``Zoning is to control particular
uses of a dwelling unit, not the personal relations of the people in
it.''
   But Councilman Ted Hackworth said the 1950s rule isn't
discriminatory because unmarried couples are allowed in many areas.
   ``We should stand up and say we stand for families and
traditional values,'' he said.
   Denver's law forbids unrelated adults from sharing a house in
about 8 percent of city neighborhoods, including some of the
wealthiest.
   Last year, 134 people were reported to be violating the
ordinance, said zoning administrator Dorothy Nepa.

   An Oklahoma construction company owner told
Congress today he paid thousands of dollars in bribes to Indian
housing officials in order to get multimillion-dollar contracts on
Shawnee and Chickasaw reservations.
   Kraig Kendall, president of K &amp; T Homes Inc., said he tried to
get housing contacts through straightforward competitive bidding but
was unsuccessful until he began buying gifts and giving cash to
housing authority officials and tribal chiefs.
   Kendall's testimony came on the third day of hearings before a
special panel of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs
investigating contract fraud and other alleged corruption on
reservations and among those doing business with Indians.
   ``Initially, I wined and dined them and gave them small presents
like turkeys and hams,'' Kendall said of his experience with
officials of the Shawnee housing authority.
   Later, he said, he offered the chairman of the authority tickets
to University of Oklahoma football games and was persuaded by him to
do the same for the chairman of the tribe.
   After sending the two to the Orange Bowl with about $500 in cash
and paid hotel reservations, Kendall said he received a contract for
a 50-unit housing project.
   Kendall described similar dealings with housing and tribal
officials of the Chickasaw nation, saying he paid $94,000 on phony
invoices from the tribal governor's construction supply
manufacturing company in order to get $14 million in contracts.
   Kendall said his way of doing business is standard procedure
among contractors working on Indian reservations.
   He also said that in order to participate in bidding for the
contracts he made an employee's wife who had an Indian relative in
her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company.
   ``She was a housewife,'' he said. He said she never participated
in company business except to sign papers when necessary.
   On Tuesday, Gevene Savala, a Kaibab Paiute Indian from Arizona,
told the panel she was made president and invested her life savings
in a road construction company run by her Mexican-American husband
who funneled his business to a larger non-Indian firm.
   Now her company, Savala Asphalt and Construction Enterprises
Inc., has lost the support of the backer, and she and her husband
are trying to recover her $90,000 and keep their company alive on
its own.
   Mrs. Savala's husband, David, did not appear before the
committee, but in an immunized statement read by his lawyer he said
he had been urged to go into business for himself by his boss at
Arizona Refining.
   Between 1983 and 1985, the company went from earnings of $800,000
to $10 million. But in 1986 the company's backer, Arizona Refining,
was sold and quit bonding Savala Asphalt and Construction
Enterprises, Inc.
   Mrs. Savala said her company's revenues plummeted to $1 million,
leaving the Savalas with big bills to pay.
   Her story was one of several told by witnesses before the
committee, which is investigating contract fraud and other alleged
corruption on reservations and among those doing business with
Indians.
   In his statement, Mrs. Savala's husband said: ``I had no
intentions of starting my own company, nor did I have the means to
do so. ...
   ``However, Mr. (James) Bagley guaranteed that if I created my own
business, my income would at least double, and promised that I would
not incur any losses.''
   Savala said Arizona Refining performed virtually all of the
functions of his company, including preparing bids for road projects.
   When contracts were awarded to Savala, Arizona Refining would be
the sole source of materials for the jobs, he said.
   ``I would appear on site to do exactly what I had been doing as
an employee of Arizona Refining _ drive a truck and lay the
petroleum products provided by Arizona Refining,'' Savala said.
   But when Arizona Refining quit guaranteeing his company through
its bonding, Savala had trouble getting contracts.
   He was forced to cut back, leaving him with high unemployment
taxes for laid-off employees and high insurance rates based on his
high-grossing years.
   In earlier testimony, Jefferson Begay, a Navajo Indian who owns a
construction company in Arizona, said most of his competitors for
Indian preference contracts are fronts.
   ``They give him (the Indian) a pickup truck and a salary and make
him Mr. President, bidding on Indian set-aside jobs,'' he said of
the relationship between the front companies and non-Indian backers.
   He said Indians go along with the process because it is extremely
difficult for them to get bonding on their own, and without that
guarantee from lending institutions, they don't get any business.
   Richard James Elroy, an FBI agent who has investigated Indian
contracting, said the problem of front companies is pervasive.
   He said they are not prosecuted because the law on Indian

   He said more specific legislation is needed to give prosecutors

   The first Gulf Air flight to Baghdad in
more than eight years took off from Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, marking
the resumption of flights halted by the Iran-Iraq war.
   The Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency said the airliner plans three
flights a week to the Iraqi capital from the United Arab Emirates'
capital of Abu Dhabi, Bahrain's capital, Manama, and Doha, capital
of Qatar.
   Gulf Air is owned by the governments of Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
Abu Dhabi, the biggest of the seven emirates of the United Arab
Emirates. They suspended flights to Baghdad shortly after the
outbreak of the war in September 1980.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted hostilities Aug. 20.
   Gulf Air flights to Tehran were suspended during the internal
strife following the Islamic revolution that overthrew the Iranian
monarchy in 1979.
   Airline sources said contacts are being made to resume flights to
Iran.

   Record-cold arctic air trapped over Alaska finally broke loose
and barreled into the lower 48 states, dropping a bitter winter into
the laps of springlike northern cities in a matter of minutes.
   Temperatures plunged by nearly 80 degrees in a day, with one town
reporting a 23-degree drop in one minute. High winds preceding the
cold front blew a toddler down a street in Lander, Wyo.
   The polar air outburst, accompanied today by blizzards driven by
winds over 100 mph, stunned residents of the northern Plains and
Midwest, where ski slopes and ice festivals had been abandoned for
golf courses and tennis courts.
   The frigid air, no longer trapped by a warm-air jet stream that
had strayed farther north than usual and left record-high
temperatures in 64 cities Tuesday, promised frigid weekend weather
for the East Coast and as far south as Arkansas, the National
Weather Service said.
   ``We're going to make up for the party we've been enjoying,''
said meteorologist Rick Brumer in Chicago.
   The party ended quickly on Tuesday, as arctic air rushed into the
balmy northern Plains, including Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming,
dropping temperatures to 10 to 20 below zero. High winds and blowing
snow knocked out power in Washington state _ Seattle got a rare
snowfall in the worst winter storm in more than three years _ and
parts of Montana.
   Valentine, Neb., reached a record high of 70 degrees and dropped
to zero degrees within 10 hours. The mercury plunged 33 degrees in
one hour after the cold front passed Valentine. In Russell, Kan.,
which had the national high temperature of 84 Tuesday afternoon, it
was 12 degrees this morning.
   In a 24-hour period beginning Monday morning, temperatures fell
79 degrees at Great Falls, Mont., from 62 above to 17 below zero.
The state braced for even colder weather today as the system
continued southward.
   ``It's the coldest air mass in the last five years, since
December of 1983,'' said Bruce Thoricht, a weather service
meteorologist at Billings.
   In the town of Cut Bank, about 100 miles north of Helena, a
Federal Aviation Administration official said the temperature
plunged 23 degrees in one minute, and 103 mph winds dropped the wind
chill to 75 below zero.
   ``It was a drastic drop, really fast,'' said Glacier County
Undersheriff Bill Barron.
   In Lander, winds gusting up to 86 mph dragged a 2-year-old boy
down the street, said his mother, Pamela Roberts, who chased after
him. The toddler was not seriously hurt.
   ``He fell and the wind dragged him along on his face,'' said
Roberts, 27. ``I was trying to hold him and trying to open the
door.''
   In the Plains, ranchers worked to secure cattle, particularly
newborn calves, in areas that basked in temperatures in the 60s
Tuesday but shivered in dangerous wind-chills down to 40 and 50
below this morning.
   ``It's a shock to anything's system, when you have a 100-degree
drop in temperature,'' said Tom Scott, executive director of the
Nebraska Beef Industry Development Board.
   In another way, the cold snap was good news for farmers who
suffered through drought last summer and faced more worries for the
coming season because of the dry winter.
   ``Given how dry it has been, it's better to have colder weather
because there's less chance of evaporation losses'' from the soil,
said Iowa state climatologist Harry Hillaker.
   Blizzards hit Tuesday in northwestern Minnesota, southeast North
Dakota and southern Montana. Cut Bank had 5 inches of snow and
Helena 4. Blowing, drifting snow dropped visibility to almost zero
in parts of Montana and Minnesota. Snowfall was light this morning
in most areas, but forecasters said more wind-whipped snow was
predicted in the upper Plains and Midwest tonight.
   The Minnesota state patrol closed a 50-mile stretch of highway in
the west-central part of the state for nearly 11 hours through this
morning, and troopers Tuesday night led about 100 stranded motorists
the 10 miles from Glyndon to Moorhead because Glyndon had no
accommodations for them.
   ``It was pretty treacherous going,'' said Dave Haug of West
Fargo, N.D., who drove the lead car in the convoy. ``I'm just glad I
got home.''
   Snow also fell in Washington state, where Snohomish and Spokane
got up to 5 inches.
   Two inches of snow were recorded in 24 hours at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport, enough to close the airport for nearly an
hour this morning. About 200 minor traffic accidents were reported
by early morning in the region, police said. It was Seattle's worst
winter weather since November 1985, when 17 inches of snow fell in
the month.
   Where snow didn't fall, high winds fanned a prairie fire in
Nebraska that consumed 8,000 acres and burned several farm buildings
but destroyed only one house.
   The cold air had been trapped over Alaska by a dome of extremely
high pressure. The barometer at Northway, Alaska, rose to a North
American record high of 31.85 inches of mercury, the weather service
reported Tuesday.
   The pressure was so high that the FAA late Tuesday restricted
flights over Alaska. Airplane instruments that use atmospheric
pressure to calculate altitude are not designed for such high
pressure and may give innacurate readings, officials said.
   Before the warm jet stream shifted south and freed the arctic
air, high-temperature records were broken or tied in 64 cities from
Colorado to Ohio and from northern Texas into southern Minnesota.
Dodge City, Kan., soared to 80 degrees, surpassing the record of 76
set in 1911; Chicago climbed to 65, breaking its 1877 record of 56;
Louisville, Ky., hit 67, also breaking a 112-year-old record;
Detroit climbed to 60, breaking the mark of 54 degrees set in 1890;
Grand Island, Neb., reached 72; and Fort Smith, Ark., hit 77.
   ``The upper air wind patterns are normally different than they
would be this time of year,'' said Brian Smith of the National
Weather Service Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``Normally we have the jet stream across the continental U.S.
It's been further north. ... Weather systems couldn't move through.''
   Finally, he said today, ``we've had a buckle in it.''
   Authorities reported no deaths or injuries directly attributable
to the cold. However, on Tuesday the body of a man whose skiff was
swamped by high seas and strong winds off the coast of southeast
Alaska was found on a beach.
   The warmth that preceded the cold front was indirectly
responsible for the death of a Wisconsin woman Tuesday aboard a sled
that sank in a lake where warnings had been issued several times
about untrustworthy ice.

   The judge in the Iran-Contra trial of Oliver L.
North said today he was considering a contempt-of-court citation
against an ABC News correspondent who presented excerpts of North's
immunized testimony to Congress on television Tuesday night.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell suggested the action
``appears to be a deliberate effort to obstruct'' the selection ``of
a jury in this case.''
   Gesell said that on the broadcast, ABC correspondent Tim O'Brien
``took pains'' to tell viewers that if they looked at his broadcast
of excerpts of testimony North gave Congress in 1987 under immunity,
they would not have to serve on the jury.
   Gesell said he has ``not made up my mind'' as to whether the
incident provides an ``appropriate basis for a contempt action.''
   O'Brien was not in the courtroom as Gesell spoke.
   ``I really am quite puzzled by it,'' ABC's Washington bureau
chief, George Watson, said of the judge's statement. ``Tim O'Brien
reported fairly and accurately what has been said in public, in
public testimony by Col. North. And last night we and other news
organizations reported that in explaining the case and how it came
to trial.''
   ``Our only deliberate effort is to accurately and fairly report
on the trial of Col. North,'' Watson said.
   The judge's comments underscored the difficulty of selecting a
jury at North's trial.
   Immediately after Gesell's comments, the judge disqualified a
woman who was employed at a Sears, Roebuck store in Washington from
being a potential juror in the North case because she worked in the
basement where dozens of TV sets were turned on when North was
testifying to Congress in July 1987.
   The woman said she ``heard something'' about North shredding
documents, but it was unclear from her answer whether she had
actually seen those references as North testified or heard news
accounts of it later.
   Defense attorney Brendan Sullivan said he shops at that
particular Sears store and that there are ``hundreds of TVs'' in the
basement where the woman works in the housewares department.
   Later in the morning, Gesell added four other people to the pool
of potential jurors, bringing the total to 11 of the 50 the judge
wants to have from which to choose.
   One was a postal clerk who said it would be a financial hardship
for her to serve on a jury because she was working part-time and
would not be paid while she was absent. Gesell said he might
intervene to make arrangements.
   A second was a laboratory technician. Gesell brushed aside
defense objections that the woman had seen North testifying to
Congress on TV, but she said she had not heard what he said.
   ``I have to take into account your client was on TV a great deal
under all kinds of circumstances,'' the judge told defense
attorneys. ``She did say she saw him, but she did not say she heard
him.''
   The third person chosen, an Army veteran of the Vietnam war, said
he could not recognize North, who sat across the courtroom.
   The fourth was a woman who has been a Pentagon mail clerk for the
past 16 years who said she had heard North was ``going to trial''
but ``didn't really pay attention'' to what the charges were. She
said she had been ``on vacation in Canada'' during the first part of
North's televised congressional testimony in 1987.
   Meanwhile, North's lawyers say any jury in the Iran-Contra case
should be kept in isolation for the entire time the fired White
House aide is on trial, which could be for five months.
   A request to sequester the jury was made by Sullivan on Tuesday,
the opening day of North's trial, as Gesell qualified seven people
to be part of a pool of potential jurors.
   Sullivan said that ``in the event a jury can be empaneled, it
should be sequestered immediately to minimize the potential for
exposure to immunized testimony and to protect Lt. Col. North's
constitutional rights.''
   At a Jan. 9 hearing, prosecutor John Keker estimated it would
take six to eight weeks to present evidence against North while
Sullivan estimated it would take two to three months to present the
defense's case.
   North faces 12 felony counts including lying to Congress in 1985
and 1986 to cover up Reagan administration assistance to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels during a period in which Congress had
banned U.S. aid to the insurgents.
   North's lawyers have said that no jury can be empaneled that
would provide him with a fair trial because the former National
Security Council aide later testified about his activities in
nationally televised hearings before Congress in 1987.
   In that testimony, North detailed many of his activities, such as
shredding documents and cashing travelers' checks intended for the
Contras, for which he is now accused of crimes.
   ``There has been repeated, widespread dissemination of Lt. Col.
North's immunized testimony for more than 18 months,'' said Sullivan.
   North appeared before Congress under a limited grant of immunity,
meaning the testimony itself could not be used to prosecute him.
However, under the arrangement, special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh
was allowed to gather much of the same information independently.
   Over protests from North attorney Barry Simon, Gesell on Tuesday
approved seven potential jurors out of an initial group of 54.
   One of the seven, a retired postal clerk, said she paid as much
attention to North's televised testimony as she paid to ``The Three
Stooges.'' She said her house had burned down and she was occupied
at the time with itemizing household items that had been lost.
   Another potential juror approved by Gesell has a son who delivers
newspapers for The Washington Post. Simon objected that the woman
must have seen headlines during North's testimony. But Gesell placed
her in the jury pool after being assured that she would cut off her
son's conversation if he ever starts talking about the North case.
   An unemployed man looking for work as a security guard also was
ordered into the jury pool. He said he saw North on television
during the congressional hearings but knew nothing about him.
   Simon objected to the selection, saying that ``if he heard even
one'' small portion of North's testimony, ``which he very easily
could have,'' he should be disqualified.
   In addition to charges that he lied to Congress, North is accused
of lying to the attorney general about his role in diverting
millions of dollars to the Contras from the Reagan administration's
secret weapons sales to Iran.
   He also is accused of ilegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
by using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the Contras.

   Moving 500 families into new apartments in the
city of Tangshan ended a 12-year effort to find housing for victims
of the most disastrous earthquake this century, an official report
said Wednesday.
   Xinhua state news agency quoted Mayor Chen Liyou as saying
reconstruction of the devastated northeastern city was completed
when the last families were transferred from temporary shelters. It
gave no date for the final move.
   The July 28, 1976, quake, measured 7.8 on the Richter scale and
killed 242,000 people. It destroyed 97 percent of buildings in the
city of 1 million.
   Chen said the government has spent $1.35 billion on constructions
since 1979.
   More than 200,000 apartments have replaced makeshift homes of
brick, broken tile and plastic sheeting that housed most city
residents for years after the quake.
   Xinhua quoted one man who was buried under rubble for six hours
as saying he feels safe because his new apartment has been built to
withstand quakes of up to 8.0 on the Richter scale.

<TEXT>
   A new survey on a controversial 50 percent pay
raise for members of Congress and top federal officials concluded
today that about 62 percent of the House would oppose the increase
if it came up for a vote.
   The survey, by groups opposed to the pay raise, was released as
House Speaker Jim Wright conducted his own questionnaire on the pay
issue that left open the possibility of a House vote.
   Wright, who had planned to allow the increase to become law Feb.
8 without a vote in the House, now says members can have a vote if
they express that view in the survey. But the speaker said he
expected members to tell him what they already communicated
privately: they want the raise without a vote, even if the Senate
defeats the pay hike as expected this week.
   The raise would become law Feb. 8 unless both houses vote to stop
it. Members of Congress would have their salaries increased from
$89,500 to $135,000.
   The new survey said 270 House members, or about 62 percent, said
they would oppose the raise if it came to a vote. Forty-seven, or
about 11 percent, said they would support the raise; 75 members,
about 17 percent, declined to state a position, and 41 members,
about 9 percent, declined to respond.
   Of those willing to take a position, 85 percent said they opposed
the raise, according to the survey, conducted by Public Citizen, a
consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader; the National
Taxpayers Union, a non-partisan organization of fiscal
consdrvatives; and Coalitions for America, a conservative
organization headed by activist Paul Wey;rich.
   ``A failure to vote on this issue would be a fundamental
breakdown of democracy,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen.
   Wright said Tuesday he ordered his survey to prove he is not a
dictator preventing a vote, but a leader who is following the
private wishes of members.
   While House members were sending their survey answers to Wright,
Senate opponents of the raise told the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee that the increase was too big, and that the system was
flawed by allowing it to become law without a vote.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said the system sets a bad example
for young Americans and commented, ``What must they think of us,
when we run from accountability, as cockroaches run from bright
light?''
   ``A pay raise without a timely vote in both houses is stealing,''
he said.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. said he was worried about Congress'
reputation because, ``People all over the United States are saying,
`They're a bunch of crooks'.''
   But committee member Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the raise was
needed, especially for judges and federal officials.
   ``What does it cost government to have incompetent people at the
top?'' Stevens asked.
   Tuesday, supporters of the pay plan urged that the increase at
least be approved for judges and top federal executives, even if
lawmakers are unwilling to raise their own salary.
   The raise will become law a week from today unless both houses
vote to stop it. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,
said senators will vote Thursday or Friday, and an Associated Press
Survey indicates at least 88 of them will oppose the raise.
   Should the raise become law, the House and Senate would each vote
immediately afterward on measures to bar outside income, including
speaking fees, according to congressional leaders.
   While opponents said they would try to have Congress rescind any
raise that became law, they would have a rough time convincing
colleagues to take such action once the speaking fees, known as
honoraria, are banned. Lawmakers would be reluctant to accept the
net loss of income if their raise and honoraria were taken away.
   House Democratic leadership sources, speaking only on condition
they not be named, said Wright acted on his own to order the survey,
with Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and Majority Whip Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., apparently cool to the idea.
   ``He (Wright) became the lightning rod'' for editorial writers
and voters who criticized a no-vote strategy, even though the tactic
had quiet, bipartisan support, said one leadership source. ``He's
been concerned about the misconception the speaker is preventing a
vocal majority of members from voting on something they want to vote
on.''
   In fact, Wright told reporters: ``Over the past several weeks, I
have heard from many members on both sides of the aisle. I have a
pretty good idea of how they feel. They support `regular
procedure,''' a term that means a lengthy process that would make it
impossible to vote by next Wednesday.
   But when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprise
him and demand one, Wright said, ``If the members want it, yes, of
course.''
   Coelho, who is directing bipartisan negotiations on a package of
outside income restrictions, said the talks are focusing on these
areas:
   _ Honoraria travel. Negotiators are looking at a time limit on
travel for members invited to speak, thus preventing somene from
receiving a week at a posh resort for making a single speech.
However, Coelho said there would be exceptions for multi-day events.
   _ When to end the ``grandfather'' loophole in campaign financing
law. The loophole has allowed 190 House members who were in office
as of Jan. 8, 1980, to stockpile more than $39 million in surplus
campaign money for their personal use. Coelho said there is
sentiment, although no agreement, to allow members to retire with
their cash at the end of their current term and then bar personal
use of the money starting in January 1991.
   _ Restriction on outside income other than honoraria. Probably
the toughest part of the proposal, negotiators are trying to decide
how to restrict attorneys' fees, book royalties and other earned
income. Coelho said it was possible that some forms of income, like
attorneys' fees, would be banned altogether while a percentage
limitation would be placed on outside earnings not under the ban.

   Villagers in southern Uganda are fleeing
into the bush to avoid contact with a medical team monitoring the
spread of AIDS and counseling victims of the killer disease, a
doctor said Wednesday.
   ``They think we are going to give them injections that will
eventually kill them, and that the injections would keep others
sexually impotent for the next nine years,'' said Dr. David
Sserwadda, leader of the team.
   AIDS is considered widespread in Rakai, the district 124 miles
south of Kampala.
   The team is working on a joint program by Kampala's Makerere
University and Columbia University in New York City to determine the
number of AIDS victims in the area.
   Robina Kasada, Rakai district administrator, has told the doctors
to be patient because it takes time for the people to accept new
ideas.
   Uganda has reported 6,000 AIDS cases, the highest number in any
African country. But the government is far more open than other
African governments, which are wary that high AIDS figures will harm
a lucrative tourist trade.

   A 10-year-old boy brought a loaded shotgun into
St. Joseph's Catholic School on Wednesday, but two teachers and a
custodian talked him into giving them the weapon, officials said.
   The child was being in juvenile detention at the county jail in
Emporia, Lyon County Sheriff Clifford Hacker said.
   Deputy Gary Sadowski said no shots were fired.
   ``The juvenile confronted two teachers and a custodian with the
shotgun,'' Sadowski said. ``During the confrontation, the two
teachers and the custodian were able to talk the juvenile into
surrendering the shotgun to them.''
   Sadowski said it appeared the incident was related to a problem
the boy had with another student. The other student was never
confronted, the deputy said.
   He said the sheriff's office sent four officers to the school, in
an east-central Kansas community of about 500 people, about 10 miles

<HEAD>Takeshita May Make New Proposal for Solving U.S.-Japan Trade Issues</HEAD>

   Japanese Prime Minister Noburo Takeshita may
bring to the United States a new proposal for handling U.S.-Japanese
trade disputes, the Bush administration said Wednesday.
   A senior administration official said exact contents of such a
plan were not known, but that the administration generally was
content with existing trade arrangements and laws.
   ``But that doesn't mean we're not willing to look at any new
suggestions the prime minister may bring with him,'' the official
said. ``And we certainly will do that.''
   The official briefed reporters at the White House on Takeshita's
upcoming visit under ground rules that his name not be used.
   Takeshita, the first foreign leader to meet with President Bush,
arrives Thursday for a two-day ``working visit.'' After leaving
Washington, he plans to visit Bush's predecessor, President Reagan,
in California.
   The administration official was asked about news reports in Japan
that Takeshita would bring along a new proposal for setting up a
U.S.-Japanese panel to oversee trade dispute between the world's two
largest economies.
   ``He may be. We don't have them (the proposals) as of now. We'll
see what he comes with. We have indications that he may have
something, but I don't know what it is.''
   However, the official said, ``We believe we do have a great many
mechanisms now that are working in the ways in which we negotiate
and discuss and try to settle the issues we have in the trade area.''
   The United States has special trade-dispute settlement agreements
with two nations: Israel and Canada.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is the world's largest trading
imbalance _ more than $50 billion annually for the past several
years.
   At Wednesday's briefing, the U.S. official said that ``given the
scale of our relationship, it's only natural that we have problems
and specific complaints that must be handled.''
   He said that while the trade shortfall with Japan had eased
slightly in recent months, ``it is still very enormous. And we still
have to work on it.''
   ``We have specific issues with Japan in terms of opening their
markets,'' the official said.

   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower today
denied allegations that he has a drinking problem, telling the
Senate Armed Services Committee he is a ``man of some discipline.''
   Conservative activist Paul Weyrich said Tuesday that he had ``on
a number of occasions'' seen Tower publicly inebriated and in the
company of women other than his wife.
   But in a closed committee session this morning, Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., said Tower denied that he was a womanizer, had
drinking problems or that past business ties with military
contractors would hamper his work.
   Tower later responded to the allegations in an open session.
Asked by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, if he has
drinking problem, the nominee replied: ``I have none. I'm a man of
some discipline.''
   Tower said it is ``essential that the secretary of defense be at
all times capable of exercising the duties of the office.''
   The nominee was also asked whether he would tolerate
discrimination or sexual harassment of women in the Defense
Department. He replied that he would have ``zero tolerance'' for
such practices and that ``professional women would be afforded the
respect and deference they deserve.''
   He added that he does not envision seeing women in a combat role.
   Nunn said at the conclusion of the hearings that the committee
would vote on the nomination on Thursday.
   Nunn began the open session by reading a letter from C. Boyden
Gray, the counsel who handled President Bush's transition, in which
Gray denied that the office received letters ``containing specific
allegations of impropriety concerning Senator Tower.''
   Weyrich had testified that the office received letters
questioning Tower's moral character but they had not been brought to
the attention of the Armed Services Committee or Bush.
   At the start of this morning's closed session, Tower was allowed
to respond to Weyrich's allegations, Wallop said.
   Tower ``said that he does not feel that he has problems, as have
been characterized by people upstairs (in open session) and
personally feels himself to be a strongly disciplined man,'' he
continued.
   ``I don't know of anybody who suspected that he did have a
drinking problem. He stated his viewpoint that he did not,'' said
Wallop. ``I think everybody in there is quite satisfied about his
lifestyle.''
   Nunn expressed chagrin Tuesday after Weyrich testified that ``on
a number of occasions'' he had seen Tower publicly drunk and in the
company of women other than his wife. Tower has been divorced twice.
   In other confirmation proceedings Tuesday, the Senate approved
the nomination of Robert Mosbacher as Commerce secretary, Samuel
Skinner as Transportation secretary and Carla Hills as special trade
representative. The vote was 100-0 on all three nominations.
   Also Tuesday, the White House asked for a rare delay in
confirmation hearings for Louis Sullivan to be health and human
services secretary, and said it had nothing to do with the flap over
the nominee's views on abortion.
   Tower said last week in two days of testimony that he received
fees of more than $1 million for consulting work for seven defense
contractors, including such industry giants as Rockwell and
Martin-Marietta.
   The committee has been expected to approve Tower to head the
Defense Department, and there was no immediate indication that
Weyrich's remarks would change that.
   Tower, a 63-year-old Texas Republican, served 24 years in the
Senate, and was chairman of the Armed Services Committee from
1981-85.
   Members emerging from Tuesday's closed session sounded
unimpressed with the testimony from Weyrich and another witness,
William Jackson Jr.
   Jackson, a senior fellow at the Fulbright Institute of
International Relations, said he had heard rumors about Tower's
personal life from delegations traveling to Geneva.
   ``A number of allegations prove to be wrong,'' said Nunn, who
added that the committee is ``continuing to pursue all allegations.''
   Tower refused to comment as he left the committee's offices.
   Tower was not present when Weyrich took the witness chair and
uttered in public the allegations that had been the subject of
rumors for several weeks while President Bush was deciding on a
candidate to head the Pentagon.
   ``Over many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition
lacking sobriety as well as with women to whom he was not married; I
recognize senators' wives because I worked here in the Senate for
many years,'' Weyrich said. ``I did encounter this on a number of
occasions.''
   Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before
his nomination was announced. In divorce papers filed by his second
wife, Lilla Burt Cummings, Tower was accused of ``marital
misconduct.''
   Bush has defended Tower, saying an FBI background check found
nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary.
When he announced the nomination he dismissed ``a lot of rumors that
proved to be groundless.''
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats joined in
praising the three Bush administration appointments they approved
Tuesday.
   Mosbacher is a longtime friend of Bush's who raised millions of
dollars for the Republicans in last year's campaign.
   Ms. Hills was the secretary of Housing and Urban Development
during the Ford administration during the mid-1970s, and has
practiced law in Washington since.
   Skinner was the chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority
of Northeastern Illinois, which includes the mass transit system
serving Chicago. He is also a political ally of Illinois Gov. James
Thompson and served as a campaign aide in Bush's bid for the White
House.
   Discussing the request to delay the Sullivan hearing, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration has asked for
more time for more background checks.
   Sullivan upset anti-abortion leaders twice in recent weeks when
remarks attributed to him indicated he was not an adamant foe of
abortion.

   Here is a list of responses by House members to
a survey conducted Jan. 13-31 by groups opposed to the proposed pay
raise.
   The survey was conducted by Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy
group founded by Ralph Nader; the National Taxpayers Union, a
non-partisan organization of fiscal conservatives; and Coalitions
for America, a conservative organization headed by activist Paul
Weyrich.
   The 50 percent pay raise for members of Congress and top federal
officials becomes law Feb. 8 unless both houses of Congress vote to
stop it.
   The survey question was: If President Reagan's proposed 50
percent pay raise comes up for a vote, how would the representative
vote?
   A ``yes'' vote is shown here as Y.
   A ``no'' vote is shown as N.
   A ``no response'' is shown as NR.
   Undecided is shown as U.
   There are two vacancies in the 435-member House.

<HEAD>Bush Nominates Appeals Court Judge Starr as Solicitor General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday he will nominate
conservative federal appeals judge Kenneth W. Starr to be solicitor
general, the government's chief representative before the Supreme
Court.
   Starr's willingness to give up his lifetime appointment on the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was seen
in legal circles as a good way to put himself in the running for a
future nomination to the Supreme Court.
   Following a similar route, Thurgood Marshall gave up a federal
judgeship to become solicitor general in 1965, and two years later
he was named by Lyndon B. Johnson to the high court.
   At 42, Starr is regarded by many courthouse observers as too
young to want to spend the rest of his career on the D.C. Circuit.
However, there may be political risks in the solicitor's job if
Starr eventually wants to go to the high court.
   As solicitor general, Starr likely would be the person to urge
the high court to overturn its 1973 abortion-rights decision _ a
position that could elicit strong opposition from pro-abortion
forces if he is later nominated as a justice.
   Starr was a clerk for former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and
later a partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp;
Crutcher. He served as counselor to then-Attorney General William
French Smith from 1981 until his appointment to the D.C. appeals
court in 1983.
   The solicitor general is the government's chief appeals lawyer,
arguing cases before the Supreme Court and deciding whether to
appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Starr would succeed Charles Fried,
who resigned to return to Harvard University Law School.

<HEAD>Sudanese Rebel Leader Meets U.S. Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sudanese rebel leader met with State
Department officials recently as part of a U.S. effort to end
Sudan's civil war that has left millions in danger of starvation,
officials said Wednesday.
   Mansour Khalid, who serves as the foreign envoy of the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army, arrived in Washington last week and asked
to meet with representatives of President Bush's new administration,
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   Khalid spoke on the telephone with officials of the National
Security Council, said White House officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity. He also met with Julia Taft, who heads the U.S.
government's Foreign Disaster Assistance program and has been
pressing both sides to allow relief convoys safe passage from Kenya
into famine areas, said a State Department official, also speaking
only on condition he not be named.
   Redman said that Khalid has been here before and that his
meetings did not reflect a change in U.S. policy. Khalid has said he
knows Bush from the days both represented their governments at the
United Nations in 1971 and 1972.
   Until recently, the U.S. government had carefully avoided taking
sides in Sudan, angering congressional critics who charged that the
State Department was allowing foreign policy considerations to
overrule humanitarian needs. Congressional delegations to Sudan in
recent weeks have been told that as many as 500,000 Sudanese died
last year of hunger.
   In recent months U.S. officials have been taking a slightly more
critical approach toward the Sudanese government of Sadiq Mahdi
after he refused to support a tentative cease-fire pact signed by
one party in his coalition government. Mahdi has been pressured by
Moslem fundamentalists in his government to reject any pact with the
predominantly Christian and animist rebels.
   The United States has been urging the Ethiopian-backed SPLA and
the government of Mahdi to negotiate an end to their five-year war
and to allow foreign relief supplies to reach starving Sudanese in
the southern part of the country.
   The Sudanese government has supported past U.S. discussions with
the rebel group and was informed of the meetings with Khalid, said
one U.S. official. He said the two sides in Sudan are also talking
with each other.
   In an effort to bring pressure on Mahdi, U.S. diplomats in
Ethiopia have been talking more frequently to SPLA representatives,
and the United States has also been urging the Soviet Union to get
involved in efforts to end the war.
   The United States enjoyed military basing rights and close ties
with the Sudanese government of Gaafar Nimeiri, but relations with
Sudan deteriorated after he was deposed in a 1985 coup.

   Striking teachers kept more than 1.5
million students out of schools and universities throughout the
country Wednesday, bringing education in Greece to a standstill for
a second time this year.
   About 6,000 private school educators also walked off the job to
protest a proposed law they say will abolish private education in
Greece.
   In downtown Athens, about 2,000 government-employed teachers
staged a protest march pressing demands for a 16 percent pay
increase and more government spending on education.
   Union officials said teachers would stop striking Friday.
   Their actions stopped midyear exams for 100,000 students in the
17 state-run universities.
   University professors are demanding a 50 percent increase on
salaries averaging $566 a month, which they claim have devalued 50
percent since the socialists won power in 1981.
   The action came amid growing concern by parents and private
school administrators who have threatened to close their schools if
the government passes a law strengthening its control of finances,
management and running of private schools.
   More than 100,000 pupils attend 486 private shools around Greece.

   A worksheet of calculations by Admiral
Robert E. Peary provides no evidence he faked his claim of reaching
the North Pole in 1909 but doesn't end the debate on whether he
actually reached his destination, the head of a foundation hired by
The National Geographic Society announced today.
   Retired Rear Adm. Thomas D. Davies, president of The Navigation
Foundation, presented a new interpretation of a single sheet of
Peary's handwritten navigational notes.
   Baltimore astronomer and historian Dennis Rawlins, in a 1970
article and a 1973 book, had argued that Peary faked his claim to
have discovered the pole. Most recently, in October, he cited the
worksheet as further evidence of fraud.
   Davies said, ``The piece of paper provides no evidence Peary
faked his claim.''
   But he added, ``This worksheet says absolutely nothing about
whether Peary reached the pole.'' He said debate about Peary will
continue as the foundation reviews other pieces of data from the
expedition in its investigation.
   Davies said three experts _ evaluating the single document only _
found the calculations are not from 1909, as believed from the
envelope in which they were found, but from an earlier polar
expedition made in 1906.
   He said Rawlins' ``sensational claims'' are not proved by the
calculations.
   Further, Davies said that one set of numbers that Rawlins
interpreted as compass readings taken as part of celestial
observations were actually serial numbers found on the face of a
chronometer taken on the polar expedition.
   Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic
Society, attacked Rawlins' claim that Peary deliberately faked his
results.
   ``Suggesting Peary might not have reached the pole is one thing;
declaring him a fraud is another,'' Grosvenor said.
   Grosvenor said that in commissioning Davies and the foundation to
carry out the study, ``I told him, let the chips fall where they
may.''
   National Geographic previously asked Wally Herbert, a British
polar explorer to investigate Peary's claims. Herbert published an
article last year saying he found that Peary was 30 to 60 nautical
miles off course.
   Rawlins earlier had found Peary came no closer than 121 miles but
because of difficult conditions and low supplies felt pressured to
say he had discovered the North Pole.

   UNICEF appealed Wednesday for $11.5 million in
emergency aid for hundreds of thousands of Sudanese forced to flee
their homes by drought and civil war.
   The main aim is to help provide food, drugs and clean water for
displaced people in war-torn southern Sudan and around the capital,
Khartoum, according to the U.N. Children's fund.
   Vaccination drives are planned, since a measles outbreak killed
all children under five in some villages last year, said Robert
Rogier, a UNICEF representative in Sudan.
   A third of Sudan's children are malnourished, and every 10th baby
dies before its first birthday, said UNICEF.
   Up to 1 million southern Sudanese have migrated north to Khartoum
in the past 18 months, fleeing the worst drought in years and war
between troops of the Moslem-dominated government and rebels from
the minority Christians and animists of the south.
   Heavy rain and floods in August left another 1 million people
homeless in Khartoum, UNICEF said.

<HEAD>Plan to Appoint Sharansky as Ambassador Gets Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers on Wednesday criticized the
nomination of Natan Sharansky as Israel's next U.N. ambassador,
saying the appointment of the human rights activist and former
Soviet prisoner could hurt relations with Moscow.
   Senior Israeli officials, who announced Sharansky's candidacy
Tuesday, expressed hope that Sharansky's popularity would help boost
Israel's image, which has suffered during the 13-month Palestinian
uprising.
   But leading Israeli newspapers said Sharansky is not the right
man for the job.
   They cited Sharansky's lack of experience in Israel and said the
appointment of a man convicted of anti-Soviet espionage would offend
Moscow, which only recently began to improve ties with Israel after
a 20-year diplomatic break.
   The appointment of Sharansky, 41, would have to be approved by
Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the left-leaning Labor Party,
and by the coalition Cabinet.
   Two Israeli newspapers quoted unidentified State Department
officials as warning against derailing efforts to restore ties with
Moscow by giving Sharansky such a high-ranking diplomatic post.
   Sharansky ``has barely managed to become rooted in the country's
landscape and hasn't yet found his proper place in Israeli
society,'' said the mass-circulation daily Yediot Ahronot.
   The appointment ``is liable to be interpreted as a superfluous
provocation of the Soviet Union,'' the newspaper said.
   Other criticism focused on Sharansky's personality, with the
daily Maariv saying the appointment could prove risky because
``Sharansky will not settle for serving as a mouthpiece ... He is an
individualist whose opinions cannot always be foreseen.''
   The paper apparently was referring to Sharansky's somewhat
independent stand on the Palestinian problem, including his meetings
with pro-PLO figures in the occupied lands.
   A popular columnist for the Haaretz daily compared the Sharansky
designation to appointing Jewish spy Jonathan Pollard ambassador to
Washington if he were freed from jail. Pollard, a former U.S. Navy
analyst, is serving a life sentence on treason charges for selling
classified information to Israel.
   The daily Hadashot and Maariv quoted a Soviet U.N. official
identified as Alexander Dinisov as saying Sharansky's appointment
``will not cause any friction between Israel and the Soviet Union.''
   In Moscow, the deputy head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's press
center, Vadim Perfilyev, said the issue is a matter of Israel's
internal affairs.
   Sharansky, the symbol of the Soviet Jewry emigration struggle,
came to Israel in 1986 after an East-West prisoner exchange that
freed him from jail in the Soviet Union, where he served nine years
on espionage charges. Western observers believe the espionage charge
was in fact punishment for his political views.
   Sharansky dodged reporters' questions Wednesday. Asked about the
reported appointment, he said ``No comment, no comment'' as he left
a Jerusalem hotel after addressing North American rabbis.
   After the speech, one of the rabbis addressed Sharansky as ``Mr.
Ambassador.'' Sharansky smiled and said: ``I'm glad you accept that
I'm the ambassador of Soviet Jews here in Israel.''

   The son of civil rights leader James H.
Meredith has pleaded no contest to charges of manslaughter and
drunken driving in a 1987 car accident that killed two people.
   In a plea bargain arrangement with prosecutors, James H. Meredith
Jr. changed his plea from innocent on Tuesday, the second day of his
jury trial in York County Superior Court.
   The terms of the agreement called for a one-year prison sentence,
but sentencing was delayed to review a request by Meredith's
attorney for house arrest, rather than jail.
   Meredith, 22, could have faced up to 10 years in prison if
convicted of manslaughter.
   Meredith and two friends were returning from dinner in Saugus,
Mass., on Aug. 26, 1987, when his sports car missed a curve and
struck a boulder. Meredith suffered multiple injuries but recovered.
Paul Huard, 44, and Kevin Jones, 26, were killed.
   The three had lived together while working summer jobs at an
Ogunquit restaurant.
   At the time of the accident, Meredith's blood-alcohol level was
0.11, just above the then-legal intoxication limit of 0.10. The
limit has since been reduced to 0.08.
   Currently a junior business major at the University of
Pennsylvania, Meredith is free on $5,000 bond pending sentencing.
His father, James Meredith Sr., was the first black to gain entrance
to the University of Mississippi in 1962, and went on to lead the
1966 March Against Fear across Mississippi. He is now a businessman
in Cincinnati.

   A military judge today convicted a
Marine platoon sergeant of negligence in the death of a soldier who
had been left behind in the Mojave Desert during a training exercise
in August.
   The judge, Maj. Kent Smith, ruled that Sgt. Christopher Clyde
failed to properly account for the whereabouts and welfare of his
Marines.
   Clyde was the platoon sergeant of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, 19, of
Minneapolis, Minn., who was left behind during a night exercise Aug.
30 after being posted as a road guide in the California desert. His
remains were found in December.
   The sergeant was found innocent of willful disobedience. He had
been accused of failing to obey orders in granting leave to Rother's
squad leader after the exercise, resulting in a delay in realizing
Rother had been left behind.
   Clyde has maintained he did nothing wrong and that he only relied
on the instructions of his superiors. ``If he's guilty of anything,
he's guilty of relying on other people,'' defense attorney William
Fisher said in closing arguments.
   Prosecutor Robert Nunally had argued, ``He screwed up and he
screwed up in a major way.''
   On Tuesday, the defense and prosecution reached an agreement that
eliminated the need for Sgt. Thomas B. Turnell, Rother's squad
leader, to testify. Turnell also faces a court-martial in the case.
   Under the agreement, a statement was submitted in which Turnell
agreed that he told Clyde his men were all present or accounted for,
leading Clyde to believe that included Rother.
   The defense had sought a grant of immunity to get Turnell to
testify; the prosecution opposed immunity.
   Rother was left behind by a truck assigned to pick up road guides
posted in the desert at Twentynine Palms, Calif.

<HEAD>Security Increased At U.S. Facilities In Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police increased security around U.S.
facilities Wednesday after student radicals vowed a new wave of
demonstrations the week President Bush arrives on an official visit.
   The government warned it won't tolerate further acts of violence
against U.S. and other foreign facilities.
   National Police Headquarters ordered its units to deploy more
police around 13 U.S. facilities in Seoul and other major cities and
to increase street checks on pedestrians.
   In the most recent attack on Tuesday, 50 radical students,
shouting ``Yankee go home!'' hurled dozens of firebombs at the U.S.
cultural center in the opposition stronghold of Kwangju. Nobody was
hurt.
   The center in southern Korea has been attacked 26 times since
1981, including six times in 1988 alone.
   ``Security was increased within a radius of 100 yards from all
concerned U.S. facilities and more martial arts-trained plainclothes
men were desployed,'' one police official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   In a special statement Wednesday, the government regretted
repeated attacks by radical students on a U.S. cultural center and
warned that further violence would not be tolerated. ``The use of
physical violence against a foreign facility can in no way be
justified,'' said the statement issued by Culture and Information
Minister Choe Byung-yul, the government's chief spokesman.
   The National Council of Student Representatives, a nationwide
radical group, defied the government warning and said it would start
a major protest campaign Feb. 25, the first anniversary of President
Roh Tae-woo's government and one day before a visit by Bush.
   Bush has said he will visit Seoul Feb. 26 after stopping in
Beijing and attending the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito in
Tokyo.
   The government statement came amid growing public concern about
escalating anti-Americanism in South Korea, where 40,000 American
troops are stationed.
   Anti-Americanism has been fanned by disclosures of corruption and
human rights abuses under the U.S.-backed government of former
President Chun Doo-hwan. Many opposition and dissidents claim the
United States was involved in the military suppression of a 1980
civil uprising in Kwangju, in which 200 people were killed. They
also claim that the Kwangju incident was instigated by Chun, then an
army general, as part of his efforts to seize power.
   Opposition parties and major newspapers joined the government in
denouncing the recent attacks on the Kwangju center. Two leading
Korean-language newspapers ran editorials under the headline ``No
Firebombs.''
   ``The government is convinced that such acts of violence clearly
run counter to the wish of the Korean people as a whole,'' said the
government statement. ``The students should exercise self restraint
to prevent such incideents in order not to damage traditional
Korea-U.S. friendship.''
   The Party for Peace and Democracy, the largest political
opposition, issued a statement regretting the attack and asking the
redical students, who lack broad public support, to avoid violence.
   ``We fully understand that the students want to address the past
wrongdoing, but the matter should be peaceful and rational,'' it
said.

   A man who repeatedly called a woman after
raping her and said he would give her an air conditioner as an
apology was arrested after his phone messages provided leads to his
identity, police said.
   Steven R. Bunner, 22, of Omaha, was sentenced Tuesday to 20 to 30
years in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of first-degree
sexual assault.
   Detective Michael Hoch on Wednesday gave this account of the
incident:
   The victim, a 21-year-old nursing student, said she was awakened
in her bed July 17 by a man sexually assaulting her. Afraid she
would be hurt, she tried to befriend the man, who asked for her name
and telephone number. She gave him both.
   The man apologized and asked the woman what he could do to make
amends. She said she needed an air-conditioner; he said he would get
her one and left.
   The next day the woman returned to her apartment with a police
officer. On her answering machine they found two messages that she
said had a voice matching the rapist's.
   In one message, the man said he was ``Steve'' and was calling to
arrange delivery of the air-conditioner.
   The man phoned the victim later and spoke with her in person, and
she obtained enough information for police to search Bunner's
apartment and arrest him the next day, Hoch said. A used air
conditioner that was not hooked up was found in the apartment, the
officer said.
   Bunner confessed to the rape after being confronted with the
answering-machine tape, said Hoch. He later confessed to assaulting
another woman in 1987. Under Tuesday's sentence Bunner will be
eligible for parole in 13 years.

<HEAD>DOE Promises Five-Year Cleanup of Buried Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK WARBIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Energy today agreed to
pay for an accelerated, $456 million cleanup of buried nuclear waste
at its Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Gov. Cecil Andrus
announced today.
   The agreement came more than three months after the governor
closed Idaho's borders to temporary storage of nuclear waste.
   At a news conference, Andrus said negotiations with DOE since the
Oct. 19 ban led to the commitment to the 5{-year cleanup. Before the
talks began, the department planned to spend only $29.6 million
through fiscal year 1991.
   ``This is a tremendous step forward in the effort to completely
remove years of accumulated buried waste,'' Andrus said. ``The
department's commitment of significant new resources indicates that
DOE understands how important cleanup is to Idaho and to the
nation.''
   However, the governor said he will not reconsider his ban on
waste shipments until legislation is introduced in Congress to begin
the land withdrawal process necessary to open the DOE's permanent
storage site near Carlsbad, N.M.
   ``Until that time, the borders remain closed,'' Andrus said.
   About 2 million cubic feet of transuranic, low-level radioactive
and other hazardous wastes buried beneath the laboratory, some of it
since the 1950s.
   Some cleanup work has been under way since 1987 when tests found
contamination in the aquifer under the site.
   Andrus said today's announcement means the cleanup will be
sharply accelerated.
   The DOE has agreed to spend $33.9 million on cleanup in the
current fiscal year, through Sept. 30; $62 million in fiscal 1990,
and $89.9 million over each of the following four years. The money
is subject to congressional approval.
   The faster cleanup and increased funding, along with DOE's
agreement to conduct an epidemiology study around the lab and its
initiation of land withdrawal action on the plant in New Mexico,
means three of Andrus' four conditions for reassessing his ban on
waste shipments have been met.
   The governor, who previously blasted DOE for failing to keep
repeated promises to clean up the laboratory, said he was confident
he could trust the department to follow through on its latest
commitment.
   ``There are plenty of opportunities for the state of Idaho to see
the DOE keeps its word this time,'' Andrus said, mentioning some
unspecified ``cards that have not been played yet.''
   Laboratory manager Don Ofte said research is under way to find
the safest and most effective ways to get to the buried waste. But
he said it may be two or three years before the first shipments
begin leaving the site.

   A woman was charged Wednesday with
murder in the dehydration death of her 6-month-old daughter,
authorities say was left alone for a week while the mother went on
vacation.
   Peggy Ann Barsness, 22, of Burnsville was charged in Dakota
County District Court with one count each of second- and
third-degree murder in the death of Kirsten Barsness, said County
Attorney James Backstrom. District Judge Robert Carolan set bail at
$200,000.
   An autopsy completed Tuesday found that the baby died from
dehydration. Authorities said the girl may have been dead several
days before she was found in her crib.
   Barsness reported the death to police Monday, saying she had
found the child dead earlier that morning after returning from
visiting a boyfriend in California. She said she had arranged for a
baby sitter, but was unable to provide the person's last name, phone
number or address, police Lt. Fred Rau said Tuesday.
   ``We've been able to find no information that she made any
arrangements to have the baby cared for while it was home alone,''
Rau said.

   Videotapes of serial killer Ted Bundy's
interview the day before his execution will be offered to the
public, the interviewer said.
   James Dobson said the 29-minute tape would be sold for a
``suggested donation'' under $30. He will feature the interview
Thursday and Friday on his radio program, heard on more than 1,000
stations around the country.
   Paul Hetrick, a vice president for Dobson's Focus on the Family
organization, said a person who asked for a videotape without
enclosing money may or may not get a copy. Because of Internal
Revenue Service Regulations, the California-based ministry can't
sell the tape.
   Bundy told Dobson during the Jan. 23 interview that exposure to
pornography helped fuel his sexual urges to a point that he looked
for satisfaction by mutilating, killing and raping women.
   ``We'll probably put the videotape in the hands of people with
anti-pornography groups,'' Hetrick said. ``We'll meet whatever
demand is there.''
   Bundy confessed to the murders of 23 women in the days shortly
before he was executed for the 1978 murder of 12-year-old Kimberly
Leach of Lake City. Investigators have said he may have killed as
many as 100 people.

   Moslem guerrillas pounded a convoy of
Soviet trucks and tanks with artillery fire on Wednesday as it
headed toward the border in the final phase of the Red Army
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Rebels also fired three rockets into the capital, but there were
no reports of injuries or deaths, government officials said.
   The government also said the army opened fire to stop a fight
that broke out Tuesday when several people tried to cut into a long
line at a gasoline station. Officials said two people were killed
and three injured, but witnesses said at least eight pople died and
35 were injured.
   In Kandahar, the nation's second-largest city, 400 Afghan troops
defected to the insurgents during rebel assaults over the weekend
and two helicopter gunships were destroyed at the military airport,
rebels said Wednesday in Pakistan.
   According to an Interior Ministry spokesman in Kabul, a Soviet
convoy pulled out of the Afghan capital on Wednesday and headed up
the Salang Highway, the only route leading to the Soviet border.
   The spokesman, who identified himself only as Hamad, said tanks
and trucks carrying from 10 to 50 soldiers each moved through a
checkpoint about two miles north of Kabul about 6 a.m.
   He said the soldiers seemed happy to be on their way home. ``They
were smiling and they were smiling and waving,'' the spokesman said.
   About two miles farther north, Moslem rebels fighting to oust the
Soviet-backed government of President Najib bombarded the convoy
with rockets.
   Because of the shelling, Afghan soldiers refused to allow anyone
past the checkpoint without permission from the Interior Ministry.
   The mountainous, 260-mile road has been the scene of heavy
fighting between Soviet and Afghan forces and the U.S.-supported
rebels based in Pakistan.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement signed in April, the 115,000
Soviet troops sent into Afghanistan to prop up the Marixst
government in late 1979 are to be gone by Feb. 15. Western and
Soviet diplomats estimate that only 15,000 Red Army soldiers remain
in Afghanistan.
   As the withdrawal deadline approached, Soviet soldiers turned
over outposts along the perimeter road around Kabul to the Afghan
forces.
   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, the commander of the Soviet troops in
Afghanistan, said Tuesday he is confident the Afghans can hold onto
the Salang Highway and the key mountain pass that has been the scene
of heavy fighting.
   The Soviets have assured the Afghan government they will continue
to provide military assistance to Afghanistan after the last Soviet
soldiers return home. But the Soviets have not said when that
assistance will arrive.
   An estimted 1,000 flatbed trucks carrying rocket launchers,
ammunition and small missiles move along the highway every day,
Afghan officers stationed along the road have said.
   The Soviets also use the highway to carry flour, eggs, kerosene,
fuel and other supplies to the capital, where food and fuel
shortages have been reported in recent weeks, partly due to rebel
attacks on convoys moving on the highway.
   The emergency shipments have helped ease the long lines that
formed outside bread shacks. Most lines have disappeared or become
noticeably shorter.
   Local officias say they have at least a three-month reserve, but
one U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday there was only enough
to last a few days.
   Several diplomats and relief workers, however, dismissed the
claim.
   ``Washington is either very pessimistic or they think we really
eat a lot,'' said one U.N. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. However, long lines still form outside the gasoline
stations and stretch for blocks.
   It was unclear how long the Soviet tranport will continue to
Kabul, where refugees from the war have more than doubled the
population to 2 million.
   Packed buses, many with people riding on top with their thin,
ragged shawls flapping in the cold wind, arrive in the capital daily.
   Rockets are periodically fired into the capital. Two car bombs
exploded this week, and two suitcase bombs were found and defused at
the airport. Several missiles also have been fired at the airport
and at departing planes.
   The Afghan soldiers who defected in southeastern Kandahar
surrendered large quantities of arms and ammunition, according to
Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for the Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla
group.
   Saeed, who runs the rebel Afghan News Agency, said guerrillas
launched combined assaults on Kandahar airport on Saturday,
``inflicting untold losses on the puppet troops'' and destroying two
helicopter gunships. The news agency said the insurgents attacked
security posts around Kandahar province Sunday and captured weapons,
rockets and military trucks.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, arriving in
Latin America for the Bush Administration's first overseas mission,
said today that any effort by the Latin countries to form a
``debtors' cartel'' would be strongly resisted by the United States.
   Quayle, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Two just before
landing in Caracas, said the idea being considered by some Latin
leaders to develop a united front to deal with their common debt
crisis is ``counterproductive.''
   ``We are absolutely opposed to the idea of a debtors' cartel,''
Quayle said. ``Our strong position is that a debtors' cartel is a
non-starter'' because each country has different circumstances that
should be addressed on an individual basis.
   Quayle made the comments as he flew here to attend the
inauguration Thursday of Venezuela's new president, Carlos Andres
Perez.
   Upon his arrival, Quayle caused a horn-honking stir at a busy
intersection when he stopped his motorcade for an impromptu shopping
trip at a small corner fruit market.
   Quayle ate a banana and sampled a guava and handed out pins
bearing the U.S. and Venezuelan flags.
   With some two dozen heads of state expected at the inauguration,
the Third World debt drisis is expected to be a major topic of
discussion among the leaders and when they meet with Quayle in
bilateral talks.
   Today, Quayle's packed schedule included meetings with Perez and
with the country's outgoing president, Jaime Lusinchi, and Colombian
President Virgilio Barco.
   Quayle indicated that he would be discouraging efforts by some of
the leaders, including Perez, to coordinate their tactics and
demands for dealing with creditors.
   The vice president said he phoned former President Richard Nixon
for advice the night before his departure.
   Nixon, as vice president in 1958, made a trip to Venezuela where
he faced violent anti-American crowds. Quayle said they chatted
about that.
   Quayle will stop in El Salvador on his way home Friday. During
meetings with political, military and labor leaders there he will
stress the need to curtail human rights violations in the Central
American country, officials said.
   He will meet with outgoing president Jose Napoleon Duarte of the
Christian Democratic Party and with representatives of right-wing
factions, but not with anyone from the leftist party battling for
power in the March 19 election, U.S. officials said.
   One official said it would be awkward for Quayle to meet with
leftist presidential candidate Guillermo Ungo since he is a civilian
ally of rebels fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed government.
   The vice president will meet with representatives of the rightist
Nationalist Republican Alliance, or ARENA, whose candidate Alfredo
Cristiani has led Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena in opinion
polls, with Ungo trailing.
   No official list of Quayle's meetings has been released.
   But a State Department official involved in planning the trip
said he is scheduled to meet with the presidents of Spain, Portugal,
Brazil, Colombia and Honduras. He will also meet with a group of
Caribbean leaders.
   One of the topics for those meetings will be the status of the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels battling the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   In El Salvador, an administration official said, Quayle intends
to have ``very straightforward'' conversations emphasizing that the
administration is serious about adherence to human rights.
   Officials have expressed concern that continued human rights
problems will make it difficult for the administration to obtain
further U.S. aid for El Salvador from Congress.

<HEAD>Index Up in December but Economists Still See Slower Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday reported its chief
economic forecasting gauge posted a strong 0.6 percent gain in
December, continuing a seesaw pattern that some analysts said
portends slower growth in 1989.
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has reversed course in
each of the last nine months, showing little forward momentum.
December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967 base
of 100, up a slim 2 percent from the same month a year earlier.
   Economists welcomed the continued vacillation as a precursor to
slower, more sustainable growth during the economic expansion's
seventh year, saying restraint would help keep inflation in check
without threatening a serious downturn.
   ``The economy is going to be slowing down but there is no
recession on the horizon,'' said economist David Wyss of Data
Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   Wyss predicted that by the middle of next year, growth would slow
enough for the Federal Reserve Board to ease its tight grip on the
money supply. Since March, the central bank has been pushing up
interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic
growth.
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist for Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities Inc. in Chicago., said the report's saw-toothed
performance ``tells you that there is not a boom building. It
suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the next couple of quarters
but it most assuredly does not point to any kind of a recession.''
   The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowest
quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the
October-December period, when the increase in the gross national
product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent.
   President Bush plans to adopt his predecessor's forecast that the
economy will grow at a 3.2 percent rate in 1989, but many private
economists are making more pessimistic predictions for the coming
year.
   In another economic report released Wednesday by the Commerce
Department, construction spending shot up 2.5 percent in December to
end a weak year on a strong note.
   Construction spending for all of 1988 totaled $403.4 billion, up
just 1.1 percent from 1987. Taking inflation into account, spending
actually was down 0.4 percent. It was the slowest performance since
the recession year of 1982.
   Economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago said
that while the finish of 1988 was surprisingly strong, construction
spending is likely to slacken this year as rising interest rates
take their toll.
   December's increase in the leading index was bolstered by
positive movement in six of the nine available components.
   The biggest boost came from an increase in manufacturers' orders
for consumer goods. Other positive business barometers were: rising
stock prices, more orders for new plants and equipment, rising
prices for raw materials signaling a strong demand, increased demand
for business permits and growth in the inflation-adjusted money
supply.
   The two indicators that made a negative contribution were a
shortening in the length of the average work week and an increase in
weekly unemployment claims. One indicator, the time needed for
companies to receive deliveries from vendors, was unchanged.
   While the index's recent waffling was seen by many as a sign of
slower growth ahead, Annable said December's strong showing suggests
``this economy still has a lot of momentum going into the first
quarter of the year.''
   ``You've got all the factors in line to make this a pretty good
growth year,'' he said. ``The economy is slowing, but it's not
slowing down dramatically.''
   The leading index, designed to show what direction the economy
will head six to nine months in the future, traditionally is thought
to be predicting a recession if it declines three months in a row.
   The index has correctly forecast all eight recessions since it
was created in 1948, but also has falsely predicted recessions four
times.
   Starting with the report for January, its components are being
revised in an effort to make the index more accurately reflect
future economic activity.

<HEAD>Investigators: Two Were Hired To Kill Sheriff For $20,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two men accused of planting a remote-control
bomb that seriously injured a sheriff were hired to kill him for
$20,000, federal authorities charged in court papers today.
   The complaint was made public one day after the men, one of them
a former police officer, were arrested in the bombing in December
that nearly ripped off Lafourche Parish Sheriff Duffy Breaux's foot
and seriously injured a deputy.
   The complaint includes an affidavit based on information from an
unidentified source on the suspects, Marshall K. McClendon, 42, of
Slaughter and John G. Tullier Jr., 23, of St. Amant.
   The document does not say who wanted Breaux killed or why.
   ``We feel we have a lot more work to do,'' said Mike Hall, agent
in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in
New Orleans. ``I would just say we definitely would anticipate more
arrests.''
   McClendon and Tullier were to appear today before a magistrate in
Baton Rouge for a bail hearing on bombing and conspiracy charges.
   According to federal agents, McClendon is a former police officer
in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. He also held a Lafourche Parish
Sheriff's commission and was involved with a regional drug task
force there in the early 1970s.
   Tullier was identified as an unemployed instrument fitter.
   If convicted, they could get up to 25 years in prison and a
$25,000 fine.
   The federal complaint said the men collected $8,000 and were to
receive $12,000 more once Breaux was dead.
   The complaint said the bomb was a box holding two pipes, each
loaded with explosives, nails and bullets. It appeared to have been
detonated by a model airplane remote control device.
   Breaux, 60, and part-time deputy Daniel Leche, 62, were injured
as they left a Christmas party for senior citizens at the Thibodaux
Civic Center.
   Breaux noticed a paper bag by his car and pushed it with his left
foot, authorities said. The pipe bomb inside exploded, spraying him
with nails and bullets.
   Doctors at Thibodaux General Hospital said Breaux almost died of
shock and loss of blood. They reconnected his foot and predicted he
will regain 90 percent use of it within a year. He was discharged
from the hospital last month.
   Leche was released after two days in the hospital.

   Fourteen-year-old Staci Elmer left for
school Wednesday ``tired, angry and sad'' because she was kicked out
of her parents' home in a court battle over a rule barring children
from her small subdivision.
   ``There are no rights for the younger generation. There are no
laws for young people. The Constitution isn't for us,'' Staci said
bitterly over a bowl of cereal at her brother's house. ``I'm angry
at my neighbors and sad because I can't stay with my parents.''
   She said it was hard making the adjustment to her temporary new
home, about six miles from the two-block-long mobile home park she
was evicted from the day before because deed restrictions bar
children under 15.
   ``It was scary waking up this morning. I didn't know where I was
at first,'' Staci said.
   On Tuesday, Pasco Circuit Judge Wayne Cobb rejected Beverly and
Thomas Elmer's request to delay a Jan. 6 order. He said if Staci
wasn't out of the house by 5 p.m. the couple would go to jail for 10
days.
   The judge said Staci, a quiet A-B freshman at Zephyrhills High
School, may come home for visits, even for overnight, but may not
move home permanently until she turns 15 on April 7. She says she
will move home then.
   ``We have nothing against the girl; it's the principle,'' said
Aline Murray. She is one of the neighbors who sued to preserve the
adults-only status of the tiny mobile home settlement on the back
streets in this quiet retirement community. ``We bought here with
the idea of peace and quiet in our old age.''
   The feud began shortly after the Elmers moved into the unnamed
subdivision of 17 households in fall 1987. The neighborhood, two
short blocks of neatly kept homes, is composed of retirees, except
for the Elmers.
   Mrs. Elmer, a realtor-associate, admits she knew about the age
restriction before buying. But she liked the area; it was affordable
and convenient to work and school. Other residents, she said,
violated deed restrictions governing placement of clotheslines and
propane tanks so she didn't think Staci would be a problem.
   She was wrong.
   All the neighbors hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit in May to
enforce the age clause. In August, a judge upheld the deed
restrictions and said Staci had to go.
   Staci stayed.
   Earlier this month Cobb said he had no choice but to find the
parents in contempt. He set a deadline for them to comply or report
to jail.
   The Elmers' attorney, Mary Greenwood, made one last bid Tuesday
to delay Staci's move until mid-March after amendments to a federal
housing law take effect outlawing age restrictions in some
communities. The judge rejected the request and scheduled a hearing
for March 22.
   ``I knew it would happen because the neighbors don't like me.
They would have done anything to get rid of me,'' Staci said.
   Bruce Murray, a retired law enforcement officer from Pittsburgh,
was satisfied with the outcome. If the deed restriction was broken,
he said, it would open up the area for sale to anyone.
   Mrs. Elmer, whose husband is a long-distance truck driver,
worries about the scars on her daughter.
   In fact, Staci was so upset after the ruling she had her mother
stay overnight with her at her married brother Darwyn's house.
   ``This is hard on Staci emotionally,'' said Mrs. Elmer, 45. ``I
can't believe people can be this cruel. They didn't care if she had
to sleep on a park bench.
   ``If I had thought all this would happen, there'd been no way I
would have done this to hurt Staci. But at this point, I would not
sell my house. We've gone through too much.''

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Seen as Independent, But Liberal Image Lingers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party regulars on Wednesday
described incoming party chairman Ronald H. Brown as ``his own
man,'' but there was widespread concern that his ties to Jesse
Jackson and Edward M. Kennedy would reinforce the party's liberal
image.
   ``I don't see him as Jackson's man,'' said Sam Shipley, chairman
of the Delaware Democratic Party. ``I see him as his own man. I
think most (people) see him as Jackson's man, but not the party
leaders.''
   An Associated Press survey of state Democratic Party leaders and
elected officials disclosed a wide range of opinion about the impact
Brown's election might have on party fortunes.
   They spoke as the chairman-to-be prepared to head into the South
on Thursday on a trip designed to confront concerns of party leaders
in a region marked by the conservative cast of its politics.
   Now unopposed for the party leadership post, Brown will become
chairman at the Democratic National Committee meeting in Washington
on Feb. 10 _ the first black to head a major political party. He
emerged the victor in a five-way contest that included three former
House members and the chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party.
   Brown joined Jackson's presidential campaign in May 1988 and as
his convention manager was Jackson's principal negotiator with aides
to Michael Dukakis.
   Brown also played a major role in Kennedy's 1980 presidential
campaign and was general counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee
when Kennedy was chairman.
   While many party officials said they were confident of Brown's
independence, doubts remained among conservative Democrats. Their
concerns were based not on Brown's views on issues but on his ties
to party liberals.
   ``He is Jackson's man,'' said John Henry Anderson, the Georgia
Democratic Party chairman. But he expressed desire to work with
Brown.
   ``Nothing is as bad tomorrow as it looks today,'' he said.
   Louisiana Sen. John Breaux, chairman of the Democratic Senate
Campaign Committee, was one of the last holdouts for an alternative
to Brown.
   But Breaux said Brown's role as convention chairman for the
Jackson presidential campaign should not be held against him.
   ``There were a lot of moderates and whites who urged him to take
that job at the convention and be a moderator,'' Breaux said. ``Now
I think the same people should be willing to give him a chance.''
   He urged Brown to appoint a task force to address the concerns of
moderates.
   Some legislative leaders voiced concern that Brown's selection
could hurt Democrats in local races _ a possibility most respondents
thought unlikely.
   ``I don't know Ron Brown,'' said R. Clayton Mitchell, speaker of
the Maryland House of Delegates. ``I don't know anything about Ron
Brown. But people I've talked to are concerned it might hurt us.''
Mitchell said there was a conservative trend in the country and ``a
lot of people are concerned we're moving away from the national
trend.''
   Martin Tandler, a New York businessman active in raising money
for Democratic Senate and House candidates, said Brown's election
``may be a problem in that on a national level the Democratic Party
has managed to either paint itself or be painted into a corner that
represents the interests of minorities and women and disenfranchised
to the exclusion of the middle class.''
   ``It's a very positive step for us to pick a black chairman,''
said John Marino, executive director of the New York Democratic
Party. ``That's because we don't look at Ron Brown as simply being
black. We look upon him as someone who can unite all Democrats and
put it together.''
   Some of the strongest early opposition to Brown came from Alabama
Democratic chairman John Baker, who said he would consider
boycotting national party functions if Brown became chairman. He
said a Brown chairmanship would be a victory for the ``ultra-liberal
wing'' of the party.
   Joe Reed, a black Alabama Democratic official, countered that
``with that kind of talk (by Baker), Lee Atwater (the Republican
national chairman) would not have a hard job getting blacks to join
the Republican Party.''
   Mac Parsons, an Alabama state senator with strong ties to
organized labor, said Brown's election furthers the image of the
Democrats as the party of blacks and liberals.
   ``Unfortunately, in politics, once the image is created, it's
awfully difficult to change, even if the image is incorrect,'' he
said.
   Peter Kelly, a Connecticut party leader, said Brown might have to
take a step comparable to Richard Nixon's move to normalize
relations with China, a step made easier by Nixon's long history as
a fervent anti-communist.
   ``Ron Brown comes from the liberal wing of the party and will, as
the saying goes, have to go to China like Nixon did,'' Kelly said.
``The ball's in his court.''
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado met with Brown last weekend and said
he told Brown ``the party's goals need to be redefined. I meant that
the Democrats have to help to make a free market work and be frugal
in spending.''
   Romer said that while there was a perception that Brown is tied
to Jackson ``it will be corrected shortly.''

   Alexandra Jane Dukakis, the first grandchild of
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was born Wednesday, more than a week
overdue.
   The baby was delivered after a difficult pregnancy that forced
her mother, Lisa Dukakis, 33, to remain in bed for months and
abandon the presidential campaign that occupied the rest of the
family for most of 1988.
   The new father, John Dukakis, 30, the son of Mrs. Dukakis' first
marriage, managed the Southern primaries for the Dukakis campaign.
Although the younger Dukakis was never adopted by the governor, he
has used his stepfather's name.
   A buoyant Gov. Dukakis was telling visitors about the
long-awaited birth and accepting congratulations at his Statehouse
office Wednesday morning. The governor said he planned to scrap his
official schedule in the afternoon so he and his wife could visit
the new grandchild.
   ``Mother and child are healthy and happy and resting
comfortably,'' said Dukakis spokesman James Dorsey.

   Country music star Hank Williams Jr. says
he is still haunted by memories of a 500-foot fall down a Montana
mountain while he was hiking in 1975.
   Williams, son of a country music pioneer, said he thinks about
the near-fatal accident when he sees TV shows about mountains.
   ``I've had dreams about it,'' he said Tuesday in an interview.
``I should have died. The doctor said he had worked on plenty of
boys in Vietnam and to be frank, they looked good compared to me. He
said I had been left here (spared death) for something. I think
about that all the time.''
   Williams, 39, spent a year recovering from the head injuries. He
wears a beard and sunglasses to hide the scars.
   He has been voted entertainer of the year for the past two years
by the Country Music Association. His hit records include ``If the
South Woulda Won,'' ``Born to Boogie'' and ``All My Rowdy Friends
Are Coming Over Tonight.''

   Actor Ted Danson joined Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley to announce a new conservation group opposed to
the planned sale of ocean lots for offshore oil drilling.
   Danson, star of the long-running television series ``Cheers,''
will be president of the American Oceans Conservation Committee,
which will mount a campaign to fight the Interior Department's
planned Lease Sale 95 that would open 5 million acres to drilling.
   ``The federal government's plan could result in a coastline
dotted with drilling platforms the size of two football fields and
25 stories high,'' Danson said at a news conference Tuesday.
   The actor is best known for playing the amorous ex-athlete turned
bartender in NBC's ``Cheers,'' and also starred in the films ``Three
Men and a Baby'' and the movie for television, ``Something About
Amelia.''
   Lending their support to Danson's committee were Sens. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., Pete Wilson, R-Calif., state Assemblyman Tom
Hayden, actresses Sally Field and Ally Sheedy, actors Lloyd Bridges,
James Garner and Danny DeVito, and several members of the ``Cheers''

   Retired federal prosecutor Rudolph W. Giuliani
said he would be ``pounding the pavement'' on the first day of his
new status as unemployed lawyer.
   The racket-busting U.S. Attorney for Manhattan resigned from the

he has not denied speculation that he is thinking of running for
mayor as a Republican.
   Giuliani said in Washington on Tuesday that on his first day off
the job he planned to spend ``an extra hour playing with my son,''
Andrew, 3, followed by breakfast with a prospective employer.
   When reporters asked where Giuliani could be found Wednesday he
said: ``Pounding the pavement.''

   Construction spending, depressed by a downturn
in work on apartment buildings, rose just 1.1 percent last year, the
weakest showing since the recession year of 1982, the government
reported Wednesday.
   The year ended on a strong note, however, as construction
spending rose 2.5 percent in December, the Commerce Department
reported.
   Spending for all of 1988 totaled $403.4 billion, a slim increase
from $398.9 billion in the previous year. But after taking into
account inflation, spending actually was down 0.4 percent from 1987.
   Construction spending had been down 5.2 percent in 1982, or 8.1
percent after adjusting for inflation.
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist for Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities Inc. in Chicago, said that while construction strength
increased at the end of 1988 due to strong growth in personal
income, spending this year should be moderate as interest rates rise.
   ``If interest rates do continue rising that should act as a
squeeze on overall construction spending,'' he said. ``I don't think
it's going to be a banner year.''
   Last year's spending pace was depressed by slow activity on
apartments, a category that suffered from high vacancy rates and was
still feeling the impact of the 1986 tax overhaul that curtailed tax
breaks for construction investments.
   In inflation-adjusted dollars, apartment construction was down
13.9 percent to $19.3 billion last year, while work on single-family
homes rose 2.9 percent to $103.6 billion. Non-residential
construction spending was down a slight 0.1 percent to $78.1
billion, while spending on government projects was down 0.4 percent
to $65.8 billion after adjusting for inflation.
   High mortgage interest rates have restrained construction
activity in most sectors. Fixed-rate home mortgages averaged 10.6
percent last week, up from 10.16 percent a year earlier, according
to the Federal National Mortgage Association.
   Economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago said
that while construction spending is likely to slacken later this
year, the finish of 1988 was stronger than expected.
   ``Construction has stayed surprisingly strong, given interest
rates and the upward pressure on interest rates,'' he said. ``They
haven't had quite as much bite as history might have told us.''
   Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$422.7 billion in December, the fourth straight monthly rise. The
2.5 percent increase was the best since a 2.8 percent rise last
March.
   For the month, residential construction rose 0.3 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $220.9 billion, reflecting a 1.1
percent gain in single-family home building. Apartment construction
dropped 2.3 percent.
   Non-residential construction rose 3.4 percent to an annual rate
of $96.4 billion. Spending on government projects was up 7.8 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $86.8 billion.
   The monthly figures are not adjusted for inflation.

<HEAD>Movie Critic Ban May Violate Rights, Attorney General Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLYTHE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ban by the only movie theater in town on
the only movie critic in town may violate a civil rights law, the
state attorney general's office says.
   But the office is advising the editor of Blythe's twice-weekly
Palo Verde Valley Times to work for an amicable settlement to his
dispute with the Blythe Community Cinema.
   Editor Harold Stanford said Tuesday he has been advised by a
deputy to Attorney General John Van de Kamp that the theater's ban
on his movie critic is probably a violation of the state's Unruh
Civil Rights Act, an interpretation disputed Wednesday by an
attorney for the theater owner.
   Stanford said Van de Kamp's office hasn't responded to his
request that the state sue the theater on behalf of the paper and
its part-time movie critic, Cathy Monnett.
   Mrs. Monnett, who works for the price of her tickets and who
refuses to review R-rated movies, was banned from the theater Dec.
14. Managers said her negative reviews were hurting business, but
she has responded that most of her comments have been positive.
   Alan Ashby, a spokesman for Van de Kamp, confirmed the office had
been asked to pursue the case, but indicated the Van de Kamp would
prefer to see the parties settle their differences amicably.
   ``We told him that the California Supreme Court ... held that the
Unruh Act can be broadly interpreted to prohibit all unreasonable
discrimination by private businesses,'' Ashby said.
   Los Angeles attorney Don Davis, brother of theater owner Paul
Davis, said he disagreed that the ban on the critic violates the
state civil rights law, because courts have ruled the law applies to
arbitrary discrimination against classes of people.
   ``If we eliminated all film critics by class, or all children, or
all women, that would be class discrimination and that would be
arbitrary,'' Davis said. ``Those same court rulings say you can
eject somebody from your establishment that's injurious to your
business.''
   Since the ban, Stanford has been sending Mrs. Monnett to Yuma,
Ariz., a round trip of more than 100 miles, to review movies that
will be shown in Blythe, a desert town along on the
California-Arizona border.
   Theater officials said they offered to let Mrs. Monnett return if
the newspaper would run reviews by a theater-hired critic next to
her reviews. Stanford rejected that offer, saying the other critic
would be ``P.R. hype in our newspaper.''

   The State Department accused the Soviet Union
on Wednesday of continuing widespread bombing attacks inside
Afghanistan, charging that ``unprecedented destruction'' has
occurred as Soviet troops withdraw.
   Department spokeswoman Charles Redman renewed accusations made
repeatedly in recent weeks against the Soviet raids, contending that
the number of sorties ``continues to be very high. ... It's in a lot
of parts of the country'' and included high-altitude bombing runs,
artillery and missile attacks.
   The spokesman did say, however, that the United States welcomed
the pledge by the top Soviet general in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Boris
Gromov, that once the pullout is completed by the Feb. 15 deadline,
Moscow will halt the bombing raids.
   ``Those kind of assurances are welcome and we expect Moscow to
live up to this public commitment,'' Redman said.
   On Monday, Redman charged the Soviets with conducting a
``scorched earth'' campaign as their military forces depart, an
assertion that Gromov denied.
   While Redman said he had no way of quantifying the casualty
rates, he said ``hundreds of civilians'' had been killed during the
bombing raids.
   And when asked whether he knew if Afghan guerrillas were present
in the areas targeted by the Soviets, Redman did not answer directly.
   The spokesman said that besides the bombardment directed in the
area of the departure route, there has been ``mass destruction of
villages'' along the highway that links Kabul with the Soviet border
and villages some distance from the highway.
   The highway is the only land route home for Red Army troops in
Kabul, and the Krelim has complained that withdrawing Soviet troops
have been attacked by the U.S.-armed rebel forces.
   ``The salient facts today are massive Soviet bombardment of
Afghanistan and, secondly, massive stockpiling of Soviet equipment
in the hands of the Afghan regime,'' Redman said. ``The fact of the
matter is intensive, unprecedented destruction in Afghanistan.''
   Redman repeated once again that that United States considers the
bombing raids to be in violation of the assurances provided by the
Soviets last year in connection with the agreement signed in Geneva
outlining the Soviet withdrawal.
   ``To see here, in the last weeks, this just massive effort aimed
at destroying even more of Afghanistan and without question killing
Afghans _ it just doesn't seem to be what ought to be a policy
followed by anyone at this stage of the game,'' Redman said.

   Authorities eased a curfew here
Wednesday, but ethnic tensions remain high in this republic that was
the site of mass demonstrations before being hit by a devastating
earthquake in December.
   The military commander in Yerevan, in an announcement published
in the daily newspaper Kommunist, said the midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew
would be reduced further to 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.
   The decision was made ``considering the stabilization of the
situation in the capital and regions of the republic during the past
month, the participation of citizens in supporting public order and
requests of residents,'' the newspaper said.
   A government commission called for speeding up construction to
clear the debris and build new housing in northwestern regions of
the republic stricken by the Dec. 7 earthquake, which killed an
estimated 25,000 people and left a half million homeless. The
commission complained the organizations involved in reconstruction
are bickering among themselves and making little progress.
   Also on Wednesday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson visited Armenian
leaders in a tour he said would help him determine what further aid
can be provided.
   The curfew in Yerevan was imposed in November after at least 30
people were killed in ethnic rioting in Armenia and the neighboring
republic of Azerbaijan.
   The streets of the Armenian capital, which a few weeks ago were
dotted with tanks, armored personal carriers and Interior Ministry
troops, were comparatively demilitarized this week.
   Only a handful of soldiers and one armored personnel carrier were
visible on Opera Square, the site of street protests last year. In
the most recent violence, the square was surrounded by troops and
military vehicles.
   On Lenin Square, there were no tanks, although six armored
personel carriers and a handful of troops were deployed at main
government buildings.
   Armenian refugees from the violence in Azerbaijan gathered
Wednesday, as they have for several weeks, outside the Agriculture
Committee offices to discuss their fate. Soviet authorities say
about 300,000 people _ Armenians who were living in Azerbaijan and
Azerbaijanis from Armenia _ have fled to their ancestral republics.
   Since February 1988, residents of the predominantly Armenian
region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan have been agitating to be
made part of the republic of Armenia. Armenians are predominantly
Christian, while Azerbaijanis are predominantly Moslem.
   People in a crowd of about 100 refugees said the government is
refusing to give them jobs or homes. They said they were afraid
their lives would be in danger if they returned to Azerbaijan.
   ``I consider that it's better to die here in Yerevan than to try
to live there,'' said Gena Agabekyan, an ethnic Armenian who fled
the Azerbaijan capital of Baku two months ago.
   Agabekyan, who fled along with his teen-age son, daughter, mother
and wife, said the government had given him the equivalent of $160
for each member of his family, but what he really wanted was a job.
He said he had worked in Baku as a crane operator for the Azerbaijan
Film Committee but was fired eight months ago.
   ``Because I am an Armenian, no reason was given,'' said
Agabekyan, 50.
   Authorities have been trying to persuade the refugees to return
to their homes, but have met with only limited success.
   Yuri Khodzhamiryan, a deputy premier of Armenia, told Soviet and
foreign journalists the government was not forcing any of the
refugees to return.
   ``If they want to return, normal conditions are created for them
there,'' he said. But he acknowledged authorities were having
trouble finding places for the refugees to live because most vacant
apartments were turned over to those left homeless by the earthquake.
   Neither police nor the Interior Ministry's security forces
interfered with the refugees, who gathered to discuss their cases.
The crowd was peaceful with none of the shouting or banner waving
that characterized the mass protests of recent months.

   A military judge Wednesday convicted a
Marine sergeant of negligence for his actions following the
abandonment of a Marine who died in the Mojave desert.
   Sgt. Christopher Clyde was the platoon sergeant of Lance Cpl.
Jason Rother, who was left behind after being posted as a road guide
for an exercise at Twentynine Palms, Calif., last Aug. 30. The
remains of Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, were not found until December.
   Maj. Kent Smith, the military judge, ruled that Clyde was
negligent by failing to follow policies, failing to report the
status of his Marines and to properly account for the whereabouts
and the welfare of his Marines.
   He was found innocent of willful disobedience.
   No sentencing has been scheduled, and a military hearing was held
Wednesday afternoon to outline possible penalties.
   Clyde, 28, of Mentor, Ohio, showed no emotion as Smith read the
verdict.
   Clyde had been charged with dereliction of duty and failing to
obey an order to not give time off to his men. Clyde had maintained
he did nothing wrong and that he only reacted to the instructions of
his superiors.
   ``If he's guilty of anything, he's guilty of relying on other
people,'' defense attorney William Fisher said in closing arguments.
   Prosecutor Robert Nunally had urged Smith to convict Clyde.
   ``He screwed up and he screwed up in a major way,'' Nunally said
in closing arguments.
   A court-martial was scheduled to begin Thursday for Sgt. Thomas
B. Turnell, Rother's squad leader.
   Turnell, 25, of Elrama, Pa., is charged with dereliction of duty,
willful disobedience of a lawful order and unauthorized absence.
   Also facing charges is 1st Lt. Allen V. Lawson, who is scheduled
for court-martial on Feb. 7. He was in charge of assigning road
guides during the exercise.

   William deBerniere Mebane, publisher of
The Greenville News and Greenville Piedmont, on Wednesday was named
president of Multimedia Inc.'s newspaper division, company officials
said.
   Mebane, 40, succeeds Donald J. Barhyte, who is resigning.
   ``He (Mebane) has exhibited leadership throughout the 18 years he
has been with the company,'' said Walter E. Bartlett, president and
chief executive of Multimedia.
   Barhyte, 52, said he was resigning ``for personal reasons,'' and
will continue to be associated with Multimedia in an advisory
capacity. He also will leave the company's board, he said.
   Mebane, who is vice president of the newspaper division as well
as publisher, becomes the division's president on March 1.
   Mebane joined Multimedia in 1971. He also has been assistant
business manager, business manager and general manager.
   Multimedia is a diversified media communications company which
publishes 14 daily newspapers in South Carolina, North Carolina,
Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Ohio, Virginia and Tennessee.
   The company also owns 40 non-daily newspapers, four television
and seven radio stations, operates more than 100 cable franchises in
four states, and produces and syndicates television programming,
including the Phil Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael shows.

   Racial slurs and obscenities
spray-painted on two buildings and a fence at the Lincoln Home
National Historic Site have been removed, officials said Wednesday.
   ``It's all been cleaned up. ... Right after we discovered it we
began cleanup,'' said acting site superintendent Larry Blake.
   Damage was estimated at $500. Pink and blue fluorescent paint was
sprayed Monday or early Tuesday on the carriage house behind
Lincoln's home, an adjacent shed and a white wooden fence behind the
shed. Meters and an air conditioner also were damaged.
   Vandalism at the site is not common, Blake said.
   ``Usually it's fairly uncommon because the Springfield community
has a great deal of respect for the Lincoln sites as a whole, so we
don't really have a lot of problems with vandalism,'' he said.
   Because the damage occurred on federal property, the FBI was
investigating, Blake said. No arrests had been made.
   The Lincoln home, the only house the nation's 16th president ever
owned, was reopened last year after a multimillion-dollar renovation.
   In 1987, Lincoln's Tomb, in Oak Ridge Cemetery several miles from
the home, was vandalized with spray paint. Five teen-agers and an
adult were arrested and later were convicted or pleaded guilty to
charges connected with the vandalism and damage to nearby graves.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says U.S. Decides to Reduce Scale of Exercises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon announced Wednesday that the
United States has decided to reduce the scale of NATO's Reforger
exercises in what one defense official called an attempt ``to lower
the heat of political debate in West Germany.''
   Defense officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the changes
would allow the United States and its allies to reduce the impact of
field training on the West German public.
   The Defense Department announced its plans to change Reforger
exercises in a statement Wednesday while denying they were tied in
any way to politics. Indeed, the Pentagon's press release portrayed
the modifications as an ``enhancement'' that would allow U.S. Army
troops to ``train smarter.''
   Pentagon sources said, however, the goal of ``training smarter''
would be reached by reducing the number of troops moved from the
United States to Europe for field maneuvers; reducing the scope of
exercise maneuvers by all troops, including those posted to Europe
full time, and relying to a greater extent on computer simulations
to train battle staffs.
   ``They can call this an enhancement if they want, but we're also
trying to lower the heat of political debate in West Germany,'' said
one official, referring to growing complaints there about low-level
military flight training and plans to modernize nuclear missiles.
   ``We can't afford to lose public opinion to (Soviet President
Mikhail S.) Gorbachev and his PR campaign,'' said another source,
citing announcements by the Soviet leader of unilateral troop cuts.
   ``If we can accomplish our major training aims and lessen the
impact of our training on the populace, then we should do that. And
if we can save some money, given the budget environment back here
and concerns about sharing NATO burdens, so much the better,'' the
source said.
   In December, Gorbachev announced at the United Nations that the
Soviet Union would unilaterally cut its military forces by a
half-million troops and reduce its conventional arms substantially.
   The Reforger (Return of Forces to Germany) exercises have long
been a mainstay of American as well as NATO deterrent policy. They
normally consist of the large-scale movement of Army troops from the
United States to Europe, simulating the type of reinforcement
operation that would be needed to sustain Western forces in the
event of a Warsaw Pact attack.
   Last year's Reforger, conducted in the late summer and early
fall, involved the deployment of about 17,000 soldiers to Europe.
Once they arrived, ground and aerial maneuvers were conducted in
West Germany with a total 97,700 American and allied troops.
   On Wednesday, the Pentagon announced that Reforger 89, set for
September, had been canceled and would be merged with Reforger 90,
which has now been scheduled for January to March 1990.
   In place of Reforger 89, the allies now intend to stage a smaller
exercise dubbed Caravan Guard ``to test the improved training
techniques planned for Reforger 90,'' the Pentagon said.
   The Defense Department refused to say how many soldiers would
cross the Atlantic Ocean for Reforger 90. It did say, however, the
field manuever portion of the exercise would involve about 75,000
allied troops total _ or more than 20,000 fewer than last year.
   ``In a move designed to enable the U.S. Army Europe to `train
smarter' and ultimately improve combat readiness, the U.S. European
Command has announced a major enhancement to the Reforger exercise
program,'' the Pentagon said in its statement.
   ``The Reforger enhancement program will allow U.S. forces to
obtain the maximum training value from major exercises by
integrating new computer simulation technology, command post
exercises and field training exercises.''
   Cmdr. Mel Sundin, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Pentagon was
convinced that computer technology ``can be used to realistically
simulate a wide range of operational and logistical functions
normally carried out by soldiers in the field.''
   ``When properly integrated, these simulations will force
commanders and their staffs to make real-time decisions just as if
they were issuing orders to deployed units,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Asked to Delay Detroit Newspapers' Partial Merger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of the partial merger of The Detroit
News and the Detroit Free Press asked a federal appeals court
Wednesday to delay the business deal until a legal battle over the
agreement is resolved.
   The motion, filed by Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press,
a coalition of newspaper advertisers and readers, sought to halt the
newspapers' plan to proceed with the merger on Feb. 6. The group is
asking the full 13-member U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit to hear arguments for rejecting the proposed merger.
   The motion said implementing the agreement would ``result in the
elimination of approximately 500 jobs, the publication of a single
paper on weekends, increased circulation prices and probably higher
advertising prices as well.''
   The newspapers would suffer ``comparatively little harm'' should
the agreement be delayed, the motion said.
   Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of the News, disputed the contention
that the newspapers would suffer little harm from further delay. A
spokesman for the newspaper group, Frank Hawkins, said in Miami that
the delay is ``costing something in the range of $50,000 a day.''
   ``That turns into a lot of money in a hurry,'' Hawkins said.
   The News' publisher, Louis Weil, said in Detroit, ``Financially,
neither paper is making money right now. For that exact reason we
want to move forward, because all of this has gone on long enough.
   ``But even more importantly, in terms of the employees, it's time
to bring this to a conclusion. That's why we're moving forward,''
Weil said.
   Gannett Co. Inc., owner of the Free Press, declined comment from
its Arlington, Va., headquarters.
   Free Press Publisher David Lawrence said, ``In fact, the great
harm continues. Not only the harm in terms of thousands of dollars
that are lost each day, but the harm in the uncertainty which has
clouded this newspaper's future for almost three years now.''
   ``People here are entitled to know that their jobs are safe, that
their newspaper can go ahead. Readers of the newspaper are entitled
to know their paper has a future.''
   Under the proposed 100-year agreement, the News and Free Press
would combine business and production operations, while maintaining
separate news and editorial departments.
   Gannett initially would take 55 percent of the joint operations'
profits or losses. After six years, the split would be 50-50 between
Gannett and Knight-Ridder. Knight-Ridder has said it will close the
Free Press without a joint operating agreement.
   An three-judge appeals court panel, splitting 2-to-1, on Friday
rejected opponents' arguments that then-Attorney General Edwin Meese
III had gone beyond the intent of the law in approving the joint
operating agreement, an exemption from federal anti-trust laws
allowed when one of the newspapers is in danger of financial failure.

<HEAD>2,500 Military Personnel in Nationwide Special Operations Exercise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,500 Army and Air Force
personnel are invading national forests and military bases as part
of a joint exercise designed to improve coordination between
branches of the armed services.
   The six-week training exercise, dubbed Jaguar Bite, began Jan. 9
at seven sites in six states to give troops a taste of different
terrains and climates. It ends Feb. 17.
   The exercise helps improve interservice coordination right down
to combat uniforms worn by commanders at this Army post where the
exercise is headquartered, said Air Force Brig. Gen. Hanson Scott.
   ``If you were to walk in right now you would be hard pressed to
tell who is an Army guy and who is an Air Force guy,'' said Scott,
who is deputy director of the exercise.
   Jaguar Bite is the largest nationwide exercise conducted by the
Defense Department's join special forces command since it was
created nearly two years ago.
   The reason for establishment of the U.S. Special Operations
Command, based at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, was to improve
coordination among special forces in the various services such as
the Army's Green Berets and Navy's SEALs.
   ``If you go back some years ago, perhaps all the services were
guilty of not having enough joint training,'' Scott said.
   Poor coordination of special operations became the targe of
congressional criticism after a hostage-rescue mission to Iran in
1980 ended in disaster. A Navy helicopter and an Air Force cargo
plane collided at a desert staging area, killing eight servicemen.
   One important aspect of training side-by-side is that members of
the different service branches learn to understand each other's
jargon and acronyms that are so popular in the military, Scott said.
   Unlike conventional military exercises, Jaguar Bite is primarily
conducted at night and with small units to simulate the unique
missions of special operations, including fast deployment over long
distances and infiltrating enemy lines.
   Scott said the exercise has been going well except for some
severe winter weather in northern states. A deployment to Michigan's
upper peninsula was delayed and troops were withdrawn from the field
in Montana.
   ``We didn't see, for a peacetime exercise, leaving the people out
there,'' he said, although they were equipped to survive the harsh
weather.
   The training sites are Fort Chaffee, Ark.; Fort Bragg, N.C.;
Helena National Forest, Mont.; Ocala National Forest, Fla.; Francis
Marion National Forest, S.C.,, Hiawatha National Forest, Mich., and
Cherry Point Marine Corps Station, N.C., where a battalion of
Marines is playing the role of an aggressor force.

   A newspaper Wednesday criticized China's ``stupid
habit of banquets,'' saying they waste money and don't compare to
parties in the West.
   The newspaper Economic Information said Chinese officials eat,
drink and waste too much during their ubiquitous feasts,
impoverishing the country's coffers and threatening the health of
the revelers.
   The state-run press is engaged in a campaign to illuminate social
problems resulting from China's economic reforms, designed to open
China to the West.
   A recent article on liquor in the China Youth News, called the
Chinese spirit, maotai, an ``all-purpose grease'' for bribing
officials. Another report in the Peasant's Daily told a short story
about a young woman who became a prostitute because she loved money.
   Sunday marks the start of the Spring Festival, the lunar new year
and China's biggest holiday. Families, enterprises and ministries
regularly hold banquets during the holidays, consuming large amounts
of food and drink.
   ``In the weeks before and after the Spring Festival, who knows
how much food will be waisted and how many people will get sick
because of overindulgence,'' the article said.
   The main reason for overindulgence, the article said, was that
Chinese people are not educated enough.
   ``As soon as a stupid person gets a little money ... the first
thing he thinks about is a banquet, eating and drinking,'' said the
article, titled ``Get Rid of the Stupid Habit of Banquets.'' ``Over
time, this foolishness has become a custom that won't be changed
easily.''
   ``The poorer you are the bigger the banquet,'' the story said,
pointing to weddings.
   ``A couple with an elementary school education will fill 20
tables for their wedding banquet, those with a high school education
will reserve five, a couple who has graduated from college will
handle two tables and those with a doctorate won't even fill one,''
it said.
   Another problem is that too many dishes are served.
   ``We treat our guests as if they're starving to death,'' the
article said. ``First they're eight cold dishes, then eight hot
dishes, then a whole chicken, then a whole duck, then a giant carp,
then a hot pot, then dessert and fruit.''
   By the time the feast is over, about two-thirds of the food
remains.
   Alcohol was cited as another problem.
   ``Revelers won't rest until they make the guests drunk.'' It
said. ``The result is that both guest and host get plastered. The
lighter ones talk nonsense, the heavier ones end up getting sick on
the floor, going home and suffering the curses of their wives or
parents.''
   The story called on Chinese revelers to study parties in the West.
   ``Parties in the West are worth copying in China,'' it said. ``A
host puts some dishes on a table and lets the guest pick and choose
as they please .... Such a method is very convenient.''

<HEAD>Madonna Files Divorce Petition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress-singer Madonna and estranged
husband Sean Penn have agreed on a division of property and filed a
petition for divorce, court records show.
   The Los Angeles County Superior Court petition to dissolve the
stormy three-year marriage cited irreconcilable differences as the
reason for the split, and seeks restoration of the singer's former
name, Madonna Ciccone.
   It also said community property and financial obligations shared
by the couple ``have been disposed of by written agreement.'' No
details were disclosed in the two-page petition filed Jan. 25.
   Madonna publicist Liz Rosenberg said last week that Penn would
get the couple's Malibu home and the singer would keep the New York
apartment. Madonna bought a $2.9 million Hollywood Hills home
earlier this month.
   Penn's attorney, Marcy Rosenblum, declined to comment, and
publicist Lois Smith didn't return telephone calls Wednesday.
   It is the second time the sultry songstress has taken steps to
end her 1985 marriage to Penn. She first filed a Superior Court
divorce petition in 1987, but later withdrew it.
   The latest divorce action follows a Dec. 28 incident in which Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies were called to the
couple's Malibu home after the hot-tempered Penn allegedly beat
Madonna. No charges were filed.
   Madonna rose to fame with her hits ``Borderline'' and ``Like a
Virgin,'' and is perhaps best known by the title of another song,
``Material Girl.'' She starred in the movies ``Desperately Seeking
Susan'' and ``Shanghai Surprise,'' a box office dud co-starring Penn.
   Penn rose to stardom in the movie ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High'' and went on to appear in ``Taps,'' ``The Falcon and the
Snowman'' and ``Colors.''
   Penn served more than half of a 60-day jail term in 1987 for
violating parole by punching a movie extra during filming of the
movie ``Colors.'' He was on probation at the time for punching a man
he accused of trying to kiss Madonna in a nightclub in April 1986.

<HEAD>Constitutional Amendment Introduced on Campaign Spending Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A handful of senators complaining about how
much time is spent on raising campaign money said Wednesday they
want a constitutional amendment to let Congress set limits on the
costs of running for office.
   ``Public office all too often goes to the highest bidder, the
highest spender,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., whose 1986
re-election campaign was among the most expensive in U.S. history.
   The constitutional amendment was introduced by Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., and backed by Cranston and six other senators. It
would allow Congress and state governments to ``set reasonable
limits on campaign expenditures.''
   Hollings, who backed a similar amendment in the last Congress,
said the amendment was needed because of a Supreme Court decision
striking down attempts to limit campaign spending, saying it would
infringe on rights of free speech.
   ``If you're rich, you have freedom of speech,'' Hollings said.
``If you're poor, you have the freedom to shut up.''
   If the amendment were passed by Congress and ratified by the
state legislatures, Hollings said the laws actually imposing the
limits would then be drafted.
   He said Congress would need to go to work to eliminate practices
of raising ``soft money'' _ funds gathered by political parties for
presidential campaigns _ and ``bundling,'' a mechanism that allows
the parties to bypass spending limits on congressional campaigns.
   Coincidentally, the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday
announced that the National Republican Senatorial Committee agreed
to pay a $20,000 fine for its handling of a 1986 fund-raising
campaign for a dozen Senate candidates to which then-Vice President
Bush lent his support.
   The commission found that the committee, set up by the Republican
Party to assist in electing GOP senatorial candidates, violated
federal election law because it did not charge the candidates for
the cost of the fund-raising effort.
   However, the six-member commission deadlocked over a related
question of whether the senatorial committee broke the law by the
way it funneled more than $2.7 million in campaign contributions to
the 12 candidates.
   Republican Senate candidates in Alabama, Arkansas, California,
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, North
Carolina, South Dakota and Vermont were on the receiving end of the
funnel.
   The commission's decision, which was reached last year but was
not released until Wednesday, dealt with bundling, a tactic used by
political committees to gather funds from individual contributors
and then channel the money to a particular candidate specified by
the donor.
   The practice allows organizations to bypass provisions in the law
setting limits on how much money they can give a candidate. Under
the law, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the
Republican National Committee can give no more than a total of
$17,500 to a Senate candidate.
   The elections laws permit political organizations to act as a
conduit for contributions to candidates as long as the organization
does not exert enough control over the money to channel the cash to
whomever it chooses.
   One fund-raising letter sent out by the committee and signed by
Bush asked for contributions for the Senate candidates in South
Dakota, Nevada, Louisiana and California.
   Bush's letter warned that if the four Republicans in those states
``don't raise at least $236,500 in the next 21 days _ they'll lose.''
   ``It's that simple _ and that frightening,'' Bush wrote in the
Sept. 2, 1986, letter. ``That's why I'm counting on you to rush me
your check for $25 by return mail today.''
   All four of those candidates ended up losing.
   Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel for the FEC, argued that
the Republican committee's fund-raising program ``was carefully
designed to channel receipts in ways determined by (the committee)
itself.''
   Stuart Gerson, an attorney for the GOP in the case, said the
donor, not the committee, is in control of the funds.
   ``After all, they write the checks, the party committee does
not,'' Gerson said. ``Once the donor gives, the committee has no
choice but to forward that to the candidate within the appropriate
period of time.''
   While the commission failed to support Noble's argument on that
point, it did find that the Republican committee should have
declared that the $608,568 cost of its fund-raising effort should
have been counted itself as a contribution to the Senate candidates'
campaigns.

<TEXT>
   A contractor doing preliminary repair work
on a highway bridge discovered an 18-inch hole in the deck
Wednesday, forcing state transportation officials to close two of
three lanes while emergency repairs were made.
   ``You can see all the way through the deck,'' said William Keish,
a state Department of Transportation spokesman.
   The Interstate 95 bridge over the Rippowam River in Stamford and
is three miles from the Mianus River bridge in Greenwich, which
collapsed in June 1983, killing three people.
   Keish said the Rippowam River bridge was sound and the 18-inch
hole posed no danger to motorists.
   The bridge lanes closed around 9 a.m., and was to reopen with an
emergency patch in place by the afternoon rush hour, Keish said. The
discovery did not affect morning rush hour, but by 1 p.m., traffic
was backed up three to four miles, state police said.
   The repairs involved ripping up a 4-by-6 foot patch of pavement
and replacing it with a quick-drying patch, Keish said. The entire
bridge deck is to be replaced as part of work to be completed by
June 1991, he said.
   Collapse of the Mianus River bridge in 1983 prompted the state to
begin a multibillion-dollar, 10-year road and bridge repair program.
A Superior Court jury decided three years ago that inadequate
maintenance led to the bridge collapse.
   Keish said there was no comparison between the two bridge
problems.
   ``You had a 100-foot section fall out of a bridge, completely
disappear,'' he said of the Mianus River bridge. ``Here you've got
an 18-inch hole. Our major concern was the traffic, not the hole.''

<TEXT>
   The navy said Wednesday the
sinking of one of its supply ships in the Antarctic did not result
in a major oil spill or an ecological disaster in the pristine
environment.
   Some environmentalists said the accident left a 10-mile oil slick
and that wildlife was already dying. Others said it was too early to
say how much oil spilled and how much damage was done to the region
and its animals.
   ``There could be a small stain'' from the release of oil in the
engine room of the Bahia Paraiso, a navy spokesman said. ``Anything
else, no.''
   The vessel, which carried tourists as well as fuel for several
polar stations, hit a rock Saturday, was evacuated and listed for
three days before sinking in high winds and heavy seas late Tuesday
night. No one was injured.
   The incident occurred in the Bismarck Strait 600 miles south of
Cape Horn on the tip of South America and within two miles of the
U.S. Palmer Research Station, where the ship's 300 tourists and crew
initially were taken.
   The U.S. National Science Foundation said the vessel carried
250,000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an ``incurable disaster''
would result if all the fuel leaked into the unspoiled waters in the
region.
   A spokesman at the research station who requested anonymity said
in a telephone interview that leaking oil had caused a 10-mile slick.
   Officials at the foundation, the U.S. base and Greenpeace said
leaking fuel already has killed some krill, a shrimp-like crustacean
that is the main food of the baleen whale and a vital part of the
Antarctic food chain.
   ``The ship rolled over, is lying on its side almost fully below
the water,'' Peter Wilkniss, director of the foundation's Antarctic
program, told ABC's Good Morning America on Wednesday.
   ``This is a very enclosed area. It's a bay ... bounded by a
glacier and some islands and our (research) station. So if the oil
goes into the area then it will have an effect on the shoreline, on
the ice, on the animals, the organisms, on the sediments,'' he told
ABC.
   The depth of the water was not known.
   Neverthess, it remained unclear Wednesday how much oil had
spilled, and the extent of any ecological damage.
   ``The situation is totally controlled and there is no danger of
any type of release of fuel,'' said the navy spokesman, who demanded
anonymity.
   On Tuesday, the government news agency Telam said the fuel the
ship carried was contained in individual steel drums. The news
agency quoted a navy source as saying ``a spill is practically
impossible.''
   Andrea Figari, the Antarctic expert in Buenos Aires for the
environmental organization Greenpeace, said Wednesday: ``We need
time to confirm whether any oil spilled. News reports said krill
were killed. I'm not sure of that. It looks like the ship sank in
the bay and krill live in the open sea. There wouldn't have been a
lot of krill there.''
   Asked to comment, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires
said, ``We're concerned about the potential of an oil spill, but to
the best of our knowlege so far there isn't one.'' Reports the Bahia
Paraiso carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel appear to be a
``drastic exaggeration,'' he said.
   The Bahia Paraiso, launched in 1980, is a navy vessel that for
three years has chartered excurision voyages as a way to defray
expenses.

<HEAD>Communist Meeting Advanced 10 Days Amid Signs of Party Split</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision to hold a key Central
Committee meeting 10 days earlier than planned fueled speculation
Wednesday about a split in the ruling communist elite over political
reforms and unpopular price increases.
   In a terse announcement after its regular weekly session Tuesday,
the party's Politburo announced the 108-member Central Committee
will meet Feb. 10 to decide ``topical political questions.''
   News that the meeting would take place earlier than the scheduled
Feb. 20 date followed a statement from party leader Karoly Grosz
that differences among the 11 Politburo members are slowing reform.
   Grosz said the Central Committee must decide whether or not it
wants to make leadership changes.
   He and Premier Miklos Nemeth also made clear in separate
statements that they disagree with fellow Politburo member Imre
Pozsgay over the leading reformer's startling weekend statement that
the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt was a popular uprising.
   Only the Central Committee can deliver the final verdict on this
matter, Grosz said, adding that he has seen no new documents backing
Pozsgay's view against the official version that the revolt, quashed
by Soviet troops invited by Hungarian leaders, was a
counterrevolution.
   Grosz also said leadership differences are impeding unpopular
austerity measures and are unsettling Western bankers concerned
about Hungary's timely repayment on its $17 billion foreign debt.
   Two waves of price increases on most consumer staples in January
have prompted strikes and unprecedented protests from the official
trade union organization, which has called for talks with the
government.
   Official statistics in January showed one in five of Hungary's
10.6 million citizens already is living below the poverty line.
   Inflation _ estimated at 12-15 percent by the government and
20-25 percent by economists _ will cut further into Hungarians'
living standards this year.
   Hungarian observers and West and East bloc diplomats noted
Wednesday that while recent political reforms have drawn praise
abroad, they have failed to lift the mood at home. Hungary recently
legalized independent movements and demonstrations.
   Some Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they saw Grosz's statement as no more than an attempt to unify the
leadership behind reforms.
   Others, however, noted the statement implied criticism of both
Pozsgay and chief party ideologist Janos Berecz, who last weekend
suggested the party was not quite capable of ``directing the
processes'' in Hungarian politics.
   Hungary's increasingly candid state media had no independent
comment Wednesday.
   But they did print long summaries of Western press comment,
highlighting foreign speculation that recent events may presage
leadership changes.

   The Internal Revenue Service has again
deluged librarians looking for a few income tax forms with crates of
thousands of forms they don't need, don't want and can't use.
   ``The Bible says `Ask and you shall receive.' But this is
ridiculous and from the IRS of all things,'' Library Director Lisa
Jarisch said Wednesday as another carton of tax forms arrived. The
library already had cartons containing about 10,000 supplemental
schedules.
   Jarisch said she found about 100 of the 1040 forms she had sought
in the box. She originally requested about 1,000 each of the most
commonly used forms, plus instruction booklets, figuring that would
be sufficient for this Berkshire Hills city of 16,000 people.
   ``It was just a quirk,'' said Robert Ruttenberg, a spokesman for
the regional IRS office in Boston, suggesting the problem was the
person taking the telephone order misheard the request.
   Last year, the boxes kept coming until the library had 48,625
forms, instead of the assortment of 5,000 she had ordered. And in
1987, about 24,000 forms were received in response to a similar
request, she said.
   ``The children's librarian is already planning origami (Oriental
paper folding) classes, and the Conservation Commission may name me
the `Woman of the Year' for my regular contributions to the
recycling program,'' Jarisch said. The IRS will take back the forms
only if the library pays for the shipping, she said, ``and I'm not
going to do that.''

   Edwin J. Konopacki was scanning the obituary
section of a newspaper when he found himself among the dear departed.
   ``Edwin J. Konopacki,'' the notice read, declaring his date of
demise as Jan. 27, 1989, his age as 70 and listing his nine
surviving brothers and sisters.
   ``I called the funeral home and said, `What gives? I may look
dead but I'm alive,''' Konopacki said Tuesday. ``I'm in good health,
except I have to take three pills a day for my gout.''
   He telephoned the classified advertising department of
Journal-Sentinel Inc., publisher of Milwaukee's two daily
newspapers, where the notice appeared Monday.
   ``He said he saw his death notice in the paper. ... He asked what
happened,'' said Anna Bartkowski, telephone sales manager for the
department.
   The newspaper alerted the funeral home that had placed the death
notice in the papers, and the investigation began.
   Konopacki said he eventually learned that the case of mistaken
identity started when a man collapsed on a South Side street and was
taken, unconscious, to Sinai Samaritan Medical Center.
   A Medicare card and an insurance company letter addressed to
Konopacki were found on the man, Konopacki said, adding that no
explanation had been found for why the man had the materials.
   A nephew and a woman who was believed to have known Konopacki for
a number of years went to the hospital and identified the man as
Konopacki. The funeral home placed the death notice at the family's
request, said Richard Anderson, one of the home's owners.
   Authorities have since identified the dead man as Ervin W.
Sikorski Sr., 66, of Milwaukee.
   Konopacki, a native of Wisconsin Rapids who moved to Milwaukee
about 20 years ago to work as a chef, has lived since Jan. 10 at the
Salvation Army Emergency Lodge after being victimized by burglaries
of his apartments three times in the past two years.
   This week's mix-up made Konopacki a celebrity among residents of
the emergency lodge.
   Asked Tuesday how Konopacki was faring, director Maureen Martin
replied: ``He's alive and well.''

<HEAD>Editor Says Gorbachev Makes Much More Than Typical Soviet Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev earns $28,800 a
year, about seven times the pay of a typical Soviet worker, the
editor of a muckraking Moscow weekly said Wednesday.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of the magazine Ogonyok, told The
Associated Press that with his salary, the Soviet leader can afford
to keep his wife dressed in stylish clothes.
   Despite glasnost, Gorbachev's policy of greater openness that has
permitted magazines such as Ogonyok to flourish, the salaries,
perquisites and personal lives of Soviet leaders are not discussed
in its media.
   Korotich said in a telephone interview he had mentioned the
salary figure and Raisa Gorbachev's wardrobe in an informal talk to
student activists in Komsomol, the Young Communist League, and his
remarks were published in a youth newspaper in the republic of
Moldavia.
   Korotich, who is generally viewed as a supporter and beneficiary
of Gorbachev, said he was neither criticizing nor defending
Gorbachev in his talk.
   He said one of the students asked what he thought about Mrs.
Gorbachev wearing fancy clothes and he replied that on the
president's salary of more than 1,500 rubles a month, Gorbachev can
afford to buy her new dresses sometimes. That equals $2,400 a month
at the official rate of exchange.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's clothes, quite fashionable by Soviet standards
and often mentioned during her trips abroad, are the subject of
considerable grumbling among Soviet women who aren't accustomed to
their leaders' wives appearing in public and who suffer from a
chronic lack of food and consumer goods.
   Although Gorbachev's reported salary far exceeds the average wage
of about $350 a month, it couldn't begin to pay for the many
privileges afforded the top Soviet leadership.
   Members of the elite have limousines, special food packages,
access to special stores, summer homes, special schools and camps
for their children and other perquisites that set them apart from
typical citizens.
   While ordinary Soviets wait in long lines for items such as
coffee, detergent, fruit, vegetables and chocolate, the elite can
have such things delivered or pick them up at stores that are
off-limits to average citizens.
   Kremlin leaders and their families also are assigned apartments
that are deluxe and spacious by Soviet standards.
   Such privileges occasionally have been challenged, most recently
at the national Communist Party conference in July by Boris N.
Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow party boss who was entitled to them as a
member of the ruling Politburo. In an address to the conference,
Yeltsin, who still retains some popular support despite losing his
influential posts, called for abolition of special privileges for
the elite.
   ``If there are some shortages in our socialist society, then
everybody should share the same shortage,'' he said. ``We must do
away with elitism, eliminate the word `spets' (special) from our
vocabulary.''
   Gorbachev later said in a televised discussion with conference
delegates that ``we should take a look'' at party privileges because
there are so many popular complaints about them.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is postponing hard economic
choices at home while seeking to finance reforms through loans from
the West, says the author of a new book on the Soviet economy.
   Author Judy Shelton joins a chorus of skeptics, including many on
Capitol Hill, who are urging the new Bush administration to forge a
coherent policy in the West to review the strategic implications of
lending to the Soviet bloc.
   Shelton's new book, ``The Coming Soviet Crash: Gorbachev's
Desperate Pursuit of Credit in Western Financial Markets,''
concludes that Soviet accountants have been fudging the country's
economic figures for years, steadily reporting budget surpluses when
there were actually growing deficits.
   The Soviets finally admitted to a budget deficit last October,
although one respected Soviet economist has said the deficit is
three times higher than the Kremlin acknowledged.
   The issue has aroused concern among members of Congress,
including Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who has cautioned that giving
the Kremlin easy credits could undercut U.S. interests and harm,
rather than help, the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The West has been slow to respond, wrote Shelton. ``Gorbachev's
onslaught of financial maneuvers seems to have left the United
States dazed.''
   Under Gorbachev, the Kremlin has turned increasingly to the West
for financing, increasing commercial borrowing by half and securing
lines of guaranteed credit from Western governments worth $7
billion, she said.
   As part of the reforms, the Soviets are publishing many
previously secret economic statistics, although Shelton and others
question the data.
   Last August, in a prospectus for its first foreign bond issue,
the Soviet government said it had a budget surplus, putting the
figure at 3 billion rubles, or $1.8 billion.
   ``It was revealed three months later that the Soviets had been
running a deficit for years,'' Shelton said. The revelation, she
said, did not prompt a protest from the Swiss bank that sponsored
the loan or from those who bought the issue.
   Shelton said the continued cloudiness of Soviet financial figures
does not augur well for the West as the Soviets seek to join such
Western financial institutions as the International Monetary Fund,
World Bank and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, which
require reporting in which no numbers are hidden.
   Although the Soviet Union has increased its international
borrowing, the credits do not come close to covering the deficit,
and the Kremlin has simply printed more money to cover the gap, she
wrote.
   Gorbachev has backed away from one of the toughest political
decisions facing him, and has maintained subsidies and controls for
prices of key commoditities, Shelton said in a Capitol Hill
presentation this week.
   For the West, the greatest concern is that the Soviets are
borrowing money abroad while postponing tough political decisions at
home.
   ``The correlation between Gorbachev's reign in the Kremlin and
the escalation of Soviet borrowing activities in Western financial
markets is striking,'' wrote Shelton, a researcher at the Hoover
Institution of Stanford University.
   ``Within two years after Gorbachev took power in March 1985,
Soviet debt to the West shot up from about $25 billion to over $37
billion, an increase of 50 percent,'' she wrote.
   Bradley, in a New York Times column on Jan. 6, cautioned that
``the notion that Western governments can help Mr. Gorbachev through
cheap credit is ... flawed.''
   ``Reform means making tough choices _ butter not weapons,
efficiency not useless output, consumption not forced saving. The
real reformers know this. They also know it means higher prices,
less job security and harder work today in exchange for the promise
of a better life tomorrow,'' Bradley said.
   Continuing shortages of basic goods and revelations about the
Soviet budget deficit have tempered optimism about that better life.
   Soviet Finance Minister Boris I. Gostev last October estimated
the budget deficit at 35 billion rubles, about $58 billion at
current exchange rates.
   Another well-known Soviet economist, Leonid Abalkin, last week
said that the actual deficit was nearly three times Gostev's
estimate, about $165 billion, or 11 percent of the gross national
product. By comparison, the U.S. government deficit runs at about 4
percent of GNP.
   Other Soviet officials have been more optimistic. Mikhail
Korolev, chairman of the State Committee for Statistics, wrote in
Pravda on Monday that the GNP grew 5 percent last year and was 13.3
percent higher than in 1985.
   The government announced this month that Soviet GNP in 1988
totaled 866 billion rubles, or $1.4 trillion. That was less than
half of the 1985 U.S. GNP of $3.8 trillion.

   A bitter wind whipped the flags at half staff
Wednesday as people at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base mourned the deaths
of 17 colleagues.
   ``That's eerie, to see that flag,'' said an airman at the
northern Michigan installation. ``It's even worse to see the
families (of the victims) coming in.''
   A military refueling plane that left Sawyer on Monday crashed and
exploded Tuesday as it tried to take off from Dyess Air Force Base
near Abilene, Texas. All 19 aboard died.
   It was the third fiery crash since October involving planes
originating from Sawyer, one of the Air Force's northern tier posts
by Lake Superior.
   ``We're dealing with a base that has gone through three tragedies
in four months,'' said Capt. Paul Bicking, a Sawyer spokesman.
``I've heard different comments, such as trouble comes in threes and
now that we've had our three, we've had our trouble for awhile.''
   The 26-year-old KC-135 tanker that crashed in Texas on Tuesday
carried 17 people from the Sawyer area, along with two passengers
who boarded at Dyess.
   The plane was to escort and refuel four F-16 jets from Carswell
Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas, and land at Hawaii before
reaching its principal destination, Andersen Air Force Base in Guam,
Bicking said.
   Seven of the dead were members of the plane's flight and
maintenance crews from Sawyer. Air Force officials said the rest
included four civilian relatives of military personnel and four
military retirees who were taking advantage of the military's policy
of allowing them to hop overseas flights when there is space on
board.
   ``It's another plane crash,'' said Marquette resident George
Smith, sipping coffee at a local diner. ``It seems like they happen
every day now.''
   Sawyer continued routine operations Wednesday, but the close-knit
base closed ranks and effectively shut out outsiders.
   ``Our family is going through the process of mourning. We're
caring for our people,'' said the base wing commander, Col. Eldon
Joersz, in a very terse meeting with the press. He walked out
without answering questions.
   ``They're pretty devastated. We want to regroup,'' said another
base spokesman, Sgt. Joseph Butera.
   Memorial services at the base chapel were planned for Friday.
   The tension contrasted with the fortunate feeling at Sawyer
following the Dec. 6 explosion of a B-52 bomber as it went through a
touch-and-go landing on the base's main runway. All eight crew
members survived in what base personnel called a miracle.
   Three months earlier, 10 Sawyer personnel had survived the Oct.
11 crash of a KC-135 that killed six people from a sister Michigan
base.

<HEAD>Panama Canal Officials Say They Were Roughed Up By U.S. Soldiers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Panamanian officials said they
were struck and threatened with a pistol by two U.S. military
policemen near the Panama Canal.
   A U.S. Army spokesman denied the charges but said there was
pushing and shoving between the Panamanians and the Americans.
   Jorge Luis de Leon and Miguel Tejada, officials with the Panama
Canal Commission, told a news conference on Tuesday they were
victims of ``brutal aggression'' by two military police officers
stationed with the U.S. Southern Command.
   They said they were detained Monday as they were traveling along
the Panama Canal near Gamboa.
   De Leon told reporters he was hit by the police officers. Tejada
said one officers threatened him with a 9mm pistol.
   William Ormsbee, a Southern Command spokesman, said the
Panamanians were interrogated by military police for a ``violation
of rules concerning the control of smuggled goods.''
   Ormsbee said de Leon, 39, and Tejada, 38, tried to enter an army
supply store to which only de Leon had limited access privileges. De
Leon has dual Panamanian-U.S. citizenship, he said.
   De Leon became violent when the military police officers
prevented the Panamanians from entering, Ormsbee said. Both were
questioned and released, he said.
   De Leon and Tejada did not comment on the allegation that they
were trying to enter the store.
   The Panama Canal Commission is charged with supervising the
operations of the Panama Canal. The United States is to turn over
control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   The Southern Command oversees all U.S. military operations in
Latin America.
   Relations have soured in the past year. The United States has
demanded the resignation of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander
of Panama's Defense Forces and de facto ruler of the country.
   Noriega is under U.S. indictment for drug trafficking and money
laundering. He denies the charges and says the United States is
seeking a pretext to renege on its pledge to turn over the canal.

<HEAD>Overhaul of U.S. Foreign Aid Program is Proposed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congresional task force on Wednesday proposed
a radical revamping of the U.S. foreign aid program, saying the
current system has become too diluted, haphazard and bureaucratized
to meet its goals.
   Since the United States entered the foreign aid arena with the
Marshall Plan for Europe after World War II, the program has grown
more complex, global realities have changed and America has lost its
position as the world's most charitable nation, said the report to
the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``U.S. foreign assistance needs a new premise, a new framework
and a new purpose to meet the challenges of today,'' said the
report, presented to committee members in a closed-door meeting.
``It is time to start anew.''
   The task force, led by Reps. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and Benjamin
Gilman, R-N.Y., recommended repeal of the basic foreign aid law
passed 28 years ago, which it said has grown cumbersome and
inconsistent.
   It called instead for a new ``International Economic Cooperation
Act of 1989'' which would more narrowly define the goals of U.S. aid
to other countries and aim American help at encouraging broad-based
economic growth in Third World countries and alleviating poverty
while encouraging political freedom and environmental protection.
   The recommendations would sharply curb the use of ``earmarks,''
the instructions by Congress spelling out precisely which countries
and programs are to receive money, and how much. The practice has
grown to the point where nearly all military and economic aid money
is earmarked, and half of development funds, leaving little
flexibility to those who administer the programs.
   Kathleen Mazzocco, a spokeswoman for the non-profit Population
Crisis Committee, said her group's population control activities
were typical of the kinds of programs that are politically
vulnerable and could suffer if protective earmarks are eliminated.
   ``There will be constant warfare and conflict, no collegiality
among the competing groups,'' she said. In addition to family
planning efforts, agriculture and health programs are also likely to
be vulnerable to cuts, she said.
   Hamilton had hinted at some of the new directions in an article
in the February issue of the Foreign Service Journal, in which he
said ``our current program suffers from too great a concentration on
the Middle East, too much emphasis on military sales ... and too
great an emphasis on immediate political objectives.''
   In the current fiscal year, Israel and Egypt will recieve half of
the total $15 billion U.S. aid budget, with another large slice
going to other strategically important allies such as Pakistan,
Turkey, the Philippines, El Salvador and Greece. Relatively little
is left for Africa and others among the world's poorest countries.
   In inflation-adjusted dollars, this year's aid total is the same
as Americans spent in 1977, and represents an all-time low for the
United States as a percentage of its gross national product. For the
first time this year, Japan is surpassing the United States as the
world's largest donor country.
   The report's authors hope it will be the framework for
construction of this year's foreign aid legislation, but they
acknowledge their approach will be a hard sell. Foreign aid is among
the least-popular government programs, and budget constraints mean
it will be under an even greater than usual squeeze this time.
   ``As the pie shrinks, members of Congress, interest groups,
departments and agencies will each fight to protect their particular
interest,'' the report stated. ``In sum, the United States will have
to do more with available resources.''
   Under the new system, aid programs would be evaluated by how well
they achieve their goals, rather than focusing on heavy accounting
and reporting requirements that have turned aid programs into a
bureaucratic nightmare, the task force said.
   The act would establish a new Economic Cooperation Agency to
administer its programs as the successor to the Agency for
International Development, which now handles that task.

   House and Senate negotiators forged ahead
Wednesday with separate but similar proposals to bar speaking fees
and restrict other outside income should a 50 percent congressional
pay raise become law Feb. 8.
   A bipartisan draft document, given out to senators and obtained
by The Associated Press, compares the latest House and Senate
proposals on outside income.
   Both packages would ban honoraria, including fees for speeches,
appearances and articles, upon enactment of the raise that would
boost congressional salaries from $89,500 to $135,000.
   Leaders in both houses have made clear that honoraria would
continue if the pay raise is defeated because members don't want to
suffer a loss of income. Rank-and-file House members currently can
retain $26,850 and Senate members $35,800 in honoraria.
   The Senate plan includes a contingency that would permit
retention of some honoraria if the raise is eventually scaled back.
The pay plan now before Congress can only be defeated if both houses
reject it. The Senate is virtually certain to turn the raise down,
but the question of whether the House will vote on it depends on a
survey of members' intentions ordered by Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Under the honoraria proposals, both houses would permit such fees
to be donated to charity on a member's behalf. The Senate plan would
limit the donation to $2,000 per appearance and require members to
list on financial disclosure forms the amount, the payer and the
recipient of the donation.
   The House and Senate plans would allow groups that invite members
to an event to continue paying for travel. The Senate would direct
its ethics committee to issue rules and regulations defining
acceptable limits.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., has told reporters
there would likely be a time restriction on House members' travel,
with exceptions made for multi-day events.
   The House draft would prohibit members from receiving any pension
benefits from honoraria given as a charitable donation. The Senate
plan would go further, prohibiting conversion of any of the
donations to a member's personal use.
   The House plan would limit all outside earned income to 15
percent of a member's salary, half the current 30 percent.
   The House also would end a provision in federal law that has
allowed 190 House members, in office before 1980, to accumulate $39
million in campaign funds that could be converted to personal use.
The measure would become effective in January 1991, giving House
members one chance to retire with the money.
   The Senate already has a rule prohibiting such conversion.
   The House proposal would incorporate restrictions on members that
already exist under Senate rules.
   The restrictions include a ban on affiliating with business
entities for compensation, a prohibition on practicing a profession
except part-time teaching, and a ban on serving as an officer or
board member on a publicly held or regulated corporation.
   Wright and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,
have promised that honoraria packages will be taken up immediately
if the pay raise becomes law next Wednesday.

<HEAD>Investigation Launched Into Allegations of Mass Grave</HEAD>

   Authorities are probing allegations that
Kurdish guerrillas were buried in a mass grave near the garbage dump
of a southeastern city, the local prosecutor said Wednesday.
   Mustafa Erdogdu said in a telephone interview that a preliminary
investigation is checking allegations published in the Sunday
edition of the leftist weekly 2000ne Dogru (Toward 2000). He did not
elaborate.
   The weekly reported that Kurdish guerrillas killed in shootouts
with security forces, as well as suspects who died in custody, were
buried in a mass grave near the city of Siirt.
   ``The Siirt garbage dump is full of bodies,'' the magazine quoted
Zubeyir Aydar, a lawyer and the former local chief of the main
opposition Social Democrat Populist Party, as saying.
   Kurds comprise an estimated one-fifth of Turkey's 55 million
people. Kurdish guerrillas, members of the Marxist Kurdish Labor
Party, have been fighting government forces in southeast Turkey
since 1984 to set up an independent state, leaving hundreds of
people dead.
   The magazine quoted Bedria Akan, whose son Hasan Akar died in
detention in April 1985, as saying his body was never given to the
family, and she heard rumors it was dumped in the alleged mass grave.
   The report said relatives of missing people in the city had been
demanding that officials dig open the riverbed. It did not say how
many people were missing.
   The weekly said Hayrettin Kozakcioglu, the regional governor for
the southeast provinces, acknowledged that three Kurdish guerrillas,
killed in a shootout last February, were buried near the site when
nobody claimed the bodies.
   ``I have no other knowledge,'' it quoted the governor as saying.
   The governor could not be reached by phone to comment on the
report. officials in Ankara, Turkey's capital, also had no comment.
   Last month, authorities arrested 400 people suspected of aiding
the guerrillas. Opposition parties charged that some of the suspects
were mistreated and a few were forced to eat human excrement. Local
authorities denied the charges.
   Kurds also populate portions of Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Soviet
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Kurdish rebels have also fought
for autonomy in northeastern Iraq.

<HEAD>Warring Factions Fail to Compromise at Communist Meeting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A marathon debate of the Communist
Party's deeply divided Central Committee ended Wednesday with no
compromise and a stern call for the party to adopt reforms.
   ``We are divided on fundamental questions,'' committee member
Josip Vrhovec said late Tuesday. The split was so bad, he said, ``we
already have two different, clearly ideologically defined parties.''
   The first and most important part of Wednesday's meeting ended
with a speech by national party chief Stipe Suvar, who quashed
attempts to oust him by Serbian and other conservatives.
   But the session continued with a laborious discussion of
personnel issues, focusing on Azem Vlasi, a former party chief in
restive Kosovo province.
   The only agreement reached was that the party hold an emergency
congress before the end of this year to try again to overcome the
rift in the leadership over economic and political targets.
   The three-day meeting was marked by verbal clashes between
liberals advocating greater political pluralism and more democracy
and conservatives seeking greater central party control to overcome
Yugoslavia's worst crisis.
   Suvar said the choice facing the country is one of an open market
or a state-controlled one, ``between a state based on the rule of
law or the revolutionary one,'' and between political pluralism or
domination of a single doctrine.
   He urged members to create a political climate for the party to
implement ``the reforms necessary to overcome the difficult
situation in the country and to enable the Communist Party to stop
losing battle after battle.''
   Suvar referred to a statement by Adm. Petar Simic, political
chief of the armed forces, who warned Monday the party is ``losing
battle after battle.''
   ``What some describe as the battle for Yugoslavia will not be
waged without the Yugoslav army,'' Simic said.
   The session also was marked by a sharp clash and heated exchanges
over Suvar's sentiments toward Serbia between the national party
chief's political allies, mainly from the liberal northern republics
of Slovenia and Croatia, and supporters of hard-line Serbian party
chief Slobodan Milosevic.
   Suvar described as ``pure fabrication'' accusations that he is
biased against Serbian interests.
   Apparently referring to Serbian hard-liners, he said: ``We have
to overcome the quarrelsome and intolerant thinking that only one
truth exists and that all other opinions must be defeated.''
   Suvar also has drawn strong support from the central republic of
Bosnia and southern Macedonia region, as well as from some delegates
of Kosovo, where Albanians are a majority.
   ``We don't have time for compromises,'' said Ali Sabani, an
ethnic Albanian. ``A battle is being waged to liquidate this Central
Committee, the Presidium (Politburo) and its president, according to
a well-known scenario.
   ``The same scenario would then be used on the (federal state)
presidency,'' Sabani said in clear reference to Milosevic and his
alleged ambitions in national politics.
   Conversely, a Serbian speaker asked, ``Can this leadership take
us out of the crisis?''
   The final decision was left to the 23-member ruling Politburo,
but it is highly unlikely it will relieve Suvar before his term
expires in June.
   The next scheduled party congress is to take place in 1990. The
extraordinary congress is to take place at an unspecified date later
this year.

<DATELINE>LUMBERTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after being taken hostage by two
shotgun-wielding Indians, the staff of The Robesonian made jokes and
fielded crank calls as they worked to get the newspaper out, their
editor said Wednesday.
   ``We thought there might be some crank calls, and there were,''
Bob Horne said. ``People called up and said `Happy Feb. 1,' or
`Happy Anniversary.' Nothing too serious.''
   A year ago Wednesday, Tuscarora Indians Eddie Hatcher and Timothy
Jacobs held up to 20 staff members hostage for 10 hours while airing
charges that local officials were involved in drug trafficking. The
siege ended when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to form a task force to
investigate the charges.
   Both Indians were found innocent of federal hostage-taking and
firearms violations in October, but now each faces 14 state charges
of kidnapping. Hatcher is seeking refuge with the Shoshone-Bannock
Indians in Idaho, while Jacobs is awaiting an extradition hearing
later this month in New York.
   Horne said the scene in the newsroom was much different from last
year, when some terrorized staffers feared for their lives after
being posted as human shields in doorways.
   ``There's been some joking today about the incident, which I
thought was positive _ that people could joke about it,'' he said.
   Horne said the newspaper noted the anniversary with a long story
interviewing leaders from the county's black, Indian and white
communities about changes that have taken place in the last year.
   The takeover, and the fatal shooting of Indian judicial candidate
Julian Pierce a month later, resulted in the establishment of a
human relations council for the county, a public defender's office
and a second Superior Court judgeship that Martin filled with an
Indian lawyer.
   Jacobs and Hatcher on Tuesday sued Martin, state Attorney General
Lacy Thornburg and 18 other state and county officials. The lawsuit
asks a federal judge to block their extradition and prosecution on
the kidnapping charges because their civil rights have been violated.
   Thornburg said Tuesday the state will press for the extradition
and prosecution of the men despite the lawsuit.
   The U.S. Attorney's Office in Raleigh has issued a federal
warrant for Hatcher charging him with unlawful flight from
prosecution. Gloria Dupree, a spokeswoman for the office, said
Wednesday that the warrant issued Monday would allow federal agents
to arrest Hatcher and return him to North Carolina to face the
kidnapping charges.
   An FBI spokesman in Charlotte said whether FBI agents could go on
the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho to arrest Hatcher would depend on
local arrangements with the reservation.
   ``Some reservations have asked the federal government to act as a
policing authority on the reservation,'' the spokesman said. ``Some
reservations have said `No, we want to do it ourselves.'

<TEXT>
   The government will let the United States test an
unarmed version of a highly advanced cruise missile over western
Canada, the defense minister said Wednesday.
   The missile will fly from the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic, across
northeastern British Columbia and over northern Alberta to a
military weapons range on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border.
   The missile, known as the AGM-129A, is more advanced than other
U.S. air-launched cruise missiles tested over Canada since 1983.
   The low-flying, cigar-shaped weapon, which uses the stealth
technology being applied to other U.S. defense systems, is better
able to avoid radar detection, officials say.
   Defense Minister Bill McKnight said the missile test is expected
to be conducted before March 31.
   The cruise missile tests have been controversial in Canada since
they began. Opponents of the test argue that the missile could be
used as a first-strike weapon. Supporters say it is a deterrent.
   The defense minister said the Warsaw Pact already has a
significant and improving cruise missile capability.
   ``We support the pursuit of mutual arms reduction, a process that
can only move ahead effectively if both sides are dealing from
equivalent positions,'' McKnight said.
   The missile is capable of carrying conventional or nuclear
warheads.

<HEAD>Legislation Would Cut Global Warming by Limiting Fuel Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation designed to reduce fossil-fuel
pollutants that scientists say are creating the ``greenhouse
effect,'' or global warming trend, was unveiled Wednesday by Sen.
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.
   Wirth said the measure would set strict goals to reduce certain
gases, such as carbon dioxide, that prevent heat rays from escaping
the Earth's atmosphere, thus raising global temperatures.
   ``The policy we are proposing today would have other economic
benefits _ reducing oil imports, for example, and alleviating the
U.S. trade deficit,'' said Wirth, a member of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee.
   The bill proposes studying ways to power automobiles and other
motor vehicles with natural gas instead of the dirtier-burning
gasoline and diesel.
   The bill, supported by a bipartisan group of 21 senators, also
calls for reducing U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent by
the end of the century by developing a national energy policy that
stresses energy conservation and promotes the development of
alternative and renewable energy sources.
   It addition, it calls for convening an international conference
to adopt a binding climate-protection convention that would cut
global emissions of carbon dioxide by 50 percent by the year 2015.

   Below-zero temperatures in February are not in
themselves big news in the Plains, but residents found the 70-degree
drops in temperatures bracing and farmers found them worrying.
   ``Hot chocolate, hot coffee, donuts and hot dogs, anything that's
hot'' sold big Wednesday at Sapp Bros.-Sidney truck stop in western
Nebraska, said its manager, Mike Machamer.
   Business was up about 20 percent as people came in from the cold,
Mike Machamer said. But no one appeared to be stranded, he said.
   Police expected to give more people rides to shelters as the
homeless try to get off the street, Capt. William Crawford said. And
the Cornhusker Motor Club had a rush of 112 calls from motorists in
the Omaha area Wednesday morning _ 70 percent more than the previous
day, most wanting jump starts, said Rose White, public affairs
director of the AAA motor club.
   Farmers and ranchers faced particular problems, as the
temperature plunge endangered both crops and animals.
   ``It's a shock to anything's system when you have a 100-degree
drop in (wind-chill) temperature,'' said Tom Scott, executive
director of the Nebraska Beef Industry Development Board.
   Barb Rishel of North Platte said her husband, Bill, went to their
ranch south of town Tuesday night to be sure the herd bulls were
properly bedded down and to keep an eye on cows that were calving.
Sheds, straw and heat lamps are used for newborns and their mothers,
Mrs. Rishel said.
   The cold wind had winter wheat growers worried.
   ``The thing that would concern us most is the lack of snow cover,
and then the second part that concerns us is the sudden change in
temperature,'' said Steve Baenziger of the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln agronomy department.
   ``Normally when we have these kinds of temperatures, ... the crop
gets used to being cold,'' he said. ``Now, we've got something
that's unbelieveable _ record highs, and suddenly within one day we
go to cold temperatures.''

   The United States, at the request of the United
Nations, has sent a small team of military experts to teach Afghan
rebels and refugees how to clear land mines, officials said
Wednesday.
   The U.S. team, consisting of about 30 trainers and support staff,
has been sent to Pakistan and will work with Afghan rebels and
refugees in camps on the Pakistani side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan
border, the officials said.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said acting
Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV authorized the deployment ``at
the request of the United Nations' coordinator for humanitarian and
economic assistance programs.
   ``The Defense Department team consists of about 30 military
personnel who will remain in Pakistan for about six months in
support of a U.N. command structure,'' Schneider continued.
   ``The team is to instruct Afghan refugees in mine awareness and
mine-clearing techniques. U.S. military personnel will not be
permitted to enter Afghanistan, and all training activity will be
conducted in Pakistan.''
   Schneider said the American team consisted of Green Berets from
the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell,
Ky.
   The disclosure of the deployment came as the State Department
accused the Soviet Union on Wednesday of continuing widespread
bombing attacks inside Afghanistan. Spokesman Charles Redman charged
that ``unprecedented destruction'' has occurred as Soviet troops
withdraw.
   The Soviet Union has agreed under a U.N.-sponsored settlement to
withdraw all of its troops by Feb. 15. Soviet troops invaded
Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up a Marxist government and have been
fighting the Mujahedeen resistance ever since.
   According to the Pentagon, the Soviets have scattered an 10
million to 30 million mines across the country during the past nine
years. United Nations officials are now concerned that thousands of
Afghan refugees will return to their country after the Soviet
withdrawal without realizing the scope of the mine threat.
   ``The training program designed for the refugees is intended to
make the refugees aware of the threat and to provide a cadre of
Afghan refugees trained in mine-clearing,'' Schneider said Wednesday.
   The spokesman added the United Nations had designated the effort
``Operation Salam,'' but the Pentagon is calling its contribution
``Operation Safe Passage.''

   Police on Wednesday arrested three
village chiefs in southern Abeokuta state after villagers refused to
hand over the corpse of a slain lawman.
   Police threatened to attack the towns of of Loti, Luwaji and
Ogbere on Tuesday, and most of the villagers fled. On Wednesday,
officers surrounded the towns and arrested the chiefs of each.
   The arrests came one week after three policemen were attacked in
the area while chasing a man suspected of receiving stolen goods.
The bodies of two of them, Inspector Adisa Obawunmi and Constable
Johnson Akinfenwa, were found in a shallow grave.
   Sgt. James Olayinka remained missing. On Tuesday, Abeokuta Police
Commissioner Vincent Ugwumba said: ``So far not a goat or a hut in
the villages has been destroyed. But if we don't see the corpse we
will let our men loose.''
   Police have arrested 28 people from the villages, about 45 miles
northwest of Lagos.
   He said people from the same villages in 1965 killed 35 policemen
whose corpses were never found.

<HEAD>New AIDS Aerosol Drug Could Help Tens of Thousands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of AIDS patients could be
helped by an experimental drug soon to be approved in aerosol form
by the Food and Drug Administration, AIDS activists said Wednesday.
   The drug, pentamidine, is believed to have some effect in
preventing pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which causes an estimated
60 percent of AIDS deaths.
   ``It is a dramatic breakthrough in terms of offering a preventive
treatment for the most deadly'' infections that strike people whose
immune systems have been depleted by AIDS, said Jeffrey Levi,
executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
   FDA approval of widespread distribution of the aerosol drug is
``imminent,'' FDA spokesman Donald McLearn said.
   The FDA would not say how many people it expected would have
access to the drug, but Levi estimated ``tens of thousands of people
would be eligible.''
   Pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable
drug. The spray version under FDA review would make it easier to
take into the lungs where pneumocystis first shows up.
   The FDA decision would be in a special category that allows
widespread distribution of promising drugs before they are approved
for commercial distribution. Normally, the government requires years
of studies before permitting general use of a drug.
   Until a drug receives full approval, its use normally is not
covered by government or private health insurance policies. Often
during experimental use of a drug, the manufacturer distributes it
free to patients.
   LyphoMed Inc. of Rosemont, Ill., the leading supplier of
injectable pentamidine and the company expected to be licensed to
supply the aerosol version, said it would release information about
its plans for the drug next week.
   AIDS activists have complained that the government has moved too
slowly in permitting the use of promising drugs for people who have
the AIDS virus. However, activists praised the FDA action, which is
expected next week.
   ``It's quite important as a symbol, an example of the FDA moving
faster than it has in the past,'' said Thomas Hannon, associate
director of the New York Community Research Initiative, which
conducted one of the studies on the aerosol form of pentamidine.
   ``They've talked a lot about a faster approval process for drugs
for life-threatening diseases like cancer and AIDS, and this is
encouraging,'' he said.
   Levi said, ``It's an indication that the process is working
better.''
   But he added, ``People are cautious because they don't know how
the drug will be available and the conditions'' FDA will place on
its use.
   Not all AIDS activists, however, praised the FDA's work on
pentamidine.
   ``This should have been fully approved by now,'' said Mark
Harrington of a New York-based group called AIDS Coalition to
Unleash Power.
   About 50 members of the group rode a bus to Bethesda, Md., on
Wednesday to attend a meeting of a government panel that is studying
ways to reduce approval time for AIDS and cancer drugs.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The chief
victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
abusers.
   The Federal Centers for Disease Control said that as of Jan. 30,
84,985 AIDS cases had been reported in America. More than half,
48,582, have died. There have been 2,228 new cases reported since
Jan. 1, the CDC said.

   A 71-year-old woman who maintains a
ramshackle homestead at an undeveloped state park has sued the state
in an effort to prevent her eviction.
   In the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Derby Superior Court, attorney
John Williams said the eviction of Doris Gagnon would be unnecessary
and would shorten her life.
   ``I personally feel if they take her out of there and demolish
that little compound she has put together and put her in a nursing
home, she won't live very long,'' Williams said.
   Williams is seeking an injunction preventing the state from
trying to evict Gagnon, who has cancer, for five years or for the
rest of her life, whichever is shorter.
   Williams said he decided on a five-year time limit because it
would take the state at least that long to come up with funds to
develop the park, on land along Long Island Sound.
   Leslie Carothers, the state's commissioner of environmental
protection, said she had no comment because she hadn't read
Williams' suit. Carothers' department is pursuing eviction of Gagnon.
   Gagnon's homestead is near the site of her former home, which the
state condemned and demolished in 1971 to make way for the park. She
has lived since in a makeshift compound that includes a trailer and
coops where she keeps chickens.
   State authorities servied notice in November that they wanted her
off the land after receiving a complaint from Milford health
officials that her presence represented a nuisance to the public
health.
   During a summer inspection of the property, health officials said
they found bags of human sewage piled up behind her living quarters.
The homestead is served by no public utilities.
   State officials said they also took action at this time because
development work is expected to begin this summer and they want to
avoid delays.

<HEAD>Bush Urged Not To Make Hasty Decision on U.S.-Japanese Fighter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of top-level U.S.-Japanese talks,
five senators on Wednesday urged President Bush to conduct a
complete review of a pending deal under which Japan would receive $8
billion in advanced aircraft technology.
   In a letter to Bush, the senators said the deal involving the FSX
fighter raises serious questions about its ``long-term impact on the
health and competitiveness of the American aerospace industry.''
   Sending the letter were Sens. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Alan Dixon,
D-Ill.; Wendell Ford, D-Ky.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; and Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska.
   They noted that during the visit of Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita on Thursday and Friday there likely will be
``intense pressure ... to give the full commitment of the president
to the program.''
   ``However, to do so without a full assessment of the program's
long-term impact would not be in the best interests of the United
States,'' the senators told Bush.
   Under the proposed deal, Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
would develop and produce a new-generation Japanese fighter using
technology for the U.S. F-16 fighter obtained from General Dynamics,
which would serve as a subcontractor to Mitsubishi.
   This ``co-development'' effort would be in lieu of directly
purchasing fighters from the United States or manufacturing them
under U.S. license.
   Critics of the deal contend it would delay strengthening of
Japan's defense forces, due to time needed to design and build the
FSX, and go too far in furthering development of the Japanese
aircraft industry in competition with the United States.
   In their letter to Bush, the senators complained that
negotiations over the FSX have been carried out by the State
Department and Pentagon without involvement of the U.S. Trade
Representative and the Commerce Department.
   ``We are requesting that you order a complete review of the FSX
program within the administration, including the departments of
Commerce, Labor and Energy, as well as the Office of the Trade
Representative and the White House science office,'' the letter said.
   It added: ``We hope that your administration will refrain from
any further commitments on the FSX until that review has been
completed and the Congress has been fully consulted.''
   During his confirmation hearings last week, Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower told senators he would review the
agreement, negotiated during the Reagan administration.
   At the State Department, officials said a review was currently in
progress, after which the department hoped to proceed on the
arrangement by giving Congress the required 30-day formal notice in
which to object to the technology transfer.

   Nine more potential jurors were picked
Wednesday for Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial in a laborious effort
interrupted by the judge's threat to hold a TV reporter in contempt
for making jury selection even tougher.
   So far, there are 16 people in the pool of prospects from which
12 jurors and six alternates eventually will be chosen. The judge in
the case said at day's end he hoped the jury could be selected
Monday.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell angrily said he was
considering holding ABC News correspondent Tim O'Brien in contempt
of court. He said an ABC account Tuesday night ``appears to be a
deliberate effort to obstruct'' jury selection by airing
congressional testimony North had given covering the same subjects
on which he now faces charges.
   The judge's comments showed continuing concern about the
difficulty of picking jurors unfamiliar North's previous testimony
about the Iran-Contra affair. He testified in nationally televised
congressional hearings in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity
from prosecution.
   North himself has steered clear of public comments going into and
out of the courthouse. However, he cracked a few jokes about the
trial in remarks to a religious group at a breakfast early Tuesday.
   He said he could stay only a few minutes because ``I have an
appearance elsewhere that I have been invited to.'' Then he said,
``Normally in order to speak, I have to have a subpoena.''
   Before jury selection resumed after lunch, North signed several
autographs for an admirer in the courtroom, then gave him a friendly
slap on the shoulder.
   The 12 felony charges against North include lying to Congress and
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III about his role in the
Iran-Contra affair and illegally using a tax-exempt foundation to
help finance a ``secret war'' against Nicaragua's Sandinista
government.
   ``It seemed like the whole world was talking about that
testimony,'' defense lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said in court,
trying to probe a prospective juror's knowledge of North's public
admissions two years ago that he lied and destroyed National
Security Council documents.
   Gesell excused three prospective jurors who said they had seen
North's congressional testimony, including a department store clerk
who acknowledged that she ``heard something'' about North shredding
documents on one of the dozens of TV sets displayed where she worked.
   But the judge brushed aside defense objections to inclusion of
others, notably a hospital laboratory technician who said she had
seen North on television but couldn't ``remember anything he said.''
   ``Usually I turned the channel'' to another program, she said.
   North lawyer Barry Sullivan urged the judge to abide ``by the
principle that no juror be seated who saw Col. North testify.''
   But Gesell said, ``I have to take into account your client was on
TV a great deal under all kinds of circumstances. She did say she
saw him but she did not say she heard him.''
   Another chosen for the jury pool, a mental health administrator
who has testified dozens of times in court, said she hadn't paid
much attention to North's testimony because she had just changed
jobs.
   Simon objected to her selection, calling her ``almost a
professional witness.'' He also said she received newspapers at her
home that delved into North's testimony with such prominent
headlines that she ``could not miss critical portions of his
testimony.''
   At the start of the second day of jury selection, Gesell said he
had ``not made up my mind'' but was considering whether O'Brien's
account of Tuesday's proceeding provided an ``appropriate basis for
a contempt action.''
   The judge said O'Brien, who was not in court during Gesell's
remarks but was there later, ``took pains'' to tell viewers that if
they watched the excerpts of North's congressional testimony they
would not have to serve on the jury.
   Roone Arledge, president of ABC News, said in a statement
distributed in New York: ``Correspondent Tim O'Brien reported fairly
and accurately what has been said in public regarding the North
case. The public's right to be informed need not conflict with the
fair administration of justice. Last night's `World News Tonight'
segment informed our viewers about events already having taken place
in public arenas. They cannot now be erased.''
   North's admissions to Congress cannot be used against him as
evidence, and Gesell has ruled that no one who heard the former
National Security Council aide's congressional testimony could sit
on the jury.
   The judge plans to pick a panel of 50 prospective jurors before
allowing prosecutors and defense attorneys to exercise an as-yet
unspecified number of peremptory challenges. Seven were picked
Tuesday. At the end of Wednesday's session, Gesell said questioning
had ``gone very well'' and he hoped to ``move for jury selection on
Monday.''
   Defense lawyers for the retired Marine lieutenant colonel did not
object to seating an Army sergeant who served from 1963 to 1978, had
a top secret security clearance and was in Vietnam during the Tet
offensive.
   The man now works in a security job and said he didn't recognize
North, a decorated fellow veteran of the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>Government Claims Foreign Plot Against Greece</HEAD>

   The government said Wednesday it has been
the target of foreign secret service plots to destabilize democracy.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos commented on a
pro-government newspaper report that recent scandals were a plot by
the CIA to undermine Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou, whose
government is driving a hard bargain in talks on a new U.S. bases
treaty.
   ``Greece has certainly been the target of foreign and domestic
circles,'' Kostopoulos said at his daily press briefing. He did not
elaborate.
   The Avriani newspaper alleged that the CIA and the Mafia are
orchestrating a plan to slander slander Papandreou so that ``the
removal of the American bases by 1999 will not be realized.''
   ``Americans don't like him since he is not a yes-man,'' it said.
   The U.S. Embassy refused comment.
   The United States is negotiating a new military bases agreement
with the Greek government after an agreement expired in December.
Thirteen rounds of talks have failed to resolve the major issues,
and another round is scheduled next month to determine whether four
major installations remain or are closed down.
   Avriani said the alleged plot was based on the CIA Psychological
Warfare Manual and involved using the political opposition and the
press to slander the premier and to implicate government officials
in scandals and crimes.
   Multimillion-dollar financial and arms scandals have plagued the
Socialist government for months and have caused the resignation of
seven Cabinet members since November.
   The entire political opposition has called for Papandreou's
resignation so early general elections could be held before the
government's term is up in June. The prime minister has refused to
step down and described the scandals reported by most of the daily
press as slanderous.
   The latest scandal broke out Tuesday over how much was paid to
buy 40 French-made Mirage 2000 jet fighters.
   The conservative New Democracy party reported that the government
said it paid $40.5 million for each aircraft when purchased in 1985.
   The government, however, announced that the price was $19.4
million and angrily denied anti-government newspaper Eleftheros
Typos' allegation that Papandreou kept some of the money earmarked
for the purchase.
   Kostopoulos said this latest allegation was an example of a
``miserable scenario of slandering the premier.''

   Troops backed by helicopter gunships
battled Moslem rebels in a southern province, and 43 people were
killed, the military said Wednesday.
   Tuesday's battle in Zamboanga del Sur province, about 500 miles
southeast of Manila, was the bloodiest clash with Moslem rebels
since a cease-fire went into effect in 1986.
   Also, a judge in Manila on Wednesday acquitted a former associate
of ex-President Ferdinand Marcos of rebellion charges in connection
with an attempt to topple the government of President Corazon Aquino.
   The Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt left more than 50 dead and was
the most serious attempt to overthrow Mrs. Aquino, who became
president after a popular and military uprising ousted Marcos in
1986.
   The battle Tuesday between Philippine Army troops and Moslem
rebels claimed the lives of 32 guerrillas, eight civilians, two
government militiamen and one soldier.
   Reports said fighting erupted after about 300 rebels from the
Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
attacked the village of Kulasian to avenge the deaths of some
colleagues.
   Gunboats were dispatched to the area to prevent the rebels from
escaping by sea, reports said. Troops then conducted an air and
ground assault.
   Both the Moro National Liberation Front and the rival Moro
Islamic Liberation Front have been fighting for Moslem rule on
Mindanao and other southern islands since 1972. But fighting has
been reduced to sporadic skirmishes since the guerrillas agreed to a
cease-fire in 1986.
   Officials estimate that more than 50,000 people were killed at
the height of the Moslem rebellion in the mid-1970s.
   In Manila, Judge Maximiano Asuncion ruled there was insufficient
evidence to convict former provincial Gov. Orlando Dulay of
rebellion charges in connection with his takeover of the provincial
capitol building in Quirino province north of Manila.
   But the judge sentenced Dulay to 10 months in prison and fined
him $50 for trying to strangle then-Quirino Gov. Renicolas Delizo
and holding several employees during the takeover.
   Asuncion said Dulay's takeover of the building was not part of a
``public uprising'' necessary to convict him of rebellion. The
incident took place as more than 2,000 mutineers led by renegade Lt.
Col. Gregorio Honasan stormed the presidential palace and media and
military facilities in Manila.
   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded in
the coup attempt. Honasan escaped from a prison ship with some of
his guards in April and has not been found.
   Dulay had been held in a Quirino jail since March 1987 in
connection with the slaying of two Aquino supporters during the 1986
presidential election between Marcos and Mrs. Aquino.
   Witnesses testified that Dulay was released during the coup
attempt and, dressed in combat fatigues, led a force to the capitol
building, where he herded Delizo and others into the governor's
office at gunpoint.

<HEAD>Government Wins Appeal on Release of Classified Transcripts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that a man
charged in a Mideast hijacking is not entitled to inspect classified
transcripts of his conversations with an informant that were
covertly recorded by the FBI.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
ruled that the trial judge in the case of Fawaz Younis was wrong in
ordering the Justice Department to turn over the classified
documents.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker had ruled that Younis,
charged with leading a 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian airliner in
Beirut, was entitled to see the transcripts of his conversations
with Jamal Hamdan to prepare his defense.
   The Justice Department had appealed Parker's ruling, contending
that disclosure of the transcripts would jeopardize the intelligence
methods used to intercept the conversations.
   The appellate panel agreed, saying, ``The contents of the
transcripts were on the whole not relevant to the defendant's guilt
or innocence and the few statements that were even marginally
relevant were not sufficiently helpful or beneficial to the defense
to overcome the classified information privilege.''
   The court, in an opinion dated Monday by Judge David Sentelle,
said the government had a legitimate national-security concern about
releasing the transcripts.
   ``Much of the government's security interest in the conversations
lies not so much in the contents of the conversations as in the
time, place, and nature of the government's ability to intercept the
conversations at all,'' Sentelle said in an opinion joined by judges
Stephen Williams and Laurence Silberman.
   ``Things that do not make sense to the district judge would make
all too much sense to a foreign counterintelligence specialist who
could learn much about this nation's intelligence-gathering
capabilities from what these documents revealed about sources and
methods,'' the court said.
   The panel also chided Parker for inadvertently disclosing
classified information in his Oct. 25, 1988 order, which was quickly
edited to delete the sensitive material.
   ``Because members of the federal judiciary and their staffs are
generally not familiar with security procedures, we think it wise
that judges within this circuit direct their respective court
security officers to review orders, decisions, and memoranda before
they are released,'' the court said.
   Younis was arrested in September 1987 after he was lured by
Hamdan aboard an FBI-chartered yacht off Cyprus. He is charged with
leading a group of four other armed men who boarded a Royal
Jordanian Airline jet on June 11, 1985, in Beirut and forced the
plane to fly to several locations in the Mediterranean.
   The hijackers blew up the plane in Beirut after allowing the crew
and passengers, including several Americans, to leave.
   The appeal, made under the Classified Information Procedures Act,
is the second taken by prosecutors in the case. The same appeals
court last year overruled Parker's decision that Younis' confession
to FBI agents had been illegally obtained.
   The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 14 but the proceeding
could be delayed by further pre-trial matters. Younis is being tried
under a federal law that gives the government jurisdiction to
prosecute hijackings overseas that involve Americans.

   The number of ``cocaine babies'' born in Illinois
rose to 978 during the last half of 1988, a 78.8 percent increase
over the same period a year earlier, officials said.
   ``We had predicted this, but we were astounded that these numbers
were increasing to the point that our fears were answered,'' said
Gordon Johnson, director of the Illinois Department of Children and
Family Services.
   ``Cocaine babies'' are those who have had the drug in their
systems either as fetuses or as infants, ingesting it through their
mother's breast milk, said agency spokesman Dave Schneidman. The
babies aren't addicted, but the drug's effects may linger long after
the narcotic itself is gone, he said.
   No end to the rise is in sight, making it more expensive and
difficult for the department to find foster homes for the children,
Johnson said in a telephone interview Wednesday from Springfield.

compares with 547 babies during the same period in 1987, the
department said. About ninth-tenths of cases during both periods
were in Cook County, which includes Chicago and surrounding suburbs.
   In addition to drug abuse, the cases raise concerns about child
abuse.
   Babies whose mothers take cocaine during pregnancy _ even once _
can be born with problems that make them harder to care for once
they are home.
   Besides seizures and breathing problems, such babies are
irritable.
   An addicted mother who comes home with a ``crying, screaming''
baby is much more likely to abuse it or neglect it, Johnson said.
   ``That's the kind of child that ends up in our system,'' he said,
noting that recent increases in child-abuse cases are partly
attributable to drug-affected infants whose parents lose patience in
caring for them.
   Drug-affected babies have a higher rate of premature birth, are
more likely to be retarded and are at an increased risk for crib
death, among other problems, said Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff, director of
the Perinatal Center for Chemical Dependence at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital.
   The problem is not limited to big cities or states where cocaine
is a notorious problem, Chasnoff said Wednesday.
   ``Places you'd never expect are seeing cocaine-exposed infants,''
he said, citing Boise, Idaho; Medford, Ore., and Peoria, Ill.
   ``The numbers are escalating rapidly,'' Chasnoff said. ``There's
no question that stronger prevention programs have to be instituted
across the country.''
   The National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse estimates
that 375,000 babies _ or 10 percent of those born each year _ have
illegal drugs in their system, said Deborah Daro, research director
for the Chicago-based group.
   Doctors and hospitals are required to report cocaine babies to
the family services department, Schneidman said.

   A U.S. team of experts and 50 tons of
equipment headed to the Antarctic on Wednesday to battle a huge oil
spill that experts said was killing wildlife in the pristine polar
region.
   A U.S. Air Force cargo plane was bound for the southern city of
Punta Arenas, where the equipment will be transferred to a U.S.
research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy in Santiago said.
   Officials stressed they still were trying to assess the magnitude
of the spill, which was caused by a sunken Argentine supply ship,
but said it represented the first major environmental threat to the
Antarctic.
   The National Science Foundation in Washington said the crippled
Argentine ship carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an
``incurable disaster'' would result if all the fuel leaked into the
unspoiled waters in the region.
   In Buenos Aires, the Argentine navy played down the spill and
said it did not pose a serious ecological threat.
   But U.S. officials on Wednesday launched a massive effort to stem
the spill, which was four miles in diameter and moving to the
southwest, said Jack Talmadge, a spokesman for the National Science
Foundation.
   The spill occurred after the Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay), an
Argentine navy vessel, ran aground on Saturday in the Bismarck
Strait, about 600 miles south of the southern tip of South America
and 1{ miles from the U.S. Palmer Research Station in Antarctica.
   All passengers and crew were rescued, but the vessel floated free
in heavy seas and then capsized Tuesday night, spilling barrels of
oil and several hundred propane gas containers into the water,
Talmadge said.
   ``It has leaked oil,'' he said. ``We're not sure whether the oil
leak is continuing. The water surrounding the ship is covered with a
couple of centimeters (about an inch) of oil. There is a sheen of
oil in a much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil
on the coastline of the several islands there.''
   A private yacht 10-15 miles away reported earlier that it had
seen oil patches on the water, he said. Oil also was spotted at the
research station.
   ``Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill,
the small crustaceans that form the basis of the Antarctic food
chain, Talmadge said.
   ``Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior
differences,'' he said. ``One dead penguin had been found as of a
few hours ago.''
   A National Science Foundation statement said about 12,000 pairs
of penguins and other sea birds nested in the area last year.
   ``In a few weeks, hatchling penguins will leave their nests and
enter the now-fouled Antarctic waters, as will their parents,'' said
the statement.
   A team of 15 experts and 52 tons of equipment on a giant U.S. Air
Force C-5B cargo plane left Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday. It was to
arrive here on Thursday and then go by ship across the Drake Passage
to the accident site along the Antarctic Peninsula by Monday,
Talmadge said.
   The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic
Program, which includes Palmer Station, a scientific outpost.
   Talmadge said scientists from the station have been going out in
boats to assess the damage and try to catch the oil barrels and
propane containers floating in the water.
   ``We're trying to get those, but that's a pretty massive
project,'' he said. ``We're using all the lifeboats from the ship
and any other boats we can get hold of in the area.''
   The National Science Foundation is organizing the clean-up
mission, with assistance from the U.S. Air Force, Navy and the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
   In Buenos Aires, an Argentine navy spokesman said: ``There could
be a small stain'' from the release of oil in the engine room of the
ship. ``Anything else, no,'' He said.
   The ship carried tourists as well as fuel for several polar
stations. All 300 ship occupants were taken to the Palmer station
after the vessel ran aground.
   Another National Science Foundation spokesman in Washington, Jack
Renerie, said in a telephone interview that the cargo plane was
carrying a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and
pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat; inflatable booms to
contain the spill, and a special truck for loading and unloading the
equipment.
   He said it was accompanied by a crew from two private U.S.
clean-up companies, Marine Polution Control and Global Associates.

   Here is a list of responses by House members to
a survey conducted Jan. 13-31 by groups opposed to the proposed pay
raise.
   The survey was conducted by Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy
group founded by Ralph Nader; the National Taxpayers Union, a
non-partisan organization of fiscal conservatives; and Coalitions
for America, a conservative organization headed by activist Paul
Weyrich.
   The 50 percent pay raise for members of Congress and top federal
officials becomes law Feb. 8 unless both houses of Congress vote to
stop it.
   The survey question was: If President Reagan's proposed 50
percent pay raise comes up for a vote, how would the representative
vote?
   A ``yes'' vote is shown here as Y.
   A ``no'' vote is shown as N.
   A ``no response'' is shown as NR.
   Undecided is shown as U.
   There are two vacancies in the 435-member House.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Wednesday
offered to withdraw soldiers from some cities in the occupied lands
if Palestinians agree to limited autonomy as an interim solution to
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Palestinian leaders rejected the idea, saying they would settle
for nothing less than a Palestinian state.
   It was Shamir's most conciliatory remark yet on Israel's future
role in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Compared to his old stand, he has moved a step, but it is a far
step from meeting the demands or conditions of the Palestinian
people. We can't accept it,'' said Faisal Husseini, considered the
top pro-PLO leader in the occupied lands.
   Also Wednesday, 10 Arab teen-agers were wounded in clashes with
troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including a 13-year-old boy
shot in the head with a rubber bullet, Arab hospital officials said.
The army confirmed five wounded.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, a firebomb was hurled at a
religious seminary for Jewish settlers. A second firebomb was thrown
at the troops that arrived to conduct searches, settlers said. There
were no injuries or damage.
   Shamir presented his idea to reporters after speaking to a group
of North American rabbis.
   ``The peace process will be comprised of two stages,'' he said.
``First an interim condition and this will include full autonomy. In
the second stage (there will be) direct negotiations without
preconditions between Israel, Palestinian Arabs and Arab countries.''
   ``At a certain stage when there is autonomy, the army will leave
several urban centers and be focused in some other areas,'' he said.
   The withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas into
security pockets in the occupied territories is outlined in the 1978
Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel, but Shamir has never
specifically endorsed such a troop movement.
   Although Shamir spoke of ``full autonomy'', the accords say
Israel would still handle the terrorities' external and internal
security and foreign affairs.
   The Camp David accords call for electing local Palestinians to
participate in peace talks with Israel, Jordan and Egypt. A
five-year period of autonomy would precede negotiations on the final
status of the territories.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and many Palestinians
reject autonomy and the Camp David plan, saying these ideas are
intended to sidestep the PLO and cheat the Palestinians out of a
state.
   ``Autonomy as proposed by Israel is totally rejected,'' said
Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij, responding to Shamir's latest offer.
   ``Israel has to understand that we want a comprehensive peace
settlement ... that will ultimately achieve our sovereignty over the
West Bank and Gaza Strip,'' he said.
   Shamir told the rabbis he would never meet with the PLO and
criticized Western nations for giving credibility to PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's statements in December recognizing Israel and
renouncing terrorism.
   ``Our rights are questioned as we witness a large part of the
world dancing at the PLO-Arafat festival, which has blinded them to
reality and made them victims of delusions and deceptions,'' he said.
   While offering concessions in the political arena, Israeli
officials have endorsed harsh army measures introduced last month to
end the rebellion that began Dec. 8, 1987, and has since left 370
Palestinians and 15 Israelis dead.
   The new measures allow soldiers to fire plastic bullets at
Palestinians fleeing riots and at those erecting roadblocks.
   A Gaza City military court Tuesday sentenced six Palestinians,
including two teen-agers, to up to two years in prison for stoning
military vehicles and other targets. No one was injured in the
attacks.
   The sentences were unprecedented. In the past, stone throwers
were fined or given a few months in jail.
   Police arrested an Israeli who allegedly planned to sell the PLO
information for $1.5 million, Israel radio said. The 40-year-old
man, whose name was not released, allegedly met with PLO officials
in Greece last month.
   The man, detained Tuesday on his return at Ben Gurion Airport
near Tel Aviv, passed information to the PLO officials, the radio
said. The report did not specify what kind of information was
allegedly passed or whether any money changed hands. No charges have
yet been filed.
   An Israeli law passed in 1986 carries a three-year prison term
for unauthorized meetings with members of terrorist groups.

<TEXT>
   The president of an Oklahoma construction
company testified Wednesday that he bribed Indian officials and
pretended that a housewife of Indian descent was the principal owner
of his firm so he could get lucrative contracts to build Indian
housing.
   Kraig Kendall, president of K&amp;T Homes, Inc., told an
investigative panel of the Senate Select Committee on Indian affairs
that the government's policy of requiring companies to have 51
percent Indian ownership to win Indian-related contracts was ``an
invitation for fraud and fronts.''
   He also said his practice of giving gifts ranging from dinner
hams to expensive sports cars to Indian officials was standard
procedure among those seeking construction contracts on lands of the
Absentee Shawnee and Chickasaw tribes.
   Kendall, who pleaded guilty in 1985 to charges related to bribing
a Chickasaw governor, said contracting now ``is in a shambles.''
   ``Developers are all going to say we would prefer to go in and
bid on a competitive basis. I tried to do that.'' Kendall said.
   But he said he was unable to get contracts that way and soon
resorted to gifts and gratuities.
   ``In some cases some serious bribes,'' he said.
   ``Initially, I wined and dined them and gave them small presents
like turkeys and hams,'' Kendall said of his experience with
officials of the Absentee Shawnee housing authority.
   He said he offered the chairman of the authority _ and later the
chairman of the tribe _ tickets to University of Oklahoma football
games.
   After sending the two men to the Orange Bowl with about $500 in
cash and paid hotel reservations, Kendall said he received a
contract for a 50-unit housing project on Absentee Shawnee lands.
   Eventually, Kendall said he made a deal to kick back $500 on
every housing unit he built and gave a recreational van and a
Porsche as a means of continuing his contracting.
   Kendall described similar dealings with housing and tribal
officials of the Chickasaw nation, saying he paid $94,000 on phony
invoices from the tribal governor's construction supply
manufacturing company in order to get $14 million in contracts.
   The tribal governor, Overton James, pleaded guilty in Oklahoma
earlier this month to accepting kickbacks and has been sentenced to
prison.
   Kendall also said that in order to participate in bidding for the
contracts he made an employee's wife who had an Indian relative in
her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company.
   ``She was a housewife,'' he said. He said she never participated
in company business except to sign papers.
   The committee began its hearings into corruption in Indian
affairs Monday and has been concentrating on the ``front''
operations.
   Donald Asbra, chief of the contracting division of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, testified that the agency accepts the contractors'
word that they are majority Indian-owned and does not investigate.
   He said it is up to the Indians to police themselves and that
they can complain to the BIA if they believe business that is
supposed to go to native Americans is going to non-Indians.
   ``We don't have the capacity to inspect fronts,'' said Asbra.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the investigative
panel, asked if cases involving suspected fronts could be stopped by
BIA officials at the local level. Asbra said that was possible.
   The committee will be gathering information for several weeks on
alleged corruption in many facets of Indian affairs, including
gaming, law enforcement, education and possible sex abuse of
children.
   At one point, the committee went into private session to hear
testimony from Richard Ramirez, who, as former head of a Navy
program for small and disadvantaged business utilization, said he
had counseled participants in a minority set-aside program
established by the Small Business Administration.
   Among those he counseled was Kinross Manufacturing Co.
   According to a statement released by the committee staff, Ramirez
told the panel that Kinross, a Michigan firm that manufactures
munitions, was an Indian front company controlled by wealthy
businessmen, including some with connections to Wedtech, a
scandal-plagued Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor.
   Ramirez has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe in connection
with the Wedtech affair and is cooperating with the federal
government in cases related to SBA contractors.
   He said Kinross used one man as the applicant for admittance to
the minority program, though until 1982 the man was not enrolled in
any Indian tribe.
   Kinross applied for, and received minority certification and then
won multi-million dollar government contracts.
   Ramirez said he had never seen a start-up company supported by so
many government loans.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators on Wednesday for the
first time blamed cocaine use by a pilot as a contributing factor in
a commercial airline crash in which passengers were killed.
   The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that pilot
Stephen Silver, who was killed in a Jan. 19, 1988, Colorado commuter
crash along with eight other people, used cocaine several hours
before the flight from Denver to Durango.
   Although board investigators said Silver, 36, did not have enough
cocaine in his system to be ``high'' and his co-pilot was believed
to be controlling the Trans-Colorado aircraft's descent into
Durango, the board concluded that cocaine contributed to his
``ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized approach.'' The
co-pilot, Ralph D. Harvey, 42, was also killed in the crash. The
plane carried 15 passengers.
   Medical analysis found traces of cocaine in the pilot's blood and
urine, investigators said. They also said a girlfriend of the pilot
reportedly claimed he had taken cocaine the night before the crash,
although she refused to talk to investigators.
   Board officials said it was the first time that cocaine use by a
pilot had been ruled a factor in a crash involving a regularly
scheduled commercial passenger flight. Alcohol use has been blamed
in some previous accidents.
   Board investigator Barry Strauch said evidence showed that Silver
had used cocaine between 10 and 18 hours before the flight. He said
there was not enough evidence to determine whether Silver was a
heavy user of the drug.
   Board chemist Merritt Birky said that regular use of cocaine
could cause fatigue and a preoccupation with cocaine, affecting
performance of a pilot long after the substance was no longer giving
the user a high.
   The Fairchild Metro 3 aircraft operated by now-defunct
Trans-Colorado airlines crashed on a hillside five miles short of
the Durango runway in light snow.
   The board concluded that the plane began its descent at too high
an altitude and speed to land safely.
   The board also said the pilot had falsely obtained a medical
certificate required for flying by denying that he had a record
involving drunken driving. Investigators said Silver had several
traffic citations, including some involving drunken driving.
   The board also said the co-pilot had a prior employment and
training record that indicated ``deficiencies in performing
instrument procedures.'' The plane was landing at night in light
snow and a cloud cover.
   ``The probable cause of this accident was the first officer's
flying and the captain's ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized
approach which resulted in a descent below the published descent
profile,'' the board said in a report adopted after more than three
hours of discussion in an open hearing.
   ``Contributing to the accident was the degradation of the
captain's performance resulting from his use of cocaine before the
accident,'' the board said.
   The board recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration
require inspectors to personally examine special approaches such as
the one into Durango. The approach is over mountainous terrain and
sometimes referred to as a ``slam-dunk'' approach because of the
steep descent that is sometimes necessary.
   Board members said the FAA should help airlines obtain more
information from previous employers about the piloting skills and
abilities of prospective pilots.
   Staff investigators told the board Silver earned about $23,000 a
year and his co-pilot half as much. Board chairman James L. Kolstad
characterized the salaries as ``incredibly low.''
   The board said there was no technical problem with the aircraft
and air traffic control did not contribute to the crash.
   But it said a ground proximity warning device, if the plane had
had one, might have prevented the accident. The FAA is considering
rules to require smaller passenger planes to install the devices
which are used on all larger passenger airliners.
   The NTSB last March released a toxicology report that showed
Silver had .022 micrograms per millileter of benzoylecgonine, the
principle metabolite of cocaine, in his bloodstream.
   The report also said he had 1.8 micrograms per millileter of
metabolized cocaine and .022 micrograms of cocaine in his urine.
   Two negligence lawsuits have been filed against Continental
Airlines as a result of the crash. The plane owned Trans-Colorado
was leased to Rocky Mountain Airways, a Continental subsidiary that
flies under the name Continental Express.
   One suit, filed on behalf of Laura LaVigne, wife of the late
Kevin LaVigne of Denver, who was killed in the crash, seeks
unspecified damages because of the cocaine found in Silver's system.
   LaVigne's lawsuit also alleges the airline failed to check
records of both Silver and Harvey, which ``would have cast serious
doubt upon the propriety of hiring those pilots.''
   The other lawsuit, filed by relatives of the late Don Emergy Cox,
of Corpus Christi, Texas, also cites Silver's cocaine use.

<TEXT>
   A judge recommended bail of $12,500
for John Hull, an American linked to the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
rebels and charged by Costa Rican authorities with drug trafficking,
Hull's attorney said Wednesday.
   Attorney Elda Zuniga also said proceedings against Hull were
ordered transferred to the northern city of San Carlos.
   Costa Rican authorities arrested Hull Jan. 13 on charges of drug
trafficking and violating Costa Rican security.
   A 4th District Court judge in San Jose on Tuesday provisionally
set $12,500 bail, Ms. Zuniga said.
   She said a superior court tribunal in Alejuela Province, where
the trial is being moved, must accept the recommended bail amount.
The tribunal will officially set the bail on Monday, Ms. Zuniga said.
   Hull, 69, suffered a heart attack Jan. 24 as he was awaiting a
hearing in the capital's San Sebastian Jail and was moved to the
Mexico Hospital.
   Hospital director Matias Quezada said n Wednesday that Hull's
condition has improved, and he was recuperating in a regular
hospital room.
   Ms. Zuniga said she asked the court to transfer Hull's case to
San Carlos because that is where the crimes allegedly took place.
   Hull owns a ranch in Los Chiles, near San Carlos, which is about
104 miles north of the capital.
   A native of Indiana, Hull moved to Costa Rica 20 years ago and,
according to Ms. Zuniga, became a naturalized citizen of the Central
American country eight years ago.
   Ms. Zuniga maintains that her client is charged under a drug law
passed in 1987 and that the law is not retroactive. Hull is charged
with actions that allegedly occurred in 1984, she says.
   Sources in the Office of Judicial Investigations have said Hull
was arrested for investigation into charges of drug and weapons
trafficking and spying for the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.
   The sources said they acted after residents near Hull's farm in
Los Chiles denounced activities by Hull. The acts were seen as
possibly endagering releations between Nicaragua and Costa Rica,
they said.
   Witnesses testifying before Congress on illegal arms shipments to
the Contras said Hull's ranch was a way station for gun smugglers
and cocaine traffickers.
   Hull was not among 13 men indicted in September in Miami on
charges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reports
said Hull was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case.
   Hull has strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking.
   Hull also was among 29 people named in a civil suit filed last
year by two journalists. Tony Avirgan filed the suit with his wife,
Martha Honey, after being wounded in a 1984 bombing blamed on the
defendants.
   A U.S. district judge in Miami ruled in favor of the defendants,
saying the plaintiffs failed to prove their contention that a
conspiracy was behind the new conference bombing.
   Eight people were killed and the apparent target, then-Contra
leader Eden Pastora, was wounded.

<HEAD>Governor To Act On Richardson Case, May Hold Clemency Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BIRK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A farmworker who claims he was framed in
his 1968 conviction for poisoning his seven children has had his
case taken up by the governor who called Wednesday for a clemency
hearing.
   ``I am convinced there are still many questions about the
Richardson case that need answers,'' Gov. Bob Martinez said at a
news conference. ``The interests of justice compel us to seek those
answers.''
   James Richardson, 53, is challenging his murder conviction on the
grounds that new evidence indicates he was framed and someone else
has confessed to the killings.
   His case given to Dade County state attorney Janet Reno in the
3-month-old investigation because there is conflicting information
in the case and she has subpoena power, Martinez said.
   ``There were seven deaths. We can't forget that,'' Martinez said.
``Seven little ones died and someone was found guilty. If there was
a wrongdoing at that time, we would like to know about it. Justice
ought to prevail, whatever it may be.''
   Three of the six members of the governor's independently elected
Cabinet will have to agree with Martinez's request for a clemency
hearing before one can be scheduled.
   The Cabinet and Martinez, sitting as the board of executive
clemency, have the power to pardon Richardson. Aides to four of the
Cabinet officers said their bosses had not yet been briefed on the
case.
   A fifth, Attorney General Bob Butterworth, was ready to support
Martinez's request, an aide said. The sixth did not immediately
return telephone calls.
   The governor's office and the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement have been investigating the matter since October, when
the credibility of the 20-year-old case came under scrutiny.
   In December, Richardson's defense attorneys filed a petition in
the Florida Supreme Court seeking another trial because of new
evidence, and won a Feb. 9 hearing.
   Defense lawyers Ellis Rubin of Miami and Mark Lane of Washington,
D.C., contend prosecutors framed Richardson and that a neighbor who
frequently baby-sat with the children was the killer.
   Attorneys have said that if a new trial is granted, the passage
of time may make it impossible to assemble a credible case, either
for the defense or prosecution, because witnesses have died and
memories have faded.
   When Richardson and his wife were picking fruit on Oct. 25, 1967,
their children, aged 2 to 8, ate a lunch of beans, rice and grits
laced with the higly toxic pesticide parathion.
   The lunch had been prepared ahead of time, but was served by the
neighbor at the family's Arcadia home.
   Richardson is serving a life sentence in Tomoka Correctional
Institution near Daytona Beach. He is eligible for parole in 1993.
He had been sentenced to death but that was reduced to life in
prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state's
death-penalty statute in the early 1970s.
   Prosecutors said he murdered all seven children, but he was
convicted of only one first-degree murder count in May 1968 for the
death of his 8-year-old stepdaughter.
   The petition for a new trial includes claims that evidence was
withheld. Also, his attorneys say they have statements from two
nursing home employees caring for the former neighbor, 67, that she
admitted killing the children.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan on
Wednesday offered to send about 30 civilian observers to Namibia
this year to monitor elections, his spokesman said.
   Takeshita made the offer during a meeting with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, said Koichi Haraguchi, a Japanese Foreign
Ministry spokesman.
   Japan's previous contributions to U.N. peacekeeping efforts have
been largely financial.
   ``There is a sort of increasing recognition among Japanese people
that simply to supply money is not enough. We should also offer our
sweat,'' Haraguchi told reporters.
   Takeshita, who arrived in New York on Tuesday, made no public
statements at the United Nations. On Thursday, he is to meet in
Washington with President Bush.
   Takeshita, who will be the first foreign head of government to
meet with Bush since his inauguration, is to return to Tokyo on
Tuesday.
   Perez de Cuellar and Takeshita met with U.N. officials in charge
of monitoring Namibia's transition to independence from South Africa.
   Under a U.S.-brokered agreement intended to bring independence to
Namibia and peace to southern Africa, Namibia is to hold its first
free elections for a national assembly on Nov. 1.
   The United Nations is expected to send about 800 election
supervisers to Namibia, a territory South Africa has controlled as
since World War I.
   As part of the agreement, Cuba agreed to withdraw troops helping
Angola's Marxist government fight South Africa- and U.S.-backed
guerrillas.
   Besides offering to send about 30 observers to Namibia, Takeshita
offered $134 million in aid to help Afghan refugees, Haraguchi said.
   He also offered $13.5 million for Namibia peacekeeping efforts
and $2.5 million for general peacekeeping purposes, Japanese
officials said.

<HEAD>Foundation Says Peary Notes Provide No Evidence of Faked Claim</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A page of calculations made by Admiral
Robert E. Peary provides no evidence that he faked his claim to have
reached the North Pole in 1909, a non-profit navigators group said
Wednesday.
   The findings by The Navigation Foundation leave open to scholarly
debate whether Peary reached his destination.
   ``Properly understood, this worksheet says absolutely nothing
about whether Peary reached the pole,'' said retired Rear Adm.
Thomas D. Davies, president of the foundation, which was
commissioned by the National Geographic Society to look into the
Peary controversy.
   ``The paper provides no evidence Peary faked his claim,'' Davies
said in a presentation at the Naval Academy planetarium _ complete
with laser images to highlight the star Betelgeux that he believes
Peary used as a guide.
   Peary's claim has had many detractors. One of the most vocal is
Dennis Rawlins, an astronomer and historian who grabbed headlines
last fall when he concluded that Peary lied about his location and
used Betelgeux, a star that wouldn't have been visible when the sun
was up 24 hours a day, to hide the truth.
   ``Suggesting Peary might not have reached the pole is one thing;
declaring him a fraud is another,'' said Gilbert M. Grosvenor,
president of the National Geographic Society, which helped
underwrite Peary's 1909 expedition, in attacking Rawlins' contention.
   After publishing a 1970 article and a 1973 book arguing that
Peary was off course, Rawlins went further last October, saying the
worksheet unsealed in 1984 showed Peary 121 miles shy of his
destination.
   Davies said three experts determined the calculations likely were
made in February 1906 during an earlier Arctic expedition, not April
1909 as written on the envelope in which Peary's wife apparently
placed them.
   Davies said Rawlins interpreted one set of numbers as compass
readings when they were ``serial numbers of the watch-type
chronometers Peary carried with him.''
   ``Rawlins assumes that the worksheet shows altitude observations
of the sun taken on April 7, 1909, when Peary says that he was at
the pole,'' Davies wrote in the foundation's report. ``Rawlins'
analysis is clearly incorrect. The numbers Rawlins assumes are
degrees, minutes and seconds of arc can also be interpreted as
hours, minutes and seconds of time,'' he wrote.
   Rawlins interrupted the meeting to defend himself, calling the
Navigation Foundation report ``a very competent presentation,'' and
admitting his error on the chronometer serial numbers.
   ``In terms of the (National) Geographic versus me, this is one
for the Geographic,'' he said.
   However, he maintained that the readings were taken in 1909 and
said he has 10 pieces of evidence that Peary didn't make it to the
North Pole.
   Davies said the foundation will review other data and the Peary
archive as it continues to evaluate Peary's claim.
   Wally Herbert, a British explorer writing in the September 1988
issue of National Geographic, found that Peary was 30 to 60 nautical
miles off course. Rawlins found Peary came no closer than 121 miles
from his goal, but because of difficult conditions and low supplies
felt pressured to say he had reached the North Pole.
   Retired Cmdr. Edward P. Stafford of Chester, Md., Peary's
grandson, defended his grandfather's integrity. ``He was accurate.
He has always been shown to be where he said he was, when he said he
was,'' Stafford said.

<HEAD>Sakharov Candidacy Subject of Press Debate, Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov said Wednesday that his defeat
in a bid to represent the Academy of Sciences in a new Soviet
parliament showed the academy's ruling presidium is not ready for
democratic reform.
   But Pravda, the Communist Party daily, rejected suggestions that
undemocratic procedures were used to block Sakharov's nomination.
   The 67-year-old dean of the Soviet human rights movement again
has become a controversial figure in Moscow, but this time he is
being both criticized and defended in the state-run press that once
either ignored or vilified him.
   A band of Sakharov's supporters called a meeting for Thursday to
protest his Jan. 18 electoral defeat, although he was nominated two
days later as a parliamentary candidate from a Moscow district.
   Sakharov is among several thousand candidates for the new
2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies, a parliamentary body that
will be elected in March and which will in turn elect a full-time
legislature and a president.
   There is little doubt President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
proposed creation of the new parliamentary body, will be re-elected
head of state.
   Sakharov was quoted in the weekly Literary Gazette, a newspaper
popular among Soviet intellectuals, as saying the nominating process
in the Academy of Sciences worked well at the lower level, where
younger scientists hold sway.
   But when the leadership made its final picks, he said, only top
administrators were picked to represent the prestigious academy in
the new parliament, which will have representatives from both
geographic districts and from professional, political and social
organizations.
   He charged the leadership failed to fulfill its legal obligations
and ignored the popular will in selecting its candidates.
   Pravda, however, said the meeting at which Sakharov was defeated
``was not only fully democratic but benevolent.''
   After his defeat in a bid to represent the academy, he won the
overwhelming support of members of his own institute as a candidate
for a seat in the district where the academy is located.
   Sakharov is a physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen
bomb and later won a Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights
activities.
   The government newspaper Izvestia, meanwhile, criticized Sakharov
for suggesting in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro
that Gorbachev could be toppled or stymied by Soviet conservatives.
   It said such statements, unsupported by solid information, cause
confusion and uncertainty and can only harm Gorbachev's reforms.

<HEAD>Scotland Yard Investigated Claims Hess Was Murdered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scotland Yard said Wednesday that it investigated
claims Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess was murdered in a West Berlin
prison, contrary to the official ruling that he committed suicide.
   A Scotland Yard spokesman, who refused to be identified in
keeping with British custom, refused to comment on the outcome or
any other details of the investigation by its serious crimes squad,
made at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
   ``The DPP asked us to investigate suggestions that Hess did not
die by his own hand,'' Scotland Yard, said in a brief statement. ``A
preliminary report has gone to the DPP for his decision on whether
any further action is needed.''
   The statement did not say why Scotland Yard, which coordinates
national police work, was asked to investigate the possibility of
murder.
   The Director of Public Prosecutions directs the Crown Prosecution
Service, which handles the prosecution of criminal proceedings begun
by police forces.
   Hess' family believes Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy held by Allied
nations in a prison in Spandau in the British sector of West Berlin,
did not commit suicide but was murdered Aug. 17, 1987, at the age of
93.
   The spokesman said Scotland Yard did not investigate a British
doctor's claims that a Hess impostor was murdered in the prison.
   ``It would appear from this (Scotland Yard) statement that we
accept the premise that he was who he said he was,'' he said.
   Dr. Hugh Thomas, who has written two books on Hess, says Hess was
murdered while flying to Scotland on a peace mission in 1941 and
that an impersonator in a second plane was substituted by plotters
among Hitler's deputies.
   Hess parachuted alone into Scotland on May 10, 1941, but concerns
about his identity were raised even then.
   Thomas said he has seen unpublished reports of two autopsies and
unpublished photographs of the body in Spandau showing marks on the
neck inconsistent with a suicide hanging.
   The autopsies, he said, also supported his contention that the
prisoner did not bear scars of a severe chest wound Hess suffered in
World War I.
   He alleges that the prisoner was murdered to stop the leak of
details of a World War II plot by powerful Britons to overthrow
Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
   Thomas, a surgeon who was a British army doctor when he examined
the prisoner in Spandau in 1973, first made his claim that the
prisoner was not Hess in his 1979 book, ``The Murder of Rudolf
Hess.'' The other book he wrote on the subject, ``Prisoner No. 7,''
was published last year.

<HEAD>Winter Makes A Roaring Comeback After Springlike Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe winter weather, stinging wind chill levels and
temperatures way below zero settled over the northern Plains
Wednesday to end an unseasonably warm spell. Eastern cities,
meanwhile, set a string of record highs.
   Midday temperatures were in the minus 15 to minus 30 range from
Montana across North Dakota to Northern Minnesota. The 18 below in
Billings, Mont., set a record low for the date, eclipsing the minus
12 mark set in 1979.
   Wind chill temperatures were in the dangerous range across much
of the region, with Tioga, N.D., reporting a wind chill of 90 below
Wednesday morning.
   The cold front that ushered in the arctic blast pushed into the
Middle Mississippi Valley and southern Plains, sending the mercury
plummeting in its wake. The temperature dropped 18 degrees in one
hour at Ardmore, Okla. Russell, Kan., which on Tuesday shared the
nation's high of 84 degrees, had temperatures in the mid-teens
Wedenesday with wind chills in the minus 30 range.
   Snow and strong winds remained in some areas behind the front,
especially from the northern Rockies to the Pacific Northwest. Up to
9 inches of new snow fell at the east entrance to Yellowstone
National Park. In Washington, snow fell at the rate of an inch an
hour at Olympia and wind gusts of more than 60 mph were clocked at
Bellingham. Winds in Spokane downed trees and power lines, leaving
many residents without heat as the temperature hovered at zero, with
wind chills at 40 to 60 below.
   Meanwhile, much of the East enjoyed unseasonably warm weather
with dozens of cities recording record highs. Temperatures ranged in
the 70s over parts of the Middle Atlantic States and in the 60s into
southern New England and the Ohio Valley.
   The 61 degrees at Portland, Maine, was the second-warmest
February temperature ever recorded. The warmest was 64 degrees on
Feb. 27, 1957.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 31 below
at Cut Bank, Mont., to 85 at McAllen, Texas. The minus 31 in Cut
Bank was also the morning low for the nation.
   Thursday's forecast called for scattered snow in the Pacific
Northwest across much of the Rockies, the northern and central
Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes to northern
New England, with snow heaviest over the Dakotas and Minnesota and
accompanied by strong winds and bitterly cold temperatures. Freezing
rain and sleet was predicted for western and north-central Texas
across much of Oklahoma, central Missouri and Illinois into northern
Indiana. Showers and thunderstorms were expected to reach from
southern and eastern Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley to
the lower Tennessee and Ohio valleys, with more rain from the upper
Ohio Valley to southern New England, and over parts of California.
   Highs should keep below minus 20 over much of Montana, and below
zero from western Minnesota across the Dakotas and northern Nebraska
to northeast Wyoming. Highs should be below freezing over northern
new England, the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley, much of
the Great Plains, the central Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.
Highs should creep into the 60s and 70s from the Atlantic Coast
states across the Tennessee Valley and Gulf Coast, as well as in
southern Arizona and California. Highs should warm into the 80s in
Florida, southern Louisiana and the southern tip of Texas.

   The late surrealist painter Salvador Dali
left his entire estate to the Spanish government, the Ministry of
Culture said Wednesday.
   Dali died of heart failure Jan. 23 in his hometown of Figueras at
the age of 84. Media reports have indicated the estate is worth
about $87.7 million, but the ministry made no mention of its value.
   The ministry said it was informed by notary public Jose Maria
Foncillas Casaus that a will dictated to him by Dali in September
1982 named the Spanish state as the painter's sole heir.
   The ministry said it was ``grateful for the great generosity of
the exceptional creator toward the Spanish people and assumes with
full responsibility the obligations that derive from this legacy, in
particular the requirement to `conserve, make known and protect his
works of art.'''
   During the last years of Dali's life, there was speculation his
principal merchant and agent, Robert Descharnes, and Antoni Pixot, a
painter and close family friend, would be named beneficiaries of his
will.
   Dali is survived by his sister, Ana Maria, 80, from whom he had
been estranged many years.
   The Barcelona daily La Vanguardia said Tuesday that the estate
consists of 250 Dali paintings, at least 50 said to be of
``considerable value,'' numerous drawings and works by other
artists, the Pubol castle in the village of La Pera, a house in the
port of Cadaques and some land around Figueras. All the properties
are in the northeastern region of Catalonia.

<TEXT>
   An IRA bomb hidden in a
drainpipe outside a pub exploded, killing a British soldier and
wounding another as the two walked by on patrol, police said
Wednesday.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting British
rule in the province, claimed in a coded message to news
organizations that it was responsible for the Tuesday night attack.
   The bomb exploded as a joint army-police foot patrol passed the
pub Tuesday night in the Falls Road area, a Roman Catholic enclave
and IRA stronghold in west Belfast.
   Police said infantryman Pvt. Nicholas David Peacock, 20, who was
on his second day of duty in Northern Ireland when the attack
occurred, died early Wednesday while undergoing surgery for wounds
to his legs and lower body.
   The other soldier suffered slight injuries, officials said.
   Peacock's father, David, who lives in Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's hometown of Grantham in Lincolnshire, said: ``It is
barbaric that a lad out on peaceful patrol should be blown up like
that. But it won't alter my position one bit. I still believe the
army should stay put. It has my full backing.''
   A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the bomb
was concealed in a drainpipe on the wall of the pub and contained
about 2 pounds of explosives ``with a command wire running to an
entry at the rear'' of the pub.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to oust the British
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Catholic Irish
Republic under a leftist administration.
   Later, a bomb attached to a lamppost exploded, injuring one
policeman slightly, as police evacuated an area in Belfast city
center, a police spokesman said.
   Police began clearing an area of Oxford Street after a bomb was
thrown over the wall of a police station Wednesday evening. The bomb
failed to explode but as police evacuated the area, a second bomb
went off, the spokesman said.
   He said the injured policeman was treated at a local hospital and
released.
   No one claimed responsibility, but two men were being questioned
about the bombing, the spokesman said.
   Also Wednesday evening, a bomb was thrown at a joint police and
army patrol in Londonderry city center, the spokesman said.
   Police fired at the bombers but were ``not claiming any hits,''
he said. No one was injured.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   HUD Secretary-designate Jack Kemp accepted
thousands of dollars in speaking fees in excess of the limits set by
House rules and federal law, according to his own financial
disclosure statements.
   In all, Kemp accepted or agreed to $67,350 above what House rules
allow, his statements show.
   The Associated Press learned Wednesday that when confronted with
the apparent violation, the former congressman from Buffalo, N.Y.,
agreed this week to return $16,000 in speaking fees and to forgo
another $39,400 in fees not yet received.
   He also deferred receipt of an additional $12,500 in fees earned
in 1988 until 1989 to avoid violating the limits on honoraria
congressmen can receive in any one year. The actions brought Kemp
$550 below his 1988 limit.
   A spokeswoman for Kemp, Mary Brunette, described the problems as
``just a misunderstanding.'' A key Senate aide said Kemp had
mistakenly believed that money received after Kemp left Congress did
not apply to House limits.
   Kemp filed an amended financial reporting form with the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the U.S. Office of
Government Ethics this past Monday to reflect the changes. The
changes were made without public disclosure by either Kemp or the
Senate committee until AP noticed the problem in its review of
Kemp's financial statements.
   The committee has scheduled a vote to confirm Kemp, an
unsuccessful 1988 Republican presidential candidate, as secretary of
Housing and Urban Development on Thursday.
   The staff director for the Democratic-controlled banking
committee, Kevin Gottlieb, confronted Kemp personally last week with
the form showing excess income for 1988. He said Kemp, who retired
from Congress on Jan. 2 after 18 years in the House, said he was
unaware he had violated the limits on honoraria and cooperated fully.
   Kemp was subject to the House rules limiting all outside income,
including honoraria, to 30 percent of his $89,500 congressional
salary _ or $26,850. In addition, less restrictive federal statute
limits honoraria to 40 percent of congressional salary, or $35,800.
   In his original filing, Kemp reported receiving $119,000 in
honoraria for 1988. He also reported giving $24,800 of it to
charity, which under House rules is not counted against the limit.
   House rules also limit honoraria _ fees for speeches or similar
appearances _ to no more than $2,000 per event.
   In his original filing, Kemp reported several honoraria well in
excess of that $2,000 limit. He reported receiving $30,000 for two
appearances on the television show Firing Line in September and
October, and $10,000 each for speeches to Hartford University, A.B.
Laffer and Associates, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He also
reported receiving $5,000 from World Trade Assoc., and $2,400 from
Crosby Assoc.
   Gottlieb said that Kemp told him he believed the limits did not
apply because he was leaving Congress and would not receive the
checks until after he was out of office.
   ``He thought that once the monies were received after he was a
member of Congress that the limit didn't apply,'' Gottlieb said.
``Well, clearly the limit does apply, and when it was pointed out to
him that it does, he turned around and made the appropriate
adjustment.''
   As a result, he said, Kemp agreed to return $8,000 each to
Hartford University and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and to reduce
his Firing Line fee to $2,000 per appearance, or $4,000.
   He also agreed to reduce the fees for World Trade and Laffer to
$2,000 each and to forgo altogether the Crosby fee, Brunette said.
   Because the totals still would exceed the overall House limit on
honoraria, Kemp shifted fees totaling $12,500 to 1989 _ when he said
he actually received or will receive them, according to both
Gottlieb and Brunette. That gave him a 1988 honoraria total of just
over $26,000 and within the limit, they said.
   Gottlieb said that after consulting with staff of the House
ethics committee he decided House rules permitted honoraria to be
counted in the year actually received, even though earned in a
different year.

<HEAD>NASA Delays Space Shuttle Launch To Replace Turbopumps</HEAD>

   NASA said Wednesday night it is
delaying the launch of Discovery from late February to mid-March to
replace three suspect turbopumps whose failure could be fatal to a
shuttle and its crew.
   The announcement came following a high-level meeting of shuttle
managers who have debated for several days whether to pull the
high-speed turbopumps, which transform liquid oxygen into gas in the
spaceship's main engines.
   Officials said Discovery will be transported to the launch pad
early Friday and switching of the pumps will be done there in
parallel with other operations. The first pump could be pulled as as
early as Sunday.
   Because of the uncertainty of the availability of new pumps and
the length of time to make the replacements, NASA said it would not
set a firm launch date until a flight readiness review in late
February.
   It said the earliest the launch could take place would be in
mid-March. The agency had been aiming for a Feb. 23 liftoff, but a
series of technical delays not related to the pumps already had
delayed that date several days.
   If the date slips past mid-March, the planned April 28 launch of
Atlantis with the Magellan-Venus probe would also have to be
delayed, officials said.
   The three turbopumps became questionable when engineers
discovered two tiny cracks in a bearing unit in one of Atlantis'
pumps after it completed the second post-Challenger mission in
December.
   The engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion
resulting from moisture trapped inside the bearing housing during
the manufacturing process. But they are not certain how the moisture
penetrated the metal.
   Officials became concerned when it was learned that two of
Discovery's pump bearings had gone through the same manufacturing
process as the cracked one.
   They decided at Wednesday's meeting to remove all three pumps and
replace them with new, carefully-inspected units.
   The turbopumps operate in flight at extremely high speeds,
pressures and temperatures, and a failure of one of them could set
off a fatal engine explosion. The cracks on Atlantis were too small
to cause trouble, but if such cracks widened and split the bearing
unit, it could be dangerous, NASA said.
   The agency has said the Atlantis mission in April has priority
over the launch of Discovery with its communications satellite and
that it would scrub the Discovery flight until later in the year if
it can't get off the pad by about March 15.
   That's because the Atlantis astronauts have only a 25-day launch
window that is favorable for dispatching Magellan to Venus. Earth
and Venus will not be in proper alignment again until 1991.
   NASA said it could delay the Atlantis flight a few days, but
that's something it would not like to do. It would like to preserve
the entire launch window in case of problems.
   Only one shuttle launch pad is currently available. A second is
being refurbished.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi on Wednesday
announced a new government with Moslem fundamentalists retaining two
key posts, indicating a continued tough stance against southern
Christian and animist rebels.
   Hassan Turabi, leader of the fundamentalist National Islamic
Front, was named foreign minister and deputy premier, and a member
of his party, Hafez Sheikh Zaki, justice minister and attorney
general, the official Sudan News Agency reported.
   The Islamic Front's retention of the foreign and justice
portfolios gives it an influential voice in any peace talks with the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, a predominantly Christian and
animist group that opposes Islamic law.
   Five of the 10 new appointments went to Mahdi's Umma Party, the
principal coalition partner, four to the Islamic Front and one to a
southern party.
   Defense Minister Abdul-Majid Khalil of the Umma Party retained
his post.
   The new 24-member coalition comprises 11 Umma ministers, seven
from the National Islamic Front, five from small southern parties
and one from the Sudan National Party of western Sudan, the news
agency said.
   Turabi, who was justice minister and acting foreign minister, was
among seven ministers whose resignations were accepted Tuesday by
Sudan's five-member State Council, which acts as a collective
presidency.
   It is Mahdi's fourth government since he became the first elected
leader in 16 years in April 1986. The military ousted longtime
strongman Gaafar Nimeiri a year earlier.
   The lingering civil war in the south, famine and drought, then
floods, have destablilized the country. Sudanese staged strikes and
demonstrations in December to protest government price increases.
   The latest shakeup was prompted when the Democratic Unionist
Party, the second-largest in the Constituent Assembly, quit the
coalition last month. The party signed a peace accord in November
with rebel leader John Garang, a renegade army colonel.
   The agreement's provisions included suspension of Islamic law
during peace negotiations.
   Turabi, the premier's brother-in-law, has been at the center of
debate over the tentative peace agreement and controversy over the
fate of Islamic law, or Sharia, which Nimeiri decreed in September
1983.
   Mahdi has spoken of possible amendments to Islamic law, and this
would give the Justice Ministry, still held by the National Islamic
Front, a key drafting role.

<HEAD>Jailed Attacker Urges Iran To Insist On Release In Hostage Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese imprisoned for trying to kill of a former
Iranian prime minister urged Iran on Wednesday to insist on his
release, implying that a pardon was part of the deal that led to
freedom for three French hostages in Lebanon.
   The French government last year denied widespread reports that it
won the hostages' release in part by agreeing to pardon Anis
Naccache, who led four other pro-Iranian attackers in a failed
attempt to kill Shapour Bakhtiar, Iran's last prime minister before
the Islamic Revolution.
   Naccache's appeal was made in a statement issued late Wednesday
night by his lawyer Antoine Comte.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas plans to go to Iran on
Sunday for the first high-level visit since diplomatic relations
were restored last year as part of the hostage deal.
   ``I ask the Iranian government, which guaranteed the accord
between France and the parties concerned during the liberation of
the hostages, to remind France of its engagements,'' the statement
said. ``It is inadmissible to say that relations between the two
countries are good while five soldiers of Islam are still in French
prisons.''
   Naccache and three other men were sentenced to life in prison for
the July 1980 assault on Bakhtiar, which left a bystander and a
policeman dead and three other police officers wounded.
   The fifth member of Naccache's team got a 20-year-sentence.
Bakhtiar, who lives in exile in Paris, was not hurt.
   French authorities believed that Naccache's orders to assassinate
the former prime minister came from senior Iranian officials.
   While France was seeking to win freedom for its hostages in
Lebanon, President Francois Mitterrand said publicly that he would
be willing to pardon Naccache, but only as part of a deal in which
all French hostages were freed.
   Last May, when journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomats
Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine were released by their pro-Iranian
captors in Beirut, Mitterrand and then-Premier Jacques Chirac denied
that Naccache's release was part of the deal.
   Kauffmann, Carton and Fontaine were held by a group called
Islamic Jihad, which is still holding some of the 15 Western
hostages in Lebanon. The longest held is American journalist Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Reports that France made important concessions to get its
hostages back drew criticism, especially in Britain, on the grounds
that such deals could make it more difficult to win freedom for
other hostages without making similar bargains.
   French officials insisted they agreed only to restore good
relations and to repay a $1 billion loan originally made by the shah
of Iran for a uranium enrichment plant, and frozen after the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution.

<TEXT>
   Manuel Lujan, President Bush's choice for
Interior secretary, won unanimous approval for the Cabinet post
Wednesday in a vote by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee.
   The committee approved Lujan's nomination by a 19-0 vote in a
session lasting less than 30 minutes. The former New Mexico
congressman is expected to win swift approval by the full Senate.
   Lujan, 60, who spent 20 years as a member of the House, breezed
through a hearing of the panel last week. Both Republicans and
Democrats had praised him.
   During the hearing, Lujan said he and Bush are ``committed to
protecting and enhancing'' the natural resources while allowing
needed development.
   Lujan's nomination has only received a lukewarm response from
environmental groups, however. They have raised concern about the
former congressman's voting record on environmental matters.
   During two decades in Congress, Lujan received consistently low
ratings from the League of Conservation Voters, the lobbying arm of
the major environmental organizations. The group said Lujan voted in
favor of pro-environmental legislation only twice out of 16 test
votes cast.
   At the same time, he has been characterized as a pragmatist and
strong advocate for the varying interests of the West.

   Two men accused of detonating a remote-control
bomb that seriously wounded a sheriff were to be paid $20,000 for
killing him, according to a federal document unsealed Wednesday.
   The six-page federal complaint was made public one day after
Marshall K. McClendon, 42, of Slaughter and John Tullier Jr, 23, of
St. Amant were arrested in connection with the Dec. 15 bombing.
   Lafourche Parish Sheriff Duffy Breaux nearly died from shock and
blood loss when his foot was nearly severed in the blast, doctors
say. One of his deputies was also injured.
   ``A few days before Christmas, McClendon and Tullier went to
Baton Rouge to get paid for the bombing. They returned to
McClendon's barn with $8,000 cash. They were to receive an
additional $12,000 for a total of $20,000 for the completed job,''
the complaint said.
   The information was provided by an unidentified source who knew
both men and had talked with them about the bombing, according to an
affidavit that was part of the complaint. The document does not say
who wanted Breaux dead or why.
   More arrests are expected, said Mike Hall, special agent in
charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in New
Orleans.
   The source cited in the complaint said McClendon claimed to have
placed the bomb in a paper bag next to the sheriff's car. McClendon
said he set off the bomb after he saw Breaux approach the bag and
kick it, the affidavit said.
   The complaint said BATF experts in Atlanta determined that the
bomb was a wooden box encasing two pipes loaded with explosives,
nails and bullets. It appeared to have been detonated by a model
airplane remote control device.
   According to federal agents, McClendon is a former police officer
in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. He also held a Lafourche Parish
Sheriff's Office commission and was involved with a drug task force
in the parish in the early 1970s.
   Tullier was described as an unemployed instrument fitter.
   In a brief hearing in Baton Rouge Wednesday, a magistrate ordered
the two men sent to New Orleans for a bond hearing to be held in the
next 10 days.
   If convicted on bombing and conspiracy charges, each man could
get up to 25 years in prison and a $25,000 fine, said Stewart Allen,
another ATF agent.
   Breaux, 60, and Deputy Daniel Leche, 62, were injured as they
left a Christmas party for senior citizens at a civic center.
   Doctors were able to reconnect Breaux's foot and predicted he
would regain 90 percent use of it within a year. He was discharged
from the hospital last month. Leche was released after two days in
the hospital.
   In addition to the federal charges, Lafourche Parish prosecutors
Wednesday charged the men with two counts each of attempted murder.
U.S. Attorney Ray Lamonica of Baton Rouge said the federal charges
would be addressed first.

   State Department officials on Wednesday
defended the agency's restrictions on blind persons who apply to
become diplomats, but the officials who spoke at a congressional
hearing were treated derisively by an audience overwhelmingly
composed of sightless persons.
   Under State Department policy, the blind may apply to become
foreign service officers but, in a policy change that became
effective late last year, they cannot use braille or receive help
from readers when taking entrance examinations.
   More than 100 blind persons crowded into the hearing of the House
Human Resources civil service subcommittee and made clear through
occasional snickers and groans their displeasure with two State
Department witnesses sent to explain the agency's position.
   Much of the hearing focussed on the case of Avraham Rabby, who
has been trying unsuccessfully since 1985 to become a career
diplomat and who testified that the State Department's treatment of
him reflects either ``sheer ignorance or deliberate deception.''
   Rabby, who lives in New York City and has passed five State
Department entrance examinations, is a graduate of Oxford University
in England with degrees in Spanish and French and has a master's
degree in business administration from the University of Chicago.
   He lived for 15 years in England and speaks in the cultured tones
of a man accustomed to intellectual pursuits. He has his own
consulting business, helping disabled people find employment.
   Rabby, 46, rejected the suggestion that gestures such as winks
and nods form part of the overall message a diplomat must assimilate
and that therefore the profession is not suitable for a blind person.
   ``No international treaty has ever been decided on the basis of a
wink or a nod.'' he said.
   Subcommittee Chairman Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., criticized the
State Department policy and the agency's decision to impose strict
limits on the degree to which the two department witnesses could
respond to questions.
   The witnesses were Charles Stout, a director in the State
Department personnel office, and Sheldon Yuspeh, coordinator of the
handicapped employment program.
   Stout said it is difficult for the foreign service to accommodate
blind persons because of the problem they have in working
independently from official documents and the requirement that all
career diplomats be available to serve worldwide on short notice,
including countries which have unfamiliar settings and cultures.
   Sikorski's position is that federal law requires all government
and government-assisted agencies to conduct employment practices
without discrimination on the basis of handicap.
   Evan J. Kemp Jr., commissioner of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, said Congress should consider withholding
State Department appropriations if the agency does not demonstrate a
more flexible attitude toward blind applicants.

   President Bush, offering ``a thousand apologies
for the way I sound,'' canceled one speech and drastically shortened
another Wednesday as he continued to battle a bad case of laryngitis.
   Bush, who has had a cold for about a week and whose voice has
been steadily deteriorating, canceled a speech before the National
Association of Religious Broadcasters at a downtown hotel.
   Later in the day, he lasted less than a minute in an appearance
before a business group at the Executive Office Building next to the
White House before turning the microphone over to Chief of Staff
John Sununu, who continued the speech in his behalf.
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Bush
backed out of the first speech because ``it was advisable that he
rest his voice at this time.''
   But in the evening, Bush was well enough to host a a reception
for more than 400 diplomatic heads of mission, standing for more
than an hour in a lengthy receiving line and then mingling briefly
with the guests.
   Bush told reporters he was feeling much better after having taken
antibiotics for an ear condition, and was now only suffering from a
hoarse voice.
   ``It's nice,'' said his wife, Barbara. ``He doesn't yell around
the house.''
   Hoarse voice aside, Bush was animated in his brief appearance
before the annual meeting of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors.
   ``Thank you all very much for being here and a thousand apologies
for the way I sound,'' Bush said.
   Victor Kanners, chairman of the organization, told Bush: ``Don't
worry about it. We've learned to read your lips.''
   Sununu, delivering Bush's speech, appealed to the organization to
help rally support within the business community for the
yet-to-be-announced deficit reduction proposals that Bush will
outline to Congress on Feb. 9.
   He also thanked the group for its early endorsement of Bush's
presidential candidacy.
   Bush's voice has been getting worse by the day.
   At a speech Tuesday in Norfolk, Va., Bush sounded very raspy.
Later, he joked that he had been ``just croaking away'' and had
worried during the speech that he would not be able to complete it.
   Despite his cold, Bush went to work about 7:15 a.m. Wednesday and
had a series of appointments extending past 5 p.m. Bush and his
wife, Barbara, were to host a black-tie reception for the diplomatic
corps at the White House.
   Meanwhile, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who has
been complaining of flu-like symptoms, called in sick Wednesday
after leaving work early on Tuesday.

   Heard the one about the two-headed snake
that couldn't agree on which head got to eat dinner?
   It's no joke, if you're talking about the two-headed black rat
snake named ``IM'' (for ``instinct'' and ``mind'') that has been
under observation at the University of Tennessse here since shortly
after its birth 12 years ago.
   ``If one head gets a good grip on the head of the mouse and the
other gets a good grip on the tail, they can fight for hours unless
you stop them,'' said Gordon Burghardt, who teaches psychology and
zoology at the university.
   ``They're simply fighting for the privilege of swallowing the
mouse,'' he said Wednesday. The prey in their twice-monthly meals,
he noted, ends up in the common stomach.
   IM is showing researchers whether over time animals can learn to
share, he said. ``We found the left head ate more prey, but it was
smaller. And the right head ate fewer prey which tended to be
larger,'' he said.
   ``Over five years, the weight of the prey eaten was identical
(for both heads). So the animals were in some sense splitting the
resource. We didn't expect that,'' he said.
   The university got IM from nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
where two boys found the animal in their family's garden.
   Back then, the two heads ``really had two separate identities,''
said Jerry Klein, a research engineer and amateur herpetologist at
the Oak Ridge lab. ``If one wanted to eat, it would try to keep the
food from the other.''
   Burghardt said the animal also is providing clues on theories of
motivation and cognition. ``We can test out some ideas in
motivational psychology that we normally couldn't, such as, why do
you stop eating?'' he said.
   ``One is, do you stop eating when your stomach is distended? Or
is the amount you eat determined by the effort in chewing and
swallowing?
   ``We're still analyzing at this point, but the indication is that
the animal (IM's left head or right head) that swallows is somewhat
less responsive afterward than the one that hasn't. That suggests
that the act of eating plays some role on the regulation of food
intake.''

   Most Western and neutral diplomats in
Afghanistan believe President Najib's government will fall by July
without Soviet military support, the senior envoy from the closed
U.S. Embassy in Kabul said Wednesday.
   ``There's no support there'' among the people, Jon D. Glassman
told a news conference the day after the last 11 U.S. Embassy staff
members left the Afghan capital.
   ``The regime in many senses is like a building without its
girders,'' said Glassman, who was charge d'affaires at the embassy
for the last 18 months. ``I think there's a general consensus among
most informed observers that the life of the regime is likely to be
short.''
   In London, Afghanistan's top diplomat to Britain contended that
government forces have been stockpiling arms to defeat the
insurgents.
   ``Afghanistan will use arms it has so far refrained from using,''
Afghan Charge d'Affaires Ahmad Sarwar told a news conference at the
House of Commons. He would not elaborate.
   The Soviet Union, which sent troops to its southern neighbor nine
years ago to prop up a teetering Marxist client government, is in
the final stages of withdrawing troops who numbered 115,000 a year
ago.
   Only about 15,000 Soviet soldiers remain in Afghanistan,
according to Western and Soviet diplomats. They are to be gone by
Feb. 15 under a U.N.-sponsored accord.
   When asked how long Najib's forces can hold out against Moslem
guerrillas in the snow-covered mountains surrounding Kabul, Glassman
said: ``This is a work for a crystal ball.''
   But he added: ``In Kabul, most of the Western and neutral
diplomats are betting between now and July.''
   The United States closed its embassy on Monday, citing fears that
security will deteriorate because of the Soviet departure. The West
German Embassy shut down Saturday. Several others are expected to
follow suit within a few days and others have sharply reduced the
size of their stafs.
   Sarwar said countries that have shut their missions in Kabul had
not been in danger.
   ``We believe they are leaving as part of psychological warfare
waged against the Afghan people for the last 10 years,'' he said.
``These countries may really wish to turn Kabul ... into a land of
rubble.''
   Glassman rejected those accusations, made previously by other
Afghan government officials. ``I think the evolution of events are
foreordained already by 10 years of war, 10 years of foreign
intervention and the people's objection to that.''
   He said anyone looking for ``physical existence'' that Najib's
government is faltering need only look to the Salang Highway,
Kabul's food and fuel lifeline to the Soviet Union and Afghanistan's
fertile northern plains.
   The road can easily be blocked by the guerrillas, he said.
   On Jan. 23, Soviet and Afghan government forces launched what the
U.S. State Department described as a ``scorched earth'' policy on
villages along the Salang Highway, the only land route for Soviet
troops leaving Kabul.
   Diplomatic and guerrilla sources said hundreds of Afghan
villagers died in the coordinated campaign of bombing raids,
artillery attacks, missiles and ground assaults.
   Sarwar said the battle with the guerrilla forces of rebel
commander Ahmad Masoud followed a refusal by Masoud to keep the
highway open.
   ``It has proved to our people who our real friends are,'' Sarwar
said of the battle.
   ``Our friendship with the Soviet Union will continue on a much
warmer and wider scale,'' he added.

   The Princess of Wales swept into the Big Apple
Wednesday on her first official visit here, and her presence sent
New Yorkers, who rarely swoon over celebrities, into a royal dither.
   ``It was marvelous, quite dramatic,'' she said, when asked about
her first impressions of New York City at an evening reception.
   The 27-year-old princess arrived on a British Airways supersonic
Concorde at Kennedy International Airport at 5:49 p.m. for a
three-day visit that will show her both ends of the city's social
spectrum, the poor as well as the rich.
   Princess Diana stepped off the plane at 6 p.m., wearing a bright
blue coat trimmed with black fur cuffs and matching black
accessories. She greeted about 30 dignitaries waiting to meet her on
the airport tarmac.
   She was immediately driven to an evening party sponsored by
producers of Scottish cashmere.
   Among the guests at the reception and buffet on the 50th floor of
a Manhattan office tower were Oscar de la Renta and Donna Karan, who
design apparel for the company.
   ``She has extraordinary looks, and when you have extraordinary
looks you can wear anything,'' said de la Renta. ``With time, she
will be one of the great well-dressed ladies of the world.''
   ``She's special! She's royalty!,'' said Jack Schultz, chief
executive officer of the B. Altman &amp; Co. department store. ``You
know we don't have royalty in this country. The closest thing we
have here are movie stars and rock stars.''
   Also attending were Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin S. Traub and
Ira Neimark, the chairman and chief executive officer of the
Bergdorf Goodman department store.
   Diana wore a two-piece outfit designed by British designer
Catherine Walker, a gathered blue satin tunic over a black wool
skirt with black accessories and a pearl necklace and earrings.
   Before the princess arrived, British Consul George Finlayson
instructed the the guests on royal etiquette.
   ``For British subjects it's protocol for the men to nod and the
women can curtsy. For Americans, ever since the War of Independence,
you can do what you want,'' he said, eliciting laughter among the
150 to 200 people present.
   During her visit, Diana also will hobnob with socialite Brooke
Astor, developer Donald Trump, actor Michael Douglas, publisher
Malcolm Forbes and others of the rich-and-famous class.
   Lesser mortals were preparing for the visit by snapping up street
vendors' Very Important Princess T-shirts, Union Jacks and other
commemorative items.
   But all will not be black tie receptions for the 27-year-old
princess, said Stewart Grainger, a spokesman for the British
Information Service.
   Diana, who is traveling without husband Prince Charles or
children William and Harry, will visit a day-care center and shelter
for the homeless on Manhattan's Lower East Side on Thursday. Later
that day she'll talk about British-made toys, food, gifts and
children's clothing at F.A.O. Schwarz, the city's topmost toy store.
   Thursday night, she will see a production of ``Falstaff' at the
Welsh National Opera's American debut at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music, followed by a black-tie gala that 850 of the city's beautiful
people have paid $1,000 apiece to attend.
   On Friday, after visiting Harlem Hospital to meet with children
suffering from AIDS, the princess returns to London.
   Not everyone is thrilled with the royal visit.
   Peter King, Nassau County comptroller and chairman of the
Committee for Legal Justice in Northern Ireland, called the princess
a symbol of the crown ``and its tyranny.''
   He said 500 people would demonstrate outside the Brooklyn theater
during the performance to protest Britain's involvement in Northern
Ireland.

   Air Force personnel used numbered flags
Wednesday to map a wreckage-strewn area where a fuel-laden tanker
crashed, but the investigation may be hampered by the lack of a
flight data recorder and the apparent loss of many maintenance
records.
   All 19 people aboard the KC-135A Stratotanker died when it
crashed on takeoff about a half-mile south of a Dyess Air Force Base
runway Tuesday.
   The KC-135A tanker, based at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base in
Michigan, stopped at Dyess en route to a training mission. It was
scheduled to refuel some F-16s in the air before flying to Hawaii
and then Guam.
   The plane was was carrying military members and their dependents,
as well as 30,000 gallons of jet fuel, officials said.
   Air Force workers Wednesday used stakes and red flags to map out
about 2 square miles of scorched grassland and woods around the
crash site, said Master Sgt. Al Dostal, a Dyess spokesman.
   ``Once it's staked out, it can snow and these flags have numbers.
They can still see where things are,'' Dostal said.
   Sam Matta, an Abilene justice of the peace who spent Tuesday at
the site to record deaths, said the plane was in many pieces, the
largest of them the tail section.
   There were ``a bunch of small pieces everywhere,'' Matta said.
``There's a few big sections, 10 to 12 feet long. There's a big
wing, pretty badly burned.''
   The last two bodies were found Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, the
bodies were taken to the Dyess base hospital and the Air Force
released the victims' names.
   The flight manifest showed 17 passengers from Sawyer, and two
from Dyess, Dostal said. Seven were crew members, four were active
duty military members, four were retired military, and four were
dependents, including a boy about 7, he said. Officials said
servicemen and women, retirees and dependants are allowed to take
routine flights if space is available.
   Members of the Air Force Accident Investigation Board began
arriving at Dyess late Wednesday.
   Their investigation could be hampered by the fact that no flight
data recorder or cockpit voice recorder was aboard the modified
Boeing 707, said 1st Lt. John Ames, deputy chief of public affairs
at Dyess.
   Tech Sgt. Alan Dockery of the Strategic Air Command in Omaha,
Neb., said the recorders are not deemed necessary on flights such as
the tanker's training mission.
   Few military aircraft carry the recorders, especially older
planes such as the tanker, Dockery said. Flight recorders, known as
black boxes, weren't in use 26 years ago when the plane was built.
   He said the conversation between the plane and the Dyess traffic
control tower had been recorded at the tower and would be turned
over to investigators.
   Officials at Sawyer said the plane's maintenance files were
aboard before it crashed, and their loss also could handicap the
investigation.
   ``It's fairly common to carry maintenance records on the aircraft
when its going to be deployed for an extensive period of time, in
this case, approximately six weeks. Some of those are duplicated,
but not all. So the board will have a little harder time because
those records were being carried (on the plane),'' Sawyer spokesman
Capt. Paul Bicking said.
   One witness to the crash, Skeet Jackson, said the plane never got
more than about 60 feet off the ground, but Air Force officials
refused to speculate on what might have caused the disaster.
   ``That left wing hit the ground and (crashed) just like these
pictures of atomic bombs you've seen,'' Jackson said. ``The engines
were backfiring or popping. He (the pilot) made a sharp turn ... and
crashed.''
   Maj. Suzanne Randle, spokeswoman at Strategic Air Command
headquarters in Omaha, Neb., said the KC-135A could fly if one of
its four engines was out. Its ability to fly with even less power
would depend on a number of factors including weight, temperature,
pressure and altitude, Ms. Randle said.
   The Air Force said the plane that crashed had been in service
since 1963 and was still carrying its original Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines.The KC-135 is the backbone of the Air Force tanker fleet,
which has about 500 of them averaging 29 years of age.
   Military officials said the plane that crashed was carrying about
155,000 pounds of fuel. The KC-135A has a capacity of 187,000 pounds.

<HEAD>Three Former DEA Agents Charged With Drug Dealing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former Drug Enforcement Administration
agents, one of whom remains a fugitive, were charged Wednesday with
dealing in large quantities of cocaine and heroin and stealing drugs
from the DEA vault.
   The ex-agents previously had been charged with conspiring to
launder more than $600,000 through Swiss banks. That money was
believed connected to drug trafficking, but no drug charges had been
filed previously.
   Also Wednesday federal authorities posted a $20,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest of former agent Darnell Garcia,
41, of Palos Verdes, who has been on the run since two other agents
were arrested Nov. 22.
   Those agents, John Jackson, 39, of Claremont and Wayne
Countryman, 45, of Walnut pleaded innocent Dec. 19 to
money-laundering conspiracy and tax evasion charges. They face trial
later this year, and may be arraigned on the new charges Thursday.
   The new, 32-count indictment charges the three with dealing in
kilograms of heroin and ``hundreds of kilograms'' of cocaine. It
accuses Garcia and Jackson of stealing heroin from the DEA vault
Oct. 5, 1984 and Garcia of taking 3 pounds of heroin from the vault
Jan. 30, 1985.
   They also are accused of working with known drug dealers Mahlon
Steward and Conway and Ron Waddy. The Waddys, associated with jailed
drug kingpin Elrader Browning Jr., allegedly were hidden by Garcia
and Jackson for three days in June 1987 in an apartment rented by
the former agents.
   Garcia is charged with alerting Ron Waddy later in June 1987 that
he might soon be arrested. Prosecutors have said Garcia also is
suspected to alerting Browning, who last year was convicted of
running a California-to-Michigan cocaine and heroin ring.
   An arrest warrant also was issued Wednesday for a man named
Sherman Lair, charged in the indictment with helping the agents
distribute drugs in Los Angeles, New York, Detroit, Chicago and
elsewhere.
   Barbara Jackson, the wife of the accused former agent, also is
charged in the indictment with helping her husband launder money
through Swiss banks. She was to be summoned to court without arrest.
   Garcia, who investigators thought had fled to Europe, was seen in
early January in suburban North Hollywood, posing as an agent on a
stakeout. In another incident, he apparently used an assumed name
and posed as a DEA agent to ask Los Angeles police officers to help
him search for a man. They consented, but no one was found.
   The previous seven-count indictment, issued Dec. 7, charged the
ex-agents with hiding unreported income by transferring large
amounts of U.S. currency to Switzerland between 1984 and 1987.
   Garcia's girlfriend, Maria Zuniga, 33, has been charged with
lying to a federal grand jury when she said she had no knowledge
that Garcia maintained overseas bank accounts.
   Jackson, an agent from 1972 until his resignation in 1987, has
been held without bail, while Countryman, an agent from 1977 until
being granted disability retirement in 1986, is free on $120,000
bail.
   Garcia was an agent from 1978 until resigning in August 1987.

<TEXT>
   The leftist government reported
Honduran troops attacked a border post Wednesday. Officials extended
a unilateral cease-fire with U.S.-backed rebels and allowed two
radio news programs to return to the air.
   The Defense Ministry said Honduran troops used mortar, rocket and
rifle fire to attack a Nicaraguan army border post at Aguas
Calientes in the northern province of Nuevo Segovia. A ministry
statement did not say if there were casualties.
   Nicaraguan troops obeyed standing orders not to return fire, a
ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The Honduran government had no immediate reaction.
   President Daniel Ortega's office said Tuesday the one-month truce
extension is intended ``to make it easier for counterrevolutionary
groups to put down their weapons, accept amnesty and join the normal
life'' of the country.
   Nicaragua's Sandinista government and rebels, known as Contras,
agreed on a temporary cease-fire in March 1988. Since the failure in
June of talks to convert the agreement into a permanent truce, the
Sandinistas have declared unilateral cease-fires.
   Each side accuses the other of violations.
   The last clash was Jan. 28, when a youth and two children were
killed in Chontales province, about 125 miles east of Managua. The
Defense Ministry said they were caught in the crossfire.
   The peace talks were held as part of an agreement Nicaragua and
four other Central American countries signed in August 1987. Its
provisions include greater democracy, amnesties, a ban on use of
territory of one country by rebels of another and internal
reconciliations.
   The Interior Ministry said it had authorized two radio newscasts
to return to the air Wednesday.
   The government canceled the Radio Mundial newscast Oct. 13 for
allegedly carrying out ``a defamatory campaign against the
government.'' A program on Radio Corporacion was canceled Oct. 31
for allegedly broadcasting false information critical of the
government.

   A 3-year-old boy used as a shield during a gun
battle Wednesday was shot and seriously wounded, and police said
they later arrested a wounded man who plucked up the toddler when
the shooting started.
   The child was shot in the left arm, but the bullet traveled to
his chest, said Sgt. John Clifford, a police spokesman.
   ``The child was an innocent bystander,'' said Detective Joseph
McConville.
   The tot, whose name was not released, was in serious but stable
condition at Brookdale Hospital ater the 12:35 p.m. gunfight in the
Cypress Housing Project, in the tough East New York section of
Brookly, Clifford said.
   The toddler was with his mother, who was pushing another baby in
a stroller when at least three men began shooting at each other, but
the reasons behind the gun battle were not known, Clifford said.
   Eric Casseus, 18, who was being chased, ``picked up a
three-year-old boy and used him as a shield,'' Clifford said.
   Casseus was shot in the left foot and was treated and discharged
from Brookdale, and was charged with first-degree assault and
unlawful imprisonment, police said.

   U.S. and Honduran paratroopers began
a month of exercises Wednesday as part of joint military maneuvers
scheduled to last into July.
   Troops from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., and
about 500 Hondurans were taking part at Palmerola air base, 50 miles
northwest of Tegucigalpa.
   Between 400 and 500 U.S. troops have been rotating into Honduras
every two weeks for the exercises since the beginning of January.
   The operations include building schools, community buildings and
a road.
   The countries have conducted frequent joint exercises in Honduras
since 1982.
   Also Wednesday, police said gunmen fired on a business owned by
Ramon Custodio Lopez, president of the Honduran Human Rights
Commission. The office was vacant at the time of the attack and no
one was hurt.
   The clandestine Anticommunist Action Alliance threatened to kill
Custodio Lopez and four other rights activists for the Jan. 25
assassination of former armed forces commander Gen. Gustavo Adolfo
Alvarez Martinez, who helped Nicaraguan rebel forces in the early
1980s.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and
his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen began talks Thursday on a summit
aimed at healing the 30-year breach between Beijing and Moscow.
   ``I would now like to warmly and formally welcome you,'' Qian
said in opening remarks at the Great Hall of the People.
   After arriving Wednesday, Shevardnadze said in a written
statement in English distributed by the Soviet Embassy, ``We have
stepped on the soil of the People's Republic of China full of good
expectations and great hopes.''
   He said he hoped to finalize preparations for a meeting between
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping,
and set an exact date with the Chinese.
   Both sides have indicated they want their leaders to meet in the
first half of the year.
   ``We are convinced that the summit will open a new chapter in the
history of two neighboring countries,'' said Shevardnadze's
statement.
   He arrived on a special plane of the Soviet airline Aeroflot at
Beijing's old airport, now used only by top Chinese and foreign
leaders. He was met by Qian.
   The two men shook hands warmly as they stood bareheaded in a
biting wind.
   Shevardnadze did not read his statement, but he told reporters he
was carrying a letter from Gorbachev to Chinese leaders. He did not
reveal the contents.
   ``I reached an agreement in principle with my comrade Qian Qichen
in Moscow'' on holding a summit, he said. ``Now we're going to talk
concretely about the matter.''
   Qian's visit to Moscow in December was a ``major step forward,''
Shevardnadze said in his statement.
   Shevardnadze will fly to Shanghai on Friday for a meeting the
following day with Deng. The Chinese leader is in the east coast
city to celebrate the upcoming Lunar New Year.
   ``We are starting our negotiations fully aware of the scale of
the forthcoming event,'' said the Soviet minister. ``The title theme
of the Soviet-Chinese dialogue is peace and development.''
   The Soviets have been courting China for several years to heal
their longstanding ideological and political quarrel, but only in
the past year has China shown equal eagerness.
   This has been prompted by changed Soviet policies and a sense
that not much time remains for Deng, who is 84.
   Cambodia's 10-year occupation by Vietnam still is the chief
regional conflict at issue.
   But Vietnam, under apparent pressure from the Soviet Union, its
main ally, said last month it is willing to pull out by September.
China agreed in principle to end its aid to Cambodian rebels by then.
   Two other issues that blocked Chinese-Soviet reconciliation also
appear nearing resolution. The Soviet Union is scheduled to complete
its troop pullout from Afghanistan in two weeks and has announced
plans to withdraw some troops from Mongolia, its ally on the Chinese
border.
   The last Soviet foreign minister to visit Beijing was Andrei
Gromyko, who accompanied Nikita Khrushchev in 1959. The next year
the two countries split bitterly over leadership of the world
communist movement and a border dispute.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, arriving
Wednesday on his first visit to Latin America, discussed anti-drug
efforts with Colombia's president, declared staunch U.S. opposition
to any Latin ``debtor cartel'' and got a birthday serenade from U.S.
Embassy workers.
   The vice president arrived a day before inaugural ceremonies for
Venezuela's new president, Carlos Andres Perez. His first of several
scheduled bilateral sessions was with Virgilio Barco of Colombia.
   Quayle mostly listened as Barco talked about how much Colombia is
doing to combat drugs and guerrillas, ``and how much help they need
from the United States,'' said Quayle's press secretary, David
Beckwith.
   He said Quayle congratulated Barco on ``those courageous steps''
but pointed out that U.S. resources to help out are limited.
   Following the meeting, Quayle commented, ``We had a very good
discussion. ... I've got a very good feel'' for the Colombians'
views.
   Later Quayle met with Perez, and was to meet with outgoing
president Jaime Lusinchi before attending a reception for U.S. and
Venezuelan business leaders at the residence of Ambassador Otto
Reich.
   Quayle told reporters he viewed his trip, the first foreign
diplomatic mission for the Bush administration and Quayle's first
visit to Latin America, as a chance to meet with foreign leaders,
``to eyeball them, to get a feel where they're coming from on some
of these sensitive issues.''
   Later, addressing about 200 employees at the U.S. Embassy, he
said he had come ``to show the interest of the Bush administration
that we have in Latin America and to show our enthusiasm for the
development of democracy in Central and South America and the
Caribbean.''
   The embassy workers presented him with a birthday cake decorated
with a U.S. flag and also a cupcake that they said symbolized the
tight federal budget at home. They sang happy birthday to the vice
president, who turns 42 on Saturday.
   Entering the busy capital by motorcade, Quayle created a
cacophony of horn-honking when he decided to stop and buy some
bananas, guavas and mangoes at a small corner fruit market.
   ``Stimulating the economy already,'' he joked to reporters as he
left the market, having bought two bags of fruit.
   Quayle said on arrival that his primary mission was to be ``a
cheerleader for democracy.''
   But the massive debts owed by Venezuela and other Latin countries
was expected to dominate much of the discussion among some two dozen
heads of state attending the inauguration.
   Quayle indicated the United States is maintaining a hard line on
so-called debtor cartel movements to form a unified organization of
Third World nations that face huge national debts.
   Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Two just before landing in
Caracas, Quayle said such ideas are ``counterproductive.''
   ``We're absolutely opposed to the idea of a debtor's cartel,''
Quayle said. ``Our strong position is that a debtor cartel is a
non-starter.''
   Venezuela's new president, Perez, has indicated he will take a
leadership role on the Latin debt issue and has rejected a
coordinated effort in which the Latin countries would deal with
their creditors.
   Venezuela's debt is about $30.3 billion. On Dec. 31 the country
joined many other debtor governments and suspended payments on the
principal of most of that debt.
   Latin American countries owe more than $440 billion combined.
   Quayle said that during his talks with Perez and other leaders
the debt issue would certainly come up and he would voice U.S.
opposition to any cartel efforts.
   Quayle told reporters that he wasn't bringing ``a new initiative
from the United States'' on the debt issue. ``I will be there to
listen to their concerns.''
   He said the Bush administration is willing to hear suggestions by
the Latin leaders about how to solve the debt question.
   After their meeting, Quayle and Perez said they discussed the
debt situation, but gave no specifics.
   Quayle called the talk ``frank and candid,'' saying, ``I'm much
more informed and I appreciate the meeting.''
   They said the subject of Nicaragua also came up. Perez, who
supported the leftist Sandinistas in their 1979 overthrow of
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, has indicated he wants to take
a leadership role in helping to resolve the Nicaragua's current
strife and further the regional peace efforts spearheaded by Costa
Rican president Oscar Arias.
   A source close to Quayle said Perez and Quayle had a lively
discussion during which they agreed to disagree on the debt
question, but agreed on the need work for democracy in Nicaragua and
Panama.
   Quayle's national security adviser, Carnes Lord, said the Bush
administration is not rejecting any coordinated effort by the Latin
Americans to address their creditors. The administration would balk
at formation of an organization that would amount to a cartel, but
might be open to suggestions on other kinds of multilateral meetings.

   More than 700 Boeing jetliners operated by
every major U.S. airline must undergo a comprehensive inspection for
cross-wiring and cross-plumbing in their safety systems, after
problems were discovered in 17 aircraft.
   The Federal Aviation Administraton, in issuing the
``airworthiness directive'' late Tuesday, also noted that Boeing is
studying its design, production procedures and testing of airliner
emergency systems to see if changes are needed.
   The newly ordered tests are not expected to disrupt airline
schedules and can be completed anytime over the next 3{ weeks while
the airliners are undergoing routine maintenance.
   The order affects 741 newer jetliners flown by U.S. carriers. It
applies to all Boeing 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s built after Dec. 31,
1980. Most foreign airliners using the planes also are expected to
comply, although the FAA has no jurisdiction over them.

   A military refueling jet that crashed on
takeoff, killing all 19 aboard, appeared to veer away from a cluster
of houses before tipping onto the ground and exploding in a
mushroom-shaped fireball, witnesses said.
   ``It couldn't have been more than 50 or 60 feet off the ground,''
said Skeet Jackson, who witnessed Tuesday's crash of the
Hawaii-bound KC-135A from his back yard. ``That left wing hit the
ground and (crashed) just like these pictures of atomic bombs you've

   Officials at Dyess Air Force Base outside Abilene and at K.I.
Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette, Mich., where the flight
originated, said the passengers included spouses of military
members, retired military members and one child.
   Members of the Air Force's Accident Investigation Board were
expected to arrive at Dyess today. However, their investigation

   Thousands of black salaried General Motors Corp.
employees in three states will share in a settlement worth perhaps
$40 million, their attorneys said in announcing an agreement to end
a 6-year-old bias lawsuit.
   GM also agreed to monitor the future promotions and pay raises of
black salaried employees for five years to make sure they conform
with statistical expectations based on factors like tenure,
education, job level and age, said Dennis D. James, an attorney for
the workers.
   The agreement, which must by approved by a federal judge and
10,000 black workers in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, calls for GM to
pay $3 million, James said. But the settlement could be worth $20
million to $40 million during the next five years, he said.
   In agreeing to the proposed consent decree, GM did not admit it
had discriminated against blacks in promotions and pay raises.

   Soviet soldiers smiled and waved as
their convoy left Kabul for home today on the strategic Salang
Highway, an Afghan government spokesman said. Heavy shelling could
be heard just up the road.
   At dawn, the convoy moved through a checkpoint about two miles
from the capital, en route to the Soviet border 250 miles miles
away, said an interior ministry spokesman who identified himself
only as Hamad.
   The spokesman said the convoy, mostly made up of trucks carrying
up to 50 soldiers each, took 50 minutes to pass through the
checkpoint.
   ``They were happy to be leaving. They were smiling and waving,''
he said.

   The Soviet Union is trying to finance its
reforms with loans from the West while postponing tough decisions
needed at home to curb its budget deficit, says the author of a new
book on the Soviet economy.
   Author Judy Shelton has joined a chorus of skeptics, including
many on Capitol Hill, who worry that Western banks and governments
are extending credits to the Kremlin without reviewing the strategic
implications.
   Shelton's new book, ``The Coming Soviet Crash: Gorbachev's
Desperate Pursuit of Credit in Western Financial Markets,'' includes
a detailed analysis of published Soviet budget data.
   She concluded that Kremlin accountants have been fudging the
country's economic figures for years, steadily reporting budget
surpluses when in fact there were growing deficits. The Soviets
finally admitted to a budget deficit last October.

   The ``First Lady of Irish Radio'' has been chosen
as the first female grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade in
its 226-year history.
   And Dorothy Hayden Cudahy _ who accepted the honor with smilin'
Irish eyes, not tearful ones _ says it's about time.
   Mrs. Cudahy, 66, had been passed over in favor of a man in three
previous years before she was elected Tuesday night to lead the
200,000 marchers in the nation's largest and oldest St. Patrick's
Day celebration.
   Afterward, she said Irish women have too often been left standing
in the wings while men took center stage.

   By the time he was 25, Gary Martin was an
American success story, a poor black kid from Alabama who earned
degrees from Harvard College and Columbia Law School, clerked for a
federal judge and landed a job with a big Miami law firm.
   At 28, he was a story of another kind _ a homeless Ivy Leaguer
wandering the streets of New York, dressed in rags, fishing through
trash cans. Finally, friends and former classmates hunted him down
and convinced him to enter a counseling facility.
   Three years later, Gary Martin's story lacks a neat ending. At
31, he is neither back on the fast track nor back on the street.
   After living for several years in an apartment provided by The
Bridge Inc., a mental health rehabilitation agency, Martin moved
back to his mother's home in Phenix City, Ala.
   He spent two months working as a part-time law clerk, but says he
has no immediate plans to try to resume his career.
   In a telephone interview, Martin said he was ``pretty much just
trying to get used to being around here again.''
   ``Getting to see home again is nice,'' he said. ``It's quiet down
here. New York can be kind of a wild place.''
   It was a wild place for Martin, who arrived in spring 1985. Soon
after that his money ran out, but exactly what drove him onto the
street remains unclear; although he appears to have been depressed,
he has described the period as a sort of urban camping experience.
   Martin's problems seem to have begun in Miami, where he lost his
$42,000-a-year job after twice flunking the Florida bar exam. He
moved in with some relatives in Wilmington, Del., and began a job
search. When things didn't work out Martin headed to New York, where
he had attended law school.
   After friends who had spotted him on the street obtained a court
order for his apprehension, Martin agreed to accept room and
counseling from The Bridge.
   For a month, the homeless lawyer was news. Homeless advocates
said his case showed the breadth of the problem; people who learned
of his plight offered money or jobs, although Martin clearly was in
no condition to take advantage of the latter.
   Since returning to Phenix City, his only job has been a brief
stint in the office of attorney Michael Bellamy. Bellamy identified
with Martin when he read about him in the newspaper three years ago;
he, too, had flunked the bar exam the first time he took it.
   Martin, he said, ``did an excellent job. ... I gave him a brief
to do, and it was apparent he was real smart.''
   But Bellamy said he could not afford to keep a clerk; Martin
himself said the work there was ``not the best use for my type of
law background.''
   He said he might take the bar exam again and try to get a job
with a small law firm or a public interest organization, preferably
in Atlanta or another large city.
   Martin still doesn't readily admit to having had a psychological
problem. Asked about his time on the street, he calls it ``an odd
situation. ... I was just trying to deal with a tough situation. ...
I've always been kind of a self-sufficient person.''
   George McDonald, a homeless advocate who helped link Martin up
with The Bridge, said Martin ``always felt above everything there.''
In Phenix City, he has rebuffed suggestions that he seek counseling.
   McDonald says this is not remarkable; many homeless people must
struggle to regain their equilibrium.
   But in another respect, he said, Martin is unusual: ``He got
help.''

<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after gaining the convictions of
338 mobsters in Italy's so-called ``maxitrial,'' a government drive
against the Mafia has lost momentum.
   Since those verdicts, the Mafia seems to have moved a step or
more ahead of the state as the mob schemes to safeguard its
interests, which include billion-dollar international drug
trafficking and control of lucrative public contracts in developing
southern Italy.
   Investigators also suspect the king of the Corleone crime family
_ there actually is one _ comes and goes as he pleases in Palermo,
Sicily's capital and largest city.
   The last photograph investigators have of the Corleone leader,
Salvatore Riina, is 30 years old, and for all they know, the man
believed to be the most powerful Mafioso in Sicily today, probably
has had plastic surgery to change his looks.
   Alberto Di Pisa, the chief anti-Mafia prosecutor, notes that the
Sicilians' fear of Mafia revenge and their mistrust of the state
make it unlikely an ordinary citizen would turn Riina in.
   The Corleone family gets its name from a Sicilian town. The
American author Mario Puzo used that name for the main character in
his novel ``The Godfather'' and it was used as well in Godfather
movies. While the Corleone clan has its roots in the town, its power
base is believed to have shifted to Palermo.
   The claim that Riina moves boldly and openly in parts of Palermo
was made on state television recently by Salvatore ``Totuccio''
Contorno, a Mafioso-turned-informer. His testimony helped convict
the 338 defendants, many of them top mob bosses, on murder, drug and
other charges in Italy's largest-ever case against the mob.
   The interview was made in the United States where Contorno lives
under a secret identity provided by U.S. authorities after he
testified for them.
   Italian investigators ruefully acknowledge that the state of the
anti-Mafia front in Italy is so dismal that Contorno's claim may
well be true.
   Among the setbacks in the past year in the war against the mob:
   _The slaying of Judge Antonio Saetta, who had been assigned to
hear the appeals of the maxitrial this year. The Mafia this decade
has assassinated several investigating magistrates but until Saetta
was killed the mob left presiding judges alone.
   _A court ruling that prosecutors can't automatically try mob
suspects in one mass trial on the sole basis that the Mafia is
directed by a Palermo-based ``commission,'' which the state did in
the maxitrial. Prosecutors say the ruling weakens their ability to
present stronger, more comprehensive cases that are more likely to
hurt big-time mob bosses.
   For many prosecutors and police officials, the appointment of
Domenico Sica as the high commissioner against the Mafia was
virtually the only bright spot. Sica earned national fame as a
prosecutor assigned top domestic and international terrorist cases.
   But Sica, in a speech in January summing up his first six months
as Italy's top anti-Mafia fighter, complained that he needs more
experienced consultants and said the quality of information from a
special intelligence unit at his disposal was unsatisfactory.
   ``We can't provide a detailed picture of the Mafia today,'' said
Guido Lo Forte, an investigating magistrate, in a recent interview
in Palermo's Palace of Justice.
   He said the mob now appears to be circulating less and less
important information within its ranks one way of eliminating the
risk of witnesses.
   At the same time, the lack of a government witness protection
program discourages potential informants. Two of informant
Contorno's brothers-in-law were killed by the mob in Palermo in
recent months.
   What investigators would especially like to know is new Mafia
strategies for avoiding tightened financial checks.
   ``Iron Tower,'' a joint U.S.-Italian investigation, disclosed in
December that South American cocaine was being sent to Italy in
exchange for heroin, some of it shipped in liquified form in wine
bottles.
   According to investigators, such bartering avoids incriminating
bank records.
   Authorities say the Sicilian mob's share of worldwide drug trade
has declined in the past few years. One reason is U.S. and Italian
prosecution; the other is competition from South American and Asian
crime syndicates.
   ``The biggest chunk of Mafia earnings today comes from political
corruption and public contracts,'' says Pino Arlacchi, a sociologist
who studies organized crime.
   Laws were enacted in the early 1980s requiring those bidding for
public contracts to prove they had no Mafia links, but Lo Forte says
the mob got around the restrictions in some cases by intimidating
``clean'' Sicilian businessmen to front for Mafia enterprises.
   Prosecutors also say that since the investigation that led to the
maxitrial, police work has yielded nothing of real substance; four
top anti-Mafia detectives were slain by the mob in the last few
years.
   The Mafia is also believed to traffic in arms, but investigators
say that business is minimal compared to drug operations. Right-wing
terrorists have been linked to the Mafia in alleged arms dealings,
but the relationship remains murky, and some investigators say it
appears to be overstated.
   In late January, Italian authorities announced they issued 72
arrest warrants in connection with an international ring in which
the Sicilian mob and right-wing extremists work together in drug and
weapons trafficking. Among those arrested in raids was Michele
Cillari, considered the Corleone family's ``cashier'' for his
financial dealings.

<HEAD>Methodists Sound Religious Refrain Not To Intervene In Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another religious voice _ this time from U.S. and
Latin American Methodist bishops _ has sounded a plea to governments
to keep hands off Nicaragua and be ``peacemakers and not
peacebreakers.''
   After extensive talks there, the bishops this week declared
``peace with justice'' is possible, but must recognize ``each
nation's right to determine its own destiny'' without interference.
   This is a long standing demand of most major Christian
leadership, Protestant and Roman Catholic, in opposing outside
mililtary intervention in strife-torn Central America.
   President Bush says review of policy there and elsewhere still is
to be completed and it takes ``a little time,'' particularly since
he wants a ``bilaterally supported policy'' there.
   His chosen secretary of state, James A. Baker III, says he
doesn't think that ``on humanitarian grounds or moral grounds we can
abandon the Contras,'' but should go slow on any more military aid
to the rebel group.
   ``I think it's very, very, important that we move in a unified
way here,'' he said.
   These remarks last week _ Bush in a news conference and Baker to
a Senate committee _ indicated new efforts to avoid the past keen
partisan conflict over the matter, and possibly new approaches to it.
   Bishop Kenneth W. Hicks of Topeka, Kan., among those visiting
Nicaragua, expressed hope the Bush administration will take a
``diplomatic rather than confrontational approach'' toward Nicaragua.
   This has been a drawn-out, keenly divisive issue in America,
engendering demonstrations, passions on right and left, long
congressional battles and narrow votes.
   It has involved secret CIA mining of Nicaragua's harbor, U.S.
provisions of arms to Contra rebels, and after such aid was
suspended, a scandal over continuing it through illegal military
sales to Iran.
   During the eight-year civil war there since the Sandinistas
toppled a 40-year dictatorship, both mainline Protestant
denominations and the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have steadily
opposed outside military intervention.
   The Methodist bishops _ 16 from the U.S. United Methodist Church
and 15 from Latin American countries _ condemned the ``violence and
violations against the people'' of Central American nations as
making peace impossible.
   In a ``declaration of peace and solidarity'' issued last Sunday
in Nicaragua's capital, Managua, after five days of discussions with
a wide range of Nicaraguans, high and low, the bishops pledged:
   ``We will demand and expect that our governments act with
compassion and justice. ... We will publicly challenge our
governments to be peacemakers and not peacebreakers. ...
   ``We will work for the development of policies that respect the
sovereign rights of other nations to govern themselves without
interference.''
   The bishops, representing the U.S. Council of United Methodist
Bishops and the Episcopal Council of Methodist Churches in Latin
America, said they have seen Nicaragua's war devastation and they
urged negotiated settlements.
   Similar stands have been taken over the years by various mainline
denominations, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Episcopal and other bodies,
as well as by the Protestant-Orthodox National Council of Churches
and Catholic bishops.
   They have supported U.S. humanitarian aid, but not military
supplies. The national council's governing board said last May such
aid should be ``offered impartially, strictly on the basis of need,
free from extraneous objective.''
   Monsignor Daniel Hoye, secretary of the U.S. Catholic Conference,
says the bishops object to any aid to the Contras except such
humanitarian aid as food, clothing and resettlement assistance while
the peace process develops.
   The Methodist bishops added another point, noting crippling debts
of Central American countries and urging ``swift renegotiation of
these debts with favorable terms,'' or total debt forgiveness.
   Hicks said, ``The United States has a marvelous opportunity to
help a country find its way. For eight years our policy has been
that help must conform to our provisions and Nicaragua is not
willing to do that.
   ``If we want them to move out of the Marxist bloc then we have to
treat them as equals ... instead of as underprivileged children that
need to be disciplined and chastized.''
   Bishop C. P. Minnick of Raleigh, N.C., said there was confusion
among Nicaraguans about why the United States as ``one nation under
God'' would stand by and send no aid after the recent destructive
hurricane.
   However, he said the country seems more relaxed than when he
visited there with a fact-finding church delegation in 1985. ``Now
there is not as much anxiety about terrorist (Contra) activity.''

   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev meets the
ultimate capitalist, J.R. Ewing?
   If Larry Hagman has his way, the meeting will become a reality in
March when ``Dallas'' is tentatively scheduled to go on location in
the Soviet Union and Europe.
   Hagman, as well as regulars Patrick Duffy, Cathy Podewell, Sheree
J. Wilson and George Kennedy, are tentatively scheduled to leave in
March _ the final decision has not yet been made. If it's a go, they
will film scenes for ``Dallas'' in the Soviet Union, Austria and
West Germany.
   ``I have no idea what the story will be,'' said Hagman, who this
season became co-executive producer of the series with Leonard
Katzman. ``I don't think we'll know until Leonard finishes scouting
the locations.
   ``But, Russia exports more oil than any other country, including
Saudi Arabia and Iran. It's their only source of hard dollars. So I
think J.R. may do a little dealing.''
   And might J.R. seek an audience with Gorbachev? ``Don't think we
aren't trying! If we could just touch flesh just once. I'm all for
it.''
   It wouldn't be the first overseas trip for ``Dallas,'' now in its
12th season. Victoria Principal and Linda Gray went to Hong Kong a
few seasons ago.
   ``It'll be fun,'' said Hagman. ``It'll generate some interest.''
   Hagman became co-executive producer in September, a title offered
by Lorimar Television, but he acknowledges it's mainly an excuse.
``They had to find some way to pay me more money,'' he said. ``It
was a means of paying me the executive producer's salary, if you
want to know the truth.''
   Hagman declined to say what his salary is but said an estimate by
``Entertainment Tonight'' that he was making $150,000 a week was
below the mark.
   The title ``makes me feel more powerful,'' he said, laughing. ``I
did pick my new leading lady this year. I auditioned all the women
and selected Cathy Podewell. She's a joy.''
   J.R. married Cally Harper, played by Podewell, earlier this
season in a shotgun wedding.
   Discussing how long he would stay with ``Dallas,'' Hagman said,
``It's a sinecure, let's face it. I enjoy it and I make a lot of
money. I work three days a week and laugh all day long. They pay me
what some countries make. Why move on? The chance of another TV show
making it is awfully tough, and at my age, why risk it?
   ``And why should I go into movies? I don't know of any movie
actor who makes as much as I do. I'm willing to stay with `Dallas'
as long as it goes on. We entertain people. Millions of people watch
this show.''
   Hagman has used his influence, both as star and co-executive
producer, to change the direction of ``Dallas.'' He was instrumental
in persuading Patrick Duffy to return to the show and in getting
Charlene Tilton back in her role as Lucy.
   Duffy left in 1985 after Bobby Ewing was struck and killed by an
automobile. Hagman felt the tension between J.R. and Bobby was
missed. Duffy returned in 1986 in the famous ``dream'' episode, in
which his death _ and the entire season _ were explained away as a
dream by Pamela Ewing. Victoria Principal, who played Pamela, has
since left the series. Hagman also tried to get her to return.
   ``I wanted to get the show back to the family,'' said Hagman. ``I
think it's best when we're all together. The reason Bobby and J.R.
went to Arkansas, where J.R. ended up getting married, was to get us
out and doing something physical.
   ``It got us out of sitting around the boardroom making deals.
There'll still be that undercurrent, but it has to be interesting.
Maybe we can make a deal with the Russians.''
   Has J.R. changed over the years? ``As an actor you sometimes
paint yourself into corner you don't anticipate until later,'' he
answered. ``J.R.'s not as raw as he was. He's still amorous. He
married this young girl.''

<HEAD>Bush Honeymoon Sweet, Save for a Few Ripples</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They used to call him wimp, but as a beaten
Democratic rival tells it, George Bush is so tough now that he can
gargle with water from Boston Harbor.
   That's Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's joke, and it tells of the
transformation that accompanies a political honeymoon. President
Bush is enjoying his, but he's been around _ he knows it won't last.
   ``I don't expect it's all going to be sweetness and harmony and
light,'' he said. He addresses Congress one week from tonight,
filling in blanks on his agenda, especially on the budget deficit.
   ``The minute we get those proposals up there ... I expect we're
going to have other firestorms swirling around,'' he said.
   The big bills run up by the government during the Ronald Reagan
era are coming due and there is no painless way to pay them.
   That surely will lead to some partisan spats, but it doesn't mean
the honeymoon will be over. Presidential honeymoons with Congress
usually last well into warm weather in Washington and end gradually,
issue by issue.
   Gerald R. Ford, the unelected president, was an exception. He had
a month's harmony and then pardoned Richard M. Nixon for Watergate.
   Not long ago there were suggestions that Bush wouldn't get a
honeymoon at all, not after the long, often negative presidential
campaign. The Democrats surely wouldn't forget that. They did,
almost immediately.
   ``The change in George Bush is impressive,'' Bentsen, the
Democratic vice presidential nominee, said at a stag, black-tie
dinner last Saturday night. ``This time last year he was being
called a wimp. Now he's so tough he gargles with water from Boston
Harbor.'' Bush was there to laugh at the ribbing about his campaign
television commercial blaming Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis for
pollution in Boston Harbor.
   Bush said during the transition that campaign bitterness wouldn't
last. ``Nobody remembers campaigns, ads about Willie Horton,'' he
said then. ``The country's looking forward.''
   But the early Bush honeymoon has been smoother than he could have
expected. It has been a time harmony and calm, save for what Bush
called a few ripples. One followed an administration suggestion that
a fee on bank depositors might be the way to pay the price of the
savings and loan crisis. Another was stirred by conservative
Republicans who questioned whether Bush's nominee to head the
Department of Health and Human Services really opposes abortion. He
said he does.
   Actually, the flap over fees for an S&amp;L bailout could serve the
administration's interests. That unpopular idea was floated early in
the process; alternatives could look better by comparison. And the
abortion controversy had more to do with conservative orthodoxy than
with substance.
   Cabinet confirmation proceedings in the Senate have produced more
Democratic praise than pointed criticism. In the House, Speaker Jim
Wright said he will not press Senate-approved legislation that would
compel presidents to advise Congress within 48 hours of covert
intelligence operations, holding off on ``a mutual assumption of
good faith'' with the new administration.
   Of such assumptions are honeymoons made.
   President Reagan's was different, since he held the political
shotgun when he came to power in 1981. Republicans had captured the
Senate and strengthened their House minority. Reagan was as powerful
a campaigner in office as out. He got Congress to do his bidding by
keeping the pressure on.
   Democrats kept pronouncing the Reagan honeymoon over, but he kept
winning. It was mid-summer when his tax cut bill came to a final
vote in the House, and the president won decisively after a
televised bid for support that swamped congressmen with telephone
calls and telegrams.
   ``Never in my 30 years here have I see that kind of pressure,''
said former Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.
   President Carter had a shaky honeymoon in unfamiliar territory.
He was the outsider and he tended to handle Congress that way, even
though it was dominated by fellow Democrats.
   His first nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency had to
withdraw or risk rejection by a Democratic Senate.
   His early travels and appointments were set without advance word
to Democrats from the state involved. He took on powerful
congressional interests in an effort to cut back federal rivers and
harbors projects and wound up with half the cut he sought, after a
long and politically costly battle.
   While most of his major proposals were approved, it never was an
easy partnership.

enabling investors nationwide to track stock portfolios via cable
television instead of relying on brokerages.
   Jeff Blokker and Eric Randall, co-founders of CableSoft, said
their product Live Wire consists of a specially designed computer
keyboard that, when hooked to cable TV, finds the Financial News
Network channel.
   It reads the ticker tape that runs across the bottom of the
television screen, quoting prices of stocks from the New York Stock
Exchange, American Stock Exchange and over-the-counter stocks. The
device converts the characters from the TV screen and relays them to
the user's personal computer screen.
   Besides tracking a particular stock, a Live Wire user also can
program at what price to buy or sell. An alarm bell rings when that
threshold is reached, Blokker said. The device also can make
long-term stock earnings calculations, he said.
   To comply with Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines,
there is a 15-minute delay from the time the quotes are issued by
stock exchanges and the time they first appear on FNN.
   But Blokker called that a minor disadvantage since most investors
get delayed stock information anyway from their brokers. CableSoft's
Live Wire product costs about $1,000, he said, ``a one-time cost.''.
   ``Anyone who does interday trading, on the average of more than
five trades on a single day, then you need real-time data. If you
trade once a day, a 15-minute delay data is fine,'' Blokker said.
   Most personal investors, he said, are now utilizing information
services such as Dow Jones News Retrieval or CompuServe once a night
to get stock quotes, which they enter into their personal computers.
   But CableSoft's co-founders say their service is better because
it provides quotes during the entire day.
   CableSoft unveiled Live Wire this past summer at a trade show in
New York.
   ``They said we were the hit of the show because we were something
new _ brand-new and totally unique,'' Blokker said.
   The idea for Live Wire surfaced when Blokker was working toward a
doctoral degree in electrical engineering at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, he said. He left school to join Randall
in a separate business venture that eventually collapsed.
   ``We sat around for about a week wondering, `What should we do
now?' So I remembered this old idea, and we decided to try it,''
Blokker said.
   Blokker said he figured it would take about a year before they
could start marketing Live Wire, but it took four years instead.
   CableSoft, headquartered in a blue, three-story, 10-room house in
Fairfield, has 16 employees. Each Live Wire machine is still made
individually, but mass production is planned soon via a contract
with Vantronics, a San Jose, Calif. manufacturing concern.
   CableSoft began marketing Live Wire several months ago and has
sold about 200 machines so far, Blokker said. He envisioned big
sales because there are an estimed 2 million people using personal
computers to follow stocks.
   ``If we can penetrate that market, if we get 10 percent of that
market, that means we've sold 200,000 units. That's $200 million in
cash flow. That's a lot of money,'' he said.

<HEAD>Criticizing The Old Measures of Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In recent weeks some of the economy's biggest
fears, including those all-American worries about big trade and
budget deficits, have been attacked by critics as being overdrawn.
   Budget deficits, they point out, are no higher now than in many
other years when measured as a percentage of gross national product.
Besides, unless we go on another spending spree, they say, we might
even tame the beast in the 1990s.
   And, it is argued, the equally worrisome trade deficit already is
on the way to being alleviated if not corrected, with export orders
building and American companies showing daily evidence that they are
competitive again.
   On a larger scale, serious questions have been raised about the
inevitability of the economic cycle. Isn't it just ``economic
nature'' for expansions to be followed by recessions? Maybe not,
some now say.
   Some of the reasoning in regard to the less-cyclical nature of
the economy is interesting if not convincing. Rather than having
national or global downturns, it is argued, we have downturns
limited to regions or industries.
   There is evidence, for example, that this very thing might have
occurred in the U.S. economy over the past six years or so. We
avoided a national recession, it is said. Instead, regional
downturns relieved the pressure.
   Two years ago, for instance, many areas dependent on oil, mining,
agriculture and certain types of manufacturing were indeed in
recession, but national statistics didn't show it because of East
and West coast booms.
   Thus, for official purposes, the country never had a traditional
recession in this period. But sensible economic minds and millions
of Americans know very well that recessionary conditions existed for
much of the country.
   Have the definitions and rules changed?
   Old-timers will tell you that to toss out the old rules and the
traditional assumptions is a step toward disaster. Just as soon as
you get ready to abandon the old guidelines, they say, the old
guidelines reassert themselves.
   They observe, for example, that abandonment of old measures of
values often accompany every explosive bull market in stocks, only
to be embraced again as prices plunge back to reality.
   Still, there remains an important area where existing measures
might indeed be out of whack. Americans, it has been said for
decades, are among the world's worst savers, putting away only a
fraction of what the Japanese save.
   From 1982 to 1987 the U.S. savings rate was a mere 3.7 percent of
gross national product, compared with several times that in Japan.
Americans, it was said, were squandering their income instead of
investing it in progress.
   But several economists point out that demographics might have had
something to do with this low rate. And others, most recently
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, suggest the definition of
savings might be incorrect.
   Edward Yardeni, Prudential-Bache director of economics, contends
the baby boom bulge in the population, a phenomenon that is destined
to disappear, has skewed the conventional savings rate.
   As the baby boomers _ born after World War II _ grow older they
will become less active spenders, he says. Their big expenses for
education, housing and the like will have been met; they will have
the ability and desire to save.
   So convinced is he that this thesis is correct, Yardeni has gone
way out on a limb, forcasting a sharp rise in the savings rate from
4 percent or so to 10 percent over the next five years.
   Paul Craig Roberts, former Treasury assistant secretary, argues
that there are methodological quirks in the calculation of savings
rate. And now Greenspan adds further doubts about the accuracy of
official savings rates.
   Greenspan's question concerns a situation that, at least on the
surface, appears to be contradictory. Down payments by buyers of
houses are counted as savings, but capital gains received by sellers
of houses are not.
   Count those capital gains received by sellers of homes that have
multiplied in value, and you might see a very different savings rate
for Americans. And a lot less criticism of their profligacy.

<HEAD>Reopened Just over a Year Ago, Phillipines Congress Hit by Scandals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Closed down by President Ferdinand E.
Marcos in 1972 and reopened just over a year ago, the Philippines
Congress now is swept up in scandals.
   Hardly had the dust settled on a scandal involving firearms
imports when members of the House of Representatives were facing
charges of trying to corner the export of coconuts to Taiwan.
   The Senate also has come under fire for deciding to use
taxpayers' money to buy 35 foreign luxury cars for each of its 23
members and certain staff.
   Just before the coconut scandal broke in late January, columnist
Neal Cruz of the Daily Globe wrote that the rubber-stamp congressmen
during Marcos' time ``look like saints compared to the members of
(this) Congress.''
   ``First, some gunrunners in the House of Representatives import
hundreds of high-powered automatic firearms for the protection of
congressmen _ and the rest for the lucrative black market,'' he
added. ``Just as the public heaved a collective sigh of relief that
... the senators are not involved in this caper comes the revelation
that all 23 senators have ordered new cars.''
   The coconut scandal exploded Jan. 25 when the chairman of the
Philippine Coconut Authority claimed at least 12 congressmen were
pressuring his organization to grant them exclusive rights to export
4,500 tons of fresh coconut to Taiwan.
   Jose Romero said the congressmen, from four coconut-growing
provinces south of Manila, were insisting that the authority not
only restore a quota system it had recently scrapped but also to
partition the coconut export quota among themselves.
   He said that until last year, his agency awarded the entire quota
to a group of Filipino exporters but decided three months ago to
stop the practice because of complaints from other groups. The move
was also in line with the government's policy of deregulation.
   The congressmen, led by Rep. Leonardo Guerrero, claimed they
simply were trying to protect the interests of small coconut farmers
in their provinces from middlemen they claim had monopolized the
export in the past.
   Guerrero, chairman of the House Sub-Committee on Edible Crops,
denied Romero's charges and accused him of receiving bribes from
middlemen.
   The uproar over the firearms scandal is not over, even though the
200-member House cleared two congressmen of wrongdoing in the
importation of more than 600 Israeli-made Uzi and Galil automatic
rifles.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the imports lacked permits
from his department; customs officials said other regulations were
broken.
   Nevertheless, after a closed special session, the House ruled
that the two congressmen who brokered the importation did not commit
any improprieties. The House voted, however, to turn the weapons
over to the military ``in response to public opinion.''
   Reps. Rodrigo Gutang and Renato Unico, both retired military
officers, said the guns were to have been paid for by the
congressmen with their own money. They said the legislators needed
the weapons to defend themselves from rising crime and threats from
communist rebels.
   As the gun controversy raged, someone leaked the Senate's
decision to buy 35 new cars. The public uproar was immediate, with
most comment accusing the senators of callousness in light of
widespread poverty.
   Callers to television and radio programs threatened to stone
senators in their new cars. One woman offered cash rewards to people
who actually did so.
   A few senators dropped the idea following the uproar, but Senate
President Jovito Salonga and other senators insist that public
officials have a right to have official vehicles.
   Other scandals to hit the House involved pork barrel funds and
other allowances.
   Last year, House Speaker Ramon Mitra handed an envelope
containing 20,000 pesos ($1,000) to a member of the congressional
press corps on the eve of the legislature's Christmas recess.
   Some newspapers immediately assailed the move as an attempt to
buy off the press. Mitra said, however, the money was given in lieu
of a ``traditional blowout'' congress gives reporters after passing
the national budget.
   The money was eventually spent by Mitra on a dinner for the
entire press corps.

<HEAD>``New Age'' Recycles Old Ideas Of Divinized Natural Forces</HEAD>

   On a leather strap around the young woman's neck
hung a plum-sized chunk of quartz.
   ``It puts a circle of power around you that keeps you feeling
protected,'' said Marybeth Stroebel of Jersey City, N. J., a graphic
artist for a Manhattan advertising firm.
   ``The crystal shields you,'' she said. ``If you know how to get
in tune with it, it helps you be more safe and calm when you
encounter some unpleasant situation. It's electromagnetic, you
know.''
   Such minute energy pervades the known universe, including every
piece of earth, but an esoteric view of the New Age movement is that
quartz crystals give off a soothing, guarding aura.
   This is among an effusion of the movement's exotic ideas _
extra-terrestrial beings, reincarnation, out-of-body experiences,
``rebirthing tanks,'' mantras and ``channeling'' wisdom from the
ancients.
   It's ``a hybrid mix,'' says Russell Chandler, author of one of
the most comprehensive, balanced books yet on the movement,
``Understanding the New Age,'' issued by Word Publishing.
   ``Some of its kookier fads may have peaked and be passing,'' he
said in an interview. ``But the fallout of New Age thinking and its
impact is going to be around for a long time.
   ``Many of its subtleties have penetrated the entire culture. It's
very attractive and seductive, promising quick spirituality. Its
eclectic appeal resonates with a lot of people in our pluralistic
society.''
   He said the movement's key premise, ``in simple terms, is that
everything is God and God is everything and we can become God.
That's the point of all the techniques to attain altered states of
consciousness.''
   Asked if such playing God wasn't the biblical wrongdoing of Adam
and the Tower of Babel _ and of tyrants of history _ Chandler said
it was. ``It's all right there in the opening chapters of Genesis.''
   However, he said New Agers don't see God in the Judeo-Christian
sense as a supremely personal sovereign who reveals his truth
through history, but as an impersonal ``it,'' an ``energy force that
penetrates the universe.''
   ``God is a sort of loose energy ball rattling around the
universe,'' Chandler said. ``Of course, you can't derive the Ten
Commandments or any ultimate standards from a loose energy ball.''
   He terms such ``moral relativism'' a fault of the movement,
saying its notion of reincarnation puts ``a different spin on lying,
stealing, adultery, even murder,'' since victims are assumed coming
back unhurt in another life.
   However, Chandler emphasized that the movement is varying and
fluid. ``You sign no creed. People buy into it at different
levels,'' he said, espousing only bits or much of it.
   ``It has no coherent organization or headquarters that issues
pronouncements or any single leadership,'' he said.
   But it does have key theoreticians and ``hard-core strategists,''
he said, and is promoted in psychic fairs, seminars, therapies and
publications, its ideas sprinkling TV and movie fare and even
business motivational training.
   ``Shirley MacLaine is kind of the high priestess of the
movement,'' he said, noting that her TV appearances and books made
most people aware of it.
   Its slogan: ``You create your own reality.''
   Chandler, 56, an award-winning religion writer for the Los
Angeles Times, took an eight-months leave for researching the
movement, interviewing both its critics and fervent followers.
   He says it holds that ``everything is one vast, interconnected
process,'' that the ``cosmos is pure energy,'' that ``all is one,''
that individuals can attain ``higher selves'' and the world gain
unified harmony.
   ``Humanity is deified, death is denied and ignorance _ not evil _
is the enemy,'' Chandler writes of the movement.
   He says New Agers believe the world nears a ``profound
breakthrough'' when the ``limited, finite Old Order will give way to
a glorious, unlimited New Order of peace, prosperity and
perfection.''
   ``Thousands of New Age activists seek to transform society
through New Age precepts,'' he writes. As the year 2000 approaches,
he adds, ``New Age millenial expectations will likely crescendo to
fever pitch.''
   Although seeming new, he says the movement's core ideas stem from
2,500-year-old Buddhism's view of ``higher consciousness'' or ``true
self'' and 3,500-year-old Hinduism's view of death-rebirth cycles
toward blissful oneness.
   He says the movement reflects other old influences such as
primitive animism's deifying of nature, the ancient heresy of
gnosticism, claiming divine ``knowing,'' and old-time seances
renamed ``channeling''
   It's all ``recycled and dressed up in Madison Avenue clothes to
appeal to our age now,'' Chandler commented.
   He sees some positive elements in the movement _ its emphasis on
cooperation, on protecting the earth, on internationalism and peace,
on ``right-brain'' intuitive thinking, on bodily health through
exercise and good food.
   It ``is neither the hellish conspiracy that fundamentalist
critics charge, nor the utopian bliss its fondest supporters
imagine,'' Chandler writes.
   He says ``the insidious danger of the New Age'' is its view of
reality as being without absolutes. ``History provides evidence that
relative standards of morality breed chaos and _ ultimately _ the
downfall of society.''

   Janet Mondlane, educated in a one-room
schoolhouse near Downer's Grove, Ill., was 17 and dreaming of
becoming a doctor in Africa when she met an African revolutionary at
a summer church camp.
   He changed her life.
   It was 1951, and Eduardo Mondlane, who became the founder and
first president of the Mozambican Liberation Front, was 31 and
lecturing at church camps as part of his scholarship to Oberlin
College in Ohio.
   ``I am a product of Eduardo Mondlane,'' says his widow, 55, who
heads the Red Cross in Mozambique, still wracked by war and famine
14 years after independence from Portugal and 20 years after her
husband's assassination.
   ``I grew up in this little town near Chicago. Until I was 7 I
lived out in the country,'' the former Janet Rae Johnson recalled in
an interview. ``Life was calm, very stable, not many ideas were
passing through.''
   She said, ``Eduardo was able to write on a blank sheet and he
wrote on it until the time he died.''
   On Feb. 3, 1969, Mondlane was killed by a parcel bomb at his
office in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, where the revolutionary movement
_ known by its Portuguese acronym, Frelimo _ was headquartered
during the war against the Portuguese.
   ``During the whole long struggle every now and then you had to
pick up the children and leave the house in the middle of the night
because word came that someone was coming to attack,'' Mrs. Mondlane
said.
   ``I'm not at all a violent person. As a matter of fact I'm rather
a passivist. But my life has been very much linked with war,
unfortunately.''
   Her work as head of the Mozambican Red Cross involves providing
emergency aid for millions of refugees displaced by fighting between
the Frelimo government, which took power in 1975 under a Marxist
constitution, and guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance,
supported for many years by the white-minority governments of South
Africa and what then was Rhodesia.
   Mrs. Mondlane said she is not a Marxist but is a member of the
Frelimo Party and a deputy in the People's Assembly, the national
legislature.
   Today's Mozambique is not what she had expected, she said.
   ``I never counted on so much war, that's for sure. We thought
that it would be possible to develop the country. It hasn't been.''
   A major decision of her life was relinquishing her American
citizenship.
   ``The rest of my family is in the States. It's a question of do
you break these ties or don't you, really throw in the lot or not?
   ``I decided yes, this is really my country. I really dedicated my
life to this country since I met Eduardo, and that's a long time ago.
   ``I went to the church camp in Geneva, Wis., and there was
Eduardo. We students were supposed to go to a different lecture
every day. I went to the lecture Monday on Africa and stayed there.
I was just mesmerized.''
   She and Mondlane exchanged letters for the next 18 months. After
high school graduation she went to Marianhill College in Ohio to be
near him, then they both transferred to Northwestern University in
Evanston, Ill.
   ``Blacks and whites didn't get married then,'' she said. ``The
process took five years, trying to work through things with my
family. There was a lot of hullabaloo from his missionary friends
about marrying instead of going to the Congo.''
   Mondlane went to work for the United Nations and didn't return to
Africa until 1961.
   After nine months as a professor at Syracuse University in New
York, Mondlane went to Tanzania, where three Mozambican exile groups
united in 1962 under his leadership and began the guerrilla war.
   After her husband's death, Mrs. Mondlane helped fund schools and
medical posts in the northern provinces that Frelimo controlled
until independence came in 1975.
   ``What I'd like to do is go and work on my farm (in the
countryside) but here I am still working here, doing the same thing
I was doing all my life,'' said Mrs. Mondlane.

<HEAD>Once-Grand Carillon Crumbles As Elderly Tenants Ponder Their Fate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Jose and Juanita Pichardo, Cuban
immigrants in their mid-60s, owning a tiny beachfront room for their
golden years was the payback for 30 years of hard work and modest
living in New York City.
   Hedy Werner wanted a retirement free of mortgage payments and
troubles when she paid nearly $30,000 cash for a room on the 12th
floor of the Carillon Hotel. Now she says her money went to
``gangsters.''
   The dreams of nearly 300 people who say they thought they were
buying security in the form of rooms at the once-grand hotel soured
almost as fast as developer Isaac Gamel sold 72-year subleases on
rooms in 1983.
   Rooms were bought for as little as $20,000 as an investment
believed to be secure through 2055.
   Five years later, the 17-story, 600-room hotel on Miami Beach is
mired in lawsuits, bankruptcies and foreclosures, back under control
of its original property holder, Main Realty, and the tenants face
eviction.
   Main Realty slipped eviction notices under tenants' doors in
November, setting a Jan. 2 deadline. Tenants on Dec. 20 sued all the
principals in the Carillon. In late December the landlord agreed not
to take any action until the case is heard in court, expected
sometime late this year.
   Despite the reprieve, many tenants are worried and confused, and
feel deceived. Many of the elderly residents could lose their
investments, and _ because they are living on fixed incomes _ fear
for their future.
   ``To live here was to live on top of the world,'' Pichardo, 67,
said wistfully as he walked across the hotel's virtually empty pool
deck.
   Juanita Pichardo recalls when the couple used most of their
savings to buy a small room overlooking the pool for $27,000. ``The
hotel was beautiful and everything was working. It had entertainment
at night _ bingo, movies, orchestras on the weekend. Now I realize
it was too good to be true.''
   At the height of what usually is a bustling winter season, only a
handful of residents _ with their own chairs since the hotel removed
nearly all of the chaise lounges _ sit around a sediment-filled
pool. Birds splash the water since the pool was shut down by the
county health department.
   The resort, whose hotel license hasn't been renewed pending
further inquiry by the state, is a haven for crack cocaine addicts;
the rooftop once used as a luxury health spa is littered and reeks
of urine.
   Two full-service outdoor bars are stripped bare, sheets cover
missing chandeliers in the cavernous Art Deco lobby and the
restaurant has long been closed. Residents complain of a faulty
phone system, unreliable elevators, leaky pipes, graffiti and
garbage-strewn stairwells.
   Street people rove the 1957 white-and-aqua-trimmed resort, which
has been cited for multiple code and fire violations.
   ``A lot of older ladies are afraid to come out at night,'' said
Bart Steinman, who rents a room. ``When they bought the place, they
were promised the world. Basically, they're living in an abandoned
building.''
   Jose and Juanita Pichardo, a retired bartender and seamstress,
live on Social Security of $650 a month and some interest income.
Their mortgage payments are $393 a month, plus $224 a month for
maintenance.
   ``It's a very bad situation,'' Mrs. Pichardo said. ``Really, I am
a good fighter. But some days, I just get disgusted.''
   The stressful situation recently landed tenant association
president Lee DuLimba in the hospital with a burst ulcer.
   ``These people come in, abuse the law 100 percent and get away
with it,'' said DuLimba, who has spent the past 2{ years fighting to
improve conditions at the rat-and-roach infested hotel. He says his
life has been threatened, and two bullets from a .44 Magnum were put
through his front door.
   Joseph Ganguzza, the tenants' attorney, says unsophisticated
investors were taken in a murky real estate venture that never was
economically viable. He and tenants also say the city has taken no
serious enforcement action despite the building having been written
up for violations dozens of times.
   ``It's a regular stop,'' said senior license inspector Janice Tye.
   City inspectors acknowledge that even though the hotel's owners
have not been in compliance, they apparently have not paid fines.
   ``The whole problem stems from changes in ownership'' that make
enforcement difficult, said fire inspector Russell White.
   The tenants' $5 million lawsuit seeks an injunction against the
evictions, and damages for fraud, Ganguzza said. Defendants are Main
Realty Inc., which owned the property originally and holds it again;
Carol Management Corp., which leased from them; and Gamel _ who had
purchsed the rights to lease property _ among other individuals and
companies associated with the Carillon.
   Main Realty says tenants face eviction because of hundreds of
thousands of dollars in back rent and maintenance fees. Ganguzza
maintains the tenants have paid all along; where that money went is
part of the dispute.
   The problem is not new to South Florida, but Ganguzza said this
complex case is fairly unusual. ``Of course, elderly people are more
vulnerable to these type of schemes,'' he said.
   Gamel's attorney, Michael A. Hanzman, said his client was
sympathetic to the problems at the Carillon but wasn't to blame.
   ``It appears as though a large majority of the problems ... are
the result of actions that were taken by parties who operated the
hotel after Mr. Gamel sold his interest in the master lease'' in May
1987, though operating control was transferred in mid-1986, Hanzman
said.
   Ed Quinton III, attorney for Main Realty, had no comment on the
suit.
   Meanwhile, rumors swirl and the air hangs heavy at the Carillon
as tenants ponder their futures.
   ``I have no money. I have nobody. No relatives, no friends,
nothing,'' said 76-year-old Ms. Werner, a native of Hungary who
survived the Holocaust and the disappearance of her only child only
to give her money to ``gangsters.''
   Sheldon and Sheila Fiedler of Westchester, N.Y, won't even risk
renting the two rooms they bought after an elderly woman they had
rented to successfully sued them in small claims court over poor
hotel services.
   The economic crimes division of the state attorney's office is
investigating complaints at the Carillon, but could provide no
further details. DuLimba said the state attorney's office indicated
``there was possibly a big case here,'' but he said virtually
nothing has been done to help tenants.
   While some believe the complex case will take a long time to
resolve and that it's unlikely a judge would make an unpopular
decision to go ahead with evictions, others aren't as optimistic.
   ``If I could,'' said Mrs. Pichardo, ``I'd leave in a minute.''

<HEAD>Region to Region, It's Premature to Predict Drought But Not Too Soon
to Worry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Do this winter's mild, dry conditions in many parts of the nation
bode ill for the 1989 growing season? Is the unusual weather causing
problems already? It depends on where the questions are asked, and
of whom. Here are the findings of Associated Press reporters who
surveyed each region.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Corn Belt</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The fear of a second drought looms over pockets of the still
parched Corn Belt, where it's premature to predict another year of
pain, but not too early to worry about whether a mild winter will
bring farmers a harsh spring.
   Though thousands of acres of Midwest farm fields were ravaged by
the drought of '88, much of the eastern Corn Belt _ an area east of
the Mississippi River _ is in moderately good shape because of
abundant rain last fall.
   ``We've come a long way from where we were at the end of the
growing season,'' said Norton Strommen, chief meteorologist for the
U.S. Agriculture Department. ``It will be very important to see what
happens in the next three months filling in holes where it remains
dry.''
   Experts say west-central Illinois, eastern Iowa, northern
Missouri and southern Minnesota have yet to recover from the drought.
   The difference in Corn Belt conditions is reflected in
precipitation since Oct. 1. The western section received 74 percent
of normal precipitation, while the eastern Corn Belt received 119
percent, said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of the Weather
Services Corporation in Massachusetts.
   Even with above average rains, conditions are so dry it'll take
time for the baked earth to return to rich black prairie soil.
Though Iowa had normal moisture since August, it still had only
21.64 inches of precipitation in 1988, the lowest level since 1910,
said state climatologist Harry Hillaker.
   ``It's going to take six to 12 months of normal rain to get
things back to the way it should be,'' he said.
   Dry weather not only affects corn, but another major Midwest crop
_ soybeans, which in 1988 were at their lowest production level
since 1976: 1.54 billion bushels.
   Beyond crops, the unusually warm, snow-scarce winter has
disappointed Wisconsin snowmobilers, postponed some farm equipment
purchases and led some Iowa towns to dig new wells.
   Still, experts say there's no reason to panic _ now.
   ``It's too early to worry about not having a crop,'' said Neil
Harl, an Iowa State University economics professor. ``But it's not
too early to worry about the consequences if you did.''

<NOTE>The Northeast</NOTE>

   It's been a hard winter for Virginia Cochran, owner of a
Richmond, Vt., ski area. Not because of winter weather, but because
of the lack of it.
   ``I thought last year was bad in terms of lack of snow,'' she
said, ``but compared to this year, it was pretty good.''
   Scarcity of snow isn't a worry just to small ski operators.
Officials throughout the Northeast are keeping a nervous eye on
half-filled water reservoirs. Farmers fret about soil moisture.
Businesses selling snowmobiles and snowplows are hurting.
   ``This is disastrous,'' said Steve Kitchen, who has sold half the
usual number of snow tires at his Biddeford, Maine, service station.
   The winter of 1988-89 is likely to be remembered as the Winter of
No Snow.
   ``This has been the driest January in 104 years,'' said Richard
Mamrosh, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Burlington, Vt.
Vermont's Champlain Valley has had 19.9 inches of snow compared to
the normal average of 42 inches.
   The story is the same from Maine as far south as Maryland.
``Generally, we have had below normal snowfall,'' said Frank
Lucadamo, a hydrologist with the weather service's Northeast River
Forecast Center. ``If this continues we could see some problems.''
   Problems are already evident. Officials in Massachusetts, New
York and New Jersey have issued warnings about water supplies.
Reservoirs that supply some big Eastern cities are about 30 percent
below normal levels.
   ``Not only are we well below what we normally are, but there is
no snow upstate and you rely on the melt off of that snowpack in the
spring,'' said Tina Casey, a spokeswoman for the New York City
Department of Environmental Protection.
   The lack of a snowpack has had a wide range of effects. The
Finance Authority of Maine plans to provide $1 million in emergency
loans to struggling shopkeepers who can't find buyers for snow
machines. Farmers in New Hampshire fear the lack of snow cover will
kill off alfalfa fields.
   Buffalo, N.Y.'s city boosters are having problems organizing the
city's annual winter festival. ``We might as well call it
``Summerfest,'' said Robert Carr, a spokesman for the Greater
Buffalo Chamber of Commerce.

<NOTE>The Great Plains</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   As the drought of 1988 becomes the drought of '89, the nation's
breadbasket is worried about producing half a loaf this year.
   Last year's drought hit hard at the Great Plains states, which
produce most of the hard red winter wheat, the primary grain in
bread.
   Lack of moisture this winter in the heartland has agronomists and
statisticians nervous because another below-average crop could
further deplete America's grain reserves and raise food prices.
   Planted in the fall, winter wheat lies dormant until spring, when
it matures and ripens. It is harvested in the summer.
   Farmers in Kansas, the country's No. 1 wheat-growing state, and
Nebraska, Colorado, Montana, and the Dakotas all say they've been
short-changed on moisture since 1980, with last year's drought the
worst on record for many of them.
   In the past few months rain and snowfall have been sparse and
spotty. Eastern Montana and North Dakota are a little better off
than the last two years, Kansas and Nebraska are a little worse.
Colorado is about even. In South Dakota, which lost 68 percent of
its wheat crop last year, the autumn rains didn't come.
   ``At the end of the year we were about seven inches behind in
annual precipitation,'' said Eldon Thiessen, deputy statistician for
the Kansas Agricultural Statistics office. ``The ground was so dry
this fall the wheat never developed a good root system. The soil is
so loose that if the wind starts to blow the crop will be
destroyed.''
   Sumner County, Kan., annually produces more wheat than any other
county in the nation. Last year its farmers harvested 13.8 million
bushels, but county extension agent Gerald LeValley says an
unusually warm winter, lack of snow and rain and the appearance of
bugs in January all have him worried.

   Reggie Wyckoff, the new president of the 60,000-member National
Association of Wheatgrowers, fears his fellow farmers are on the
brink of another season of drought. With a few exceptions,
``everybody is dry,'' said Wyckoff, of Genoa, Colo.
   David Nielsen of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research
station in Akron, Colo., said: ``The wheat doesn't look good but we
could make that up in one or two good snowstorms.''
   Lenis Nelson, a University of Nebraska agronomy professor, says
parts of his state need four to six inches of extra rainfall just to
break even and recharge the subsoil.
   ``You never get quite as much water as you need, so drought is
one of those things that's hard to determine,'' he said. ``But once
you're suffering you know you're in one.''

   Winter storms veering to the north have taken the edge off the
Pacific Northwest's drought, but only at the expense of California
and Nevada, where forecasters fear a third parched year.
   In California, two dry months have dashed hopes raised by heavy
November rains. Statewide, precipitation is 80 percent of normal,
and water runoff into rivers is less than 50 percent of normal, said
Bill Helms, state Water Resources Department spokesman. Reservoirs
are at their lowest since 1977.
   February and March, which usually provide nearly a third of the
year's rain and snow, will need 125 percent of normal precipitation
to make up the shortfall, he said.
   If runoff remains low, water to irrigated farmland may be cut by
up to 40 percent this summer, he said.
   ``The last two years have been critically dry. Last year, we
survived by drawing deeply into our reserves. This year we don't
have the reserves,'' Helms said.
   In San Francisco, where lawns have gone unwatered and fountains
are dry per order of the water department, officials plan to
continue conservation measures instituted last year.
   In northern Nevada, ``things are looking pretty bleak,'' said
state climatologist John James. January precipitation was about 20
percent of normal, he said.
   Last summer, Nevada's drought cut off water to some irrigated
fields, killed fish in overheated streams, and cut into recreation
business around a lowered Lake Tahoe.
   In Utah, a cold and dry January has dimmed hopes that were raised
by a snowy December.
   In Washington, Oregon and Idaho, several northward-tracking
storms off the Pacific Ocean have dumped enough snow to make water
officials breathe easier. But they say below-average snows in
February and March could erase any gains made so far.

<NOTE>The Southwest</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   While other Southwest states have had a warmer, drier winter than
normal, Arizona has had unusual shots of colder air, more rain and
even a mild citrus freeze.
   ``Between Christmas and the middle of January, we had below
normal temperatures and above normal percipitation _ and that's
related to the East Coast being warmer and drier,'' said Craig
Ellis, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Phoenix.
   Phoenix has had almost double its usual rainfall for January _
but that's still just a little more than an inch. Temperatures have
averaged near-normal, but there have been unusual cold snaps because
of a shift in the jet stream across the country.
   The extent of damage from a citrus freeze hasn't been determined,
said Bob Gronowski, a Commission on Agriculture supervisor. ``The
overall problem was not disastrous, but there was damage,'' he said.
   New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana have all had
milder winters.
   Albuquerque had only 5 percent of its normal rainfall in
December, and January was well below normal in most areas of the
state, meteorologist Boyd White said.
   A recent survey of mountain snow-pack depths, however, found
near-normal levels.
   In west Texas, millions of acres of winter wheat are in terrible
shape, drought expert Dan Krieg said, and the lack of moisture poses
problems for the summer growing season as well.
   ``We have no subsoil moisture and so we're going into the crop
season with a severe water deficit. The top six feet are literally
air dry,'' said Krieg, a professor at Texas Tech University.
   The warm, dry winter will spawn a dust problem when spring winds
arrive, Krieg said.
   In Oklahoma City, December temperatures averaged 4 degrees warmer
than usual, and remained above normal for 20 of the first 25 days of
January, meteorologist Bill Bunting said.
   Little Rock has seen temperatures about 2 degrees above normal.
New Orleans' January high temperatures averaged close to 60 degrees
_ 7 degrees above normal, and rainfall measured half the usual level.

<NOTE>The Southeast</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This winter has been unusually warm in the Southeast, prompting
fruit trees to bud early and causing fears of damage if a freeze
comes, but rainfall levels throughout the region generally have been
normal.
   ``Our topsoil moisture levels are in the best shape they've been
in for years,'' said Charles Brantner, a U.S. Department of
Agriculture weather statistician based in Tennessee, a state hit
hard by last year's drought.
   He added, ``Our stock ponds have been replenished by the good
rains we had last fall. ``And things are continuing to look good so
far this year; our pastures are doing well and the winter wheat crop
is thriving.''
   However, the warmer temperatures, averaging between 3 and 8
degrees above normal since the beginning of winter, are beginning to
worry fruit growers in some areas of the Southeast.
   Growers across the region, and especially in Georgia and South
Carolina _ two states that produce much of the nation's peach crop _
are keeping a close eye on their trees.
   ``In Alabama we've already gotten some reports of early blooms,''
said J.T. ``Duffy'' Barr, the USDA weather statistician for that
state. ``The growers are worried that a cold snap will move in and
kill all those early blooms.''
   Ski resort operators in North Carolina say the days there also
have been warmer than usual. But they add that the nights have been
cold enough to allow them to keep their slopes covered with man-made
snow.
   J.B. Kelly, ticketing manager at the Beech Mountain resort near
Boone, N.C., said sales have held up so far despite the warm weather.
   Overall, climatologists and weather watchers say topsoil moisture
levels are in good shape in the Southeast but that they could use
more slow, soaking rains to replenish the subsoil levels. They also
say planting conditions should be good this spring, barring a sudden
change in the weather.

   Towboat operators are uneasy. So are New York stock traders,
German manufacturers and Japanese grain importers whose fortunes
hinge on whether a repeat of the drought will disrupt barge traffic
on the Mississippi River.
   ``Everybody's a little apprehensive,'' said Jim Tuttle, a
hydrologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who is keeping a
wary eye on snowpack and water buildup in the upper Great Plains.
   ``But we're much, much better prepared. If it does happen again,
it will be less traumatic,'' Tuttle said.
   River forecasters say the next six weeks will be critical to
spring river levels. Most worrisome is below-normal snowfall in the
Dakotas, Iowa and other states in the upper Missouri River Valley.
   Things seem OK for now in the Upper Mississippi, Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys, Tuttle said.
   Meanwhile, engineers hoping to head off trouble after record low
water levels last summer are using four dredges to scrape rock
ledges and shoals out of the channel between St. Louis and Cairo,
Ill.
   ``Normally, we wouldn't have any dredges out now. This is the
first time since the 1930s we've had more than three dredges out at
this time. We want to be ready,'' said Clyde Wilkes of the Corps of
Engineers at St. Louis.
   The 2,348-mile long Mississippi is a natural superhighway into
the U.S. heartland, carrying 400 million tons of goods yearly.
   It hauls 57 percent of the nation's grain, 40 percent of its oil
products and 20 percent of its coal, plus fertilizer, cement,
chemicals, auto parts and other bulk.
   The Corps of Engineers keeps a 9-foot deep, 300-foot wide channel
for barges. But the drought closed the river in spots for 96 days
until giant scoops cleared away sediment.
   The worst bottlenecks were in late June at Memphis, Tenn., and
the mouth of the Ohio River, when 130 towboats came to a standstill
for three days. The cargo on their barges could have filled a convoy
of 18-wheelers stretching from New Orleans to Portland, Ore.
   The lowest water levels since records were first kept in 1872
were set in Memphis and two other spots in July.
   Losses for the year were estimated from $65 million to $200
million in a survey by barge operators.
   ``The drought came out faster and more furious than anyone could
have imagined. It was never so low for so long,'' said Jeffrey
Smith, vice president of the American Waterways Operators.
   ``It was a very difficult year that could have been a
catastrophe,'' Smith said. ``This year, we're prepared for the
worst.''

   For Americans jolted by terrorist attacks in
Europe of the Middle East, the only comfort has been that the danger
is far away. Yet in the last six years the FBI has recorded more
than 80 domestic incidents, from bombings to assassinations, and
says dozens of others have been thwarted. Meanwhile, however,
anti-terror laws have been refined, and a secret surveillance court
has been busy. If terrorists are looking for America's
vulnerabilities, authorities say the reverse is increasingly true,
too.

   Traffic droned on the New Jersey Turnpike
just as on any other Tuesday morning. Commuters passed through the
rest area here just as sleepy-eyed. But something was amiss, and if
Robert Cieplensky hadn't spotted it someone might be dead now _ in
New York, perhaps, or Washington or Toronto _ from the shrapnel of a
homemade bomb.
   Cieplensky, a New Jersey state trooper, saw a disheveled young
man in the rest area parking lot, walking in circles, looking under
a car, heading one way, then another. When the man got into a brown
Mazda and pulled out _ narrowly missing parked cars, the trooper
said _ he stopped him.
   The Mazda turned out to contain not just Yu Kikumura, later
identified as a member of the terrorist Japanese Red Army, but also
electrical fusing devices, two clocks, precision tools, U.S. airline
timetables, maps of New York City and other places, a bottle of Ten
High whiskey and 36 $100 bills.
   A search also found three foot-long steel canisters packed with
gunpowder and lead shot.
   Kikumura faces sentencing Monday in Newark following his November
conviction for transporting the bombs ``with the knowledge and
intent that they would be used to kill, injure and intimidate.''
   Though no one knows the bombs' intended target _ sources
speculated it was a meeting of finance ministers in Washington or an
economic summit in Toronto or that pinholes in a New York map marked
the spot _ Kikumura's case and others like it raise a troubling
question:
   Are Americans, who have long felt safe at home, becoming more
vulnerable to terrorists?
   ``The fact that we have been free from terrorist acts to the
extent we have is in some ways amazing,'' said U.S. Attorney George
Terwilliger III, who last year prosecuted three Lebanese natives
stopped just inside the Vermont-Canada border with makeshift bombs.
Federal investigators said they belonged to an organization that
assassinated Lebanon's President-elect Bashir Gemayel.
   ``Are we vulnerable? Absolutely,'' said Frank Bolz Jr., whose
consulting firm trains other nations' police in handling terrorist
incidents.
   ``This is a democratic country, with wide-open borders,'' added
Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp. think tank in
Santa Monica, Calif. ``It's not as though we're protected by a high
wall.''
   Nonetheless, Jenkins said, the United States generally lacks the
driving forces of home-grown terrorism: ideology (usually
``Americans kill in personal quarrels, not for causes'') and ethnic
grievances (the independence movement in Puerto Rico is an
exception).
   As for foreign terrorists, why attack on American soil when there
are convenient U.S. targets abroad, from embassies to fast-food
restaurants? ``It's easier to cross a street than cross an ocean to
commit a terrorist attack,'' as Neil Livingstone, author of several
books on terrorism, put it.
   Still, despite safeguards, bombers have slipped through.
   Even though their numbers have not been great _ the FBI counts
seven domestic terror incidents in the last year _ law enforcement
officials know the potential for destruction and intimidation of
even a single well-placed explosive. (The Vermont bombs blew
2-foot-square steel plates the length of a football field when
agents set them off.)
   Americans' best protection, authorities say, will come from
continued toughening of anti-terror laws and swift justice for those
caught. At least as important is intelligence work.
   In Bolz' words, ``We have to get to know more about the enemy.''
   ``We can't wait for the bomb to go off,'' said the FBI's
counterterrorism chief, Neil Gallagher, who added agents would use
``whatever resources the judicial system would allow ... (to)
neutralize a terrorist act before it occurs.''
   Civil liberties groups are watching for overzealousness,
something the FBI tacitly acknowledged last year in disciplining
agents for an undercover probe of the Committee in Solidarity with
the People of El Salvador.
   The FBI's counterterrorism effort costs tens of millions of
dollars annually, said Gallagher, who declined to be more specific
because the budget is classified.
   ``I always say it's been 95 percent blood, sweat and toil by
those agencies involved, but we've had a bit of good luck, too,''
said Victoria Toensing, a former top terrorism policy official at
the Justice Department.
   She said the tools of anti-terrorism have improved.
   There's better cooperation among investigators and prosecutors _
the FBI, which once balked, she said, now ``has the coffee waiting''
for Justice Department lawyers called to an investigation. And laws
have been toughened _ extradition agreements have been revised, and
it's now a federal crime to attack an American abroad, she noted.
   These changes have not halted terror altogether. In 1986 alone,
the worst recent year for domestic attacks, the FBI recorded 24
incidents and nine preventions.
   In 1987, the FBI's undercover sale of an inert anti-tank rocket
to members of the Chicago-based El Rukns gang led to conspiracy
convictions and long prison terms. The government said they had
offered to blow up U.S. targets for Libya.
   ``A domestic group was willing to commit a terrorist act in the
United States,'' the FBI said, ``in order to receive funding from a
known state sponsor of international terrorism.''
   In Hartford, Conn., members of Los Macheteros, a Puerto Rican
separatist group, are on trial now, charged with conspiracy in a
violent $7 million armed robbery there. And three alleged
revolutionaries accused of plotting a series of robberies and
bombings, including one that injured 22, are being tried in
Massachusetts.
   A 1983 explosion 30 feet from the Senate chamber in the U.S.
Capitol was blamed on a group protesting U.S. foreign policy.
Security was overhauled. Senators were warned to remove identifying
license plates from cars. Seats in the House chamber got bulletproof
backings.
   Before and since, groups have detonated explosives at banks, at
government offices, under police cars _ from anti-Castro
organizations in Miami to affiliates of the Aryan Nations in Idaho.
The tradition of American terrorism goes back to the Weather
Underground, to the 19th century coalminer-terrorist ``Molly
Maguires'' in Pennsylvania, and beyond.
   In recent years, the acts and threats have changed the American
landscape and lowered Americans' resistance to searches. Security
barriers shield the White House and other public buildings, and
airport scanners, having turned up 41,000 guns since 1973, are a
fact of life.
   Not all of the security gates are closed, however, according to
Robert Kupperman of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington: ``If you hit some of the key nodes'' _ gas
transmission lines, water systems or electric power grids _ ``you're
going to have big trouble.''

   In a 1987 mock attack, an Army Special Forces team acting as
terrorists symbolically ``knocked out'' power substations, an
emergency operations center and valves of the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve in Louisiana and Texas. The U.S. Department of Energy said
it was tightening security for the oil stored against an embargo.
   It was no mock attack two years ago when a bomb destroyed an
employee's car at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California, where nuclear weapons are designed. Claiming
responsibility was the Nuclear Liberation Front, a group never heard
of before.
   There is no ``profile'' to use to spot a potential bomber, the
FBI's Gallagher said, citing the case of Raymond Levasseur, on trial
now in Massachusetts with two others on seditious conspiracy charges.
   ``Their group began up in Maine as some husbands and wives who
formed up a leftist terrorist group. ... What identifies them in
advance as terrorists?
   ``Once they began the series of bombings, bank robberies,'' he
said, ``there is a series of trails they left. They kept records
..., they kept safe houses. All that has to be methodically pieced
together.''
   Sometimes the piecing together is beforehand. The decade-old
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court is described as an
important anti-terrorism tool.
   The court, which convenes in a secret room in the Justice
Department headquarters with judges rotated every two weeks, hears
500 applications a year for electronic surveillance in foreign
intelligence, spying and terrorism cases.
   ``We have never been turned down,'' said Mary Lawton of the
department's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review.
   It was a FISA court-approved wiretap that alerted FBI agents to a
dynamite bomb aboard a Los Angeles-to-Boston flight in 1982. Three
men convicted of conspiracy and transporation of explosives
appealed, saying their rights had been violated, but the convictions
were upheld.
   Kikumura's lawyer, Ronald Kuby, is challenging the legality of
the search that turned up the bombs in New Jersey, saying the
government violated his client's rights ``in pursuit of this
allegedly higher goal of attacking terrorism.''
   Speaking generally, Kuby added: ``When a supposed democracy
violates individual civil rights and goes outside the law in order
to punish certain individuals, that society loses the moral
authority to criticize and condemn the actions of others.'' Such
inequity leads to more violence, he said.
   Some see an inequity in punishing actions, even violent ones,
taken for a political cause. Last year, the Greek government
declined to extradite a suspected terrorist bomber to Italy,
explaining that he had been acting in the Palestinian ``struggle for
... independence.''
   A current case raises the issue again.
   In 1982, a bomb went off on a Pan Am 747 approaching Honolulu
with 285 passengers aboard. A 16-year-old boy died. A Palestinian
indicted in the case, Mohammed Rashid, is being held in a Greek jail
for a passport violation, and the U.S. government wants him
extradited for trial here. A decision is pending in Athens.
   Ideology is irrelevant when a bomb goes off, said Bolz, the
security consultant. ``People can be killed ... no matter what the
cause.''

   Here are excerpts from a recent Associated
Press interview with Neil Gallagher, who heads the counterterrorism
section of the Federal Bureau of Investigation:
   AP: An alleged member of the Japanese Red Army was arrested in
New Jersey with three bombs last year. Isn't it unusual for overseas
terrorists to operate here?
   Gallagher: Whether or not that's an aberration, I think it drives
home the message that, though the United States has not had the
degree of incidents that we've seen worldwide, certainly the
potential is always there for a terrorist incident in the United
States. As long as the causes exist that any given terrorist group
may follow, it can happen in the United States.
   Q: That case boiled down to one alert state trooper.
   A: One state trooper taking outstanding law enforcement action on
a given day with a traffic stop. Faced with that type of law
enforcement scrutiny a terrorist organization would be less apt to
take an act here. ... The second factor that would tend to minimize
the number of terrorist activities in the United States is the fact
that there is a counterterrorism program. ...
   The term `terrorist' tends to glamorize what otherwise is a
criminal element. Any criminal organization, they're going to have
associates, they're going to have planning, they're going to take
overt acts. ... Certainly, to bring weapons in or to bring
explosives into the United States may be a problem; so, they may
have to reach out to some element in the United States to once again
bring together enough resources to commit a terrorist act. And in
essence what you're doing is putting the pieces of a puzzle
together. ...
   If there is information received that they are affiliated with a
Middle East or, perhaps, any other nationally associated terrorist
group, we receive information regarding that, there's the first
piece of the puzzle. ... They may assume that they're subject to
U.S. government surveillance.
   Q: If the Mideast terrorist Abu Nidal landed at Kennedy Airport
he could assume _
   A: I'd probably be there to shake his hand. I'd love to meet him
_ especially here in the United States. ... If you look at the
history of the Abu Nidal organization and the violence and
suddenness of their attacks at the Vienna and Rome airports _ if we
... were to receive information about their arrival in the United
States, that would receive intense interest in the FBI.
   Q: `Intense interest'?
   A: We can't wait for the bomb to go off or for other criminal
action to be taken. If we have information which would allow us to
neutralize a terrorist act before it occurs, then certainly we'll
take it. ...
   Whether it's surveillance, whether it's developing of sources,
... (or) working with the Customs Service of any other federal
agency or with the State Department, to turn down visa applications
if we know a person is dangerous enough. Because it's nice to watch
on TV, when someone's able to get just one car-length away from an
individual and follow them for an hour show. Surveillance in real
life is not as simple. ...
   Q: In a bomb case in Connecticut, the animal-rights activist
charged reportedly had no knowledge of bomb-making, and
investigators were quoted as saying `terrorists' may have helped
her. Is there a terrorist infrastructure?
   A: There's not a `terrorist underground,' per se, in the United
States. Are there support networks for foreign-based intelligence
groups? Yes. Is there a criminal element to which someone who needed
to have a bomb or needed to purchase weapons could go? Obviously
there is.
   Q: What about civil liberties considerations? FBI officials were
disciplined over the investigation of the Committee in Support of
the People of El Salvador.
   A: We have to be extremely careful not to concern ourselves with
people who just may be saying things which are contrary to the
safety or security of American society. Take, for example, ... the
young lady up in Connecticut that was apprehended with a bomb. ...
   There are many people who are truly concerned about animal
rights. And the FBI has no interest in these type of people.
However, when someone takes a bomb and attempts to destroy either
property or a life in behest of that cause, we would become involved
because then it becomes terrorism.''

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said six task
forces have been created in major cities to combat ``crime in the
suites'' by fighting against securities and commodities fraud.
   The attorney general, flanked by U.S. attorneys from New York,
Chicago and Kansas City, announced the creation Tuesday of six
securities and commodities fraud units in those cities as well as in
Los Angeles, Denver, and San Francisco.
   The announcement came just weeks after disclosure that federal
investigators in Chicago had conducted a two-year undercover
operation that turned up widespread evidence of fraud by commodities
futures traders at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago

   President Bush creates an ethics commission.
Attorney General Dick Thornbugh promises tougher securities fraud
enforcement. The Harvard Business School adds a required course in
ethics.
   As tales of fraud in Chicago's commodities pits and the largest
securities fraud scandal ever ring out a decade marked by sleaze in
government and business, ethics is being touted as an antidote to
immorality.
   ``A subject like ethics is always important but becomes
particularly deserving of emphasis at a time when you seem to have a
strong streak of greed running through people's emotions,'' said
Boris Yavitz, a professor of public policy and business
responsibility at Columbia University's business school.
   In one of his first acts, Bush appointed a panel to recommend
ethics reform in government. The move indicates Bush wants to erase
the legacy of the Reagan administration, in which 100 officials were
accused of unethical behavior.
   Thornburgh _ who replaced Edwin Meese III, himself accused of
widespread unethical acts _ said Tuesday the government will create
special task forces and hire more investigators targeting securities
and commodities fraud.
   ``They want to get credibility back in the financial markets and
they're going to enforce all the rules and regulations to give the
markets back to the public,'' said Jack Barbanel, a futures analyst
with Gruntal &amp; Co.
   At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of
Trade, a two-year federal inquiry has raised allegations that as
many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out
of millions of dollars.
   In New York, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. recently agreed to plead
guilty to six felonies and pay a record $650 million in the
largest-ever securities fraud probe.Michael Milken, whose pioneering
work in high-yield bonds thrust Drexel to the forefront of the
securities industry, is expected to be indicted soon.
   Financial and government officials predict the latest moral and
legal transgressions will trigger reforms such as stiffer jail terms
and fines for white-collar lawbreakers.
   Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are up
for federal reauthorization this year, and Congress is expected to
be under pressure to give the agencies greater police power.
   Some changes may be apparent already. For example, the Drexel
fine was 6{ times larger than any previous securities fraud
settlement.
   And on Jan. 19, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined one trader
a record $625,000 and his wife _ also a trader _ $125,000 for
prearranging deals. Both were expelled.
   In an attempt to reassure viewers that its brokers are ethical,
investment giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. is airing television
commercials that conclude with the message ``A Tradition of Trust.''
   Most Wall Street brokerage houses now require new employees to
sign agreements saying they understand company policies on the
handling of sensitive or confidential information.
   Since reports of endemic insider trading surfaced in 1986 and led
to the conviction of speculator Ivan Boesky, brokerage firms have
moved to frequently emphasize guidelines. Newly hired college
graduates are indoctrinated about behavior deemed immoral or illegal.
   ``We've updated computer surveillance of transactions to provide
faster and more accurate warning signs of trading and brokerage
actions within the firm,'' said Peter Roche, a spokesman for Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., where a 24-year-old junior analyst last year was
prosecuted for insider trading.
   The North American Securities Administrators Association, which
represents state securities regulators, wants to require that
brokerage firms tell new clients whether a stockbroker has committed
any violations.
   ``That would turn up the heat considerably in terms of people in
the industry knowing that information about them wasn't just going
to stay in some file or computer chip in Washington but is there on
the table in front of the customer,'' NASAA spokesman Scott Stapf
said.
   Business schools such as Harvard's, which instituted an ethics
class last fall after receiving a $20 million endowment from former
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad, are teaching
students that every business decision has social repercussions.
   ``Schools are responding to it because businesspeople are
pressuring them to,'' said David Vogel, a professor at the
University of California at Berkeley's School of Business
Administration. ``The private sector cares very much about this.''
   IBM Chairman John F. Akers, writing in the current issue of a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management
publication, said ethical instruction is fine _ but should begin in
kindergarten.
   ``If an MBA candidate doesn't know the difference between honesty
and crime, between lying and telling the truth, then business
school, in all probability, will not produce a born-again convert,''
Akers said.

<TEXT>
   Most business leaders responding to a new survey
said foreign investment in the United States helps the economy,
creates jobs and increases U.S. productive capacity.
   But one in five nonetheless said the current acceleration in
foreign investment threatens U.S. social and cultural foundations.
   The nationwide survey, taken last fall and released Tuesday by
the accounting and management consulting firm Touche Ross &amp; Co.,
elicited responses from 519 executives, 30 percent of whom are chief
executives.
   Business leaders tend to support foreign investment more than the
general public does, according to a recent survey by the Japan
Society, a U.S.-Japanese friendship organization that surveyed
attitudes toward Japanese investment of people in California,
Tennessee and Michigan.
   Touche Ross cited government statistics that said foreign
investment in the United States has surpassed $1.5 trillion.
   That figures includes $1.3 trillion in portfolio investments such
as government securities, bank deposits and corporate stock and $262
billion in direct investment in manufacturing plants, banks and real
estate.
   Foreign direct investment alone has more than tripled since 1980,
the firm said.
   The executives were asked to describe the effect of foreign
investment on the U.S. economy and were given three options.
   The survey said 55 percent said it helps the U.S. economy, 31
percent said it creates little cause for alarm and 14 percent said
it severely threatens the economy.
   Among those who felt it threatens the economy, those most
concerned were from the Mountain region, while respondents from the
Southeast were much less likely than the overall average to express
that opinion, the survey said.
   Twenty-six percent of those responding from the aerospace-defense
industry and 21 percent from the retailing business, both higher
than average levels, described foreign investment as a severe threat
to the economy.
   Touche Ross said that suggests those participating in the survey
from the areospace-defense industries are ``understandably more
concerned about the effect on national security than is the average
respondent.''
   It said the higher-than-average response from retailers indicate
they may feel ``threatened by the recent barrage of direct foreign
acquisitions of U.S. retail operations.'' Last year, the
Canadian-based Campeau Corp.'s $6.6 billion buyout of Federated
Department Stores Inc. was one of 1988's biggest deals.
   But despite the bullish view that respondents overall took toward
foreign investment's effect on the U.S. economy, the survey said ``a
significant number express concern about the effect it has in other
areas.''
   It said 21 percent of those responding said they felt the
acceleration of foreign investment threatens U.S. social and
cultural foundations.
   Among some other key findings in the Touche Ross survey of
corporate leaders' attitudes:
   _Eighty-two percent of the respondents do not want broad
protectionist legislation and 82 percent do not think such
legislation will become law.
   _Political stability was cited most frequently as the main reason
for the accelerating rate of foreign investment, while favorable
exchange rates were cited second.
   _Eighty-six percent of those responding agree that foreign direct
investment has created jobs for U.S. citizens, and one-third said it
had prevented high rates of unemployment during the past five years.
   _More than two-thirds said foreign direct investment has
increased the nation's productive capacity over the past five years.
More than 80 percent said foreign ownership has either no effect on
or improves relations with the labor force.
   _Respondents ranked the auto industry as both the industry most
helped and the industry most hurt by foreign investment. Ranked
second among the most helped industries was real estate and second
among those most hurt was insurance.

<HEAD>Board of Trade Plans Seminar On Federal Racekteering Statute</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Scandals-Ethics Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade is planning a seminar
for its members to explain racketeering charges that could be
leveled as a result of the government's investigation of alleged
commodities trading fraud.
   Former U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb will lead the seminar on the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, or
RICO, Karsten Mahlmann, BOT Chairman, said Tuesday.
   Webb, who preceded the current U.S. attorney in Chicago, Anton
Valukas, also will prepare a legal document for the BOT's board of
directors on the parameters of the RICO statute, Mahlmann said.
   The sweeping law, originally designed to wipe out organized crime
by taking the profit out of mob activity, has been applied to a
variety of cases involving white-collar crime and fraud.
   ``We have requested Mr. Webb to develop this legal memorandum and
seminar for our membership in order to clarify misunderstandings
surrounding this statute,'' Mahlmann said.
   He did not give a specific date but said Webb's seminar would
take place in about two weeks.
   No charges have been announced, but attorneys for subpoenaed
traders say the statute could be used prosecuting those targeted in
the FBI sting operation at the Board of Trade and the rival Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   The federal government is reportedly investigating allegations
that traders and others systematically cheated investors out of
millions of dollars through illegal trading practices.
   Valukas and FBI officials have declined to comment on the
investigation.
   Mahlmann told BOT members at a special meeting Tuesday the
exchange may reconsider dual trading and explore electronic trading,
two issues that have been hotly debated in light of the
investigation, according to sources who attended the meeting.
   Dual trading, the time-honored right of futures traders to both
trade for their own accounts and fill customer orders, is seen by
critics as an open door to abuse of the traditional open-outcry
style of commodities trading.
   Electronic trading would use computers to match buy and sell
orders, bypassing the 140-year-old ``open-outcry'' system in which
traders crowd into recessed ``pits'' to execute trades through a
combination of yelling and hand signals.
   The meeting was the first membership meeting to be called since
the disclosure of the probe Jan. 19.
   The Board of Trade, with about 3,400 members, is the world's
largest futures exchange. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange ranks
second.
   Federal authorities have issued more than 200 subpoenas to
traders, firms and officials of the Board of Trade and the Chicago
Merc, seeking information about suspected fraudulent trading at the
two exchanges.
   The Board of Trade issued a statement saying only that it had
presented to its membership a series of proposals that may be part
of a package of recommendations to be sent to the exchange's board
of directors on Feb. 7.
   But sources who attended the meeting said Mahlmann specifically
mentioned dual trading as one of the trading practices that will be
examined by a task force drawn from the board of directors.
   ``And he said the Board of Trade would be remiss if they did not
look at electronic trading,'' said a trader who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``I think they're just waking up to reality and smelling the
coffee,'' the trader said. ``Sooner or later we're going to have
electronic trading.''
   The Chicago Merc, which hopes to launch its Globex electronic
trading system this summer, announced last week it had formed a
special panel to review its rules and trading practices.

<TEXT>
   After 16 months of fruitless negotiations, the
contract dispute between Eastern Airlines and its machinists appears
to be heading toward a 30-day deadline and a possible walkout by
Eastern's largest union.
   On Tuesday, the financially hurting airline rejected binding
arbitration nearly as soon as the offer was made by the National
Mediation Board.
   Under the federal board's rule, rejection of binding arbitration
by either side leads to a 30-day ``cooling-off period.'' Talks
continue with mediators, but if no settlement is reached, the union
can strike and the company can impose the conditions of its last
contract offer.
   The mediation board was expected to formally declare an impasse
and start the 30-day clock today.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said the deadline pressure could
lead to a settlement, but union leader Charles E. Bryan said the
company wants a walkout.
   ``They've been spoiling for a strike,'' said Bryan, president of
District 100 of the International Association of Machinists. ``We
don't want a strike, but it looks (like) we're going to have to
accommodate them.''
   Bakes said in a statement he was guardedly optimistic a
settlement could be reached under deadline pressure.
   ``A firm deadline is a very real and urgent incentive for both
the company and the union to work out differences,'' he said.
   Company officials said they did not expect a major drop-off in
advance bookings because of a potential strike.
   Tom Matthews, Eastern senior vice president for human resources
and chief negotiator, wrote to the mediation board _ which entered
the talks one year ago _ after receiving a Jan. 31 notice that both
sides were being offered arbitration. Matthews turned down the offer.
   Matthews wrote, ``In a very real sense, the stakes for Eastern
are so fundamental, so very directly tied to whether Eastern can
survive, that the company cannot in such a situation allow a third
party (or an arbitration board) to make those decisions.''
   Bryan has long contended that Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent
company, wants to break Eastern's unions and sell its assets.
   ``They think they have a good chance of breaking the strike. But
they've got alternatives and they don't really seem to care. The
attitude is if they destroy the company, so what?'' Bryan said.
   The union leader said Tuesday the two sides met in secret talks
directed by mediation board chairman Walter C. Wallace for five days
starting Jan. 18 in Savannah, Ga., but made little progress.
   The company, which was seeking $150 million in wage concessions
from the union, estimates it's losing $1 million a day.
   The machinists, representing mechanics, baggage handlers and
other ground service workers, or more than one-fourth of Eastern's

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. has intensified its battle
against hostile suitor Shamrock Holdings Inc. with the filing of a
suit charging that Shamrock broke federal securities laws when it
solicited proxies from Polaroid shareholders.
   Polaroid's suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Boston,
came one day after Shamrock sued the instant photography pioneer to
block a proposed $1.1 billion stock buyback.
   Polaroid charged that Shamrock and other participants in the
hostile bid illegally sought proxy votes because they failed to
formally notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of their
plans, Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips said.
   Polaroid's suit also charged that Shamrock, a television and
radio concern owned by the Roy E. Disney family, made false and
misleading statements in soliciting shareholder proxies.
   Shamrock's $45-a-share offer for Polaroid _ which Polaroid's
board has rejected as inadequate _ values the Cambridge-based
company at $3.2 billion.
   On Monday, Polaroid announced its stock buyback proposal and said
it was also planning to issue $300 million in convertible preferred
stock to an investor group, Corporate Partners L.P.
   Analysts said the plans were a defensive move against the
Burbank, Calif.-based Shamrock, which responded by suing Polaroid in
Delaware State Court. Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware.
   Shamrock charged in a statement that Polaroid's directors
``breached their fiduciary duties by issuing additional, dilutive
voting securities to persons friendly to management in the face of
Shamrock's announced intention to wage a proxy contest at Polaroid's
upcoming annual meeting.''
   Shamrock's suit asked the court to bar the proposed buyback and
stock issue.
   However, Polaroid said the sale of the preferred stock to
Corporate Partners had already been completed. In an affidavit,
Polaroid attorney Melvin L. Bedrick said stock certificates were
delivered Monday to Corporate Partners, the transaction was recorded
and payment was made to Polaroid.
   Late Tuesday, Judge Carolyn Berger of the Delaware Court of
Chancery deferred Shamrock's request that she stop Polaroid from
selling stock to Corporate Partners. She gave Shamrock time to
determine whether outstanding conditions remained that would mean
the deal between Polaroid and Corporate Partners was not actually
completed.
   The judge also denied Shamrock's request that Polaroid be
required to give five days' notice regarding repurchase of its
common stock.
   Shamrock spokesman Michael Sitrick said the company was studying
the ruling and did not have any comment.
   The two sides are already battling in the Delaware courts over
Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan. Shamrock is appealing a
decision that upheld the plan.
   If the plan is invalidated, Shamrock says it will boost its offer
to $3.36 billion, or $47 per share.
   Shamrock has indicated it will wage a proxy fight for control of
Polaroid's board at the company's annual meeting in May and, if
successful, would force the sale of Polaroid either under its offer
or any higher third-party bid.
   Polaroid closed Tuesday at $41.62{, up $1 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.

<HEAD>State Asks To Bar Drexel From Casino Business Pending License Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The involvement of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. in the Wall Street insider trading scandal is costing the firm,
at least temporarily, its lucrative business with New Jersey's
casino industry.
   Officials asked the state Casino Control Commission to suspend
the investment firm pending a decision on Drexel's application for a
license to do business with the Atlantic City casinos, Anthony J.
Parrillo, director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement,
said Tuesday.
   State law prohibits people or companies facing criminal charges
from doing business with the casinos, Parrillo said.
   Because of the huge volume of business Drexel conducts with New
Jersey's heavily-regulated gambling industry, the state asked Drexel
in 1987 to apply for a license and undergo the required scrutiny.
   Drexel has earned fees totaling more than $120 million by
marketing securities valued at more than $3 billion for Atlantic
City casinos in recent years, said Parrillo. The firm itself says it
has raised more than $2.5 billion in permanent capital for the
industry.
   Drexel agreed Dec. 21 to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a
record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the sweeping
securities fraud case brought against it by the U.S. Justice
Department.
   The six charges were filed last week. Most of them concern
Drexel's relationship with Ivan F. Boesky, the former takeover
speculator who turned state's evidence in late 1986 after admitting
to extensive insider stock trading.
   ``While criminal charges are outstanding and the (state's
licensing) investigation continues, any doubt with respect to
licensees should be resolved'' before Drexel is allowed to continue
dealing with the casinos, Parrillo said.
   The gaming division is the investigative arm of the state
attorney general's office that deals with the casino industry.
   Drexel _ the nation's fifth-largest investment firm _ issued a
statement Tuesday expressing confidence the matter would be resolved
soon.
   ``Based on steps Drexel is taking and new procedures we will be
instituting both at our own initiative and in coordination with
various regulatory agencies, we believe that we will be able to
qualify for licensure shortly,'' Drexel stated.
   Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder said he could not detail those
steps or how they could resolve the pending criminal charges, but he
said the firm believed those matters could be addressed.
   Parrillo said the Casino Control Commission had set no hearing
date to consider the suspension or to resolve Drexel's bid for a
license.
   Drexel has been involved with more than half of New Jersey's
casinos since the state legalized gambling in Atlantic City a decade
ago, Parrillo said.
   According to the state's 26-page complaint, Drexel has given
financial advice and raised capital for the holding companies of
such casinos as Caesars Atlantic City, the Golden Nugget and Del
Webb's Claridge Casino Hotel.
   Drexel also has been retained by the company belonging to
entertainer Merv Griffin in its acquisition of Resorts International
Inc.
   One of the six charges filed last week against Drexel involve
Golden Nugget Inc., a former Atlantic City casino owner. Drexel
allegedly committed mail fraud to manipulate MCA Inc. common stock
during Golden Nugget's sale of its MCA holdings.
   Golden Nugget sold its casino to Bally Manufacturing Corp. in
March 1987.
   Though Drexel was the first, the state has since asked three
other investment companies that do business with the casinos to
apply for licenses, Parrillo said. They are Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc.,
Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. and Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Those applications are pending before the Casino Control
Commission, Parrillo said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now its just Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani.
   Today is the first day of the former U.S. attorney's new career
as an ordinary citizen.
   On Tuesday, Giuliani said he planned to spend ``an extra hour
playing with my son,'' Andrew, 3, followed by breakfast with a
prospective employer.
   Giuliani kept busy right up to the end of his last day in office
by attending a Washington news conference, but only after Justice
Department officials vouched for him with wary security guards.
   Neither Giuliani nor his interim successor as Manhattan's U.S.
attorney, Benito Romano, had their credentials with them when they
showed up at the Justice Department.
   The New York prosecutors had to wait for other government
officials to come downstairs and identify them for security guards,
said a chuckling Giuliani, often called the best known prosecutor in
the country.
   The Washington press session, was called by Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh to announce the formation of white-collar crime
task forces at U.S. attorney offices around the country.
   ``This is exactly what we need and what we've needed for some
time,'' said Giuliani, who suggested the idea about a
year-and-a-half ago.
   The Southern District of New York, which Giuliani has headed
since 1983, will gain six attorneys assigned full-time to the task
force.
   Outside the news conference, Giuliani who made headlines
nationwide with his vigorous prosecution on Wall Street crooks, New
York mobsters and political grafters, drew a crowd of reporters,
eager to learn more about his future plans.
   As he has done for months, Giuliani _ often mentioned as a
possible Republican mayoral candidate _ spoke much but gave away
little.
   Asked whether he had problems with the demands of the politics _
the glad-handing and parades, Giuliani said with a grin: ``I love
parades. I don't know about all the rest of politics but I love
parades.''
   ``It seems to me a better idea that given the point that I was
at, to put all these things off until the day that I'm a private
citizen,'' he said. ``I can feel a lot more comfortable about it
starting tomorrow. And I'll be glad to tell you, starting tomorrow,
the factors that are involved in deciding what I'm going to do.''
   But when a reporter asked, ``How can we reach you, where will you
be tomorrow?'' all he said was, ``Pounding the pavement.''

   Midday volume totaled 483.4 million shares,compared with 530.5

   Market watchers said it was a healthy sign that the market
retreated from its peaks earlier in the week because the market
can't advance convincingly without a period of rest and
consolidation.

<HEAD>Atari Files $250 Million Antitrust Suit Against Nintendo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atari Corp. has filed a $250 million
lawsuit against Nintendo Co. Ltd., accusing the Japanese video game
giant of monopolizing the market with restrictions on its licensed
game creators.
   The antitrust suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, alleges
that Nintendo forbids its developers from selling adaptations of
their games to other video game companies.
   ``Developers are faced with the choice between selling games only
to Nintendo customers or not selling,'' according to Atari's
complaint.
   That restriction causes the creators of video games ``to yield to
coercion from Nintendo, so that Atari and other manufacturers of
video game consoles are unable to obtain many popular games for use
on their own systems,'' the suit claims.
   The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Atari is seeking to end Nintendo's
alleged practice of prohibiting game developers from writing video
games for anyone else, said Joshua Tropper, Atari's general counsel.
   The suit, which also names as a defendant Nintendo's U.S.
subsidiary, Nintendo of America Inc., is the latest development in a
long dispute between Nintendo and American makers and distributors
of video games over the $2.3 billion annual market.
   In December, Atari Games of Milpitas, Calif., which is not
related to Atari Corp., filed a $100 million suit against Nintendo,
accusing the company of unfair competition.
   Early last month, Nintendo sued Atari Games, accusing the company
of making and selling unauthorized video-game cartridges.

<HEAD>Wiring Checks Ordered For British Boeing Airplanes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Civil Aviation Authority said Wednesday that
124 Boeing airplanes in Britain must undergo the same detailed
safety inspections ordered for similar airplanes in the United
States.
   The British order, like that issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration, affects all Boeing aircraft built since Dec. 31,
1980.
   British Airways has the most Boeing aircraft in the country, 61,
but the order also affects 12 smaller domestic and international
airlines, said a CAA spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with
British custom.
   The American agency told U.S. airlines Tuesday to inspect all
their 741 newer Boeing 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s after problems were
discovered in 17 aircraft.
   The order requires the airlines to inspect the planes' engines
and cargo compartment fire detection, warning and extinguishing
systems for crossed wiring or plumbing.
   ``In cases like this the FAA always pass on the directive to us
and we pass it on to the airlines,'' said the CAA spokesman.
   The new order follows earlier FAA and CAA directives ordering
inspections of specific systems in certain types of aircraft
following the Jan. 8 crash of a British Midland Boeing 737 in
central England that killed 46 people.
   That plane landed with its left engine on fire and its right
engine shut down. The cause of the crash is still under
investigation.
   Airlines have 25 days to complete the inspections in Britain and
the United States.

<HEAD>Chrysler To Market Hyundais In U.S. Beginning In 1991</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's biggest
automaker, will sell 30,000 autos a year in the United States
through Chrysler Corp. beginning in l991, a Hyundai spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Hyundai will sell, through Chrysler's Eagle Division, a 4-door
sedan with a 2,400-cubic centimeter engine that will be assembled at
its newly opened plant in Bromont, Quebec.
   Hyundai has not decided yet whether the model will be the Sonata,
currently on sale in the United States, or a completely new model.
   Hyundai's Canadian plant, the first Korean auto assembly plant
outside Korea, has been producing Sonatas since Jan. 13 and will
produce about 30,000 Sonatas this year.
   The capacity will increase to 100,000 units by l991. Some 50,000
autos will be sold in the United States directly by Hyundai Motor
America and 20,000 units will be sold in Canada.
   With the alliance between Hyundai and Chrysler, all three major
South Korean automakers will be teamed up with the Big Three U.S.
automakers. Daewoo Motor is 50 percent owned by General Motors Corp.
and Kia Motors is 10 percent owned by Ford Motor Co.
   GM's Pontiac Division now markets Daewoo's LeMans in the United
States, and Ford sells Kia's Festiva.
   Chrysler owns 21.6 percent of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp.,
which in turn owns 7.5 percent of Hyundai.
   The No. 3 U.S. automaker's Eagle division already sells the
Premier sedan designed by France's Regie Nationale des Usines
Renault and built in Canada, and the Summit subcompact built by
Mitsubishi in Japan.
   The Hyundai spokesman said he hoped the cooperation with Chrysler
would enhance Hyundai's presence in North America. Hyundai
successfully entered the North American market with its
subcompact-type Excels, but is trying to move upward with the
compact-type Sonatas.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge rose a healthy 0.6 percent in December after having fallen
during the previous month, the Commerce Department said today.
   The December jump in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
which is designed to predict economic activity six to nine months in
the future, followed a 0.2 percent decrease in November and a 0.5
percent rise in October.
   The index has alternated between dips and gains for the past nine
months, which many economists believe is a signal the economy is
headed for a slowdown in growth that would help keep inflation in
check.
   ``It tells you that there is not a boom building,'' said Samuel
D. Kahan, chief economist for Kleinwort Benson Government Securities
Inc. in Chicago. ``It suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the
next couple of quarters, but it most assuredly does not point to any
kind of a recession.''
   The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowest
quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the
October-December period, when the increase in the gross national
product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent.
   Although President Bush plans to adopt his predecessor's forecast
that the economy will grow at a 3.2 percent rate in 1989, many
private economists believe the Reagan administration's predictions
for growth, interest rates and inflation were too optimistic.
   Six of the nine available components of the economic index
contributed to December's increase, while two detracted from it.
   The biggest boost came from an increase in manufacturers' orders
for consumer goods. Other business barometers that contributed to
the increase were: rising stock prices, more orders for new plants
and equipment, rising prices for raw materials signaling a strong
demand, increased demand for business permits and growth in the
inflation-adjusted money supply.
   The indictors that made a negative contribution were a shortening
in the length of the average work week and an increase in weekly
unemployment claims.
   One indicator, the time needed for companies to receive
deliveries from vendors, was unchanged.
   December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967
base of 100. That was up 2 percent from the same month a year
earlier.
   In another economic report released today, the Commerce
Department said construction spending shot up 2.5 percent in
December, ending a year in which building activity registered its
weakest showing since the recession year of 1982.
   Kahan said construction activity rebounded somewhat toward the
end of the year after interest rate increases early in 1988.
   An easing of economic strength without the threat of recession
would be a welcome development for many economists who believe
slower growth is needed to keep the economy from overheating and
causing a flare-up in inflation.
   Economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said in advance of today's report that the jagged performance
of the leading index indicates ``growth is certainly going to slow,
but it doesn't seem to be predicting any recession at this point.''
   ``The fact that it's see-sawing says that the real risk of the
economy overheating ... isn't really there anymore,'' she said. ``On
the other hand, there's no downturn that extends across the
economy.''
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, said before
the report was released that if inflation stays under control, ``I
don't see anything else on the horizon that would terminate the
recovery.''
   ``There is some evidence of slowdown in the economy but not very
much,'' Evans said. ``It's the so-called soft landing approach,
which appears to be working effectively.''
   The Federal Reserve Board since March has been pushing up
interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic
growth.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a congressional committee
Tuesday that he believed the central bank's efforts to boost
interest rates would help prolong the recovery.
   ``As we enter 1989, there are few signs of any significant
impediments to continued expansion,'' he said.
   The traditional precursor to an economic downturn has been three
consecutive declines in the leading index. But while the index has
correctly predicted all eight recessions since its creation in 1948,
it also falsely forecast four additional recessions.
   The Commerce Department said that, starting with the report for
January, it would drop two indicators from the composite index and
add two others in an attempt to make it more accurately reflect
future economic trends.

<TEXT>
   Binney &amp; Smith Inc., known for its Crayola
brand crayons, has entered into a licensing and royalty agreement
with Magic Marker Industries Inc. to make and sell products under
the Magic Marker name and trademark, according to the two companies.
   The financial terms of the agreement and its duration were not
disclosed.
   Magic Marker, based in Trenton, N.J., has been operating under
protection of Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws since April 1986.
   Binney &amp; Smith, which makes drawing products as well as crayons,
will begin selling products under the Magic Marker name on April 1,
the company said. The product line includes permanent markers,
pocket pens and highlighters for adults and water-based markers and
coloring pens for children.
   Brad Drexler, a Binney &amp; Smith spokesman, said the Magic Marker
products will be made by an outside manufacturer. The identity of
the manufacturer was not disclosed.
   The licensing agreement is part of Binney &amp; Smith's strategy to
expand its coloring and drawing product line, said Richard S. Gurin,
president and chief executive officer.
   `'Our preliminary market research has shown a positive awareness
among consumers for the Magic Marker name,'' Gurin said, ``and this
licensing venture will afford us an opportunity to evaluate the
future potential of the equity in the Magic Marker name.''
   Cindy Constantini, a spokeswoman for Magic Marker, said the
licensing and royalty agreement will allow the company to complete
its reorganization plan.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a wave of selling that
puzzled some analysts in light of the strong gains of the previous
session.
   ``It's surprising that we're not getting much follow-through,''
said Jerry Gidel, a grain-market analyst in Chicago with the G.H.
Miller division of British-owned LIT America Inc.
   He said much of the selling appeared to be caused by speculators
collecting profits amassed during the recent advance.
   The slow pace of export sales also weighed on grain and soybean
futures, although China was said to have purchased 750,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at market prices.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 3 cents lower with the

   Stock of textbook publisher Houghton Mifflin Co.
extended its rise today after surging in the previous session
following the disclosure that a group led by Texan Robert M. Bass
boosted its stake to 5.6 percent.
   The Bass Group said Tuesday in disclosing its holdings that its
latest purchase was for investment purposes. Houghton Mifflin
pointed out that Bass had been an investor in the company for some
time and said it found nothing unusual about the filing.
   But Wall Streeters remembered that it was the Bass Group's bid
last May that started another publishing giant, Macmillan Inc., on
the path to a takeover at a price about 80 percent higher than its
stock had been trading.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading today, Houghton Mifflin rose
another $1.50 a share to $46.75 after Tuesday's advance of $8.87{ a
share. At today's midmorning price, the company's 14 million shares
are valued at about $650 million.
   The Bass disclosure follows two years of sweeping changes in the
publishing business that has seen Macmillan fall to British
publisher Robert Maxwell, Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc. yield to
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Grolier Inc. sell to Hachette SA of
France.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., another publishing giant,
underwent a costly recapitalization in 1987 to avoid being acquired
by Maxwell.
   Alan Kassan, who follows publishing companies for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said Bass demonstrated his interest in the publishing
business with his initial Macmillan bid and his earlier acquisition
of Bell &amp; Howell Co., an information services and publishing concern
based near Chicago.
   ``I don't know what his intentions are, but he has the interest
and the deep pockets to acquire the whole thing if he so chose,''
Kassan said.
   Bert Boksen, who follows media companies for Raymond James &amp;
Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., said Houghton Mifflin could
command a price in the mid-$50 a share range should a buyout effort
be made.
   A woman answering the telephone at Bass's offices in Fort Worth,
Texas, said it was company policy not to comment on its business
plans.
   Boston-based Houghton Mifflin is a leading educational publisher
and also publishes general interest books and educational and
word-processing software.
   It ranked fourth in the nation behind Harcourt, Gulf &amp; Western's
Simon &amp; Schuster and Macmillan based on 1987 educational revenue,
according to the trade newsletter Educational Marketer, published by
Knowledge Industry Publications Inc. in White Plains, N.Y.
   Shearson's Kassan said Houghton Mifflin has been a well-run
company with ``a fair earnings performance'' over the past two years.
   Hougton Mifflin earned $24.1 million, or $1.70 a share, on
revenue of $368.3 million in 1988.
   Nonetheless, Kassan said the company is vulnerable to a takeover
because it has a relatively small amount of its stock in the hands
of company insiders and is ``clearly a leader'' in the growing
lementary school reading market.
   In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Bass Group said it purchased 161,200 shares of Houghton Mifflin
stock between Jan. 10 and Jan. 27 at a prices ranging from $34.21 to
$36.80 a share.
   It said the purchase leaves it with 790,200 common shares of
Houghton Mifflin, or 5.6 percent of its 14 million shares.
   In its statement, Houghton Mifflin said, ``We do not see anything
unusual in the Bass Group's filing. Houghton Mifflin has other large
stockholders, most of whom have been investors for a long time.''
   Paul D. Weaver, secretary for the company, declined comment when
asked if the company's board had met to discuss the matter.
   The company adopted a poison-pill takeover defense plan in
December.
   Last May, the Bass Group proposed to acquire Macmillan for $64 a
share at a time when the company's stock had been trading at about
$50 a share. Maxwell acquired Macmillan last fall at a price of
$90.25 a share, or about $2.5 billion.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Fall On Profit-Taking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices opened moderately lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid profit-taking and new
selling linked to an increase in delivery intentions.
   Corn futures also declined in early trading but wheat was higher,
boosted by the Agriculture Department's decision to target Iraq for
sales of 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   The drop in soybean values followed a strong rally late Tuesday
afternoon and partly reflected a weakening of bullish enthusiasm due
to an increase in the number of notices of intent to deliver
soybeans against the March contract.
   Soybean delivery notices totaled 9.2 million bushels early today,
compared with 4.4 million bushels on Tuesday, the first day for
traders to post such notices.
   Corn and wheat delivery notices also increased markedly today but
wheat remained firm on indications of increased export business. In
addition to the USDA's offer to Iraq, the agency has targeted China
for additional sales of 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.37\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
lower to { cent higher with March at $2.71 a bushel; oats were }

   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .23 cent lower with April at 77.82
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher
with March at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to
.38 cent higher with April at 44.10 cents a pound; frozen pork

<HEAD>Compaq Achieves Another Milestone: $2 Billion In Revenue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. said Wednesday it recorded an 88 percent
profit increase in the last quarter of 1988, capping a year in which
the personal computer maker became the first start-up company to
achieve $2 billion in revenue in as little as six years.
   Just one year earlier, Houston-based Compaq attained $1 billion
in revenue faster than any company built from scratch. It previously
ascended to the ranks of the Fortune 500 in record time.
   ``Strong worldwide sales of our entire product line contributed
both to the year's and to the quarter's strong performance,'' Rod
Canion, the president and chief executive, said in a statement.
   International sales, excluding Canada, contributed 39 percent of
Compaq's yearly revenue, the company said.
   Compaq, founded early in 1982, grew up as a maker of personal
computers compatible with International Business Machines Corp.'s
line. It reached adulthood in 1987 when IBM switched to its Personal
System-2 line and Compaq chose to stick with the old standard.
   A front-page headline in a recent issue of Info World, a trade
publication, said, ``Compaq Vying To Become the IBM of the '90s.''
   That is somewhat of an overstatement: IBM remains nearly 30 times
the size of Compaq, and its revenue growth alone last year was twice
Compaq's overall revenue.
   Still, at least in the field of personal computers Compaq is
trying to portray itself as the preserver of industry standards, a
role once held by IBM. But IBM remains a formidable rival.
   Compaq's latest challenge is that IBM's new PC line is slowly but
surely expanding its share of the market, while the extension to the
old IBM standard promoted by Compaq and other IBM rivals is still on
the drawing boards.
   Canion and his partners began designing their first personal
computer in February 1982. Sales began in 1983. When the year was
completed they had tallied sales of $111.2 million, an American
business record.
   Compaq reached the Fortune 500 in 1985 and achieved its first
billion-dollar year in 1987.
   Compaq said its earnings in the quarter rose to $91.9 million, or
$2.18 a share, from $49 million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue jumped 55 percent to $668 million from $432 million a year
earlier.
   For all of 1988, Compaq said its earnings rose 87 percent to $255
million from $136 million a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to
$6.30 from $3.59, or to $6.27 from $3.57 on a fully diluted basis;
that is, assuming conversion into common stock of all convertible
securities. Revenue rose 69 percent to $2.07 billion from $1.22
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>MCI Earnings Rise Five-Fold In Latest Quarter, Capping `Best Year'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. completed ``the best year in MCI's
history'' with a five-fold jump in earnings and a 38 percent revenue
increase in the last three months of 1988, the long-distance company
said Wednesday.
   Washington-based MCI said it achieved the strong results through
a combination of cost controls, new service offerings, a good sales
and service organization and the increasing sophistication of its
computerized network.
   MCI spent $6 billion over eight years to build its long-distance
network, and the huge investment is beginning to pay off by
attracting customers, said Daniel Akerson, the chief financial
officer.
   ``We think it was a great quarter and an unbelievable year,''
Akerson said in an interview.
   MCI, invading the big-business strongholds of market leader
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., said it won contracts over the
past year with Chrysler Corp., Cray Research Inc., Procter &amp; Gamble,
the Social Security Administration, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and others.
   Reflecting the importance of big-business accounts, 1 percent of
MCI's and AT&amp;T's customers account for roughly half of their volume
of business, Akerson estimated.
   In contrast to MCI, the No.3 long-distance company, US Sprint
Communications Co., has continued to lose money. But US Sprint has
trimmed its losses lately and is continuing to increase its volume
of business.
   AT&amp;T makes steady profits from long-distance, but it recorded the
first annual loss in its history last year because of a one-time
charge to cover the expense of speeding up its conversion to a
digital network to meet the competition from MCI and US Sprint.
   MCI said it earned $122 million, or 46 cents a share, compared to
$23 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$1.43 billion from $1.04 billion.
   For all of 1988, MCI said its earnings shot up to $346 million,
or $1.23 a share, from $64 million, or 22 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue jumped 69 percent to $5.14 billion from $3.94
billion.
   Charges for early repayment of debt reduced the latest quarter's
earnings by $10 million and the year-earlier quarter's earnings by
$14 million, MCI said. Offsetting those charges, the company
recorded pre-tax gains of $12 million in the latest quarter and $19
million in the year-earlier quarter from previously negotiated
antitrust settlements.

<HEAD>Further Delays Expected in Malaysian Car Exports to United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans to sell a Malaysian-built car
in the United States have bogged down due to problems with a U.S.
distributor and delays stemming from required regulatory
modifications to the vehicle.
   Through its government-backed Perusahan Otomobil National Ltd.
(PROTON), Malaysia already has begun exporting locally made cars to
Britain.
   The first 600 Proton Sagas left Tuesday for Britain, and Proton
Cars United Kingdom Ltd. expects to sell 6,000 in the first nine
months after the vehicle's March 16 introduction, the firm's
managing director, Peter King, said at a sendoff ceremony at Port
Klang, near Kuala Lumpur.
   Malaysia already has sold a few thousand Proton Sagas in Sri
Lanka, Malta, Ireland, New Zealand and Bangladesh and originally
hoped to begin U.S. exports last year.
   But modifications needed to meet U.S. standards caused a
postponement and further delays are likely while problems involving
a U.S. distributor are worked out, industry sources said.
   Jamil Mohamad Jan, chairman of Proton, said Tuesday the company
might seek arbitration or sue its U.S. distributor, Proton America
Inc., alleging breach of contract.
   Last week, Yugo America Inc., its Global Motors Inc. and its
Proton America affiliate filed for protection from creditors under
U.S. bankruptcy law.
   Proton terminated its distributorship agreement with PAI recently
because the distributor had failed to obtain necessary federal and
state approvals for importing the Saga into the United States by
Nov. 18, 1988, the national news agency Bernama reported.
   Under a November 1987 agreement, PAI was to have imported a
minimum of 30,000 cars in the first year, and Malaysian Proton
officials hoped shipments eventually would rise to 100,000 a year.
   Asked if another company would be appointed distributor for the
car in the United States, Jamil replied that Proton first would have
to settle its legal matters with PAI.
   The regulatory modifications also present an obstacle. Jamil said
it took Proton 17 months to modify the Proton Saga to meet British
regulations.
   Proton officials had estimated it would cost Proton $10 million
to modify plant facilities to make cars that would meet American
specifications and another $20 million for advertising.
   The Proton Saga engine and gearbox are made by Japan's
Mitsubishi, but most of its other parts are made in Malaysia.
   The car comes in 1.3- and 1.5-liter engine versions and retails
in Malaysia for $9,159 to $11,723, depending on equipment.
   The car has been a pet project of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and the company has been operating at a loss. But Jamil said Proton
was expected to report a profit of between $2.56 million and $2.93
million for the year ending March 31, 1989.
   The plant was established at a cost of more than $120 million,
and first year sales in 1985 amounted to 7,494 cars, 11 percent of
all passenger cars sold in Malaysia.
   Last year, 42,500 Proton Sagas were sold here, accounting for 73
percent of the Malaysian market.
   Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghafar Baba said Tuesday that because
of increasing demand, annual production would be increased in
October to 110,000 cars from the current 56,000.

   The state prosecutor's office opened a criminal
inquiry Wednesday into an insider trading scandal involving
businessmen with close ties to France's Socialist government.
   The decision came one day after France's stock exchange watchdog
agency, the Commission des Operations de Bourse, said it found
evidence of illegal insider trading in shares of the U.S. company
Triangle Industries Inc. just before its takeover by the French
state-owned metals manufacturer Pechiney SA.
   The commission said it could not identify who leaked valuable
information before the deal was announced, and recommended a
criminal investigation.
   Edith Boizette, an investigating magistrate attached to the
Tribunal of Paris, was named to lead the probe.
   The commission said Tuesday it found ``serious, precise and
concordant'' indications of illegal activity in the trading of
Triangle shares during the few days after Pechiney had agreed to an
offer of $56 per share, but before the deal was announced on Nov. 21.
   Among the investors who bought Triangle stock at around $10 a
share, and made quick profits within a week when the price soared,
was Max Theret, a businessman with longstanding ties to the
Socialist Party.
   Theret's investment company made purchases that were suspicious,
the commission said.
   Also named in the report was Roger-Patrice Pelat, one of
President Francois Mitterrand's oldest and closest friends.
   Pelat, his wife and two sons bought 10,000 shares of Triangle
stock on Nov. 16 for the equivalent of about $100,000, and resold it
in three installments on Nov. 22, 23 and 28, making about $450,000.
   In another development Wednesday, the commission said it opened
an investigation into suspected trading irregularities in the shares
of the French bank Societe Generale.
   The investigation will cover trading since June 1, 1988, and will
try to establish if there was insider trading or if there was an
attempt to manipulate the stock price of the bank.
   Formerly state-owned, Societe Generale was sold to private
investors in 1987 under the privatization program of the
conservative government then in power. The Socialists contend that
friends of then-Premier Jacques Chirac were handed control of the
bank.
   The Socialist government, in office since last May, has denied
opposition charges that it was behind a takeover attempt on Societe
Generale in a covert bid to reestablish state control of the bank.
   Last month, the government was embarrassed when Industry Minister
Roger Fauroux, one of the non-Socialist members of Cabinet, was
quoted as saying the Societe Generale affair was ``much more
serious'' than the Pechiney-Triangle case and that the stock
exchange commission should have investigated it.
   Even so, Commission Chairman Jean Ferge said as recently as
Tuesday that no decision to open an inquiry had been made.

<HEAD>Former Parent Company of Bailed-Out Thrift Converts Bankruptcy Filing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial Corp. of America said Wednesday it
plans to convert its federal bankruptcy filing from a Chapter 11
reorganization to a Chapter 7 liquidation.
   David A. Gill, Financial Corp.'s bankruptcy trustee, said
reorganization of the company as a going concern was not feasible,
repeating statements previously made by Financial Corp. officials
and others.
   Company officials earlier warned stockholders that they would
lose their entire investments.
   Under Chapter 7, a company's assets are liquidated and
distributed to satisfy creditors in order of priority. Creditors
often receive some compensation under a liquidation, while
stockholders often lose out.
   The Chapter 11 filing involved an attempted reorganization while
the company continued operating. Under a reorganization, investors'
claims often are reduced or replaced with different claims.
   Financial Corp., former holding company for American Savings &amp;
Loan Association, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Sept. 9, when the Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Insurance Corp. seized American, then the nation's largest insolvent
thrift.
   Without American, there was little left of Irvine-based Financial
Corp.
   American was turned over to the Robert M. Bass Group of Fort
Worth, Texas, in exchange for an injection of $350 million. The
government promised to provide up to $1.7 billion.
   Under Bass ownership, the new American Savings is being operated
as a much smaller, solvent S&amp;L with assets of about $15 billion.
   The government assumed responsibility for the thrift's huge
portfolio of bad loans and real estate, which gradually will be
sold. American management is overseeing that liquidation through a
``bad bank'' or ``liquidating bank'' called New West Federal Savings
&amp; Loan, with assets valued on paper at about $22 billion.

   Stock prices showed a small loss in active
trading today as traders cashed in some of the market's strong
January gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.93 to 2,338.39
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 686 up, 758 down and 511
unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were doing some spotty selling in the
belief that the market was due for a pause or period of retrenchment
after the 173.75-point rise in the Dow last month.
   That marked one of the most dramatic gains for January in recent
years, surpassed only by a 262.09-point jump at the start of 1987.
   Analysts also noted caution over recent evidence of continued
strength in the economy.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the index of
leading economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in December, outpacing
many advance estimates.
   On Friday, monthly statistics from the Labor Department are
expected to show a good-sized gain in payroll employment for January.
   Compaq Computer climbed 2] to 72[. The company reported
fourth-quarter earnings of $2.18 a share, against $1.25 in the like
period a year earlier.
   West Point-Pepperell gained 2[ to 52~. Farley Inc. increased it
offer for the company from $48 a share to $52 a share.
   Circle K, which said it retained a merchant banking firm to study
ways to increase the return to its shareholders, rose 2] to 14~.
   MCI Communications added { to 25| as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. MCI posted substantially higher
fourth-quarter operating earnings.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .27 to 166.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market

   W.R. Grace &amp; Co. said Wednesday its
fourth-quarter net income rose 51 percent, helped by strong
performances in all four of its business segments.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, the New York-based
holding company said its after-tax profit totaled $75.5 million, or
88 cents a share, up from $50.1 million, or 59 cents a share in the
1987 quarter. Revenue rose 26.6 percent to $1.65 billion from $1.3
billion.
   For all of 1988, the W.R. Grace said its net income rose 35
percent to $233.6 million, or $2.75 a share, from $173.1 million, or
$2.03 a share. Revenue for 1988 rose 28 percent to $5.79 billion
from $4.52 billion.
   ``There's no question that all of Grace's business lines are on
solid footing and growing steadily,'' said J. Peter Grace, chief
executive.
   The company's businesses include chemicals, energy, health care
and specialty businesses, such as cocoa processing and software
distribution.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures led a selloff Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade's grain and soybean markets, reversing some
of the strong gains tallied in the previous session due to supply
concerns.
   The decline in the wheat market was triggered in part by an
Agriculture Department adjustment that effectively moved the USDA
average cash price for wheat 6 cents closer to $4.23 a bushel, a
level that would free farmers to sell on the open market wheat they
have been storing as part of the government price-support program.
   ``There was quite a bit of selling on the assumption that once
the trigger level is reached, there will be a major sell-off,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, grain market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. in New York.
   ``But today's slump, of course, means we are moving further away
from it,'' she said.
   Analysts cited profit-taking as a reason for steep losses in the
soybean market, where heavy selling late in the session erased more
than half of Tuesday's advance.
   At the close, wheat was 5} cents to 7{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.31{ a bushel; corn was \ cent

<HEAD>Better Times Ahead, Chairman Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   USX Chairman David M. Roderick Wednesday
predicted that profits during the last year of his leadership will
surpass the healthy returns posted in 1988 by the streamlined oil
and steel company.
   ``We just feel extremely confident that 1989 will be a better
profit year,'' Roderick said at his last quarterly news conference
before his mandatory rtirement May 31 at age 65. ``That's usually a
prediction that I avoid making. So obviously I have a very high
level of confidence.''
   Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and steel, coupled with
greater sales volume and lower operating costs companywide will
enable USX to surpass the 1988 profits it announced Tuesday, he said.
   The company had 1988 net income of $756 million, or $2.62 per
share, more than triple the $219 million, or 54 cents per share,
reported for 1987. Sales rose from $14.9 billion to $16.9 billion.
   The 1988 performance was led by a turnaround in steel operations,
which posted operating profits of $501 million, compared with $125
million in 1987.
   Roderick said he disagrees with predictions of a slump in steel
late this year.
   ``Everybody's anticipating a slowdown in the second half. They've
been saying that for five consecutive years. They've been wrong five
consecutive years,'' he said.
   The chairman also is more optimistic about steel industry
shipments than even the company's official prediction of 76 million
tons.
   ``My own opinion is it's going to be closer to 77 or 78'' million
tons because of continued strength in capital spending, the Gross
National Product and employment, he said.
   U.S. steel exports should double from about 500,000 tons last
year to a million tons in 1989, Roderick said.
   In energy operations, the company's Marathon Oil Co. subsidiary
should benefit from higher crude oil prices, lower exploration costs
and the renewal of business in Libya. Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. unit
should enjoy higher natural gas prices and greater sales volume, he
said.
   As it did in 1988, the company will end 1989 with $1 billion or
more in excess cash, he said.
   If President Bush fails to keep a campaign promise to renew steel
import quotas, unfair foreign competition could upset expectations,
Roderick said.
   ``If anybody has any illusions that these foreign countries
(don't) continue to subsidize, forget it. They're doing it on a
massive scale,'' he said. ``In South America, if they weren't
subsidized, they's all go belly up.''
   He said the European Common Market recently permitted the Italian
government to grant $6 billion in subsidies to that nation's steel
industry.
   Steel shipments by USX will increase from 12.2 million tons in
1988 to 13 million tons or more this year, he said.
   The gains are expected even though 1988 operating profits were
only around $45 per ton when Roderick had predicted $60 per ton.
   He blamed the collapse of demand for tubular steel used in oil
and gas exploration, an unintended rise in steelmaking costs,
equipment problems, and accounting errors. Most of those problems
will disappear in 1989, Roderick said.
   USX President Charles Corry, elected this week to succeed
Roderick on June 1, said one of the biggest challenges facing him
concerns the ability of the company's smaller, leaner steel
operation to weather a recession.
   ``We haven't tested ourselves in the new configuration yet in a
down cycle,'' Corry said after the news conference. ``I haven't made
up my mind yet whether the steel industry can lose the kind of money
it lost in 1982 and '83'' without companies failing.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Profit Down 8.8 Percent In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. on Wednesday posted an 8.8
percent decline in its fourth quarter earnings, due partly to a
one-time charge for costs in the implementation of its joint
newspaper operating agreement in Detroit.
   The media company said that in the three months ended Dec. 31 it
had a profit of $45.6 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with
$50 million, or 83 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Total operating revenue rose to $574.6 million in the quarter
from $527.1 million in fourth quarter 1987.
   Knight-Ridder set aside $13 million for anticipated severance and
other costs related to the joint operating agreement between its
Detroit Free Press and Gannett Co. Inc.'s Detroit News. Opponents of
the partial merger asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to delay
the deal.
   Annual earnings rose to $156.4 million, or $2.76 a share,
compared with $155.2 million, or $2.65 a share, in 1987. Operating
revenue rose to $2.08 billion from $1.97 billion the previous year.
   Robert F. Singleton, Knight-Ridder's chief financial officer,
said unfavorable factors affecting annual results included a decline
in newspaper advertising lineage that affected the entire industry,
an average 13 percent rise in newsprint costs and declining
profitability at its Miami Herald.
   Knight-Ridder's newspaper division, with 30 daily newspapers,
showed an operating profit of $299.73 million, down 8.1 percent from
$326.19 million in 1987.

   Energy futures prices rose in moderate trading
Wednesday, buoyed by technical factors and growing investor
confidence in OPEC, market watchers said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
48 cents higher at $17.51 a barrel after falling 26 cents in the
previous session. Other contract months also rose.
   Among refined products, the March contract for unleaded gasoline
rose 1.34 cents to close the day at 49.63 cents a gallon, while
domestic heating oil increased 1.04 cents to 50.44 cents a gallon.
Other contract months also advanced.
   Analysts said that after a weak start prices rose despite the
lack of new news to spur prices.
   ``There was no real fundamental change in the market,'' said
Richard Redoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``The
market is going through a consolidation phase.''
   The American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil supplies
was neutral to bearish for prices, traders said. The report,
released after the close of trading on Tuesday, showed crude stocks
were down slightly while gasoline supplies rose and heating oil was
mostly unchanged.
   Analysts said prices got some strength from continued investor
confidence that OPEC will follow through on its pledge to lower
production.
   The agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, which took effect Jan. 1 and extends for six months, set
a quota of 18.5 million barrels a day, more than 3 million barrels a
day less than the cartel was producing late last year.
   Crude oil prices have risen more than $3 a barrel since the new
quota was announced last November. Prices had fallen sharply during
most of 1988.
   ``There was nothing fundamentally new today other than growing
confidence that OPEC is serious about what it wanted to do,'' said
Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

<HEAD>Treasury Schedules $28.75 Billion Borrowing Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department announced Wednesday it
plans to borrow $28.75 billion next week to replenish the
government's coffers in a giant debt auction which will feature a
sale of 30-year bonds for the first time since last May.
   Every three months, the government holds three debt sales to
finance the $2.7 trillion national debt. The auction, known as a
quarterly refunding, features the sale of three-year notes, 10-year
notes and 30-year bonds.
   The government, however, was prevented from offering any 30-year
bonds at the last two quarterly auctions because of a failure by
Congress to raise the ceiling on issuance of long-term debt.
   Congress finally passed new legislation before it adjourned late
last year and William Bremner, Treasury deputy assistant secretary
for finance, said the 30-year bonds would be a part of next week's
auction.
   At a briefing for reporters, Bremner said Treasury still expected
to have enough total borrowing authority to finance the national
debt at least until next summer.
   Many in Congress expect the government to bump up against the
current $2.8 trillion debt limit sometime in August, but Bremner
refused to be specific about the month.
   ``All things being equal, we expect to make it through without
difficulty until the summer,'' he said.
   The battle over increasing the debt limit is expected by many in
Congress to be a major showdown with the new administration over
budget priorities since without legislation to boost the borrowing
authority, the government would face the prospect of missing such
necessary payments as the monthly Social Security benefits.
   The auctions for next week call for:
   _$9.75 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be auctioned Tuesday.
   _$9.5 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of $1,000
to be auctioned on Wednesday.
   _$9.5 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of $1,000
to be auctioned on Thursday.

   The battle for textile giant West Point-Pepperell
Inc. heated up Wednesday as Farley Inc. sweetened its hostile tender
offer to $1.53 billion.
   Farley, based in Chicago, said it would pay $52 per share in cash
for Pepperell stock, up from its initial $48-per-share, or $1.4
billion, offer on Oct. 24. The bid, which had been set to expire at
midnight Wednesday, also was extended until midnight Feb. 15.
   A Pepperell spokesman said the company would have no comment on
the latest offer. ``We have not yet received this proposal and the
board of directors will consider it in due course,'' he said.
   On Wall Street, meanwhile, trading in Pepperell stock was active.
It closed at $53.25 a share Wednesday, up $2.50.
   Pepperell, the nation's largest publicly traded textile company,
manufactures such products as Martex sheets and towels and Gold Toe
socks.
   Farley, one of the nation's largest privately owned
conglomerates, controls Fruit of the Loom Inc., the nation's biggest
underwear manufacturer, and Acme Boot Co. Inc., whose brands include
Acme and Dingo boots.
   In a statement from its Chicago headquarters, Farley said the
increased bid ``once again demonstrates our resolve to acquire West
Point-Pepperell.''
   The offer is conditional on receiving, or owning outright,
two-thirds of the outstanding shares. The conglomerate already
controls 2.9 million shares and has received offers for another 15.7
million, which together account for about of 62 percent of Pepperell
stock.
   The move is the latest in a series of events that began last
Friday, when Pepperell _ which has consistently fought Farley _ said
it was talking with third parties who might be interested in
purchasing the West Point, Ga.-based company.
   In a filing with the Security and Exchange Commission, Pepperell
said it was not for sale, but ``has entered into preliminary
negotiations with various third parties who have expressed an
interest in a transaction involving the company.''
   Pepperell also suggested it might undertake a recapitalization,
which analysts believe would leave the company in the hands of
current management.
   Patricia Ryan, an analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla., said Farley's announcement Wednesday likely was a
direct response to Pepperell's search for a ``white knight.''
   Pepperell has claimed from the beginning that Farley's offer was
an attempt to purchase the company before its stock could reflect
last year's acquisition of the bulk of competitor J.P. Stevens &amp; Co.
Inc., giving Pepperell about a quarter of the nation's home fashion
textile market.
   Ms. Ryan and other analysts estimated Pepperell's stock is worth
in the $55 range.
   Analysts long have expected a higher offer in the Pepperell deal,
which also has been caught up in court and legislative battles since
its inception.
   Pepperell's board voted in November to resist Farley's overture.
It went to the extent of holding a football-style pep rally at a
high school stadium in Lanett, Ala., where Chairman Joseph L. Lanier
Jr. told a cheering crowd, ``Our determination is to whip Farley. We
are going to fight Farley until hell freezes over, and then we are
going to fight him on the ice.''
   After Farley won a U.S. District Court ruling that some of
Pepperell's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defenses were not allowed
by state law, a state legislator introduced a bill in Georgia's
General Assembly that would speed up the effective date of laws
allowing the provisions.
   The bill won approval in the Georgia's House and currently is
awaiting action in the Senate, where a committee has recommended
approval.
   Pepperell has appealed the District Court ruling to the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, where a decision is pending.
   Also pending is a ruling from U.S. District Judge G. Ernest
Tidwell on Farley's claim that the state's anti-takeover law is
unconstitutional.
   Farley's offer includes conditions that Pepperell's anti-takeover
defenses be voided.

<HEAD>Mediation Board Issues Letter To Start Countdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Mediation Board notified money-losing
Eastern Airlines and its militant Machinists union Wednesday that a
30-day clock is about to start ticking on their stalled contract
talks.
   Meanwhile, there were signs that some air travelers were
rethinking their flight plans with a potential strike looming.
   Eastern Airlines formally rejected binding arbitration Wednesday
to resolve the 16-month impasse, but the union was willing to
submit, board Chairman Walter Wallace announced in a news release
from Washington.
   ``There can be no change in rates of pay, rules or working
conditions or established practices in effect prior to the time the
dispute arose, nor does the union have the right to strike during
this 30-day period,'' said Wallace.
   The 30-day cooling-off period begins Thursday and expires at
midnight March 3.
   Both sides say salaries are the major remaining issue. Eastern is
asking the 8,500-member Machinists union to take $150 million in pay
cuts, but the union wants $50 million in raises.
   Federal mediator Robert Cerjan said every effort would be made to
resolve the dispute during round-the-clock sessions.
   Meanwhile, some travelers were showing signs they are concerned
about a possible disruption in air service by the Miami-based
carrier. Eastern was taken over three years ago by Texas Air Corp.,
which also owns non-union Continental Airlines.
   Flying through Miami on his way home to Burlington, Vt., from
vacation in Paraguay, Eli Harvey said a strike ``would be a major
problem. We're already having problems in Boston with them wanting
to raise the tariffs and slow down the smaller traffic to Boston
from Burlington, so if Eastern goes on strike that could be a real
problem for us.''
   Andrew Geller, a transportation analyst with Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia, said Eastern's latest moves could have
negative repercussions for the airline.
   ``People that have scheduled flights for 30 days from now will at
least to some degree change their flight plans,'' he said. ``The
traveling public goes, `Why take the chance?' ''
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said in a statement Tuesday that he
is ``guardedly optimistic'' a settlement can be reached under
deadline pressure.
   The National Mediation Board claims a 98 percent success rate at
avoiding strikes once negotiations reach this stage, but talk of an
Eastern strike already has raised discussion of sympathy strikes by
other carriers.
   Eastern Machinists chief Charles Bryan, who has long charged
Texas Air is trying to bust Eastern's unions and break up the
carrier, believes Eastern workers can gain strike support from other
airline workers.
   ``We have international strengths throughout the world, anywhere
Continental or Eastern airlines expects to get any help or any
involvement, including transferring of luggage or servicing their
aircraft by any unionized air carrier throughout the world, they're
going to be stopped,'' he said.
   Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first three
quarters of 1988 and has lost more than $1 billion in the past
decade.
   Eastern is awaiting completion of a $365 million sale of its
Northeast shuttle service to New York developer Donald Trump and has
said it must sell other assets to stay afloat unless it can reduce
labor costs.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plunge As Chilean Refinery Strike Is Averted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices tumbled Wednesday following news that a
labor agreement had averted a strike at a large, state-owned Chilean
copper refinery.
   On other markets, precious metals rebounded, grains and soybeans
fell; energy futures rose; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper settled 1.05 cents to 6.60 cents lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in March at
$1.363 a pound.
   The sell-off was triggered mainly by reports that workers at
Chile's Empresa Nacional de Mineria smelter-refinery had reached a
settlement with the government, eliminating prospects for a strike
on Friday.
   The facility refines 200,000 metric tons of copper per year, or
about 15 percent of the total production in the world's leading
copper-producing country.
   ``That's a lot of copper,'' said Craig Sloane, a metals-market
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``If that
refinery wasn't operational it would be a significant factor in the
market.''
   Chile's copper production already has been crippled by the Jan.
13 shutdown of smelting operations at Codelco's Chuquicamata mine,
the world's largest copper mine.
   The smelter was shut down after an explosion and is not expected
to resume operations for another month.
   Mechanical and labor problems in Chile, Peru and some of Africa's
major copper-producing nation's have contributed to recent strong
gains in the copper market. The spot price of copper on the
Commodity Exchange reached a record $1.6475 a pound on Dec. 8.
   Gold and silver futures prices advanced moderately on the
Commodity Exchange after four days of sharp losses that had sent
prices to their lowest levels since last October.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $2.10 higher with February at $393.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.5 cents to 4.4 cents higher with February
at $5.835 a troy ounce.
   Wheat futures led a sell-off on the Chicago Board of Trade's
grain and soybean markets, reversing some of the strong gains
tallied in the previous session and highlighting supply concerns.
   The decline in the wheat market was triggered in part by an
Agriculture Department adjustment that effectively moved the USDA
average cash price for wheat 6 cents closer to $4.23 a bushel, a
level that would free farmers to sell on the open market wheat they
have been storing as part of the government price-support program.
   Traders sold wheat contracts in anticipation of a major sell-off
if the $4.23 level is reached and new supplies come onto the market.
   Analysts cited profit-taking as a reason for steep losses in the
soybean market, where heavy selling late in the session erased more
than half of Tuesday's advance.
   Wheat settled 6 cents to 8} cents lower with March at $4.31} a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 2} cents lower with March at $2.73{ a
bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5 cents lower with March at $2.17 a
bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 9{ cents lower with March at $7.67{
a bushel.
   Energy futures prices rose in moderate trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, buoyed by technical factors and growing
investor confidence in OPEC.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .48 cent to .59 cent
higher with March at $17.51 a barrel; heating oil was 1.04 cents to
1.27 cents higher with March at 50.44 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.34 cents to 1.74 cents higher with March at 49.63
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
with support stemming from fears of weight losses and deaths from
bitterly cold weather in the Great Plains, and selling linked to
profit-taking after a recent run-up in prices.
   Hog futures prices rose on fears that cold weather in the Midwest
would slow the movement of hogs to market, while pork-belly futures
fell on scattered profit-taking.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .35 cent higher with
February at 75.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .28
cent higher with March at 84.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .12
cent to .50 cent higher with February at 43.62 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .30 cent lower to .93 cent higher with February at
39.45 cents a pound.

   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. announced Wednesday
that it is negotiating with several major insurance companies to
sell its JCPenney Casualty Insurance Co.
   JCPenney Casualty markets auto, homeowners and other insurance
through centers in company stores and direct-response mail campaigns
in 21 states.
   The division is based in Westerville, a suburb of Columbus.
   Joseph J. DeMelio, vice president and director of insurance for

casualty business because it did not combine well with family
apparel and home furnishings in stores.
   ``While we did see encouraging results for our insurance
products, the synergy that we envisioned ... did not materialize,''
DeMelio said in a written announcement.
   DeMelio said the company would continue to honor its insurance
commitments during the negotiations. J.C. Penney Co. will continue
to operate the JCPenney Life Insurance Co., which offers life,
health and credit insurance through direct response.
   Tillinghast and Co., an insurance industry consulting firm, has
been hired to assist J.C. Penney Co. in the negotiations.

   The dollar finished higher against most major
currencies Wednesday in a late surge of buying.
   Gold prices ended higher in New York after declining overseas.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid price for gold of
$391.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $390.80 late Tuesday.
   The U.S. currency started the day by advancing in the Far East,
but later turned mixed in nervous European trading as the markets
awaited results of Friday's meeting of finance ministers and central
bankers from the seven major industrialized nations.
   In late afternoon trading in New York, the dollar suddenly shot
up, finishing at its highs for the day.
   ``Some dollar demand came out of the blue,'' said Robert Hatcher,
vice president of foreign exchange at the New York office of
Barclays Bank PLC of Britain.
   Analysts said they weren't certain what inspired the last-minute
dollar buying. Some, like Hatcher, suggested that it could have
reflected Japanese investors' interest in the U.S. Treasury
Department's upcoming quarterly refunding. The auctions of Treasury
bonds, used to help finance the federal debt, often spur foreign
investors to buy dollars in advance to pay for the U.S. securities.
   Whatever the reason, the dollar's late surge had a snowball
effect and brought more buyers into the market, traders said.
   ``Probably a little bit of panic set in,'' suggested Michael
Dallow, a currency analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Dealers said they expect the dollar to trade in a narrow range
ahead of Friday's meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven and
the release that day of U.S. unemployment figures for January.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar surged 1.27 Japanese yen to a closing 130.40 yen. Later,
in London, it was quoted lower at 129.60 yen. By the close of
trading in New York, the dollar had risen to 130.33 yen from 130.13
yen late Tuesday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7500 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7535 late Tuesday. In late
New York trading, the pound was quoted at $1.7470, down from $1.7531
late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8753 West German marks, down from 1.8767; 1.5960
Swiss francs, down from 1.5978; 6.3845 French francs, up from
6.3743; 1,370.50 Italian lire, down from 1,371.30; and 1.1900
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1830.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8725 West German marks, up from 1.8710; 1.5845
Swiss francs, down from 1.5985; 6.3600 French francs, up from
6.3580; 2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1100; 1,367.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,365.00; and 1.1895 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1840.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $393 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $394.25.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, gold was lower, closing at a bid of
$392.75 compared with $394.20 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.25 to close at a bid $392.30.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
rose to $393.70 an ounce from $391.60 late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices were unchanged on the London market where
the metal was trading at a late bid price of $5.85 a troy ounce. On
New York's Comex, silver for current delivery rose to $5.835 an
ounce from $5.792 late Tuesday.

   Texas Eastern Corp. said Wednesday it rejected an
offer to postpone all litigation stemming from Coastal Corp.'s $2.6
billion takeover bid because Coastal was ``demanding an advantage''
over other possible buyers.
   Coastal officials said they offered not to purchase any Texas
Eastern stock before March 15. In exchange, Coastal sought a
guarantee it would be treated fairly in the bidding process and that
Texas Eastern would erect no new obstacles to a tender offer after
that date.
   ``We are disappointed that Texas Eastern refused to agree to
treat Coastal fairly and not to enact any new poison pill,'' Coastal
President James R. Paul said.
   In response, Texas Eastern said the company is ``perfectly
willing to include Coastal in the bidding process for Texas Eastern
on the same basis as other bidders.''
   ``However, Coastal was demanding an advantage over other bidders
and attempting to limit our ability to properly act in the best
interest of our shareholders,'' the statement said.
   Texas Eastern's board last Sunday rejected Coastal's $42-a-share
offer as inadequate and urged shareholders to wait for a better
price.
   Litigation relating to Coastal's attempted takeover has spread to
three courts, including the U.S. District Court in Houston where
Coastal sought to block Texas Eastern from enacting its poison pill
plan elsewhere.

   Ryder System Inc. announced Wednesday that it will
buy back up to 15 percent of its stock and is considering selling
four subsidiaries to refocus on its core transportation businesses.
   The move was welcomed on Wall Street, where Ryder stock rose
$1.125 to close at $28.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``This is very good news for the stock, good news for the
company,'' said Andrew Geller, a transportation analyst for
Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
   The planned 2-year repurchase of up to 12 million of its 80
million outstanding shares would cost the transportation and
insurance company around $324 million, based on Tuesday's closing
price of $27 a share.
   But Miami-based Ryder expects to make a net gain of more than
$100 million by selling units that represent less than 5 percent of
its total assets, said M. Anthony Burns, Ryder's chairman, president
and chief executive officer.
   ``We are selling businesses that haven't met our financial
objectives,'' Burns said in a statement.
   The investment firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. has been engaged to
explore the possible sale of Ryder's Insurance Management Services
Division, which includes managing general insurance agencies in
Florida, Alabama and Texas, two reinsurance companies and a
reinsurance broker.
   ``While the division has been a quality provider of services to
the insurance market and a good profit contributor, it does not have
an important strategic fit with Ryder System's core business and is
probably more valuable to another company,'' Burns said.
   The company also is considering the sale of Ryder International
Freight and Customs Services Inc., a freight forwarding and customs
brokerage company; U.S. Packing and Shipping Co., a freight assembly
and distribution company; and Ryder Freight System, a full-truckload
common carrier.
   ``We want to put a sharper focus on growing our highway
transportation and aviation services core businesses,'' Burns said.
``These other businesses probably have more value and a brighter
future in the hands of other owners.''
   The moves continue efforts that started six months ago to reduce
costs and improve asset utilization, Ryder said. Nearly 900 people
have been laid off out of a total workforce of 43,000, the number of
Ryder Truck Rental district offices has been cut from 105 to 97, and
the Aircraft Services Division, which leases planes, has been split
in two.
   Burns said no new layoffs are expected.
   Ryder's aircraft leasing business is by far its fastest-growing
sector, and its vehicle leasing also accounts for a large share of
revenue, Geller said.
   ``The other parts of their business are solidly profitable but
didn't really fit with the rest of these other services,'' he said.
   Merrill Lynch analyst John Kalmbach in New York also welcomed the
Ryder moves. ``The end result will be a somewhat smaller company
with a narrower focus, disposing of companies that are not
individually very large and do not mean that much to the company in
the long run,'' he said.
   The stock buyback, to be arranged by Salomon Brothers Inc., will
begin after Ryder announces its 1988 financial results later this
month and will be financed through borrowing, Burns said.

   The Delaware Chancery Court has dismissed nine
shareholder suits filed in an attempt to block the $24.53 billion
takeover of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., RJR
Nabisco said Wednesday.
   The suits generally claimed that RJR Nabisco's board violated its
fiduciary responsibilities during bidding for the company by
Kohlberg Kravis and a management group led by president F. Ross
Johnson.
   The lawsuits were some of the last obstacles to Kohlberg Kravis'
$109-per-share offer for RJR Nabisco, set to expire at midnight
Monday.
   Earlier this week, Kohlberg Kravis announced it had reached
agreement with Federal Trade Commission staff on the sale of some
RJR Nabisco food products or Beatrice Cos. products to satisfy
antitrust concerns. KKR won Beatrice in a $6.1 billion deal in 1986.
   Still pending are lawsuits in New York by disgruntled
bondholders, including ITT Corp. and Metropolitan Life, who are
concerned that the value of their bonds declined during the bidding
late last year.

<HEAD>Hyundai Will Build Eagles For Chrysler In Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hyundai Motor Co. will build 30,000
midsize sedans a year in Canada beginning in 1991 for Chrysler
Corp., in the No. 3 automaker's first venture with a South Korean
company, Chrysler said Wednesday.
   The cars, which will be marketed as part of Chrysler's Eagle
line, will be built at Hyundai's Bromont, Quebec, plant for sale in
the United States, Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard said Wednesday.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca is expected to reveal more details
of the deal with Hyundai at a news conference in New York coinciding
with the release of Chrysler's 1988 annual earnings on Thursday.
   ``We have moved forward very rapidly in our global strategy with
major new partners both in Europe and in the Far East,'' Iacocca
said in a news release.
   Chrysler's Eagle Acclaim, which is roughly the same car has the
Mitsubishi Eclipse, is built by Mitsubishi Motors Co. in Japan. The
Eagle Premier full size sedan is designed by France's Regie
Nationale des Usines Renault and built by Chrysler in Ontario
Canada; the Eagle Talon is planned for joint production with
Mitsubishi this fall at the joint venture between the two companies
in Normal, Ill.
   The Hyundai-built Eagle will most resemble the Hyundai Sonata,
Northard said.
   ``It will be a Chrysler-badged vehicle,'' he said. ``They will be
Eagles but what Eagle designation has not been decided yet.''
   Chrysler is the last of the Big Three to have an agreement with
the South Koreans, whose currency has remained relatively stable
against the dollar while while Japanese and European currencies have
risen strongly.
   Among other Korean automakers, Daewoo Motor is 50 percent owned
by General Motors Corp. and Kia Motors is 10 percent owned by Ford
Motor Co. GM's Pontiac Division markets Daewoo's LeMans in the
United States, and Ford sells Kia's Festiva.
   Chrysler owns 21 percent of Mitsubishi, which in turn owns 7.5
percent of Hyundai.
   The dollar is trading at about 130 Japanese yen, down from 260 at
its peak in February 1985. The 50 percent decline compared with a 19
percent decline for the won, which is trading at about 680 to the
dollar compared with 840 at its peak in February 1985.

<HEAD>Bill Would Abolish Fuel-Economy Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to abolish federal fuel-economy
standards was introduced Wednesday by Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., who
argued that the rules cause the economy to suffer in Michigan and
the nation.
   Carr's bill, which he first introduced last year, would end the
corporate average fuel-economy regulations that require automakers
to attain a certain minimum gasoline mileage on average throughout
their fleets of passenger cars.
   ``CAFE is a government regulation that is simply not needed,''
said Carr. ``The time has come to put it aside. Without such a
change, the two largest domestic automakers face the unfortunate
prospect of having to limit or stop selling some of the most popular
cars in America today.''
   The fuel-economy standard for 1989 models is 26.5 miles per
gallon, a slightly more stringent level than the 26 mpg standard in
effect from 1986 through 1988 but below the 27.5 mpg set as a goal
by fuel-conservation legislation.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is considering
what standard to set for 1990 models. President Bush's new
transportation secretary, Samuel Skinner, told a Senate committee
this week he would review any mileage standard set by NHTSA.
   Carr's bill died last year without action by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, whose chairman, Rep. John Dingell, also a
Michigan Democrat, has said the fuel-economy standards appeared to
be working fairly well.
   Dingell has yet to take a position on the new legislation Carr
introduced Wednesday, the committee staff said.
   ``It's an educational process,'' said Jeff Eller, a Carr aide,
when asked about prospects for the bill this year. ``We now have a
base of members who understand why CAFE should be abolished.''
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have argued for an end to
the fuel-economy standards, saying it forces them to produce smaller
cars the buying public doesn't want in order to bring their fleets
within the mileage requirements.
   The result, they have said, is layoffs at large-car assembly
plants and a lessened ability of U.S. automakers to compete with
small-body imports.
   Chrysler Corp., with a higher proportion of smaller vehicles in
its lineup, has said it can meet the 27.5 mpg standard envisioned by
the law.

chemical that makes apples appear more appealing and last longer,
citing ``an inescapable and direct'' link to cancer that during a
lifetime could cause five deaths for every 100,000 people exposed.
   While the Environmental Protection Agency said the cancer risk is
not high enough to warrant an emergency action to remove the
chemical from the market, it urged its manufacturer to withdraw the
chemical until a final regulation banning the chemical can be issued.
   Officials said formal agency action ordering the chemical
withdrawn will not likely come for another 18 months and then is
likely to be challenged, a process that could take another one year
to three years.
   The object of the EPA's concern is a growth control chemical
called daminozide, which is sold by the trade-name Alar. The
chemical is absorbed by the fruit and has been used by apple growers
since the early 1970s to spur even growth, reduce spoilage and help
preserve apples so they can be sold all year.
   Alar's manufacturter, Uniroyal Chemcial Co. of Middlebury, Conn.,
immediately challenged the EPA findings and promised to contest any
government ban. The company said it would not withdraw its product
voluntarily.
   ``We don't see any basis for taking (Alar) off the market,''
Uniroyal spokesman Yanis Bibelnieks said. ``All of the studies that
have been done since 1985 have supported our position that Alar
poses no signficiant health risk.''
   He said it was ``inappropriate to make any judgment based on
interim results'' cited by the EPA.
   Bibelnieks said Alar production has been reduced by about 75
percent since 1985 because of the health controversy which began in
1977 when it was first thought the chemical might cause cancer. The
EPA sought to ban the chemical three years ago, but held off because
of disputes about the validity of test data.
   The EPA and industry estimated that today only about 5 percent of
the country's 200 million-bushel apple crop is sprayed with Alar,
compared with as much as 35 percent in the early 1980s. In recent
years many processors and some grocery chains have refused to buy
Alar-treated apples because of the health concerns.
   Authorities have said the threat is greatest for young children
who consume large amounts of apples, usually in processed form as
juice or sauce.
   A lawyer for the National Research Defense Council, which has
filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Alar's use, criticized the EPA for
not taking emergency action to ban the product immediately. ``The
debate ought to occur while the chemical isn't on the market,'' said
Janet Hathaway, the attorney for the Washington-based group.
   Apple growers in Washington state, meanwhile, said they were
disappointed at the EPA position and that they had hoped the agency
would give Alar its stamp of approval.
   But Charles St. John of the Washington Apple Commission said the
growers likely will voluntarily curtail Alar's user further. ``We
know it's a great tool for us to use, but by the same token if it's
going to hurt our image we don't need it,'' he said.
   The EPA said Wednesday that interim results from new studies on
test animals show in some cases the development of cancerous tumors
after exposure to daminozide.
   ``There is an inescapable and direct correlation between exposure
to UDMU (a form of daminozide) and the development of
life-threatening tumors in test mice,'' said John A. Moore, the
EPA's acting administrator.
   The EPA estimated the chances of an adult getting cancer as a
result of Alar exposure from eating apples and apple products at
five in 100,000, but it said the lifetime risk is higher for young
children because of their greater use of apple products.
   The EPA said it will begin the formal rulemaking for such a ban
within 90 days and anticipates issuing a final regulation taking
Alar off the market within 18 months. Officials acknowledged,
however, that the process could take much longer if it is contested.
   Moore said the agency could seek an emergency suspension that
would order Alar off the market within months, but he said the
agency rejected such an action because of the continuing conflicting
test data, the fact that the tests have not been completed and
because of the level of risk.
   He said that during the 18 months until a final ban is expected
the risk of an adult getting cancer as a result of Alar exposure is
at most one in 1 million, and the risk for a child nine in 1 million.
   ``We don't think that the added burden of risk (over the next 18
months) is of sufficient magnitude to warrant this kind of
(emergency) action,'' Moore told reporters.
   Derl Derr, president of the International Apple Institute, which
represents 90 percent of the country's apple growers, said Alar has
enabled growers to provide ``the top quality and moderately priced
apples they desire'' because it allows apples to remain on trees
longer, keeps them firmer, delays internal decay and prolongs shelf
life.

   A special committee of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange named the president of the futures industry's
self-regulatory organization to advise the panel in its review of
trading practices targeted by a sweeping federal fraud investigation.
   The nine-member committee appointed Robert Wilmouth, president of
the Chicago-based National Futures Association, to assist in the
review of trading procedure and policy, said Merc spokesman Andrew
Yemma.
   The committee held its first meeting Wednesday, a closed session
expected to be the first in a series to discuss trading rules and
procedures.
   Separately, in Washington the staff of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission recommended approval of the Merc's proposed
Globex electronic trading system, a key element in the exchange's
move to set up after-hours global futures trading. Electronic
trading also is seen by some as helping police improper activity by
more closely monitoring deals.
   The commission, the federal agency that regulates the futures
industry, was expected to vote on the proposal Thursday.
   Also, the House Agriculture Committee designated Rep. Glenn
English, D-Okla., to direct a congressional investigation into
trading practices in the futures and options markets.
   English, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on conservation,
credit and rural development, said the probe would focus on the
CFTC's regulation of the markets and on the self-regulating ability
of the markets themselves.
   The Merc established its review panel following disclosure of a
two-year undercover federal probe of alleged widespread fraud and
illegal trading practices in the Chicago futures markets.
   One practice under increasing scrutiny has been dual trading, in
which traders can buy and sell for themselves and their customers
simultaneously.
   The longtime practice is legal but critics say it invites abuse
of the traditional open-outcry style of commodities trading, in
which traders use shouts and hand signals to buy and sell futures
contracts in exchange trading pits.
   Karsten Mahlmann, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade,
indicated at a closed traders meeting Tuesday that the exchange may
reassess dual trading in light of the burgeoning scandal.
   And in Wednesday's editions, the Wall Street Journal reported
that ABS Partners, widely regarded as the most powerful group of
brokers at the Merc, has banned dual trading by its members to avoid
``an appearance of conflict of interest.''
   None of the ABS traders returned telephone requests Wednesday
afternoon for comment on the report.
   Such a move would be a further indication of how key futures
market players may be trying to forestall possibly stronger
government restrictions of their business in the wake of the fraud
probe.
   It also may indicate how dual trading could end up as the
scapegoat of any attempted in-house damage control, much as
computerized program trading became the target of voluntary
restrictions among a number of major Wall Street firms following the
October 1987 stock market crash.
   Broker groups such as ABS employ brokers in different exchange
trading pits _ where commodities futures contracts are actually
bought and sold _ and split losses and profits with their members.
   ABS Partners includes 24 brokers and other members and is
controlled by Maury A. Kravitz and James J. Kaulentis, two of the
Merc's wealthiest and most powerful brokers, the Journal reported.
   Kravitz is a longtime friend and former law partner of Leo
Melamed, the powerful chairman of the Merc's executive committee and
a key figure in the exchange's growth in financial futures trading,
the newspaper stated.
   In endorsing approval of the Mercantile Exchange's Globex system,
the CFTC staff recommended that Globex trading initialy be limited
to futures contracts on the Australian dollar, British pound,
Canadian dollar, West German mark, Swiss franc, Japanese yen,
Eurodollar, U.S. Treasury bills and gold.
   Globex, developed by Reuters Holding PLC, is an electronic system
which beginning this fall would be used before and after regular
exchange hours.
   Eventually, all of the exchange's contracts would be eligible for
Globex trading.

<HEAD>Say Drexel Asked Nine Congressmen to Pressure SEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. reportedly has
asked nine California members of Congress to pressure the Securities
and Exchange Commission into reducing proposed settlement terms in
its fraud case.
   Mayor Tom Bradley was a key player in the lobbying effort, the
Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday, by persuading the
congressional delegation from California to intervene on behalf of
Drexel.
   The result was three similarly worded letters from members of
Congress to SEC Chairman David Ruder demanding that the agency
abandon efforts to force Drexel to move its high-yield bond
department from Beverly Hills to the firm's New York headquarters,
the Times said.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
each wrote letters on Drexel's behalf and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los
Angeles, wrote a third letter signed by six other Los Angeles-area
lawmakers, the report said.
   The six congressmen were identified as Reps. Howard Berman, Mel
Levine, David Dreier, Carlos Moorhead, Julian C. Dixon and Augustus
F. Hawkins.
   At least seven of the nine members of Congress have received
campaign contributions or honorariums from Drexel, the Times said.
   Drexel representatives asked the three members of Congress to
express objections to an SEC demand that the firm move its so-called
``junk bond'' high-yield operation which had been headed by Michael
Milken, the key target of the federal fraud investigation.
   The firm has said that dismantling the junk bond unit would
severely hurt Drexel's leading role in the lucrative market for
these securities, commonly used to finance takeovers or finance
growth of small and medium-size takeovers.
   Drexel agreed Dec. 21 to pay the government $650 million in fines
and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settle
accusations of securities fraud.
   The plea bargain also requires Drexel to settle related
litigation with the SEC, which filed civil fraud charges against the
firm last Sept. 7.

   Occidental Petroleum Corp. agreed Wednesday to
pay the government $205 million, including interest, to settle
allegations that a subsidiary violated federal oil and gas price
control rules in the late 1970s.
   The company also reported its financial results which showed that
a $45 million provision for the settlement deeply eroded
fourth-quarter income.
   But for all of last year Occidental's profit rose 26 percent,
despite the cost of the settlement and of lost production caused by
the explosion of an Occidental oil and gas platform in the North Sea
that killed 167.
   Fourth-quarter profit declined to $7 million, or 2 cents a share,
from $38 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier, largely
because of the provision for the settlement. Sales in the quarter
were $5.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter of
1987.
   Occidental said it earned $302 million, or $1.21 a share, in
1988, up from $240 million, or $1.06 a share, the previous year.
Sales for the year were $19.4 billion, up from $17.1 billion in 1987.
   As to the settlement, the Department of Energy originally sought
$700 million from Oxy USA Inc. Oxy USA is the former Cities Service,
which Occidental bought in 1982, after the alleged violations
occurred.
   In settling the administrative case against it, Occidental didn't
admit violating department regulations. The allegations involve
actions taken from October 1979 through January 1981 and were
brought under federal price controls on oil and gas imposed after
the Arab oil embargo.
   The Energy Department press office didn't immediately respond to
questions about the settlement.
   The company agreed to pay $150 million, plus 10 percent interest,
over the course of eight years, bringing the total to $205 million.
   A first payment of $40 million will be made when the settlement
agreement becomes final, a process that involves publishing the
terms in the Federal Register and a 30-day period for comment by
interested parties.
   The balance of the settlement is to be paid, with 10.02 percent
interest, in eight annual payments of $20.6 million.
   Occidental's financial results, like those at other big oil
companies, were boosted by strong gains on petrochemicals even
though oil and gas prices were depressed.
   The company, which bought Cain Chemical Co. of Texas last year,
recorded chemical sales of $1.4 billion in 1988, up from $780
million the year before. Sales at the IBP Inc. meat-processing
subsidiary rose to $2.4 billion from $2 billion, and natural gas
transmission revenue rose to $733 million from $588 million.
   Oil and gas sales declined to $701 million from $917 million.
   The company didn't reveal the exact cost of lost production from
the July 6 explosion that destroyed Occidental's Piper Alpha
platform in the North Sea off Aberdeen, Scotland. Occidental
executives previously said it would cut year-end profit by between
$13 million and $26 million.

<HEAD>Say Consumer Confidence Dropped In January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. consumer confidence in the economy, which
sharply improved in December, relinquished some of the gain in
January, the Conference Board reported Wednesday.
   The board's Consumer Confidence Index, a mathematical calculation
designed to reflect sentiment about buying plans and borrowing,
retreated to 115.3 last month, a four-point loss from a month
earlier.
   ``The modest decline in the measure of confidence in January
represents some cooling of the enthusiasm registered in December
following the presidential election,'' said Fabian Linden, head of
the board's consumer research unit. ``Still, while the most recent
readings represent some retreat from the month before, they remain
comfortably strong.''
   At the same time, Linden said, the January decline shows ``there
apparently is some moderate apprehension about the future, as the
nation's prime economic problems _ the two deficits and the savings
and loan crisis _ increasingly become major issues in the public
debate.''
   The index is derived from a monthly survey, covering 5,000
households nationwide, conducted for the board by the National
Family Opinion of Toledo, Ohio. The index uses a 1985 base of 100.
   Buying plans fell for all major categories included in the
survey. Plans to buy cars fell to 6.8 percent from 7.4 percent a
month earlier. Concern about rising interest rates contributed to a
1 percentage point drop in home-buying plans to 2.8 percent.
   The Conference Board is a New York-based network of executives
that supports management and economic research.

   Appliance maker Allegheny International Inc.
said Wednesday that competitive pressure on its sales volume and
prices caused its first-quarter profits to fall 75 percent.
   The company, which is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy laws
and which has attracted the interest of potential buyers, earned
$1.8 million during its first quarter, down from $7.2 million a year
earlier.
   Allegheny International's first-quarter profit translated to a
per-share loss after dividend requirements. It also suffered a
per-share loss in the first quarter a year ago.
   Sales at the appliance and consumer products company dropped 13
percent to $227 million from $256.2 million.
   A group led by the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. has offered to buy Allegheny International for $812
million.
   However, Allegheny International has disagreed with the terms of
a buyout agreement it reached with DLJ, and it has asked a federal
bankruptcy judge to void the proposed transaction.
   Last week the company filed a proposed plan of reorganization,
which if approved in bankruptcy court would lead to the sale of the
Sunbeam-Oster appliance division.
   The Pittsburgh-based company would retain its businesses in
outdoor furniture, electric blankets, clocks, weather instruments
and scales.
