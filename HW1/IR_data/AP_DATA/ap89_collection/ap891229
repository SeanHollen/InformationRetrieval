   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Friday
he has decided against prosecution or disciplinary action over a
news leak about a Pennsylvania Congressman because the department
can't identify the leaker.
   In a letter to Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, Thornburgh said investigators had been
``unable to identify with certainy the original source'' of
unauthorized disclosures to CBS reporter Rita Braver about the
office of Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   Thornburgh said the investigators also told him that ``the
nature of the confirmations alleged to have been forthcoming to Ms.
Braver'' were ``uncertain.''
   Consequently, he said, the investigators told him that ``it
would be futile and impossible to pursue a prosecution based on the
available evidence.''
   ``Therefore, I have accepted the recommendation of the
investigators and prosecutors that this matter be closed without
prosecution,'' the attorney general said.
   ``Furthermore, since the investigation has not produced
sufficient evidence to enable me to ascertain that any present
employees of the Department of Justice was responsible for the
disclosure, I have determined that no termination of employment or
other disciplinary action is justified in this matter at this
time.''
   The leak occurred while Gray was seeking election in the House
as majority whip, prompting accusations from Democratic lawmakers
that Thornburgh's aides were the source of a political leak.
   Two weeks after Ms. Braver's broadcast that Gray's office was
being investigated, the Justice Department stated that Gray was not
a target of the investigation and was cooperating with the probe.
   Gray, who was elected whip, said the day after the broadcast he
had been told by FBI agents from the Philadelphia office in a
Memorial Day interview that he was not a target and that they were
looking into the possibility that one of his employees held a
no-show job. Nothing more has been heard of that investigation.
   Thornburgh said he wrote to Biden because the Judiciary
chairman, at a committee hearing June 2 at which Thornburgh
testified, ``raised questions with regard to my concerns over
unauthorized disclosure of information.''
   Biden said in a statement that Thornburgh wrote him that the
department's Office of Professional Responsibility concurred with
all conclusions and recommendations of the Criminal Division in the
matter. But the senator said committee staff members had checked
with the Office of Professional Responsibility and though that
office had been consulted, ``It has never seen the criminal
division report or any of its conclusions, and therefore could not
have an has not concurred in those conclusions.''
   Normally, the Office of Professional Responsibility would be
responsible for recommending disciplinary action against department
employees.
   Thornburgh's spokesman, David Runkel, said, ``I don't know whom
Sen. Biden or his staff has been talking to, but that statement is
clearly at odds with what the attorney general was told by the
criminal division.
   The head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, Michael
E. Shaheen, does not have a listed telephone number.
   Thornburgh told the senator that 11 FBI agents devoted
approximately 385 days to the investigation, interviewing members
of the U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia
division of the FBI, FBI headquarters, the criminal division of the
Justice Department and the attorney general's office.
   He said about 30 other persons were also interviewed, including
members of Congress, aides to Gray, confidential sources and
several reporters. Ms. Braver ``declined to be interviewed or
otherwise cooperate with this investigation,'' he said.
   Gray said in a statement from Philadelphia: ``The failure of
this investigation raises the white flag of surrender to those in
the Department of Justice who use false leaks to defame innocent
citizens. The leaks in this case were designed to harm me, but
their real victim was the integrity of our criminal justice
system.''
   CBS said Ms. Braver was on vacation.

   In the passion that fueled Romania's
revolution, ``freedom'' was spoken again and again. But to a people
forced to register even their typewriters, the full meaning of the
exotic word was difficult to grasp.
   ``What is it to live free, to travel free, to speak freely?''
mused Ioana Popescu, a 21-year-old medical student. ``We have only
seen dark and silence.''
   Over the moans of the wounded in a crowded hospital ward, she
and some fellow volunteers considered what the term ``freedom''
meant.
   ``We can't realize what freedom is,'' said Anda Preda, also 21,
to an American reporter. ``You grew up in freedom, and you do not
realize what this means to us.''
   She paused and frowned, and apologized for her poor English.
   ``I'm sorry,'' she said. ``I've learned English 11 years, and
this is the first time I speak it.''
   Until young Romanians such as herself helped overthrow Nicolae
Ceausescu, every such contact with a foreigner would have to be
reported to the despised secret police, the Securitate. People
could leave Romania only in the rarest of circumstances.
   Ceausescu's ears were everywhere. People spoke in whispers,
trusting only the closest of friends. An indiscreet word, even the
wrong gesture in delicate moments, could alter an entire life.
   For young Romanians, it had been that way all of their lives.
Most of their parents were born under Stalinism, and their
grandparents lived through a world war.
   Suddenly, it was all over. Or was it?
   ``Even now, it is like a dream,'' said Ms. Popescu, days after
Ceausescu was toppled. ``Maybe I will wake up and it is gone.''
   Bogdan Lazarae did not expect freedom to go away, but he was not
sure what it was. At 21, he is an engineering student with a
searching soul. He has been helping doctors until nightfall and
then manning a subway checkpoint until morning.
   ``We don't know what this means, freedom,'' he said.
   ``We don't know what to do with freedom. We have no experience,
no model, no idea.''
   In his first free moments, Lazarae worked as a translator for
reporters trying to understand Romania. At times he is just as
confused as the outsiders.
   ``I am afraid people will ask me what I am doing with
foreigners, but no one asks. That's a little bit of freedom. I am
afraid to speak the name of Ceausescu in the street, maybe someone
will tell me I'm an enemy, but they don't. That's a little bit of
freedom.''
   Mainly, he said, ``to be free is to talk free, to say what you
want. It is very bad to hide what you are thinking. It is not
healthy. It is not dignified.''
   All over Romania, people are experimenting with the elusive
concept they fought so hard to obtain.
   At the University of Bucharest, historian Stephan Andrescu
described freedom as a lost treasure enjoyed by Romanians for most
of the time between 1865 and the tumult of the World War II.
   At the National Library, where 10 percent of the books were
shown only to people with clearance from the secret police, freedom
has a specific meaning.
   ``What is essential is freedom of the mind,'' said Angela
Brodiceni, library director. ``We will face many problems, many
trials. But now our minds are free.''
   At the hilltop Metropolitan Cathedral, Ionita Victoria thanks
God for freedom of worship. She was afraid to go to church in a
country where police noted names of the religious, but she braved
sniper fire when those police lost their power.
   At the Agerpres news agency, an editor who is still reluctant to
be quoted by name is grateful for the freedom to report without
hiding most of the truth. He wept out of control as he tried to
purge his guilt for not resisting earlier on his own.
   The concept of freedom takes different shapes depending upon the
surroundings. At the Bucharest emergency hospital, it hits hard.
   Ms. Popescu looked at the casualties lying on stretchers in the
narrow hallway.
   ``You have to respect this thing freedom when you think of the
price it carries,'' she said.
   But it takes its broadest meaning on street corners where for
the first time in 45 years people can shout out their opinions to
foreigners.
   Near the bombed-out Communist Party Central Committee building,
a small group of people waited their turn to speak to American
reporters about what they felt they had won.
   Not one could finish his piece with dry eyes.
   Toma Cornelia called out that he had a sister in Loveland,
Colo., named Ilie Botezatu. She went to the United States to flee
Ceausescu's Romania.
   ``You tell her we are starting a new life,'' he said. ``Tell her
we are waiting for her.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A thunderous roar and a huge light
filled the sky at the Panamanian base in Rio Hato. The building
rattled and shook.
   Pedro, who thought he had too much to drink, later found out he
was on the receiving end of the first attack by a U.S. Stealth
fighter jet.
   ``I was sleeping with this bottle of dry rum,'' said Pedro, a
civilian contractor with the Panamanian Defense Forces. ``I woke
trying to figure out what was causing the commotion, the rum or
something else.
   ``Everybody was running around. Nobody seemed to know what to do
which was kind of strange for a bunch of soldiers who supposedly
were expecting a U.S. invasion.''
   It was Dec. 20, just before 1 a.m., and Pedro was spending the
night at the base in Rio Hato, 80 miles southwest of Panama City.
   What he saw was part of a coordinated attack to dismantle the
regime of military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   A unit of the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division was dropping in
to capture the Panamanian base, and the new supersonic Stealth
F-117 had dropped two 2,000-pound bombs nearby in an effort to stun
the base's defenders.
   The building where he was sleeping shook and it ``felt like the
plane was passing just over the building,'' said Pedro, who was
later captured by the invading U.S. troops.
   He was released within a few days and spoke to The Associated
Press on Thursday on the condition he not be further identified for
fear of reprisals.
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney acknowledged last week the use
of the Stealth fighters in the Panama invasion. The U.S. military
said the F-117 was used because it can bomb accurately and that
2,000-pound weapons were dropped to ``stun and disorient.''
   They did.
   ``They were experimenting with us, I guess,'' Pedro laughed.
   ``We were disoriented. I looked outside. It was almost a full
moon and I could see the shapes of the paratroopers coming down.
Then the sky lit up and the helicopters started shooting up the
place.
   ``We grabbed weapons and went out toward the woods. We saw the
Cobra helicopters firing and flying over the area. Then the
soldiers would come in and use loudspeakers to ask people to
surrender.
   ``We came back closer to the barracks and all of a sudden I
heard Americans saying we were there. They must have spotted us
somehow.
   ``I was between the commander and the sergeant and the soldiers.
I started moving and all of a sudden I was almost face to face with
a soldier. I told him `I give up, don't kill me. I am a civilian.'
''
   ``Then they tied me up. I spent the next 12 hours with the other
prisoners ... Then they moved us to Howard Air Base in Panama and
the civilians were separated and we were treated a lot better.''
   ``I cannot complain,'' he ended. ``They even gave me some oxygen
when I suffered an emphysema attack.''

   An unknown group has claimed responsibility for
mail bombs that killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer,
and has threatened future assassinations ``anytime a black man
rapes a white woman,'' authorities said Thursday.
   The claim was made in a letter received Wednesday by WAGA-TV in
Atlanta from a group calling itself Americans for a Competent
Federal Judicial System, said Al Adams, a spokesman for the Postal
Inspection Service in Atlanta.
   The letter was postmarked Dec. 21 in Atlanta. An NAACP official
said his organization received a similar letter on Dec. 22.
   In its 6 p.m. news broadcast, WAGA-TV released excerpts of the
letter from the group, which claimed it ``assassinated Judge Robert
S. Vance and attorney Robert Robinson in reprisal for atrocities
committed on Julie Love,'' a white woman who was robbed, raped and
murdered in Atlanta in 1988.
   ``Two more prominent members of the NAACP shall be assassinated,
using more sophisticated means, as part of the same reprisal,'' the
letter said.
   William L. Hinshaw, special agent in charge of the FBI
investigation in Atlanta, said in a statement Thursday evening that
none of the agencies investigating the mail bombings was familiar
with the group.
   ``We believe that the letter received by WAGA is authentic
because it contained information which has not been made known to
the public and which is known only to someone closely associated
with the construction and mailing of the bombs, and to law
enforcement,'' Hinshaw said.
   He said the letter made a threat against the television station
if it did not air portions of the letter.
   ``Because the letter indicated that additional attacks might be
forthcoming if the TV station did not comply with the stated demand
to read a portion of the letter, we encouraged WAGA to broadcast
that portion of the letter and distribute this information to other
news organizations,'' Hinshaw said.
   WAGA reported at 11 p.m. that the letter told of a secret
meeting the group held Dec. 19 in Montgomery, Ala., after the two
fatal bombings. The station said members from Georgia, Florida and
Alabama gathered ``to draft new orders'' and to go public with
their mission.
   ``Investigators have confirmed to officials of WAGA-TV that the
document may be authentic and related to the recent bombing
attacks,'' Hinshaw said.
   Authorities have been investigating a series of mail bombs that
killed Vance, an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge at his
home near Birmingham, Ala., on Dec. 16 and Robinson, a Savannah,
Ga., lawyer two days later.
   The bomb that killed Vance was mailed to his home in Mountain
Brook, Ala., the same suburb where Ms. Love grew up.
   ``Anytime a black man rapes a white woman in Alabama, Florida or
Georgia in the future, Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial
System shall assassinate one federal judge, one attorney and one
officer of the NAACP,'' the letter said.
   The group criticized the 11th Circuit on which Vance served, for
what it called reluctance ``to stress the importance of blacks to
demonstrate civil responsibility.''
   ``This failure created a climate that has spawned an alarming
number of savage acts of violence by black men against white
women,'' the letter said.
   It cited the slaying of Ms. Love, 27, a pre-school fitness
teacher who disappeared July 11, 1988, after her car ran out of
gas. Her remains were found a little over a year later, in a wooded
lot near an inner-city neighborhood.
   Two young black men, Emmanuel Fitzgerald Hammond, 24, and
William Maurice Porter, 20, have been charged in the slaying.
Porter pleaded guilty in November and is expected to testify
against Hammond in his forthcoming trial.
   Sources close to the bomb investigation said last week that
follow-up threatening letters received by targets of the mail bombs
contained references to ``Americans for a Competent Judiciary.'' At
the time, the FBI said it did not know the significance of the
references.
   Two other bombs were safely removed from the 11th Circuit
building in Atlanta and NAACP headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Investigators believe the attacks may have been carried out by
white racists.
   Earl Shinhoster, Southeastern regional director for the NAACP,
said security precautions were being taken by NAACP workers at the
600 Southeastern branches, 130 of which are in Georgia.
   Shinhoster said he received an unsigned letter at his office
Dec. 22 that used similar language as that in the letter sent to
WAGA. But the television station's letter, Shinhoster said, ``is
much more specific.''
   The typewritten letter to the NAACP, also postmarked in Atlanta,
also mentioned the Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial
System.
   Before being appointed to the federal bench, Vance preached
moderation on racial issues while chairman of the Alabama
Democratic Party. Robinson, a Savannah city alderman, was black and
did legal work for the NAACP.
   A Hagerstown, Md., judge was wounded by a bomb last week, but
investigators said they have all but ruled out a connection to the
other attacks.
   On Aug. 21, an anonymous letter was sent to Jackson, Miss., TV
station WAPT declaring war on the 11th Circuit, authorities said.
The next day, a tear gas canister exploded at the Atlanta office of
the Atlanta NAACP, injuring eight people.
   Vickie Taylor, assignment editor at WAPT, said Thursday that the
August letter was not signed by any group in particular but that
it, too, complained in similar language about partiality in the
judiciary.
   Ms. Taylor said her station has not received any follow-up
letters recently.

   When the Rev. C. Michael Thornburg,
Anglican scholar and rector of Christ Church, turned to his
ultimate boss with a plea for help out of a financial bind, he
didn't expect such a quick respone.
   Thornburg said he prayed, ``You got me into this, now get me
out.''
   Thirty minutes later, Harold D. Hayes, one of the contractors
who provides bus service for the Southern Berkshire Regional School
District knocked on the rectory door and a second career was born.
   Twice each school day Thornburg takes the wheel of a big yellow
school bus in this little Berkshire Hills town.
   ``This has turned out to be one of the best parts of being in
Sheffield,'' he said recently.
   He described his unusual second job as the answer to his prayers

   The expert on the history of the Anglican Church and the

close eye on icy roads.
   ``I'm the first adult the children see outside their homes each

about themselves entering the day.''
   Of course, he said. ``I don't hesitate to yell at them and tell
them to sit down.''

<HEAD>Cable Industry Says There's More Sports on TV Than Ever Before</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cable television industry is firing back
at critics who claim sports on ``free television'' are becoming
extinct, saying there is more sports programming on TV than ever.
   Total broadcast network sports programming rose to a record
1,753 hours in 1988, an Olympics year, according to a study
released Thursday by the National Cable Television Association.
   At the same time, the study said:
   _Local broadcast stations increased their coverage of Major
League Baseball games to 1,647 games in the 1989 season, up from
1,536 in 1985.
   _ABC, CBS and NBC increased their college football coverage by
52 percent, from 27 regular season games in 1987 to 41 games in
1989.
   _National network broadcast coverage of both National Collegiate
Athletic Association regular and post-season games grew by 21
percent over the past four years, from 86 games in the 1986-87
season to 104 games in the current 1989-90 season.
   The cable group acknowledged the huge growth of cable TV sports
programming during the 1980s, but said it had been achieved
``without depleting broadcast television sports coverage.''
   The growth of cable ``has expanded viewers' sports programming
options by providing coverage of games and sports which have either
never been available to broadcasters or which have been ignored by
broadcast TV,'' NCTA said in the study, ``Fair Games: Broadcast and
Cable Coverage of Televised Sports.''
   The study comes at a time when critics in Congress and
broadcasting are saying cable is siphoning sports away from
so-called free television. At hearings in November, Sens. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said sports such as
professional baseball and football could lose their antitrust
exemptions if they reduce the amount of free sports programming.
   Lawmakers have been particularly concerned about two recent
cable sports deals: a 12-year, $550 million agreement by the New
York Yankees giving all TV rights to the Madison Square Garden
cable network beginning in 1991; and Major League Baseball's
12-year, $400 million contract with the ESPN cable network to show
175 baseball games a year beginning next season.
   Madison Square Garden has been negotiating with a local
broadcaster in New York, WPIX, to provide 40 to 50 Yankees games a
season. WPIX previously has carried Yankees games.
   Under ESPN's contract, the national cable network will be able
to black out all other baseball coverage on Wednesday nights.
   National Football League executive Art Modell told the Senate
hearings there was ``a good chance'' the NFL will increase the
number of regular season games on cable next year to 16, up from
eight.
   Metzenbaum worried aloud that cable's ability to generate income
both through advertising and subscriptions gives it an advantage in
negotiating for sports programming.
   However, NBC recently agreed to a four-year contract that will
increase the number of nationally televised National Basketball
Association games.
   But the cable organization's study showed that regional cable
coverage of NBA games will surpass local broadcast station coverage
for the first time in the 1989-90 season: 790 games to 716 games.
Regional cable carried 638 games last season, compared with 679
games on local broadcast stations.
   ``The vast majority of cable's sports programming does not
consist of events or games which have `migrated' from over-the-air
television,'' the study said. ``Cable's increased presence in
sports programming has served to expand viewers' access to sporting
events without depleting broadcast television sports coverage.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Two Tyrants, Eerie Parallels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the surface, Panama's Manuel Antonio
Noriega and Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu had little in common aside
from the heavy-handed way in which they ran their respective
countries.
   One was a tropical tyrant for whom ideology meant nothing. The
other, irreverently described as the ``butcher of Bucharest,''
viewed the world in terms of the Marxist philosophy he had embraced
as a teen-ager.
   But there are some eerie parallels between the two, not the
least of which was the way the ups and downs in their relations
with the United States reflected the fluctuations of U.S. policy
between expediency and morality.
   One historical oddity was that both Ceausescu and Noriega had
their definitive falling out with the United States on the same day
_ Feb. 26, 1988. Last week, their tyrannical rules ended within two
days of each other.
   When both were riding high, there were periods in which the
United States overlooked their more disreputable qualities in
pursuit of its anti-Soviet policies. In the end, once their
usefulness had been squandered, both were widely reviled in
Washington for the way in which they had brutalized their
respective peoples.
   Ceausescu had been an admired figure in Washington during the
1970's. President Nixon visited Bucharest early in his first term
and Ceausescu was given a red carpet welcome by President Carter at
the White House in 1978.
   All this was Washington's way of showing gratitude to a man
viewed as a maverick in the Warsaw Pact for his willingness to
adopt stands independent of the Soviet Union.
   He denounced the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, maintained
normal ties with Israel at a time when no other Pact member did,
refused to take part in alliance military maneuvers and extended
the hand of friendship to China when Moscow and Beijing were at
loggerheads.
   The United States offered Romania trade concessions and export
credits as part of a strategy to encourage other alliance members
to show independence from Moscow. Ceausescu's Stalinist internal
policies were a secondary consideration.
   Noriega, meanwhile, also was being cultivated by the United
States during the latter part of the 1970s when he was Panama's
chief of military intelligence.
   He was viewed as an intelligence asset, providing the United
States with information on Cuban activities in Central America. In
the 1980s, Noriega was considered a potential asset for the Reagan
administration in its effort to topple Nicaragua's leftist
government. How much assistance he actually provided is not clear.
   U.S. officials were aware that Noriega was involved in
drug-smuggling activities but felt he was minor figure before
becoming head of the Defense Forces in August 1983. In that same
year, then-Vice President George Bush met with Noriega during a
visit to Panama.
   The deterioration in relations with Panama accelerated after
Noriega's indictment by two Florida grand juries on drug smuggling
charges in early February 1988. The definitive break occurred Feb.
26, when his allies in the Panamanian legislature impeached
President Eric Arturo Delvalle just hours after he attempted to
fire Noriega as defense chief.
   Hours later on that same day, the State Department disclosed
that Ceausescu had unilaterally renounced the trade privileges
Romania had had for more than a decade. If Ceausescu had not taken
the action, Congress would have done so, primarily based on
Romania's tight restrictions on emigration.
   In any case, Romania's usefulness as a Warsaw Pact maverick had
steadily diminished with rise of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet
Union and the waning of the Cold War. When Ceausescu fled last
Friday, on the morning following the calendar's longest night of
the year, he was increasingly looked on as an anachronism.
   A final parallel between Ceausescu and Noriega: at the precise
moment Ceausescu was fleeing the presidential palace, across the
Atlantic, the Organization of American States, after an all-night
session, was expressing regret by an overwhelming vote over the
U.S. decision to oust Noriega by force.

   Former Olympic star Nadia Comaneci, who fled
Romania just weeks before the government was toppled and leader
Nicolae Ceausescu executed, hopes to visit her homeland after its
crisis ends.
   Ms. Comaneci, 28, said Thursday that her defection Nov. 28 so
embarrassed the old regime that Romania's secret police were
ordered to hunt her down and return her to Romania.
   Comments from Ms. Comaneci were included in a news release
announcing that David Frost's production company would make a movie
about her.
   ``I hope that through the movie and public statements I can be
of more help to my countrymen than by returning to live in
Bucharest,'' she said. ``However, I hope to visit Romania as soon
as the situation returns to normal.''
   Ms. Comaneci has been granted political asylum and plans to
settle in California.

   Texan Brad Johnson, a former professional rodeo
competitor, says ``life experiences'' were more important than
formal training in his acting career.
   Johnson, featured in the Steven Spielberg movie ``Always'' with
Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss, said he sat in on an acting
class for about 90 minutes in Los Angeles one night.
   ``That was all I could take,'' said Johnson in an interview
published in The Dallas Morning News on Thursday. ``I think acting
is just calling upon past life experiences. And, God, I've had a
bunch of those in a full 30 years.''
   Before becoming a rodeo performer, the Irving native had a
variety of jobs, including stints fighting fires, cleaning up a
slaughterhouse, pumping gas and repossessing cars.
   ``So when I pick up a script and read it, I think, `I know that
guy. I met that guy.' I feel like that's my training,'' Johnson
said.

   Buffalo Bills fullback Larry Kinnebrew
has been charged with assault after a scuffle outside a hotel.
   Kinnebrew, 29, and a Virginia man were arrested at 2:47 a.m.
Wednesday outside the Ramada Renaissance Inn in this Buffalo
suburb, Officer Michael Dorobiala said Thursday.
   Dorobiala said the charge was lodged by the hotel's security
guards. He didn't have details of the altercation between Kinnebrew
and Vincent White, 22, of Richmond, Va. Nobody was hurt in the
incident, Dorobiala said.
   Kinnebrew is a starting fullback for the Buffalo Bills, who play
the Cleveland Browns in the National Football League playoffs on
Jan 6. His arrest wasn't expected to prevent him from playing in
the game.
   Kinnebrew's telephone number is unlisted and a Bills spokesman
was unavailable for comment on the incident Thursday.

tourism.
   The former Milwaukee Braves baseball player _ better known for
his appearances in commercials _ agreed to donate his services to
the 1990 campaign, as he has in the past, officials announced
Thursday.
   One of the advertising agencies involved in the project
suggested dumping Uecker this year, but the state Tourism Council,
mindful of the success of previous campaigns, decided to use him
again.
   ``Record responses for Wisconsin tourism information came as the
result of past Uecker spots,'' said Richard Matty, administrator of
the state Division of Tourism Development.
   Uecker broadcasts Milwaukee Brewers games.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Urges Most Favored Nation Status for Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a law that discriminates against
trade with Communist countries is asking President Bush to remove
all tariff restrictions from the ``revitalized nation'' of
Czechoslovakia.
   Charles A. Vanik wrote Bush this week saying the official
decrees published by the pro-democracy reformists running
Czechoslovakia have ``clearly met all conditions'' of the law he
co-sponsored with the late Senator Henry Jackson in 1974.
   The Jackson-Vanik amendment, which in essence imposes high
tariffs on countries that forbid free emigration, was designed to
pressure the Communist bloc into allowing Jews and other minorities
to emigrate. It forbids granting such countries Most Favored Nation
trade status that significantly reduces tariffs on imports into the
United States.
   Czechoslovakia has been actively seeking Most Favored Nation
status since early this year, but was told by the administration
that dramatic improvements would have to be made in its human
rights record.
   A State Department official said Thursday that consideration is
being given to granting Czechoslovakia's wish in light of the
fast-paced reforms away from totalitarian Communist rule.
   The two new Czechoslovak leaders, Vaclav Havel and Alexander
Dubcek, were subjected to severe human rights violations under the
Communists who ran the country until two months ago, Vanik said.
Dubcek was elected speaker of Parliament on Thursday and Havel was
scheduled for swearing-in as president today. New elections are
expected next year.
   The new leadership has amended Czechoslovakia's constitution to
remove the Communist Party's monopoly on power and the predominance
of Marxist-Leninist teachings in the school system. In addition,
lawmakers voted Thursday to amend the presidential oath to be taken
by Havel to eliminate the pledge of allegiance to socialism.
   ``The most important thing America can do is provide an
immediate fair and equal access to our markets,'' said Vanik, a
lawyer in private practice here who was a Democrat representing an
Ohio district when the law was passed.
   ``I urge that you declare this revitalized nation eligible for
Most Favored Nation status and the same tariff benefits we extend
to all our other trading partners,'' he asked Bush.
   Bush recently lifted the Jackson-Vanik restrictions from
Hungary, granting it Most Favored Nation status in response to
moves in that country toward democratic rule.
   ``He could do the same for Czechoslovakia,'' Vanik said. ``It
wouldn't cost him anything and would be a great way to tell them we
support what they're doing.''
   Bush also has indicated he would be willing to grant Most
Favored Nation status to the Soviet Union if it adopts laws, now
under consideration, permitting free emigration.
   Czechoslovakia exports glass products, machine tools and other
light industrial goods.

<HEAD>Defector Says Castro Had Plan for Attack on Florida Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1983, during a time of tension in the
Caribbean, a ``hysterical'' Cuban President Fidel Castro developed
a contingency plan to launch an air strike against a nuclear power
facility in south Florida, according to a Cuban defector.
   Gen. Rafael del Pino, who defected to the United States in 1986,
said Castro was worried about a possible U.S. blockade of Cuba at
the time of the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in October 1983.
   Del Pino said Castro summoned the high military command and
ordered them, as a contingency, to have the computers aboard MiG-23
fighter planes programmed to fly to a nuclear energy plant in south
Florida.
   An air strike was to have been ordered if there were ``some type
of blockade of Cuba, some type of reaction on the part of the
United States, a product of the situation in Grenada,'' he said.
   The spokesman at the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington was
unavailable for comment Thursday on del Pino's allegations.
   The invasion of Grenada generated anxiety in Cuba because the
two governments had established close political and military ties.
Cuban officials were concerned that Cuba might be the next target
of the Reagan administration but no action was taken.
   Del Pino said Castro has a ``holocaust temperament'' that
emerges during difficult periods. At the time of Grenada, he said,
Castro was ``hysterical.''
   Del Pino, the highest ranking Cuban ever to defect, commented in
an interview with Radio Marti, the Voice of America broadcast
operation to Cuba. A transcript was made available Thursday.
   The installation del Pino was referring to apparently was Turkey
Point, about 24 miles south of Miami where two nuclear generators
are located. The facility is operated by Florida Power &amp; Light Co.
and is adjacent to Homestead Air Force Base, which closely monitors
all incoming flights in the area.
   According to del Pino, the Cuban MiG's are equipped with
conventional as opposed to nuclear bombs.
   Nonetheless, he said, Castro ``doesn't realize that if this
plant is destroyed, it would not only annihilate all the Cubans in
Miami but would also be much worse than Chernobyl because the
radioactivity would fall on Cuba. In other words, 90 miles away,
the Cuban people would be affected because of the absurd reaction
of that man (Castro).''
   Chernobyl is the site in the Soviet Union where a major accident
occurred at a nuclear power facility in 1986.
   Unlike the Chernobyl plant, all active commercial U.S. nuclear
reactors are surrounded by steel-reinforced concrete shells to
prevent the release of radioactivity in an accident. But the shells
are not meant to shield the reactor against bombs, according to
Frank Ingraham, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman.
   Dale Thomas, a spokesman at Florida Power &amp; Light, declined
comment when asked if the firm has taken into account the
possibility of an attack by Cuban planes.
   He said the company's security precautions are not public
information for the most part. He added that the company does have
an emergency planning zone extending 10 miles from the Turkey Point
installations. Among other steps, the plan includes procedures for
evacuating all residents within the zone.

   High school students are going ahead with
their New Year's Eve ``Lock-In,'' a drug- and alcohol-free party,
even though far fewer students have signed up this year than last.
   As at similar parties, the doors at Masuk High School's second
annual Lock-In will be kept shut so sober revelers can't go out and
get in trouble.
   ``Call me crazy, but I think being sober and watching the ball
drop is a lot more fun,'' said Lock-In Chairwoman Elizabeth Rhodes,
a junior.
   About 140 students had signed up to attend the party at the high
school, a smaller crowd than last year's 250, but enough to avoid
canceling the party, she said.
   ``We fell somewhat short, but psychologically, I can't cancel
out,'' she said.
   Students will ring in the new year with dancing, carnival games,
sports, contests, pizza and door prizes that include a color
television set.

   Is little Salt Rock too small for two
Shirley Bledsoes?
   Shirley Jean thinks so. Shirley Rae thinks not. And the West
Virginia Supreme Court doesn't want to get involved.
   ``The feud has gone on for 12 years, and I think it's about time
for it to end,'' Shirley Rae Bledsoe, 47, said Thursday from her
home in the Cabell County community of 900 in the western part of
the state.
   The two Shirleys have been at odds with each other since the
1977 death of Lloyd Bledsoe, who was Shirley Rae's common-law
husband and Shirley Jean's brother. Shirley Rae continued using
Lloyd's surname on her credit cards and driver's license.
   The feud intensified in May when Shirley Rae _ then Shirley Rae
Lambert _ went to Circuit Court to legally take Lloyd's name.
Shirley Rae said she had lived with Lloyd Bledsoe for 20 years, and
that he was the father of two of her children.
   The court allowed her to change her name to Bledsoe.
   Shirley Jean, who says the similar names have resulted in mail
problems, then appealed the lower court's ruling to the state
Supreme Court, which refused in a 4-1 ruling to hear the case
earlier this month.
   ``I'm not the one that's caused the confusion. She is,'' Shirley
Rae said. ``She had been told by the post office a long time ago to
put her middle initial or her box office number on her mail, but
she bulled up and wouldn't do it.''
   Shirley Rae said any problems with the name change have been
strictly Shirley Jean's.
   ``I know I wasn't in the wrong and everybody else around Salt
Rock knows it too,'' she said. ``You can change your name to
anything you want as long as you don't hurt anybody and I wasn't
hurting her.''
   Shirley Jean refused to comment on the matter.
   ``I don't want to get involved,'' Shirley Jean said Thursday.
   The town's postmaster isn't taking sides, but said mail delivery
hasn't been a hassle with the Bledsoes or any of the town's other
six people who have similar names.
   ``We've had both of them ever since I've been here and we've
never had any problem,'' said Leah Gill, Salt Rock's postmaster for
19 years. ``If it's addressed correctly, then they get it.''
   And while names of a different sort continue to be exchanged
between the two Bledsoes, most of the town refuses to take sides.
   Leonard Bledsoe said he may be distantly related to one of the
Shirley Bledsoes, but he won't get in the middle of their feud.
   ``That's their problem,'' he said. ``They'll just have to fight
it out.''

<HEAD>Beef vs. Chicken: Preference Level Depends on the Bones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beef continues to be No. 1 with American
consumers over chicken, but that is only when the Agriculture
Department doesn't count bones.
   The USDA estimates per capita meat and poultry consumption in
several ways, including the retail weight sold at grocery counters,
and on a retail weight basis without bones.
   If it's the National Cattlemen's Association on an
end-of-the-year campaign to boost beef, the no-bone way is favored.
   Regardless, the association said Thursday that demand for beef
is stabilizing after declining for years. And part of the reason is
that farmers and ranchers have responded to consumer tastes by
producing leaner cuts.
   Looking ahead to 1990, industry leaders said little change is
expected in average per capita beef supplies and average consumer
prices in the coming year.
   According to USDA economists, total beef output may increase
slightly next year but still will remain below production levels in
the 1983-88 period. However, consumer prices are expected to edge
higher by only 1 percent to 2 percent in 1990, compared with 5
percent gains in 1988 and 1989.
   The USDA has figures to prove Americans eat more poultry than
beef. And other figures to prove they eat more beef than poultry.
   Using the method based on bone-in retail weights, USDA says the
per capita consumption of beef in 1990 may drop slightly to an
average of 67.8 pounds from 68.6 pounds in 1989, 72.1 pounds in
1988, and 73.4 pounds in 1987. The peak was 94 pounds in 1976.
   Total poultry, which includes broilers, baking hens and turkeys,
has been setting records annually and is forecast to average 89.4
pounds in 1990, up from 84.4 in 1989, 80.6 in 1988, and 77.8 in
1987, the year when poultry first nudged ahead of beef.
   But the cattle industry said that if you take away the bones,
beef is still way ahead of poultry, and Richard Stillman of USDA's
Economic Research Service agreed.
   Stillman said that on a boneless basis, 1989 per capita beef
consumption may average 67.1 pounds, down from 68.2 in 1988. A
further slight decline is expected in 1990.
   On the same boneless basis, he said, 1989 poultry consumption
may average 59.9 pounds, up from 57.2 pounds in 1988, with another
gain in the works next year.
   Cattle industry leader John Lacey of Paso Robles, Calif.,
president-elect of the National Cattlemen's Association, said the
practice of cutting away fat from retail cuts has helped improve
beef's image. He also cited breeding and feeding advances as
further boosts for the industry.
   Topper Thorpe, general manager of Cattle-Fax, a market
information service, said no dramatic changes are expected in the
nation's cattle herd or in U.S. beef production in 1990.
   But today's total cattle herd of about 100 million head,
including dairy animals, is producing almost as much beef as the
much larger herds of the 1970s, Thorpe told a year-end news
conference.
   Cattle herds peaked at about 132 million head in the mid-1970s
and generally have trended downward because of oversupply, rising
production costs, drought and other factors. Thorpe said the herd
liquidation has ended and a ``modest expansion'' has begun.
   ``Efficient cow-calf operators have made profits during the past
few years,'' Thorpe said. ``Now, if weather is favorable and if
financing becomes cheaper, more producers may hold back heifers and
expand their breeding herds. However, we do not see foresee rapid
expansion.''
   Stillman said in a telephone interview, ``Part of the reason
beef has been declining the last several years was that we've
corrected (the statistics) to allow for a closer trim on retail
cuts.''
   The main reason that today's smaller cattle herd produces almost
as much beef is due to a number of factors, he said.
   ``Genetically, you bred a larger animal,'' Stillman said. ``It's
true in hogs, sheep and lambs ... basically, it's feeding, an
increase in average weights.''
   At last month's USDA outlook conference, economist Steve Reed
said consumer beef prices have set new records each year since
1987. But competition from pork and poultry will have an effect.
   ``With per capita beef supplies beginning to stabilize in 1990,
the higher price of beef compared to competing meats could become a
bigger issue in the coming months,'' Reed said. ``These large
poultry supplies and continued large pork supplies could hold down
beef price gains.''

<TEXT>
   The government, making its annual forecast of
winners and losers in American business, says jet aircraft and
other high-technology areas will be strong in 1990, but automakers
and construction firms will not fare as well.
   The Commerce Department assessed the prospects of 350 U.S.
industries for its 31st edition of the ``U.S. Industrial Outlook.''
   On the industrial side, it predicted that three-fourths of the
193 manufacturing firms it reviewed should enjoy rising shipments
next year while 18 percent will suffer declines and the rest will
have stagnant shipments.
   It predicted a median growth rate in manufacturing shipments of
2 percent next year, after removing the effects of inflation. That
would compare with estimated growth of 2.2 percent this year and
2.5 percent in 1988.
   The department predicted that service industries, especially
those providing information and health care, would outperform the
manufacturing sector.
   Commerce Undersecretary J. Michael Farren, briefing reporters on
the forecast Thursday, said the United States is evolving steadily
into an ``information economy.''
   ``Industries involved in the collection, processing and
communication of information are among the fastest growing,'' he
said.
   For 1990, the government projected the fastest growth in
services would be in satellite communication and electronic
information services, both forecast to enjoy revenue gains of 20
percent next year.
   Computer software, data processing, management consulting,
medical services and the cable television industry all were
projected to have growth rates of 10 percent or higher.
   In manufacturing, the big winners in 1990 were expected to be
the makers of surgical and medical instruments, with a projected 10
percent rise in shipments, followed by makers of surgical supplies,
with shipments forecast to be up by 9 percent.
   The biggest loser in manufacturing was forecast to be makers of
household washers and dryers, where shipments were projected to
decline by 5 percent, followed by glass makers, facing a forecasted
4.9 percent drop in shipments.
   Both of those industries are tied closely to housing
construction, which is expected to be lackluster next year.
   Overall, construction was expected to show no gains as a modest
increase in housing construction will be offset by a decline in
non-residential construction, reflecting expected declines in
office and hotel construction, two sectors with high vacancy rates.
   Another key sector likely to perform poorly next year is autos.
Car sales were projected to drop another 1 percent to 9.9 million
units in 1990 following a 5 percent fall in 1989.
   Many of the industries that are not expected to do well in 1990
are closely tied to the auto or construction sectors, including
producers of construction materials, big-ticket household
appliances and steel.
   Steel shipments should drop by 4 percent in 1990, down to a
level of 78 million tons. While that would be the lowest level
since 1987, it still would be above the depressed sales recorded
from 1982 through 1986.
   Farren said that U.S. export sales, which have been one of the
economy's main supports over the past two years, will continue to
rise next year although the trade deficit will show only a small
improvement, in part because U.S. demand for imports remains high.
   Among the exporting industries expected to do the best are
aircraft makers, chemical producers and businesses catering to
foreign tourists.
   ``For the first time, receipts from foreigners traveling in the
United States will exceed expenditures by Americans traveling
abroad,'' Farren said, forecasting that the surplus in travel will
lower the U.S. trade deficit by about $1 billion next year.
   In 1989, shipments of civilian aircraft surpassed military
aircraft shipments for the first time since 1981 and the government
forecast that trend will continue. Based on record orders already
received, the department predicted approximately 512 deliveries of
commercial jetliners in 1990, more than three times the level of
commercial shipments just six years ago.
   Chemicals, the leading U.S. export industry, will see moderate
growth in 1990 with export sales topping $38 billion, enough to
generate a $16 billion surplus over the amount of chemical products
expected to be imported into the United States.

<HEAD>Farm Couple Indicted by Grand Jury in Five Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHILLICOTHE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly farm couple accused of
killing drifters in northwest Missouri to cover up a cattle-theft
scheme was indicted by a grand jury on five counts of murder.
   Ray and Faye Copeland had been charged previously by Livingston
County prosecutors with three counts of first-degree murder. The
indictment handed up Thursday includes those three victims and two
others.
   Officials said they sought indictments by the county grand jury
to avert a costly preliminary hearing. Cases considered by a grand
jury aren't taken to preliminary hearing, in which a judge
determines if the evidence is sufficient to send a case to trial.
   Prosecuting Attorney Doug Roberts said he expected the
Copelands, who are being held in the county jail, to stand trial in
the second half of 1990 at the earliest. Arraignment was scheduled
for Jan. 2.
   Authorities identified the fifth murder victim as the indictment
was filed. He was Wayne Warner, but his hometown and age weren't
immediately known.
   Ray Copeland, 75, and Faye Copeland, 68, have been held since
their arrest in October on charges they conspired to steal cattle.
Those charges have since been dropped.
   Each of the victims had been shot in the head, and the bodies
were found on farms where Ray Copeland had done odd jobs. Four of
the bodies were found in shallow graves and one was found weighted
down in a well.
   The Copelands were charged Oct. 9 with conspiracy to steal
cattle with bad checks from an account set up in August for an
employee.
   Prosecutors allege the couple used the men to write bad checks
in the cattle scheme, then killed them to keep them from talking.
   Prosecutors said previously they would seek the death penalty on
the first three murder charges, and state Attorney General William
Webster said that was still planned.
   Bail had been set at $500,000 each. With the indictment, that
was changed so the couple can't be freed on bail, Webster said in a
news release.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. effort to recruit aid for Panama's
damaged economy is targeting Japan, which has a strong vested
interest in the Panama Canal, a Japanese Embassy official says.
   The request, which went out in recent days, is part of a
government-wide mobilization to help Panama rebuild an economy
shattered by two years of U.S. sanctions against deposed dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega and by last week's invasion by U.S. troops.
   In talks both before and after the invasion, the United States
urged Japan to help Panama regain the economic standing it enjoyed
before Noriega's 1988 indictments in the United States on drug
trafficking charges. The indictments shook investors' confidence in
Panama.
   Japan ships many of its exports to the United States through the
Panama Canal and has provided more than $5 million in annual
technical aid to support the government's stability.
   ``The U.S. expects Japan to play a significant role,'' said a
Japanese Embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Japan stopped its aid to Panama six months ago but expects to
resume and increase the assistance once it recognizes the new
Panamanian government installed with U.S. support last week, said
the official.
   On Thursday, a U.S. State Department team arrived in Panama to
assess the country's immediate needs in providing shelter, food and
medicine to thousands of Panamanians left homeless by the operation
mounted Dec. 20 to remove Noriega from power.
   The team, led by the head of the Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance, Andrew Natsios, will remain in Panama until Monday.
   An estimated 570 people, including 23 American servicemen, were
killed in five days of fighting against Noriega loyalists,
officials report.
   Alfredo Maduro, president of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce,
said Thursday that insurance brokers estimate losses from looting
or other damage to businesses in the capital at $750 million to $1
billion.
   Maduro said businessmen planned to ask the United States for
``something like a Marshall Plan for Panama'' to recover.
   To address the country's longer term needs, a task force has
been formed with representatives from the Treasury, State and
Commerce departments. The group has held talks since Tuesday with a
three-man Panamanian delegation and will head for Panama next week
to examine the situation.
   The focus of the Panamanian-American meeting is the transfer of
some $400 million in Panamanian government money frozen last year
in the United States. President Bush last week ordered the funds
released, but the process is expected to take several weeks,
administration officials said.
   The United States already has transferred $5.82 million
confiscated from Noriega to the new government headed by Guillermo
Endara, a U.S. military spokesman in Panama City said Thursday.
   The Bush administration has not yet asked Congress for money for
Panama's rehabilitation, relying for now on the $400 million in
unfrozen Panamanian assets.
   But Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee of the House and Senate, said that sum would not be
enough.
   ``The Panama economy is in a mess, maybe in a bigger mess than I
think,'' Hamilton said at a news conference.
   Panama's needs must be identified and aid must be provided, he
said. ``You can't promote their democracy unless you help their
economy.''
   Panama, once a thriving banking center with a per capita income
double that of its neighbors, has seen its economy shrink at an
estimated annual rate of 10 percent to 15 percent since 1987,
according to economic analysts.
   Economic sanctions by the United States and a loss of confidence
in Noriega led U.S. firms, including large-scale employers like
Xerox and IBM, to scale down their businesses in Panama.
Unemployment has risen to more than 20 percent.
   In addition, Panama owes at least $5.6 billion to foreign banks,
governments and international lending agencies such as the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   The World Bank is not expected to resume any lending to Panama
unless the country repays some $180 million in arrears on past
loans, bank officials said.

   Eighty-year-old Edna Cooley has been waking up
at 3 a.m. for nearly 22 years to trudge outside in occasionally
bone-chilling cold and record the weather in the sparsely settled
high desert of central Nevada.
   Some 18{ hours later, Mrs. Cooley makes the last of her six
daily weather observations and temperature checks for National
Weather Service records on Austin, population 350, earning $11.10 a
day for her troubles.
   ``Why do I keep doing it? They say you can even get used to
hanging if you hang long enough,'' Mrs. Cooley said. ``I've been
meaning to quit for two years, but can't find anyone else to do
this.''
   She is among the last of a breed of hands-on recorders of the
nation's highs, lows and precipitation amounts. Without the
observers, meteorologists and forecasters would have a more
difficult time predicting the weather.
   ``There's a need for live observation,'' said Gerald Miles, a
meterologist in Elko who supervises the weather watchers.
``Equipment is reliable, but you need good remarks from observers
to go with it. Equipment has its limitations.''
   Bill Davis, the Salt Lake City-based western regional director
of the observation program, said about 50 weather watchers are on
the National Weather Service payroll in his jurisdication.
   Several hundred others, mostly farmers, voluntarily report
climate information to the agency to help keep a historical weather
record.
   Davis said at-home weather observation stations were set up
during World War II ``basically wherever they could find someone
and where we didn't have a government office.'' Meteorology was
rapidly developing, and officials found ``eyeball-type''
information improved their ability to track storms, he said.
   The observers must pass a certification test and use weather
service equipment to take measurements of temperature, winds, dew
point, atmospheric pressure and precipitation. The routine can take
10 to 15 minutes, depending on the weather.
   ``There's no grand plan to get rid of the weather observers,''
Davis said. ``I think they'll be around for the next decade. But
we'll lose some to equipment and because people will retire and the
younger generation doesn't want to work that hard for so little
money.''
   Mrs. Cooley said that when she goes on vacation, ``there's no
weather coming out of Austin. The TV stations just say, `Oh well, I
guess that Edna's out of town again.'''
   Debi Gill, who usually reports Nevada's coldest overnight lows
at Wildhorse Reservoir just south of the Idaho border, has been an
observer for 3{ years.
   ``Sometimes, I wonder why I keep doing it, especially at 5:30 in
the morning,'' she said.
   Mrs. Gill, like other weather observers, gets $2.50 for the
first early morning recording, $1.60 for daytime readings and $1.90
for each night observation.
   She said the most frightening thing about the job is the
late-night readings when near silence fuels the imagination, she
said.
   ``When the lake is frozen over the ice groans and the coyotes
are yipping and howling, I just get all nervous,'' said Mrs. Gill.
``It's silly, but I get scared of the bogyman because that's the
only one who would be out that time of night.''
   The good part of the job is closely watching how nature works
and stopping to enjoy the surrounding weather, sunrises and
sunsets, she said.
   ``Not many people stop and watch the sky,'' she said. ``The
clouds actually grow, puff up right before your eyes. It's
wonderful.''
   Observers must distinguish among three layers of clouds with
nine different basic cloud types possible at each level.
   Susan Deming, who has been observing the weather in Battle
Mountain in north-central Nevada since May, said people sometimes
stop her on the street or telephone her asking what the weather
will be like or with weather-related inquiries, such as whether it
is too soon to plant.
   ``I have to tell them I don't predict the weather; I just
observe it,'' she said.

   The Metropolitan Opera's light-hearted
production of Johann Strauss' ``Die Fledermaus'' was especially
effervescent in its second appearance this season.
   On Thursday, German baritone Hermann Prey, respected for
bringing importance to weighty music, cavorted merrily and seemed
to be having as good a time on stage as though really at Prince
Orlofsky's Act 2 party. It was Prey's first time to sing Eisenstein
at the Met.
   In the speaking role of Frosch, the jailer, the Met has had, in
recent memory, Jack Gilford, Otto Schenk, who devised this
production in 1986, and Sid Caesar. On Christmas night, in this
season's first ``Die Fledermaus,'' actor-comedian Dom DeLuise made
his Met debut.
   At the Met, singing is in German and speaking _ thus, most of
the jokes _ are in English.
   DeLuise's timing and body language were wonderful.
Traditionally, some of the jokes are changed each season. DeLuise
held a beer bottle which crumbled in his hand when he sang a couple
of high notes.
   And, he told a series of Leona Helmsley one-liners, concluding,
``She thinks she owns the place.''
   DeLuise's exchanges with the excellent Franz Mazura as the
jail's warden were genuinely funny.
   Carol Vaness sang Rosalinde, who gets the best of her husband
Eisenstein in an elaborate practical joke set up by his friend
Falke, well sung by Lenus Carlson. Miss Vaness also handled the
flamboyance well when she pretended to be a Hungarian countess.
   Neil Shicoff sang a tenor who adores Rosalinde, throwing himself
into the fun wholeheartedly. Barbara Kilduff sang sweetly as Adele
the maid and Grace Millo sparkled as her pert sister.
   Brigitte Fassbaender sang Prince Orlofsky for the first time at
the Met. She dressed simply for the part, red sash across a tuxedo.
The distinctive edge on her speaking voice turned shrill on her
sung high notes. But Miss Fassbaender commands a stage easily and
is an agreeable, distinctive Orlofsky.
   Hermann Michael, who has been Herbert von Karajan's assistant at
the Vienna State Opera and has conducted Wagner operas in Seattle,
made his Met debut on Christmas day. His timing was unrushed and
fine and the orchestra sounded very lyrical under his baton.
   Act 2 remains among the Met's most delightful sets, as the
outside of Prince Orlofsky's glass conservatory room moves on the
Met turntable until it becomes the room's interior, ready for
dinner and lively dancing to Strauss.

   Penthouse magazine has broken weeks of silence
by announcing publication of an ``intimate'' interview with Stephen
Gobie, the prostitute who had a relationship with Rep. Barney Frank.
   The March 1990 issue will hit the newsstands the first week of
February, according to magazine spokeswoman Leslie Jay.
   Frank, D-Mass., who is under investigation by the House ethics
committee for his involvement with Gobie, promptly dubbed the
Penthouse announcement Thursday ``a non-story.''
   ``My guess is the only problem (Penthouse) is going to have is
whether to classify it as fiction or non-fiction,'' Frank said.
   Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, in a one-paragraph
announcement, said the interview would detail ``the subterranean
gay scene in the nation's capital, and its hottest players.''
   ``This is the most intimate interview ever published concerning
a sitting member of Congress,'' Guccione said.
   Gobie was paid a reported $50,000 to tell his story to Penthouse.
   In a news conference earlier this week, Frank dismissed the
potential explosiveness of the Penthouse article. He said it was
``nonsense'' to believe recent reports that the ethics committee
was delaying its investigation until it can review the Penthouse
article.
   Ethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., also rejected
such claims, noting that any information Penthouse could obtain the
committee also could get simply by issuing a subpoena.
   Gobie already has testified before the ethics committee. Frank
has not yet appeared before the committee _ which holds all its
hearings behind closed doors _ and has not said whether he has been
invited to testify.
   Frank said he is anxious for the opportunity to show the
committee that Gobie's charges are untrue.
   Gobie has an unlisted phone number in the Washington area and
could not be reached Thursday for comment.
   The ethics committee investigation began with Frank publicly
acknowledging late last summer that he had paid Gobie $80 for sex
in 1985, hired him with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper
and driver from July 1985 through August 1987 and intervened with
Virginia probation authorities on Gobie's behalf.
   But Frank has denied other allegations by Gobie, including
charges that Frank knew Gobie was running a prostitution ring from
Frank's apartment on Capitol Hill and that the two had engaged in
sex in the House gymnasium.

<HEAD>New Census Figures Could Affect Reapportionment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census Bureau figures released today indicate
that seven states are likely to gain seats in the U.S. House of
Representatives in reapportionment, while as many as a dozen states
will lose at least one seat, forecasters say.
   The next reapportionment will be based on the final 1990 Census
figures, which will be collected in the 10-year census next year.
The state population figures released today go up to mid-1989 and
represent one last checkpoint before the final, official count.
   The non-profit Population Reference Bureau said that if the
trends in this latest report hold true through the final 1990
figures, California will gain seven seats, Texas and Florida each
will gain three, and Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona
will gain one apiece.
   At the same time, 11 states are likely to lose one or more
seats, the Population Reference Bureau said. It said New York will
lose three seats, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois each
will lose two, and New Jersey, Massachusetts, Iowa, Kansas, West
Virginia and Montana each will lose one.
   Comparable predictions by Election Data Services Inc., a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed little. The
firm, however, added Kentucky to the list of losers, dropping one
congressional seat, and predicted that Florida will gain four
seats, rather than three.
   However, the Census Bureau figures on which the predictions are
based do not include members of the military and their dependents
living overseas. They will be counted in the 1990 reapportionment,
the government recently announced, and that change could mean the
difference in whether some states gain or lose a seat.
   The Census figures show that the populations of five states grew
at rates faster than 10 percent from 1985 to mid-1989.
   The state that experienced the largest percentage increase in
population between 1985 and mid-1989, Nevada, grew by 18 percent.
Second was Arizona, 12 percent, followed by Florida and New
Hampshire at 11 percent and California at 10 percent.
   At the same time, seven states lost population, the bureau said:
Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming, Louisiana and
Oklahoma.

   An 800-foot-long holiday card is on its way to
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, bearing season's greetings
serious and light from half a million Americans.
   ``One world, one people,'' Yoko Ono wrote on one of the
100-foot-long, 12-foot-wide rolls of paper that James Lawlor, 34,
of Iowa, has carried around the country since May.
   ``Hey dude, hang tough. Your bud _ Dennis,'' someone in Seattle
offered.
   ``Hey Gorby, let's do lunch,'' wrote someone in San Diego.
   Lawlor said he got the idea a year ago, and put his
safety-goggle business in Iowa on hold to travel to all 50 states.
He collected signatures on enough paper to cover the side of an
80-story building one block wide, financing the $125,000 cost
through T-shirt sales and donations.
   He said he wanted to give Gorbachev a boost.
   ``I felt the man needed encouragement,'' Lawlor said. ``I liked
the changes he was making.''
   To get the card noticed, he chose ``to make it huge and have
everybody in America sign it.''
   With help from the Soviet Embassy and the national airline,
Aeroflot, the card will be flown today to Moscow and will be
displayed near the Kremlin so Soviet citizens can read it. Lawlor
and an assistant will go along.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo has named a task force to
help New York companies learn to make butter instead of guns.
   Cuomo created the task force Thursday to help New York companies
that lose defense contracts ``make a successful transition into
commercial production.''
   Noting that ``defense spending is a $20 billion industry in New
York state,'' Cuomo said the state had to be ready for change,
given Defense Secretary Richard Cheney's plan to cut military
spending.
   Cheney is considering cuts in the armed forces and cancellation
of weapons programs as part of an effort to reduce the defense
budget. Last month, Cheney directed the services to come up with
from $140 billion to $180 billion in cuts from the fiscal 1992 to
1994 military budgets.
   Cuomo said the task force would be headed by Vincent Tese, the
state's economic development director, and Brad Johnson, the
governor's Washington lobbyist.
   At the same time, the Democratic governor warned that the nation
must maintain its ability to produce weapons.
   ``If events in the Soviet Union or in Eastern Europe were to
take a dramatically different turn, we must be able to respond,''
he said. ``I am concerned about the erosion of our industrial base
in this country at a time when the Pentagon is awarding $10 billion
in contracts to overseas bidders.''

<TEXT>
   A racial issue was raised in closing
arguments in a suit accusing Paramount Pictures of plagiarizing Art
Buchwald's idea for a story about an African prince for the Eddie
Murphy movie, ``Coming to America.''
   Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider took the lawsuit under
submission Thursday after arguments by Buchwald's lawyer and an
attorney for Paramount Pictures.
   Schneider said he would issue a written ruling ``relatively
soon.'' Attorneys said that could mean within three to 15 days.
   Paramount lawyer Robert Draper drew a mild rebuke from the judge
when he tried to inject a racial issue into the lawsuit.
   ``Eddie Murphy is black and Eddie Murphy is a mega-star, and
Eddie Murphy has to make a living,'' attorney Robert Draper began.
``He's not white like Mr. Buchwald. He's not an Eastern
establishment writer like Mr. Buchwald.''
   At that point, Schneider interrupted the attorney's closing
argument.
   ``I don't perceive this to be a case about race,'' the judge
said.
   ``I disagree with your honor,'' said Draper. But he dropped the
subject and moved on to argue there aren't sufficient similarities
between Buchwald's script idea, ``King for a Day,'' and Murphy's
box office hit, ``Coming to America'' to show that one was based on
the other.
   Attorney Pierce O'Donnell, representing Buchwald, argued there
are at least 14 points and perhaps as many as 35 points of
similarity between the scripts. Both involve an African member of
royalty coming to the United States, living in a ghetto, working at
a fast food restaurant, falling in love and taking home a bride.
   O'Donnell cited Paramount's 1983 contract with Buchwald to
produce his brief treatment entitled, ``King for a Day,'' and said
it was clearly the inspiration for Murphy's film. Buchwald is
seeking $5 million in actual damages and unspecified punitive
damages from the studio.
   ``Hollywood makes movies, but not without ideas,'' O'Donnell
declared. ``At minimum, what Paramount bought was an idea, a
concept. It was unique. It was original ... as it turned out, this
was a $400 million idea.''
   Schneider pressed both lawyers to tell him what elements would
combine to prove that a movie was based upon another script or
idea. He called the issue amorphous and said the evidence had
failed to clarify it.

<HEAD>Hawaii Aims to Prevent Child Abuse With Early Intervention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE ELLIOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaii is trying to fight child abuse with an
ambitious program designed to screen every new parent for the
potential to commit domestic violence and offer counseling to those
at risk.
   The Healthy Start program presently reaches 60 percent of
Hawaii's new parents, and the state hopes to be screening nearly
every new parent by 1992. Those judged at risk are offered five
years of home visits and counseling on economic and emotional
problems that can lead to child abuse.
   ``What's nice about the program is they're trying to help the
family in all aspects of family life,'' said Loretta Fuddy,
supervisor of child services for the state Health Department's
maternal child health branch. The department supervises seven
private agencies that operate the program.
   Twenty percent of those surveyed are found to be at risk and are
offered the services of a home worker who makes weekly visits, said
Betsy Uohara Pratt of Hawaii Family Stress Center, which began a
pilot program in 1985 from which Healthy Start was developed. Only
5 percent of the parents decline the assistance, she said.
   Roughly 1,500 to 1,600 households have received home visits this
year. That number is expected to increase to 2,600 by 1992. The
program is expected to cost $6 million a year when fully operating.
   There were 2,215 documented cases of child abuse in Hawaii in
1988, according to the state Health Department.
   Pratt said it is difficult to locate abused children before they
reach school age.
   ``I've seen a lot of kindergarteners absolutely devastated by
the time they reach kindergarten,'' said Pratt, who supervises the
training of counselors for Healthy Start. ``We can help these kids
get off to a safe and healthy start which would help them when they
get into the school system.''
   Healthy Start begins at the hospital shortly after a baby is
born. Workers interview new parents or examine their medical charts
to spot warning signs that indicate a tendency to abuse or neglect
children.
   Workers try to determine whether the parent or parents have
financial problems, housing problems, low self-esteem, were abused
as children, or have other traits considered warning signs for
child abuse.
   About 75 percent of those helped by Healthy Start are mothers on
welfare, Pratt said.
   The home worker counsels on basic parenting skills that help a
child's development and alleviate stress on a parent. ``Many
families have astoundingly little knowledge of infants,'' she said.
   Workers also help the families attack economic and emotional
problems by putting them in touch with social service agencies.
   Most important, Pratt said, the workers help build the parents'
self-esteem.
   ``What we do for them is cheer them on,'' she said.
   Visits are made once a week until a baby is 18 months and then
are gradually scaled back to quarterly visits until the child is 5
years old.
   Fuddy said the program costs the state $1,600 a year per family.
In comparison, she said, it costs $6,000 to provide a year of
foster care for a child.
   She said she hasn't heard anyone objecting that Healthy Start
might be an invasion of privacy.
   ``It's offered as a service to the families,'' she said. ``They
ask permission to interview the families and offer them home
visitor services.''
   She said assessment workers have permission from hospitals to
screen patients' records. The patients' permission isn't required,
she said.
   Pratt said it's too early to say if Healthy Start has had an
impact on Hawaii's rate of child abuse.
   ``We can only guess that it's helping,'' she said.

<HEAD>Turner Sues for CNN Broadcasts to Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System is suing the Bush
administration in an effort to gain permission to provide its Cable
News Network to Vietnam, a Turner official says.
   The Atlanta-based broadcasting company wants to provide a
satellite receiving station to the Vietnamese at no charge and give
them the right to take the CNN signal for 50 Vietnamese dong a
year, worth less than a penny, Bertram Carp, a Turner vice
president in Washington said Thursday.
   U.S. law prohibits most trade with Vietnam. Turner said in its
lawsuit filed U.S. District Court in Washington on Wednesday that
CNN would qualify under a 1988 amendment to trade law that exempts
information materials from trade sanctions.
   Turner believes that under the amendment, ``we're entitled to
this,'' said Carp.
   The administration interprets the law to mean that physical
materials such as books or videocassettes may be exchanged with
Vietnam, but not ``immaterial'' commodities, including TV
broadcasts.
   Vietnam now provides videocassettes for CNN's ``World Report''
program, Carp said.
   Carp said the suit, filed Wednesday, asks the court to order the
Treasury Department's office of foreign assets control to allow CNN
to provide the receiving station and signal to Vietnam.
   Carp said the Commerce Department would have to approve sending
the Earth station.

   SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories Inc.
has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a federal investigation of
alleged kickbacks for physicians who referred Medicare and Medicaid
business to the company, the government says.
   The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general
found that more than 100 physicians were investors in three
California laboratories managed by the company.
   The inspector general's office said the arrangement under which
doctors were recruited as investors and lab profits were
distributed to those same doctors violated a federal law
prohibiting payments intended to induce referrals of Medicaid and
Medicare patients.
   The $1.5 million settlement was the largest ever made under the
law, the inspector general's office said.
   SmithKline spokeswoman Tobey Dichter said Thursday that the
settlement ``is an agreement that was reached to avoid costly
litigation and disruption to our business.
   ``It is not an admission of liability in any way,'' she said.
   The inspector general proposed the three laboratories be barred
permanently from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, Social
Security and California health care programs and that some
individuals and companies linked to the labs be barred for several
years.

   The Justice Department says it obtained guilty
pleas or convictions in a record 107 environmental criminal cases
in the last fiscal year.
   The number reflects a 70 percent increase over the previous year
and demonstrates the Bush administration's commitment to
environmental protection, says Richard Stewart, assistant attorney
general for the land and natural resources division.
   But department officials acknowledged Thursday that many of the
107 cases concluded during the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30
and cited in Wednesday's announcement may have been initiated
before President Bush took office last January.
   The number of indictments alleging environmental crimes actually
declined in fiscal 1989 by about 20 percent to 101, the lowest
number in three years, compared with 124 in 1988 and 127 in 1987.
   Spokeswoman Amy Casner acknowledged that the sharp increase in
the number of cases won in fiscal 1989 reflected in part the high
number of indictments filed in previous years.
   The 107 cases resulted in the collection of $12.7 million in
fines.

   The National Safety Council estimates as many as
350 people may be killed in traffic accidents over the four-day New
Year's holiday, which begins this evening.
   In addition, the Chicago-based council predicts that some 12,000
to 16,000 people may suffer disabling injuries in accidents on the
nation's streets and highways.
   The council bases its estimates on data from previous years,
seasonal weather conditions and national driving safety trends. It
says 317 people died in car accidents during the New Year's holiday
weekend last year.
   The official counting period begins at 6 p.m. EST today and runs
though 11:59 p.m. Monday, closing at midnight in each time zone.
   Over this year's four-day Christmas holiday, 353 people died _
fewer than the 386 traffic fatalities reported in 1988. The safety
council had estimated that between 320 and 420 people would die
this year.
   The council said that alcohol _ a factor in more than half of
all traffic fatalities _ poses a particular threat during the New
Year's weekend, when many people attend holiday parties.

<TEXT>
   About 800 people, including political leaders,
gaming executives and weathered cowboys in 10-gallon hats, turned
out for an emotional funeral service for Las Vegas casino pioneer
Benny Binion.
   ``I never met anybody that met Benny Binion who didn't like him
in two minutes,'' close friend Steve Wynn said at Thursday's
service. ``I never met anybody that met Benny Binion that didn't
respect him in five minutes. He was the most extraordinary man I
ever met.''
   Binion, owner of Horseshoe Casino, died Christmas Day of a
heart-related condition. He was 85.
   A funeral procession stretched several blocks from the suburban
Roman Catholic church Binion helped build to a cemetery where he
was buried, just blocks from his downtown casino.
   Wynn, chairman of the Mirage hotel on the Las Vegas Strip and
the Golden Nugget across downtown's Glitter Gulch from Binion's
Horseshoe Casino, nodded toward Binion's casket, topped by the
gambler's trademark cowboy hat.
   ``We're going to see a lot more cowboy hats and cowboy boots in
this town. But I don''t think anybody is going to see the likes of
Benny Binion again,'' he said.
   The Rev. Bill Kenny of Christ the King Church praised Binion as
a man who was ``like a grizzly bear outside but inside like a
lamb.''
   Binion's death further thinned the ranks of the flamboyant
old-time gamblers who built Las Vegas from a wide spot on a desert
road to the nation's gambling Mecca, only to see their casinos
taken over in recent years by major corporations.
   He was born in Grayson County, Texas, to a family that sold race
horses on the county fair circuit, a connection that provided his
entry into the gambling world. He started by running illegal craps
games, usually out of hotel rooms.
   Binion moved to Las Vegas in 1946 and bought the Horseshoe
casino five years later, quickly building it into one of the city's
premiere attractions.
   The Horseshoe Club, noted for its million-dollar craps table
bets, its annual $10,000 buy-in World Series of Poker tournament
and its $1 million collection of $10,000 bills, now occupies a city
block.

   Neighbors of Manuel Antonio Noriega's
former military headquarters say he can turn himself into a snake
or a bird, so they warn U.S. troops ringing the Vatican embassy to
keep a close watch.
   Noriega's mystique as a ``brujo,'' or warlock, survives even
though he was toppled by U.S. invaders and remained holed up in the
embassy. Noriega practiced santeria, a cult that mixes African,
Roman Catholic and American Indian deities and sometimes involves
animal sacrifice.
   ``That man is the devil,'' said a young woman in the poor
neighborhood of El Chorrillo, a few blocks from the ruins of
Noriega's Comandancia headquarters.
   ``They better watch him. I don't want him to escape. He can turn
himself into a boa or a dove and escape from the gringos,'' she
said.
   The woman spoke as she stood in a line for food handouts. Other
housewives nodded earnestly at her remark.
   It had been said that Noriega felt secure having the Comandancia
in El Chorrillo because he believed Panama's poor solidly supported
his nationalism.
   But the women interviewed Thursday disputed that belief and said
they would not feel safe while Noriega remained out of U.S. hands.
   ``We didn't want his dictatorship anymore because he was
bringing in communism,'' said one woman. ``Any Panamanian who did
not agree with him, he would kick them out of their jobs and throw
them in jail. He only had a bunch of thugs working for him.''
   The women refused to give their names as they awaited food bags
distributed by the U.S. military that included rice, cooking oil,
sugar, infant formula and canned goods.
   The U.S. attack on the Comandancia destroyed several blocks of
Chorrillo, but many in line said they did not feel bitter.
   ``The gringos are helping us,'' said one housewife. ``There's
few grocery stores that are open. The Dignity Batallions stole
everything,'' she said in reference to a paramilitary group of
Noriega loyalists.
   The women said they did not want Noriega handed over to the new
Panamanian government. The former strongman sought refuge at the
Vatican embassy on Sunday.
   ``They'll treat him too soft,'' said one. ``There's lots of
Noriega's friends who now are hurrying up to get in the good graces
of the new government. But just wait until the gringos leave. It
could start again.''
   Another said the best solution would to turn Noriega over to the
United States to be tried on drug-trafficking charges.
   ``I don't want that beast in Panama,'' she said. ``We forgive
him, but let the gringos take him away all the same. I'll feel safe
the day I hear he's out of Panama.''
   As a reporter departed, one woman ran up and asked: ``Can you
take this to President Bush?''
   Inside a folder was a handwritten letter on white paper thanking
Bush for the invasion. The letter, dated Dec. 26, had been signed
by 31 people, mostly women from El Chorrillo.
   ``Hallellujah,'' the letter said. ``The communists of Panama and
the internationalists preach the self-determination of the people,
(but) they don't respect it. But (for) the self-determination of
the people of Panama (we) give you thanks for liberating us.''

<TEXT>
   The music syndicate BMI is suing Home Box Office
to bar the cable company from broadcasting BMI-copyrighted songs,
which are used in a number of movies HBO has scheduled to run.
   In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan Thursday,
BMI asked that HBO be barred from transmitting the songs after
Sunday, when the companies' licensing agreement ends.
   Judge Vincent Broderick declined to issue an immediate bar,
scheduling fuller arguments before another judge, Pierre Leval, on
Tuesday.
   BMI, or Broadcast Music Inc., represents more than 100,000
composers and publishers of more than 1.5 million songs, collecting
a contracted fee whenever one of its songs is played. It licenses
radio and television stations, hotel and restaurant chains, even
discotheques.
   The suit comes amid efforts by BMI to boost its cable television
levies. Beyond raising basic rates, BMI wants to collect from local
cable systems as well as from cable programmers. It now charges
programmers alone.
   The suit said negotiations between BMI and HBO on a new contract
had been fruitless. Ahrold declined to say what HBO currently pays
BMI or how much more BMI wants.
   The suit listed 11 films in HBO's January schedule that include
BMI songs, including the Beatles' ``Helter Skelter'' in the movie
``U2 Rattle and Hum,'' the song ``Strangers in the Night'' in
``Fright Night'' and George Thorogood's ``Bad to the Bone,'' heard
in ``Talk Radio.''
   BMI has sued several other cable television programmers alleging
copyright infringement this year, but Thursday's suit was its first
seeking to prevent transmissions in advance, said BMI spokesman
Robbin Ahrold.
   BMI President Frances W. Preston said its rates for cable
television have been discounted while the industry developed, but
``must now be brought into line with the full value of the use of
the BMI repertoire.''
   Moreover, under BMI's reading of copyright law, ``License fees
must be paid by both the programmer and the local system operator,
each of whom receives revenues for the use of BMI's repertoire,''
she said.
   Ahrold likened the concept to a hotel piping radio music into
its halls: Both the radio station and the hotel must pay BMI, he
said.
   HBO, owned by Time-Warner Inc., has more than 23 million
subscribers, making it the largest pay-television service in the
nation, according to BMI's suit. HBO spokesman Jim Noonan said he
had not seen the suit and could not comment on it, but he said HBO
still was negotiating with BMI on a new contract.

<HEAD>Heating Oil Prices are Causing Problems For the Poor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The coldest December weather in New England in a
century is hitting people least able to withstand the blow _ people
on fixed incomes and those receiving a specified amount of fuel
assistance.
   But amid rising concern among the poor and increasing calls for
investigations by elected officials, there were signs Thursday that
the price of home heating oil may drop as rapidly as it rose.
   The U.S. Department of Energy reported record volumes of heating
oil flowing toward the Northeast. The department also granted the
first of what it expects to be several waivers allowing foreign
ships to carry oil from one U.S. port to another. Existing law
restricts such shipments to U.S.-owned vessels.
   People around the region say help can't come fast enough.
   ``I have one patient who must have oxygen. This week, she turned
it off to save money for fuel,'' said Jeanne Steenbeke, a visiting
nurse in the Concord, N.H., area. ``That's kind of scary.''
   ``Elderly people have every penny of their Social Security money
allotted,'' she said. ``There's X amount of dollars for rent, for
food and for utilities.''
   Topsy Corcoran, 82, a widow on a fixed income, paid $1.46 a
gallon to fill her heating oil tank Wednesday in Concord, N.H. On
Thursday, she would have paid $1.52. The last time she filled the
tank, it cost almost $100; this time it was $150.
   ``I've got to pay for it. What am I going to do?'' she said.
   The Massachusetts fuel assistance program already has received
17,000 applications for aid this year, about 4,000 more than it
received any previous year, said Ed McCauley, program director.
   McCauley said some 643 households on aid have already run out of
their allotted funds for the winter because of the high price of
heating oil.
   ``Those people are in trouble right now,'' he said.
   Federal Energy Department spokesman Thomas Olson reported two
price drops on the wholesale oil market Thursday. The January price
for home heating oil _ the price that wholesalers will pay for
future deliveries _ dropped 3 cents per gallon, according to Olson.
And the price on the ``prompt'' market in New York Harbor _ the
price being paid for oil at the wharf _ dropped 12 cents per gallon.
   ``It will take a few more days to see if there's a real trend
here,'' Olson said.
   Added Bernard Smith of the New England Fuel Institute, a group
that represents fuel delivery companies, ``What goes up will come
down. It will probably come down so fast people will hear it.''
   Several members of Congress, including U.S. Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., and Reps. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., and Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., on Thursday joined the chorus
of officials calling on energy Secretary James D. Watkins to
investigate the price increases for the possibility of price
fixing. But Olson said the department lacks authority over prices
and that the attorney general's office would have to conduct such
an inquiry.
   These developments in Washington did little to alleviate the
immediate crisis in the cold-bound Northeast.
   Gary Groleau, energy coordinator for New Hampshire's fuel
assistance program, said 1,200 more people have applied for
assistance this year than last.
   Boston's City Hall energy hotline reported record numbers of
poor people calling because they've used their fuel assistance
allotment already.
   Jean Fleischman of the Boston-based Citizens Energy Corp., a
private foundation that supplies affordable heating oil to the
poor, related a tale of winter misery.
   ``I had an elderly woman yesterday, a widow from East Boston;
she ran out of oil and her house was cold,'' Ms. Fleischman said.
``She was crying.''

   The bent old woman, head scarved and
feet clad in clumsy felt slippers against the cold, smiled
toothlessly as she surveyed the ragtag relief convoy of cars, vans
and taxis loaded with supplies.
   ``There is an old Romanian saying: `First servings for everyone
else, last dregs for the Romanians,' she exclaimed. ``Now that the
devil is dead, maybe that will change.''
   Toppled and executed, President Nicolae Ceausescu remains
``Dracul'' _ the Devil _ to many who suffered under his hard hand
for 24 years.
   As the army tries to crush die-hard units of his special police,
humanitarian aid is pouring in from abroad.
   Scores of hastily organized convoys with Hungarians, Germans,
Americans, Brits and Belgians behind the wheel have braved poor
roads and the threat of ambush to help, assembling in neighboring
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Hungary and then heading for the border.
   Several aid volunteers have been reported killed or wounded by
Ceausescu's henchmen.
   Hungarian radio said Thursday that close to 1,000 trucks and
countless autos made the dangerous trek from Hungary alone since
Dec. 22.
   Typical was a 16-vehicle convoy assembled early one morning by
the Free Democratic Party of Hungary.
   Some highlights of its 16-hour voyage betweeen Budapest, the
Hungarian capital, and Timisoara, Romania, 300 miles to the
southeast:
   _ Budapest, 2:12 a.m. Wednesday. As the convoy forms, Jozsef
Kovacs, who helped put together the shipment of food, clothing and
medicine, relates the case of a driver in another convoy, shot in
Timisoara by a member of Ceausescu's Securitate police posing as a
hospital worker. Faces turn glum and one volunteer begs off.
   _ Varsand, Romania, 9:20 a.m. Processing of entry papers comes
to a halt as border guards and other Romanians crowd to watch the
videotaped trial of Ceausescu and his wife, Elena. As the
71-year-old dictator grimaces, a woman in a fur hat hisses: ``Ah,
the devil.'' Others laugh and nudge each other.
   _ Varsand, 11:30 a.m. A grinning man hoists a hand in a victory
sign. Hundreds of others follow suit along the route, including
children, old women and peasants on horse-drawn carriages. ``God
has sent you!,'' yells one woman. ``Victory!,'' cries another.
   _ On the road to Zindanu Nou, 11:40 a.m. Two smiling soldiers
armed with machine guns loom from the white fog _ the first of
numerous road checks. A three-mile line of cars waits for service
at two gas pumps, but there are smiles and waves to the passing
caravan with Red Cross emblems displayed on car hoods and
fluttering from antennae.
   _ Zindanu Nou, 12:30 p.m. Not everyone is happy in the village.
A neighbor of the old woman with the toothless grin waves down one
of the cars in the caravan and pleads for bandages, sobbing that
her husband, a recent amputee, has been dismissed from hospital for
lack of space.
   _ Arad, 1:07 p.m. A man drops his bicycle to blow kisses as the
convoy enters the city, the site of heavy fighting just days
before. Romanian flags, their Communist emblems cut from the
middle, flutter from hundreds of buildings. While some volunteers
help unload medical supplies, others visit a post-surgical ward.
   _ Ortisoara, 1:57 p.m. A boy no more than 7 years old, a toy
machine gun slung over his shoulder, waves a Romanian flag and
makes the V sign as the convoy moves by.
   _ Timisoara, 2:12 p.m. Much of the convoy's goods have
disappeared inside a main depot at the city's Central Hospital, but
some non-medical supplies _ bread, tinned goods, powdered soup _
are spread out on the front lawn for the taking. Several young
soldiers, rifles slung, are busy helping themselves.
   John Haydok, a Hungarian who now lives in Yonkers, N.Y., is
tired but happy. The 42-year-old man temporarily shut his land
developing business to help here.
   ``This is my first convoy,'' he says, beaming and wiping his
brow. ``I'm sure it won't be my last.''

   The news media shuttered by the
regime of Manuel Antonio Noriega are rushing to resume operations
just days after the general's overthrow by U.S. forces.
   Even employees of those media that loyally followed a
pro-government line under Noriega are celebrating the installation
of the civilian government of President Guillermo Endara.
   The Noriega closed three opposition newspapers, three radio
stations and a television channel in 1988, shortly after the United
States began demanding the general's ouster. His regime
expropriated another TV station this year.
   In some cases, broadcast or publishing licenses were revoked,
equipment confiscated and offending reporters hounded into exile.
   The new government announced Thursday that all news media can
resume operations without any restrictions.
   ``The government's basic line is to grant an opening for all
communications media, without regard to ownership, and freedom of
expression without any type of censorship,'' said Edwin Cabrera,
director of the government's communications office.
   Cabrera also said the government is dismissing all court
proceedings against journalists accused of violating censorship or
security regulations under Noriega.
   The change in government has unleashed a wave of pent-up
resentment against the former strongman, now holded up at the
Vatican embassy.
   Only 10 days ago, a newspaper reader could scan such headlines
as ``Our Country Will Not Kneel Before Anyone, Much Less the United
States,'' and ``Gringo Soldiers Shoot 1-Year-Old Girl.''
   The newspapers Critica, Matutino and La Republica all published
anti-American appeals on Dec. 19, the day before the U.S. invasion.
Radio Nacional continued pro-Noriega broadcasts up to the moment
its transmitters were destroyed by American troops last week.
   This week, an editorial broadcast by radio station KW
Continental, which had been closed under Noriega, declared, ``The
beast must not escape'' _ a reference to Noriega's refuge inside
the Vatican embassy.
   Now, many publishers, broadcasters and editors are returning to
work.
   The newspaper La Prensa, whose offices were ransacked almost two
years ago by pro-Noriega thugs, announced it plans to hit the
streets within two weeks.
   Editors estimated damages to La Prensa's facilities during the
raid at $2 million.

   Three people flagged down a cab, forced
the driver out and drove off, but at least they paid the fare.
   Ken Sharp said that when police returned his cab to him
Thursday, the hijackers had left $96 in the door pocket, including
his change money and ``the 20 pound ($32) fare I'd asked for when
they first got in.''
   The 33-year-old man's cab was hijacked Wednesday and left by the
side of the road near Torquay, 150 miles southwest of London.
Police on Thursday returned the taxi, found 25 miles away in
Plymouth.
   ``Finding the money was surprising,'' said a police spokesman.
``It must be the Christmas spirit.''

<HEAD>Eagle Nest Raises Questions About Plant Location</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discovery of an eagle's nest apparently
has complicated plans to build a $75 million hazardous waste
treatment plant.
   A state game warden found a pair of the birds nearly finished
building their nest this week in a tall pine on an 86-acre site in
central Florida where Florida First Processing Inc. wants to build
the plant.
   Bald eagles and their habitat are protected by federal and state
laws, said Don Palmer, a biologist in the Jacksonville office of
the federal Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The eagles were greeted with cheers from some of the 15 families
who live a half mile from the site 10 miles south of Mulberry and
bitterly oppose the plant.
   ``It's an answer to our prayers,'' said spokeswoman Sandra
Lancaster.
   Because federal and state laws prohibit relocating or disturbing
the endangered birds, the plant's developers could be barred from
building, according to federal and state wildlife authorities.
   ``Obviously we have to talk with the Fish and Wildlife bureau to
learn more about this,'' said Florida First vice president Ted
Leigh, who was unaware of the nesting eagles until Wednesday.
   Federal and state guidelines say development is prohibited
within a minimum of a 750-foot radius, or about 40 acres, of a
nest, Palmer said. Outside that, development up to a mile radius of
the nest can be restricted by federal officials.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas marked the 10th
anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan with one of the
year's heaviest rocket attacks on their nation's capital, news
reports said.
   There were conflicting accounts of casualties.
   Newspapers in Pakistan cited dispatches Thursday from Kabul, the
Afghan capital, with officials saying ``dozens'' were believed
killed when about 52 rockets hit the airport and residential areas
on Wednesday.
   Radio Kabul, run by Afghanistan's Marxist government, reported
18 people wounded but none dead.
   About 100,000 Soviet troops moved into Afghanistan on Dec. 27,
1979, to replace one pro-Moscow government with another.
   They stayed on to help fight the U.S.-backed guerrillas, who
began their insurgency when the Afghan communists seized power in a
1978 coup.
   The Kremlin completed a phased withdrawal of its troops Feb. 15
after fighting the guerrillas to a stalemate. Moscow continues
massive military supplies to the Kabul government.
   The Marxists still hold Afghanistan's major cities but the
guerrillas _ who call themselves Islamic ``holy warriors,'' _
control most of the countryside.
   Afghans at refugee camps in Pakistan held rallies to mark
Wednesday's anniversary.
   In Moscow, ceremonies mourned the 14,000 soldiers the Soviet
Union says it lost during the nine-year fight.
   Some 1.5 million Afghans are believed to have died in the
fighting. About 5 million have fled to Pakistan and Iran, or about
a third of the country's pre-war population.

<HEAD>Republic's Parliament Votes To Drop Communists' Guarantee of Power</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A second Baltic republic in less than a month has
voted to scrap constitutional guarantees of the Communist Party's
grip on power, said local activists and journalists in Latvia.
   The republic's parliament voted 220-50 on Thursday to drop the
constitutional provision that makes the party the ``leading and
guiding force of Soviet society,'' said Viysturs Koziols of the
Latvian People's Front newspaper Atmoda.
   Eriks Kehriks, chief of the official news agency Latinform,
confirmed the action.
   Neighboring Lithuania voted Dec. 7 to strip the Communist Party
of its leading role in society, and most of Eastern Europe shed
such provisions this year.
   Koziols said the Latvian parliament voted after a stormy debate
that lasted more than three hours.
   Sarmite Elerte, spokeswoman for the grass-roots Popular Front
movement, said the decision must be made final at parliament's next
session Jan. 10-11. Specific language is to be adopted then on
constitutional amendments legalizing alternative political parties.
   The change is expected to reduce the party's grip on all spheres
of life in the republic. Like its neighbors Lithuania and Estonia,
Latvia has a broad-based movement seeking independence from the
Soviet Union, which forcibly annexed all three nations in 1940.
   Lithuania also legalized alternative political parties.
   Its action to drop constiutional provisions giving power to the
Communists was the first threat to the party's guaranteed supremacy
in the Soviet Union.
   Since then, the issue has arisen in the national Congress of
People's Deputies and the parliaments of Estonia and Armenia, all
of which have similar provisions in their constitutions.
   None has taken a formal vote on the issue, but Estonia is
expected to in January.
   Lithuania's legalization of a multiparty system also helped push
the republic's Communist Party into breaking with the national
party last week.
   The Lithuanian Communists formed a separate party, which favors
independence. That move infuriated many Kremlin Communists, and the
national party's Central Committee decided to send its leader,
President Mikhail S. Gorbchev, to Lithuania next week to discuss
the dispute.
   On Thursday, tens of thousands of Lithuanians rallied to support
the republic's Communists against the Kremlin.
   The national television news show ``Vremya'' said thousands of
people gathered in Vilnius, Kaunas and Klaipede to hear ``bold,
uncompromising speeches'' supporting the party separatists.
   Scenes of the demonstration in Vilnius showed a huge crowd on
the central Gediminas Square numbering more than 50,000.
   The Latvian parliament also considered reinstating the flag and
national anthem of the independent republic that existed between
the two world wars, said Latinform's Kehriks. The vote was
postponed until January.
   In Estonia, the parliament approved hefty taxes on alcohol and
tobacco to finance pay raises for teachers, doctors, journalists
and others in social and cultural work, said Estonian Radio
commentator Peep Kala. Student stipends also will rise, he said.
   The retail price of beer will double, while the average price of
tobacco products will rise 50 percent and alcoholic beverages by 20
percent, Kala said.

   Harvard University, whose name has been
emblazoned on sweatshirts from Los Angeles to Maine as well as on
shot glasses, towels, watches and boxer shorts, has decided to make
the name a trademark.
   Under new licensing procedures, Crimson-themed boxer shorts may
still be allowed. But string bikinis? Maybe not.
   Licensing will protect Harvard name, according to Ellen Mitchell
of the Harvard Office of Patents, Copyrights and Licensing.
   ``We just don't want it to be outrageous,'' she said. ``We don't
want to look silly.''
   More than 100 U.S. colleges and universities already issue
licenses for the use of their name, including the seven other Ivy
League colleges, according to the office of Robert Scott, vice
president for finance.
   Margot Naulleau, international licensing coordinator for
Champion Products Inc., one of the main suppliers of athletic wear
with college insignias, said Harvard was one of the last big
schools in the country to issue a trademark.
   But Harvard officials had a good explanation.
   ``It's simply that we are very old and very conservative. It
took us a long time to decide if it was something that we ought to
do,'' said Joyce Brinton, director of the patent office. She said
there was no incident that led to the decision to apply for a
trademark, such as a particularly egregious product on the market.
   ``It was just that the time has come,'' she said.
   Before the Harvard Corporation decided in June to apply for a
trademark on the name from the U.S. Patent and Trademarking Office,
Brinton's office had ``inquiries from many, many manufacturers''
about getting a license.
   ``I think most of the companies have felt uncomfortable that
they don't have a license from Harvard,'' said Brinton. Those
companies worried that if they didn't have a license, they ran the
risk of being left with hundreds of products if the school's
lawyers suddenly cracked down on the name's usage, she said.
   Harvard ran a few trial programs before moving towards licensing
on a broad scale. At the school's 350th anniversary in 1986,
Harvard wanted to ensure commemorative items were of high quality.
Another program licensing the trademark in Japan has been booming,
bringing in $130,000 in royalties annually.
   Under the new licensing procedure, if someone wants to make a
product bearing the name Harvard, Harvard University, or the
school's insignia, they must first show designs and samples to
demonstrate the quality of the product before Harvard will grant a
license.
   And the cost of renting the Harvard name? A bargain, Mitchell
said. Brinton said companies that market Harvard products pay a
flat fee of $300 and sales royalties of 7{ percent.

<HEAD>Eastern Cuts 600 Jobs, Trims 10,000 Salaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines plans 600 more layoffs along with
salary cuts for half its employees under measures to stem the flood
of red ink that has swamped the airline for a decade.
   About 10,000 workers will have wages temporarily slashed from 10
percent to 20 percent, although some of those cuts must be
negotiated with the Air Line Pilots Association and the flight
attendants union.
   The principal cause of the cuts _ which were announced Thursday
_ is the sale of Eastern's Latin American routes to American
Airlines.
   But Tom Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president for human
resources, also cited ``the softness in the economy ... the
increase in fuel prices, the extensive competition in the Miami
hub,'' particularly from Pan American World Airways.
   The package is expected to save $100 million next year for
Eastern, which reported a $185.2 million loss in this year's third
quarter.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said pay and benefit reductions
were ``something we wanted to avoid,'' but that large losses are
expected to continue in the first half of the new year.
   The cuts are also part of Eastern's bankruptcy court plan for
financial reorganization that stemmed from the March 4 strike that
virtually idled the Miami-based carrier for weeks. Eastern claimed
it was losing $1 million a day prior to the strike.
   The majority of the layoffs will involve administrative and
airport service personnel, and will not include the unionized
pilots, flight attendants or mechanics.
   Attrition and early retirement will blunt the effects of the
cutbacks, but a number of operations-related employees will be out
of work Jan. 31 as Miami operations fall from 75 to 50 daily
flights.
   Job cuts also will come July 1 when American Airlines is
scheduled to assume the Latin routes.
   Meanwhile, half of Eastern's 20,000 employees _ including
management, pilots and flight attendants working at the older,
higher wage levels _ will have their wages cut by 10 percent to 20
percent for a year, beginning Jan. 16.
   About 850 pilots will see their $72,000 salaries slashed by 20
percent for six months. Half of the cut will be restored after six
months, and wages are scheduled to return to normal after a year.
About 950 newly hired pilots are working for $27,500 a year and
will not be affected.
   Flight attendants earning a pre-strike salary of $30,000 a year
will take a 15 percent initial cut, but those hired under the new
wage levels of $15,000 will not.
   Machinists, who had cuts imposed when the strike began, aren't
affected. Machinists remain the only group that hasn't gone back to
work.
   Mary Jane Barry, head of Eastern's flight attendants union,
refused to comment on the proposal, saying negotiations were
continuing. Calls to ALPA were not returned.
   Eastern employed 32,000 before the strike began, and the airline
filed for bankruptcy protection five days later.
   Eastern, a Texas Air Corp. subsidiary, plans to reshape itself
with about 75 percent of its operations centered at Atlanta.

<HEAD>Light Icing of Wings Reported Before Crash That Killed Six</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASCO, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De-icing equipment and other parts of a
commuter plane that will be tested in an effort to find the cause
of a crash that killed all six people aboard the plane.
   The crew of the United Express plane from Seattle reported light
icing about an hour before it crashed at a small airport 180 miles
southeast of Seattle, Barry Trotter of the National Transportation
Safety Board said Thursday.
   De-icing and other equipment was being checked, but it is much
too early to determine the cause of the accident Tuesday, Trotter
said.
   ``We still have not discounted anything and we are still looking
at everything,'' he said at a news conference.
   The British Aerospace Jetstream 31 slammed into a sagebrush
field short of the runway and burst into flames, killing two crew
members and four passengers.
   ``Several other aircraft that had landed (prior to the crash)
reported light icing to insignificant icing,'' Trotter said. ``An
hour and 15 minutes before the accident, this aircraft reported
light icing.''
   But he said the crew didn't report any trouble in its final
communication with the airport control tower or the FAA control
center in Seattle just minutes before the plane went down.
   Icing tends to slow a plane's forward speed or force it downward
by increasing aircraft weight and drag and reducing lift and thrust.
   The plane had made 7,161 flights before to the crash and its
flight history and maintenance records appeared clean, Trotter said.
   United Express _ one of several similarly named commuter
airlines around the country _ is based in Pasco and serves 15
cities in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.
   It serves as a feeder airline for United Airlines, with which it
has a marketing agreement that permits it to use United's computer
system and logo. United Express, operated by NPA Inc., began
commercial air service in July 1987.
   Killed in the crash were the two crew members, Capt. Barry
``Will'' Roberts, 38, the pilot, and First Officer Doug McInroe,
25, the copilot, both of Kennewick; and passengers Kim Shewmaker,
34, also a United Express pilot who has a home in Kimberly, Idaho,
and an apartment in Richland; Rey Resendez, 46, of Duncanville,
Texas; Wayne Kingry, 42, of Denver; and Elliott Fischer, 56, of
Seal Beach, Calif., who recently moved to Richland.

<HEAD>Market Ends Year At Another Record High, Up 29 Percent Since January</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed its 1989 trading
today with a half-day session in a festival mood, and the fourth
consecutive day of record-setting left the market's key index 29
percent higher than at the year's beginning.
   The dollar rose sharply, closing 1989 at a level 13.9 percent
above its 1988 close.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the stock exchange's main
barometer, finished at 38,915.87 points on its fourth consecutive
day of setting a record-high closing. In just a half-day session,
it gained 38.93 points, or 0.1 percent.
   The stock market opened 1989 on Jan. 4 with the Nikkei at
30,243.66, and the index followed its familiar upward direction
throughout the year, reaching the 35,000-point mark Aug. 16 and the
38,000-point mark Dec. 13.
   Its 1989 gain of 29.0 percent, however, was below 1988's 39.9
percent.
   The dollar closed today at 143.40, up 1.25 yen from Thursday's
close of 142.15. It opened at 143.45 and stayed in a narrow range
between 143.15 yen and 143.60 yen. It had gained 0.05 yen on
Thursday after a five-day decline totaling 2.13 yen.
   The U.S. currency had ended 1988 trading at 125.90 yen. This
year, despite pressure from the world's monetary authorities to
reduce its strength, it traded as high as 151.30 in June.
   After a New Year holiday, the Tokyo markets will reopen Thursday.
   The stock market was particularly strong in the last two months
of this year, when domestic politics finally settled down after a
long period of instability and investors looked for business
opportunities from the reform movements in Eastern Europe.
   Tokyo share prices recovered quickly from the crash in October,
when Wall Street's confidence was shaken by the failure of a United
Airlines buyout effort.
   Following an abrupt drop of 7.1 percent in the Dow Jones
industrial average on the New York Stock Exchange Oct. 13, the main
index in London fell 3.2 percent and the Frankfurt market lost 13.2
percent.
   Tokyo shares, however, declined only 1.8 percent, or 647.33
points, on the first trading day after the Wall Street crash, and
quickly regained 527.39 points the next day. In the next two
months, the index rose about 10 percent.
   ``I think the Tokyo market's strength was reconfirmed this year
when the crashes in the New York and London markets were blocked by
Tokyo's strength,'' said Josen Takahashi, a chief analyst at
Mitsubishi Research Institute, a major private think tank.
   The Tokyo market also had recovered quickly from the crash of
October 1987 and emerged as a powerhouse of world stock markets.
   Today the Tokyo market's capitalization is estimated at $3.5
trillion, more than 25 percent larger than the New York Stock
Exchange, and Tokyo is outperforming other major stock markets
around the world.
   Analysts said the Tokyo market overcame a number of obstacles
this year, including the death of Emperor Hirohito in January, the
resignations of two prime ministers in two months, currency
fluctuations and fear of creeping inflation.
   ``There were some negative factors this year, but overall, the
market situation was bullish throughout the year,'' said Ichitaro
Watanabe, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co.
   In the currency market, dealers attributed the dollar's upward
trend throughout 1989 to the gap in key interest rates between
Japan and the United States.
   Lower interest rates, like Japan's, tend to make a nation's
currency less attractive to investors.
   On Monday, the Bank of Japan, in an effort to stem inflationary
pressure, raised the discount rate _ the rate the central bank
charges on its loans to commercial banks _ to 4.25 percent from
3.75 percent.
   The dollar, however, showed a moderate decline of only 0.95 yen
against the Japanese currency after the announcement and began
climbing again on Thursday.
   But dealers say the dollar is expected to head downward early
next year in anticipation of a further downswing in U.S. interest
rates, the subject of speculation in recent weeks.

   About 800 people, including political leaders,
gaming executives and weathered cowboys in 10-gallon hats, turned
out for an emotional funeral service for Las Vegas casino pioneer
Benny Binion.
   ``I never met anybody that met Benny Binion who didn't like him
in two minutes,'' close friend Steve Wynn said at Thursday's
service. ``I never met anybody that met Benny Binion that didn't
respect him in five minutes. He was the most extraordinary man I
ever met.''
   Binion, owner of Horseshoe Casino, died Christmas Day of a
heart-related condition. He was 85.
   A funeral procession stretched several blocks from the suburban
Roman Catholic church Binion helped build to a cemetery where he
was buried, just blocks from his downtown casino.
   Wynn, chairman of the Mirage hotel on the Las Vegas Strip and
the Golden Nugget across downtown's Glitter Gulch from Binion's
Horseshoe Casino, nodded toward Binion's casket, topped by the
gambler's trademark cowboy hat.
   ``We're going to see a lot more cowboy hats and cowboy boots in
this town. But I don''t think anybody is going to see the likes of
Benny Binion again,'' he said.
   The Rev. Bill Kenny of Christ the King Church praised Binion as
a man who was ``like a grizzly bear outside but inside like a
lamb.''
   Binion's death further thinned the ranks of the flamboyant
old-time gamblers who built Las Vegas from a wide spot on a desert
road to the nation's gambling Mecca, only to see their casinos
taken over in recent years by major corporations.
   He was born in Grayson County, Texas, to a family that sold race
horses on the county fair circuit, a connection that provided his
entry into the gambling world. He started by running illegal craps
games, usually out of hotel rooms.
   Binion moved to Las Vegas in 1946 and bought the Horseshoe
casino five years later, quickly building it into one of the city's
premiere attractions.
   The Horseshoe Club, noted for its million-dollar craps table
bets, its annual $10,000 buy-in World Series of Poker tournament
and its $1 million collection of $10,000 bills, now occupies a city
block.

   The Lake Superior snowbelt, Montana and the mountains of the
desert Southwest braced for snow today as sleet and freezing rain
left an icy swath from South Dakota to northern West Virginia.
   A cold front in southern Wisconsin was expected to sink into
southern Iowa by Friday morning, continuing south into Missouri
later in the day. Temperatures in the region should cool gradually
cool as the weather becomes more unsettled.
   High pressure should move away from the area around the nation's
capital today, making way for the front now in the Upper Midwest.
Clouds and precipitation were expected to return to the region for
the weekend.
   A winter storm watch was posted through today in northern
Arizona's higher elevations. Up to 4 inches of snow was expected in
elevations above 6,000 feet.
   Wintry weather may return to New Mexico for the weekend, as a
developing storm system could bring new snow to the northern
mountains.
   Light snow or freezing drizzle was forecast today across South
Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   A snow squall advisory was extended in Wisconsin along Lake
Superior, where up to 4 inches of snow fell Thursday. An additional
3 to 6 inches was expected today.
   Snow across north-central Montana Thursday left 3 inches at
Havre, 4 inches at Great Falls and more in the mountains.
   Snow mixed with sleet and freezing rain was forecast for
Illinois and northern Ohio today, and was expected later in western
Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia.
   Snow was falling today in northern Maine, central New Hampshire
and New York state, northwest Pennsylvania, Upper Michigan,
northern Lower Michigan and northern Wisconsin and Minnesota.
   Rain was scattered across Texas and southwest Louisiana.
   Over 8 inches of snow fell in Syracuse, N.Y., between midnight
and 3 p.m. EST Thursday, making this the city's snowiest December
on record with 57 inches. Syracuse's total snowfall this season is
73.2 inches, another record.
   Newark, N.J., is shivering through its coldest December on
record, according to the National Weather Service.
   The average temperature in Newark in December 1989 was 25.1
degrees. December 1945, which had an average temperature of 29
degrees, was the previous coldest December on record.
   Thursday's high temperature in the nation was 79 at McAllen, Tex.

   A judge who grew up in a public housing project
fought back tears as he was sworn in as the first black to serve on
the Georgia Supreme Court.
   Robert Benham said his family ``knew this day would come. They
knew there was nothing we couldn't do and ... nothing that could
hold us down.''
   Benham, a Court of Appeals judge for 5{ years, was named to the
state's highest court earlier this month by Gov. Joe Frank Harris,
and was given the oath of office Thursday during ceremonies at the
Capitol.
   During an acceptance speech, he had to fight back tears when he
declared his joy that his parents not only lived to see the
ceremony, but were able to participate in it.
   He said his success showed that a person ``can be born like I
was, raised in public housing ... and rise to the statehouse on
Capitol Hill.''
   Benham, 43, succeeds Justice Thomas O. Marshall, who is retiring
at the end of this month.
   The appointment lasts only through November, when the court seat
will be up for election.

   Florida and Texas officials are taking stock of crop damage from
the hard Christmas freeze and taking steps to help growers who lost
millions and farm workers who lost their jobs.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez declared his entire state a disaster
area Thursday and sought federal help, while Texas officials worked
to open relief centers for farm workers displaced by the worst
freeze to hit the lower Rio Grande Valley in six years.
   Elsewhere in the Deep South, crews worked to restore water
service after the past week's freezing weather burst pipes and
mains.
   Somewhat more moderate temperatures were returning to the South,
though at 5 a.m. EST today it was only 36 degrees in Jacksonville,
Fla., 33 degrees in Macon, Ga., and 26 degrees in Knoxville, Tenn.
Cities in the North were being spared the arctic blasts of recent
weeks, though snow fell from Salt Lake City to the Dakotas this
morning.
   The hard freeze Saturday and Sunday nights damaged oranges and
grapefruit in Florida's 700,000-acre citrus belt as well as winter
vegetable crops. The dollar value of the loss had yet to be
determined.
   The state's tropical fish industry, sugar cane crops and plant
nurseries also were hurt badly.
   After visiting several freeze-damaged farms, Martinez signed an
executive order declaring the disaster in all 67 Florida counties.
The move opens the way for a possible federal disaster declaration
by President Bush.
   ``From what I have seen, there is no question that Florida has
suffered devastating losses and that our state is a disaster
area,'' Martinez said. ``We must now do everything we can to help
those whose lives and livelihoods have been ravaged by the
unmerciful weather.''
   In a letter, Martinez asked Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yuetter to approve Farmers Home Administration loans for growers.
Unemployment assistance, direct grants and other help also could
become available if Bush declares a disaster.
   State agriculture officials will assess each county to compile
loss estimated, which would be needed before a federal declaration
is made. That could take two or three weeks.
   A freeze in 1985 freeze cost the Florida citrus industry alone
about $255 million.
   Higher vegetable prices have already been reported, but the
impact on citrus prices could be minimal because of a large juice
reserve and the quick processing of frostbitten fruit into juice
concentrate.
   Florida's 33 citrus processing plants were pushed to the limit
Thursday in an effort to salvage frozen fruit and squeeze it into
juice before it spoils.
   ``We'll be open 24 hours per day, seven days a week during the
salvage process,'' said Steve Caruso, assistant general manager at
Citrus World, a processing plant in Lake Wales that produces about
400,000 gallons of fresh juice daily.
   In Texas, officials estimated that 60 percent of the lower Rio
Grande Valley's $80 million citrus crop and 80 percent of its
vegetable crop was lost when temperatures dropped into the teens
and 20s last weekend.
   There are 15,000 farmworker families in the Rio Grande Valley,
and Hidalgo County Judge Edgar Ruiz expects many to seek help
because without crops, they won't have work. The American Red
Cross, the Texas Department of Human Services and Hidalgo County
plan to open four relief centers.
   In Jackson, Miss., where an estimated 60,000 people were without
water or had greatly reduced pressure earlier this week, city crews
finished repairing 28 remaining breaks in the city's 900 miles of
pipes and mains.
   City officials asked some businesses to conserve water, but told
residents Thursday night they could safely use tap water for the
first time in nearly a week.
   Jackson officials also reported two cold-related fatalities,
including a 62-year-old man who died of heart problems when he fell
in a lake while trying to collect water to flush his toilet.
   At least 104 deaths nationwide since Dec. 15 have been
attributed to the cold. Several of the victims were children in
Southern states who fell through ice on ponds or lakes.
   The cold killed fish in Louisiana bayous and is threatening sea
turtles around Florida. The cold-blooded reptiles are sensitive to
temperatures and the cold makes them lethargic. Also in Florida,
the cold chased endangered manatees into pockets of warm water near
power plants.

   High winds aloft and low
temperatures on the ground combined to force the seventh
postponement of Martin Marietta's first commercial rocket launch _
but another try is set for tonight.
   Company officials reported winds about 30,000 feet above the
launch area were too stiff Thursday and the temperature on the
ground was too cool.
   The temperature must be at least 62 degrees for the launch of
the Titan 3 rocket. That will preserve the resiliency of synthetic
O-rings between joints in its two solid fuel rocket boosters.
   The rocket is to boost into orbit communications satellites for
a Japanese company and British Ministry for Defense.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:06 p.m. EST today. It was
originally set for Dec. 7, but a combination of bad weather and
technical problems resulted in repeated delays.

<HEAD>Top Aide to Noriega is Former Israeli Intelligence Agent</HEAD>

   An Israeli who served as a top adviser to
deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega reportedly led a
famous bungled mission as chief of special operations for Israel's
spy agency.
   The mission set out to catch the Palestinians who carried out
the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics but
wound up killing a Moroccan-born waiter in Norway in a case of
mistaken identity.
   Michael Harari, whose arrest in Panama was reported Thursday,
was a security adviser to Noriega and an instructor for Panamanian
Defense Forces, according to a U.S. Embassy official in Panama who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Spokesmen for the Israeli foreign and defense ministries refused
comment today on the arrest, saying Harari was a private citizen.
   But the exploits of the 62-year-old former Israeli army colonel
have been described extensively in Israeli newspapers.
   The daily Yediot Ahronot said Harari helped Noriega recruit
Israeli mercenaries as his personal bodyguards over the last year.
   The newspaper also said a second Israeli, Eliezer Ben Giton,
surrendered to U.S. troops outside the Vatican mission in Panama
City and identified himself as ``responsible for the personal
security of Gen. Manuel Noriega.''
   U.S. troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to seize Noriega and take
him to the United States to stand trial on drug-trafficking
charges. But he eluded capture and took refuge in the Vatican
mission on Sunday.
   The independent Haaretz daily said Israel, under strong U.S.
pressure to cut contacts with Noriega, convinced Harari to leave
Panama last year.
   But the former agent with the Israeli Mossad spy agency later
returned. Haaretz reported that Harari told Israeli officials that
if he did not work with Noriega, his role would be filled by Cubans
or Nicaraguans.
   Israel's ambassador to Panama, Reuven Ben-Eliezer, told Israel
army radio in an interview from New York that he had no contact
with Harari.
   ``I don't know who Harari is, I didn't see him, I didn't meet
him, I didn't get orders from him, and he also didn't receive''
orders from Israel's embassy in Panama, Ben-Eliezer said in an
interview recorded Wednesday but first broadcast today.
   ``He is a private Israeli. I don't know what he did there. He
did business and he was appointed by Noriega as honorary general
counsul for Panama in Israel,'' Ben-Eliezer said.
   Yediot described Harari as the former chief of Mossad's special
operations and said his best-known case was the bungled effort to
kill the leader of the Palestinian Black September group that
massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.
   The case is also described in the book ``The Quest for the Red
Prince'' by Israeli authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Eitan Haber.
   Haber, now spokesman for Defense Secretary Yitzhak Rabin,
refused to comment on the case.
   In the book, the team leader is referred to only as ``Mike,''
but sources familiar with the case have said it was Harari.
   According to the accounts, Harari led a 15-member Mossad hit
squad to kill the Palestinian group's leader, Ali Hassan Salameh.
But the chase ended on May 23, 1973, when agents shot and killed a
waiter in Lillehammer, Norway.
   The incident embarrassed the Mossad and the service's image was
further tarnished when six agents and other Israelis involved in
the mission were arrested by Norwegian police.

   The dollar was higher in quiet European trading
late this morning. Gold prices also moved up.
   In the foreign exchange markets, the few remaining market
participants were covering short positions on the last business day
of 1989, dealers said. That meant they were buying dollars to
fulfill agreements to sell them.
   Traders said activity was reduced to a minimum as most players
already have closed their books for the year.
   ``The market is very restricted, but after it (the dollar)
touched bottom at 1.6650 (West German) marks, some banks started to
cover short positions,'' one Milan trader said.
   He said he didn't expect any major moves in the dollar for the
rest of the day, as most banks were closing early today ahead of a
three-day New Year's weekend.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.25 yen to a closing 143.40 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6965 West German marks, up from 1.6905
   _1.5490 Swiss francs, up from 1.5385
   _5.8055 French francs, up from 5.7665
   _1.9170 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9000
   _1,273.50 Italian lire, up from 1,264.50
   _1.1585 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1563
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6043 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6137 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $400.25 a troy ounce, up
from $399.50 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $401.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $401.00, up from $400.00 bid late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $1.72 to close at a bid $399.89.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.18 a troy ounce from
Thursday's $5.15.

<HEAD>Bradley Admits No Wrong, But Uses Own Money to Settle Ethics Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley admitted no wrongdoing but
agreed to spend $20,000 of his own money to settle an ethics
lawsuit charging he unlawfully failed to disclose personal
financial holdings, a judge said.
   The agreement disclosed Thursday settles a civil lawsuit filed
Sept. 13 by City Attorney James K. Hahn. It charged Bradley with
failing to report personal financial holdings, amounting to roughly
$160,000, on six occasions.
   Typically, politicians have been allowed to use campaign funds
to settle such lawsuits, said Superior Court Judge Robert I. Weil,
who called the Bradley deal ``unique and extraordinary.''
   Nevertheless, Weil said Thursday that Bradley's errors were acts
of negligence, not done with criminal or willful intent. The
settlement, Weil added, ``does not constitute an admission of
liability.''
   Bradley said in a statement: ``Though none of my mistakes was
intentional, I have repeatedly taken public responsibility for the
inadvertent errors.
   ``Therefore, I chose the highly unusual step of resolving this
manner by paying the settlement from my own resources. The decision
to use my personal funds was mine and mine alone.''
   Hahn, however, characterized Bradley's violations as
``significant'' and said the $20,000 Bradley paid personally to
settle the case was unprecedented.
   ``The fact that he is the mayor, the chief executive officer of
the entire municipal corporation of Los Angeles, I think, holds him
to a high degree of requirement to fill out these statements of
economic interest accurately every year,'' Hahn said.
   The lawsuit was filed after the mayor revealed he had made more
than 100 errors and omissions in his statements of economic
interest from 1984 to 1988. At least $222,000 in investments and
income weren't reported; Hahn sued over $160,000 of it.
   The agreement settles only one aspect of Bradley's crisis over
ethics and finances.
   A federal grand jury is investigating the mayor's business ties
to eight banks, savings and loans associations and brokerage firms
for possible insider stock trading or violations of federal laws
aimed at political corruption.

   The army today ordered an investigation into
the shooting of two 12-year-old Palestinians in an assault on
masked Arabs a day earlier in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The army said the shootings were accidental. Both boys were
reported in good condition today at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital.
   Also today, a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israel
was hacked to death by masked Arabs in Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee
camp, Arab reports said.
   The slaying of Ahmad Mohammed Abu Shahmeh, 56, came a day after
PLO leader Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction called for
restraining slayings of alleged collaborators in a leaflet
distributed in Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
   Today's death raised to at least 164 the number of Palestinians
killed by fellow Arabs during the 2-year-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied lands. Most were suspected of
collaboration.
   A total of 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
uprising, and 43 Israelis also have died.
   The army said in a statement issued today about the 12-year-olds
tthat soldiers detected four masked Arab youths in Gaza City and
``fired according to regulations.''
   ``Apparently children were near the group of masked people and
therefore injured by gunfire,'' it added. One masked youth also was
wounded.
   Under army firing rules, troops can shoot at the legs of masked
Palestinians who flee despite soldiers' orders to halt and warning
shots fired in the air.
   Palestinian reporters on Thursday quoted one of the wounded
Palestinians as saying none of the victims wore masks but that one
ran away in fear when soldiers approached.
   The house of a 41-year-old Palestinian arrested on suspicion of
killing suspected collaborators was demolished today by the army.
The four-room house of Hamdi Sheikh Khalil in Gaza City was home to
seven people, Arab reports said.
   The army has demolished or sealed more than 360 Palestinian
homes since the start of the uprising.
   A hand-grenade was thrown into a restaurant early today in the
town of Petah Tikva near Tel Aviv, wounding one Palestinian and
leaving another hospitalized with shock, police said.
   Police said one man was taken into custody in the incident,
adding they suspected ``criminal motives'' in the case. The Itim
national news agency said the man arrested was wearing the skull
cap of an observant Jew.
   Tension in Petah Tikva involving Arab day laborers led the town
earlier this year to set up a ``holding area'' to segregate
Palestinians waiting for rides to and from the occupied territories.

   One of four Florida lawyers representing ousted
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega has asked to be allowed to
quit in part because of public statements by the other attorneys in
the case.
   ``It was a question of drawing the line between function as a
lawyer and a general spokesperson,'' attorney Neal Sonnett said
Thursday. He said he'd rather not discuss his other reasons for
withdrawing.
   ``I have consistently refused to comment on Panamanian affairs _
they are outside my responsibility,'' he told The Associated Press.
``It's important for me to practice law.''
   ``I didn't really want to create a firestorm,'' he added.
``There have been other conflicts between me and co-counsel but
nothing I feel is appropriate to discuss.''
   Sonnett filed a motion Wednesday with the U.S. District Court
asking that he be allowed to quit representing Noriega on federal
drug charges filed in Miami in February 1988. The court usually
grants such requests.
   Although Sonnett in recent months has indicated that he was
pulling back from the case, both Frank Rubino and Raymond Takiff,
also Noreiga attorneys, said they were surprised by Sonnett's
motion.
   ``We've had no problems whatsoever,'' said Takiff. ``Just
general differences of opinion.''
   Takiff said he found Sonnett's move puzzling, especially since
Sonnett recently appeared on CNN's ``Crossfire'' and spoke of
Noriega.
   Sonnett countered that he appeared on the news show as president
of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to discuss
forfeiture of attorney's fees. He said he didn't talk about the
general.
   A fourth Noriega attorney, Steve Kollin, said he had no comment.
   Noriega was seeking asylum at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.

<TEXT>
   Pro-Indian Tamil guerrillas ambushed
and killed at least 18 members of the rival Tamil Tigers militia in
northern Sri Lanka, residents said today.
   The attack in the Vavuniya district occurred Thursday night,
barely 24 hours after the Tigers ambushed and killed 28 members of
another Tamil band in the same area.
   Tamil residents in Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast of Colombo,
said the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam attacked a
Tiger patrol in Musalkutti southwest of Vavuniya on Thursday
evening.
   The residents were contacted by telephone and spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   On Wednesday, the Tigers ambushed two trucks carrying members of
the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front, killing 28 of
them. Three Tigers also died in that battle just west of Vavuniya.
   The People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam and the the
Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front are allies in the
struggle for power against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
the strongest Tamil militant group.
   The front won control of the provincial council a year ago in
elections boycotted by the Tigers, who now are trying to dislodge
the front and force new elections.
   The Tigers also have been battling the Indian peacekeeping force
sent to Sri Lanka in July 1987 to disarm Tamil guerrillas who had
been fighting Sri Lanka's Sinhalese-dominated government for a
separate homeland in northeastern Sri Lanka. The two smaller Tamil
groups agreed to give up armed struggle, but the Tigers refused to
surrender their weapons an started attacking the Indian force.
   The Indians have been winding down their military presence and
pulled out of the Vavuniya area today. They have withdrawn from six
of the eight northeastern districts they once patrolled but remain
in the major population centers of Trincomalee and Jaffna.
   The peacekeeping operation grew out of a July 1987 peace plan.
The government of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said in
September its troowould take longer.
   Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said the withdrawal
should be over by March 31.
   Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said today he had
not been formally notified of India's new timetable.
   ``They (the Indians) appear to have decided on their own,''
Wijeratne said. He said he would have no further comment until he
received a detailed report from the Sri Lankan Embassy in New Delhi.
   An estimated 25,000 Indian soldiers remain in Sri Lanka. India
became involved because of the sympathies of its own politically
powerful Tamil minority of 60 million from their fellow Tamils in
Sri Lanka.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
say the Sinhalese majority discriminates against them.
   More than 11,000 people, including 1,100 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the northeast since the Tamil separatist revolt
started in 1983. Six thousand have died in backlash by Sinhalese
extremists in the Sinhalese heartland of central and southern Sri
Lanka who accused the government of making too many concessions to
the Tamils.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Street fighting between rival
groups near the southern town of Uitenhage left at least five black
men dead and seven seriously injured, police reported today.
   Police said the battle Thursday was part of an ongoing feud
between supporters of the United Democratic Front, a nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition, and a group of ``Africanists.''
   Most Africanists are aligned with the outlawed Pan Africanist
Congress, which favors black self-reliance in the quest of
political rights as opposed to the Front's multiracial approach.
   Those killed and injured ranged in age from 16 to 43 and were
stabbed or suffered blows to the head during two hours of fighting
in Kwanobuhle, a township outside Uitenhage, police said.
   The two groups have fought sporadically for political control of
the area since 1987, according to the independent South Africa
Press Association.
   The Front also is involved in a power struggle in Natal
Province, where fighting with Inkatha, a relatively conservative
Zulu organization, has left about 2,500 people dead over the past
three years.

   The director of an anti-nuclear power group
says he's alarmed the Beaver Valley nuclear plant did not get fined
for lapses that included security officers napping on the job.
   ``If you have this many lapses in a good program, it's scary to
think what a bad program is like,'' said Ken Bossong, director of
the Critical Mass Energy Project, which is affiliated with the
consumer group Public Citizen.
   ``The absence of any fines or other reprimands shows lax
oversight'' by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, he said.
   A plant security officer tampered with a safety-related device
and others slept on duty, The Pittsburgh Press reported Thursday.
   The newspaper also said a security supervisor at the plant in
Shippingport, about 25 miles from Pittsburgh, placed an unloaded
pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger in January 1988. And in
October, two guards each allowed a person to enter the plant
without required authorization.
   The newspaper said its report was based on a review of NRC
records and interviews with officials at the NRC and Duquesne Light
Co., the operator of the two-reactor complex.
   Duquesne Light spokesman Kenneth Service said the incidents drew
strong disciplinary action, including firings and suspensions. No
fines were imposed by the NRC.
   ``Throughout this period we've had a high level of security and
continue to have a high level of security,'' Service said. ``None
of these individual items in any way degraded the level of security
or safety at the plant.''
   The NRC's past three performance assessments, covering 1986
through August 1989, gave Duquesne Light the highest of three
possible ratings for security.

<TEXT>
   The man believed to be the oldest
working cowboy in Texas lay down in a field and died, the way he
once said he thought he ought to go.
   Thomas Everett Blasingame, 91, was found lying on his back, his
hands folded on his chest, on Wednesday by employees of JA Cattle
Co. of Goodnight, where Blasingame worked. His saddled horse roamed
nearby.
   ``He must have known he was in trouble, dismounted and just laid
down and died. There were no bruises or scratches so he wasn't
bucked off, but he was riding a young horse he was training,'' said
ranch manager Johnny Farrar.
   Blasingame said in an interview with the Wichita Falls Times
last summer that that's the way he ought to die.
   He was honored Aug. 19 during the Texas Ranch Roundup. Officials
there said Blasingame was the oldest working cowboy in the state.
   Born on Feb. 2, 1898, in Waxahachie, Texas, Blasingame was a
cowboy all his life. He was 35 when he married his wife, Eleanor.
   ``His life was a better life than what you and I live,'' she
said last summer. ``He doesn't worry about more than one thing at a
time and that's what he's doing right then.''
   Among other honors, he earned the Western Heritage Wrangler
Award presented by the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.
   Services are set for Saturday at the JA Cattle Co. Cemetery near
Clarendon.

   The Vatican is urging Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega to leave his refuge at its embassy in Panama
City, a Holy See spokesman said today.
   The spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, also criticized U.S. activities
outside the Vatican embassy and said ``steps'' would be taken if
the disturbances continue. He did not elaborate.
   U.S. forces have staked out the mission and blasted rock music
from a stereo system in the street to try to put pressure on
Noriega to surrender to be prosecuted on U.S. drug trafficking
charges.
   ``The nuncio is doing his best to convince Gen. Noriega to
abandon the nunciature on his own, by himself,'' spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said. ``At the same time he cannot force Noriega to leave
nor can he consign him to U.S forces.''
   It was the first time the Vatican said publicly it was trying to
persuade Noriega to leave. However, Navarro said the possibility
had been discussed with Noriega since he took refuge at the mission
on Sunday.
   In what has appeared to be a standoff, the Vatican has insisted
that the papal nunciature, or embassy, cannot legally turn the
general over to U.S. forces since, under accepted international
procedures, an embassy is only empowered to deal with the
government of the host country.
   Navarro today said the Vatican still has not received a formal
request from the new Panamanian government to turn over Noriega.
   Navarro denounced U.S. ``interference'' in the embassy's
autonomy.
   ``An occupying power cannot interfere with the works of a
diplomatic mission nor can it demand that a person seeking asylum
in that mission be handed over to it,'' Navarro said.
   He was asked to comment on U.S. tactics, such as the searching
of the nuncio or the shooting out of street lights to blacken the
area at night in hopes of thwarting a possible undetected exiting
of Noriega.
   ``If this is going to continue, further steps will be taken'' by
the Vatican, the spokesman said, without giving details. He added,
however, that the Vatican was not in a ``clash'' with the United
States.
   Navarro was asked about Panamanian officials' statements that
the government of President Guillermo Endara has sent a letter to
the Vatican asking that Noriega be expelled from the embassy.
   ``We haven't got that letter,'' Navarro said. Asked how come, he
replied, ``I don't know, ask the post office, the telex'' office,
he said.
   The Vatican's top spokesman said there had been progress in
negotiations between the United States and the Holy See over
Noriega's fate.
   Asked for details, he replied, ``The positions are clearer.''
   On Wednesday, he estimated that the standoff would be resolved
to both sides' satisfaction within a few days.
   He said today he still expected the matter to be resolved in
days but that ``it could be 20, 30 or 40 days.''

<HEAD>Canadian Judge Acquits Greenpeace Protesters, Calls Countrymen `Too
Passive'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Dollar figures in last graf are Canadian.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Greenpeace members were
acquitted of mischief by a judge who ruled that the anchoring of a
nuclear-capable U.S. Navy vessel off Vancouver was an invitation to
protest.
   Calling the defendants' fears ``the concerns of all right-minded
people'' about the dangers of nuclear weapons, provincial court
Judge Wallace Craig said Thursday that they were right to protest
and that Canadians had been too passive in the past.
   ``I think it's remarkable that the (Canadian) government has
seen fit to invite a vessel of this type,'' Craig said.
   The five were charged after they spray-painted peace symbols and
the international radiation warning symbol on the aircraft carrier
USS Independence as it attempted to anchor in English Bay on Aug.
9. A sixth protester charged with mischief, Rolph Reynolds, was
given a conditional discharge.
   The court was told Reynolds climbed the carrier's anchor chain
waving a flag.
   Craig said he accepted that the defendants believed there were
nuclear weapons aboard the ship. The U.S. Navy routinely refuses to
confirm or deny whether nuclear weapons are aboard a vessel.
   Carrier navigator Cmdr. Richard Ormsbee said Reynolds put the
vessel's captain in a perilous situation because the carrier was in
danger of running aground near Stanley Park.
   If Reynolds hadn't been dragged off the anchor chain, he said,
the captain would have been faced with dangerous choices.
   He would have been forced to either drop the port anchor,
endangering small boats near the ship's bow, drop the starboard
anchor with Reynolds on it, or throw the engines into full reverse,
swamping several small boats, Ormsbee said.
   Craig said Reynolds' actions could have caused the accident he
was trying to prevent, but refused to grant the Navy's request for
$1,950 for fuel the ship burned while the carrier was attempting to
anchor.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has rejected Pittsburgh's
request for authority to bar a menorah from the steps of the
City-County Building.
   By a 6-3 vote Thursday, the court rejected an emergency request
by the city aimed at having the menorah taken down before
Saturday's conclusion of Hanukkah. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia were in
the minority.
   City officials had asked the full court to set aside an order
Justice William J. Brennan issued last Friday letting Chabad, a
Jewish organization, erect the menorah. The menorah and a sign
saying ``Salute to Liberty'' were put in place Tuesday.
   Late Thursday, someone wrote ``PLO,'' the initials of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, on the sign. The vandal, if
caught, could be charged with criminal mischief, ethnic
intimidation and desecration of a venerated object, police Officer
Thomas Koral said.
   The menorah is a candelabrum symbolizing the eight-day Jewish
holiday.
   Earlier Thursday, the court had said it would take up the city's
request Jan. 5, during its next regularly scheduled conference _
virtually assuring that the 40-foot menorah would remain alongside
a 45-foot Christmas tree until it is taken down by Chabad members
on Saturday.
   Later in the day, the justices decided to take up the city's
request in a more timely manner.
   City officials argued that the Jewish group shouldn't have the
power to determine what will be displayed on the steps of a public
building. They argued that the area isn't a ``public forum'' open
to various messages by private citizens.
   U.S. District Judge Barron P. McCune ruled last week that the
city couldn't prevent display of the menorah, but the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia on Friday postponed the
effect of McCune's ruling.
   Brennan then set aside the 3rd Circuit order.
   The same menorah and a Christmas Nativity scene located at the
Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh was the subject of a
Supreme Court decision last summer.
   The court ruled that the menorah's display was constitutional
because it, unlike the Nativity scene, was accompanied by a
non-religious symbol, the Christmas tree.
   City officials said that ruling didn't obligate them to allow
display of the menorah, but Judge McCune ruled that the steps of
the City-County Building have become a public forum open to various
types of expression.

<HEAD>With PM-Bomb Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 30 passengers booked on a Northwest
Airlines flight to Detroit canceled their reservations today after
learning of a threat to bomb the plane, airline officials said.
   Frederic Wuatelet, sales manager at Northwest's Paris office,
said there was a steady stream of passengers calling or coming by
after the report of a threat to Saturday's Flight 51.
   ``Most of those who call are changing their flight,'' Wuatelet
said. Northwest is allowing passengers to change their bookings to
another day or another airline without penalty, but is not taking
the initiative to contact them.
   ``We're waiting for them to call us,'' he said.
   Wuatelet said at least 30 had canceled their bookings on Flight
51 by midday today, but he could not say how many passengers were
still booked on the flight.
   Tarek El-Khazindar, 28, an Egyptian, and his Minneapolis-born
wife, Brooke El-Khazindar, 29, were in the Northwest offices in
central Paris this afternoon to change their travel plans.
   ``I noticed when I was reading the paper at 8:30 this morning
that it was our flight,'' Mrs. El-Khazindar said. ``I don't know if
it's a great idea or not, but we're going to change.''
   Her husband wasn't convinced.
   ``My real instinct is just to stay on this flight,'' he said
while discussing the bomb threat with a Northwest representative.
``There's probably going to be four times more security now than on
any other plane.''
   ``But you can't be too safe,'' Mrs. El-Khazindar replied.
   In the end, they switched to a Delta flight Saturday from Paris
to Atlanta.
   Northwest announced the threat on Thursday, in an departure from
the handling of most threats against U.S. aviation, which generally
are not mentioned to passengers.
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and airlines have come
under pressure to be more forthright in disclosing security risks
after 270 people were killed Dec. 21, 1988, when a bomb blew up Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   A threat against Pan Am on the Frankfurt-to-New York route was
mentioned within the U.S. government but was not made public.
Government officials later declared the threat a hoax even though
its particulars fit the Pan Am explosion.
   In St. Paul, Minn., Northwest spokesman Douglas Miller said
tightened security would assure that Saturday's flight was safe for
those passengers who chose to take it.
   In Washington, FAA spokesman John Leyden said officials were
``working with Northwest and with the French authorities to ensure
there is extra security on the flight.''
   Pierre Quilici, deputy chief of France's Air and Border Police,
said U.S. authorities had passed on word of the threat several days
ago. He said most of the special security measures that will be
taken to protect the flight cannot be disclosed.
   ``I can say that the airplane will be guarded from its arrival
in Paris,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``We will reinforce
the controls on the passengers, the hand baggage and the checked
baggage.''
   The Northwest DC-10 is scheduled to arrive at Charles de Gaulle
airport Saturday morning on a flight from Detroit, then take off
again for Detroit in the afternoon.
   Quilici said precautions will be increased even from the
stepped-up levels instituted this month in response to a general
threat of a terrorist attack in France.
   The government announced in early December that security was
increased in French subway stations, railroad stations, airports,
department stores and border crossings, but did not say why a new
threat was perceived.
   Then on Dec. 19, officials announced new measures at French
airports, with manual searches of one of every 10 pieces of hand
luggage, X-rays of all checked baggage and hand searches of one out
of 20 pieces of checked baggage.
   In St. Paul, Miller said the FBI had asked the airline not to
disclose any other details about the threat, including where or
when it was made.
   ABC News, quoting sources, reported Thursday night that a man
with a ``Middle Eastern accent'' made the threat to Northwest's
Detroit office, saying the bombing would be in retaliation for life
sentences handed down to two Palestinians convicted in Sweden of
charges connected with a string of bombings in Europe.
   One of the two, Abu Mohammed Talb, is a suspect in the Flight
103 bombing. He and co-defendant Marten Imandi were sentenced to
life for their part in the 1985 bombing of a Northwest office in
Copenhagen that killed one person and wounded 20, one of four
bombings in Denmark and the Netherlands for which they were
convicted.

<HEAD>Father Finds Tape of Drug Deals in Recorder Intended as Christmas
Gift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A father hoping to surprise his children
with a tape recorder for Christmas got a surprise of his own _ the
device contained a tape of conversations involving drug dealing.
   An Indianapolis man purchased the recorder at a Wal-Mart store
in Plainfield Dec. 23, said Hendricks County Sheriff's Department
spokesman Lt. Stephen G. Golden.
   The man, whose identity was withheld, noticed the tape inside
the player and listened to it. He then turned the tape over to
authorities.
   The tape was made secretly by parents of a Bridgeport teen-ager
when they suspected their daughter was dealing drugs, Golden said.
The parents used a home recording device that began taping whenever
the phone was used.
   Investigators believe the girl learned of the recording and she
or her boyfriend took the tape to the store to play, leaving it in
a display model, Golden said.
   When the recorder was the only one left, employees boxed it and
sold it to the Indianapolis man, who took it home, Golden said.
   ``The guy was shocked because it was supposed to be a present
from Santa Claus'' to his children, said Golden.
   Detectives listened to the tape and have seven suspects to
question, Golden said. The tape is recorded so clearly that
detectives may be able to trace the telephone's touch-tone sounds.
   The tape describes plans by dealers to distribute illicit drugs
in at least three counties, Golden said.
   ``We've picked out first names and have figured out who these
people are,'' said Golden. ``We've identified several of them.''

   Police in riot gear fired tear gas into a
detention center today to quell unrest by Vietnamese boat people
who refused to cooperate in a search for homemade weapons.
Officials said 40 people were injured.
   Police found more than 700 weapons in the early afternoon search
and arrested 27 Vietnamese.
   The violence came a day after fights broke out between two
groups of Vietnamese in a second center. One person was killed and
10 injured in the clashes.
   Vietnamese at the Chi Ma Wan center threw stones and set fire to
blankets after security forces arrived for the weapons search,
government spokesman Timothy Li said.
   Television showed police equipped with helmets and shields
firing tear gas, and smoke from fires could be seen rising above
the center.
   Police said 14 Vietnamese and 26 guards and policemen were
injured in the camp on outlying Lantau Island.
   ``The boat people, in order to make the operation more
difficult, pushed their women and children to the front,'' Security
Secretary M. Geoffrey Barnes said in a government statement.
   Although officials refused to say how many police were used in
the operation, government-funded radio put the number at about 300.
   Five hours of counseling by staff of the U.N. High Commissioner
of Refugees and voluntary agencies failed to persuade the
Vietnamese to cooperate, the government statement said.
   The radio reported that the resistance may have been prompted by
reports that some of the Chi Ma Wan inmates may be in the next
group of boat people forced to return to their impoverished
homeland.
   That fatality occurred at the Shek Kong Detention Center late
Thursday when two fights broke out between two rival groups of
Vietnamese boat people armed with homemade weapons, police said.
   No one was arrested at Shek Kong but police found homemade
weapons such as swords and lances after the battles.
   Police say five people have died this year in factional fighting
in the crowded, squalid camps housing the boat people in this
British colony.
   The residents of both camps are among about 44,000 boat people
who have sailed into Hong Kong since mid-June 1988 and are
considered illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled
persecution.
   Hong Kong forcibly repatriated 51 boat people to Hanoi against
their will earlier this month and reports have said another group
will be forced home next month.
   Meanwhile, the eighth batch of boat people to volunteer to
return to their Communist homeland flew back to Hanoi today. The 72
men, 29 women and 10 children took a chartered flight. Their
departure brings to 874 the number of Vietnamese who have returned
home voluntarily since March.

<HEAD>Interior Ministry Proposes Creation of New Police Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Ministry today presented
plans to create an independent police force responsible for keeping
public order and protecting citizens as part of ongoing reforms in
the ministry, the PAP news agency said.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak outlined the proposals to
create a new force based on the present civic militia during a
meeting with President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the agency said.
   Regular police work such as controlling traffic and pursuing
criminals is now carried out by the civic militia, which in the
past was also responsible for represssing the opposition and
militant priests, bugging telephones and monitoring letters between
private citizens.
   Kiszczak told Jaruzelski that a name for the new police force
was still under discussion as is the design of new uniforms, the
state news agency reported.
   ``The police would be independent and would handle only tasks
concerning protection of public order and protection of
individual's security and their property,'' the agency said.
   Kiszczak, one of only four Communist ministers in the cabinet,
said that a new Office for the Protection of the State would be
created to oversee activities by the intelligence and
counter-intelligence services.
   Kiszczak told Jaruzelski that the Interior Ministry, which now
controls the civic militia, was conducting consultations with the
Solidarity-led government and members of Parliament about the
proposals.
   When the discussions are completed, Kiszczak said he would ask
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki to start procedures to present a
draft law on the new police force to parliament, PAP said.
   There are now about 1,250 crimes per 100,000 people annually,
but there are increasing incidents of car break-ins and other
crimes being reported as the economic situation in Poland worsens.
   The Interior Ministry has already taken dramatic steps to
improve its image that was tarnished during years of repression
against society.
   Just two weeks after Parliament approved the new Solidarity-led
government on Sept. 12, the Interior Ministry ordered the
disbanding of all units of the widely feared and despised
paramilitary ZOMO riot police.
   The helmeted squads, with shields and batons were a regular
feature at opposition demonstrations. They were replaced by
``special preventive patrol units.''
   The International Institute for Strategic Studies put the number
of ZOMO at 28,000.
   In October, the ministry also said it would disband the ``Fourth
Department'' which oversaw the activities of the clergy. Four
members of the Fourth Department were convicted of the 1984 murder
of Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a popular pro-Solidarity priest.
   The interior ministry also announced at the time that the secret
police would disband undercover units and turn off listening
devices.
   Parliament in November disbanded the 328,510-member paramilitary
volunteer police force, known as ORMO. Solidarity lawmakers called
the ORMO a ``relic of Stalinism.''

<TEXT>
   Holding back tears with her ``precautionary
Kleenex,'' Jane Pauley said farewell this morning after 13 years as
a co-host of NBC's ``Today'' program.
   She said ``1989 is a year nobody is likely to forget'' for
reasons other than a cast change of a television program, but added
that ``next year promises to be pretty interesting, too, and I'm
anxious to get on with it.''
   She promised to keep up friendships with each of her colleagues
on the show, Bryant Gumbel, Gene Shalit and her replacement,
Deborah Norville, as they said their goodbyes at the conclusion of
the last program of the year.
   Recalling Frank McGee, a former ``Today'' regular, Pauley said,
``Frank never said goodbye, but at least 1,000 times he said,
`Don't go far.'''
   Much of the final half-hour of the two-hour show was taken up
with highlights of Pauley's past, including clips of her changing
hairstyles since 1976, and the comments of an anthropologist on the
deeper meanings of her coiffure.
   Tom Brokaw, co-host for the first five years of Pauley's run,
said in a film clip that she was ``the young woman you'd like to
have as your daughter.''
   Weatherman Willard Scott summed her up as ``a class act.'' A
statistician said she'd logged 3,000 shows, conducted 12,000
interviews, asked 88,000 questions and traveled 200,000 miles for
the program.
   ``I look like Alice in Wonderland,'' a maturer and more assured
Pauley said after seeing a clip of her first appearance, Oct. 11,
1976, as she told viewers that ``one and a half years ago I was a
second-string news reader in Indianapolis. ...''
   Pauley became co-host of the top-rated network morning program
when she was 25, stepping into the shoes of the trail-blazing
Barbara Walters.
   Pauley has said her own decision to leave ``Today'' grew out of
her feeling that NBC News President Michael Gartner and NBC Sports
President Dick Ebersol, who also was overseer of ``Today,'' were
not thinking about her future.
   Ebersol said bringing in Norville and other changes were done to
``position the show for the '90s.''
   Pauley was seen in prime time on Wednesday, as co-host of ``The
Eighties'' retrospective with Tom Brokaw. Other prime-time
assignments are planned.

   Northwest Airlines says strict security
precautions ensure that a Paris-Detroit flight Saturday will
operate safely despite a bomb threat that today caused at least 30
passengers to cancel reservations.
   In an unusual public response to a bomb threat, the airline
announced Thursday that any passengers who do not wish to take
Flight 51 may postpone their flight or switch to other carriers
without penalty.
   At Northwest's Paris office, sales manager Frederic Wuatelet
said at least 30 passengers had changed reservation by midday
today. Earlier reports said between 120 and 130 passengers were
booked on the DC-10.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman John Leyden indicated
there was little unusual about the threat itself, which he said
came in an anonymous phone call and was one of about 300 received
by U.S. airlines each year.
   Leyden said officials were ``working with Northwest and with the
French authorities to ensure there is extra security on the
flight.''
   Northwest's public response was a departure from the handling of
most threats against U.S. aviation, which generally are dealt with
stealthily and not mentioned to passengers.
   The FAA and airlines have come under pressure to be more
forthright in disclosing security risks after 270 people were
killed Dec. 21, 1988, when a bomb blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland. The plane, which had stopped in London, was en
route from Frankfurt to New York. A threat against Pan Am on the
Frankfurt-to-New York route got some distribution within the U.S.
government but was not made public. Government officials later
declared the threat a hoax even though its particulars fit the Pan
Am explosion.
   The FAA has a policy of not alerting the public to security
threats unless they are very specific and the flight involved is
not being canceled.
   The Northwest threat appeared to meet conditions that would
allow disclosure.
   ``This is an unusual threat in the fact that it's very specific,
directed at a specific flight on a particular day, and that is what
adds to the precautions that we're taking surrounding it,'' said
Northwest spokesman Douglas Miller in St. Paul, Minn.
   Miller said Northwest informed the FAA, FBI, CIA and foreign
agencies that would be involved, but he said the FBI had asked the
airline not to disclose any other details about the threat,
including where or when it was made.
   ABC News, quoting sources, reported Thursday night that a man
with a ``Middle Eastern accent'' made the threat to Northwest's
Detroit office, saying the bombing would be in retaliation for life
sentences handed down to two Palestinians convicted in Sweden of
charges connected with a string of bombings in Europe.
   One of the two, Abu Mohammed Talb, is a suspect in the Flight
103 bombing. He and co-defendant Marten Imandi were sentenced to
life for their part in the 1985 bombing of a Northwest office in
Copenhagen that killed one person and wounded 20, one of four
bombings in Denmark and the Netherlands for which they were
convicted.
   The threat against Northwest has brought tightened security for
all Northwest flights out of Paris, Miller said.
   ``We intend to fly the plane,'' he said. ``We feel that we have
all the precautions and security measures in place to operate the
plane safely. If we did not feel 100 percent positive about our
ability to fly the plane safely, we would not put it in the air.''
   Miller said the airline had not decided whether to attempt to
advise passengers individually prior to their arrival for the
flight, but a statement noting the bomb threat would be handed to
those who go to the airport for departure Saturday.
   ``They can change their itineraries without penalty,'' he said.
Airlines regularly prohibit reservation changes or charge for them
when passengers fly on the least-expensive fares.
   Meanwhile, Northwest reservations clerks were advising callers
of a ``security threat'' against the flight.
   Callers were told they could change reservations to another day
or another flight on a different airline.
   In a related incident, a USAir flight preparing to take off from
Philadelphia International Airport for Boston on Thursday returned
to the gate after a ``security threat'' was conveyed to the crew,
an airline spokesman said early today.
   The threat was found to be unfounded after security personnel
searched the cabin of Flight 528, USAir spokesman John Bronson
said. The 127 passengers on board the plane, scheduled to depart at
5:55 p.m., were returned to the gate, put up for the night and were
to be flown to Boston today.

<HEAD>Dairy Price Support Going Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department announced today
that the federal price support for milk produced by farmers will be
reduced Jan. 1 to $10.10 per 100 pounds, a 50-cent cut from the
current level.
   Acting Secretary Roland R. Vautour said the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989 authorized a reduction of up to 50 cents
_ the maximum announced today _ if government purchases of surplus
dairy products are expected to exceed five billion pounds of milk
equivalent in 1990.
   If the support had remained at $10.60 per hundredweight, 1990
purchases by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. would have
totaled an estimated eight billion pounds, he said. With the
reduction to $10.10, purchases are expected to be 7.4 billion
pounds.
   Unlike price support operations for many other commodities, the
dairy program does not give farmers direct federal payments.
Instead, the CCC buys surplus cheese, not-fat dry milk and butter
so that processors and handlers can pay dairy farmers at least the
basic support rate for milk.
   The CCC purchase price of butter will be reduced 11.25 cents per
pound to $1.0925 per pound, the announcement said. Non-fat dry milk
will be unchanged at 79 cents per pound. The price of block cheddar
and barrel cheese will be reduced by 4.5 cents per pound to $1.11
and $1.07 per pound, respectively.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who is on vacation, had
been urged by the National Milk Producers Federation not to reduce
the 1990 milk support rate, contending that such a move would
``prove seriously destabilizing to the dairy industry.''

<HEAD>College Student's Death During Arrest Ruled a Homicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of a college student who died after
he was arrested outside a Grateful Dead rock concert was homicide
because he was choked while officers wrestled him down, coroner's
officials said.
   Patrick Shanahan, 19, of Fountain Valley was high on the
hallucinogenic drug LSD but died outside the concert in suburban
Inglewood earlier this month from ``compression of the neck during
restraint,'' according to a Los Angeles County coroner's autopsy
report released Thursday.
   ``It's not an accident, not a suicide, it's a homicide _ meaning
death at the hands of another,'' said coroner's investigator David
Campbell.
   The district attorney's office is investigating and there is a
possibility of criminal charges, spokesman Mike Botula said
Thursday.
   ``It might be that even though there was the death of a suspect
involved, the police may have acted properly,'' Botula said.
   Witnesses reported seeing Inglewood police officers beating
Shanahan with night sticks during his arrest after a Dec. 10
concert. The officers said they approached Shanahan because he was
crawling on his hands and knees and screaming.
   Inglewood police refused to comment on the coroner's ruling
Thursday. Previously, police denied that officers either struck
Shanahan or used excessive force, saying he resisted arrest and
probably died from a drug overdose.
   Shanahan, a student at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, stopped breathing after six officers placed him in a
patrol car, Inglewood police said. He was pronounced dead at a
hospital.

   A group claiming responsibility for bombs that
killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer threatened in a
letter full of racial invective to assassinate two NAACP officials
``as part of the same reprisal.''
   In a letter to WAGA-TV, an organization calling itself Americans
for a Competent Federal Judicial System also threatened to kill
lawyers, judges and members of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People ``any time a black man rapes a white
woman.''
   The threatened reprisals led black leaders to bolster security
plans for the Jan. 15 celebration of slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
   Precautions were being taken at the 600 southeastern branches of
the NAACP, said Earl Shinhoster, the organization's regional
director. He declined to say what those precautions were.
   An FBI official said he believed the letter was authentic
because it contained information available only to someone closely
associated with the construction and mailing of the bombs that
killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance at
his home near Birmingham, Ala., on Dec. 16 and Savannah attorney
Robert Robinson two days later.
   William L. Hinshaw, agent in charge of the FBI investigation,
would not specify what that information is.
   ``It opens a new door, and we hope through that door will pass
information from the public,'' he said.
   Authorities are unfamiliar with the group, Hinshaw said.
   The Atlanta Constitution, in today's editions, quoted
unidentified sources as saying the letter contained the same
identifying code as the previous letters and that physical evidence
links all of the letters to the bombs. The newspaper did not
elaborate.
   In its evening broadcasts Thursday, WAGA-TV released excerpts of
the letter, which said the group held a secret meeting Dec. 19 in
Montgomery, Ala., after the two fatal bombings.
   According to the station, the letter said group members from
Georgia, Florida and Alabama gathered ``to draft new orders'' and
to go public with their mission.
   The group claimed it ``assassinated Judge Robert S. Vance and
attorney Robert Robinson in reprisal for atrocities committed on
Julie Love,'' a white woman who was robbed, raped and murdered in
Atlanta in 1988.
   The letter also said: ``Two more prominent members of the NAACP
shall be assassinated, using more sophisticated means, as part of
the same reprisal.''
   The letter expressed anger over school desegregation cases,
apparently referring to a long-running battle over the DeKalb
County, Ga., schools in which the slain judge was involved.
   ``Protecting the innocent warrants a higher court priority than
granting the blacks' demand for white teachers for their
children,'' the letter said.
   Vance was on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court panel that directed
DeKalb schools to transfer about 120 veteran teachers from
predominantly white schools to predominantly black ones in an
effort to balance teacher experience in the system.
   Robinson handled a desegregation case in Savannah, and another
school desegregation case came out of Jacksonville, Fla., where a
bomb was delivered to NAACP headquarters. That bomb and one sent to
the 11th Circuit building in Atlanta were safely removed.
   ``Anytime a black man rapes a white woman in Alabama, Florida or
Georgia in the future, Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial
System shall assassinate one federal judge, one attorney and one
officer of the NAACP,'' the letter said.
   It cited the slaying of Ms. Love, 27, who disappeared July 11,
1988, after her car ran out of gas. Her remains were found a little
more than a year later, in a wooded lot near an inner-city
neighborhood.
   Two young black men _ Emmanuel Fitzgerald Hammond, 24, and
William Maurice Porter, 20 _ have been charged in the slaying.
Porter pleaded guilty in November and is expected to testify
against Hammond.
   ``It's very difficult to react,'' the NAACP's Shinhoster said.
``The threats against the NAACP and others contained in that
communication must be taken seriously. We've already had two
decent, fine individuals murdered by that group.''
   Walter Morrison, a spokesman at the NAACP's Baltimore
headquarters, said the group wasn't intimidated by the action.
   ``We've indicated that we will not be deterred,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. troops arrested an Israeli
intelligence expert and five other close aides to Manuel Antonio
Noriega, U.S. sources said. The Vatican today said it was urging
Noriega to leave its embassy.
   The deposed military leader was holed up in the embassy with 17
others.
   For the first time since the U.S. invasion Dec. 20, U.S. sources
said there was no shooting overnight.
   Newspapers in Panama City today ran advertisements asking people
to bring back looted merchandise, offering rewards with no
questions asked. In other ads, companies such as Kodak said
warranties would not apply to looted items.
   Army Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia, a U.S. military spokesman, said
Noriega's chief economic adviser and his personal physician were
detained within the past 24 hours.
   Angel Mina, Noriega's economic chief, was detained trying to
leave the country, Murguia said today. Murguia also said that Dr.
Sosa, whose first name was not available, was caught while trying
to enter the Cuban Embassy.
   U.S. troops arrested Michel Harari, a former Israeli
intelligence agent and top security adviser to Noriega who was an
instructor for Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces, a U.S. Embassy
officical said Thursday on condition of anonymity.
   Lt. Col. Roberto Cedeno, chief of Noriega's state security
intelligence, also was detained.
   Harari and Cedeno were not previously in the Vatican embassy but
it was not known where they were arrested.
   Two more top aides, Lt. Col. Carlos Velardes and Lt. Col.
Arnulfo Castrejon, left the embassy and were taken into custody by
U.S. troops, said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia.
   Velardes was chaplain of the Defense Forces, and Castrejon was
the officer on duty at Noriega's military headquarters on Dec. 16,
the day an unarmed U.S. Marine officer was killed nearby.
   They are among more than 4,000 people being held without
charges, U.S. sources have said.
   The Vatican for the first time today said publicly it was trying
to persuade Noriega to leave.
   ``The nuncio is doing his best to convince Gen. Noriega to
abandon the nunciature on his own, by himself,'' spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said in Rome. ``At the same time he cannot force Noriega to
leave nor can he consign him to U.S forces.''
   Navarro said the possibility had been discussed with Noriega
since he took refuge at the mission on Sunday.
   A Panamanian official said Endara's government sent a letter to
the Vatican asking that Noriega be expelled from the embassy, where
he sought refuge on Sunday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did
not know whether the government asked that Noriega be turned over
to U.S. authorities or to Panama.
   Navarro today said the Vatican has received no formal request.
He also said ``steps'' would be taken if the United States kept up
harassment of itw embassy in Panama.
   U.S. troops ringing the embassy with tanks and armored vehicles
continued to blast heavy metal and rock music all night and today.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater suggested it was designed to
foil eavesdropping on any negotiations at the palm-studded
diplomatic compound.
   But the music also seemed intended to grate on Noriega's nerves.
The playlist included ``You're No Good,'' ``Nowhere to Run, Nowhere
to Hide,'' and ``Voodoo Child.''
   ``They should keep it up. To see if Noriega gets fed up and
leaves,'' said one neighborhood resident, Guadalupe Warner.
   Many residents have had their pictures taken with soldiers and
some make several trips a day to feed the Americans.
   The Rev. Javier Villanueva, a parish priest helping the papal
nuncio, said among the 17 people staying in the embassy with
Noriega were Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, chief of Noriega's
investigations department, and Capt. Eliezer Gaytan, chief of
security.
   He said four members of the Basque separatist group ETA, along
with one of their wives, also had taken shelter there as a
precaution. They were in exile in Panama as part of an agreement
with the Spanish government, Villanueva said.
   He refused to identify the 10 others staying at the embassy.
   On Thursday, U.S. troops stopped a car carrying Cuban Ambassador
Lazaro Mora and a companion for inspection and briefly prevented
the companion from entering the ambassador's residence because he
wasn't carrying the proper identification, a U.S. Embassy spokesman
said. The companion got the identification and was later admitted,
said the spokesman, William Barr.
   Also Thursday, the U.S. diplomat said that the 14,000 U.S.
troops sent in the invasion would remain at least through February
while local security forces are reconstituted. He also acknowledged
there was concern about holdovers from the Noriega regime.
   About 12,000 U.S. troops are permanently stationed in Panama.
   In Texas, where President Bush was hunting, Fitzwater reiterated
the U.S. stance that Noriega should be handed over to the United
States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges.
   Endara, whose government appeared to falter at first, received
another boost Thursday when the pro-Noriega Labor Party recognized
his government.
   Party leader Ramon Sieiro, a brother-in-law of Noriega's, read a
statement acknowledging Endara's victory in the May 7 balloting
that Noriega annulled. Sieiro was a vice presidential candidate on
the pro-Noriega coalition ticket in the election.
   Twenty-three American servicemen and two dependents were killed
and 322 Americans were wounded during the invasion, according to
the Southern Command. It said 297 Panamanians troops were killed
and 123 wounded.
   The U.S. Embassy official said about 300 Panamanian civilians
died in the fighting. He said reports of large numbers of uncounted
civilian casualties were unfounded.

<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel, the passionate
defender of human rights and eloquent philosopher of moral
resistance, was in jail just nine months ago for challenging the
Communist masters.
   On Friday, he was elected president of Czechoslovakia.
   The spontaneous revolution that carried Havel to the highest
post in the land could not have been more perfectly scripted if it
had been plotted by the 53-year-old playwright himself.
   One year to the day from Czechoslovakia's first legal
demonstration for human rights, the Communists lost their monopoly
on power.
   The appointment of the new reform government on Dec. 10 and the
simultaneous resignation of hard-line Communist President Gustav
Husak followed four weeks of mass pro-democracy protests and days
of negotiations between the Communists and the opposition, led by
Havel.
   Although sparked by the violent police crackdown on peaceful
student demonstrators Nov. 17, the revolution that toppled the
Communists was achieved without violence. Its weapon was the
enormous moral force which Havel has come to symbolize.
   The upheaval cast Havel into the leading role as head of the
opposition Civic Forum. But long before, he embodied for many
Czechoslovaks the individual's struggle for human dignity under
Communism.
   His trouble with authorities began in the Stalinist 1950s when
he was declared too bourgeois to attend high school because he came
from a family of well-known architects and entrepreneurs in
pre-Communist Czechoslovakia.
   He went to work in the theater where his play ``The Garden
Party'' brought him instant success in 1963.
   His essays, letters and manifestoes were a relentless attack
against tyranny. In his 1978 essay, ``The Power and The
Powerless,'' Havel powerfully describes how the Communist regimes
of the Soviet bloc sought to strangle independent thought.
   His unbending defense of liberty, which included signing the
human rights manifesto Charter 77, earned him a four-year jail
sentence in 1979.
   Even after release Havel was hounded, interrogated and followed
by secret police. His works were published and performed to wide
acclaim in the West and despite an official ban, his ideas
circulated at home through smuggled books and underground journals
and his popularity grew.
   Havel's work, especially the rich, poetic philosophical
meditations of his political essays, made him one of the leading
spokesmen for East European intellectuals.
   In an interview published in May by The Observer in London,
Havel reflected on the unique role of the writer under
totalitarianism.
   ``Where society cannot organize itself naturally and where
politics in the original sense of the word have been abolished,
everything becomes crypto-political or semi-political. Politics are
thrown out the door only to come back through the window,'' he said.
   ``Abolished as a specific form of activity, politics spread to
encompass a wide range of other pursuits.
   ``Everything from a rock group to a concert to a religious Mass
can become political. If a writer attempts to speak the truth all
his life, he too becomes a political phenomenon,'' he said.
   Havel's election _ becoming the first non-Communist president in
41 years _ revives Czechoslovakia's tradition of the philosopher
president dating to Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, the professor and
author who built the nation from the rubble of the Austro-Hungarian
empire in 1918.
   His countrymen look to Havel to create stability after the
recent upheaval and to encourage investment from the West.
   Havel sees his role as director, guiding the nation toward its
first free elections in 41 years.
   He has said he envisions a ``modern contemporary system which
would return to people their honor and freedom.''
   ``Politics really should be ethics put into practice,'' he has
said.
   After the first free multi-party parliamentary elections next
year, he would like to return to writing, leaving the nation in the
hands of a president elected by a new Parliament to serve a full
five-year term.
   In a letter written from his cell to Olga, his wife of 30 years,
and published in the collected ``Letters to Olga,'' he described
with his usual clarity the motivation which drives him today.
   ``There are times,'' he wrote, ``when an artist must put his art
aside in order to do something positive in life, something modest
that may not earn him a place in history but which is the
expression of a moral imperative or simply a love for people.''
   Czechoslovaks standing beneath the balcony of the presidential
castle looked up to Havel Friday and returned that love.

   The Vatican should put the fate of ousted
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega in the hands of a special public
tribunal, a group of American scholars suggested.
   In a statement transmitted this week to the Vatican, nine U.S.
legal experts and academicians said turning Noriega over to a
``grand-jury-type panel'' would set a positive precedent in
international criminal law for handling deposed dictators accused
of criminal activity.
   The panel should be made up of ``distinguished persons publicly
known to be of high integrity and fair-mindedness, selected by
yourselves and others, including the secretary general of the
United Nations,'' the statement said.
   Noriega has been holed up in the Vatican embassy in Panama City
since Sunday. Both U.S. and Panamanian officials have urged the
Vatican to turn him over for trial on drug-trafficking charges.
   Alfred F. Andersen, a self-described retired philosopher and
author who lives in Tucson, said in a telephone interview Thursday
that he and the eight others who signed the document believe it
would be a mistake for the Vatican simply to hand Noriega over to
the United States.
   ``We, the undersigned, commend your not making a hasty decision
in this matter, and your evidently wanting to be sure that your
ultimate decision will truly serve the cause of justice in this
turbulent world,'' the statement said
   Andersen said the statement was his idea.
   ``I saw the dilemma the Vatican was in,'' Andersen said. ``I
started thinking about how he could be turned over to someone who
would be more objective than the United States or even the
Panamanian government.''
   Andersen said he contacted a friend, Richard A. Falk, a
Princeton University international law professor, and the two of
them worked out the statement.
   Andersen said he and Falk then contacted the others whose names
appear on the document transmitted to the Vatican Wednesday night
and again on Thursday.
   The Vatican has yet to respond, Andersen said.
   In addition to himself and Falk, Andersen said the statement
also was signed by Benjamin B. Ferenca, a prosecutor at the
Nuremberg trials following World War II, who now lives in New
Rochelle, N.Y.; Burns H. Weston, a University of Iowa law
professor; Stephen Cary, retired vice president of Haverford
College, Haverford, Penn.; Hazel Henderson, an author, St.
Augustine, Fla.; Gerald Mische, president of Global Education
Associates, New York; and Saul Mendlovitz, director of World Order
Models Project, New York.

<HEAD>Burmese Troops Seize Major Rebel Base on Thai Frontier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burmese forces backed by more than 800
rounds of mortar fire today captured a major Karen rebel base on
the Thai border, Thai border patrol police said. Dozens were
reported killed.
   The border police said a force of as many as 3,000 Burmese
soldiers fought hundreds of rebels for four days before overrunning
the camp at Pa Loo, about 10 miles southwest of the Thai border
town of Mae Sot.
   Rebel sources said hundreds of government troops were killed and
wounded in the attack.
   In Rangoon, the government spokesman, Kyaw Sann, claimed 50
rebels were killed in the victory. He said 22 government troops
were killed and 52 wounded.
   The Burmese had launched a simultaneous but unsuccessful attack
on the nearby rebel base of Kaw Moo Ra, said the Thai police on
condition of anonymity.
   The Karens, one of the largest of the diverse ethnic groups
fighting the Burmese government, have resisted the integration of
the Karen state into the Union of Burma since Rangoon gained
independence from Britain in 1948.
   Thai border police said that during the final attack, 600
Burmese troops crossed the Moei River into the Thai village of Ban
Mae Kon Kaen to attack Pa Loo from the rear, while most of the 700
defenders were positioned at the front of the camp, they said.
   At least 800 mortar rounds were fired at Pa Loo overnight and at
least 20 fell into Ban Mae Kon Kaen, the police said.
   During the fighting, some 500 to 600 Karen fighters fled into
Thailand before moving back across the border to another Karen base
farther south, they said.
   The rebel sources claimed that up to 300 Burmese troops had been
killed and another 100 wounded since Tuesday. Even more were killed
in the final assault, they claimed.
   Rebel casualties today were 20 killed and 13 wounded, they
claimed.
   Htay Tin, a leader of the All Burma Student's Democratic Front,
which fights alongside the Karens, said 50 students were thought to
have been captured.
   Thousands of Burmese students fled to join the rebels after the
military brutally crushed a nationwide uprising for democracy in
1988.

   The judge injured by a package of pipe
bombs has no idea who mailed him the explosives and says he was
surprised to have survived what he is calls a violent attack on the
entire Maryland bench.
   ``There is no way I should have survived. No way I should be
alive,'' Washington County Circuit Judge John P. Corderman said in
an interview published today by The Sun in Baltimore.
   Corderman arrived home at his apartment in downtown Hagerstown
on Dec. 22 and found a package leaning against his door. He took it
inside, opened it and it exploded. The judge suffered shrapnel
wounds to his right hand and abdomen and partial hearing loss.
   Corderman said that although ``it was a personal attack on me,
it has a larger dimension. It is an attack on the system I serve.''
   ``In a way, I represent the 200 judges at the trial and
appellate level in Maryland,'' he said.
   ``I am deeply disturbed by the level of violence that seems to
go unabated in our society,'' he added.
   Doctors at Washington County Hospital removed pieces of pipe
from his left groin and reconstructed the middle finger on his
right hand. The explosion punctured his eardrums and, before
releasing him Christmas Day, doctors told the 47-year-old judge
that he might need corrective ear surgery.
   ``It was the most remarkable Christmas I've ever had in the best
possible way,'' Corderman told The Sun. ``Some of the presents
weren't wrapped and that was OK. Some of the cards didn't make it,
and that was OK.
   ``Because I had the gift of life, that made everything material
pale in comparison.''
   Corderman has been helping postal inspectors and detectives try
to make a list of possible suspects. Inspectors continue to examine
hundreds of Corderman's cases looking for potential suspects.
   ``Unfortunately, this judge is very controversial,'' said Postal
Inspector Don Gattie. ``He sentences 150 cases a year and that's
just criminal.''
   Gattie, who said investigators were not close to making an
arrest, said Corderman also handled child support cases and had a
reputation for issuing harsh sentences against parents who failed
to pay and also in cases involving drugs or alcohol.
   ``They are portraying me as tough, but I give people a chance
all the time,'' he said. ``I modify sentences all the time. I give
people a chance to take a diferent path.''
   Gattie said investigators received a couple dozen calls on a tip
line the Postal Service set up in Hagerstown.
   Investigators with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms have completed their preliminary forensic investigation of
bomb fragments.
   ``There were at least three pipe bombs, one of which did not
explode and was deactivated by the bomb squad,'' said Tom Hill, an
ATF spokesman.
   WRC-TV in Washington quoted unidentified investigators as saying
there were four bombs in the package and that three exploded.
   Federal investigators, however, have refused to confirm the
report. ``We don't want to inform the doer how we're doing,'' said
Jack Killorin, an ATF spokesman in Washington.
   Killorin said the investigation still was focused in Maryland.
   Mike Vision, a spokesman for the postal inspection service in
Baltimore, said he knew where the package was mailed but refused to
divulge information about the postmark.

   When the New Year arrives, so will a gallant
masked figure from the past of old Spanish California. With sword
flashing, black cape billowing, white teeth gleaming, here comes
... Zorro?
   Yes, by neddies. Zorro. With a Z. It's the latest in a long line
of Zorros that includes the ABC series of 1957-59 that set millions
of tykes to running about in Zorro costumes, trying to puncture
each other in the name of justice.
   That one starred Guy Williams. This one, starring Duncan Regehr,
36, is the first new ``Zorro'' series ever on cable, specifically
the Family Channel, where the half-hour series will debut on Jan. 5.
   The show's star, a Canadian with Shakespearean stage credits, is
a very big Zorro. He stands 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 215
pounds. Were this a ``Zorro'' of fistics, not fencing, he'd be
right at home.
   This is because Regehr, a soft-spoken man with a dry sense of
humor, regularly used to put his dukes for sport. He once thought
of seeking a spot on Canada's Olympic boxing team. He fought 65
amateur bouts, he says, and had only three losses, none of them by
knockouts.
   It did enter his mind that a flattened nose might be bad for
someone seeking work as the handsome leading man in a work by
Shakespeare. ``That's why it was kind of dumb idea, don't you
think?'' he wryly asks.
   But that was when he was in his late teens, when the notion that
he could get his face rearranged had not quite sunk in: ``No, at
that age I think I was so stupid and cocky that I figured it
wouldn't happen to me.
   ``And fortunately I got out before it did. I hope.''
   Regehr's dossier includes such varied work as ``Hamlet'' at
Ontario's Stratford Shakespeare Festival and the role of the late
Erroll Flynn in CBS' ``My Wicked, Wicked Ways.''
   He shot 25 ``Zorro'' episodes in Spain this fall.
   The new series takes place, as have most `Zorro'' films, in
California in 1820. Regehr has, as have others before him, a
two-role part _ the dandy Don Diego Vega who really is the masked
Senor Zorro who zips about righting wrongs and leaving his
trademark ``Z'' carved in various places.
   George Hamilton played things for laughs _ and with a gay
look-alike brother _ in 1981's ``Zorro, The Gay Blade.'' So did CBS
in 1983 with a contemporary ``Zorro and Son,'' which was the sort
of show in which a Franciscan monk was arrested for ``selling wine
before its time.''
   But in this edition, done in the old romantic tradition, Don
Diego, usually played as a popinjay or even a fop, doesn't get that
treatment from Regehr:
   ``I've played hm more like a Renaissance man, interested in art,
science and music, more bookish rather than being, er, a little
light on the feet.''
   The actor, the son of an artist and a painter himself, has lived
for the past ten years in Los Angeles. But he and his wife,
Catherine, have a New Year's project _ to move to Vancouver Island
in British Columbia.
   He would keep a place in Los Angeles and commute there for film
and TV work, he says. But he no longer wants to call it home. ``I
did sort of like it 10 years ago, when it wasn't as crowded or
smog-filled,'' he says.
   Not now. And he has found that there is such a thing as too much
mellow, of which there is said to be a lot in Hollywood.
   In the old days, Regehr says, ``I could deal with the people
there, the `laid-backness.' Now, I don't know. It just seems too
relaxed to me.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   `STALIN'S GHOST' ON NBC _ On Dec. 31, NBC is airing a one-hour
news special, ``Stalin's Ghost,'' at 10 a.m. EST. It's about the
legacy of death and repression by the late Soviet leader, and the
Stalinists who seek to turn back the reforms and liberalization of
the Gorbachev era.

<HEAD>26,000 Indonesians To Be Sent Home to Obtain Proper Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malaysian authorities today began
ferrying 26,000 illegal immigrants home to obtain proper documents
so they can return here to work.
   Director General of Immigration Syed Alwi Syed Nordin was at
Malacca port, 90 miles southwest of Kuala Lumpur, to send off the
first batch of 76 Indonesians.
   It will take the government about a year to send back all 26,000
Indonesian illegal immigrants registered with his department, the
national news agency Bernama quoted him as telling reporters there.
An average of 500 will be sent back weekly across the Malacca
Straits, he added.
   Most will be sent to Dumai, on Indonesia's Sumatra Island, where
it would take two days for them to obtain valid Indonesian travel
documents, he said. The first batch was expected back Sunday in
Malacca.
   On their return, they were to be issued Malaysian visas and
three-year work permits, which could be renewed if necessary.
   Syed said that to keep track of the Indonesian workers in
Malaysia, the government had urged them to register with the
authorities so that they could be issued legal documents. The
Indonesian government had been consulted and agreed to this, he
added.
   The 26,000 who have registered mostly worked on palm oil, rubber
and other plantations.

   A peace march by about 3,000 European, Israeli
and Palestinian women ended today in a violent confrontation with
police after an outlawed Palestinian flag was raised in protest.
   Police said 16 women were detained, most of them Palestinians.
Police sprayed the area with tear gas, and reporters saw women
kicked, struck with nightsticks and dragged to police wagons.
   One women shouted ``Peace! Peace! Peace!'' as police dragged her
by her hair.
   Among those detained was Dacia Valent, an Italian citizen who is
a member of the European Parliament. She was taken into custody
after protesting the arrests to police.
   The women's peace march, which wound through city streets from
Jewish west Jerusalem to Arab east Jerusalem, was one of several
major events planned to precede Saturday's ``human chain'' around
the old, walled city.
   Police moved in to disperse the demonstrators after a
Palestinian flag was raised in the courtyard of a theater in east
Jerusalem.
   It was unclear who raised the flag, but Palestinian women in the
courtyard immediately took up chanting ``Israel No, PLO!'' and
other anti-Israeli slogans.
   This morning, soldiers set up checkpoints on roads from the West
Bank, increasing rally organizers' fears that the army intended to
block Palestinians from joining with Israelis and the 1,200
Europeans in Saturday's ``human chain.''
   Authorities have denied visas, barred visits to Palestinian
refugee camps and blocked tour buses from traveling to West Bank
cities.
   Army spokesmen said the checkpoints were not intended to close
off the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, they have refused
comment on Israeli news reports they will do so Saturday.
   Organizers of the ``1990 _ Time for Peace'' rally say their goal
is to foster dialogue between Arabs and Jews.
   ``We have emphasized that we are here to support the peace
voices on both sides,'' said Chiara Ingrao, an organizer from the
Italian Peace Association.
   Israeli officials said, however, that they fear the activists'
visit could spark more violence in the 2-year-old Palestinian
uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   ``The army frowns on people trying to make political statements,
especially those who are not citizens of the country, in the
territories,'' said one army official, who insisted on anonymity.
   The activists' vision of peace is at odds with the Israeli
government's view on three points; the activists call for
negotiations with the PLO, an international Middle East peace
conference and establishment of a Palestinian state alongside
Israel.
   Janet Aviad, a spokeswoman for the Israeli group Peace Now, a
sponsor of the rally, said the government is ``afraid of European
pressure and American pressure, and this event covered by the press
has potential for international pressure.''
   The Europeans include about 900 from Italy and smaller
delegations from Great Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and
Switzerland, as well as some Palestinian-Americans. Other sponsors
include groups from Italy, Holland and Britain, and local
Palestinian activists.
   Late Wednesday night, police searched the corridors of the
Europeans' headquarters hotel. Police spokesman Avi Zelba said the
searches ``in principle were not related to their visit'' but were
aimed at apprehending a wanted Palestinian.
   Israel radio reported Thursday that Moslem fundamentalists from
the Islamic Jihad group issued threats in Sweden and Italy for
people not to participate in a rally that encouraged Jewish-Arab
cooperation.
   However, rally organizers issued a statement saying they
consider the threats ``untrustworthy and unfounded.''

<HEAD>Glemp Wishes Lawmakers Strength During First Parliament Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Primate Jozef Glemp today paid tribute to
lawmakers of all political persuasions during the first visit by a
Poland's Roman Catholic leader to Parliament in the country's
postwar history.
   Lawmakers greeted Glemp with Christmas carols. His visit was
another sign of the changes in Poland's government since
Solidarity-backed candidates trounced Communist parliamentary
candidates and joined with other parties to form the East bloc's
first government led by non-Communists.
   Similar changes occurred in recent months in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia, and democratic reforms have spread through
Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.
   Glemp met with senators and members of the Sejm, as the lower
house of Parliament is called, during a break in a heated debate
over amendments to the constitution and an eventual change in the
country's national emblem.
   ``I wish you enough strength for the coming year and that the
link between the nation and the Parliament will become stronger and
meet with greater understanding,'' he said.
   Throughout the morning, lawmakers debated the constitutional
amendments, especially one that would eliminate a clause giving the
Communist Party the leading role in state affairs as well as a
proposed change that would add a crown to the national emblem.
   The package of constitutional amendments would also restore the
historical name of the country to the prewar Republic of Poland
instead of the Communist-imposed People's Republic of Poland.
   ``We shall soon say goodbye to 1989,'' said Edward Rzepa, a
deputy from the Solidarity caucus. ``It seems it is the most
appropriate moment to give society a long-expected gift _ a new
constitution.''
   The constitutional amendments, proposed by the Solidarity
caucus, are designed to eliminate or change sections inconsistent
with new democratic reforms until a completely new constitution can
be written.

<HEAD>Judge Indicted on Charges He Stole About $1.8 Million from Clients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former state judge has been indicted on
charges that he stole about $1.8 million from clients of his law
practice, the attorney general's office announced today.
   John Fairbanks was named in four counts in an indictment
returned Thursday, and Sullivan County Superior Court issued a
warrant for Fairbanks' arrest.
   Assistant Attorney General John Davis said Fairbanks'
whereabouts were unknown, but his lawyer was trying to get him to
surrender.
   Fairbanks resigned in June as a judge in Newport District Court
after more than 30 years on the bench, and he also tried to resign
from the state bar. However, the state Supreme Court would not
accept his resignation in order to retain disciplinary
jurisdiction, and instead suspended him from practicing law.
   The indictment alleges that Fairbanks, 66, stole the money
between December 1983 and last April from his private law clients,
from beneficiaries of trusts for which he was trustee and from
heirs of estates for which he was executor, Davis said.
   Each offense is punishment by 7{-to-15 years in prison.
   Fairbanks has refused to reveal his assets or comment on the
case.
   The Attorney General's office has investigated allegations
against Fairbanks for almost a year.
   Four of his former clients filed an involuntary bankruptcy
petition against Fairbanks on Sept. 27, accusing him of ``fraud,
theft, embezzlement or larceny'' of more than $500,000 entrusted to
him in his law practice.
   Four other ex-clients have lawsuits pending, alleging he misused
about $628,000 they entrusted to him.
   Three of his sisters also have accused him of mismanaging the
Bess Fairbanks Trust, named after their mother. They were
beneficiaries of the trust, while Fairbanks served as trustee and
controlled its stock and cash, valued at $500,000 in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's Turkish minority will be
allowed to adopt the Moslem names they were forced to change in an
often violent campaign starting in the early 1980s, a senior
official announced today.
   National Assembly Chairman Stanko Todorov, stepping out of
Parliament to meet demonstrating Turks, told the crowd that in
future ``everybody in Bulgaria will be able to choose his name,
religion and language freely.''
   There was consensus among the demonstrators and observers that
the crucial decision was made at a meeting of the Central Committee
of Bulgaria's ruling Communist Party. The Communists convened
earlier in the day to consider growing opposition demands for
speeding up democratic reforms in the country.
   The name change campaign, which gathered momentum in 1984,
affected hundreds of thousands of people, including Pomaks, or
Moslem Slavs, living in southern Bulgaria.
   Meanwhile, about 2,000 journalists gathered in front of the
party headquarters demanding freedom of the press.
   At that rally, a Moslem speaker told them that the first birth
certificate with a Moslem name in the past 10 years, that of
1-month-old Osman Bajram Husseinov, had just been issued by the
municipal registrar's office.
   The forced name change and increasing curbs on ethnic and
religious rights of the 1.5-million-strong Turkish minority earlier
this year prompted more than 300,000 to emigrate to Turkey after
Bulgarian authorities gave them passports.
   The hastily convened plenary meeting of the Central Committee
also planned to discuss further ``high level cadre changes'' in the
party and state hierarchy, as well as demands by Bulgarian Moslems
for an end to official persecution, sources close to the Communist
leadership said.
   On Thursday, about 10,000 people rallied in a city park to hear
leaders of an independent trade union demand a faster pace for
reform that was promised after hard-line Communist leader Todor
Zhivkov was ousted last month.
   ``Political pluralism, access to the media and ... ethnic
problems are among some of the topics we will raise with the
authorities'' at the talks, Podkrepa head Konstantin Trenchev told
the cheering crowd.
   At a second rally in Sofia, thousands of ethnic Turks and other
Moslems demonstrated against government persecution and also
demanded more democracy.
   The gatherings came one day after the ruling Communist Party
Politburo agreed to talks with the opposition beginning Wednesday.
   Podkrepa is one of several opposition groups that has been
allowed to function publicly since Zhivkov was forced from power
Nov. 10. The new Communist leadership has agreed to pursue reform,
but dissidents say the changes have been slow.
   The reform movement gained impetus after police violently broke
up an Oct. 26 demonstration called by the environmental group
Eco-Glasnost. Two weeks later, hard-liner Zhivkov was driven from
power by more reform-oriented Communists.
   Eco-Glasnost spokesman Deyan Kyuranov said at the rally that he
was convinced that pressure from opposition groups was instrumental
in Wednesday's ouster of Interior Minister Georgi Tanev.
   Tanev was fired for ordering the police attack on demonstrators.
   Kyuranov said the Union of Democratic Forces, an umbrella
organization of opposition groups, also would press for the removal
of Sofia Mayor Stefan Ninov, whom they also held accountable for
the crackdown.
   Kyuranov described the scheduling of talks as ``a significant
victory.'' ``Despite the fact that the government was inclined to
eventually stage such a discussion, the threat of a general strike
by the Podkrepa independent trade union forced their hand,'' he
said.
   The unofficial trade union had plans for a general strike
Thursday but called it off ``to respect the government's goodwill''
after authorities said they would hold talks.
   ``We would like to produce a binding document whose topics would
include free elections and human rights,'' Kyuranov said.
   Earlier, a crowd of more than 5,000 Turks and Pomaks, ethnic
Bulgarian Moslems, marched through the capital chanting
``Democracy!'' and ``We want our names back!''
   Bulgarian Communist authorities forced hundreds of thousands of
Pomaks to change their Moslem names into Bulgarian-sounding names
in a campaign that began in 1984.
   ``We also want to know who was responsible for the atrocities
committed in that campaign,'' according to a demonstrator who
identified himself only as Mehmed.
   The mere existence of the demonstrations is evidence of the
changes in Bulgaria, where any form of dissent was often brutally
suppressed. All other nations in the Soviet alliance have embraced
reform to varying degrees this year.

<HEAD>Department Acknowledges Oversight In Drawing Up Noriega Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department acknowledged today it
failed to follow its own guidelines for considering national
security problems when it brought drug charges against Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``It now appears that there was some rush to draw up the Noriega
indictment'' and guidelines requiring a review of national security
implications ``may not have been completely followed,'' spokesman
David Runkel told reporters.
   He added, however, ``We believe there is a strong case against
General Noriega and that case can be successfully brought to
trial.''
   In making the statement, Runkel backed away from his assertion
on Tuesday that concerns about the disclosure of state secrets in
the Noriega case ``have been grossly exaggerated.''
   He said national security issues in the case are being or will
soon be reviewed by prosecutors in the case and their departmental
supervisors.
   Noriega was ousted as Panama's ruler in a U.S. military invasion
Dec. 20 but has found shelter at the Vatican's embassy in Panama
City. A major goal of the operation was to return him to the United
States for trial on the drug charges.
   Runkel said the Justice Department policy that may have been
overlooked requires that when drawing up indictments on matters
involving national security, ``those issues be reviewed prior to or
during the process of drawing up the indictment.''
   He said such a review would include examination by prosecutors
of classified documents.
   ``I had been informed that that was the policy that had, in
fact, been followed in this case,'' Runkel said, adding that this
no longer appeared to be the case.
   He declined to elaborate on the nature of the ``rush'' to draw
up the indictment, saying, ``I haven't determined the reason'' for
it.
   Runkel said the department's decision to review the national
security issues was an outgrowth of a Dec. 14 meeting of
prosecutors in the case with representatives of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, FBI and CIA.
   He said the meeting was called to discuss drug-trafficking
indictments returned in 1988 against Noriega in Miami and Tampa,
Fla., and a decision was made to proceed with the Miami case.
   The Washington Post today quoted Richard D. Gregorie, who
directed the federal grand jury investigation in Miami that led to
one of the indictments, as saying he was never allowed to review
all the pertinent CIA files on Noriega.
   Runkel said Gregorie's statements were also a factor in the
Justice Department's decision to review the matter.
   Concerns about disclosure of secrets in the Noriega case have
arisen from reports that he worked closely with the CIA and the
Pentagon while he served as the head of Panama's military
intelligence service and after he became commander-in-chief in 1983.

   Prosecutors investigating the fatal shooting of a
pregnant woman and the wounding of her husband as they left a
birthing class at a city hospital two months ago have confirmed
that a police lineup took place.
   Charles Stuart, whose wife and prematurely born son died as a
result of the shooting, viewed several suspects Thursday, a source
in the prosecutor's office said today.
   Prosecutors and police refused to speak on the record, and would
not comment on the outcome of the lineup, citing an ongoing grand
jury investigation.
   Several Boston media outlets, quoting unnamed sources, reported
that Stuart identified William ``Willie'' Bennett, a suspect in the
case, in the lineup. Bennett is being held on a robbery charge but
has not been charged in the Stuart case. His lawyer, Robert
Sheketoff, was not in his office this morning.
   Stuart, who suffered a gunshot wound in the stomach, left the
hospital earlier this month. His wife, Carol, died of her wounds,
and their son, Christopher, born several hours after the shooting,
died a few weeks later.

   Herman Short, a former Houston police chief who
gained a national reputation as a law-and-order hard-liner, has
died after suffering a lengthy heart ailment. He was 71.
   Short, who served as chief from 1964 to 1973, evoked the ire of
civil rights leaders in the late 1960s for his handling of racial
disturbances, but supporters said his tough stance in the face of
rioting prevented Houston from faring far worse.
   He once was mentioned as a potential running mate for 1968
conservative presidential candidate George Wallace.
   Short resigned on the eve of the inauguration of former Mayor
Fred Hofheinz, who planned to fire the chief the moment he took
office.
   ``We were essentially an all-white police department under
Herman that believed in heavy-handed tactics'' that included the
use of illegal wiretaps, Hofheinz said Thursday.
   Wiretapping indictments were returned against officers who had
served under Short, but he was never charged with wrongdoing.
   ``Certainly we made mistakes as does everyone, but I never ruled
in any way except in accordance with the rules,'' Short said five
years after his retirement.
   Short died of cardiac arrest Thursday at Methodist Hospital,
where he had been listed in serious to critical condition since he
was admitted Dec. 6, said hospital spokeswoman Brenda Cook.
   Survivors include his wife, Maxine; a son, Robert Short of
Houston; and two stepdaughters, Leslie Adams of Bastrop, Texas, and
Charlotte Bivins of Greenbrier, W.Va. Services are scheduled for
Saturday at Niday South Park Funeral Home in Pearland, Texas.

   President Bush sent congratulations
to Vaclav Havel on his election today as president of
Czechoslovakia and pledged U.S. support for the rebirth of
democracy in the East European nation.
   The White House said the election of the once dissident
playwright ``marks a fitting end to a year of astonishing change in
Eastern Europe.''
   Bush sent the message from the remote Beeville, Texas, ranch
where he was winding up a post-Christmas hunting trip, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Havel, 53, jailed repeatedly over the past two decades for
defying Czechoslovakia's communist rulers with his calls for
freedom, was elected unanimously to the presidency by the 303
members of Parliament gathered in a medieval castle in Prague
earlier today.
   Fitzwater, in a written statement released in this Gulf of
Mexico city where the traveling White House was quartered, said:
   ``The president has sent a warm message of congratulations to
Vaclav Havel upon his election as president of Czechoslovakia. The
president noted the strong links between American and Czechoslovak
democracy, going back to the creation of the Czechoslovak state in
1918.''
   He said Bush ``pledged his commitment to the renewal and
strengthening of political, economic and cultural ties between
Czechoslovakia and the United States.''
   Bush's message, according to the spokesman, said that Havel's
election ``is living proof of what Mr. Havel has called the `power
of the powerless' to bring about peaceful democratic change.''

<TEXT>
   Parliament today crowned the
nation's peaceful revolution by electing playwright and opposition
leader Vaclav Havel as Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist
president in 41 years.
   In an unprecendented public vote that was televised nationwide,
the Communist-dominated parliament, or Federal Assembly,
unanimously chose Havel, who was jailed for five years by the
previous hard-line Communist leadership for speaking out against
totalitarianism.
   ``I will not disappoint you, but will lead this country to free
elections,'' Havel told hundreds of cheering supporters from a
balcony of the presidential Hradcany Castle after his election.
   ``This must happen in a decent and peaceful way so that the
clean face of our revolution is not sullied. It is a task for us
all.''
   The election of Havel, 53, is the crowning achievement of the
popular revolt that began only 41 days ago. It comes amid
democratic reforms in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and
Romania.
   Havel and his wife, Olga, then walked across the courtyard from
the castle to the St. Vitus Cathedral for a special Mass of
thanksgiving given by Czechoslovakia's 90-year-old Roman Catholic
prelate, Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek.
   At the entrance to the Gothic cathedral, several young girls
presented Havel with bouquets of white lillies.
   ``We came to St. Vitus ... to thank God for the great hope that
has opened before us in the last days of this year,'' Tomasek told
the crowd.
   The cathedral filled with Antonin Dvorak's ``Te Deum'' played by
the Prague Philharmonic and choir after the short service.
   The lawmakers' meeting was opened by Alexander Dubcek, champion
of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms crushed in 1968. He was returned
to power Thursday when parliament elected him chairman of the body.
   Dubcek and Havel are to serve until free legislative elections
are held next year.
   Havel, whose works were banned until recent weeks by the
Communists, was praised by Communist Prime Minister Marian Calfa as
``a man who is faithful to his beliefs despite persecution.''
   ``He never accepted offers from his friends or recommendations
by his enemies to emigrate where the conditions of his life would
have been more comfortable,'' Calfa told the deputies in his
nominating speech.
   President Bush was among foreign leaders today sending their
congratulations to Havel. He pledged U.S. support for the rebirth
of democracy in Czechoslovakia and the White House said his
election ``marks a fitting end to a year of astonishing change in
Eastern Europe.''
   In Warsaw, Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa welcomed ``with
great joy'' Havel's election and wished him strength in carrying
out his new responsibilities.
   In a scene unimaginable only a few weeks ago, Havel walked with
Dubcek up the red carpeted aisle of the castle hall to the flourish
of a military band, the applause of Communist deputies and the
flashes of camera bulbs.
   He signed the oath of office under the draped red, white and
blue flag of Czechoslovakia.
   As the band played the national anthem, 20 cannon salvos
resounded throughout the city.
   Within the next few months, parliament is expected to pass new
laws guaranteeing freedom of expression and religion and the right
of assembly and petition. Reforms already are being carried out for
a free-market economy.
   Havel helped form the opposition group Civic Forum on Nov. 20,
three days after a police crackdown on a peaceful student protest
for democratic reforms.
   Within weeks of the creation of Civic Forum, Communists leaders
voted themselves out of power and Miroslav Stepan, considered
reponsible for the police crackdown, was under arrest facing
charges that could bring him up to 10 years in jail.
   Havel, already respected for his battle for human rights,
overnight became the most popular man in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Havel for President'' buttons appeared on lapels, and campaign
posters covered every wall in central Prague.
   He has said he would be a ``working president'' to guide the
country to democratic elections.
   After the elections, parliament will choose a new president for
a full five-year term. Havel has said he's not interested in that
job and wants to go back to writing.
   The president's duties are largely ceremonial, but the position
holds great symbolic importance, especially now.
   Dubcek endured 20 years of humiliation at the hands of hard-line
Communists who ousted him as party leader and banished him for
trying to increase freedom with the ``Prague Spring'' reforms,
which were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion.
   The ``Prague Spring'' involved economic reform and
decentralizing control. The idea was proposed nearly 20 years later
by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and reform began sweeping
one country after another in Eastern Europe last fall.

<HEAD>U.S.-Funded Radio Plays Key Role in Romanian Revolt</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S.-funded Voice of America and
Radio Free Europe played a key part in preparing Romanians for
their revolt by informing them of the changes elsewhere in Eastern
Europe, Bucharest residents say.
   RFE's broadcasts in Romanian from Munich and VOA's from
Washington have a big following among Romania's 23 million people
who have had a severely restricted access to Western media.
   Media in neighboring Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and the
Soviet Union also helped keep Romanians abreast of Warsaw Pact
change.
   Clusters of Romanians formed every time Bulgarian state-run
Balkan Airlines posted the Bulgarian TV schedule in its Bucharest
office, and Aeroflot used to display Mikhail S. Gorbachev's latest
pronouncements in Romanian in its windows.
   But East European and Soviet broadcasts often could be received
and understood only on the peripheries of the country, and rarely
carried Romanian emigre or dissident views.
   Romanians say VOA and RFE kept them abreast of news about their
own country, such as a significant letter last spring to Nicolae
Ceausescu in which six former Communist Party officials demanded
major changes and were arrested because of it.
   ``We owe thanks to the United States for the help of the VOA and
Radio Free Europe,'' said a staffer at Bucharest's main children's
hospital. ``Many people were listening to VOA and RFE.''
   Through RFE, a Western diplomat said, Romanians with little
experience of democracy know its terms and progress through the
rest of Eastern Europe.
   ``They've never done it themselves, but they are aware,'' said
the diplomat, speaking on condition he not be identified.
   Under Ceausescu, Romanian TV broadcast only two hours a night,
and up to 90 minutes of that time was devoted to the president and
his deeds.
   Radio gave a diet of similar news, and virtually the only item
anybody read in the newspapers were the meager sports report and
the weather.
   Radio and television, which were captured by the revolutionaries
who forced Ceausescu from power a week ago, have become beacons of
the revolt, spreading vital news through the country.
   Even now, however, the dissenting voices who have united against
Ceausescu can still communicate with each other _ and with the
country _ most effectively through RFE.
   Dissidents like Doina Cornea, a former university professor in
Cluj placed under house arrest for her critical letters to
Ceausescu, poet Mircea Dinescu in Bucharest and writer Dan
Petruescu in Iasi, were unable to meet under Ceausescu's
totalitarian rule. ``They `met' on RFE,'' a Bucharest resident said.
   Other still powerful remnants of totalitarianism enhance the
continued importance of the U.S.-funded radio stations, which can
draw on the expertise of many well-informed Romanian exiles.
   Two years ago, for instance, Ceausescu's wife, Elena, ordered
all Western news agencies into Romania cut, on grounds they were
not needed. Delivery has not been restored.
   Thus, VOA and RFE are still a primary source of information for
Romanians eager to know how their revolution is perceived in the
West.
   ``VOA is the most important broadcast,'' resident Valentin
Hornicar said outside Communist Party headquarters Thursday.
   ``Not only food and medicine are needed,'' said Hornicar, 26.
``We need magazines and newspapers from all over the United States
and all over Europe. We need to see what is being said about us.''

   Presiding Bishop J.O. Patterson Sr. of the
Church of God in Christ, who retired earlier this year in failing
health, died Friday. He was 77.
   Patterson, leader of the church's 3.7 million members around the
world, died about 6 a.m. at William F. Bowld Hospital in Memphis,
said Elaine Newsome, spokeswoman of the denomination.
   Patterson was first elected presiding bishop of the church, the
world's largest black pentecostal holiness denomination, in 1968.
   He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in April but refused to
be treated for the disease because, he said, ``The treatment of
prayer is better than chemotherapy.''
   Doctors in the spring thought Patterson would die by October,
said David Hall, editor of the denomination's newspaper, Whole
Truth.
   The bishop's family was working on memorial arrangements Friday
morning, the church said.

<HEAD>Lottery Winner Donates Money To Troubled Family</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The winner of Florida's record $55 million
lottery prize has gone to the aid of a beleaguered family by making
a $10,000 donation for a 13-year-old girl who needs a kidney
transplant.
   Lottery winner Sheelah Ryan, who established a foundation to
help the needy, said Thursday she hoped the money would prompt
others to help the family of Bob and Donna Armstrong, whose other
daughter was kidnapped and killed in a still-unsolved case.
   Christina Armstrong, 13, suffers from Alport's Syndrome, an
incurable hereditary disease, and is undergoing kidney dialysis
while awaiting a suitable transplant. The Armstrongs expect to
incur bills totaling $100,000.
   Their 6-year-old daughter Regina Mae disappeared from in front
of the family home more than four years ago. The girl's skull was
discovered in a rural area, but police have never found her killer.
   ``I feel very strong that this family has suffered enough,'' Ms.
Ryan said. ``And the foundation cares very deeply about helping
children.''
   The foundation has pledged money to a number of causes,
including $1,000 to college students trying to find homes for stray
cats and $500 to a high school student who found and returned a
$100,000 check.
   The girls' father, Bob Armstrong, recalled Wednesday that he
used to deliver salt for Ms. Ryan's water softener about five years
ago, when she was a real estate saleswoman living in a mobile home.
   Ms. Ryan won the big prize in 1988, but continues to work in
real estate and lives quietly.
   ``I'm sure she wouldn't remember me,'' Armstrong said after
hearing of the donation. ``I was just a long-haired, bearded thing
who was always sweating from hauling around heavy equipment. This
is one heck of a coincidence.''
   Ms. Ryan did not remember him, but she remembered the story of
Regina Mae's disappearance.
   She got approval from a majority of the Ryan Foundation's board
of directors to donate $5,000, then decided to give $5,000 of her
own money.
   ``The people of central Florida have been very good about
contributing to the poor and the homeless, but maybe we can start
something off to get them to contribute here,'' Ms. Ryan said.
``This family has had enough.''

<HEAD>Revolution Unleashes Peasants' Hopes for Democracy</HEAD>

   No flags flutter from the hovels of
Cornesti, and not one house has been scarred by bullets. But the
revolt has unleashed hopes in this peasant village that are as
fervent as any in Bucharest.
   ``We want to live just like anybody else in a free capitalist
society,'' Laszlo Kiss said.
   Kiss's daughter, Tuende, said she already is making plans to run
her own shop, an unheard of activity under executed dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, who allowed no private entrepreneurship during
his 24 years of communist rule.
   ``Then,'' she said with a dreamy smile, ``I want to see the
world.''
   For Ion Ardilian, Kiss's neighbor, the revolt that brought
promises of democracy has opened the door ``to the possiblity of
working as hard as I want and owning as much property as I can
afford.''
   The village of 600 people is less than five miles from
Timisoara, the nation's fourth-largest city, where a small crowd
protecting a defiant Protestant pastor Dec. 15 sparked nationwide
unrest that ended the Ceausescu era.
   To the outsider, it seems another world, reachable only by a
dirt road pitted with deep potholes.
   The village of small houses showed no sign on a recent afternoon
of the historic events of the past two weeks. The main dirt road
was nearly deserted.
   But villagers said the revolution has inspired in them the same
pride and joy as those of their urban countrymen. And, while
acknowledging that Cornesti appears the same in many ways as before
the revolution, Kiss and others said change was coming.
   ``The same people are sitting in the village council chairs as
before, but they're just keeping the seats warm until new people
are chosen,'' Kiss, 47 said. ``We're not interfering, we're happy
to let things take their course.''
   ``The village leadership became Communist Party members just to
be able to oppress us,'' added Ardilian, 32. ``Whenever someone did
something they didn't like, they bought in the militia to get their
own way. But we're not seeking revenge, we're content to wait.''
   The status of approximately 30 informers, until recently in the
pay of Ceausescu's infamous Securitate secret police, also remains
the same.
   ``Nobody had anything to do with them before, nobody has
anything to do with them now,'' said Kiss. Relatives gathered in
the family's cold and modest sitting room, where a bed-couch piled
high with thick quilts competed for space with a kitchen table and
chairs.
   Kiss, a farm laborer with a small plot of land and some sheep of
his own, painted a dismal picture of life in Cornesti under
Ceausescu.
   ``As a villager, you never went to any functionary, whether in
the city or here, without eggs, meat or other `gifts,''' he said.
``If you didn't bribe them, you accomplished nothing.''
   ``I once had a herd of 100 sheep but was forced to sell most of
them to the state,'' he said. ``When I refused, I was labeled an
anti-socialist element and threatened by the Securitate.''
   The family's life was further complicated by their religious
beliefs. As Seventh Day Adventists, outside the mainstream Orthodox
Catholic Church controlled by the state, they faced hurdles at
school and the workplace.
   ``My two sons and daughter weren't allowed to complete high
school, and the boys were forced to find work as manual laborers,''
he said.
   There were no battles in Cornesti of the kind in the major
cities that pitted the army and civilan revolutionaries against
die-hard Securitate agents.
   They offered their services anyway.
   ``We were told that civilians were not needed, and the army
could mop up the terrorists alone,'' said Kiss. ``But decades of
oppression have made us alert.
   ``We're ready to fight and to die, if necessary, to prevent a
return to dictatorship.''

<TEXT>
   Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife,
Elena, were held prisoner in a constantly moving armored car for
the last three days of their lives, Britain's Independent
Television News said today.
   The Ceausescus were executed by firing squad on Christmas Day
after a secret trial.
   ``You saw in the movie on the television that he got out of an
armored car. Now I can tell you that he lived for three days in
that armored car. And the armored car was washed and moved inside
the unit (a military area) as if nobody was inside,'' Capt. Mihail
Lupoi, identified as a senior army official, told ITN.
   Lupoi said Ceausescu was a diabetic but refused to take his
daily dose of insulin during his last three days.
   Ceausescu was handed over to the army by a mob who had
surrounded him at a checkpoint, said Lupoi, who had been called to
the scene.
   He was then constantly driven around in the armored car for the
three days in a military area outside the capital to prevent any
attempt by loyal members of his security forces to free him, Lupoi
said.
   ITN also reported that when Ceausescu addressed a crowd from the
balcony of his palace on Dec. 21, he already had an escape plan
worked out.
   When Ceausescu's speech was drowned out by the angry crowd, the
escape plan went into operation, ITN said. The Ceausescus left the
next morning by helicopter which carried them to a pre-arranged
meeting with his chauffeur-driven car, it said. That night they ran
into a road block 60 miles west of the capital. There Ceausescu was
recognized by a policeman, who told people that the president and
his wife were in the car, Lupoi said.

<HEAD>Door Still Open for Senior Lawmakers to Pocket Campaign Funds on
Retiring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The much-criticized custom in which senior
members of Congress may pocket leftover campaign funds when they
retire or suffer defeat at the polls is targeted for repeal under
newly minted ethics legislation.
   But this wouldn't take effect until 1993 as lawmakers are
reluctant to slam the door too quickly. Thus, they are giving
themselves a chance to run for one more term and then retire with
the funds.
   ``I think there are some members who will take advantage of
it,'' says Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., an advocate of abolishing the
practice. `` ... But I don't think you're talking about a massive
movement. I would be surprised if it were more than you could count
on one hand.''
   ``I have something in the vicinity of 200 grand in my campaign
fund and I have no intention whatever of retiring,'' he says.
   Under a bill approved before Congress adjourned for the
holidays, lawmakers raised their pay from the current level $89,500
for both houses to $96,600 for House members next year and $124,400
in 1991. Senate pay would rise to $98,400 in 1990 and $101,400 the
year thereafter.
   To propel the politically touchy pay package, lawmakers attached
an array of ethics features, including repeal in 1993 of the right
of departing senior House members to convert leftover campaign
funds to their personal use.
   Federal law already had barred defeated or retiring members of
Congress from carting off surplus political money. But that
prohibition contained a gaping loophole, a ``grandfather clause''
that exempted lawmakers who were on Capitol Hill before 1980.
   The pay and ethics package, already signed into law by President
Bush, would repeal the ``grandfather clause.'' But it would take
three years to do so, thus providing maneuvering room to lawmakers
who are planning a retirement and counting on a comfortable nest
egg of campaign cash.
   Lawmakers whose right to convert surplus funds had been
``grandfathered in,'' now can take the money only if they retire
before the start of the 103rd Congress in January 1993.
   ``This is a very major step,'' says Susan Manes, vice president
for issues of Common Cause, the citizens lobby. ``For too long the
grandfather clause has allowed certain members of Congress to take
their political money with them when they leave.''
   ``In effect, this allowed special interests to channel money to
sitting members of Congress, which they in turn can use when they
retire,'' she said.
   The measure also limits the amount they may take with them to
the balance in their campaign fund as of the date of enactment,
Nov. 30.
   It applies to senators as well as House members. But the Senate
already had a rule barring members, retiring or otherwise, from
converting campaign funds. It might be difficult to enforce the
rule against a former lawmaker, but the Senate Ethics Committee
says it has never known one to violate it.
   House members have not been bashful about converting the funds.
A January 1988 study by Congressional Quarterly said
``grandfathered'' lawmakers had converted at least $862,000 since
1980. The Ralph Nader group Congress Watch estimated that the total
potential ``hidden pension'' accumulated by these lawmakers totaled
$39 million.
   The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in October counted 186
sitting lawmakers covered by the grandfather clause, including some
seniority-heavy powers in the House with huge cash reserves in
their funds. Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., and House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., were first and second
respectively, both topping $1 million.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., had $639,513.
   Stories of lawmakers who have departed with campaign cash in
hand abound in the House. Former Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Mo., in what
some call the largest conversion in memory, disbursed $345,000 to
himself from his campaign fund early this year.
   And Rep. John J. Duncan, R-Tenn., died of cancer in June 1988,
bequeathing his $604,521 campaign fund to his wife and four
children.
   After voters rejected former Banking Committee Chairman Fernand
J. St Germain, D-R.I., last November, he told reporters he probably
would use his leftover campaign dollars ``for charitable and
political purposes.''
   Thus far, the largest outlay has been $67,500 to the Washington
law firm of Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin &amp; Kahn, which represented
him over the last few years while his dealings with savings and
loan and other lobbyists were under investigation at the Justice
Department.
   ``They were legal fees for the overall inquiries,'' says the
silver-haired, 61-year-old Democrat whom the department eventually
declined to prosecute. He is now practicing law and doing a ``very
little'' lobbying.
   Actually, St Germain's action might just remain legal after the
grandfather clause is repealed once and for all. The House
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct has ruled more than once
that paying lawyers to keep congressmen out of jail is a legitimate
political expense.
   Reached at his Washington office recently, St Germain indicated
that the issue was less than fascinating to him. ``Frankly,'' he
said, ``I'm not in Congress anymore, I'm busy in other areas and I
leave these questions to sitting members of Congress.''

<HEAD>Frank Lloyd Wright Colleagues Blast New Jail Design</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Associates of Frank Lloyd Wright have
asked Marin County officials to redesign a proposed $23 million
jail rather than ``denigrate'' the memory of the renowned architect.
   The two-story jail, with up to 219 cells, would be built in
front of one of Wright's most famous works _ the Marin County Civic
Center, whose pale pink arches sweep across three small knolls
along busy U.S. Highway 101.
   The center is the only government building designed by Wright
that actually was built.
   William Wesley Peters, senior architect and chairman of the
board of trustees of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, and San
Francisco architect Aaron Green, who worked closely with Wright,
wrote to the county Board of Supervisors last week, saying they
were appalled by the jail design. They asked that it be redone to
harmonize with the Wright's building.
   The rectangular jail would stand 24 feet high and would obscure
much of the view of the civic center.
   The project is ``callously different from the soft and graceful
lines of Frank Lloyd Wright's Hall of Justice and Administration
Building'' and would be ``the antithesis of what Frank Lloyd Wright
had so creatively conceived,'' Green wrote.
   Peters told supervisors the project ``would seriously denigrate
Frank Lloyd Wright's legacy to Marin County, to California and to
the world.''
   But county supervisors, who are under court order to relieve
jail crowding, say it is unlikely the design will be significantly
changed.
   ``We just don't have time,'' said Supervisor Al Aramburu. ``It's
the best we could do, given the site.''
   Construction must begin by next fall so the county can qualify
for state money for the project.
   ``If the board is to stop this, its members should be thrown in
jail. It would be criminal to lose the state bond money,'' said
Robert Stockwell, president of the board.

   The country's main
anti-apartheid alliance said Friday it was entering 1990 with
confidence that ``victory for democracy is in sight.''
   The United Democratic Front and the Mass Democratic Movement,
two overlapping coalitions of opposition groups, said in a New
Year's message that government efforts at repression during the
1980s had failed quell black resistance.
   ``Despite a determined state assault on progressive people's
organizations, the state of emergency (imposed in 1986) failed
miserably in its desire to submit us further to the will of the
minority,'' the statement said.
   It said 1990 would be a pivotal year, bringing the expected
release of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
and the possibility of negotiations on a post-apartheid political
structure.
   ``What we will all be doing, from both government and liberation
movement sides, will determine whether South Africa goes through
the path of a bloodbath or takes the high road of a less violent
transition to a non-racial and democratic South Africa,'' the
statement said. ``We enter the 1990s with the hope and confidence
that victory for democracy in our country is in sight.''
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp., in a year-end
commentary Friday, said ``the face of South Africa has changed
dramatically and irrevocably in the 1980s'' because of moves away
from racial discrimination and toward limited political
power-sharing.
   ``Ahead lies the further broadening of democracy with the
extension of the principle of power sharing at all levels of
government to black South Africans,'' the commentary said. How to
achieve that ``in a manner fair and equitable to all is the
challenge that awaits the leadership of all political
constituencies in the 1990s.''
   The anti-apartheid Democratic Party, which won 20 percent of the
vote in white parliamentary elections in September, commended
President F.W. de Klerk for his performance since the election.
   The Democrats' three co-leaders praised de Klerk for freeing
several prominent political prisoners, reducing the duration of
mandatory military service and abolishing segregated beaches. But
they said de Klerk and his National Party remained wedded to the
concept of racial groups as the foundation of future political
system.
   ``We need to introduce into our society the principles of equal
and equivalent franchise for all adults,'' the Democrats' leaders
said. ``Anything short of a full democracy is a threat to our safe
future.''

   Relatives and not the World Wildlife Fund
will divide the estate of a man who went on a shooting rampage two
years ago and killed six members of his family.
   An out-of-court settlement has been reached to distribute the
estate of Robert Dreesman, 40, who allegedly killed his parents,
and his widowed sister and her three children when they sat down to
dinner on Dec. 30, 1987. He then turned the gun on himself,
according to authorities.
   Nineteen days before the slayings, he had drafted a will leaving
each member of his family $1 and leaving the rest of his estate,
estimated to be worth about $500,000, to the World Wildlife Fund.
   But surviving family members filed wrongful death claims against
his estate, claiming loss of future income from John Dreesman, 79,
and his wife, Agnes, 74.
   Wayne Forgey, executor of the parents' estate, said all parties
had agreed to distribute the assets to relatives, with an
independent third-party investigator, Wayne Newkirk of Winterset,
to decide how to divide the money.

   When three men agreed to murder a United Mine
Workers opposition leader and his family in 1969, they were told
the killings would amount to nothing more than ``local news'' in
the coal fields of western Pennsylvania.
   But in the two decades since, the New Year's Eve slayings of
Joseph A. ``Jock'' Yablonski, 59, his wife, Margaret, 57, and their
daughter, Charlotte, 25, have been a catalyst for major reform in
the coal miners' union.
   And the ``local news'' made national headlines.
   ``Basically, all the things my father had said should be done
have been done,'' said Kenneth Yablonski, now 55, who found the
bodies in the family's stone farmhouse in Clarksville almost a week
after the killings.
   In the months leading up to his death, Yablonski had waged an
unsuccessful campaign to unseat UMW President W.A. ``Tony'' Boyle.
He accused Boyle of corruption, nepotism and misuse of UMW funds.
   Yablonski also pushed for increased rights for rank-and-file
members in electing district officers and fought to clean up union
elections.
   ``All of those things were accomplished,'' said his son, an
attorney in nearby Washington, Pa. ``In the total picture, because
of what happened, I don't think anyone would say the United Mine
Workers is corrupt or its officers are totalitarian.''
   Throughout the 1969 campaign, Yablonski endured intimidation
from Boyle supporters. Until his death, he was suspicious of
strangers who approached him or his family, and with good reason.
   About two weeks before the murders, two of the gunmen had gone
to Yablonski's rural Washington County house, ostensibly asking for
help in getting mining jobs. But Paul E. Gilly and Claude E. Vealey
lost their nerve and did not shoot Yablonski that day.
   That evening, Yablonski told his son: ``Ken, I believe there
were two men here to kill me today.''
   Despite his defeat in the Dec. 9, 1969, election, Yablonski had
remained a vocal opponent of Boyle and had asked the U.S. Labor
Department to investigate possible voter fraud.
   Boyle saw himself as the hard-line heir to long-time UMW boss
John L. Lewis but couldn't match Lewis' charisma, said James A.
Craft, a business administration professor at the University of
Pittsburgh. At the same time, Yablonski was attempting to bring
about reforms.
   ``It was one of those kind of events that provided us with real
change,'' Craft said. ``Yablonski wanted to make some changes and
open things up and Boyle wanted to maintain control. And it
exploded in terms of something terrible happening.''
   Confessions and testimony revealed that Boyle ordered the
killings and other union officials embezzled UMW funds to hire the
gunmen.
   In all, nine people, including Boyle, were convicted. The three
gunmen _ Gilly, Vealey and Aubran W. ``Buddy'' Martin, all of Ohio
_ are serving life prison terms in Pennsylvania, as is the former
UMW official who hired them, Albert E. Pass. The other five
defendants either have been released or, like Boyle, died in jail.
   Although strikes, coal-field disturbances and decreased
production highlighted the ensuing administration of reformist
Arnold Miller, Craft said the union now is on more stable footing.
He called UMW President Richard Trumka a ``reasonable guy with
something on the ball'' and a vision for the union.
   Trumka has led the union in a protracted contract dispute with
the Pittston Co., a months-long strike in which miners say they are
fighting to retain hard-won health benefits.
   Kenneth Yablonski said he and his brother, Joseph Jr., who
practices law in Washington, D.C., continue to oppose parole
requests by those convicted of the killings.
   ``Twenty years hasn't diminished the horror of what happened to
our family,'' he said.
   ``Who are these people to think that 20 years has made a
difference?''

   It's a dirty job, but somebody had to do it.
   Illinois has an official state bird, state flower, state fish,
state insect, even a state fossil. But the Illinois Soil
Classifiers Association insists that what the Land of Lincoln
really needs is a state soil.
   They've formed a State Soil Committee to lobby lawmakers to that
end.
   ``It ties all the symbols of the state together, committee chair
Bob McLeese of Monticello said recently. ``They all rely on soil
for their existence.''
   Illinois' official tree, the White Oak, and state flower, the
violet, grow in the soil. The state bird, the cardinal, gets worms
from it. Monarch butterflies, the state bug, live off nectar from
flowers that grow in the soil. The state fish, the bluegill, swims
in ponds resting on earth.
   Even the state's fossil _ Tullimonstrum gregarium, or,
familiarly, the Tully monster _ lived in Illinois soil, albeit 280
million years ago.
   Members of the association, many of whom work for the U.S.
Agriculture Department's Soil Conservation Service, have selected
Drummer silty clay loam as their nominee.
   That soil beat Cisne silt loam 2-1 in a poll of the group's
approximately 100 members. Drummer silty clay loam covers more than
1.6 million acres of the state, and many of the state's corn stalks
and soybeans call it home.
   State Rep. Gordon Ropp, R-Normal, said he'll sponsor a state
soil bill in the General Assembly, adding, ``I certainly think soil
has as much as priority as the Tully monster.''

   Mayor Jim Maloof says he has reached detente
with organizers of the Miss Russian-American Pageant by assuring
them that Peoria would still like to be a host city for the event.
   Maloof said Thursday he called the prime organizer, Vera von
Wiren Garczynski, in New York to explain why he didn't plug the
pageant more in a national television appearance after the
Slavic-American Cultural Association announced it would hold the
U.S. portion of the pageant in Peoria.
   Maloof said he explained to Garczynski that he wasn't given
enough time by producers of the ``CBS Morning News'' to talk about
the pageant.
   Garczynski told the Peoria Journal Star that members of the
association and Soviet officials were upset by Maloof's brief
remarks on the show, and that Peoria officials seemed more
interested in short-term publicity than in the event itself.
   ``That explanation is fine,'' Garczynski said. ``I don't want
any fights. One does not need any sensational controversy here.''
   Promoters are hailing the pageant as a symbol of the new harmony
between the United States and the Soviet Union. The pageant will
consist of two contests, one for American women in Peoria and
another for Soviet women in Moscow.
   The Peoria portion is tentatively scheduled to coincide with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to the United States
this spring. The Soviet contest is scheduled for January.
   Maloof called the questions raised by Garczynski about Peoria's
sincerity a ``misunderstanding.''

<HEAD>Emergency Meeting of North Korean Envoys to East Europe Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea has called home its
ambassadors from its Communist allies for an emergency meeting,
apparently because of the changes in Eastern Europe, a South Korean
government official said Thursday.
   North Korea appeared to have convened a meeting of its
ambassadors to 30 countries, including China and the Soviet Union,
one month ahead of schedule to discuss the radical liberalization
in many of its allies, said South Korean Unification Minister Lee
Hong-ku.
   The Korea Times quoted a South Korean government source as
saying: ``There is a high probability that the North will seek
gradual openness ... to escape from political isolation and to
boost the economy.''
   On Tuesday, North Korean President Kim Il Sung, who has built up
a massive personality cult in his four decades of hard-line rule,
recognized the new Romanian government.
   North Korea has called for the Communist countries to increase
vigilance against ``imperialist'' efforts to undermine socialism.
   Rodong Shinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's
Communist Party, urged intensifying ``revolutionary education'' in
the country in the face of ``the ever more malicious anti-socialist
moves of the imperialists.''
   All people should be encouraged to establish a correct outlook
by ``carrying into effect the idea and intentions of the party and
the leader, deeply trusting them as the mainstay,'' said the
paper's editorial, carried by Pyongyang's official Korean Central
News Agency, monitored in Tokyo.
   ``In our country today, the superiority of socialism is fully
displayed, the entire people are closely united behind the party
and the leader, and a healthy, revolutionary trait is pervading the
whole society,'' it said.
   But, it added, ``the imperialists are craftily maneuvering to
break the people's conviction of socialism and undermine socialism
from within.''
   Under these conditions, the editorial added, only when
revolutionary education is intensified ``is it possible to enhance
the anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit and class consciousness
of the people still further and prevent the infiltration of the
corrupt bourgeois ideology and mode of life.''
   The official news agency also said Kim's message to new Romanian
leader Ion Iliescu expressed hope for strengthening friendly and
cooperative relations, and wished the Romanian people success.

   Sheriff Allen Sloan should either
apologize for a racial slur a newspaper said he made and hire a
black chief deputy, or resign, business and civic leaders say.
   The Richland County sheriff has denied making the remark
attributed to him by The State newspaper on Dec. 22 and said
Thursday he would take neither action recommended by the Greater
Columbia Community Relations Council.
   The council prefers that Sloan stay in office, said its
chairman, Paul Beazley.
   Sloan said he was shown the council's statement shortly before
its release and was appalled to hear that its conclusions and
recommendations were unanimous and backed by the executive
committee of the Greater Columbia Chamber of Commerce.
   ``As for the apology, I have already made an apology numerous
times through the media and would like to take this opportunity as
well to say that anything that was said to cause embarrassment to
the black community or the white community, that I am truly sorry
and apologize for it,'' Sloan said.
   ``I am everybody's sheriff,'' he said. ``I was elected by the
whites and the blacks.''
   The State reported that when asked in an interview in his office
how safety could be improved at Columbia Mall, where four shootings
have occurred in the past six months, Sloan replied: ``Keep the
niggers out.''
   Sloan has maintained he did not make the racial slur and said no
one on the council consulted him before concluding that he had.
   The Community Relations Council said Thursday that if Sloan
stays in office he should hire a black second-in-command, partly to
advise him on race relations.
   The sheriff said he would not do that.
   ``There is no way that I'm going to let any group of citizens
tell me how to hire or promote in this office, especially in
stepping over the bounds in thinking it had to be someone black,''
Sloan said. ``I am not going to fire my chief deputy simply to hire
someone because of a color. That's racial discrimination in its
purest form right there.''
   The Community Relations Council wichland County Council.
   Sloan, elected in 1988 to a four-year term, is the chief law
enforcement officer in Richland County. The county, where the
capital city of Columbia is located, is the third-most populous
county in the state with 285,000 residents.

   Actor Christian Michael Slater was
jailed Friday after he allegedly led authorities on a chase,
crashed his sports car into a pole and scuffled with sheriff's
deputies.
   Slater, 20, whose film credits include ``Heathers'' and
``Tucker,'' was booked for investigation of drunken driving, hit
and run, driving with a suspended license, evading arrest, and
assault on a peace officer, sheriff's Sgt. Cecil Rhambo said. Bail
was set at $3,000. The actor remained in custody Friday.
   The chase began about 1 a.m. when a deputy saw a late-model Saab
Turbo 900 traveling at more than 50 mph in a 35 mph zone, the
sergeant said. When the deputy tried to stop the motorist, he sped
off, made two right turns and drove into an alley, where his car
slammed into a telephone pole, he said.
   Three passengers remained in the car while Slater got out and
scaled a chain link fence, said Rhambo. When three deputies tried
to arrest him, a ``small struggle'' ensued, he said.
   Slater also has appeared in the films ``The Name of the Rose''
and ``The Legend of Billie Jean.''

   Comedian-actor Sinbad told 100
underprivileged youths they can succeed through hard work,
confidence and a good education despite the negative influences of
drugs and crime that surround them.
   ``A lot of you may not know how much you have to offer, how
important you are,'' the actor, who plays Walter on the TV series
``A Different World,'' said Thursday during a visit to the YMCA
Youth Extension Center. ``I'm here to tell you you can do anything
you want to. But not if you're dead or in jail.''
   Sinbad, who was in town for a performance at the Midland
Theater, said that speaking in black communities was a way for him
to give back some of what he's learned to youngsters in need of
role models.
   ``There's something happening in the community that is very
tragic,'' he said. ``We have brothers killing brothers, right in
our own neighborhood, and over what? Dope, drugs.''
   He told the youths: ``I don't drink and I don't hide the fact
that I don't.''

<HEAD>North Korean Missile Help Sought by Syria, Egypt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

   Syria is believed to be seeking North
Korea's help in acquiring new surface-to-surface missiles after the
United States pressured China to cancel a reported deal, Israeli
military sources said Friday.
   The sources also said North Korea and Egypt have begun a project
to develop missiles patterned after Soviet-designed Scud missiles.
   The revelation by the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, comes at a time of mounting concern in Israel about an
intensified missile race in the Middle East.
   Fears intensified following Iraq's Dec. 7 launching of the Abed,
a 48-ton, three-stage ballistic missile that Baghdad claimed was
capable of putting satellites into space.
   North Korea has a well-developed arms industry, and the Israeli
sources said it had supplied Iran with Soviet-designed Scud
surface-to-surface missiles during Tehran's war with Iraq.
   The military sources said part of the Egyptian-North Korean
missile project was being developed in Egypt.
   Aharon Levran, a retired brigadier general and an independent
military analyst, said Egypt had an arsenal of aging Scud missiles
provided by the Soviet Union and had apparently turned to North
Korea last year for help in modernizing them.
   ``It's not known exactly what sort of help the North Koreans can
provide, whether it is just to renew the old Soviet missiles and
provide spare parts or maybe install improved components such as
guidance,'' he said.
   He also said published reports indicated North Korea was helping
Iran develop its own surface-to-surface missile and was training
pilots for the Tehran regime.
   The Scud-B, which has a range of 180 miles and poor accuracy,
was introduced into the Middle East in the early 1970s.
   Cairo apparently dropped out of a project with Argentina and
Iraq t develop a more accurate missile called the Condor 2 or Badr
2000. The missile was intended to have a range of about 540 miles
and better accuracy than the Scud.
   Egypt's withdrawal followed political pressure brought by
Washington after the arrest of two Egyptian colonels who were
accused of trying to smuggle technology out of the United States
that could be used to improve missile accuracy.
   President Bush sent National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to
Beijing this month to urge the Chinese to cancel a planned sale to
Syria of M-9 surface-to-surface missiles, which have a range of 370
miles and would be capable of hitting targets deep inside Israel.
   The Jerusalem Post reported Syria signed an agreement with China
for 140 M-9 missiles at a cost of $170 million.
   Israeli officials have said Israel was informed that China had
pledged to refrain from such sales, although some doubts still
existed about whether China would go through with the sale.
   Officials in Beijing have denied any sale was in the works.
   Syria has Soviet SS-21 missiles capable of hitting northern
Israel and Scud-B missiles.
   Levran said the Syrians would likely be interested in North
Korean help only if they could improve the range and accuracy of
the Scuds. Unlike the Egyptians, he noted, Syria has close ties
with the Soviet Union and would likely be able to get replacement
missiles without the need for renovation.

   Former Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel
Noriega was tipped off two days in advance of the United States'
plans to invade his country, Bush administration sources say in a
published report.
   Sources were divided on exactly how and when the former
strongman, who managed to evade the U.S. military and later sought
refuge in the Vatican Embassy, was warned.
   But one source told The Washington Times there is ``hard
evidence'' the tipoff came in the form of a telephone call to
Panama from the State Department about 48 hours before the military
operation was launched at 1 a.m. Dec. 20.
   The call was intercepted by a National Security Agency listening
post near Panama City, sources said.
   ``There was a leak tipping Noriega before it was coming,'' one
government official said. ``We don't know who it was, but we
believed it was somebody at State.''
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Taylor denied Noriega was warned, saying,
``We don't have any indication at this time that there was a major
OPSEC (operational security) problem.''
   Taylor said a captured Noriega bodyguard told U.S. interrogators
the Panamanian leader was informed of the military action about
three hours before it happened but refused to believe the
information.
   In Corpus Christi, Texas, where President Bush was vacationing,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he had no information
to give out on the report. In any event, Fitzwater said, ``it's
history now.''
   According to the newspaper, administration sources said some
Noriega forces and the general himself knew in advance about the
operation, dubbed Operation Just Cause. The sources based their
assessment, in part, on four incidents:
   _The night before the military intervention, Cuban MiG-21s
``shadowed'' C-141 Starlifters carrying U.S. Army paratroopers from
Pope Air Force Base, N.C., to Panama, the sources said. The
Pentagon is investigating whether one of the Cuban planes may have
fired its cannon as a warning shot. Noriega, with his relationship
with the United States crumbling in recent years, had increasingly
turned to Cuba for military and intelligence support, according to
administration sources.
   _Noriega intensified his nocturnal activities two days before
the U.S. assault, and the Pentagon has ``indications'' he visited
the Cuban Embassy at one point the night of Dec. 19-20 but left
when U.S. troops surrounded the compound, sources said.
   _Panamanian Defense Forces appeared to be lying in wait and
opened fire on Navy SEAL, or sea-air-land, commandoes who
parachuted into the area of Panama's small Paitilla Airport, where
the deposed leader maintained his private jet. The Pentagon said
four SEAL members were killed.
   _Noriega's most elite jungle warfare unit had vanished from its
battalion's facility when U.S. troops arrived to attack.
   The deposed Noriega today remained holed up in the Vatican
embassy in Panama City, where he sought asylum on Christmas Eve.
   A Panamanian official said new President Guillermo Endara's
government sent a letter to the Vatican asking that Noriega be
expelled.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did
not know whether the government asked that Noriega be turned over
to U.S. authorities or to Panama.
   In Texas, where President Bush was hunting, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated the U.S. stance that Noriega
should be handed over to the United States to stand trial on drug
trafficking charges.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said in Rome that officials
still hoped to resolve the crisis within days, but he gave no
details.

   Actor Christian Michael Slater was
jailed Friday after he allegedly led authorities on a chase,
crashed his sports car into a pole and scuffled with sheriff's
deputies.
   Slater, 20, whose film credits include ``Heathers'' and
``Tucker,'' was booked for investigation of drunken driving, hit
and run, driving with a suspended license, evading arrest, and
assault on a peace officer, sheriff's Sgt. Cecil Rhambo said. Bail
was set at $3,000. The actor remained in custody Friday.
   The chase began about 1 a.m. when a deputy saw a late-model Saab
Turbo 900 traveling at more than 50 mph in a 35 mph zone, the
sergeant said. When the deputy tried to stop the motorist, he sped
off, made two right turns and drove into an alley, where his car
slammed into a telephone pole, he said.
   Three passengers remained in the car while Slater got out and
scaled a chain link fence, said Rhambo. When three deputies tried
to arrest him, a ``small struggle'' ensued, he said.
   Slater also has appeared in the films ``The Name of the Rose''
and ``The Legend of Billie Jean.''

   Comedian-actor Sinbad told 100
underprivileged youths they can succeed through hard work,
confidence and a good education despite the negative influences of
drugs and crime that surround them.
   ``A lot of you may not know how much you have to offer, how
important you are,'' the actor, who plays Walter on the TV series
``A Different World,'' said Thursday during a visit to the YMCA
Youth Extension Center. ``I'm here to tell you you can do anything
you want to. But not if you're dead or in jail.''
   Sinbad, who was in town for a performance at the Midland
Theater, said that speaking in black communities was a way for him
to give back some of what he's learned to youngsters in need of
role models.
   ``There's something happening in the community that is very
tragic,'' he said. ``We have brothers killing brothers, right in
our own neighborhood, and over what? Dope, drugs.''
   He told the youths: ``I don't drink and I don't hide the fact
that I don't.''

<TEXT>
   Army troops have arrested 86 people,
bulldozed 20 houses and seized heavy weapons in a sweep of
Pakistan's frontier arms-trading town of Darra, officials said
Friday.
   The District Magistrate's office said anti-aircraft guns,
artillery, rocket launchers, drugs and counterfeit money were among
the items seized.
   Officials said the action by Pakistan's Frontier Corps was
prompted by the recent kidnapping of an official's 3-year-old son
and of another official who tried to arrest the suspect.
   The troops, some in armored personnel carriers, moved in and
freed the two, razed 20 houses belonging to alleged criminals and
arrested 86 people on various charges, officials said.
   Darra, seated in rocky tribal land about 35 miles from the
border of Afghanistan, has a booming cottage industry of producing
and copying firearms.
   But since the beginning of the Afghan civil war in 1978, it has
also expanded into open but illegal sales of sophisticated
weaponry, heroin and other contraband.
   Although officially off-limits to foreigners, its customers are
known to include Afghan rebels and extremist groups from India.

<HEAD>Stepped-Up Anti-Drug Program Allots Four-Fold Increase to California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department announced Friday a
nearly four-fold increase in federal money for anti-drug abuse
programs in California in its first allocation of state aid under a
stepped-up program approved by Congress.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the money is part of the
Bush administration's efforts to help communities ``attack the
problem at the point of consumption.''
   He said the department is urging states to incorporate
recommendations of President Bush's national drug control strategy
into their programs.
   California, the first state to receive funds for fiscal year
1990, will get $39.7 million, almost $30 million more than its 1989
grant of $10.8 million. Under a plan adopted by California, nearly
65 percent of the money will be distributed to local communities.
   ``The California plan was approved within two weeks of being
received, and the money is being distributed in less than six weeks
after the president signed the appropriations legislation,''
Thornburgh said in a statement.
   The department said its Bureau of Justice Assistance is
receiving and reviewing grant applications from other states.
Congress appropriated $395 million for the grants.
   The funds will enable California to continue supporting 36
projects including investigative task forces and specialized
prosecution initiatives, the department said. It said part of the
grant would be distributed to counties on the basis of population
and severity of crime.

<HEAD>Navy `Robbing Peter to Pay Paul' For 1991 Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is proposing to put two of its four
battleships in mothballs and limit purchases of the $1.2 billion
Trident submarine to every other year, a senior Pentagon official
says.
   But the service, studying proposals for the new fiscal-year
budget, is fighting to spare at least 14 aircraft carriers from
White House pressures to trim the military's most favored weapons
programs.
   President Bush, who is slated to deliver his budget to Congress
on Jan. 22, may be called upon to make the final decisions on any
suggested cuts, given their controversial nature.
   ``We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' the Pentagon official said
of the current budget-juggling exercise. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Fiscal 1991 spending plan will be a key barometer of the
Pentagon's ability to respond to pressures from budget cutters on
Capitol Hill and in the Office of Management and Budget.
   White House budget planners have told Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney he can spend a little more than $292 billion in the new
budget year, which begins next Oct. 1. That means Pentagon spending
won't keep pace with inflation, which the administration has
projected will increase at an average rate of 4.1 percent.
   The Navy, like other services, is being forced to trim programs
it holds to be successful _ such as the Trident _ in order to meet
these goals, said the senior official.
   The official said the service is ``seriously considering''
stretching out the annual purchases of the strategic Trident subs
to every other year.
   The sub's billion-dollar price tag has made it easy prey for
lawmakers advocating less lavish spending on strategic nuclear
weapons programs amid the warming of relations with the Soviet
Union.
   In November, the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics
Corp. in Groton, Conn., won a contract to build the 17th Trident
submarine.
   But due to its high cost and complexity, funds for the submarine
are stretched out over several years.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III has told Rep. John G.
Rowland, R-Conn., that he expects to request full funding for the
18th Trident submarine in the fiscal 1991 budget.
   But the letter made no mention about long-term procurement funds
for additional submarines.
   ``I'd put my money on some type of stretch-out,'' said another
Defense Department official, asked about the future of the Trident
program.
   The official said it was ``premature'' to talk about an end to
the program, and said that if an every-other-year purchase policy
is finally adopted, ``it may not even compromise the long-term
number'' of submarines, widely exepted to be 24.
   The service's World War II-era battleships also have become
targets of budget cutters on Capitol Hill, particularly in the
aftermath of last spring's explosion aboard the USS Iowa, which
claimed 47 sailors' lives. The tragedy spawned a series of
congressional hearings, where lawmakers voiced sharp criticism of
the huge ship's safety procedures and personnel practices.
   Even the chief of naval operations, Adm. Carlisle A. Trost,
admitted at one hearing that the future of the four warships was
``up for grabs'' in the budget debate. But the Navy leadership is
loathe to let the warships go, the senior official said.
   ``Nobody _ not the Army, not the Marine Corps, not the Navy,
wants to give those ships up,'' the official contended, arguing
that their mobile firepower offers a major boost when a president
calls for a little ``gunship diplomacy.''
   ``The '91 (budget) plan calls for putting two in mothballs. But
we'd still have two and we want to hang on to those,'' he said.
   The official argued against putting all four 58,000-ton vessels
in mothballs again, citing the high costs and problems that arose
during their remodernization in the early 1980s.
   The Navy was forced to ``call up old, retired sailors'' to help
in the rebuilding of the ships, the official said.
   ``When it came to taking the propellers off the darn things,
there was only one retired chief petty officer who knew how to do
it _ and you had to use special explosive charges to do it,'' the
official said.
   The second DOD official noted that congressional pressure may
work against mothballing the battleships, since their home ports
were to be dispersed among four states under a revised program.
   ``Our phones rang off the hook'' from lawmakers unhappy about
Trost's suggestion of the ships' possible demise, the official said.
   The senior official said that the Navy is fighting to save at
least 14 aircraft carriers during the next fiscal year.
   One carrier _ the World War II-era Midway _ is scheduled for
retirement next year, which would bring the fleet from 15 to 14.
   ``Tell me, which commitment are we supposed to walk away from?''
the official asked, pointing out that the U.S. commitment to sail
the Indian Ocean and keep tabs on the potentially explosive Persian
Gulf haven't changed.
   The official also said the requirements of the Navy most
probably will increase as the service is asked to place more power
on the high seas to advance the nation's war against illicit
narcotics traffickers.

   December's record deep freeze has Easterners
and Midwesterners clogging phone lines at desert resorts and
Universal Studios as they seek escape in the Southern California
sun.
   ``We have an 800 number to call for information about Palm
Springs and it's been ringing off the hook. And most of the calls
have been from back East,'' said Carolyn Patten of the Palm Springs
city tourism office.
   ``They want to know `Can we get some sun?' They are so tired of
the snow. I don't know how they're going to feel in March, but they
hate it now,'' Patten said Thursday.
   It's too early to cite statistics, but a survey of resort hotels
in the Coachella Valley surrounding Palm Springs indicated this
winter tourist season looks like a scorcher, with a hot streak of
early bookings.
   ``The phones are just going crazy on us,'' said Jim Lopez,
marketing director at the 860-room Marriott Desert Springs Resort
in Palm Desert. ``We've seen an increase in reservations within a
two-week time period, and I think that's because it's been pretty
darn cold around the country.''
   Typical high temperatures last weekend were 12 in Detroit, 14 in
Indianapolis, 44 in Miami Beach and 37 in Orlando, Fla.
   It was 82 in Palm Springs, part of unseasonably warm weather in
what forecasters say may be the driest December since 1876.
   Since then, things have averaged out again, with temperatures in
both Florida and Southern California running in the 60s and 70s.
But the earlier news of the big chill that extended into Florida
had its effect.
   ``Some of the people coming from back East this year have
remarked they were coming here instead of Florida because the
weather is better,'' said Ken Irwin at La Mancha Private Villas,
where amenities such as private swimming pools and tennis courts
come at a price tag of up to $895 a night.
   Overall, Southern California tourism has been slowing despite an
increase in foreign visitors, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for
the Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
   Americans are traveling less because of fears of a weaker
economy, higher air fares ``and there is a lingering fear of
earthquakes,'' Kyser said.
   But at the Universal Studios tour, where a fake quake is a
popular ride, the flood of calls has been greater than usual this
post-Christmas season, said spokesman Jim Yeager.
   ``The tour guide person says the last two to three days the line
has been ringing off the hook with people from the East Coast,''
Yeager said.
   ``We are getting a lot of calls coming in and the first question
asked is, `What is the weather?''' said Rolfe G. Arnhym, executive
vice president of the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce.
   All that interest could disappear, he points out, with just one
cold snap or a few stories about desert storms.
   ``We've had situations where the weather has done a 180 on us
and our tourists have scampered off elsewhere.''

   A Chevron tanker pulled alongside a sinking
freighter today that 28 crewmen were fighting to keep afloat in the
North Pacific.
   The tanker delivered additional pumps to reverse the flow of
water into two of the Bulka's cargo holds and stood by 800 miles
northeast of Oahu to rescue the 600-foot scrap-metal carrier's crew
if necessary, Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler said.
   Spangler said the Greek officers and Philippine crew were out of
danger unless the ship sank rapidly.
   ``It seems to us they still have a chance to save the ship,''
Spangler said. ``It's just a wait-and-see game to see if the pumps
will do it.''
   One of the cargo holds was flooded and a second was filling
rapidly, said Air Force Sgt. Neil Anderson of the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center in Honolulu. The cause of the leak was unknown.
   ``The vessel is bowed down and listing slighting toward
starboard,'' Anderson said. ``As it lists more as it fills up the
crew probably will have to abandon ship.''
   Spangler said the ship was listing 6 degrees to starboard and
was down 15 feet at its bow.
   Anderson said the vessel was owned by a Greek shipping company
based in Athens, Bacolitsas and Sons, but did not know if the ship
was registered there. He said the ship was bound for either North
or South Korea and was carrying scrap metal, but didn't know the
tonnage.
   The tanker Chevron Colorado was diverted to the foundering
vessel and passed three pumps to the Bulka this morning, Hubbard
said. The Coast Guard cutter Sassafras was expected to reach the
area Saturday.
   The crew, equipped with life vests and life rafts, was prepared
to abandon ship if the pumping failed, Hubbard said.
   Winds in the area were 10 to 15 mph and seas were running about
six feet, according to Roy Matsuda, marine forecaster at the
National Weather Service office in Honolulu.
   A Coast Guard C-130 search and rescue airplane was on the scene
and in radio contact with the Bulka, Hubbard said.

<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi catfish farmers may have
lost up to one-fifth of an average monthly harvest because last
week's big chill froze fish ponds solid, industry officials say.
   In Georgia, state biologists fear that recent freezing coastal
temperatures will mean no chance for a healthy shrimp season next
year _ more bad news for a shrimping industry already reeling from
a poor fall crop and low prices.
   Most of the Delta's catfish processing plants reopened Friday
after cold weather forced them to close for about a week.
Mississippi processes about 7 million pounds of catfish weekly, or
about 80 percent of the catfish consumed in the United States.
   From 26 million to 30 million pounds of catfish may have been
lost, said Hugh Warren, executive vice president of the Catfish
Farmers of America, a trade association. Industry officials said it
will be at least another week before farmers know the full impact
of the freeze. Thawing ponds are just beginning to reveal dead fish.
   More than 2,700 workers at the state's largest catfish
processing plants have been off their jobs, he said.
   Farmers have suffered losses as high as 20 percent when ponds
have frozen previously, said Dick Stevens, president of Country
Skillet Processing Co. Country Skillet and Delta Pride Processors,
two of the industry's largest companies, process about 60 percent
of the nation's farm-raised catfish.
   ``The economic impact is very high,'' said Delta Pride President
Sam I. Hinote.
   Ponds froze last weekend, some with 6 inches of ice, when
temperatures dipped into the single digits. When ponds freeze,
ammonia builds up and oxygen supplies dwindle, killing fish.
   Delta Pride's two processing plants in Indianola and one in
Belzoni shut down Tuesday. Officials at Country Skillet said they
halted operations at one plant and cut back operations at the other.
   Georgia Department of Natural Resource officials, meanwhile,
began sampling waters in the Brunswick area Thursday and are
expecting test trawls to net more dead shrimp than live shrimp as
they move up the coast this weekend.
   The news comes a week after the department announced that the
winter shrimping season, which normally ends Dec. 31, would be
extended at least into January because of a bountiful shrimp
supply. Biologist Gordon Rogers said if last weekend's freeze did
the damage the department suspects, officials could rescind that
announcement next week.
   ``At worst, it is our suspicion that there are no shrimp to be
worrying about catching,'' Rogers said, adding that the state's
prime white roe shrimp crop could be reduced for up to 18 months.
   White shrimp, which are caught in the spring, fall and winter,
annually account for 80 to 90 percent of the Georgia crop. Brown
shrimp harvested in the summer bring in 10 to 20 percent of the
annual crop.

   The White House on Friday turned up its
nose at advertisements for a decongestant featuring President Bush
and Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``Heads of state don't
endorse cold medicine,'' said Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater registered objections to ads for Drixoral, an
across-the-counter head cold remedy manufactured by Schering Corp.
   The ads, in both newspaper and television versions, show
Gorbachev and Bush shaking hands at the superpower summit in Malta
earlier this month.
   ``In the New Year, may the only cold war in the world be the one
we're fighting,'' asserts the advertisements.
   But the ads clearly are giving the White House a headache.
   ``We do not approve or sanction or acknowledge any of these
commercial endorsements and we appreciate the two television
networks that declined to run them,'' said Fitzwater.
   ABC and CBS have refused to carry the spot.
   ``Heads of state don't endorse cold medicine. Period,'' said
Fitzwater.
   ``Some ad man gets high marks for imagination and ingenuity, but
he may have to pay for this one himself,'' Fitzwater said. He did
not elaborate.

   A 19-year-old Illinois soldier killed in the U.S. invasion of
Panama was remembered today as a man who ``believed in what he was
doing,'' as his family and friends gathered for his funeral.
   More than 250 mourners attended a service at Moline, Ill., for
Army Pfc. Scott Lee Roth, one of 23 U.S. servicemen killed in the
invasion to oust Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The service for Roth was held one day after six soldiers killed
in the Panama action were buried in services around the country,
with mourners honoring their dedication to an effort that
``silenced an evil regime.''
   More than 40 military men in uniform attended today's service
for Roth.
   ``This is a man who wanted to be a soldier, loved being a
soldier and he believed in what he was doing,'' said Army Lt. Col.
Robert C. Pearson, a chaplain at the Rock Island Arsenal.
   Roth's wife, Mary _ his high school sweetheart who enlisted with
him after graduation _ attended the service with her family and a
military escort.
   Among those buried Thursday was Spec. Alejandro L.
Manriquelozano, the first of the dead from the invasion to be laid
to rest in Arlington National Cemetery.
   Manriquelozano, 30, was buried with military honors _ including
three rifle volleys and the playing of ``Taps'' _ in snow-covered
ground at Arlington within sight of the Capitol and Washington
Monument.
   Manriquelozano, a naturalized American citizen from Peru who
lived in Lauderhill, Fla., was an anti-tank gunner with D Company,
2nd Battalion, 504th Infantry, of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division.
   Manriquelozano's sister, Luz, who flew to Washington for the
funeral with other family members from Lima, Peru, told reporters,
``We are proud of him, because he always wanted to be an American.
His desire is fulfilled.''
   Col. James D. Weiskopf, public affairs officer of the Army
Military District of Washington, said Manriquelozano was the first
of the 23 servicemen listed as killed in Panama whose family had
requested burial at Arlington, although all are eligible.
   In Great Falls, Mont., Gov. Stan Stephens was among the nearly
300 mourners at the funeral of Pvt. 2 Vance Troy Coats, who died
when a grenade exploded in a Panama City neighborhood Dec. 20.
   ``His courageous commitment has silenced an evil regime,''
Stephens said. ``Thank you Troy Coats. Farewell son of Montana.
Rest in peace.''
   In the northern Wisconsin logging community of Conover, hundreds
of friends and relatives honored Pfc. John Mark Price, an Army
paratrooper from the 75th Rangers who would have turned 23 on
Christmas Eve.
   In a tear-filled eulogy attended by about 400 people at the
Evangelical Free Church, Tom Dillahunt, a close friend of Price,
held up a snapshot of the soldier.
   ``He was the gung-ho type, the energy behind any plans that were
made,'' Dillahunt said. ``He died doing what he loved best, being a
soldier. He died to protect us.''
   Another Army Ranger, 19-year-old Pfc. Roy Brown Jr., was buried
in Orange, Calif., and mourners were asked to lay the blame for his
death on Manuel Antonio Noriega, the deposed Panamanian dictator.
   ``Let us criticize the Noriegas, let us criticize the drug lords
... and let us criticize those that would endanger our freedom,''
Pastor Wiley Drake told more than 250 mourners.
   In Pennsylvania, several hundred mourners overflowed the United
Methodist Church of Hallstead for the funeral of a third Ranger,
Staff Sgt. Larry R. Barnard, 29.
   ``He was a guy who really believed in what he was doing,'' said
the Rev. Keith Benjamin, ``and believed in doing it right.''
   Barnard formerly belonged to the 82nd Airborne Division and
served in the U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   In Abilene, Texas, hundreds of relatives and friends turned out
for the funeral of native son Pfc. Martin D. Denson, 21, an
infantryman.
   Denson was buried at Elmwood Memorial Park with full military
honors and a 21-gun salute.

<HEAD>White House Says Vatican Doing `Fine Job'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs on State Department rejection of Vatican comment
after 5th graf, The spokesman's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The White House today sought to
make peace with the Vatican, asserting the Roman Catholic Church
was ``doing a fine job'' in its deliberations over the fate of
deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Antnio Noriega.
   It also said talks with church officials ``continue in a
positive vein'' and that no deadline had been set for resolving a
deadlock over Noriega's refuge in the Vatican's embassy in Panama
City.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater brushed aside the
Vatican's assertion that it had ``no obligation to turn over this
man to an occupying force'' and instead lavished praise on papal
authorities.
   ``It's a very difficult situation, very tense circumstances.
They are managing a difficult situation,'' Fitzwater told reporters
as President Bush continued to enjoy a hunting vacation on a ranch
near the south Texas community of Beeville.
   The spokesman's remarks were in contrast to earlier, more
assertive White House statements suggesting the United States was
forcefully pressing for Noriega's return to stand trial on
drug-trafficking charges in this country.
   While Fitzwater was soft-pedaling U.S.-Vatican tensions, State
Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher in Washington took
issue with a church spokesman's description of the United States as
an occupying power.
   ``We are down there with the consent of the government of
Panama, the legitimately elected leaders of Panama. That means
we're not an occupying power,'' Boucher said.
   On another subject, Fitzwater said he had no information to
impart on a report in today's editions of The Washington Times that
Noreiga had been tipped off 48 hours in advance of last Wednesday's
U.S. invasion. However, the spokesman said, ``He had an extensive
intelligence operation.''
   In any event, Fitzwater said, ``it's history now.''
   Apparently attempting to sooth increasingly harsh exchanges
between the United States and the Vatican over Noriega, Fitzwater
told reporters: ``I think the Vatican is doing a fine job. We
appreciate their efforts.''
   The Vatican had flatly said it would not turn over Noriega _
holed up in the Vatican embassy since Christmas Eve _ to the United
States.
   In a written statement today, the White House said: ``Our
discussions with Vatican officials continue in a positive vein. We
appreciate the papal nuncio's efforts to resolve the current
situation. We remain hopeful for a resolution of the problem and
there are no fixed deadlines to be met.''
   Fitzwater said he did not know if U.S. troops ringing the
Vatican embassy would now stop bombarding the building with
nerve-rattling rock music.
   But he said the administration clearly did not want to encourage
or aggravate any further confrontation with the Vatican.
   ``This matter has to play out,'' he said. ``We can't predict how
long it will take. We'll just go calmly along ....''
   Fitzwater had said Thursday it was up to Vatican officials to
break the stalemate over Noriega's fate, ``and we leave it to them
to work this out as they see fit.''
   Fitzwater today made it clear the White House was attempting to
seek to play down the entire matter. ``There's just not much that
we can say or want to say while this is going on,'' he said.
   In fact, even getting information from Bush and Secretary of
State James Baker III from the secluded ranch about 60 miles
northwest of here was proving to be a chore for Fitzwater.
   ``I called this morning for a report _ but they were out
hunting,'' he confessed.
   Bush planned to head later today for his adopted hometown of
Houston. He was to stay there through New Year's Day _ with a side
trip Sunday to two military hospitals in San Antonio to visit U.S.
servicemen wounded in Panama.
   In Washington, meanwhile, the Justice Department acknowledged it
failed to follow its own guidelines for considering national
security problems when it brought drug charges against Noriega.
   ``It now appears that there was some rush to draw up the Noriega
indictment'' and guidelines requiring a review of national security
implications ``may not have been completely followed,'' spokesman
David Runkel told reporters.
   He added, however, ``We believe there is a strong case against
General Noriega and that case can be successfully brought to
trial.''
   Concerns about disclosure of secrets in the Noriega case have
arisen from reports that he worked closely with the CIA and the
Pentagon while he served as the head of Panama's military
intelligence service and after he became commander-in-chief in 1983.
   Fitzwater, briefing reporters here Thursday, said it is still
too early to discuss a reduction in the 26,000 U.S. forces
stationed in Panama, even though the U.S.-installed government of
President Guillermo Endara appears to be ``continuing to expand its
control.''
   ``We'd like to have a drawdown as soon as possible, but we can't
tell you exactly when,'' with U.S. military forces still ringing
the Vatican embassy, he said.
   Fitzwater said the United States is no longer willing to allow
Noriega to travel to a third country where he would be shielded
from drug-trafficking charges that await him in Florida _ even
though Noriega had been offered such a deal privately by the
administration as recently as October.
   ``We had to go in militarily, we have paid a price for this, and
our objective is that we want him returned to the United States for
prosecution,'' he said.
   ``The difference is, before, the offer was if he would go in
peace, save lives and bloodshed and so forth, and he chose not to
do that,'' the spokesman said.

   Jane Pauley took leave of the ``Today'' show
Friday after 13 years as co-host, fighting back tears and promising
to keep up friendships with the program's regulars, including her
successor, Deborah Norville.
   ``I have to thank NBC for giving me this incredible front-row
seat for the last 13 years, and my colleagues for being more like
family and for making this studio feel like home,'' she said.
   Pauley announced in October that she intended to leave
television's longest-running network morning show. The announcement
came amid published speculation that she was being pushed out for
the younger, flashier Norville.
   Pauley said then and reiterated Friday that she and her
successor would continue to be friends. Pauley has extended her
contract with NBC to 1992 and will be involved in prime-time
programs beginning in March.
   Bryant Gumbel, ``Today'' co-host for the past eight years, said
to Pauley at the end of her final program: ``Consistency's a
treasured thing. You know where I stand.''
   ``Class act,'' was the parting comment from weatherman Willard
Scott.
   ``I never knew we'd be such good friends and I never knew I
would get the chance to continue the legacy that you've begun,''
Norville said.
   Tom Brokaw, who shared the spotlight with Pauley the first five
years of her run, said in a farewell film clip that her great
ability was ``that she can reach everyone from Robert DeNiro across
the middle of America into the heartland.''
   ``All the cliches about Jane are true _ she is the young woman
that you'd like to have as your daughter,'' Brokaw said.
   The film clips that took up much of the program's final
half-hour included Pauley in some of the estimated 12,000
interviews she conducted over the years, mugging with a fat cigar
and a bulbous clown's nose and taking a ribbing about her ballooned
shape late in a pregnancy.
   There also was a cavalcade of her coiffures during her ``Today''
career. A fan was shown saying that she could really identify with
Pauley because ``sometimes her hair really doesn't look too good.''
   But anthropologist Helen Fisher said each hairstyle showed
Pauley ``really senses her audience. It's not too sexy; she knows
this is a morning program. It's not too cute; she knows this is an
important program.''
   ``I look like Alice in Wonderland,'' a maturer and more assured
Pauley commented after watching her first appearance on the show in
1976 in which she acknowledged that ``one-and-a-half years ago Jane
Pauley was a second-string news reader in Indianapolis.''
   The 25-year-old Pauley was brought to New York to replace
Barbara Walters, the first woman host of the show.
   ``Today'' began in 1952 with Dave Garroway and Jack Lescoulie as
hosts.

<HEAD>NIH Scrapping Conflict-of-Interest Guidelines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health is scrapping
proposed conflict-of-interest guidelines that stirred controversy
among scientists and will go back to the drawing boards to draft
new options, officials said Friday.
   The guidelines proposed for the federal research agency last
September were an attempt to ensure the integrity of
government-funded projects by preventing researchers from having a
financial interest in the outcome of their work.
   But many scientists said the proposal would hamper efforts to
turn academic research into commercial products and could cost the
United States its competitive edge in biomedical research.
   The proposal suggested that NIH grant recipients disclose their
and their familiy's financial interests and said government-funded
researchers should have no equity interest in any company that
would benefit from their research. It also proposed barring
researchers from sharing information with companies until it is
publicly available.
   NIH received more than 600 comments on the proposal, said NIH
spokeswoman Ann Thomas.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services, said Friday that he has asked NIH to submit to him
new options ``that properly treat potential abuse while keeping the
research process free of unnecessary burdens and disincentives.''
   ``While there is a crucial need to protect against possible
abuses in the research system, it is also important that we not
impose on our scientific community regulatory burdens which may be
unnecessary or counterproductive,'' Sullivan said.
   ``Likewise, it is important that we not unnecessarily jeopardize
the international leadership position we have built up through
years of cooperative government and private investment,'' he said.
   He said any changes will be implemented through the formal
regulatory process, rather than as guidelines as the original
proposal suggested.

<HEAD>Father's Refusal To Believe Son Died Accidentally Leads To Murder
Arrest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who refused to believe his
son's death was an accident conducted an independent investigation
that has led to the arrest of a man for investigation of killing
the son.
   Richard Froio, 50, launched his own campaign to uncover the
truth about the death of his son, Rocco Froio, 32, an alcoholic who
lived on the streets.
   Rocco Froio's body was discovered Aug. 18 in Studio City. After
an autopsy revealed that he had died of a heroin overdose, Los
Angeles detectives ruled the death accidental and closed the case.
   But the elder Froio was suspicious because he knew his son had
not used drugs for seven years, said Detective Charles Barnes.
   Because of the father's diligence, police obtained information
needed to arrest John Bird, 37, a transient, authorities said.
   A preliminary hearing for Bird is scheduled for Tuesday on
charges he killed the younger Froio with an injection of heroin
while he was asleep or unconscious.
   The elder Froio posted a sign near where his son's body was
discovered, seeking information about the death.
   ``He was very dedicated and instrumental in the case,'' Deputy
District Attorney Guadalupe Y. Gonzalez said.
   ``The sign kept getting knocked down and he would pass by it and
put it up again,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. ``He wandered around and
talked to people, asking them if they knew his son. He was trying
to reconstruct his son's last moments.''
   The elder Froio received several calls from homeless people who
said Bird had injected his son with heroin while he was asleep or
passed out. He relayed the information to police, who arrested Bird
on Oct. 21.
   If convicted, Bird faces a maximum sentence of 30 years to life
in prison for murder and the sale and transportation of heroin,
authorities said.

   One branch of East Germany's biggest
opposition movement defied the coalition's leaders Friday and said
it would form a political party to challenge the Communists in
parliamentary elections.
   The military announced it was replacing its top-ranking officers
and said it had abolished the section in which the Communist Party
ensured obedience from the military.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Friday that he was told that East
Germany is considering reducing its defense spending by 20 percent
next year.
   The main body of New Forum, which claims membership of 200,000,
decided earlier this week to remain a citizens' group rather than
found a formal political party.
   New Forum activists from five East German cities, however, met
in Karl-Marx-Stadt and said they set up a committee to form the
German Forum Party, the official news agency ADN said. The new
party will hold its founding convention on Jan. 27 and run
candidates in the May elections, ADN said.
   There has been friction between New Forum founders, who are
mainly based in East Berlin, and the more radical members of the
group in the provinces.
   New Forum was formed as a loose group of opposition activists
just over two months ago, when the pro-democracy movement began
challenging the hard-line Communist leadership.
   The protests grew into massive street demonstrations that forced
the ouster of hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker, democratic
reforms and the resignation of the entire Communist leadership Dec.
3.
   In less the two months, East Germany opened the Berlin Wall and
other borders and embarked on the path of democratic reforms that
will culminate in the free elections.
   Late Thursday, New Forum's national council issued a platform
for the elections, but said it still considered itself only a
nationwide citizens' movement.
   The group said it was ready to assume political responsibility,
strived for a ``mixed economy,'' and supported ''a special
relationship'' with West Germany.
   New Forum said it will offer an alternative for citizens who did
not trust other established parties and their willingness to carry
out deep reforms. It said it supported a confederation with West
Germany.
   The East German offer to trim 20 percent of its defense budget
``could be very significant'' if it turns out to be true, said Sen.
Levin. Levin said the figure came out during a meeting with Defense
Minister Theodor Hoffmann.
   ``It adds evidence that there is a very significant reduction in
the threat from the East,'' said the senator, who added that lower
U.S. defense spending could be justified by the reforms being
introduced in Eastern Europe.
   East German officials had previously said the 1990 defense
budget would be at least 10 percent lower than the $13 billion
reported for this year.
   The Defense Ministry announced a series of new appointments that
take effect Monday.
   Ministry spokesman Uwe Hempel told ADN that Gen. Horst Bruenner
was retiring after the abolition of the political administration
department. The office dealt with ideological matters and ensured
Communist policies and ideology were observed in the military.
   The military also replaced the chief of staff and commanders of
the navy, air force and land forces.
   ADN gave no reason for the changes.

   Gov. Bob Martinez signed an executive
order Friday setting up a task force to coordinate study of the
mercury contamination that is threatening the state's rural
environment.
   Elevated levels of the toxic metal have been found in wildlife
such as Florida panthers, alligators, largemouth bass and turtles
throughout the state, said Forrest Ware, chief of the research
bureau of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   ``Mercury contamination could pose a very real, very dangerous
threat to public health, and we can't sit back and just hope for
things to get better,'' the governor said.
   The task force is to report to Martinez by March 1 with a plan
to deal with the contamination, including possible solutions.
   ``Basically, we're just identifying problems right now. Then we
can get to the how and why,'' he said.
   Health officials have warned people of possible contamination in
at least eight rivers across the state, including the St. Johns,
Suwanee and Yellow, as well as Lakes Kissimmee and Tohopekaliga.
   In the Everglades, mercury was blamed for the death of a
4-year-old Florida panther earlier this year.
   ``We haven't even looked at the birds yet or the marine life,''
Ware said. ``This has to be investigated.''
   One possible source of contamination could be natural. Peat
contains mercury that could be released through contact with acid
rain or after drought-triggered fires. Coal-fired power plants and
insecticides also are possible mercury sources.
   Task force members are the heads of the state departments of
Health and Rehabilitative Services, Agriculture and Consumer
Services, Environmental Regulation, Natural Resources, Marine
Fisheries Commission and the game commission.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Months ago, Vaclav Havel was a
prisoner of faceless men, jailed yet again for ``antisocial''
behavior in a system he called morally rotten.
   On Friday, he became president of Czechoslovakia.
   A playwright, Havel scripted much of the high drama which
brought the Communist Party off center stage after 41 years of
command performance.
   His work was banned after Soviet armor silenced the ``Prague
Spring'' of 1968. Writing in the shadows, publishing abroad, he
sliced away Communist underpinnings with strokes of his pen.
   Havel exposed the abyss between words and reality, hurling scorn
at the Orwellian spin on terms like ``people's democracy'' and
``socialism.''
   His goal, he said recently, was a ``modern contemporary system
which would return to people their honor and freedom.''
   Although Havel recently called the prime minister's job 10 times
more important than the president's, he is likely to loom large as
Czechoslovaks rediscover democracy.
   He revives a tradition of the philosopher president. His hero,
and the nation's, is Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, the professor and
author who in 1918 created Czechoslovakia from the ruins of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.
   Czechoslovaks, who love ideas eloquently expressed, have turned
frequently to intellectuals for guidance in times of crisis.
   At first glance, Havel appears less a president than a
53-year-old Dennis- the-Menace lookalike with a blond mustache.
Impish eyes gleam, and a half-amused smile leaves people wondering
what he is up to next.
   When he speaks, however, his gravely voice rumbles wit and
wisdom. He is small and shy, but his presence can fill a room.
   Four years in prison during the last 20 have edged Havel's
whimsy with flint. Mostly, he has often said, time alone with his
tormentors gave him a chance to weigh his values.
   His ``Letters To Olga,'' written from his cell to his wife and
published as a book, reveal a man putting his mind through rigorous
daily aerobics.
   Havel sweeps broadly from intense inner searching and musing in
foreign languages to mundane details of life. Characteristically,
he blends the extremes.
   In one letter, he warns Olga to fight when authorities cut off
her fuel. ``It's not just the heating oil,'' he wrote. ``This could
become a monstrous precedent. (Franz Kafka: Man is an eternal
rebel).''
   He urges her to care for their farmhouse, clearly the place to
which he longs to escape to craft the plays that nourish him.
   Havel's plays are only obliquely political. He targets the
unjust and the hypocritical, taking them apart with swift,
sometimes imperceptible razor cuts.
   In public comments, however, Havel was blunt as a hammer blow.
At his trial in February, given a final word in his own defense,
Havel denounced authorities who arrested people for laying flowers
at a patriot's memorial:
   ``I must say that words `anti-state' and `antisocialist' lost
any semantic meaning long ago, since during their long years of
wanton use, they became a perjorative label for all citizens who,
for various reasons, made the government feel uncomfortable.''
   Havel's parents were wealthy, but only until he was 5.
Communists took power and marked him as too bourgeois for higher
education. To be near the theater, he worked as a stagehand.
Eventually he earned a degree at night school.
   Like Shakespeare's Caesar, Havel refused laurels until they were
forced upon him by a nation chanting his name. In a Dec. 7 news
conference, he said:
   ``I have repeatedly said that my occupation is writer and that I
have no political ambitions. I don't feel myself to be a
professional politician. But I have always put the public interest
ahead of my own.
   ``And if, God help us, the situation should develop in such a
way that the only service I could render my country would be to do
this, then, of course, I would do it.''
   That was quickly the case.
   In the heady momentum of the November uprising, the opposition
wanted a balanced government that would steer the nation quickly
toward free elections.
   The Communist premier resigned. His successor haggled with
opposition leaders, including Havel, over a cabinet. President
Gustav Husak, under an ultimatum, stepped down. A general strike
was averted. Czechoslovakia needed a leader.
   At a Dec. 9 rally, it was Havel on a balcony over Wenceslas
Square who listed each triumph of the people. He thundered, ``Love
and love must prevail over lies and hatred.'' The crowd of 100,000
roared, ``We want Havel.''
   Havel's sudden emergence was not a total surprise. As the crisis
widened, mysterious Hungarian-made ``Havel for President'' buttons
popped up all over Prague.
   Asked about them at the news conference, Havel shrugged. ``I
don't wear one,'' he said, skillfully evading three follow-up
questions on whether he approved of them.
   He was red-eyed and falling-down tired, but his answers were all
Havel. When someone taxed him for squirming away from direct
questions, he laughed.
   ``You talk of the presidency but don't accept the basic
presidential quality of answering in a roundabout way,'' he said.
He had seen George Bush in action, he added. ``I so far have not
said, `No comment.'''
   More seriously, he underlined the character of a revolution by a
strong people who finally had enough of something they did not
believe in.
   ``What is important,'' he said, ``is what the students began
with, that is, the humanitarian dimension, resistance to violence,
the longing for truth and moral integrity.''
   One reporter asked him to list the lessons he had drawn from 20
years of standing up to the state. He reflected a moment and
replied:
   ``I have learned that when a person behaves in accordance with
his conscience, and when he tries to speak the truth, behave as a
citizen even when citizenship as such is degraded, it may not lead
to anything, but it might.
   ``What certainly will not lead to anything is when you calculate
that it might.''

   Britain on Saturday gave author V.S. Naipaul a
knighthood, made actress Maggie Smith a dame and honored police and
rescue workers in the search for victims of bombed Pan Am Flight
103.
   The colony of Hong Kong, to return to Chinese sovereignty in
1997, also was heavily represented on Queen Elizabeth II's
semiannual honors list, which is compiled by the government. The
queen carries out the investiture of the honors at a later ceremony.
   Former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, whose
anti-nuclear stance put him at odds with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, was made a companion of honor, a prestigious order headed
by the queen and never numbering more than 65 members.
   Lange, 47, resigned in August after five years as head of a
Labor government, citing health reasons.
   Naipaul, 57, a Trinidad-born writer, was made a Knight Bachelor.
The author of ``In a Free State,'' ``A Bend in the River'' and
``Enigma of Arrival'' came to Britain at age 17 on a scholarship to
Oxford University and has become one of this country's most
important writers.
   The honor entitles him to call himself Sir Vidiadhar, but his
work always appears with his initials.
   Descended from an Indian family that emigrated to Trinidad as
indentured laborers, Naipaul grew up in a tightly knit Hindu
family. This background is reflected in his writing about
rootlessness and being an alien, even when visiting his ancestral
home in India, which he described in ``An Area of Darkness.''
   Maggie Smith, 55, one of Britain's finest stage actresses and an
Oscar-winner for ``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' was made a Dame
Commander of the Order of British Empire, the equivalent of a
knighthood for a woman.
   Another actor honored was actor Michael Gambon, most widely
known to television audiences for his lead role in the mini-series
``The Singing Detective.'' Gambon, 49, was made a CBE, or Commander
of the British Empire.
   Many of the 947 awards made in the New Year list went to
emergency service staff who worked at Lockerbie, Scotland, after a
bomb exploded on Flight 103 and the plane crashed Dec. 21, 1988,
killing 270 people.
   A Queen's Police Medal went to Inspector George Stobbs, a local
policeman who consoled many of the American relatives who arrived
at the remote Scottish village.
   John Boyd, the former chief constable of the Dumfries and
Galloway Constabulary, was made a CBE.
   A Queen's Police Medal went to Superintendent Angus Kennedy of
Strathclyde police, responsible for relations between the police
and the news media the night of the disaster, who was honored for
``his calm and immensely professional manner ... under the quite
exceptional pressures from the media on that night.''
   Kennedy heard of his honor after a 70-year-old neighbor cycled
two miles in a gale to his vacation cottage on the Hebridean island
of Coll to summon him the phone.
   ``This comes as a surprise and a very great honor,'' Kennedy
said.
   More than 20 honors went to Hong Kong residents, topped by a
knighthood for Justice Derek Cons of the Hong Kong court of Appeal.
There was a CBE for Li Kwan-ha, the colony's police commissioner
and nine awards for public and community service.
   The issue of British residence rights for Hong Kong citizens
worried by the prospect of Chinese rule, is becoming a very sore
point for the government. Many feel Britain's limited immigration
policy is elitist, but many in Mrs. Thatcher's own party feel it is
too liberal.

<HEAD>Indicator of Economic Activity Shows Tiny Rise for November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday that its chief
barometer of future economic activity edged up 0.1 percent in
November, a tiny increase seen by many analysts as evidence that
growth in 1990 will be modest at best.
   The Commerce Department said the small rise in its Index of
Leading Economic Indicators followed a 0.3 percent decline in
October, a figure that had originally been reported as a somewhat
larger 0.4 percent drop.
   For most of the year, the leading index has been flashing
signals that the U.S. economy was headed for a rather dramatic
slowdown in growth and analysts said the weak November showing did
not change that picture.
   ``The message is no growth and flirtation with a recession as we
enter the 1990s,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at
an annual rate of just over 3 percent through the first nine months
of this year.
   However, a variety of factors including a steep plunge in auto
sales, the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo are all
expected to depress economic activity significantly in the current
October-December quarter.
   Sinai is among a minority of economists who believe growth will
be negative in the fourth quarter and the first three months of
1990 as the country suffers through what he believes will be a mild
recession.
   However, less pessimistic forecasters are calling for weak
growth in both quarters and no recession as the current recovery
from the 1981-82 recession chugs into its eighth year, a peacetime
record.
   To bolster their view, they point out that while the leading
index has declined in five of the last 11 months, it has not fallen
for three consecutive months, the traditional, though not
infallible, signal of an impending downturn.
   ``After a weak start, we expect 1990 to pick up some strength
during the course of the year,'' said David Wyss, senior financial
economist for DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   He predicted GNP growth in the current quarter would register an
anemic 0.5 percent annual rate but would improve modestly in coming
quarters. For all of 1990, he forecast the GNP would expand by 1.6
percent, just about half of the growth this year.
   That would be bad news for the Bush administration, which is
counting on much stronger growth next year to bring in enough
revenues to reduce the deficit without requiring a tax increase.
The administration is expected to unveil its $1.2 trillion budget
proposal on Jan. 22.
   The 0.1 percent rise in the leading index in November was led by
a strong jump in orders for consumer goods.
   The other four indicators providing strength were a drop in
weekly unemployment claims, an increase in plant and equipment
orders, a rise in the money supply and an increase in the backlog
of manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   Six other indicators acted as a drag on the index last month,
with the biggest negative coming from a drop in the price of raw
materials. While such a decrease is considered good news for
inflation prospects, it is counted as a negative in the index
because it also can reflect declining demand.
   Other negative factors were a decline in stock prices, a drop in
consumer confidence, a decline in the average manufacturing work
week, a decline in building permits and a speedup in business
delivery times.
   The various changes left the index at 144.7 percent of its 1982
base of 100.
   One of the main reasons that analysts are looking for an upturn
in activity next year is a belief that credit-easing moves by the
Federal Reserve will provide a boost to interest-rate sensitive
sectors of the economy such as housing.
   But William MacReynolds, forecasting director of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said that the big rise in the money supply in
November, a sign of the Fed's easing efforts, was troubling because
it raised the danger of higher inflation next year.
   ``For the past six months, the money supply has increased much
faster than industrial output. This will lower the purchasing power
of money, causing a new bout of inflation to take hold,'' he said.

<HEAD>Priest Says Execution was Right Punishment for Ceausescu</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laszlo Toekes, the ethnic Hungarian
priest whose pending arrest unleashed the revolt that led to the
overthrew of Nicolae Ceausescu, says death was the right punishment
for the Romanian dictator.
   But Toekes, in an interview published Thursday, said it was
wrong to show the bodies of Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, on
television.
   West Germany's mass-circulation newspaper Bild Zeitung said it
interviewed Toekes on the train between Cluj and Bucharest, where
he would assume a role in the new leadership.
   ``They have proposed me for a minister (post). But I'm first of
all a priest, not a politician. However, if that's what the people
want, I will say yes,'' Toekes was quoted as saying.
   Asked if execution was the right punishment for Ceausescu and
his wife, Toekes was quoted as replying:
   ``The punishment was right. But it was horrible and disgraceful
to show both of them in such a way on television. To show their
death in full publicity, that's just not done.''
   The revolt against Ceausescu began in the western city of
Timisoara, when people linked hands around the priest's home to
prevent him from being taken away. It quickly spread into an
anti-Ceausescu uprising, with security forces opening fire on the
demonstrators. The protests spread nationwide and resulted in
Ceausescu's overthrow Dec. 22 and his execution Monday.
   Toekes described how he was tortured by Ceausescu's security
forces, the dreaded Securitate.
   ``Securitate people beat me in front of the altar of the church.
They hit me with sticks, they kicked me in front of the cross. They
dragged me off to Mineu. Fifty people watched me, floodlights shone
on the house day and night, guard dogs were in front of the door,''
Toekes was quoted as saying.
   He said his pregnant wife also was beaten by Ceausescu's
henchmen.
   The priest said he was feeling ``relatively good'' now. ``I have
great spiritual pains. Only now am I aware of the great danger that
my wife and son had been in. My life was not worth anything.''
   ``For Ceausescu, I had already been dead. .... I can only thank
God that I'm still alive,'' Bild quoted Toekes as saying.
   Toekes said he did not feel like a hero.
   ``I am a priest who had a duty. I am a very simple man. I only
did my duty conscientiously. I am not a hero,'' he said.
   Toekes said the high price in human life paid for overthrowing
Ceausescu had ``given my life some value.''
   ``Many people died because of me. That's painful. They only
wanted to help me. Securitate accused me of being responsible for
their death. My soul is destroyed,'' Toekes was quoted as saying.
   Toekes said his ``greatest wish'' was to go back to Timisoara as
soon as possible and celebrate a service with his parishioners.

   The White House on Friday turned up
its nose at advertisements for a decongestant featuring President
Bush and Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``Heads of state don't
endorse cold medicine,'' Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater registered objections to ads for Drixoral, an
over-the-counter head cold remedy manufactured by Schering-Plough
Corp.
   The ads, in both newspaper and television versions, show
Gorbachev and Bush shaking hands at the superpower summit in Malta
earlier this month.
   ``In the New Year, may the only cold war in the world be the one
we're fighting,'' asserts the advertisements.
   But the ads clearly are giving the White House a headache.
   ``We do not approve or sanction or acknowledge any of these
commercial endorsements and we appreciate the two television
networks that declined to run them,'' said Fitzwater.
   ABC and CBS have refused to carry the spot.
   ``Some ad man gets high marks for imagination and ingenuity, but
he may have to pay for this one himself,'' Fitzwater said. He did
not elaborate.

<HEAD>Indian Publisher Returns H.L. Mencken Award In Wake of Racist Comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH KEENAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sioux publisher of the Lakota Times
said Friday he has returned the H.L. Mencken Writing Award he won
in 1985 because of racist and sexist remarks Mencken made in his
recently published diaries.
   ``I feel very strongly that everything that I have fought for in
the last 20 years to try and improve race relations ... it just
wouldn't wash if I accepted an award and kept an award from a
person that has attitudes that are so bigoted.'' said Tim Giago, a
member of the Oglala Sioux tribe.
   His weekly paper is named for the dominant Sioux language.
   ``I have a strong feeling that this kind of subtle racism, by
people that are in a position to help, is probably the worst form
of racism.
   ``We can deal with outright, blatant, redneck racism because
it's right there in front of us,'' he said. ``But it is very hard
to deal with that kind of racism by people in prominent positions,
especially in the media, that carry this silent racial attitude
with them.''
   Giago, of Rapid City, said he also will return the $2,500 prize
that came with the award.
   Mencken, the famous columnist for The Sun of Baltimore, wrote
his diaries between 1930 and 1948. Publication was withheld until
more than 25 years after his death in 1956.
   Giago writes a weekly syndicated column on Indian issues for 20
newspapers across the country. He said he doubted others who
attended the ceremony with him five years ago, such as Coretta
Scott King, the wife of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., would have taken part if they had known about Mencken's
attitudes toward blacks, women and Jews.
   In one entry, Mencken wrote: ``It is impossible to talk anything
resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all
essentially child-like and even hard experience does not teach them
anything.''
   A spokesman for the Baltimore Sun, which sponsors the award,
said Friday neither Publisher Reg Murphy nor other senior
management at the newspaper were available for comment.
   Murphy wrote in Editor and Publisher recently that he had
considered ending the awards because of the diaries, but decided
against it.
   ``You don't throw away all of the wonderful work of a man like
Mencken that was in the public domain because of the private
venom,'' he wrote in the trade magazine.
   Another Mencken award recipient, Chicago Tribune columnist Mike
Royko, told the Sioux Falls Argus Leader he does not plan to return
his award because of Mencken's private thoughts.

<TEXT>
   An alleged rape and kidnap victim was
jailed at the request of a prosecutor after she failed to appear to
testify during the scheduled trial of an ex-convict charged in her
attack.
   The 24-year-old woman was ordered jailed Thursday as a material
witness. The woman's lawyer said she remained in custody Friday.
   Prosecutor Eric A. Larsen, a deputy Pima County attorney, said
Thursday he regretted having the woman jailed but feared she would
leave the state and not be available to testify against the
defendant.
   Larsen said the woman missed the first scheduled rape trial and
also missed her arraignment on an unrelated drug charge.
   Superior Court Judge Pro Tem Howard Hantman ordered the woman
held as a material witness and set a $5,000 bond for her. He
scheduled a hearing Tuesday before Superior Court Judge Nanette
Warner.
   The woman is the key witness in the case against Stantley Welch,
28, of Tucson, who was charged with burglary, kidnapping, attempted
sexual assault, sexual assault and aggravated assault.
   Welch is accused of assaulting the woman at her rented home at
about midnight on June 11 after visiting earlier in the day to
inquire about the sale of the house, according to court records.
   When the woman did not appear in court Dec. 12 to testify in
Welch's trial, scheduled to start that day, Ms. Warner dismissed
the charges against Welch without prejudice, meaning they could be
refiled.
   ``On the date of the trial, she failed to appear after assuring
the state that she would,'' Larsen wrote in a motion to hold the
woman as a material witness.
   Larsen's motion also said the woman threatened on Dec. 21 to
leave the state if she were released. That was the date she was
arrested on an unrelated drug charge.
   Ms. Warner had given prosecutors 60 days to locate the woman and
refile charges before the charges would be dismissed with
prejudice, meaning they could not be refiled.
   Larsen said Friday his office was preparing to refile the
charges against Welch but had not yet done so.
   In the drug case, the woman was indicted in November by a county
grand jury on a charge of unlawfully possessing a dangerous drug _
methamphetamines, according to court records.
   She was released from jail after being arrested Dec. 21 on a
warrant stemming from her failure to appear in the drug case, but
she was taken into custody again Thursday when she appeared before
Hantman in the rape case.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested a school drug counselor
found with apparent cocaine residue, as well as glass pipes and
other items considered drug paraphernalia, in his pickup truck, a
police spokesman said.
   Clyde Tillman, 56, was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of
possession of narcotics paraphernalia, said Dee Anderson of the
Arlington police.
   Tillman, a former high school football coach and longtime
employee of the Fort Worth school district, was released Thursday
from the Arlington City Jail on a personal recognizance bond, a
jail spokeswoman said.
   Police will seek a felony charge of possession of a controlled
substance if tests show the residue is cocaine and is a usable
amount under state law, Anderson said.
   Phone calls Friday to Tillman's residence were not answered.
   ``I am kind of in shock here,'' his supervisor, Billy Whitworth,
said after learning Thursday about Tillman's arrest. ``He has been
a good employee.''
   Tillman works in the district headquarters, dealing with
students who are chronically absent and break drug rules, Whitworth
said.
   ``If the student has broken the drug policy, they are referred
to him and he refers them to a drug counselor,'' Whitworth said.
``He talks to them first about their problem.''
   Tillman was arrested in Arlington, which is just east of Fort
Worth, after a police officer spotted his pickup under a tree by
Lake Arlington in an area known as a dumping ground for stolen
cars, Anderson said. The officer noticed Tillman shuffling things
around on the pickup's floor.
   Tillman told the officer he had come to the lake to ``drink a
beer and enjoy the scenery,'' Anderson said.
   The officer noticed a mirror and razor blade on the seat,
Anderson said. The officer also found a cloth bag under the seat
that contained glass pipes commonly used to smoke crack cocaine.
   A propane torch, which cocaine smokers sometimes use to heat
hardened cocaine, was found on the floor along with an empty
miniature plastic bag, police said.
   Schools Superintendent Don Roberts said Tillman probably will be
suspended with pay until the case is decided.
   ``There are about 7,800 employees in this district and they are
subject to a lot of things that society in general is exposed to,''
Roberts said.

<TEXT>
   An explosion and gas fire at a Consolidated
Edison Co. plant sent flames and black smoke hundreds of feet over
the East River today, injured at least four people and blacked out
at least 128,000 customers.
   ``The lights dimmed really quickly, and then I heard a big
blast,'' said Frank Wiles, 25, who works at a coal yard across the
street from the plant. ``I have two trailers in the yard and it
violently shook them. You could see bricks or debris landing around
the area.''
   The power outages caused extensive transit problems in the
nation's largest city.
   Within an hour after the fire was reported at the Hellgate
Station at 1:10 p.m. in the Bronx, it went to five alarms. By 2:15
p.m., workers had shut off a valve on a gas main that was feeding
the fire and the 10-story flames subsided.
   ``When the valve was turned, the flames got smaller and smaller
and smiles got bigger and bigger,'' said Paul Laddomada, 41, who
works for the Department of Environmental Protection a half-mile
from plant.
   Police Lt. Raymond O'Donnell said a Con Ed crew was working
behind the station when a gas line was ruptured. He said at least
four people were injured.
   At least one man was in critical condition after he was blown
into the river by the explosion, then fished out by rescuers
working in temperatures just below freezing, police said.
   The cause of the fire was undetermined, said Pat Richardi, a Con
Ed spokeswoman.
   The Hellgate facility formerly served as a generating station
then became a switching station and crossover point for electric
and gas lines, she said.
   Electricity was cut off to 58,000 customers in the Bronx and
70,000 on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Con Ed said. The loss of
electricity stopped subway service throughout the Bronx and all the
way to the southern tip of Manhattan.
   A fire official said diesel fuel tanks at an adjacent bus
station were in danger of exploding, and that some may have
exploded.
   The Transit Authority evacuated its 800 to 900 people from a
depot about two blocks from the Hellgate Station, disrupting bus
service on at least 12 routes, said Caren Gardner, a TA spokeswoman.
   There was ``a massive rolling fire and explosion. The heat is so
intense that you can't get within two blocks and police have set up
barricades three blocks away,'' Gardner said.

   A fire set under cover of darkness
heavily damaged a Planned Parenthood clinic Friday, a police
official said. There were no injuries.
   Firefighters and police were called to the clinic near an
intersection with Interstate 70 in this city just east of Kansas
City at 3:15 a.m., said Sgt. Al Neinas. The fire was confined to
the building's lobby, which was destroyed.
   A flammable liquid was used to start the fire, Neinas said.
Investigators did not have suspects or a motive, he said.
   Attacks on the clinic, which does not provide abortions, have
escalated recently, according to Patty Brous, director of
development for Planned Parenthood of Kansas City. A shotgun was
fired through a window and a fire was set outside the clinic, which
has been the target of picketing, Brous said.
   The clinic provides family planning services, birth control,
pregnancy tests and treatment of sexual diseases.

<TEXT>
   Farmers can sign up in a new ``0-25'' program
for 1990-crop soybeans Jan. 16 through Feb. 16, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   The program will enable farmers to plant soybeans on as much as
25 percent of their permitted acreages for 1990 wheat, feed grains,
cotton and rice. Sunflowers and safflowers also may be planted but
will not require a formal signup.
   If farmers choose to participate in the new program, the acreage
in soybeans will still be considered planted to the other
commodities for crop history purposes, said Dan Shaw, acting vice
president of the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   Following the signup, the department will estimate how 1990
soybean prices may respond. If prices are indicated at less than
$4.98 per bushel _ 110 percent of the price support loan rate of
$4.53 _ the USDA ``will reduce or eliminate all or a portion'' of
the permitted acreage than can be planted to soybeans under the
program, he said.
   Producers can get further information from county offices of the
department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service,
Shaw said.

   Thousands of secret police loyal to
Nicolae Ceausescu's shattered regime were reported in custody
Friday and the new government said it would begin steering the
country toward democracy.
   The revolutionary government also said that it has begun putting
secret police on trial.
   The government, a disjointed collection of former officials and
intellectuals that has changed almost daily, made new moves to
strengthen its hold on the country and reiterated its commitment to
free elections in April.
   The leadership also changed the country's name and flag to
reflect the clean break with Ceausescu's harsh Communist rule,
which was toppled one week ago after 24 years of oppression.
   The National Salvation Committee, which has declared itself the
interim government, pledged to honor all of Romania's international
commitments, including membership in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
military alliance.
   The government had told Ceausescu loyalists still waging
sporadic guerrilla attacks to lay down their arms by 5 p.m.
Thursday or face execution.
   Cazimir Ionescu, a vice president in the National Salvation
Committee's 145-member governing council, said Friday that several
thousand loyalists had surrendered or been captured in the week
since Ceausescu was toppled.
   The government's newly formed Military Council issued a ``last
call'' for surrender or else the pro-Ceausescu forces will face
trial and be ``summarily sentenced.''
   The council said the army was ``in full control'' nationwide and
that military tribunals set up to put the special police forces on
trial had begun their work ``and will continue to try all acts of
terrorism.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Cornelieu Bogdan said he hoped the
trials would involve ``due process,'' but said he did not know how
defendants would be judged.
   ``The death penalty may be abolished by then,'' he said.
   He said the prisoners included some generals and high-ranking
officers.
   There was scattered shooting in the capital Thursday night, but
Bogdan said ``the main danger from the terrorists,'' has passed.
   A snowstorm and high winds swept Bucharest on Friday. A column
of about 20-30 tanks was seen rolling through the center of town
with soldiers waving at people as they passed.
   The provisional leadership announced it would honor all
international commitments, ``including those taken under the Warsaw
Pact,'' Bogdan said.
   The country's new leaders are likely to meet the leaders of the
six other Warsaw Pact countries for the first time in Sofia,
Bulgaria, on Jan. 9, when the Soviet-led Eastern trading bloc
Comecon meets.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu reportedly became friends with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev when both were college students
in Moscow.
   It will be the first time the leaders of the seven East bloc
countries will meet since all of those countries have embraced
democratic reforms.
   On Friday, Iliescu and interim Premier Petre Roman met with
Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn to discuss possible Hungarian
aid. Horn was the first foreign minister to visit Bucharest since
the revolution.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed Monday for grave
crimes against Romania.
   The couple was captured Dec. 23, then shuttled about in a
constantly moving armored car for the last three days of their
lives, Britain's Independent Television News said. It quoted Capt.
Mihail Lupoi, identified as a senior army official, as saying that
Ceausescu was kept in the moving car to prevent rescue attempts.
   Lupoi also said Ceausescu was a diabetic but refused to take his
daily insulin does during his last days.
   Meanwhile, Romania's former defense minister was given a hero's
funeral on Friday. Gen. Vasile Milea died of a gunshot wound Dec.
22, senior officers have said.
   Before fleeing his palace in the face of revolt, Ceausescu had
denounced Milea and claimed he had committed suicide. But Romania's
new leaders say he was executed for refusing to order army troops
to fire on demonstrators. The army ultimately sided with the
protesters to drive Ceausescu from power.
   Milea's funeral in a small hall at the Military Academy was
shown on national TV.
   The new leadership has received support and recognition from
several Western countries and a special envoy of French President
Francois Mitterrand met Friday with First Deputy President Dumitru
Mazilu.
   The leadership, in a communique issued late Thursday, pledged to
abolish one-party rule and establish a democratic, multiparty
system and hold free elections in April.
   It also called for a free press and minority and religious
rights; changed the country's official name from the Socialist
Republic of Romania to Romania; and removed the communist symbol
from the flag.
   The government on Thursday also appointed new ministers, with a
special focus on the economy.
   But the government also said it had the right to issue decrees
that carry the force of law. Bogdan said such power was needed to
maintain order.
   Ionescu also defended the former Communist leaders in the new
interim leadership, saying they are needed to get the country back
on its feet.
   ``Many Communist Party members are indispensible,'' he said.
   Because Ceausescu took the toughest line in Eastern Europe on
dissent, Romania was never able to develop the dissident network
that formed the core of opposition movements in Hungary, East
Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   Dissidents in those nations all play a key role in the
government. On Friday, dissident playwright Vaclav Havel was
elected president of Czechoslovakia.
   Already this week, several political parties announced their
formation.

Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Albania, the last bastion of Stalinism in
Eastern Europe, has protested criticism of its human rights
policies by the Greek foreign minister, Greece said Friday.
   An official statement said the Greek charge d'affaires was
summoned Thursday to the Foreign Ministry in Tirana, the Albanian
capital, to explain why Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras had made
the statement.
   Samaras commented Monday, saying with the fall of Romanian
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, all nations should recognize the time
had come for dialogue and human rights.
   ``And in the same way that Christmas is being celebrated in
Romania today, I hope that soon we will be able to see the Greek
Christian minority, the Greeks of Albania, celebrating Christmas in
Albania,'' he said.
   The remarks by Samaras, a member of the conservative New
Democracy Party, were criticized by Greece's socialists and
Communists who also support the government.
   Greece in 1987 ended a technical state of war with neighboring
Albania that had lingered from World War II.
   The Orthodox Church of Greece sharply attacked the decision at
the time by describing it as an ``abandonment of our Christian
brothers.''
   Ethnic Greeks are banned from speaking Greek and practicing
their religion in Albania, a hard-line Communist country of 3
million people that has shut itself off from the outside years for
most of the postwar years.
   Samaras, a member of the conservative New Democracy Party, said
later that ``no Greek wishes it to remain the last unprotected
minority in a Europe (that stands) for human rights.''
   The Orthodox Church of Greece claims 400,000 Greeks live in the
tiny, rugged country on Greece's northwestern frontier. But Albania
says the number of ethnic Greeks do not exceed 60,000.
   With the fall of hard-line Communist governments in Poland,
Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and now Romania,
rumors spread through the Balkans that some unrest was noted in
Albania. But Tirana denied that any demonstrations against its rule
had taken place.
   Albanian Embassy officials in Athens were evasive when asked to
discuss the situation in their country.
   One Greek Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Greece's embassy in Tirana has reported nothing
unusual going on.
   Sources in northwestern Greece said security on the Albanian
side of the border remains tight with no noticeable change in the
past week. One main road was open for trucks carrying goods between
the two countries.
   Analysts who closely follow events in the isolated Communist
state said they had received no reports of unrest and it appeared
unlikely that the hard-line government of President Ramiz Alia
would be affected by what has occurred in Eastern Europe.
   Alia took power fie years ago following the death of longtime
dictator Enver Hoxha, who broke relations with the Soviet Union in
1961 because of Nikita S. Khrushchev's dismantling of Stalinism.
Museums and monuments in Tirana honor Hoxha amid the shabby
apartment blocks he left behind.
   Secret police check Albanians' contacts with foreigners.
   Albania has accepted only about 10,000 tourists a year, and
diplomats have said that Albanian officials are petrified that
affluent Westerners might raise discontent among the poorest people
in the continent. Thousands of households, lacking any other source
of heat, burn dung and garbage.
   An announcement in Paris earlier this week by a group of
Albanian refugee associations criticized the international
community's inattention to rights abuses in Albania.
   ``From purge to purge,'' it said, ``all of Albania has become a
veritable prison camp, and basic human rights have been violated
since 1945.''

   On a freezing evening three days before
Christmas, the Harris family received the last visitor they would
ever see.
   One after another, Tony and Delores Harris, 15-year-old Shelby
and 11-year-old Marc were tied up and shot in the head, then doused
with gasoline and set on fire.
   Their partly charred bodies were discovered the next morning,
Dec. 23, after a neighbor heard a smoke alarm. Police said there
was no sign that an intruder had forced entry to the house.
   ``These were very outgoing people who would open the door to
anyone,'' said state police Capt. Carl Shaver.
   Police have not publicly suggested a motive. State troopers and
FBI agents have been at the Harris home all week, searching for
evidence and questioning neighbors.
   A brown and tan van was taken from the Harrises' garage; it was
discovered later in the parking lot of a nearby mall. Police have
said they are looking for a bicyclist who was seen riding along
Ellis Hollow Road shortly before nightfall on Dec. 22.
   Christmas wreaths and red ribbons still flutter from the
doorways of the gray, two-story house, and a white wooden sign
shaped like a goose reads ``Welcome Friends.'' Inside, unopened
Christmas packages lie under the tree.
   The Harrises lived in Ellis Hollow, an affluent section in the
rural town of Dryden, a quiet neighborhood set between forested
hills about five miles from downtown Ithaca in western New York
state.
   Residents say they can't remember much more than a burglary or
two in recent years, and Tompkins County Sheriff Robert Howard says
there hasn't been a murder there ``in a long, long time.''
   People left their doors unlocked and neighbors watched each
other's children.
   ``About the worst thing that happens here is a car accident in
the winter,'' said Pat De Mane, who lives two houses from the
Harrises.
   Residents now peer cautiously through their windows before
answering the door.
   People described the Harrises as active and well-liked in the
community.
   ``You can't think of anyone that would have a grudge against
them,'' said Ann Parziale, a friend of Mrs. Harris. ``To do
something like this _ you're really speechless.''
   The family moved to Ellis Hollow in 1986, when Harris, who would
have turned 40 this week, was named sales director of Deanco, a
Syracuse-based electronic equipment distributor. Mrs. Harris'
father built the large frame house for them, friends said.
   Delores ``Dodie'' Harris, 41, knew everyone and organized pie
bees and cookie exchanges. She was active in the PTA and the Ellis
Hollow board, and she opened a crafts and gift shop, ``The Grey
Goose,'' in a barn next to the house because she was worried about
not having enough to do, Parziale said.
   ``She enjoyed meeting people and knowing people,'' Parziale
added. ``If there was a job to be done, she would do it. When no
one wanted to put out the PTA directory, Dodie did it.''
   Mrs. Harris had planned a party for her husband's birthday on
Saturday, the day funeral services for the family will be held.
   The couple were very involved in their children's lives,
Parziale said, going out of town to watch Shelby's tennis matches
and Marc's hockey games and getting to know their friends.
   ``They were very careful about where Shelby babysat ... they
knew her friends and her boyfriend,'' she said. ``The kids were not
home alone a lot.''
   ``People can't understand how it could happen,'' she said.
``This is a very wholesome, family-oriented community.''
   ``Those things aren't supposed to happen here, in this
community,'' said Edgar Clemens, a retired schoolteacher who has
lived on Ellis Hollow Road for 26 years.
   ``I don't think anybody around here slept Saturday night,'' said
one neighbor who said she was afraid to give her name. ``We're all
pretty nervous around here.
   ``I've opened the door to people whose cars have broken down. I
don't think I'll do that any more.''

   As Czechoslovakia looks toward
free elections next year for the first time in four decades, 11 new
political parties have emerged.
   Those already established are expected to attract large numbers
of new members as people take advantage of the right to join
political parties denied by Communists for 41 years.
   The parties:
   _ Communist Party. After four decades of a virtual monopoly on
power, enshrined in Czechoslovakia's Constitution, the Communists
are by far the best organized. However, the party is on the verge
of bankruptcy and has lost more than 66,000 of its 1.7 million
members since the peaceful revolution began in mid-November.
   During the decades of Communist control, only four small
political parties survived, the Socialist Party, the People's Party
and two parties in Slovakia considered relics of Czechoslovakia's
prewar democracy.
   All of them recognized Communist rule in their statutes and
cooperated with the Party.
   Within the party is a potential splinter group, the Democratic
Forum of Communists. This group of reform-minded party members is
organizing nationally and has threatened to leave the party at its
forthcoming congress in May 199O.
   Such a break would further reduce the Communist Party's already
greatly diminished political influence.
   _ The Socialist Party evolved from the Czech Socialist Party
after the Communist takeover in 1948. It has 18 deputies in the
350-member parliament, and publishes the widely read daily Svobodne
Slovo.
   Two of the new government ministers are Socialists.
   Membership in the Socialist Party has stagnated at about 16,000
but in the current political landscape the party is expected to
attract new members.
   _ The People's Party traditionally attracts Catholics and other
religious Czechoslovaks. It has 47,000 members and holds 19 seats
in parliament.
   Two members of the new cabinet are members of the People's Party.
   Before the revolution, both the Socialists and the People's
Party were docile partners of the Communists with membership quotas
keeping them out of real competition.
   But they are emerging as viable contenders for the upcoming
elections, distancing themselves from the Communists and siding
with the democratic opposition. The People's Party was the party to
propose Havel for president in parliament.
   It is difficult to estimate membership in the smaller political
parties and groups, as the political terrain shifts with new
parties emerging daily. It is unlikely that any will be able to
organize and attract a large number of members before the first
elections.
   Among the smaller parties are:
   _ The Czechoslovak Social-Democratic Party.
   _ Czechoslovak Democratic Initiative.
   _ The Green Party.
   _ The Czechoslovak Agricultural Party.
   _ The Christian Democratic Party.
   _ The Trend for the Third Millenium.
   _ The Permanent Opposition for Democracy.
   _ The Party of Free Democrats, created Friday.
   The strongest political force in the country, however, is not a
political party.
   Civic Forum, founded by former dissident and new President
Vaclav Havel, is an association of former dissidents, intellectuals
and democratic reformers.
   Havel has said that anyone who feels like a member of Civic
Forum is one and that after free elections are held there will be
no more need for the group.
   Finally, illustrating that these days anyone can form a party,
The Party of Mild Progress Within the Constraints of the Law was
revived by Jaroslav Hasek, author of ``Good Soldier Schweik''.

<HEAD>Dictator's Slush Fund Taxes International Traders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLON, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trading company owned by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's former presidential candidate was a slush fund
that siphoned millions of dollars a year from international
merchants in the free port of Colon.
   Authorities think Transit S.A., owned by Carlos Duque, was also
a conduit for the drug deals that enriched Noriega as well as many
Defense Forces henchmen.
   ``The company is suspected of trafficking in drugs and arms,''
said Colon's provincial governor, Leopoldo Benedetti.
   With Noriega's downfall, the inside story of Transit is slowly
coming to light.
   U.S. troops seized the company, raided its warehouse and sealed
the unmarked office. Like many Noriega associates, Duque is on the
run, wanted for questioning by U.S. and Panamanian authorities.
   Transit's manager, Rafael Ceballos, has turned himself in, eager
to spill his secrets and professing unbridled enthusiasm for the
U.S. forces that occupy Colon, home of the world's largest
duty-free port after Hong Kong.
   After 18 years with Transit, he says he has a lot to tell.
   ``Everything is in the books,'' he said. ``Everything. I'm no
jerk.''
   Ceballos was interviewed after surrendering to Benedetti
Thursday.
   ``He wants to talk. He wants to tell everything. He's tired of
hiding. He wants to keep on living,'' the new governor said.
   Estimates of how much money Transit collected vary.
   The new director of the Colon Free Zone, Jimmy Ford, a nephew of
new Second Vice President Guillermo Ford, estimates it at $1
million a month. Ceballos says it averaged from $3 million to $4
million annually.
   Others, like Colombian consul Alfonso Esquivel, say Transit
collected tens of millions of dollars a year.
   ``It is the only private company in the world that levies
taxes,'' Esquivel said.
   Transit charged traders 1 percent of the value of a shipment's
freight on board and an additional $1.50 for every crate on board,
Ceballos said.
   The duty-free port at the northern end of the Panama Canal
operates as a marketplace to distribute goods throughout the
hemisphere. It's particularly important to Japanese and other Asian
nations who sell in South America.
   Ceballos said Transit's funds and import-export facilities were
at the service of Noriega and a few high-ranking officers.
   ``For example, if they asked for $150,000 and the company only
had $100,000, it would have to get a bank loan for $50,000 to get
the money for them,'' he said.
   ``If they wanted to buy a refrigerator, some champagne, some
liquor, whatever, the company bought it, the company paid because
of the connection between Carlos Duque and the Defense Forces.''
   Many of the goods Transit imported were for Noriega and his
family, Ceballos said.
   He denied that Transit, which had trading concessions for
Colombian coffee, Cuban cigars and Nicaraguan rum, was involved in
the cocaine trade.
   ``No. Not for a moment,'' he said as he awaited questioning by
U.S. Army intelligence officials.
   Army Col. John Brooks, the commander of the U.S. occupation
force in Colon, said looters had emptied Transit's warehouse before
the raid Wednesday, but that at one point a drug-sniffing dog was
brought in to sniff the residue.
   ``It went crazy. It was running around in circles,'' Brooks said.
   U.S. forces surrounded the city of 12,000 as part of the
invasion but did not enter for two days, during which time it was
sacked by looters.
   Transit was created in 1972 by Noriega's predecessor, Gen. Omar
Torrijos, and given the legal right to charge ``documentation
fees.''
   He said Noriega demanded more of Transit than Torrijos had.
   ``Noriega was possessive. His daughters were always asking for
something,'' Ceballos said, recalling huge shipments from China for
the Noriega family, whose home is stuffed with delicate porcelain,
jade and ivory carvings and furniture inlaid with mother-of-pearl.
   Ceballos said all decisions were made by Duque. He said only
Duque, his son and his wife could sign company checks.
   Duque, a longtime business associate of Noriega's, ran for
president in the May 1989 election that Noriega voided after
international observers said the opposition had won in a landslide.
The opposition leader, Guillermo Endara, was installed as president
following Dec. 20 invasion.
   Transit is despised by traders in the duty-free zone. Officials
of the zone's merchants' association say it has stifled growth by
siphoning off money from the traders.

   Police raided a Vietnamese refugee camp Friday
and clashed with stone-throwing boat people who reportedly feared
they would forced to return to their Communist homeland. Officials
said 40 people were injured.
   Police fired tear gas after the Vietnamese set fire to blankets
and threw rocks to prevent a search for homemade weapons, said
government spokesman Timothy Li. Twenty-seven Vietnamese were
arrested and more than 700 weapons seized, police said.
   Television showed police equipped with helmets and shields
firing tear gas, and smoke from the fires could be seen rising
above the center on outlying Lantau island, which houses more than
3,000 Vietnamese.
   ``The boat people, in order to make the operation more
difficult, pushed their women and children to the front,'' said
Security Secretary M. Geoffrey Barnes.
   The violence came only one day after clashes broke out between
Vietnamese at another center in which one person was killed and 10
others injured.
   The government-funded radio reported the resistance may have
been prompted by reports that some of those in the center may be in
the next group of boat people forced to return to their
impoverished homeland.
   Earlier this month, the government returned 51 Vietnamese to
their homeland against their will in the first such repatriation.
   Although officials refused to say how many police joined in the
operation, the radio put the number at about 300.
   Police said Friday night that said 14 Vietnamese and 26 guards
and policemen were injured in the camp.
   The officials said five hours of counseling by staff of the U.N.
High Commissioner of Refugees and voluntary agencies failed to
persuade the Vietnamese to cooperate.
   Police reported two clashes Thursday night between Vietnamese
armed with homemade weapons at the Shek Kong Detention Center in
which one person died and 10 others were injured..
   Police said they were investigating the cause of the brawls
between two rival groups from Quang Ning. About 100 people were
involved in the fighting.
   Police have classified the case as homicide. The injured at Shek
Kong ranged in age from 16 to 28, and one was hospitalized in poor
condition, police said.
   No arrests were made at Shek Kong but police found homemade
weapons such as swords and lances in the detention center after the
battles.
   According to police, five people have died this year in
factional fighting that erupts frequently in the crowded and
squalid Vietnamese camps.
   ``This latest violence is a further manifestation of the unrest
in the camps caused by the threat of forced deportation,'' said
George Foulkes, of Britain's opposition Labor Party. ``I fear that
it is a foretaste of worse to come unless the government abandons
its policy.''
   Foulkes also accused the British government of delaying
deportations at the request of the U.S. government.
   ``While they are dithering and delaying, the situation in the
camps is reaching boiling point,'' he said.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who requested anonymity, said in
response: ``The facts are that considerable assistance is being
given through our reintegration package to the boat people ... We
are not waiting for Washington.''
   About 44,000 boat people who have sailed into Hong Kong since
mid-June 1988 and are considered illegal immigrants unless they can
prove they fled persecution.
   Those who are denied refugee status and have their appeals
rejected can volunteer to go home or face forced repatriation.
   The 12,000 boat people in Hong Kong who arrived before the
screening program took effect were automatically granted refugee
status and are awaiting resettlement overseas.
   Meanwhile, the eighth batch of boat people to volunteer to
return to their Communist homeland flew back to Hanoi Friday.
   The 111 people who took the chartered flight bring to 874 the
number of boat people who have returned home voluntarily since
March.

<HEAD>Texas Investigators Probe Suspicious Fire, Neo-Nazi Graffiti at Black
Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RED OAK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neo-Nazi graffiti has been found at a
small black church that was heavily damaged by a suspicious fire
Christmas Eve, and authorities said they were investigating.
   The fire at the Cedar Grove Missionary Baptist Church in this
Dallas suburb started outside and appeared to have been set, said
Jeff Bryant, one of four Ellis County Sheriff's Department
investigators probing the fire.
   The blaze burned about a fourth of the church's pews and did
about $15,000 in damage, Bryant said.
   The Rev. S.E. Shead, the church's pastor, said members of the
congregation found five swastikas painted on church property while
surveying the damage Tuesday. Shead said he believed the fire was
racially motivated.
   The swastikas were painted on the church's front steps, a
portable sign in front and a propane tank near the spot where the
fire began, he said. They were not there when church members left
Sunday afternoon following Christmas Eve services.
   Authorities are trying to determine whether the fire and
graffiti are connected, Bryant said.
   The investigator said the symbols are not correct depictions of
the Nazi swastika.
   ``They are not the pattern of an educated neo-Nazi,'' he said.
   Information gathered by the sheriff's department will be turned
over to the state fire marshal's office, Bryant said.
   About 30 people attend the church in Red Oak, a sparsely
populated area near Waxahachie, which is about 40 miles south of
Dallas.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department acknowledged Friday it
was in such a rush to indict Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on drug
charges that it may not have followed its own rules for making sure
state secrets would not be disclosed in court.
   However, said department spokesman David Runkel, ``We believe
there is a strong case against General Noreiga and that case can be
successfully brought to trial.''
   Some legal experts have said there could be problems in trying
Noriega because he would seek to use classified information
stemming from his past cooperation with the Central Intelligence
Agency.
   Runkel said on Tuesday that such concerns ``have been grossly
exaggerated.''
   At a press briefing on Friday, he told reporters that the
department may not have followed its usual policy of reviewing, in
drawing up an indictment, any classified documents that might be
used in a trial.
   ``I had been informed that that was the policy that had in fact
been followed in this case,'' he told reporters.
   ``It now appears that there was some rush to draw up the Noriega
indictment and those guidelines may not have been completely
followed,'' he said.
   Runkel declined to elaborate on the nature of the ``rush'' and
said, ``I haven't determined the reason'' for it.
   He said the department's decision to review the national
security issues was an outgrowth of a Dec. 14 meeting of
prosecutors in the case with representatives of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and CIA.
   That meeting was called to discuss drug indictments against
Noriega in Miami and Tampa, Fla., and a decision was made to
proceed with the Miami case, Runkel said.
   Noriega reportedly worked closely with the CIA and the Pentagon
while he served as the head of Panama's military intelligence
service and after he became commander in chief in 1983.

   The body of a French citizen killed when a
relief plane was shot down in southern Sudan suddenly exploded in
Khartoum just before it was to be flown back to Paris for funeral
services, sources said Friday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
medical personnel at the scene did not believe the Thursday blast
was caused by a buildup of natural gases and feared the corpse had
been booby-trapped.
   If the body indeed was sabotaged, it was unclear if it was meant
to explode on the UNICEF flight that carried the corpse back from
southern Sudan to Khartoum, or on the flight to Paris, the sources
said.
   ``It was not an accident, but we don't know whether it was the
responsibility of an organized movement or an individual,'' Dr.
Rony Brauman, president of the aid group Doctors Without Borders,
said in Paris.
   Bernard Kouchner, the French secretary for humanitarian affairs,
said France would urge Sudan to investigate the bombing and the
downing of the plane.
   The dead person was one of four relief workers killed in the
attack over southern Sudan. Three were French nationals working for
the aid group Doctors Without Borders and one was a Sudanese
employee of the World Food Program.
   The identity of the person whose body exploded was not known,
but the sources said it belonged to one of the French nationals.
The sources said the bodies that were bound for Paris were flown
there on Friday.
   The four were killed when their twin-engine Britten-Norman
Islander was shot down near Aweil on Dec. 21.
   The explosion was described as relatively small, but big enough
to knock a passenger from the truck that was carrying the bodies to
the France-bound flight and to cause a fire that burned the driver,
the sources said.
   The blast occurred on the tarmac of the Khartoum airport as the
bodies were being taken to the plane.
   ``Our people in one of the trucks heard a small explosion and
then the body just started to burn,'' Brauman said. ``It burned the
whole truck. One of our local employees broke his arm when he fell
on the tarmac to get away.''
   Brauman refused to specify which body had burned, but said
toxicologists would test clothing and the body bag for traces of
explosives. He made their comments before a closed-casket service
Friday for the three French nationals at his organization's
headquarters.
   The relief group identified the victims as Yvon Feliot, a pilot
for the group; Laurent Fernet, a supply specialist; and Dr.
Jean-Paul Bescond. The Sudanese was Frazer Ariyaba.
   Doctors Without Borders operates a hospital at Aweil, a
government garrison town about 590 miles southwest of Khartoum that
is said to be surrounded by Sudan People's Liberation Army rebels.
   Sudan's government has accused the rebels of downing the plane
with a missile. But the rebels said the Sudanese army shot down the
plane to ``justify its continuing ban on relief activities in
southern Sudan.''
   The government two months ago banned relief flights into
southern Sudan. It later accused the UNICEF relief effort of using
relief flights to ferry arms and ammunition to the rebels. The
United Nations has denied the accusation.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan since April has been moving relief food
and supplies into southern Sudan to avert a famine it said
threatened up to 250,000 people with starvation. U.N. officials say
they succeeded in staving off the famine for this year, but fear
the situation could deteriorate next year if the ban is not lifted.
   The rebels have been fighting Sudan's Moslem-dominated
government since 1983 seeking greater autonomy for the country's
predominantly Christian and African south.

<HEAD>Former Prime Minister Nu Barred from Elections</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: One name correct for Nu</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling military junta has barred
Burma's last democratically elected prime minister from running in
the May general elections, the government said Friday.
   Kyaw Sann, spokesman for the military rulers, said former Prime
Minister Nu was disqualified for his refusal to dissolve a parallel
government he declared at the height of last year's national
uprising for democracy.
   The spokesman told a weekly official news briefing that Nu also
would face legal action, but that he would not be imprisoned.
   Nu announced his 26-member government Sept. 9, 1988, saying he
was still the country's rightful prime minister because the 1962
military coup that ousted him was illegal.
   Gen. Saw Maung's State Law and Order Restoration Council seized
power and brutally crushed protests nine days after Nu declared his
government. Saw Maung declared the rival Cabinet illegal and
demanded its dissolution as a condition for Nu to run in the
election scheduled for May 27.
   The election will be the first multiparty balloting in Burma
since Nu was elected in 1960.
   But diplomats say the military junta has arrested and harassed
thousands of dissidents since it seized power, raising doubts the
election will be free and fair.
   At a Christmas Day news conference, the 82-year-old Nu rejected
the government demand, saying he was ``prepared to face any
consequences.''
   In a Dec. 7 letter to Saw Maung, Nu said he would disband his
government only when Ne Win, the general who ousted him, made a
public apology.
   Kyaw Sann said members of Nu's party who were part of his
government and refused to disown it also were barred from the
elections. But those who withdrew from the parallel government
would be allowed to run, even if they remained members of Nu's
League for Democracy and Peace, he said.
   In reply to a reporter's question, Kyaw Sann said Aung San Suu
Kyi, considered the most popular opposition figure, would be
allowed to run providing she did not violate any provisions of the
election law.
   Ms. Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since July 20, accused
of trying to divide the people from the army. A week ago, Gen. Tin
Oo, chairman of her National League for Democracy party, was
sentenced to three years in prison on the same charge.

   A Canada goose stuck in an icy pond was
free by the time rescuers began crawling across the pond's frozen
surface, but the rescuers grabbed the goose anyway and took it to a
veterinarian for treatment.
   The goose, which had spent the past few days with its feet
frozen into four-inch ice at Crowders Mountain State Park, freed
itself Thursday when the ice began to thaw, said Wayne Smith,
director of the Gaston County Animal Control Department.
   Nonetheless, an animal control officer, wrapped in a rubber life
raft and tied to a rope on shore, slid out and nabbed the goose,
which appeared to have a broken leg. It was taken to Forestbrook
Animal Hospital for examination.
   The leg wasn't broken, but the bird was suffering from
borderline frostbite, an unusual ailment for an animal used to
living in cold climates, said veterinarian Dr. Mark Epstein.
   Vets treated the bird with anti-inflammatory medicine. It was
eating well and appeared healthy, Epstein said, but it wasn't clear
whether the bird would be set free.

<TEXT>
   Many Romanians who have thrown off the
yoke of their dictator want to make a clean break with the past,
but the new leadership says the country can't afford to purge
former Communist Party members.
   In Romania, virtually everyone in a leading position was
required to be a party member. And party membership, government
officials say, is not a mark of ideology.
   ``Many Communist Party members are indespensible,'' said Cazimir
Ionescu, one of the vice presidents of the provisional government.
   ``We have not followed the old system of looking at dossiers,''
Ionescu said at a news conference.
   The Communist Party has become a hated reminder in Romania of
the 24 years of Nicolae Ceausscu, who was overthrown, captured and
executed in a bloody revolution that came so swiftly the country
has had no time to plan its future.
   ``Jos Comunismul'' _ ``Down with Communism'' _ is a slogan that
now appears on posters and scrawled on walls around the captial.
   Romanians in the street say they want to wipe the words
Communist Party from their mind and language.
   ``Communism is shame and it should be destroyed everywhere,''
said Gheorghe Chelaru, who described himself only as a worker.
   But members of the provisional government say they are trying to
run a country and an economy. They need managers and organizers
with a proven record. In Romania, all those people once belonged to
the party.
   The new government is trying to take people on the basis of
merit, not their past, said Ionescu.
   Prominent ex-Communists in the new leadership include President
Ion Iliescu, former Ambassador to the United States Silviu Brucan,
and former Foreign Minister Corneliu Manescu.
   Dumitru Mazilu, another leading figure, was a diplomat who was
under house arrest for most of the last two years because he
refused to doctor a report for the U.N. Human Rights Commission in
Geneva.
   Even the poet Mircea Dinescu, one of the country's leading
dissidents, was a member of the party, until last spring.
   ``The party doesn't exist anymore. Where do you see the party?
How can it contribute to the revolution? We don't know. We didn't
ask those who came to the palace (to join the revolution), Are you
Communists?'' said deputy Foreign Minister Corneliu Bogdan. ``I
myself was a member of the party.''
   ``If we begin to count by number, then I think you are missing
the point,'' he told journalists who repeatedly asked how many
former Communists are in the new leadership.
   Bogdan and Ionescu said the new government was committed to
ending the abuses of Ceausescu. They pointed out that the
government moved quickly to repeal some of the most hated laws.
   Romanians are free to travel, ration cards have been eliminated
and food once destined for export has been redirected to the shops.
   Ionescu and Bogdan say they are committed to democracy, to
opening a free market and to holding free elections by April.
   The government officials say if the people don't like the former
Communists, they can vote them out.

   Federal marshals arrested the Rev. Daniel
Berrigan on Friday for boycotting his arraignment in New Orleans on
charges stemming from a Dec. 1 demonstration at the federal
building there.
   The longtime anti-war protester, charged with blocking the
building's lobby, wrote Magistrate Alma Chasez in New Orleans on
Dec. 11 to say he would not return for his court appearance because
he believed his prosecution was ``wildly excessive.''
   The court clerk issued a warrant for his arrest for failing to
appear and marshals picked him up early Friday morning at his
Manhattan home.
   Federal Magistrate Nina Gershon in Manhattan scheduled a hearing
for Jan. 12 on Berrigan's removal to New Orleans and released him
on a $5,000 personal recognizance bond.
   Berrigan, 68, himself a Jesuit priest, said in his letter to
Chasez that he would contribute the equivalent of New York-New
Orleans round-trip air fare to a Salvadoran relief fund.

   About 20,000 workers in a mining and
industrial complex walked off their jobs Friday, demanding a 40
percent pay increase, Belgrade Radio reported.
   If the strike continues at the Kolubara complex 35 miles south
of Belgrade, the operation of two plants essential for supplying
power to the Yugoslav capital would be threatened, the state news
agency Tanjug said.
   It was among several strikes throughout the country this month,
with workers protesting low wages amid a 2,500 percent annual
inflation rate and claiming they would be unable to cope with the
government austerity measures set to take effect Monday.
   About 200 coal miners in Ivangrad also went on strike for higher
wages and to protest the wage and price freeze announced by Premier
Ante Markovic's government.
   The government is embarking on a market-oriented economic reform
plan in which it has promised to shut down unprofitable enterprises.
   Other strikes involving several thousand workers were reported
earlier this week in cities of Mostar and Kragujevac.
   In Belgrade, several thousand strikers in engineering plants
obtained 50 percent raises Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The group which has claimed responsibility for
the mail bomb deaths of a federal judge and an attorney expressed
ire over court rulings in school desegregation cases, an area in
which both victims were involved.
   The letter claiming responsibility for the violence also decried
the legal system's handling of crimes by blacks against whites,
particularly mentioning last year's slaying of Julie Love in
Atlanta, a case never touched by the two men killed in the
mid-December bombings.
   The letter, from a group calling itself Americans for a
Competent Federal Judicial System, said 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance and Savannah attorney Robert Robinson
were ``assassinated ... in reprisal for the atrocities inflicted
upon Julie Love.''
   The letter, which was sent to WAGA-TV in Atlanta and disclosed
Thursday, said the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals must be shown
that ``protecting the innocent warrants a higher court priority
than granting the blacks' demand for white teachers for their
children.''
   The letter did not refer to specific cases.
   However, Vance was on the 11th Circuit panel that directed
suburban Atlanta's DeKalb County school system this year to
transfer about 120 veteran teachers from majority white schools to
predominantly black ones in a long-running desegregation case there.
   A school desegregation case in Savannah also was before the 11th
Circuit this year. Vance did not sit on the panel that heard the
Savannah case, but Robinson had represented the NAACP in that suit.
   The letter threatened that ``two more prominent members of the
NAACP shall be assassinated, using more sophisticated means'' as
part of the reprisal for Ms. Love's death.
   A federal judge, an attorney and an NAACP officer will be
killed, the letter added, ```anytime a black man rapes a white
woman in Alabama, Florida or Georgia in the future.'' The
Atlanta-based 11th Circuit hears federal appeals from those three
states.
   Ms. Love, a white preschool fitness teacher, disappeared July
11, 1988, and her body was found last August. The search for her
was highly publicized in the area, with ``Have You Seen Julie
Love'' posters ubiquitous.
   Following the discovery of her body this year, two black men
were arrested, one of whom has pleaded guilty to murder, rape,
kidnapping and armed robbery. The other man is awaiting trial for
murder.
   The DeKalb County school case dates back to 1969, when the
system was first placed under a federal court order to desegregate.
The 11th Circuit last year overturned a district judge's ruling
that by 1988 DeKalb County had done its best to integrate the
73,000-student system.
   The appeals court's subsequent ruling that DeKalb must take
further steps toward integration recently went before the Supreme
Court, where the justices this month refused to intervene.
   In Savannah, a lengthy school desegregation case was decided in
October when the 11th Circuit ruled that a ``magnet school'' plan
offered by the school system was appropriate for integration. The
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which
had argued that the plan still left many black students in
segregated schools, has not yet said whether it will appeal.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the first day of the new year, new rules
will raise the amount of money recipients of government disability
benefits can earn, the Department of Health and Human Services
announced Friday.
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said the increases ``will serve as
an additional incentive for many disabled Americans to return to
work and improve the quality of life for themselves and their
families.''
   The rules will affect recipients of Supplemental Security Income
program and the Social Security Disability Insurance program who
are not blind.
   Under the disability insurance program, recipients are allowed
to earn up to a certain amount and still receive benefits. On Jan.
1, that allowed earnings levels will increase for the first time in
more than a decade.
   The new rules will change the trigger for the ``trial work
period'' during which a disability insurance recipient continues to
receive benefits for nine months after returning to work. Since
January 1979, a recipient has entered a ``trial work period'' when
he earns more than $75 per month or works more than 15 hours per
week. That will increase to $200 or 40 hours.
   Also under the disability insurance program, when the
recipient's earnings reach the ``substantial gainful activity''
level, which has been set at $300 per month since January 1980,
benefits can continue only under certain conditions. That trigger
will rise to $500.
   The ``substantial gainful activity'' gauge is also used to
determine eligibility in the Supplemental Security Income program
as well as in the disability insurance program.
   The allowed earnings level for blind recipients of disability
insurance is set by another regulation, and is now $740 per month.
That will rise to $780 on Jan. 1, a Social Security spokesman said.
   The disability insurance program pays about $1.7 billion each
month to 2.8 million workers and 1.2 million dependent spouses and
children of disabled workers. About 3 million blind and disabled
workers receive SSI benefits.

<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel, the defiant
playwright who rode a gentle revolt from a prison cell to the halls
of Parliament, assumed the presidency Friday in an emotional climax
to an electrifying year.
   The masses who chanted ``Havel to the castle!'' during the angry
rallies of November thrilled to the sight of the dissident actually
in Hradcany Castle, taking the oath beneath the nation's red, white
and blue flag. Cannons boomed and a military band played the
national anthem.
   ``I promise I won't betray your trust. I will take the country
to free elections and that's a task for us all,'' the 53-year-old
president told the adoring crowds from the balcony of the towering
medieval castle.
   Havel, whose plays and essays in defense of civil liberty earned
him jail terms totaling five years, languished in a cell eight
months ago. On Friday, a special session of Parliament elected him
Czechoslovakia's ninth president.
   The election by 323 deputies, most of whom are Communists, was a
historic victory for the pro-democracy movement that in 41 days has
broken the party's stranglehold on power.
   Among his first acts of office, Havel named as chief of staff
Josef Lzicar, the attorney who defended him and other prominent
dissidents.
   Havel also is planning an amnesty program, the details of which
are to be announced New Year's Day, the state news agency CTK
reported.
   Havel's election is part of a sweeping series of accords between
the opposition and the Communists that are to lead to free
elections next year.
   It came one day after Alexander Dubcek, the ousted Communist
Party chief who led the ``Prague Spring'' reforms that were crushed
in 1968, was named head of Parliament in another stunning rebuke to
the repression of the past.
   It also comes two days after the Bulgarian government agreed to
talks with the opposition, seven days after the government was
overthrown in Romania, seven weeks after the Berlin Wall was opened
by East Germany, five months after a Solidarity activist became
prime minister of Poland, seven months after Hungary opened its
borders to the West, and eight months after the Soviet Union held
its first competitive elections in 70 years.
   During his somber inauguration, Communist Prime Minister Marian
Calfa praised him as ``a man who is faithful to his beliefs despite
persecution.''
   ``He never accepted offers from his friends or recommendations
by his enemies to emigrate where the conditions of his life would
have been more comfortable,'' Calfa said in a nominating speech.
   Havel walked the aisle with Dubcek as Communist deputies
applauded decorously, camera bulbs flashed and the band played a
stirring fanfare.
   The playwright signed the oath of office, which was amended just
Thursday to delete a pledge of allegiance to socialism.
   Tears filled the eyes of a few opposition members and old
friends of Havel who watched the 20-minute ceremony from the back
of the hall.
   Twenty cannon salvos fired from the castle on the Plain of Letna
boomed over central Prague below.
   Havel, whose plays have been banned in Czechoslovakia since
1968, agreed to take the presidency for six months leading to free
elections in mid-1990.
   ``This must happen in a decent and peaceful way so that the
clean face of our revolution is not sullied. It is a task for us
all,'' he told the crowd from the castle balcony after taking the
oath of office.
   ``Long live Havel!'' they chanted as he and, Olga, his wife of
30 years, left the balcony to walk across the courtyard to St.
Vitus Cathedral for a special Mass of thanksgiving.
   Then, Havel became the first president since the Communists took
power in 1948 to attend the Roman Catholic Mass, traditionally part
of the inaugural ceremony.
   Havel's appearance at the nationally televised Mass was
significant for the country's 9 million Catholics, who suffered
repression for their faith under the Communists.
   After the brief Mass, the towering vaults of the cathedral
filled with the voices of the Prague Philharmonic Choir singing
Dvorak's ``Te Deum.''
   After dark, Havel briefly joined several thousand people waiting
in the cold on Prague's Old Town Square. The blonde, mustachioed
president wore a dark blue overcoat, blue suit and striped tie
rather than his usual cardigan and corduroy slacks.
   He made no speech, but smiled and waved from the castle balcony
to those below on the baroque square.
   Strangers grabbed each other and danced, while others broke out
in spontaneous song. Folk groups played and danced on the stage and
in small groups around a giant Christmas tree. Among the Czech
flags waving on the square was one with 12 gold stars on a blue
field of the European Community.
   Czechoslovakia's president traditionally has little real power
but people are looking to Havel to restore stability and inspire
confidence in Western investors.
   President Bush was among foreign leaders sending congratulations
to Havel. He pledged U.S. support for democracy in Czechoslovakia
and the White House said his election ``marks a fitting end to a
year of astonishing change in Eastern Europe.''
   In Warsaw, Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa welcomed ``with
great joy'' Havel's election and wished him strength in his new
responsibilities.
   Immediately after Havel's election, students declared an end to
their strike that began in mid-November.
   It was the students who sparked the revolution when their
peaceful march on Nov. 17 was brutally crushed by police. The
violence prompted mass protests, forcing the Communists to
negotiate their own demise over the next several weeks with the
democratic opposition group Civic Forum, led by Havel.
   Talks that lasted until Dec. 23 between Communists, opposition
leaders and other political forces led to the creation of a new
reform government that included several former dissidents.
Hard-line President Gustav Husak, who took over after the Soviet
invasion, quit Dec. 10.
   Havel's first foreign visit, announced Friday, will be to East
and West Germany on Jan. 2, the state news agency reported.

   The indictment of 18 people by a federal grand
jury has broken up a ``worldwide conspiracy'' that made and
marketed millions of counterfeit name-brand athletic shoes, a
federal prosecutor said Friday.
   Federal agents executed arrest and seizure warrants ``throughout
the country'' on Thursday and Friday, winding up a 4{-month
investigation directed by agents from the U.S. Customs Service
office in Nogales, Ariz., said U.S. Attorney Stephen McNamee.
   The 18 defendants are charged with violating U.S. trademark laws
and money-laundering, McNamee said.
   McNamee said federal agents have seized $4.5 million in cash and
other assets from defendants in the case.
   He said authorities in Chile and Mexico also made arrests in the
case.
   McNamee was uncertain whether any or all of the defendants
arrested in other countries would be extradited to the United
States, but said both Mexico and Chile had been cooperating in the
investigation and that cooperation was being sought from other
governments as well.
   The indictment, returned Wednesday in Tucson and unsealed
Friday, alleges that South Korean businessman Dae Yun Hwang is the
head of the operation. Three other South Koreans also were
indicted, McNamee said.
   At least seven of the defendants had been arrested by mid-day
Friday, McNamee said. He did not say which seven were in custody
and did not know if any of the Koreans had been arrested.
   McNamee said the counterfit shoes were made in Hwang's South
Korean factories and smuggled into the United States and other
countries, where they were marketed with such brand-name labels as
Reeboks, Vans, Converse, Avia, Tiger, Puma, Adidas, L.A. Gear,
Nike, Pony and Jordache.
   The shoes were sold through major retail organizations, he said.
   He said the investigation began Aug. 4 when Mexican customs
refused to allow 40 cartons of shoes to cross the border from
Nogales.
   U.S. Customs agents examined the shipment and found that it
contained counterfeit shoes bearing a number of brand-name lables.
The shipment was seized and a nationwide investigation was launched.
   Harley Lewin, a New York lawyer representing Converse, Reebok
and Van Doren Rubber Co., maker of Vans, said his clients have
filed two civil actions in federal court in San Diego seeking a
total of $12 million in damages.
   ``We think that over a period of two years, in excess of two
million pairs of shoes were counterfeited,'' he said.
   All of those named in the two lawsuits were among those listed
in the federal indictment, Lewin said.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called the indictment and
arrests ``a notable victory against international consumer fraud,
money laundering and smuggling.''
   ``Criminal activity is increasingly international in scope, and
we are responding in kind with law-enforcement activities on a
world-wide basis,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.
   In addition to Hwang, McNamee identified those named in the
indictment as B.S. Kim, M.K. Kim and H.S. Tae, all of South Korea;
San Diego residents Byron McLaughlin, Debbie Watson, Celeste Cota,
Nathan Betech, Marcos Betech, Abraham Betech, Isaac Paz and
Herminia Ascensio; Glenn McLaughlin of Iquique, Chile; Roman Trenka
of San Juan, Puerto Rico; Dudley W. Miller III of Boston; Sol
Weisenberg of Cincinnati; Natalie Ann Quaratino of Mexico City; and
Jorge Fitch Lazaro of Guaymas, Mexico.

   The papal envoy in Panama who has had Manuel
Antonio Noriega as a house guest since Sunday was out of the
country when the U.S. invasion occurred and was flown back to
Panama aboard a special U.S. military flight, American officials
said Friday.
   Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, who has been a key figure in
the talks over Noriega's fate, was in Spain at the time of the
invasion and set out for Panama shortly thereafter.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Laboa was
unable to get back to Panama because flights were canceled during
the first few days after the invasion.
   The officials said Laboa felt it was important for him to be in
Panama during the critical post-invasion period because of the
influence he wields as Pope John Paul II's emissary.
   According to the officials, the U.S. military resolved Laboa's
problem by arranging a flight to Panama for him. Noriega turned up
at the envoy's residence four days after the invasion.

   The Navy is proposing to put two of its four
battleships in mothballs and limit purchases of the $1.2 billion
Trident submarine to every other year, a senior Pentagon official
says.
   But the service, studying proposals for the new fiscal-year
budget, is fighting to spare at least 14 aircraft carriers from
White House pressures to trim the military's most favored weapons
programs.
   President Bush, who is slated to deliver his budget to Congress
on Jan. 22, may be called upon to make the final decisions on any
suggested cuts, given their controversial nature.
   ``We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' the Pentagon official said
of the current budget-juggling exercise. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The fiscal 1991 spending plan will be a key barometer of the
Pentagon's ability to respond to pressures from budget cutters on
Capitol Hill and in the Office of Management and Budget.
   White House budget planners have told Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney he can spend a little more than $292 billion in the new
budget year, which begins next Oct. 1. That means Pentagon spending
won't keep pace with inflation, which the administration has
projected will increase at an average rate of 4.1 percent.
   The Navy, like other services, is being forced to trim programs
it holds to be successful _ such as the Trident _ in order to meet
these goals, said the senior official.
   The official said the service is ``seriously considering''
stretching out the annual purchases of the strategic Trident subs
to every other year.
   The sub's billion-dollar price tag has made it easy prey for
lawmakers advocating less lavish spending on strategic nuclear
weapons programs amid the warming of relations with the Soviet
Union.
   In November, the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics
Corp. in Groton, Conn., won a contract to build the 17th Trident
submarine.
   But due to its high cost and complexity, funds for the submarine
are stretched out over several years.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III has told Rep. John G.
Rowland, R-Conn., that he expects to request full funding for the
18th Trident submarine in the fiscal 1991 budget.
   But the letter made no mention about long-term procurement funds
for additional submarines.
   ``I'd put my money on some type of stretch-out,'' said another
Defense Department official, asked about the future of the Trident
program.
   The official said it was ``premature'' to talk about an end to
the program, and said that if an every-other-year purchase policy
is finally adopted, ``it may not even compromise the long-term
number'' of submarines, widely exepted to be 24.
   The service's World War II-era battleships also have become
targets of budget cutters on Capitol Hill, particularly in the
aftermath of last spring's explosion aboard the USS Iowa, which
claimed 47 sailors' lives. The tragedy spawned a series of
congressional hearings, where lawmakers voiced sharp criticism of
the huge ship's safety procedures and personnel practices.
   Even the chief of naval operations, Adm. Carlisle A. Trost,
admitted at one hearing that the future of the four warships was
``up for grabs'' in the budget debate. But the Navy leadership is
loathe to let the warships go, the senior official said.
   ``Nobody _ not the Army, not the Marine Corps, not the Navy,
wants to give those ships up,'' the official contended, arguing
that their mobile firepower offers a major boost when a president
calls for a little ``gunship diplomacy.''
   ``The '91 (budget) plan calls for putting two in mothballs. But
we'd still have two and we want to hang on to those,'' he said.
   He did not identify which battleships would be retired.
   The official argued against putting all four 58,000-ton vessels
in mothballs again, citing the high costs and problems that arose
during their remodernization in the early 1980s.
   The Navy was forced to ``call up old, retired sailors'' to help
in the rebuilding of the ships, the official said.
   ``When it came to taking the propellers off the darn things,
there was only one retired chief petty officer who knew how to do
it _ and you had to use special explosive charges to do it,'' the
official said.
   The second DOD official noted that congressional pressure may
work against mothballing the battleships, since their home ports
were to be dispersed among four states under a revised program.
   ``Our phones rang off the hook'' from lawmakers unhappy about
Trost's suggestion of the ships' possible demise, the official said.
   The senior official said that the Navy is fighting to save at
least 14 aircraft carriers during the next fiscal year.
   One carrier _ the World War II-era Midway _ is scheduled for
retirement next year, which would bring the fleet from 15 to 14.
   ``Tell me, which commitment are we supposed to walk away from?''
the official asked, pointing out that the U.S. commitment to sail
the Indian Ocean and keep tabs on the potentially explosive Persian
Gulf haven't changed.
   The official also said the requirements of the Navy most
probably will increase as the service is asked to place more power
on the high seas to advance the nation's war against illicit
narcotics traffickers.

<TEXT>
   Parliament voted to change the country's
official name Friday and to eliminate the constitutional provision
guaranteeing the Communist Party's leading role in the goverment.
   The constitutional changes were adopted 374-1 with 11
abstentions. The majority of the lawmakers immediately rose and
began to sing the national anthem.
   The move changes the nation's Communist-imposed name, the
People's Republic of Poland, to the pre-World War II Republic of
Poland.
   The amendments incorporate into the constitution the reforms won
by the Solidarity-led opposition movement, which won partially free
elections in June and assumed dominance of the government in August.
   Soviet-backed Polish communists changed the country's name to
the People's Republic of Poland when they proclaimed a new
government on July 22, 1944, while the country was still ravaged by
war.
   Both Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, head of the Solidarity-dominated government,
were present for the evening debate on the constitutional
amendments.
   The amendments eliminated the phrase that mandated the leading
role of the Communist Party in state affairs and changed a phrase
that called Poland a ``socialist society'' to a ``citizens'
society.''
   The pre-war crown that graced the head of the eagle on the
national emblem also was restored. The crown symbolizes Polish
sovereignty and unity.
   The amendments also introduced a provision giving citizens the
right to create political parties and other organizations. Until
now, the Communist Party, the Democratic Party and the Peasant
Party were officially the only legally recognized parties in Poland.
   Also introduced was a clause guaranteeing protection of private
property.
   The amendments were adopted following a daylong debate, with
lawmakers often haggling over one or two words.
   Earlier, Cardinal Jozef Glemp wished lawmakers strength Friday
for the hard tasks ahead. It was the first visit by a Polish
primate to Parliament in the country's Communist history.
   Glemp met with senators and members of all political
orientations in the Sejm, as the lower house of Parliament is
called, during a midday break in debate over amendments to the
constitution and a possible change in the country's national emblem.
   The lawmakers sang traditional Polish Christmas carols as Glemp
entered the building. ``I address all gathered here with great
respect and I would like to express my frank, patriotic and hearty
wishes,'' Glemp told the lawmakers.
   ``I wish you enough strength for the coming year and that the
link between the nation and the parliament will become stronger and
meet with greater understanding. Please accept those best wishes
from the church of which I am an abject servant,'' he said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa used a series of strikes to force
the Communists to the bargaining table this year, winning
guarantees for a role in the government in exchange for cooperation
on Poland's economic problems.
   But popular support for Solidarity among the masses and
repudiation of the Communists forced them to ultimately grant the
opposition a dominant role in the government. Reform movements
subsequently swept the rest of the East bloc, toppling the old
guard Communist governments in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Bulgaria and Romania.

   Hermann Julius Oberth, a pioneer
of the space age who worked with Werhner von Braun to help develop
Germany's V-2 rocket, died Friday. He was 95.
   Oberth died at a hospital in Nuremberg after a short illness,
according to a statement from the Hermann Oberth Museum in nearby
Feucht.
   He began experiments on a conical jet motor for the German
government in 1930 and developed a model later that year. He worked
on the motor with von Braun, considered the leading scientist in
U.S. space flight development.
   Oberth joined Braun in rocket experiments in the United States
in 1955, but he retired three years later and returned to live in
West Germany. Braun died in 1977.
   Oberth was born near Nuremberg on June 25, 1894. At age 15, he
built a small model of a rocket motor described in Jules Verne's
science fiction book ``From the Earth to the Moon.''
   After high school and World War I service in the German
infantry, Oberth studied medicine, aerodynamics and physics at
universities in Munich, Goettingen and Heidelberg.
   He submitted a thesis on rocket experiments for his doctorate,
which was turned down as too cursory. An expanded version was
published in 1923 as the book, ``The Rockets to the Planets in
Space.''
   A third publication of the work in 1929, ``The Way to Spaceship
Travel,'' is today seen as a pioneering work in rocket research.
   The same year, Oberth lost the sight in his left eye in an
experiment while working as an adviser to German director Fritz
Lang on his film, ``Woman on the Moon.''
   There were no immediate details about survivors or funeral
arrangements.

   Police fired tear gas, pulled demonstrators by
their hair and struck them with night sticks to break up a peace
march in Jerusalem on Friday by more than 3,000 Israeli,
Palestinian and European women.
   The hour-long procession from Jewish west Jerusalem to Arab east
Jerusalem was without incident until the end, when an outlawed
Palestinian flag was raised and police moved in to disperse the
marchers.
   Police said that 16 people were detained, and reporters saw
police drag several women away by their hair or clothes. Some were
struck with night sticks, and several were kicked.
   The women's march was part of a program organized by peace
actisits that is to culminate Saturday with 1,200 visiting
Europeans expected to link hands with Israelis and Palestinians in
a ``human chain'' around Jerusalem's Old City.
   The ``1990 _ Time for Peace'' demonstration Saturday is intended
to symbolize the unity of peace activists who endorse a negotiated
Middle East peace settlement.
   Meanwhile, the army said Friday that soldiers accidentally shot
two 12-year-old Palestinian boys during an assault on masked Arabs
a day earlier in the occupied Gaza Strip. Both were reported in
good condition at a Gaza hospital.
   Arab reports said the boys were on their way to the local
wholesale market on a donkey cart in predawn darkness when they
were shot.
   The army spokesman's office initially said that all four
Palestinians wounded in the incident were masked troublemakers, but
on Friday an army statement said that ``apparently children were
near the group of masked people and therefore injured by gunfire.''
   Also Friday, a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with
Israel was hacked to death by masked Arabs in Gaza's Khan Yunis
refugee camp, Arab reports said. He was identified as Ahmad
Mohammed Abu Shahmeh, 56.
   His death raised to 164 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the two-year Palestinian uprising. Most were
suspected of collaboration.
   A total of 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
uprising, and 43 Israelis also have died.
   The peace march in Jerusalem began quietly, with streams of
European, Israeli and Palestinian women meeting near Jerusalem's
Old City and marching toward east Jerusalem.
   An Israeli participant in the march, school principal Alice
Shalvi, said she hoped that the demonstration would influence
politicians.
   ``It reassures us that there is someone to talk to,'' she said.
``The fact that there are Jewish women and Arab women here proves
the point that it can be done.''
   The marchers sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and shouted peace
slogans en route to their destination, the Hakawati Theater.
   As the first of the marchers reached the theater's courtyard,
someone raised a Palestinian flag and police moved in to remove it.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said the police met with resistance
and used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd. He said no one
was seriously injured.
   Women screamed and fought with police officers as some of their
group were detained and dragged off to a police van.
   Dacia Valent, an Italian who is a member of the European
Parliament, was taken into custody when she argued with police
against making arrests. She later was released.
   Police said the others detained included three more Italians,
one French citizen, four Palestinian-Americans, one Israeli and six
Palestinians. All foreigners were later released.
   After the melee, trampled peace signs littered the courtyard.
   Friday's program began with European women joining an Israeli
protest group, Women in Black, at their weekly silent vigil
protesting continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   About two dozen Israeli men and women heckled the peace
demonstrators, but others showed support by distributing flowers,
candy and cakes.
   ``I would like us to be really a peace presence,'' said Cristina
Savio, 36, a publishing house employee from Torino, Italy. ``Of
course, it's easier for us ... because we're going away after a
week, but it's a way of saying we are there.''

<HEAD>Gov't Will Allow Turks to Take Back Moslem Names</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The government will allow Bulgaria's
Turkish minority to take back Moslem names they were forced to
abandon during an anti-Turk campaign that began in the early 1980s,
an official said Friday.
   Word of the policy change came at the end of a one-day meeting
of the Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee. It was
confirmed by Politburo member Alexander Lilov at a news conference.
   ``We adopted (today) a policy based on guaranteeing all freedoms
starting with the free choice of names, religion and schools
without any restrictions,'' Lilov said.
   The name change campaign, which gathered momentum in 1984,
affected hundreds of thousands of people, including Pomaks, or
Moslem Slavs, living in southern Bulgaria.
   The forced change and increasing curbs on ethnic and religious
rights of the 1.5-million-strong Turkish minority earlier this year
prompted more than 300,000 to emigrate to Turkey after Bulgarian
authorities gave them passports.
   Lilov blamed longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov for the
name change, which he said had harmed Bulgaria's reputation abroad.
   Zhivkov was ousted last month as part of the wave of reform that
has swept across Eastern Europe.
   ``The Central Committee has determined that no documents exist
in the files of the Politburo (to prove) that such a decision was
ever formally adopted,'' said Lilov, who was not a member of the
Politburo at the time the name change was ordered.
   ``This represents one of the peaks of Zhivkov's
irresponsibility,'' Lilov told reporters.
   While the Central Committee was still in session, about 2,000
journalists gathered in front of the party headquarters demanding
freedom of the press.
   At the rally, a speaker of Moslem faith said the first birth
certificate with a Moslem name in the past 10 years _ that of
one-month-old Osman Bajram Husseinov _ had just been issued by the
municipal registrar.
   In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Turkey was
pleased by the decision to revoke the name change.
   Earlier Friday, thousands of ethnic Turks and Pomaks braved a
blizzard to stage a noisy but peaceful demonstration through
downtown Sofia for the second straight day, chanting ``Unity'' and
``Give us back our names.''
   About 6,000 of the protesters circled the parliament building,
vowing not to disperse until their ``problems are resolved once and
for all.''
   ``We will remain here whatever happens, until persecution is
stopped and our demands are met,'' said Milen Rusev, one of the
protesters.
   He said that in 1980 he had been forced ``at gunpont'' to change
his Turkish name of Mehmet Refatu.
   At the Central Committee meeting, the date of an extraordinary
party congress was moved up from March 19 to Jan. 30.
   The official news agency BTA quoted Andrei Lukanov, the No. 2
man in the Politburo, as saying the decision was prompted by ``the
dynamic development of the political situation in the country and
the need to speed up the renewal process in the party.''
   Lukanov reportedly also called for ``a complete and final
de-Stalinization of the party,'' adding that ``the party shall be
one of dialogue and social consensus.''
   At the news conference, Lukanov was asked if the Communist Party
would concede defeat if it lost in free elections scheduled for May
1990.
   ``In a democracy the possibility of losing elections is always
present _ this should be respected by all political forces,
including the Communist Party,'' Lukanov said.
   An end to the party's guaranteed monopoly on power is one of the
main demands of the Union of Democratic Forces, an umbrella forum
of independent political groups, trade unionists and
environmentalists.

   Two Indians were beheaded Friday for
the murder of an Egyptian, the Interior Ministry said.
   Saudi Arabia is governed by Islamic law that prescribes
beheading for murder, the cutting off of a hand for theft and
stoning for adultery. In recent years the death penalty also has
been applied to drug smugglers.
   Executions of criminals convicted by Islamic courts are a common
occurrence on Fridays in Saudi Arabia. The beheadings are carried
out in public squares opposite mosques after Moslem Sabbath
congregational prayers.
   The announcement said the two Indians, whose names were given in
Arabic as Lingia Buhoma Bontor and Makla Kanka Malaya, fatally beat
the Egyptian Abdul-Hameed bin Mohammed bin Oweiss during a robbery
attempt.
   The crime, trial and beheadings took place in Najran, on the
western side of the desert kingdom.

<TEXT>
   Both Communist and non-Communist leaders of Poland, the country
at the vanguard of the East bloc's democratic revolution, joined in
cheering Vaclav Havel's election as president of Czechoslovakia on
Friday.
   Western European leaders hailed the move as another step in
Czechoslovakia's march toward democracy.
   The Bush administration said the election of the playwright,
once a jailed dissident, ``marks a fitting end to a year of
astonishing change in Eastern Europe.''
   Havel, an internationally acclaimed playwright and opposition
leader, was elected in a unanimous vote of his nation's Parliament
as the first non-Communist president of Czechoslovakia in 41 years.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in Poland welcomed the choice of
Havel ``with great joy'' and wished him strength in carrying out
his new responsibilities, according to the official Polish PAP news
agency.
   In his telegram, Walesa said: ``Czechoslovakia needs people like
you. The duty of a continuation of the chosen path of new reforms
will rest with them.''
   Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former activist in the Solidarity labor
union, also sent cables of congratulations to Havel, PAP reported.
   Mazowiecki was elected as the East Bloc's first non-Cmmunist
head of government on Aug. 24, paving the way for a wave of reform
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany sent a telegram to Havel
promising that West Germany is ready to support Czechoslovakia in
its pursuit of reforms.
   ``The new Europe of freedom needs a democratic and dynamic
Czechoslovakia,'' Kohl said.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker said in a message:
``Dialogue and cooperation should accompany us in the future
emergence of a united Europe.''
   Havel's first foreign visit, announced Friday, will be to East
Germany and West Germany on Jan. 2.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said of Havel's election:
``We greatly welcome it. His commitment to the ideals of democracy
has been repeatedly and courageously demonstrated.''
   ``We are confident that he will promote Czechoslovakia's
peaceful transition towards a truly democratic society, a process
in which Mr. Havel has already played a crucial part,'' the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   He described Havel's assumption of power as ``a momentous step
in the postwar history of our continent.''
   In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand also offered
congratulations.
   ``Knowing the eminent role you have played in the struggle for
reestablishment of democratic institutions in Czechoslovakia, I am
convinced you will be able to carry out successfully the heavy
responsibility confided in you,'' Mitterrand's telegram said.
   President Francesco Cossiga of Italy said: ``The Parliament's
choice ... represents a symbolic stage in the glorious march that
the peoples of the Czechoslovak republic have embarked on toward
ever higher goals of freedom, democracy and political pluralism.''
   In Texas on holiday, President Bush pledged U.S. support for the
changes in Czechoslovakia.
   Bush said Havel's election ``is living proof of what Mr. Havel
has called the `power of the powerless' to bring about peaceful
democratic change,'' according to White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.

   The remains of an American teacher were
discovered in Panama on Friday, and his daughter blamed Panamanians
for his death.
   The American _ the third U.S. civilian to die since the conflict
began _ was identified by his daughter as Raymond Dragseth, a
teacher at the Panama Canal College, a Defense Department facility.
   Dragseth was reported to be the uncle of Richard Paul, a Defense
Department dependent who was killed a week ago. An American who was
working in Panama as a school teacher, Candy Helin, was killed
shortly after the invasion began.
   The Pentagon has said previously that 23 servicemen have died
since the Dec. 20 U.S. military intervention in Panama.
   Carolyn Dragseth, appearing at a news conference from Panama
broadcast by CNN, blamed Panamanians for the abduction of her
father, saying ``They just took my father _ I don't know why.''
   ``They came here looking for Americans,'' she said. CNN said
Raymond Dragseth was abducted from the family's apartment several
hours after the American invasion began.
   ``They just took my father. I don't know why. There's no
apparent reason why my father should have died.'' CNN said that
Dragseth's wife told them she had tried to convince the Panamanians
who abducted her husband that he was European.
   When asked whether her family had been contacted by the U.S.
Embassy, Carolyn Dragseth said, ``They've been keeping in touch
with us, especially since we, my family, located the body.''
   The Pentagon said the remains of ``an individual'' have been
recovered and once autopsy and identification efforts are complete
additional details will be provided.
   At the State Department, an official said U.S. authorities were
informed that Panamanian officials are in the process of exhuming a
person whose description would fit that of a private American
citizen. The official had no additional information.

<HEAD>Israeli Aide to Noriega Led Bungled Spy Mission</HEAD>

   The former Israeli spy who was arrested in
Panama as a top aide to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega headed one of
the most bungled operations in the history of Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency.
   Michael Harari, whose arrest by U.S. troops was announced
Thursday, was described by an American diplomat in Panama as a
security adviser to Noriega and an instructor to the Panamanian
Defense Forces.
   Israeli newspapers reported that Harari had considerable
influence in Panamanian politics. He was once appointed by Noriega
as Panama's honorary consul general in Israel.
   But he is best known, according to the daily Yediot Ahronot, as
the head of a team of 15 Mossad agents who set out to kill a
leading Palestinian terrorist but instead murdered a hapless
Moroccan-born waiter in a Norwegian resort.
   Spokesmen for the Israeli Foreign and Defense ministries refused
comment Friday on Harari's arrest in Panama, saying he was a
private citizen. But his exploits have been described extensively
in newspapers and books.
   Yediot said Harari helped Noriega recruit Israeli mercenaries
for his personal bodyguard over the last year and noted that a
second Israeli, Eliezer Ben Giton, surrendered to U.S. troops
outside the Vatican mission in Panama, saying he was ``responsible
for the personal security of General Manuel Noriega.''
   The Haaretz daily said Harari was convinced to leave Panama last
year by Israel officials, who were under strong U.S. pressure to
cut contacts with Noriega. But the former Mossad agent later
returned.
   Israel's ambassador to Panama, Reuven Ben-Eliezer, told Israel
army radio he did not know Harari.
   ``I don't know who Harari is, I didn't see him, I didn't meet
him, I didn't get orders from him, and he also didn't receive''
orders from Israel's embassy in Panama, Ben-Eliezer said in the
interview broadcast Friday.
   ``He is a private Israeli. I don't know what he did there. He
did business and he was appointed by Noriega as honorary general
consul for Panama in Israel,'' Ben-Eliezer said.
   Harari, 62, was born in Tel Aviv in a religious family that
objected to his joining the Israeli army. He eventually became a
colonel.
   Yediot said Harari was chief of Mossad's special operations when
he headed the unit trying to kill the leader of the Palestinian
Black September group, which massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the
1972 Munich Olympics.
   The case is described in the book ``The Quest for the Red
Prince'' by Israeli authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Eitan Haber.
Haber, now the spokesman for Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
refused to comment on the case.
   In the book, the team leader is referred to only as ``Mike,''
but sources familiar with the case say it was Harari.
   According to the accounts, Harari's squad traced the man they
believed to be Ali Hassan Salameh, known as the Red Prince, to the
resort of Lillehammer, Norway.
   Two agents killed the man on May 23, 1973, but the victim turned
out to be Ahmed Boushiki, a Moroccan-born waiter living in
Lillehammer with his Norwegian wife.
   The embarrassment was heightened when six of the Israeli agents
involved in the mission were arrested by Norwegian police.
   The real Salameh was eventually killed when a bomb planted by
Israeli agents engulfed his car in flames on a Beirut street on
Jan. 22, 1979.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Ellis II, brother-in-law of President
Bush and a prominent businessman, died Friday of a stroke. He was
67 years old.
   Ellis was married to Nancy Walker Bush Ellis, sister of the
president. He had been hospitalized for the past two weeks at
Massachusetts General Hospital and had undergone an intestinal
operation Monday, said his son, Alexander III.
   President Bush was ``very close to the family. He has been in
touch constantly through this two and a half weeks,'' Alexander III
said.
   Ellis was born April 9, 1922, in Cambridge, son of Alexander
Ellis, the founder of Fairfield and Elllis, an insurance brokerage.
   He attended Yale University and served as a lieutenant in the
82nd Airborne Division in Europe during World War II. He was
wounded during the Battle of the Bulge.
   He married Nancy Bush in 1946. He joined his father's firm and
became president during the late 1960s and chief executive officer
in 1975.
   Ellis was active in state Republican politics, serving as a
state committeeman and a delegate to the 1964 Republican
convention. He also served on the board of the YMCA and an overseer
for Massachusetts General Hospital.
   In 1986, he sold Fairfield and Ellis to Carroon and Black, a New
York-based insurance brokerage, but remained as chairman of the
company's Boston office and was active in the business until his
recent hospitalization.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Alexander
Ellis III, John Prescott Ellis and Josiah Wear Ellis; a daughter,
Nancy Walker Ellis Black; and four grandchildren.
   The funeral is scheduled Tuesday morning, the family said.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Friday
rejected a Vatican claim that the United States is ``an occupying
power'' in Panama, while acknowledging that the diplomatic standoff
over deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega is likely to persist.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Vatican
was ``doing a fine job'' in handling the Noriega situation. He said
the United States must ``calmly go along'' while Roman Catholic
Church officials decide what do about Noriega, who has been holed
up at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City since Christmas Eve.
   But State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, reflecting
mounting tensions between Washington and Vatican City, took issue
with a Vatican description of the United States as an occupation
force in Panama.
   ``We are down there with the consent of the government of
Panama, the legitimately elected leaders of Panama,'' Boucher said.
``That means we're not an occupying power.''
   Fitzwater, however, said talks with Roman Catholic Church
officials were proceeding in ``a positive vein.'' He declined to
get into an argument with Vatican City about U.S. actions in and
around the embassy where Noriega has been holed up.
   The press secretary answered questions about the diplomatic and
legal jockeying as Bush, some 60 miles away in Beeville, Texas,
wound up three days of hunting and fishing.
   Fitzwater's remarks appeared aimed at soothing increasingly
harsh exchanges between the Vatican and the United States over
Noriega, who took refuge in the Vatican Embassy on Christmas Eve.
That was five days after Bush ordered U.S. military invasion forces
into Panama.
   Fitzwater said he did not know whether U.S. troops, ringing the
Vatican embassy where Noriega is hiding in Panama City, would stop
bombarding the building with nerve-shattering rock-and-roll music.
   At the Vatican earlier, spokesman Joaquin Navarro had complained
about the activities of U.S. troops who have surrounded the Panama
City embassy to prevent Noriega from slipping away.
   ``An occupying power cannot interfere with the works of a
diplomatic mission nor can it demand that a person seeking asylum
in that mission be handed over to it,'' Navarro said.
   Asked about this Friday, Fitzwater said, ``The Vatican's doing a
fine job. ... We appreciate their efforts. We continue to work with
them in a very positive way. We think that they've taken a very
serious and constructive role in this episode.''
   Navarro did say the papal nuncio in Panama City was trying to
convince Noriega to quit his refuge.
   The United States wants Noriega handed over to stand trial on
two drug trafficking indictments. The decision to militarily
intervene on Dec. 20 ended a two-year standoff in which the U.S.
government had sought with words and economic sanctions to topple
Noriega, who had thwarted efforts to restore democratic rule in the
Central American country.
   Fitzwater also said he wasn't upset about a report in The
Washington Times Friday, which said an errant phone call from the
State Department to the U.S. Embassy in Panama City could have
tipped eavesdropping Panamanians to the U.S. invasion 48 hours in
advance.
   ``No one seems to know whether it's true or not,'' he said.
Fitzwater said that Noriega had ``an extensive intelligence
operation.'' But he added that ``it's history now.''
   Summing up where things stood nearly a week after the United
States and the Vatican commenced talks about Noriega, Fitzwater
said, ``We can't predict how long it will take'' to resolve the
custody issue.
   ``This matter has to play out,'' he said. `` ... We'll just
calmly go along.''
   ``It's a very difficult situation, very tense circumstances,''
Fitzwater added. ``They are managing a difficult situation on the
ground there in Panama. They have been very cooperative with us
certainly and with other countries in trying to resolve the issue.''
   ``So our interest is in establishing a harmonious
relationship,'' the spokesman said.
   Asked whether the United States would seek to physically prevent
Noriega's removal to a third country, Fitzwater said, ``We won't
speculate. We'd like to have him in the United States.''
   Fitzwater also would disclose nothing about which of Noriega's
cronies have left the Vatican embassy. ``There's just not much that
we have to say or want to say while this is going on,'' he said.
   ``There are some things we don't know and there's some things we
know and just won't tell you. We just don't think it's helpful,''
the spokesman said.
   Earlier, Bush sent ``warm'' congratulations from Beeville to
Vaclav Havel on his election as president of Czechoslovakia, and
pledged U.S. support for the rebirth of democracy in the East
European nation.
   The White House said the election of the once dissident
playwright ``marks a fitting end to a year of astonishing change in
Eastern Europe.''
   Later the president flew to Houston, where he will remain
through New Year's Day, and dined with national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft and first lady Barbara Bush. Fitzwater said the
president had nothing to report on Panama but likely would get a
full briefing from Scowcroft.
   Bush and his party bagged 20 quail during his 2{-day hunting
vacation onb the Lazy F ranch owned by his long-time friend Will
Farish, Fiztwater said. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
caught a 19-pound turkey which, cleaned and dressed, Bush and Baker
brought with them on the flight to Houston.
   The Bushes will make a sidetrip Sunday to two military hospitals
in San Antonio to visit servicemen wounded in Panama. The president
will stop in Montgomery, Ala., to go bass fishing on New Year's Day
before returning to the White House late Monday.

   Holdout loyalist sharpshooters with infrared
telescopic sights are trying to pick off Romania's revolutionary
leaders, a member of the new leadership was quoted Friday as saying.
   Silviu Brucan of Romania's ruling National Salvation Front was
quoted in the independent daily newspaper Le Monde as saying most
members of the feared Securitate, or security police, had given
themselves up.
   ``It's only a few fanatics with some telescopic sights who
threaten us now,'' he was quoted as saying. ``They now have only
one goal: try to decapitate the movement by assassinating us.''
   In an office at the Romanian Foreign Ministry with the curtains
drawn, Brucan said the security police were able to use their
better equipment to devastating effect, even in total darkness, Le
Monde reported.
   ``They have rifles with infrared scopes. I saw with my own eyes
12 soldiers killed in front of the Central Committee building, at
night, with a bullet right in the middle of the forehead,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   ``In those days, we only moved around in armored vehicles. And
each time, our vehicle was hit by their gunfire. They knew we were
inside. They were everywhere,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Brucan also defended the decision to try and quickly execute
deposed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena,
the newspaper said.
   ``If the Securitate had freed them, Romania would have seen a
bloodbath, an atrocious internal war,'' he was quoted as saying.
``We had no choice.''
   He said the military tribunal conducted the trial of the
Ceausescus on Christmas Day, Monday morning, and executed them at
midday.
   Brucan is the former Romanian ambassador to Washington who broke
with Ceausescu.

   Panamanian boxing champion Roberto
Duran said Friday he hopes the use of his luxurious apartment by
U.S. troops will count toward the community service he has been
sentenced to in a Florida court for driving while intoxicated.
   Duran said he is letting his penthouse apartment be used by the
soldiers so they can keep an eye on the Vatican Embassy, where
deposed ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has taken refuge.
   But mostly, he hopes it will get him off the hook.
   ``I want a letter of recommendation, a certificate of good
conduct, from American authorities here to show the judge in Miami.
That should compensate for the community service,'' he said.
   Early this week, U.S. forces broke down the door of Duran's home
on the 22nd floor of a highrise beside the embassy compound. The
soldiers have since maintained a constant presence there.
   ``If I were anybody else, I would be charging them or throw them
out,'' Duran said in an interview. ``They're taking showers,
sleeping there. The house is suffering some wear and tear. I give
them food, too. And I'm not charging them a cent.''
   Duran and his wife, Felicidad, were not living in the penthouse
when Noriega fled to the embassy Sunday and U.S. forces descended
on the exclusive seaside neighborhood of Punta Paitilla.
   The middleweight fighter, who earlier this month lost a
much-heralded but lackluster title bout to Sugar Ray Leonard, owns
several homes in Panama.
   More than 100 U.S. soldiers have sealed off the streets around
the embassy with wire, roadblocks, tanks, armored cars and
sandbagged machine-gun nests. Entrance and exit from Duran's
building is strictly controlled.
   Duran was arrested Jan. 14 in Miami for driving while
intoxicated. He pleaded no contest in county court five months
later.
   The judge gave him six months probation, suspended his license,
fined him $250 and ordered him to do 50 hours of community service
by giving boxing instruction to Miami children.
   But Duran thinks his cooperation with the American forces should
suffice as payment of the debt he owes to U.S. society.
   U.S. military authorities said Friday they were considering
Duran's request for written acknowledgement of his cooperation.

<HEAD>Report: Thousands of Women Died from Illegal Abortions</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Romanian women died over
the past few years from illegal or botched abortions because of
deposed leader Nicolae Ceausescu's near-ban on the procedure, a
report said.
   The report Thursday came after Romania's new interim government
lifted Ceausescu's ban, which permitted few legal exceptions.
   Ceausescu instituted the abortion ban in 1966 to encourage
procreation. He also banned the sale of contraceptives.
   Even before Ceausescu's ouster and execution, there had been
reports in the official press of illegal abortions and doctors
charging phenomenal sums for the service.
   ``The criminal act (the abortion restrictions) caused the death
of thousands of women, many of them mothers of two to four
children,'' the official Agerpres news agency said.
   Agerpres also quoted a leading medical official as saying ``a
great many crippled babies were born'' because of inadequate
maternity care, malnutrition and other complications.
   Under the 1966 law, abortions were permitted only for mothers
who already had at least five children, in cases where childbirth
could endanger the woman's life, when the pregnancy resulted from
rape or incest, or when one of the parents suffered from serious
disease that could result in birth defects.
   Mothers were given monthly allowances that varied according to
the number of children they had.
   Still, the entire population was impoverished by the Ceausescu
regime and for many, having children made their situation even
worse.
   Dr. Bogdan Marinescu, head of the Giulesti Maternity House in
Bucharest, said that over the last eight years nearly 1,400 women
died from complications related to abortions in the capital alone,
Agerpres said.
   The figure for Bucharest is apt to be even higher, Agerpres
said, suggesting that hospitals and clinics attempted to hide the
fact they had conducted abortions.
   ``Their number is by far bigger ... because, when in agony, many
of them (pregnant mothers) were transferred to die in other medical
departments,'' Agerpres said.
   It was not clear from the report how many of the purported
deaths were a result of illegal abortions.
   Agerpres said Ceausescu's abortion ban was ``an aggression
against millions of women, children and, ultimately families, the
very national being.''

   Stiff high altitude winds forced an

first commercial Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese

   When the countdown reached the five-minute mark, the launch team
held it there for nearly an hour while officials assessed
last-minute data received from weather balloons.
   With the shear winds about 30,000 feet up still too high, the
effort was called off once again. The launch was rescheduled for
7:07 p.m. Saturday.
   Liftoff originally was scheduled Dec. 7, but technical and

   The rocket is to boost into orbit communications satellites for
the Japanese Communications Satellite Co. and the British Ministry

<TEXT>
   Thousands of beleaguered Peruvians prayed for
peace Friday during a national minute of silence called by church
and government officials, but even that brief moment was marred by
violence.
   The same day, the government renewed emergency regulations for
60 days in eight departments and one province. Such regulations
have been used since 1982 to combat terrorism.
   Precisely at noon Friday, traffic stopped, factories became
quiet, and people paused for a moment of reflection as one of the
most violent years in the country's history came to a close.
   Hundreds gathered in Lima's main square to hear an address by
Cardinal Juan Landazuri, but as the minute of silence began a small
group of striking state workers clashed with riot police in the
middle of the square.
   Witnesses said police quickly surrounded the group of about 10
workers, beat them with riot clubs and hauled them away.
   As the minute of silence ended, church bells rang and horns
blared as motorists showed their support for the vigil, the third
consecutive year the minute of prayer has been observed.
   Peru is being wracked by a leftist insurgency that has taken
more than 17,000 lives since 1980. At least 2,500 people have
disappeared.
   Sen. Enrique Bernales, head of a special commission on violence,
said this week that nearly 3,000 people have been killed in
political violence this year.
   ``Ten years of violence, of terrorism, of destruction and of
death have painfully torn apart the heart of our people,''
Landazuri said.
   Witnesses said traffic proceeded normally in outlying suburbs of
the capital, as many people ignored the call to prayer.
   The government announced the extension of emergency rules in a
decree published in the official gazette, El Peruano.
   The state of emergency regulations gives broad powers to the
military to fight leftist insurgents and suspends some civil
liberties, including freedom of movement and guarantees against
search and seizure.
   Such restrictions cover about one-third of this Andean nation,
affecting more than half its 21 million residents.

people how they could do this themselves,'' Rick Gibson said
Friday. ``People will be able to crush other creatures in the
comfort of their own homes sort of thing to see what sort of
patterns they get.''
   Ah, but is it art?
   Gibson insists the killing will be humane and legal, and Sniffy
will be well-cared for right up to the end. ``I have no desire to
mistreat him at all. I'm going to be treating him humanely at all
times,'' he said.
   Ingrid Pollack of the Vancouver Humane Society said the killing
would be ridiculous and sick. She said the society will try to halt
Gibson's plans.
   Gibson has created a guillotine-like apparatus to execute his
plan. There is a cage for the rat on the bottom. The weight slides
down a pole. He tested it on a squash.
   ``I've had this idea mulling around in my mind for some time,''
Gibson said.
   He plans to roll the apparatus in front of the Vancouver Library
on Jan. 6 for a Saturday afternoon performance for a few of his
friends.
   Killing a rat for art is no worse than trapping or poisoning it
as a pest, Gibson said.
   He bought Sniffy from a pet shop and says it otherwise probably
would have ended up as a meal for a snake or a lizard.
   ``For the life of me I can't tell the difference between what
I'm doing and what they do when they have rats in the house,''
Gibson said. ``So I don't know what the fuss is about, if there is
any.''
   Gibson, 38, recently returned to Canada after six years in
England. He plans to return in February to appeal a conviction for
outraging public decency by making earrings out of freeze-dried
human fetal tissue.
   In Vancouver last July, Gibson said, police stopped him from
consuming a slice of human testicle he acquired from a medical
supply store. He said he was able to complete the art performance
in September.
   ``I just wanted to be the first cannibal in Vancouver to go
public,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, who left the
governor's mansion in 1987 as he traded jobs with then-Congressman
John R. McKernan, announced Friday he will challenge McKernan for
governor next year.
   Brennan, a Democrat, opened his campaign with an attack on
McKernan, a Republican who has not formally announced he is running
for re-election but makes no secret of his plans to run.
   ``Maine can do better than this,'' Brennan said. ``I think Maine
people deserve a better government than this. These are challenging
times. I want to get Maine moving forward again.''
   McKernan responded with a statement that defended his record and
accused Brennan of being indecisive throughout several months of
speculation about whether he would run.
   ``Clearly, this has not been an easy decision for Congressman
Brennan, as he has agonized publicly over a candidacy for months,''
McKernan responded.
   ``His hesitancy, his delay in reaching a decision until the last
possible moment, his seeming paralysis in addressing the issue of a
gubernatorial candidacy is, I think, revealing.''
   Brennan said he had made up his mind to run on Friday morning,
and he had not yet plotted out his campaign strategy.
   Brennan's statement said a formal announcement of his candidacy
would come later. McKernan promised a formal announcement of his
own candidacy in the ``not-so-distant future.''
   McKernan was making no comment beyond his prepared statement,
according to a spokeswoman in his Augusta office.
   Brennan's announcement Friday drew an immediate endorsement from
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, who defeated
Brennan in the 1974 Democratic gubernatorial primary.
   That election eventually was won by independent James B. Longley.
   It will be the fourth run for governor for Brennan, 55, who has
been in public life for a quarter of a century. He was a state
legislator when he entered his first primary and lost to Mitchell.
   Brennan went on to capture the Blaine House in 1978, serving the
maximum two terms before running successfully for the U.S. House of
Representatives in 1986. He was re-elected handily two years later.
   Brennan grew up on Portland's Munjoy Hill, the son of a
longshoreman. After Army duty, he went to Boston College on the GI
bill and then entered law school in Maine.
   After three terms in the Maine House, he was elected Cumberland
County district attorney in 1970. Two years later he was elected to
the state Senate and served as Democratic floor leader.
   Following his 1974 primary defeat, Brennan was elected by the
Legislature to serve as attorney general, a post he held until his
1978 election as governor.
   Four years later, Brennan carried all 16 counties as he defeated
Republican nominee Charles L. Cragin.
   Brennan acknowledged at the time that it was uncommon for
governors to go on to the House, giving up the perquisites of a
chief executive to become one vote among 435.
   However, he was assigned to the House Armed Services Committee _
a rarity for a freshman _ as well as Merchant Marine and Fisheries.

   Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. North won hearty
applause for his musical stage debut Friday night as narrator of
``Peter and the Wolf,'' but among the youngsters in the audience he
was clearly upstaged by the wolf.
   ``It was right nice,'' said Aquil Robinson, 12. ``What I liked
best was when the wolf ate the duck.''
   North, 46, who is appealing his May 4 conviction on three felony
charges in connection with the Iran-Contra affair, accepted an
invitation from Maria Fisher, president of the Beethoven Society,
to read the narration for Sergei Prokofiev's musical tale for
children.
   The retired Marine colonel and former White House national
security aide wore a tuxedo for his half-hour performance in the
main ballroom of a downtown hotel before about 1,000 spectators.
   The audience included North's probation officer, Ralph Ardito,
and 100 inner-city children from the Save Our Youth anti-drug
program in Washington, where North is serving his sentence of 1,200
hours of community service. He also was given two years' probation
and fined $150,000.
   North read with lively expression and never missed a cue from
the orchestra conductor. He said it was his first stage appearance
since he played ``the bad guy'' in a high school production of
``How the West Was Won'' in his hometown of Philmont, N.Y., nearly
30 years ago.
   ``It was wonderful,'' said former North associate Robert W.
Owen, who saw the show with his 2-year-old daughter Katie. ``Ollie
may have a new profession,'' said Owen, who once served as North's
liaison with the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``He was very good,'' said conductor Richard Weilenmann. ``Some
narrators are exaggerated and overblown, but North read very
naturally, as if he were reading to his own children.''
   ``Ollie's doing it because he's a friend of mine,'' said Mrs.
Fisher, whose musical society sponsored the concert. She said she
has admired North since she watched his televised testimony at the
congressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987.
   North, who reportedly charges $25,000 for every speech he makes,
narrated ``Peter and the Wolf'' for free, Mrs. Fisher said.

<HEAD>Taiwan Found Liable for Official Who Ordered Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Taiwan is legally
responsible for the acts of a military official who ordered the
1984 killing of a Taiwanese-American journalist, a federal appeals
court ruled Friday.
   The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals not only
reinstates a $200 million suit by the widow of journalist Henry Liu
but also links the Taiwanese government to the actions of its
defense intelligence chief, Vice Admiral Wong Hsi-Lin, who has been
convicted in Taiwan's own courts.
   ``Wong's act was committed within the scope of his employment as
director of the DIB (Defense Intelligence Bureau),'' the court
said. ``We conclude that the ROC (Republic of China) is liable.''
   The ruling, if upheld, would virtually guarantee that Taiwan
would be found liable for the murder itself, leaving only the
question of damages to be resolved.
   ``I read the decision to say that the Republic of China is
liable under California law for the murder of Henry Liu,'' said
Gerard Harper, a lawyer for Helen Liu, who sued for her husband's
death.
   ``It's the first time, to my knowledge, that in a contested case
a foreign state has been held liable for a murder in the United
States.''
   ``My intention was to find the truth of this case, because the
trial held in Taiwan was orchestrated,'' Mrs. Liu said Friday.
   ``The reasons why they had to kill Henry, they didn't ask in the
(Taiwanese) court. ... I want people to know the real reasons, the
mentality of the Taiwan regime. He (her husband) was trying to get
Taiwan to be a more democratic country.''
   John Martel, a lawyer for Taiwan, said he had not seen the
ruling and could not say whether it would be appealed. But he said
any implication that the government was responsible for the murder
was false.
   The ruling is one of several recent decisions allowing lawsuits
against foreign officials for allegedly ordering crimes in the
United States.
   Earlier this month, a jury in Seattle found the estate of former
Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos liable for the 1981 killings
of two Philippine-American dissidents and labor union activists.
   Liu, 52, a Taiwanese-born U.S. citizen and author of a critical
biography of Taiwan President Chiang Ching-Kuo, was shot to death
in October 1984 at his home in Daly City, south of San Francisco,
by gunmen who were later traced to the United Bamboo Gang in Taiwan.
   Military courts in Taiwan convicted five men of responsibility
for the murder, including Admiral Wong, who was found to have
ordered the gangsters to silence Liu. He was sentenced to life in
prison. A sixth man was convicted of murder in a California court.
   While finding that Wong was motivated by Liu's criticism of the
government as well as a personal grudge, the Taiwanese courts
concluded that Taiwan's government was not responsible for Wong's
unauthorized actions.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Lynch cited that conclusion in
September 1987 when he dismissed Mrs. Liu's suit against the
government.
   Lynch said Wong was acting outside the scope of his employment.
A U.S. court could not authorize a further inquiry into the
conclusions of the Taiwanese courts, Lynch said, without involving
the judiciary in sensitive areas of a foreign government's national
security and intelligence affairs, causing potential embarassment
to U.S. foreign policy.
   The appeals court, in a 3-0 ruling, disagreed with both of
Lynch's conclusions.
   The opinion by Judge Robert Boochever said the relationship of
Wong's actions and his job as intelligence chief was shown by the
factual findings of the Taiwan courts.
   As for the Republic of China, although the suit may affect its
government financially, ``it does not affront its sovereignty and
can cause no more embarrassment than the exposures already made by
the ROC courts,'' Boochever said.

<TEXT>
   Presiding Bishop James Oglethrope (J.O.)
Patterson Sr., leader of the 3.7 million-member Church of God in
Christ, died of cancer Friday. He was 77.
   Patterson retired earlier this year because of the illness but
retained his title as leader of the Memphis-based international
church, the world's largest black Pentecostal Holiness denomination.
   He died about 6 a.m. at William F. Bold Hospital in Memphis,
said Bishop H. Jenkins Bell, adjutant general of the COGIC.
   Patterson was elected presiding bishop of the church in 1968
when founder Charles H. Mason died in 1961.
   ``He (Patterson) brought creditability to the church,'' said
Elder Calvin Burns. ``He help make us a recognized and respected
denomination and not just a sect.''
   Patterson will be succeeded by Bishop E. H. Ford of Chicago, the
denomination's first vice president, who will preside over its
12-member board of bishops until the next convention election in
1992.
   Patterson was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in April but
refused to be treated for the disease because, he said ``the
treatment of prayer is better than chemotherapy.''
   For the past 48 years Patterson served as senior pastor of the
Pentecostal Temple Institutional Church of God in Christ in
Memphis, where his son, J.O. Patterson Jr., will succeed him as the
church's pastor.
   Patterson is also survived by a daughter, Janet Patterson, and
second wife Mary Patterson. Patterson's first wife, Deborah, the
daughter of COGIC founder Charles Mason, died in 1985.
   The church was established in 1906 in Jackson, Miss., by Mason,
then an independent Baptist minister who said he had been affected
by the Holiness movement.
   Its doctrine is similar to that of the Pentecostal Holiness
Church. Members believe in the trinity, nonmedical or ``holiness''
healing, baptism by immersion, the Lord's Supper and foot-washing.
   In 1987 the church reported 10,500 congregations and 3,896
ministers in the U.S.; 21 congregations and 33 ministers in Canada.
The church has about 3 million members in the United States and
700,000 in 43 other countries around the world.

   A Greek freighter's 28-member crew struggled to
keep their 600-foot ship afloat Friday, but the vessel was not in
immediate danger of sinking, said the captain of a tanker that came
to the rescue.
   Sailors were trying to pump water out of the freighter Bulka,
which was about 800 miles northeast of Hawaii, Barry Arrett,
captain of the tanker Chevron Colorado, said by radio.
   ``I can't determine if he's going to sink or not sink, but from
what I can see, and from my discussions with the master of the
vessel, he has no intention of abandoning ship,'' Arrett said.
``They're in no immediate danger.''
   The Bulka was listing 6 degrees to starboard and was down 40
feet at the bow, said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Dennis
Hubbard. Earlier in the day, the bow had been down only 15 feet.
   Hubbard said earlier that the situation did not look good, and
said it wasn't known whether the crew was going to abandon ship.
   The Colorado was 165 miles from the Bulka when it received a
distress call from the ship Thursday night. The tanker reached the
freighter around 7:30 a.m. Friday, and delivered three pumps
air-dropped to it by the Coast Guard.
   The Coast Guard cutter Sassafrass was headed to the vessel from
Honolulu, and was expected to reach the ship sometime Saturday,
Hubbard said.
   Weather was not a problem, Arrett said. Skies were mostly sunny,
with southwesterly skies at 12 knots and low southwest swells.
Winds hit 18 knots earlier in the day.
   The Colorado mostly provided communications assistance, and was
on hand in case the Bulka had to be abandoned.
   The Bulka's captain did not know what caused the ship to take on
water, Arrett said.
   The ship, which is owned by the Greek company Bacolistas and
Sons and based in Athens, had been headed for South Korea with a
load of scrap metal, Arrett said.
   The crew was equipped with life vests and life rafts.

   Pro-Cuban rebels dynamited a Mormon temple in
an interior city and left leaflets threatening church workers and
U.S. drug agents, a radio report said Friday. It said the threat
was in response to the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Police said the rebels also bombed a bank in suburban Lima.
   In neighboring Chile, suspected members of another radical
leftist group doused a Mormon chapel in Santiago with gasoline and
set it on fire.
   All three attacks caused damage but no casualties.
   Several temples of the Utah-based Mormon church and U.S.
cultural centers have been attacked in both countries in recent
days.
   Radio Programas broadcast its report from the jungle city of
Tarapoto, 435 miles north of Lima, saying rebels of the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement bombed the Mormon temple there Thursday
night.
   The report said the rebels left behind leaflets telling Mormon
church workers and U.S. drug agents to leave the department of San
Martin within 10 days.
   Authorities in Tarapoto could not be reached Friday to confirm
the story, and a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Lima said he had no
information.
   The U.S.-built anti-drug base at Santa Lucia is in San Martin
department. Twenty to 40 Americans, including agents, contract
helicopter pilots and mechanics, are stationed there to help
Peruvian police in raids against clandestine airstrips and drug
laboratories used in the cocaine trade.
   Tupac Amaru rebels dynamited three Mormon temples and a
Peruvian-American cultural center Tuesday in the northern coastal
city of Chiclayo and another center Friday in Arequipa in the
southern highlands.
   The pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru launched its armed insurgency against
Peru's elected government in 1984. The group takes its name from a
18th century mestizo revolutionary who fought Spanish colonial rule
in the Andean highlands.
   In the bank bombing, police said Tupac Amaru rebels detonated
explosives at the Bandesco bank branch in residential San Isidro.
   In Friday's attack in Santiago, police said the fire was quickly
extinguished at the small chapel in Villa Frei, a working-class
neighborhood.
   The Lautaro Commando, a radical leftist organization, claimed
responsibility for the attack, police said.
   It was the fifth attack on Mormon chapels since Sunday in
Santiago and provincial cities. In the other attacks, four chapels
were damaged by bombs. No one claimed responsibility for those
blasts.
   In one case, the attackers wrote slogans on chapel walls
condemning the Panamanian invasion.
   Late Thursday, a bomb exploded at the bathroom of the U.S.
cultural center in downtown Santiago, causing damage but no
victims, police said.
   The Lautaro group took responsibility for dozens of attacks on
Mormon chapels in the last few years, saying the church is ``a tool
of Yankee imperialism.''
   The group takes its name from an Indian chief who fought the
Spanish conquerors in the 16th century.

   An 18-year-old paratrooper killed in the
Panamanian invasion was among six U.S. servicemen buried with
military honors Friday.
   Army Pvt. James A. Tabor, Jr., who died one week ago when U.S.
forces invaded to dislodge dictator Manuel Noriega, was eulogized
at a ceremony in Montrose, Colo., by his great-uncle.
   ``From time to time we must enforce our principles of liberty
and human dignity with action,'' said retired Army Col. Vernon
Ebert.
   ``This serves notice again that this country is prepared to give
more than rhetoric,'' Ebert said. ``Jim and the others did not die
in vain. They went out in a noble way, serving their country with
idealism and pride.''
   Tabor was among 23 U.S. servicemen who died in the invasion.
   More than 700 mourners packed the Montrose Christian Church for
the military service for Tabor, who would have been 19 on Jan. 16.
Tabor was buried in Olathe beside his grandfather.
   An Army squad from Fort Carson fired a 21-gun salute and a
bugler played ``Taps'' as the late afternoon sun turned to gold the
winter landscape above the Uncompahgre River.
   Tabor enlisted July 5 and went to jump school at Fort Benning,
Georgia. His family last saw him in November when he came home on
leave and went elk hunting with his father, John, Sr., and one of
his two brothers.
   In South Carolina, Marine Cpl. Garreth C. Isaak, 22, was buried
in Greenville, shortly before Chief Warrant Officer Wilson B.
Owens, 29, was buried in Myrtle Beach.
   Owens died Dec. 20 when his two-man helicopter was shot down.
Having served in both the Navy and most recently the Army, he was
an aviator with B Company, 160th Aviation Battalion, based at Fort
Campbell, Ky.
   About 300 people attended his funeral, including about 20
members of his unit and representatives of the Charleston police,
Myrtle Beach Air Force Base and Brig. Gen. Dennis Leach of Fort
Jackson Army base in Columbia.
   A table by the coffin Friday held Owens' helmet, night vision
goggles and his beret.
   Lt. Col. John Binkley of Owens' unit presented two U.S. flags
used during the service to Owens' parents. And at the grave site at
Southeastern Memorial Gardens nearby, Owens was given a 21-gun
salute and two buglers played taps.
   Issak, based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., had been in Panama since
October and was scheduled to return to the United States in
January. Shot an hour after the invasion began, he died eight days
shy of his 23rd birthday.
   He joined the Marine Corps on May 25, 1985, a week after
graduating from high school. About 1,000 attended his funeral
service at Greenville's Hampton Park Baptist Church, followed by
burial at nearby Woodlawn Memorial Park.
   U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond called Isaak ``a brave Marine and a
great patriot who fought for his country, believed in freedom and
was willing to give his life for it.''
   In North Carolina, Pfc. Jerry Scott Daves, who was killed in the
early hours of the Panama invasion, was buried at the Fort Bragg
Cemetery, only miles from where he graduated from high school a
little more than a year ago.
   Daves, 20, of Hope Mills, an paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne
at Fort Bragg, was killed Wednesday in a clash with Panamanian
Defense Forces. His battalion attacked a small army post at
Tinajitas within hours of the invasion.
   A private memorial service was held at the base chapel before a
graveside ceremony at the base cemetery attended by some 300
people, including friends and relatives who chartered a bus from
Daves' childhood home in Catawba County.
   After a brief prayer by the Rev. Edward Orinson of Salisbury,
seven riflemen fired a 21-gun salute, and another serviceman played
``Taps.''
   As the service ended, a flag was presented to Daves' mother,
Sherry Henderson of Hickory, who held it briefly to her face and
wept. Another flag was given to Daves' father, Jerry W. Daves of
Hope Mills.
   Daves joined the Army on Aug. 4, 1988, shortly after graduating
from Southview High School in Hope Mills, which is only a few miles
from Fort Bragg. Friends said his dream throughout high school was
to be a soldier. In December of 1988, a day shy of a year before he
was killed, Daves was assigned to the 82nd Airborne.
   In Illinois, 19-year-old Army Pfc. Scott Lee Roth, was laid to
rest under rainy gray skies in the National Cemetery at the Rock
Island Arsenal.
   More than 40 servicemen attended the funeral, including Gary
Travis, Roth's commanding officer from Fort Hood, Texas.
   Roth's wife, Mary _ his high school sweetheart who enlisted with
him after graduation _ attended the service with her family and a
military escort.
   Roth had been stationed at Fort Hood with his wife since last
year. He had been in Panama since August with 124 military
policemen from the Texas base.
   Army 1st Lt. John Hunter, 30, who died Dec. 20, was eulogized in
a funeral service at Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and attended by an
honor guard from the Fort Huachuca Army base in southeastern
Arizona.
   Hunter, a native of Libby, Mont., was a helicopter pilot with
the 160th Special Operations Aviation Group stationed at Fort
Campbell, Ky.
   He enlisted as a private in December 1976 and later attended
Officer Candidate School and, most recently, the Embry Riddle
Aeronautical University. He had been a helicopter pilot for 8{
years.

<HEAD>Developer Picks Northern Nebraska For Nuclear Waste Dump</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A builder announced Friday the selection of a
site near this tiny community for a low-level nuclear waste dump
for Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.
   Opponents and a senator from neighboring South Dakota said they
would fight the selection, but others hailed the $40 million
project for the jobs and money it would bring to Boyd County in
northern Nebraska.
   The 320-acre site about two miles west of this community of
about 530 people and five miles from the South Dakota line was
chosen for its geology, said US Ecology Vice President Rich Paton.
   Gov. Kay Orr cautioned that it would be premature to conclude
that the site was acceptable until the licensing process is
completed.
   ``A license will not be issued unless US Ecology can convince us
that Nebraska's environment, and the health and safety of the
citizens of Boyd County will be protected,'' Mrs. Orr said.
   The application won't be made before July 1990, said US Ecology
spokesman Jim Neal.
   The reinforced, above-ground concrete vault system is expected
to begin operating in 1993 and to employ 25 to 30 people.
   It will have a 30-year lifespan and capacity for up to 5 million
cubic feet of radioactive waste, but officials estimate there will
be only 50,000 to 70,000 cubic feet, Neal said. The waste, gloves
and other radioactive garbage from nuclear power plants or
hospitals, will come from the five states.
   ``I don't think we have a whole lot of people who are afraid of
this thing,'' said Butte Mayor Ron Schroetlin.
   Schroetlin said the five-state waste compact commission had
promised $300,000 a year to the area chosen until the disposal site
is built and up to $2 million each year it is used.
   ``If that's used wisely it can help the whole county,'' he said.
   The site was one of three US Ecology was considering. The others
were in Nuckolls and Nemaha counties in southeast Nebraska.
   The 500 to 1,000 feet of impermeable shale bedrock beneath the
Boyd County site ``will provide a sound, natural barrier'' between
it and the Dakota Sandstone aquifer, Paton said said.
   US Ecology is developing the site for the Central Interstate
Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Commission. Member states voted
two years ago to make Nebraska the host state.
   In November 1988, Nebraska voters rejected an initiative
petition question to remove the state from the compact.
   Boyd County opponents had argued that their area contains
wetlands that should be protected, but Paton said US Ecology could
build without disturbing them.
   Harold Pierce, an area geologist who worked for the county
Low-Level Radioactive Waste Monitoring Committee, said US Ecology's
choice was a wise decision. ``There's not much question in my mind
that that's the best site, geologically and hydrologically,''
Pierce said.
   Actions over the years by local opponents included boycotting
businesses owned by supporters, and trying to recall a county
supervisor.
   Last month, a jury acquitted four Boyd County men accused of
confronting security guards at the gate of the proposed site, and
charges were dropped against a fifth.
   Schroetlin said things have calmed down. ``Maybe it will fire up
again,'' he said.
   U.S. Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., said he would ask the Army
Corps of Engineers and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review
the decision.
   ``I find it incredible that the state of Nebraska can determine
that a site that contains numerous federal wetlands would be
acceptable for a low-level nuclear waste site,'' the senator said.
   Lowell Fisher, head of the Save Boyd County anti-dump group,
said, ``We're going to do everything we can think of. We'll attack
it legally and every other way possible. I firmly believe it won't
be built here.''
   Boyd County's People for Progress, a group formed about a year
ago to support the waste site, welcomed US Ecology's choice.
   ``Now is the time for everyone to come together to work for the
good of our county,'' said Ken Reiser, the group's vice chairman.

   The government, making its annual forecast of

and construction firms will not fare as well.
   The Commerce Department assessed the prospects of 350 U.S.
industries for its 31st edition of the ``U.S. Industrial Outlook.''
   On the industrial side, it predicted that three-fourths of the
193 manufacturing firms it reviewed should enjoy rising shipments
next year while 18 percent will suffer declines and the rest will
have stagnant shipments.
   It predicted a median growth rate in manufacturing shipments of
2 percent next year, after removing the effects of inflation. That

   The news media shuttered by the

just days after the general's overthrow by U.S. forces.
   Even employees of those media that loyally followed a
pro-government line under Noriega are celebrating the installation
of the civilian government of President Guillermo Endara.
   The Noriega closed three opposition newspapers, three radio
stations and a television channel in 1988, shortly after the United
States began demanding the general's ouster. His regime
expropriated another TV station this year.
   In some cases, broadcast or publishing licenses were revoked,
equipment confiscated and offending reporters houned into exile.
The new government announced Thursday that all news media can

<HEAD>New Frederick Wiseman Film Focuses On Hard Questions Of Life, Death</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a new documentary about the end of
life in a hospital intensive care unit, patients are dying,
husbands and wives weep and doctors talk about God and ethics.
   Frederick Wiseman wept making ``Near Death,'' his 23rd
documentary. But he says he's cheered by the thought-provoking and
often surprising results.
   Intensive care takes on new meaning here, where the dying peer
into the abyss and discover a rare sense of belonging. Here
physicians and nurses display exquisite sensitivity as they guide
patients and their families to choose comfort over heroics.
   ``A lot of people want to live in a community where people are
tuned in to each other and care for each other and listen to each
other,'' Wiseman said in an interview at his film studio here.
``For most of us, that doesn't happen.''
   In daily life, said Wiseman, ``we also have to deal with
banality and cruelty and indifference. A lot of these things are
filtered out in the intensive care unit.''
   Shot in black and white at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston and
nearly six hours long, the film scheduled to be broadcast on PBS
stations this month uses Wiseman's trademark fly-on-the-wall
technique.
   No narrator or talking heads intrude to explain things. It's
just a camera and a microphone watching and listening in as
families and the fatally ill reckon with death.
   In a hospital, however, death is a complicated business.
Technology sticks a wedge in the door to life. Machines and
powerful medicines allow us to gamble on one more day, one more
kiss goodbye, one more week or month or more in the land of the
living.
   While the notion of choosing when and how to die is eerie, it is
part of the modern way of death. Slightly more than half the deaths
in 1986, the last year for which such figures are available,
occurred in hospitals, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics.
   Wiseman's intention in making the film was to stimulate
discussion of what many of us and our relations may someday
encounter _ ``to show in some detail the kind of decisions people
have to make.''
   ``Near Death'' keeps the viewer in emotional suspense. What is
most riveting is the candor. This is no place to tip-toe with the
truth.
   ``If he breathes, he breathes. If he doesn't, it's in God's
hands,'' a doctor tells a patient's son.
   A nurse explains to an 83-year-old man: ``You're not going to
get better. It's sad and it's frustrating and it's anger-provoking.
But you're not going to get better.''
   The man smiles sadly. He listens. She continues, ``I want to
help you ... (but) I don't want to keep you alive unless you like
living. We're telling you what we know about your body and asking
you to make a decision ...''
   The man tells her wants to see his children.
   A wife cries to a husband slipping from her with every breath:
``He's my life. He's my life.''
   This is not the place to go gently into that good night.
Ghastly, ghostly lights shine to keep the dark out. Translucent
tubes gurgle. Electronic monitors hum and shoot across their
screens jagged, fragile traces: lifelines.
   Patients lie shrouded in their beds and stay tethered to the
life-saving machines. Sometimes the only sign of the tenacity of
life is a wiggle of a toe, a squeeze of the hand, a blink.
   Wiseman trained his camera on four people, two elderly men with
heart disease, a 33-year-old man whose chemotherapy for testicular
cancer turned his lungs to the density of cork, and an elderly
woman with severe difficulty breathing on her own.
   These patients, their spouses and their children agreed to have
their most intimate and painful moments filmed to give to others
what they would have liked for themselves, Wiseman said: the chance
to preview the ambiguities and uncertainties of the life-and-death
questions.
   But the patients and their kin are not alone in their suffering.
   A doctor named Scott is reassuring to patients and kind to their
families. But to his colleagues he talks often about his doubts _
and theirs.
   ``I'm quite nihilistic about what happens,'' he tells one
doctor. ``A lot of this stuff is not really relevant to making
quality of life all that much better. It's really rolling the rock
up the hill and having it come back down again. That's what a lot
of this is.''
   But he says later, ``God decides. We don't decide. These things
have a life of their own.''

<HEAD>`Operation Roadblock': National Effort to Rid Truck Stops of Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CORDELE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Mel Boggs parks his 18-wheeler at a
truck stop he expects good food, clean showers and a safe parking
lot, free of hucksters, prostitutes and drug dealers.
   ``Get the drugs, alcohol and paid women off the lots and let the
men get the proper rest,'' the 54-year-old Boggs said during a fuel
stop at the Perlis Truck Stop in Cordele. ``If a man's got the
proper rest, he's going to be a safer driver.''
   Boggs, a burly plain-spoken man with 20 years of long-haul
experience, said truckers sometimes are disturbed while parked at
truck stops and rest areas by people selling sex, drugs, jewelry
and other merchandise.
   ``When I'm ready to stop and rest, I don't want people beating
on my doors,'' said the Jamestown, Ohio, driver.
   The truck stop industry, responding to President Bush's call for
a major drug offensive, has launched a nationwide campaign known as
``Operation Roadblock'' to transform truck stops into drug-free
zones. Owners are considering the use of drug-sniffing dogs, sting
operations, counseling programs and random drug tests for truck
stop employees.
   Roger A. King, spokesman for the National Association of Truck
Stop Operators, estimates 3 to 5 percent of the nation's 1 million
commercial drivers either sell or use drugs.
   ``The vast majority of drivers are small businessmen who can't
afford to lose their livelihood because of drugs,'' he said.
   Trucker Denny Austin, 36, of Calhoun, Ky., said he welcomed the
campaign and hopes it cuts down on the number of impaired drivers.
   Austin said truckers can't afford to have muddled brains because
they have to respond quickly to changing highway situations. The
stopping distance for an 80,000-pound rig is five times greater
than for a car.
   ``Drugs can turn a real smart person into a dummy,'' Austin
noted while eating breakfast in the Perlis restaurant.
   Owner Lamar Perlis proposed the truck stop campaign during a
recent NATSO meeting in New York.
   Perlis, a member of NATSO's steering committee, said the
association will evaluate the anti-drug efforts of individual
operators and will consult with the White House staff, the FBI and
drug czar William Bennett before developing specific
recommendations for its members.
   He said NATSO's 1,050 truck stop members and 220 allied members
have been asked to contribute $250,000 to fund the program.
   ``We are aware that drugs have infiltrated every segment of our
society, including the trucking industry and the truck stop
industry and we are trying to mobilize,'' he added.
   Several truck stops already are using drug dogs, one is spending
$7,000 a month for security lighting, others have installed fences
around their lots and many have hired security guards to protect
drivers, rigs and loads, King said.
   The All-American Truck Stop in Carlisle, Pa., has posted signs
warning would-be dealers that they may get caught in sting
operations supervised by the district attorney.
   The New England Truck Stop in Sturbridge, Mass., includes notes
with paychecks, offering help for employees with drug problems,
King said in an interview from NATSO's Alexandria, Va.,
headquarters.
   NATSO and the American Trucking Association have endorsed a U.S.
Senate bill that would authorize strong penalties for selling drugs
within 1,000 feet of truck stops. Congress has passed similar
legislation to protect schools and playgrounds.
   U.S. Rep. Bob Clement, D-Tenn., has sponsored a bill known as
the Drug-Free Truck Stop Act of 1989 that also would designate
truck stops as drug-free zones. Violators would be subject to
maximum sentences of 10 years for selling drugs within 1,000 feet
of truck stops.
   ``This bill targets all people, whether they are commercial
drivers or not, who ply their onerous trade in areas where trucks
congregate,'' said NATSO President William Clower. ``Congressional
action in this area will strengthen our efforts to make America's
highways safer.''
   Perlis believes most drivers will welcome Operation Roadblock.
``They want safe havens just as anyone else,'' he said.
   His truck stop has a security guard six nights a week, its
employees monitor CB radio channels for signs of drug activity, and
the sheriff assists when needed.
   The Perlis Truck Stop is one of the most popular along heavily
traveled Interstate 75, a major route between Florida and the
Midwest. The 14-acre facility has a large restaurant, showers, a
garage, a store, video games, refueling bays for trucks and cars
and a small motel. It serves up to 2,400 trucks a day.
   ``Truckers are basically like you and me,'' said General Manager
Leon Perlis, the owner's son. ``They're family people trying to
make a living. The guy who gets the exposure _ the guy who gets
caught with drugs or the guy who runs over someone _ is the
exception, not the rule.''

   Texans strode into Washington last January
confident the Lone Star was in ascendancy _ laying claim to the
White House, the House speakership and a passel of Cabinet posts
and congressional committee chairmanships.
   They begin the new year with their influence on the Bush
administration undiminished, but their clout in Congress has been
decimated by death, illness, a retirement and the resignation of
their most powerful member.
   Rep. Michael Andrews, a Houston Democrat, says Texas is coming
off a ``windshift year.''
   Some Texans fear their legendary clout _ which they predicted
was waxing at the start of 1989 _ has waned so much that the state
is now at a disadvantage in fighting for the government largesse
that has traditionally come their way.
   Early on, the Senate refused to confirm President Bush's choice
of John Tower as secretary of defense after exploring allegations
of womanizing and excessive drinking by the former Texas senator.
   Three months later, in June, House Speaker Jim Wright abandoned
a 34-year career in the House and resigned from the most
influential position in Congress amid an ethics investigation of
his personal finances.
   In August, Rep. Mickey Leland of Houston was killed when his
bush plane slammed into a remote mountain in Ethiopia on its way to
a refugee camp.
   In October, after suffering abdominal pains, Rep. Jack Brooks,
dean of the Texas congressional delegation, was hospitalized for
six weeks for an inflammation of the pancreas.
   And on Dec. 1, Rep. Marvin Leath, an influential Democrat on the
House Budget and Armed Services committees, announced he would not
seek a seventh term in 1990.
   Despite the setbacks, the Texas delegation still landed $225
million to begin building the superconducting super collider, a
giant particle accelerator that scientists hope will help them
understand the origins of the universe, and fended of a potential
attempt to cut $100 million in Pentagon funding for Sematech, a
national semiconductor research consortium in Austin.
   Texas also saw the Pentagon chose Dyess Air Force Base as a site
for rail-based MX missiles _ a project that supportors say
guarantees the Abilene installation a mission into the next century
even as budget cutters slash military spending.
   But they still face a tough fight to maintain research and
development funds for another military project being built in Texas
_ the V-22 Osprey aircraft _ and they failed to obtain tax breaks
for the state's troubled oil and gas industry.
   Rep. John Bryant, a Dallas Democrat, says he's afraid the
delegation's weakened presence in Washington leaves it vulnerable
to new attacks this year by other members of Congress who believe
Texas has long gotten more than its fair share from the federal
government.
   Bryant, who in April announced he was a candidate for state
attorney general, decided in December to pull out of the race and
stay in Washington, where he can keep an eye on next year's budget
as a member of the House Budget Committee.
   He says the super collider, Sematech and the space station,
being built in Houston, all may be under seige in 1990.
   When Congress reconvenes later this month, he says, it will do
so ``for the first time in modern history without a Texas member in
a key position to protect our state's interests in the budget
process.''
   Still, Texas is hardly without well-positioned members of
Congress.
   Its senior senator, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, is chairman of the
Finance Committee. In the House, Brooks heads the Judiciary
Committee, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez is chairman of the Banking,
Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, and Rep. Kika de la Garza is
chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
   ``We still have a lot of power there,'' says Bentsen, the 1988
Democratic vice presidential candidate and a potential presidential
candidate in 1992.
   Bentsen's fellow senator from Texas, Republican Phil Gramm, puts
it this way:
   ``Before all this happened, Texas had the greatest degree of
influence in Washington of any state in the union. Texas still has
the most influence of any state in the union.''

   Screenwriter Dennis Turner at first turned
down an offer to write the screen biography of Rock Hudson because
he had also led a double life.
   ``I said no a few times, but they kept coming back,'' Turner
said. `I'm glad they did. I said no because I didn't know how
seriously they wanted to treat his homosexuality. I didn't want to
do a travelogue of his life, nor did I want to do an exploitation
story because it was too close to my own life.
   ``I didn't want it to be like the `Liberace' movies where they
didn't adequately acknowledge his homosexuality. If you're going to
do a Rock Hudson movie it didn't make sense to me not to go into
all the corners.
   ``I was persuaded when ABC and the producers agreed it would be
a serious study. I knew it was going to be done and felt as a gay
man who had shared a lot of experiences that it should be done by
someone who would understand what was going on.''
   Actor Rock Hudson was one of Hollywood's most handsome and
virile screen lovers whose secret life as a homosexual became
public knowledge when he became stricken with AIDS. His death in
October 1985 helped create an awareness of the disease.
   The two-hour ``Rock Hudson'' will be telecast on ABC next
Monday. It stars Thomas Ian Griffith as Hudson; Daphne Ashbrook as
Phyllis Gates, his former wife; William R. Moses as Marc Christian,
his companion, who later successfully sued the estate; and Diane
Ladd as his mother.
   Andrew Robinson, who played Liberace in one film version, is
Henry Willson, the agent who changed Roy Fitzgerald's name to Rock
Hudson.
   NBC also has a Rock Hudson project in the works, based on ``Rock
Hudson: His Story,'' which Sara Davidson wrote in cooperation with
Hudson and his estate. The movie is currently in development with
no announced plans for production.
   Turner said he felt his own background would help him bring an
understanding to the story. ``I had been married and had
children,'' he said. ``I'm a recovering alcoholic and he was an
alcoholic who did not recover. We're both gay. We're both products
of the 1950s, although he was older, and we both suffered in that
secretive environment.
   ``You felt you were the only person on the planet who was gay.
The thought of being excluded was frightening. Rock's secrets were
eating away at him and they ultimately killed him. He would not
reveal his personal life, even to his closest friends. I think the
fact that he couldn't be truthful contributed to his drinking. The
alcohol in turn contributed to his promiscuity. He was incapable of
having a long-term relationship with anybody. I don't think he was
living the kind of life he wanted. It destroyed him.''
   Turner said he interviewed Phyllis Gates, Marc Christian and
others who knew Hudson. The screenplay is also partially based on
Gates' book, ``My Husband Rock Hudson.''
   ``The story takes him from 21 to 58,'' he said. ``It begins in
1948 when he got his first job in a movie. He had one line in
`Fighter Squadron,' which starred Edmond O'Brien and Robert Stack.
   ``His homosexuality had already manifested itself by then,''
said Turner. ``I think he and Phyllis loved each other. They had a
romantic relationship before they married. Rock wanted to be
straight, he wanted to have a family. He gave it his best shot.
   ``I want this movie to show the complexities of a man who
happened to be gay and a human being. I'm tired of the media, and I
guess the everyday population, treating gays or any minority as a
stereotype, a joke or a walking disease. I wanted to show that
keeping secrets, not being able to be honest or choosing not to be
honest, is destructive to everyone.''
   A former New York playwright, Turner previously has written such
film projects as ``Poor Little Rich Girl,'' ``The Long Hot
Summer,'' and ``Between the Darkness and the Dawn.'' He's also a
former staff writer for ``Dynasty,'' where he met Hudson when he
was on the show in the 1984-85 season.

   Drug Enforcement Administrator John C. Lawn
generally keeps a low profile. He speaks in a quiet, husky voice as
he guides the actions of agents throughout the world, trying to
keep them safe in the field and supported in Washington.
   But when a miniseries on the 1985 murder in Mexico of DEA Agent
Enrique ``Kiki'' Camerena airs on NBC-TV in January, he could
become something of a national hero.
   The television movie depicts Lawn tangling with Mexican
officials who stonewall efforts to find Camarena and his killers,
and going public to criticize those officials over the objections
of Reagan administration officials.
   At the conclusion of a National Archives screening, a choked-up
Lawn told the audience of about 100 DEA and Mexican Embassy
officials that it was ``an extraordinary piece of work.''
   The miniseries is based on the book ``Desperados'' by Elaine
Shannon and tells the story of Lawn and Camarena, who was kidnapped
Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara.
   A Mexican pilot who had worked with DEA agents there, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar, was kidnapped a few days later. The bullet-riddled
bodies of the two men, showing signs of torture, were found March
5, 1985, wrapped in plastic bags and dumped on a ranch 60 miles
southeast of Guadalajara.
   Lawn was the DEA's deputy administrator when Camarena
disappeared. By the time the agent's body was found, Lawn was
administrator. It was his first crisis.
   DEA Deputy Administrator Terrence Burke called the film
``powerful,'' but operations director David Westrate said ``there's
a lot of pretend in there.'' Lawn said privately the miniseries was
``about 80 percent accurate,'' which he considered commendable for
television.
   The Mexican Embassy minister for narcotics affairs, Gustavo
Gonzalez Baez _ appointed by the new administration in Mexico that
has cracked down on drug traffickers and corrupt officials _ said
Americans ``are accustomed to seeing this kind of series and they
realize this is not reality, this is just amusement.''
   The movie, he said, suggests ``that all the Mexican authorities
were involved in protecting drug traffickers, and that is
absolutely inaccurate.''
   Gonzalez Baez noted that drug traffickers Rafael Caro Quintero
and Ernesto Rafael Fonseca Carrillo, along with several Mexican
judicial police officers, have been convicted and sentenced to long
terms in connection with the murders.
   Although the miniseries is generally grim, the National Archives
audience found some humor when suddenly, up on the screen in living
color, was William von Raab, the former U.S. Customs Commissioner,
playing himself as he vowed to shut down the U.S.-Mexican border
with car-by-car searches to put pressure on Mexican officials. The
audience's disbelief at seeing von Raab on the screen began with a
murmur and grew into surprised laughter, drowning out von Raab's
lines.
   Lawn, a 54-year-old ex-Marine who goes by the name ``Jack,''
seems somewhat abashed at being, in the words of one observer,
``canonized on television.''
   It may be because the subject matter is so difficult.
   In an interview before the screening, Lawn said the loss of any
of his 2,900 agents is the toughest part of his job.
   ``When you talk to families, the first question I have gotten
from each of the families _ the nine recent funerals that I have
presided over _ the question has always been, `Is what he did
important? Will it make a difference?'''
   It started with Camarena's wife, Mika.
   ``Her initial response was, `Please assure me that Kiki will not
just become a number. It has to mean more than that.'''
   In Camarena's case, it has meant more, in large part because the
DEA was determined to uncover who was responsible.
   ``Many individuals in the international community have said,
`The Mexican government has lost hundreds of people. The Colombian
government has lost hundreds of people. Why pursue Camarena?'''
Lawn recalled.
   To Lawn, Camarena ``was a symbol (that) we in the law
enforcement community, domestic and international, depend upon one
another.''
   ``Kiki depended upon law enforcement counterparts in Mexico who
failed that trust,'' Lawn said. ``And that's the reason we had to
pursue it with vigilance.''
   Lawn won't say how many more agents he'd like to have, but he
contrasts the $8.8 billion drug war budget for 1990 to the ``excess
of $30 billion a year'' the United States spent for the Vietnam War.
   ``To have fewer agents than there are musicians in the United
States Army, or to have fewer agents than there are New York City
Transit Police or female officers in the New York City Police
Department, you get a sense of too few people being asked to face a
Herculean challenge,'' Lawn said.
   But he doesn't believe the U.S. drug crisis will change without
a far greater emphasis on education to reduce demand.
   Even if his force were doubled, ``Twice as good a job is still
not good enough, because without a balance on the other side,
without demand reduction, without international cooperation, our
victory's a Pyrrhic victory,'' he said.
   The miniseries, ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' starring
Steven Bauer, Elizabeth Pena, Treat Williams, Miguel Ferrer and
Craig T. Nelson, is to air Jan. 7, 8 and 9 on NBC-TV.

<HEAD>Top Drug Agent's Story Told in TV Miniseries</HEAD>

   Drug Enforcement Administrator John C. Lawn
generally keeps a low profile. He speaks in a quiet, husky voice as
he guides the actions of agents throughout the world, trying to
keep them safe in the field and supported in Washington.
   But when a miniseries on the 1985 murder in Mexico of DEA Agent
Enrique ``Kiki'' Camerena airs on NBC-TV in January, he could
become something of a national hero.
   The television movie depicts Lawn tangling with Mexican
officials who stonewall efforts to find Camarena and his killers,
and going public to criticize those officials over the objections
of Reagan administration officials.
   At the conclusion of a National Archives screening, a choked-up
Lawn told the audience of about 100 DEA and Mexican Embassy
officials that it was ``an extraordinary piece of work.''
   The miniseries is based on the book ``Desperados'' by Elaine
Shannon and tells the story of Lawn and Camarena, who was kidnapped
Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara.
   A Mexican pilot who had worked with DEA agents there, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar, was kidnapped a few days later. Their bullet-riddled
bodies, showing signs of torture, were found March 5, 1985, wrapped
in plastic bags and dumped on a ranch 60 miles southeast of
Guadalajara.
   Lawn was DEA's deputy administrator when Camarena disappeared.
By the time the agent's body was found, Lawn was administrator. It
was his first crisis.
   DEA Deputy Administrator Terrence Burke called the film
``powerful,'' but operations director David Westrate said ``there's
a lot of pretend in there.'' Lawn said privately that the
miniseries is ``about 80 percent accurate,'' which he considered
commendable for television.
   The Mexican Embassy minister for narcotics affairs, Gustavo
Gonzalez Baez _ appointed by the new administration in Mexico that
has cracked down on drug traffickers and corrupt officials _ said
Americans ``are accustomed to seeing this kind of series and they
realize this is not reality, this is just amusement.''
   The movie, he said, suggests ``that all the Mexican authorities
were involved in protecting drug traffickers, and that is
absolutely inaccurate.''
   Gonzalez Baez noted that drug traffickers Rafael Caro Quintero
and Ernesto Rafael Fonseca Carrillo, along with several Mexican
judicial police officers, have been convicted and sentenced to long
terms in connection with the murders.
   Although the miniseries is generally grim, the National Archives
audience found some humor when suddenly, up on the screen in living
color, was William von Raab, the former U.S. Customs Commissioner,
playing himself as he vowed to shut down the U.S.-Mexican border
with car-by-car searches to put pressure on Mexican officials. The
audience's disbelief at seeing von Raab on the screen began with a
murmur and grew into surprised laughter, drowning out von Raab's
lines.
   Lawn, a 54-year-old ex-Marine who goes by the name ``Jack,''
seems somewhat abashed at being, in the words of one observer,
``canonized on television.''
   It may be because the subject matter is so difficult.
   In an interview before the National Archives screening, Lawn
said the loss of any of his 2,900 agents is the toughest part of
his job.
   ``When you talk to families, the first question I have gotten
from each of the families _ the nine recent funerals that I have
presided over _ the question has always been, `Is what he did
important? Will it make a difference?'''
   It started with Camarena's wife, Mika.
   ``Her initial response was, `Please assure me that Kiki will not
just become a number. It has to mean more than that.'''
   In Camarena's case, it has meant more, in large part because the
DEA was determined to uncover who was responsible.
   ``Many individuals in the international community have said,
`The Mexican government has lost hundreds of people. The Colombian
government has lost hundreds of people. Why pursue Camarena?'''
Lawn recalled.
   To Lawn, Camarena ``was a symbol (that) we in the law
enforcement community, domestic and international, depend upon one
another.''
   ``Kiki depended upon law enforcement counterparts in Mexico who
failed that trust,'' Lawn said. ``And that's the reason we had to
pursue it with vigilance.''
   Lawn won't say how many more agents he'd like to have, but he
contrasts the $8.8 billion drug war budget for 1990 to the ``excess
of $30 billion a year'' the United States spent for the Vietnam War.
   ``To have fewer agents than there are musicians in the United
States Army, or to have fewer agents than there are New York City
Transit Police or female officers in the New York City Police
Department, you get a sense of too few people being asked to face a
Herculean challenge,'' Lawn said.
   But he doesn't believe the U.S. drug crisis will change without
a far greater emphasis on education to reduce demand.
   Even if his force were doubled, ``Twice as good a job is still
not good enough, because without a balance on the other side,
without demand reduction, without international cooperation, our
victory's a Pyrrhic victory,'' he said.
   The miniseries, ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' starring
Steven Bauer, Elizabeth Pena, Treat Williams, Miguel Ferrer and
Craig T. Nelson, is to air Jan. 7, 8 and 9 on NBC-TV.

   Their many different worlds seldom intersected _ the worlds of
music and baseball, of letters and law, of the surreal and the
slapstick, of political struggle and science, of spies and
prizefights and quiet poetry.

   The wind blew and the earth shook. And the wall came down.
   There it is: 1989 in review. A year of disasters that rivaled
Old Testament plagues, of triumphs that challenged credulity _ a
year that led people, again and again, to the same words: ``I never
thought I'd see the day.''
   For a while, it seemed that this would be the Year of the Oil
Spill. Then the Year of the Hurricane. Then the Year of the
Earthquake.
   But the last turbulent year of the decade will be remembered,
finally, as the year the Iron Curtain lifted.
   Twenty-six years earlier, John F. Kennedy had stood before the
Berlin Wall and said of free citizens everywhere: ``Let them come
to Berlin.'' In 1989, they came _ and from the least imaginable
direction. They came from the East.
   ``What joy!'' a West Berliner exclaimed; and people from East
and West Berlin danced and laughed and hugged atop a wall that no
longer divided them.
   ``We live in exciting times,'' President Bush observed. ``The
rapidity of change is mind-boggling.''
   Indeed it was.
   In Poland, the Solidarity trade union was illegal at the
beginning of the year; it had ousted the Communist government by
the end. Then came Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia: One by
one, Eastern Europe's ruling Communist parties followed Poland's
lead and agreed to step aside and allow democratic, multi-party
elections.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had loosed the shackles
that once bound Eastern Europe. And after a seasick summit with
Bush in the tempestuous Mediterranean, he declared that the Cold
War was over.
   Even Romania, among the most stalwart of the old-line Communist
states, was overwhelmed by democratic fervor that drove President
Nicolae Ceausescu from his palace and ultimately to his death
before a firing squad.
   Images of Eastern Europe's peaceful revolution will stick in the
memory for a long time, but so will a sadder picture: a lone man
standing before a phalanx of tanks near Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   It had been a hopeful spring in the square, where tens of
thousands of students demonstrated daily to demand democratic
change. Military officers at first balked at suppressing the
protesters _ 100 officers signed a statement saying the army ``will
never shoot the people.'' But, on June 3, the army began shooting
the people.
   The death toll may never be known. Estimates ranged from 300 to
3,000.
   Brute force blocked democracy in China, but U.S. troops
forcefully imposed it in Panama, where an invasion just before
Christmas ousted the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
and installed an elected president.
   On a smaller scale, too, it was a year of tumultuous transition.
   The TV lights went out for televangelist Jim Bakker, who got a
45-year prison term for conspiracy and fraud.
   Zsa Zsa Gabor finally starred in a film that everyone remembers
_ her trial on cop-slapping charges. She played Beverly Hills'
official court jester, and was rewarded with a conviction and jail
term.
   Leona Helmsley was the queen of a hotel empire, but she was
mocked and reviled outside her kingdom and was sentenced to four
years in prison for tax evasion.
   Pete Rose became as closely linked with betting as batting, and
agreed to a lifetime suspension from the game to which he'd devoted
his life.
   John Tower, President Bush's choice as secretary of defense,
lost the nomination and a sizable chunk of his reputation when he
was pilloried as a liquor-tippling ``party animal.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright resigned in a furor over outside
income; Tom Foley took his place.
   Time merged with Warner. Sony merged with Columbia. Mike Tyson
split with Robin Givens.
   The year's obituaries noted the passing of both famous and
infamous:
   Irving Berlin and Bette Davis, Lucille Ball, Robert Penn Warren,
Salvador Dali, Vladimir Horowitz, Herbert von Karajan, Laurence
Olivier, Mel Blanc.
   Ferdinand Marcos, Ayatollah Khomeini, Emperor Hirohito. Abbie
Hoffman. Rep. Claude Pepper.
   Sugar Ray Robinson, A. Bartlett Giamatti. Secretariat.
   Mass murderer Ted Bundy was put to death; other killers died at
their own hands. They included Patrick Purdy, who killed five
schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif.; Joseph Wesbecker, who killed
eight people in a printing plant in Louisville, Ky.; and Marc
Lepine, who systematically gunned down 14 female engineering
students in Montreal.
   Ramon Salcido allegedly killed his wife, two daughters, and four
other people near Santa Rosa, Calif., before fleeing to Mexico. He
was captured five days later and awaits trial in California.
   More than 20,000 Americans died of AIDS. Scientists continued
searching for a vaccine and a cure, and the government tried to
find new ways to make experimental drugs available more quickly.
   People worried about homelessness and hunger, abortion and child
care, flag-burning and the ``greenhouse effect.''
   The most-honored movie of the year _ ``Rain Man'' _ suggested
that the ``Me Decade'' ethic might be softening. It was the story
of a fast-talking wheeler-dealer from Southern California who found
some measure of humanity in caring for his autistic brother.
   Then again, the Grammy Award for best song went to Bobby
McFerrin's ``Don't Worry, Be Happy.''
   Historically speaking, the year began on a chilly, cloudy day in
January when George Bush took the oath of office as the 41st
president of the United States.
   ``A new breeze is blowing,'' he declared in his inaugural
address, ``and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push
on: There is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken.''
   If presidencies are defined by symbols and styles, Bush set out
to cast his as open, informal, active _ sort of an aerobic Teddy
Roosevelt. He opened the White House to the public the day after
his inauguration; he met with the press far more frequently than
did President Reagan; and he seemed at times to be cultivating an
image as the Triathlete President _ jogging, golfing, fishing,
speedboating, playing tennis, tossing horseshoes, tussling with
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Swink Shutdown Caused No Customer Losses, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No customer losses have been incurred
with the closing of Swink &amp; Co., a Little Rock bond company that
cited heavy trading losses for the shutdown, the company's attorney
says.
   The closing is due to ``unrealized losses because of market
value decline in government securities,'' Jim Dale Swink, the
firm's chairman and principal owner, said in a letter to state
securities regulators.
   Patrick R. James, Swink's general counsel, said in announcing
the closing Wednesday that the company was in the process of
self-liquidation.
   ``At this point, it appears there are no customer losses,''
James said. ``We notified the National Association of Securities
Dealers and the Arkansas Securities Department of these events.
Other than that, I have no comment.''
   All of Swink's half-dozen offices will close and about 100
workers will be out of work, James said. As of Wednesday, the firm
operated offices in Atlanta; Albuquerque, N.M.; Boca Raton, Fla.;
and other cities in Florida, he said. However, most of the workers
were in Swink's Little Rock office.
   State Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett said the firm
likely has some small investors as clients, although much of the
bond house's business has been in underwriting municipal bond
issues. Swink sold bonds mainly to institutional buyers.
   Investors likely are protected because the Securities Investment
Protection Corp. insures Swink's accounts up to $100,000 in cash
and $500,000 in securities, Ms. Bassett said.
   She said she expected the securities dealers association to send
a representative from New Orleans to supervise Swink's liquidation.
   ``Basically, what our office will want to do is get with the
NASD to make sure somebody monitors to be sure customers are
covered'' by Swink funds or the insurance pool, Ms. Bassett said.
``We will also want to see if any state laws have been violated.''
   Swink has been plagued by run-ins with regulators and investors'
lawsuits since it opened in 1971 as Swink &amp; Brittenum Inc. By 1975,
the firm had split into two companies, Swink &amp; Co. and Jon R.
Brittenum &amp; Associates, run by the former University of Arkansas
quarterback.
   In 1986, Brittenum's firm failed, and he received a five-year
suspended prison sentence this year after pleading guilty to theft
by deception charges. He was ordered to perform 100 hours of
community service and ordered to pay what reportedly could turn out
to be millions of dollars in restitution.
   Swink's fortunes dipped more in recent years with the decline of
the bond market and government cutbacks on municipal bonding
authorities. Also, more Swink underwritings went sour.

<HEAD>McDonald's Franchises, Recycler File Suit Against Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB BAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plastics recycler and five companies
that own McDonald's franchises have gone to court to challenge the
city of Portland's ban on polystyrene foam products used in
restaurants and other food vending operations.
   Polystyrene, generally known under the brand name Styrofoam, is
widely used to package food and drinks in fast-food outlets.
   Mark Cushing, the plaintiffs' attorney, said the lawsuit
contends the ban, scheduled to take effect Monday, violates
Oregon's Solid Waste Control and Opportunity to Recycle Act as well
as the state and federal constitutions.
   ``In a nutshell, we contend that the city has no legal authority
to ban a recyclable product,'' Cushing said.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Multnomah County Circuit Court,
seeks an injunction preventing any enforcement of the ban.
   City Attorney Jeffrey Rogers declined to comment on the merits
of the lawsuit, but said the city was prepared to defend the
ordinance.
   Although the ban takes effect on Monday, Rogers said the
ordinance won't be enforced until a judge rules on the request for
an injunction sometime in mid-January.
   Under terms of the ordinance, the city serves a written notice
when it receives a complaint from a citizen or a report from a
health inspector that a business is violating the ban. The city
must wait at least 20 days after the notice is received before
sending inspectors to the business to see if the foam ban still is
being ignored.
   If the ban is being violated, the business is subject to a $250
fine on the first offense and a $500 fine on subsequent offenses.
   The lawsuit was filed by Denton Plastics, a major plastics
recycler based in Portland, and five companies that own most of the
14 McDonald's franchises in the city. Also joining as plaintiffs
were Gerald Herman, described by Rogers as a ``longtime recycling
activist'' and two other companies _ Gage Industries, a Portland
plastics recycler, and Irwin Research and Development, a Yakima,
Wash., company that manufactures recycling equipment.
   ``I expect the number of plaintiffs to grow because already
calls are coming in from delicatessens and small restaurants
wanting to be a part of the activity,'' Cushing said.
   The City Council first passed the ordinance in November 1988 and
adopted it officially last January. On Dec. 13, the council voted
4-1 to table a proposal by Commissioner Bob Koch to require
recycling of the material rather than banning it.
   Barbara George, assistant to City Commissioner Earl Blumenauer,
said the council felt that although the industry has quit using
chlorofluorocarbons in the manufacture of polystyrene, ``they still
are using gases to blow air into the product and some of those are
still destroying the ozone layer.''
   Chlorofluorocarbons, which damage the earth's ozone layer, have
not been used in the manufacture of polystyrene for about three
years, Cushing said.
   The council also was concerned that the foam products weren't
biodegradable and would be difficult to recycle because of how
light they are, George said. The ban does not apply to packing
material or to polystyrene used in schools, hospitals and other
nonprofit institutions.
   ``I'm just surprised and sort of disappointed that it happened
three days before the implementation date,'' George said. ``The
council approved this a long time ago so people have had fair
warning. I know a lot of restaurants either were complying already
last year or have since complied with the council policy.''
   He also said the coated paper product that would replace
polystyrene is not recyclable and is two to three times as
expensive as polystyrene.
   The ban would affect 2,200 businesses in Portland, including
1,700 restaurants and 500 grocery stores with prepared food
operations.
   George said whether the replacement products are no less
biodegradable than polystyrene is open to debate.

   The government's main forecasting gauge of
economic activity edged up a modest 0.1 percent last month, the
Commerce Department said today in a report that analysts took as a
sign the economy will slow in 1990 but not topple into a recession.
   The small rise in the department's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators for November followed a revised 0.3 percent decline in
October.
   In all, the index, which is designed to forecast economic
activity six to nine months in the future, has exhibited a sawtooth
pattern this year, rising in six of the past 11 months and falling
in the other five months.
   Through November, the index was down by 0.3 percent for the
year, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent for all of 1988.
   To economists, this provided evidence that economic activity in
1990 will be more sluggish than in 1989.
   Many analysts are predicting that the economy, as measured by
the gross national product, will expand at a modest annual rate of
2 percent or less in 1990, compared with expected growth of 3
percent this year.
   However, analysts generally expect the economy will be able to
escape a recession. That belief based in part on the fact that the
leading index has not yet declined for three consecutive months,
the traditional _ though not infallible _ sign of a downturn.
   The 0.1 percent rise in November, which was right in line with
expectations, was led by a strong jump in orders for consumer
goods. The other four indicators providing strength were a drop in
weekly unemployment claims, an increase in plant and equipment
orders, a rise in the money supply and an increase in the backlog
of manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   Six other indicators acted as a drag on the index last month,
with the biggest negative coming from a drop in the price of raw
materials. While such a decrease is considered good news for
inflation prospects, it is counted as a negative in the index
because it also can reflect declining demand.
   Other negative factors were a decline in stock prices, a drop in
consumer confidence, a decline in the average manufacturing work
week, a decline in building permits and a speedup in business
delivery times.
   The various changes left the index at 144.7 percent of its 1982
base of 100.
   The gross national product grew at an annual rate of 3 percent
in the July-September quarter, but economists believe the growth
rate slowed dramatically in the current October-December quarter.
   Frank McCormick, senior economist at the Bank of America in San
Francisco, said the GNP probably expanded at an annual rate of just
1.2 percent in the fourth quarter. The government will not release
its own estimate of this growth rate until next month.
   Some analysts are even more pessimistic, fearing that the GNP
may not have expanded at all and instead registered a small
negative number. The most pessimistic say the economy may suffer a
small recession with negative growth in both the fourth quarter and
the first quarter of next year.
   But McCormick discounted this minority view, contending that the
Fed's easing efforts have come in time to keep alive the expansion
following the 1981-82 recession, a recovery which already has
lasted a peacetime record of seven years.
   ``We think we have gone through the slowest growth already this
quarter and the economy will be gradually picking up through next
year,'' he said.
   That forecast would be good news for the Bush administration,
which is counting on continued growth to boost government revenues
and help reduce the federal deficit without a tax increase.

<TEXT>
   Sock Shop International PLC, the high-flying
British retailer that mainly sells socks, said Friday it has
temporarily closed its 17 U.S. stores.
   The company closed the shops on Wednesday to negotiate new
leases with landlords to lower rents. It also is negotiating with a
prospective partner, said Peter Moss, a company director. He
declined to identify the possible partner.
   Fourteen of the shops are in New York City, two are in New
Jersey and one is in Philadelphia.
   Asked when the stores would be reopened, he said: ``Hopefully,
if negotiations proceed well, in the next couple of weeks, or else
there will be a further announcement in the next week or two.''
   Moss said Sock Shop's sales have suffered in the United States.
   ``It's been a disappointing trading period,'' he said. ``No I
can't put any figure on it at this point.''
   Sock Shop also operates 105 stores in Britain and 15 in
continental Europe.
   ``In the other stores, we're doing very well. We had an
excellent pre-Christmas period both in England and in France and
sales this week in the sales period are also very good,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ahead to the '90s: Stock Traders Seek To Dodge Recession Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the economy heads into choppy waters in 1990,
many investors will try to ride out the storm with what they hope
are recession-resistant stock portfolios.
   For the last several months, managers at investing institutions
have been putting their money in stocks whose fortunes appear least
exposed to the ups and downs of the business cycle.
   At the same time, they have been shunning auto, steel and other
industrial issues that would presumably be most affected by the
first general economic slump since the 1981-82 recession.
   ``The economy's slowing down, no question about it,'' says Peter
Lynch, who runs the Fidelity Magellan Fund, the nation's largest
stock mutual fund with $12.4 billion in assets. ``When that happens
cyclical stocks just don't do very well.''
   The risk of an economy-wide slump ``is higher than at any time
since the 1982 recession,'' says Martin Sass, president of M.D.
Sass Investors Services Inc., an independent money-management firm
with $3.8 billion in accounts.
   Still, Sass assigns only a 25 percent probability to that
outcome, and says he believes lower interest rates and inflation
can help bring new life in 1990 to Wall Street's bull market.
   ``Certainly it's not the early innings of the ball game,'' he
observes. ``But I think there's still some more room here.''
   It's no simple trick to devise a stock-picking strategy for
gains in a rising market while minimizing exposure to losses should
prices decline.
   The traditional way to do that is to concentrate on
``defensive'' stocks like high-yielding utilities and those of
companies with steady, year-in, year-out earnings growth.
   So it comes as no surprise that ``consumer noncyclical'' and
utility stocks ranked first and second in 1989 among the eight
sectors of the stock market tracked by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
   From the end of 1988 through Dec. 26, the consumer noncyclical
index rose 37.86 percent, while the overall Dow Jones equity market
index posted a 24.27 percent gain. The utility index climbed 34.34
percent.
   That struck a marked contrast with increases of just 15.65
percent for the industrial sector, and 5.1 percent for technology
stocks.
   Lynch says those divergent trends have lifted the big-name
consumer stocks to expensive levels. Cyclical stocks may look
cheaper, he says, but they could go lower still if the business
outlook keeps darkening.
   ``I'm still buying stocks every day, but I've been letting cash
build up'' to about 11 percent of the Magellan Fund's assets, he
says. ``I'm not finding many outstanding, attractive bargains.''
   Sass, for his part, thinks the time has come to buy cyclical
issues in such industries as paper, aluminum, steel and chemicals.
   ``The cyclical stocks have gotten killed,'' he asserts. ``Many
of them are trading at levels that already discount a recession, in
my view.
   ``These companies have gotten more lean, more efficient. But the
stocks are very much out of favor, and hardly anyone is
recommending them.''
   Sass pins his hopes that a recession can be avoided partly on
what he sees as a renewed easing of inflationary pressures as the
economy slows. ``The inflation rate could be a positive surprise''
in 1990, he says.
   He also argues that slowdowns in the pace of business can keep
occurring in separate areas of the economy, as they did through
much of the 1980s, without bringing on a recession.
   ``These rolling readjustments,'' he concludes, ``will permit the
long U.S. expansion which began in late 1982 to enter its eight
consecutive year, the longest peacetime expansion on record.''

<TEXT>
   Dresser Industries Inc. has called off its $620
million offer for Smith International Inc., a Houston drill bit
manufacturer, but the oil services company said it is pursuing an
alternate transaction.
   In a one-paragraph news release on Thursday, Dallas-based
Dresser said it was terminating the merger. No details were
provided in the release about the alternative being considered and
company officials declined to elaborate.
   When first announced in November, the companies said the deal
was contingent upon approval by shareholders and federal antitrust
regulators.
   Smith is the nation's second largest drill bit manufacturer and
Dresser is No. 4. Some analysts speculated the Federal Trade
Commission had expressed opposition to the transaction, which would
have put 45 percent of the nation's drill bit industry in one
company.
   Other analysts suggested Smith management may have decided to
remain independent, or had found a better deal than the complicated
Dresser cash, securities and debt-assumption offer.
   Yet others suggested Dresser had uncovered troubling information
in its review of Smith's finances.
   Dresser had sought to buy Smith to broaden its base in the
exploration and production side of the oil business, especially
Smith's expertise in horizontal drilling, considered an important
technique in the reviving industry.

   The corporate bond market enjoyed a banner year
in terms of volume of new issues, but the quality of outstanding
bonds deteriorated and the number of defaulted issues hit its worst
level of the decade in 1989.
   Meanwhile, the municipal bond market saw moderate growth during
the year, reviving a trend that was distorted by the 1986 federal
tax changes.
   In the corporate market, the volume of new bonds in 1989 hit a
three-year high of $133.7 billion, according to a preliminary
figure compiled by Securities Data Co. The figure excludes
so-called ``hybrid'' debt issues such as mortgage-backed securities.
   But of the more than $900 billion in publicly traded corporate
debt outstanding, an estimated $6 billion defaulted during the
year, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   Moody's said an estimated 45 corporations stopped making
payments on their bonds during 1989. That far exceeds the 33
issuers that defaulted in 1986, the previous record high for the
1980s, Moody's said.
   Moody's projects a continued rise in corporate bond defaults in
1990.
   ``You're going to find that some of these near misses of 1989
will default outright in 1990,'' said John Lonski, Moody's chief
economist.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the other major credit-rating company,
does not predict a major increase in defaults this year.
   ``We have not seen a wholesale across-the-board decline in
credit quality over the last six months, nor do we see one in
1990,'' said Gail Hessol, an S&amp;P managing director.
   But, she said, that projection does not include the troubled
junk bond market.
   ``We think the world has not yet seen the worst as far as junk
bond defaults,'' Ms. Hessol said.
   All of the corporate bond defaults in 1989 involved junk bonds,
which are high-yield, high-risk bonds issued by companies with low
or no credit rating. They often are used to raise the funds needed
for leveraged buyouts, in which the assets of the target company
are pledged as collaterial to raise the cash.
   The junk bond market was shaken in 1989 by a number of
well-publicized defaults, including those of Resorts International
Inc. and Integrated Resources Inc.
   If the economy weakens further, as many predict, the number of
defaults this year could be even greater, Lonski said.
   ``A weak economy is going to make it more difficult to disguise
the problems of troubled companies,'' he said.
   Lonski predicts a significant tapering off in new junk bond
issues this year, due mainly to the slowdown in takeovers. About
$25.3 billion worth of junk issues were sold in 1989, down 8.8
percent from 1988, according to Securities Data Co.
   As for investment-grade corporate bonds, Lonski foresees an
increase in new issues this year if interest rates continue to
drop. These new issues primarily will be sold to refund older,
higher-interest bonds.
   In the municipal market, a total of about $120 billion in
long-term new bonds were sold in 1989, according to preliminary
figures by the Public Securities Association.
   That figure is about 3.5 percent above the 1988 total of $116.9
billion, said the PSA, a trade group for the muni bond industry.
   ``The favorable interest rate environment and pent-up demand for
capital has fueled the increase in issuance,'' said PSA President
Heather L. Ruth.
   But both years' figures pale in comparison to the $222.2 billion
of state and local bonds issued in 1985, the year before the 1986
tax law revision. That law made it less desirable for banks to own
municipal bonds, drying up a prime customer for the securities, and
placed certain limits on the amounts of the tax-free bonds
municipal governments may issue.
   Many municipal and state governments rushed to sell bonds before
the tax law took effect. The volume of new bonds more than doubled
from 1984 to 1985.
   But in the past few years, the level of new muni bond sales were
``back to the same trend before there was a rush to market due to
the tax act,'' said PSA Vice President Caroline M. Benn.
   The PSA projects a continued strong supply of muni bonds in 1990
due to a number of infrastructure projects scheduled to start this
year, including a new airport in Denver and a major sewage plant
project in Boston.
   In addition, the PSA predicts that if interest rates continue to
drop, a number of municipalities and states will refund old,
higher-interest bonds.

   Stock prices worked their way higher today in
the last session of a decade of dramatic gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 13.43 to
2,745.73 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 844 up, 586 down and
509 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were buying cautiously in hopes that the
market could get off to a strong start on 1990 next week.
   Much anticipatory attention has focused of late on the so-called
``January effect,'' a historical tendency for the market in general

   But brokers also cited persistent worries about the outlook for

<TEXT>
   Nigeria's oil minister Rilwanu Lukman, who
also serves as OPEC's president, was raised to a new position
within the Nigerian government Friday in a major Cabinet reshuffle,
an official statement said.
   The new oil minister is Jubrin Aminu, a surgeon and former
education minister.
   OPEC was expected to take steps to install a new president. No
one answered telephones late Friday at the offices of the 13-member
cartel.
   The Vienna-based Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
has an alternate president, Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena.
It also has a secretary-general, Subroto, a former Indonesian oil
minister.
   Lukman became external affairs minister, succeeding Gen. Ike
Nwachukwu, who was moved back to the army as a general officer
commanding a division.
   Lukman's new position is considered to be a promotion, officials
said. Nigeria is forging strong diplomatic relations
internationally and Lukman was moved, observers say, because his
achievements as OPEC president and his diplomatic skills make him
well-suited to the post.
   Nigerian President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida took over the defense
portfolio while Defense Minister Gen. Domkat Bali, Nigeria's
longest serving general, was made the new interior minister.
   Three service chiefs in charge of the air force, navy and the
police also were removed and replacements named.

<HEAD>Crop Futures End Mixed in Shortened Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed
Friday in a shortened trading session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading conditions were thin ahead of the New Year's weekend.
The markets closed at noon CST, 75 minutes earlier than usual.
   Old-crop contracts, those for delivery through next summer, were
little changed or lower while manyof the new-crop contracts rose
moderately as traders began to think about the 1990 growing season,
said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
Chicago.
   He said current stocks of grains and soybeans are more than
adequate and there is no danger of supply tightness.
   But any adverse weather beginning next spring could affect next
year's crops, Gustafson said. And with this winter starting out as
a hard one, some traders already are anticipating crop difficulties
in the new year.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to 3 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.09\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to
1{ cents higher with March at $2.39} a bushel; oats were \ cent to

<HEAD>Could Price Increases Mean Less Inflation?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix cycle designator.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer inflation is likely to pick up over the
next month or so, generating complaints from shoppers but barely
producing a reaction of any sort from economists.
   This is the reverse of how it was last year, when tense
economists trained telescopes on the horizon, stepping back from
time to time to issue warnings about the ogre's approach.
Consumers, meanwhile, hardly worried.
   All in all the consumers were right. Inflation did make a thrust
early in the year, accompanied by shrill warnings from the
economists, but it has been diminishing since then. Somehow,
consumers knew all along.
   This time, however, the increase in prices will be hitting in
especially sensitive areas of the market place, particularly at the
fruit and vegetable counters, and in the monthly bill from the
heating fuel supplier.
   Some of the price jumps, such as 35 percent from some heating
oil dealers, might remind people of the late and unlamented 1970s,
when prices changed so fast that people bought in advance of need,
figuring they'd save that way.
   But none of this is likely to excite forecasters, the very ones
who raised the alarm in 1989. It isn't systemic this time, they
explain, meaning that the cause lies in isolated, temporary factors
rather than a faulty economy.
   Still, that economic assumption might not be as sound as it
seems, relying as it does on still another forecast, this one of
meteorological conditions.
   Weather over the years has demonstrated that it presents
forecasting problems equal or worse than those encountered in
economics. Nevertheless, the relative calmness of economists is
based on a quick return to normal weather.
   Winter came early, savagely and relentlessly to much of the
northern tier of the United States, and thrust cold waves deep into
the South.
   In the North, and in much of the South too, it meant higher fuel
usage, the threat of shortgages and higher prices. Making matters
worse, it forced some refineries to close. Farther south it
destroyed vegetable and fruit crops.
   Economists now assume the severe weather factor will abate,
although like so many of their assumptions _ about politics, for
example _ they have very little expertise in the area. Regardless,
they say, winter ends in three months.
   Meanwhile, there could be an economic effect of an opposite sort.
   Because of added costs in the food and fuel areas, millions of
consumers might have less to spend on other goods and services.
That could lead to lower prices for some items, enough even to
offset the food and fuel inflation.
   Moreover, if the cold weather continues _ in this city it
averaged more than 10 degrees a day below normal for December _ it
could further reduce demand by making it too uncomfortable to look
for cars and houses.
   Thus, those higher food and fuel prices that will have people
grumbling over the next few weeks aren't likely to bother the
professional inflation watchers.
   As they see it, those higher prices are isolated and temporary.
Why, they say, it is even possible they could help lower inflation.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London share prices rose in abbreviated trading
Friday, propelled by hearty yearend demand.
   Sentiment was helped by news that Britain's merchandise trade
deficit narrowed to a better-than-expected 1.52 billion pounds,
$2.4 billion, in November from 1.83 billion pounds, $2.9 billion,
the previous month.
   The government's report raised hopes that interest rates won't
be pushed higher. Higher opening prices in New York also boosted
London trading.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 23.9
points, or 1 percent, at 2,422.7 points, just below its peak of
2,422.8 points. At its lowest, the index opened at 2,399.1.
   Trading closed at 3:30 p.m. (1530 GMT), 90 minutes hours earlier
than normal, ahead of the four-day New Year's weekend.
   Volume amounted to 333.1 million shares, compared with 327.8
million shares which had changed hands by 3 p.m. Thursday.

<HEAD>Another Wild Week For Heating Oil, OJ Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A shot of OJ with a heating oil chaser was the New Year's drink
of choice in the commodity pits.
   Orange juice futures rallied this past week after a damaging
freeze in the Florida citrus belt, and heating oil for January
delivery finished with a record high.
   On other markets, precious metals futures nosedived, most grain
and soybean futures fell, and livestock and meat futures were
little changed.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice for delivery in January soared
21 percent during the holiday-shortened, four-day trading week,
settling Friday at $1.6565 a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange
compared with $1.37 a week earlier.
   The contract jumped 16 cents on Tuesday alone as traders
returned from the long Christmas weekend to reports of widespread
damage to the Florida orange crop.
   Buying pressure eased on Wednesday, when profit-taking took the
January contract down nearly 3 cents. But the rally resumed
Thursday from news that Brazil, a major supplier of orange juice to
the United States, was suspending juice exports until next week,
when an official estimate of the Florida damage is expected.
   Analysts said Brazilian imports could increase by 20 percent
because of the Florida freeze. They said Brazilian officials are
probably trying to decide whether to raise the prices of their
orange juice.
   Futures prices jumped again Friday amid forecasts for a return
to normal temperatures in Florida this weekend. A warmup would
hasten the falling and rotting of freeze-damaged fruit and make it
more vulnerable to spoilage.
   ``Quite frankly, for some growers in Florida, this has been a
disaster,'' said Bert Ruiz, a vice president of Balfour Maclaine
Futures Inc.
   On the other hand, he said, speculators who bought the market
prior to the Christmastime freeze ``were paid handsomely.''
   The contract for January delivery of home heating oil expired
Friday at a record high of $1.06 a gallon the New York Mercantile
Exchange compared with 81.74 a week earlier, a 30 percent gain.
   Just one month ago, January heating oil was trading at about 62
cents a gallon.
   Jay Klopfenstein, head of Norwood Securities Inc. in Chicago,
called the market's gains ``a once-in-a-decade type of movement.''
Analyst Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. described the December
rally as ``one of the most spectacular bull moves in heating oil of
all time.''
   The rally was largely linked to the unusually cold weather in
recent weeks, which caused shortages of home heating oil on the
cash market. The problem has been most severe in the heavily
populated Northeast, where this December has been among the coldest
ever.
   January heating oil rose sharply on Tuesday and Wednesday, then
retreated Thursday after hitting $1.02 a gallon early in the day.
   The market seemed to have peaked. But buyers roared back on
Friday and bid the price up to $1.06 by the close, reflecting
uncertainty over next week's weather.
   The late rally raised speculation that the market will continue
to surge when trading resumes next week.

<NOTE>Precious Metals</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Gold and silver futures prices fell sharply on New York's
Commodity Exchange, reflecting the withdrawal from the market of
investors who had bought heavily during late October and November
amid the startling political changes in Eastern Europe.
   The execution last week of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
and the surrender to the Vatican of ousted Panamanian strongman
Manuel Noreiga seemed to ease investor fears about heightened
international tensions, analysts said.
   Traders also were disappointed that the Soviet Union has not
announced plans to back its currency with gold, as some experts had
expected, said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with
Josephthal &amp; Co.

<NOTE>Grains and soybeans</NOTE>

   The soybean market again led most grain futures lower as growing
conditions for the Brazilian soybean crop continued to improve.
Warmer temperatures in the Great Plains and forecasts for
above-average precipitation in that region next week weighed on the
wheat market, where traders are keeping a close watch on conditions
for the winter wheat crop.

<HEAD>Help Wanted Index Falls, Shows Weakening Labor Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A widely watched measure of the labor market
sent out weak signals in November, a business research group
reported Monday.
   The Conference Board said the Help-Wanted Index dropped six
points in November, erasing almost all of October's five-point gain.
   The seasonally adjusted index fell to 145 in November from
October's 151 and September's 146. The November reading was 11
points lower than the year- earlier level.
   ``As the decade ends, the economy is not now growing fast enough
to keep up with the rise in the working-age population,''
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said. ``Consequently, new
entrants, or re-entrants, to the workforce spend a little more time
finding jobs,'' he said.
   ``Clearly, this is a weakened labor market but not a declining
one,'' he said, noting that the U.S. unemployment rate probably
will edge up in 1990.
   The jobless rate was 5.4 percent in November, up from 5.3
percent in October and the same as in November of 1988. Goldstein
said the rate may rise to 5.8 percent by June.
   Job advertising volume fell in seven of the nine regions of the
country measured by the New York-based research group. Only the
East South Central and Mountain regions showed increases while New
England continued to be the weakest as it has been for several
months.
   The Help-Wanted Index is based on ad volume in 51 major
newspapers across the country. The Conference Board says ad volume
has proven to be sensitive to labor market conditions and provides
a gauge of change in the supply of jobs.

<HEAD>Unfinished Business of '89 Comes Back to Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the budget deficit to bad loans, from
bankruptcies to unsaleable junk bonds, one of the biggest
unfinished stories of 1989 boils down to borrowed money.
   The consequences of selling, trading and repackaging debt are
only now beginning to bubble to the surface, economists and
financial strategists say.
   ``What's still unfinished is determining how excessive was the
excess lending,'' said James Grant, a credit-market analyst who
writes a newsletter about interest rate trends.
   ``That's not just the unfinished business of the year but of the
decade,'' Grant said. ``So what we'll discover as the `90s roll in
is just how reckless was reckless.''
   The final weeks of the year left the federal budget deficit
growing so fast it could bump against the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman
annual ceiling eight months before the fiscal year ends,
threatening to provoke a new round of cuts in government aid
programs at a time when the ranks of the poor are growing.
   Bankers on both coasts have suddenly realized what their
counterparts in the oil and farming regions have known for years: A
declining property market makes mortgages to many homebuyers and
developers unprofitable, compounding the default problems raised by
other risky lending.
   ``I think our society is debt fragile,'' said Robert Dugger,
chief economist of the American Bankers Association in Washington.
``And a major part of the unfinished business left over for the
1990s is correcting the statutory (tax) incentives we have to use
debt rather than equity to finance.''
   Some banking analysts now worry that a severe economic decline
could cause an alarming number of bank failures, forcing the
government to rescue depositor funds with the kind of
megabillion-dollar bailout it faces from the savings and loan
crisis.
   On the corporate level, the twilight of 1989 left some
high-profile companies in almost hopeless hock and others battling
for time to pay their bills, a partial result of an unprecedented
era of debt-financed takeovers.
   The end of the year also cast a shadow on the $200 billion
market for high-yield, high-risk IOUs known as junk bonds, once
considered the wonder-drug of finance but now shunned by many
investors and banks, fearful of getting burned.
   Investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., an aggressive
user of junk bonds for takeovers, watched one of its debt-financed
companies retreat to bankruptcy court this past week. Hillsborough
Holdings Corp., formed by Kohlberg to acquire building materials
maker Jim Walter Corp. for $2.4 billion, sought Chapter 11
protection.
   Perhaps the biggest junk bond casualty is Campeau Corp., the
giant retailer now facing relentless pressure from creditors and
suppliers who want reassurances they'll get paid. Campeau's stores
owe more than $7 billion, which has forced the parent company to
put its crown jewel, the swank Bloomingdale's chain, up for sale.
   Such problems tend to set off chain reactions. For example,
Campeau's inability to pay suppliers could derail another big
debt-financed takeover, the $3 billion acquisition of
sheet-and-towel maker West Point-Pepperell by Chicago industrialist
William Farley, maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear.
   If Campeau can't pay West Point-Pepperell, Farley might have to
sell Fruit of the Loom to pay his debts _ the financial equivalent
of selling the underwear off his back.
   ``All these fellows need nice, pliable suggestable lenders, who
have belatedly woken up,'' Grant said. ``In the debt financing
business, the kneebone's connected to the thighbone.''
   The financing vacuum has frozen the frenetic pace of takeovers,
making the future of that trend another piece of unfinished
business for the year. Few deals over $2 billion _ a paltry sum by
last year's standards _ were completed in 1989.
   ``The megadeals are pretty much gone,'' said Steven P. Galante,
managing director of Buyout Publications, a Needham, Mass.,
newsletter that tracks developments in corporate mergers.
   ``Primarily it has to do with the lenders,'' Galante said.
``They're under intense scrutiny. They're not making loans at
prices that have been paid in the past.''
   Fears that debt and bankruptcy will be the business legacy of
the '80s are by no means universal. Many economists reject this
thinking as outdated and overblown. Some say the U.S. economic
position at the end of the year was stronger than ever and that
most corporate borrowing remains healthy.
   ``I don't believe the trouble in the junk bond market means that
deals that aren't appropriate on their merits won't get done,''
said Giulio Martini, economist at Sanford C. Berstein &amp; Co., a New
York investment firm.
   ``The junk bond market is a $200 billion market in a $5 trillion
economy. You'd have to have more severe problems to have much of an
effect,'' said Martini, who has forecast a relatively strong
economy for 1990.
   Others believe the problems faced by businesses that have risked
their existence through debt are simply paying the price of
surviving in a capitalist economy. The net result, they say, is
more efficiency.
   ``Most of the companies that go bankrupt continue to produce
goods and services,'' said Allan Meltzer, an economist at the
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ``When people get wiped
out, somebody takes their place.''
   In other business and economic news during the last week of the
year:
   _Signs of trouble in the domestic auto industry intensified with
the announcement that General Motors Corp. would cut 3,200
production jobs. The three U.S. automakers plan to idle most of
their plants temporarily because of slow sales, which some
economists see as evidence of a possible recession.
   _The Securities and Exchange Commission named a new top cop to
police the stock and bond markets. Twelve-year SEC veteran lawyer
William McLucas will preside over a major expansion of the
enforcement division, which led the crackdown on Wall Street
corruption in the 1980s.
   _Japan unveiled a major reform package of economic steps
designed to make the world's wealthiest country an importing
powerhouse in the next decade. The Japanese have been persistently
criticized by the United States and other major economic partners
for running up large trade surpluses and arousing protectionist
feelings.

   Energy futures prices surged Friday as a late
rally boosted heating oil to a six-year high on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Heating oil for delivery in January, which had declined Thursday
after a two-week rise, jumped 5.47 cents to finish at $1.0187,
helped by a wave of frenzied buying in the final 30 minutes of
trading.
   Heating oil last closed higher on Jan. 27, 1984, when it settled
at $1.0497, said Pat Kelly, an exchange official. The contract
traded as high as $1.10 a gallon, an all-time high, before easing
off.
   Analysts attributed much of the gains to last-minute buying
ahead of the January contract's expiration at the close of trading.
   Nevertheless, the buying spree surprised many traders, said
Peter Beutel, energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   ``It came on the last trading day of the contract. That
definitely helped,'' Beutel said.
   Heating oil contracts for later delivery posted gains of between
0.60 cent and 1.27 cents a gallon.
   Meanwhile, wholesale unleaded gasoline futures also soared,
boosted by an industry report that showed a sharp drop in supplies.
The January unleaded gasoline contract, which also expired Friday,
rose 3.11 cents to end at 63.22 cents a gallon in a modified
trading session. Other contracts gained between 1.05 cents and 2
cents.
   Trading ended at 1 p.m. EST because of the New Year's holiday.
   West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. grade of crude oil,
finished at $21.82 per 42-gallon barrel, up 32 cents on the
exchange. Later contracts advanced between 16 cents and 34 cents.
   ``The real surprise was the sharp gains in gasoline,'' said Bob
Baker, energy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``The
draw on inventories simply was a surprise for the market.''
   The American Petroleum Institute, in its weekly inventory
report, said that gasoline supplies fell 4.8 million barrels last
week to 221.7 million barrels.
   Heating oil and other distillate fuel oil stocks declined 4
million barrels to 112.2 million and crude oil inventories declined
by 4.3 million barrels to 343.5 million.
   Analysts said investor concern over possible tight supplies of
oil and gasoline fueled some of the buying, even though the effects
of the record-setting cold snap that boosted the price of heating
oil in recent days was believed to be tapering off. Heating oil has
risen 45 percent since Dec. 15 when it closed at 70.42 cents a
gallon.
   While demand for heating oil and other domestic fuels remains
strong, actual shortages are not expected to occur, they said.
   Nevertheless, refinery problems in some southern states remained
a concern, observers said.
   ``People decided that if refining problems are going to be the
norm, gasoline is going to be bullish,'' said Linda Simard, energy
broker for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Analysts said investors are expecting further refinery problems
if unseasonably cold weather persists in January and February.
   Frigid weather in the last two weeks has caused operating
problems at several Texas and Louisiana refineries. Some plants
closed temporarily and others cut back operations, while crude oil
shipments were delayed in some parts of the country.
   Heating oil prices got a boost early in the week after last
Sunday's explosion at Exxon Corp.'s Baton Rouge, La., refinery. The
plant, closed since the explosion, was expected to resume partial
operations this weekend, Exxon officials said.

   Heck's Inc., unable to turn a profit
despite emerging from federal bankruptcy court protection,
announced plans Friday to sell its retail operations, including 55
discount stores in six states, to New York-based Jordache
Enterprises Inc.
   Faced with mounting debts that totaled $9 million since
February, Heck's essentially decided to give away its retailers to
a subsidiary of Jordache which in return will assume the chain's
debts and longterm obligations, said Maartan Hemsley, Heck's chief
operating officer.
   Heck's said in a statement it would receive ``nominal
consideration'' in exchange for the Take 10 Discount Club stores in
West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and
Tennessee, plus its headquarters building in Nitro, W.Va. and
warehouses in Nitro and Poca, W.Va.
   Retail Acquisition Corp., the Jordache subsidiary, will assume
all debts associated with the retail operations, including $22
million in mortgages and $3.5 million in annual rent, Heck's said.
The deal is scheduled to be completed by spring.
   Hemsley said the company will move its headquarters to
Pittsburgh and concentrate on its wholesale operation, which
distributes automotive merchandise through its Steel City Products
division.
   He said no more than one or two Heck's employees will be
transferred to Pittsburgh. The fate of the remaining 2,000 Heck's
employees won't be known until a definitive sale agreement is
completed next month, he said.
   Heck's Chairman John Isaac Jr. said in a prepared statement that
slow sales during the Christmas shopping season proved that the
chain could not make enough money to keep the stores open.
Operating losses for the quarter ended Nov. 25 were about $8
million, Issac said.
   Heck's, which once operated stores throughout the Southeast and
Midwest, cut its employment from 5,900 to 2,000 and closed more
than 100 stores from 1987 to 1989.
   When the company emerged from bankruptcy protection on Sept. 25,
it changed the name of its stores to Take 10 Discount Club and
instituted a ``membership'' program for additional discounts in an
effort to attract customers.
   Heck's stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange before
its bankruptcy filing, and it once owned a discount shoe retailer,
a string of women's apparel shops and a furniture store.
   Under the agreement announced Friday, Retail Acquisition Corp.
will lease all Heck's retail properties from Jan. 31 to March 15,
after which the sale will be completed, subject to approval by
Heck's stockholders.
   As part of the agreement, Retail Acquisition agreed to buy all
automotive merchandise for the former Heck's stores from the Steel
City division for at least three years.
   This will be Jordache's entry into the discount retail market,
Hemsley said.
   ``This is their first retail operation,'' he said. ``They had
some prior involvement. But they haven't been in this kind of
business at this time.''

<DATELINE>PERTH, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Australian brewing interests of Bond
Corp. Holdings Ltd. were placed in receivership Friday by a state
Supreme Court after National Australia Bank Ltd., a major lender,
requested the action.
   The court decision raised speculation that similar action might
be taken by Bond's other creditors and force into receivership the
entire group of companies held by the company, which is controlled
by millionaire Alan Bond.
   ``In theory, it could trigger the repayment of every other
facility we have,'' said Peter Lucas, executive director of Bond
Corp. ``It could bring Bond down.''
   Bond, chairman of the cash-strapped media, brewing, natural
resources and property company, vowed to fight the decision and
immediately launched rival court action to fend off the
receivership.
   The court ruling in the state of Victoria followed Bond Corp.'s
disclosure that it planned to sell its Australian brewing assets,
among Bond's main businesses.
   The move cast further doubt on the future of the G. Heileman
Brewing Co., based in La Crosse, Wis. Bond purchased Heileman in
1987 for about $1.3 billion and reportedly still owes about $850
million after selling the profitable Heileman Baking Co. and other
Heileman subsidiaries.
   In November, Heileman announced it was given a waiver on its
loans from U.S. and Canadian banks. The company said the agreements
with creditors would give it until next June to rebound from a
declining market share and sales.
   Telephone calls by the Associated Press to Heileman offices
Friday in La Crosse were not answered.
   National Australia Bank, which requested the court action, is a
major lender to Bond Corp. National Australia Bank heads a
syndicate of banks which it says is owed 880 million Australian
dollars, or $695 million U.S., by Bond Corp.
   The banks include First National Bank of Boston, Hong Kong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp., Toronto Dominion Bank, Mitsubishi Trust &amp;
Banking Corp. and Standard Chartered PLC of Britain.
   Bond issued a statement Friday saying the brewing units have not
missed any principal or interest payments to the Australia bank-led
syndicate.
   Bond Corp. also stated that, ``In light of the strong financial
condition of the breweries, there is absolutely no foundation for
the allegation that a serious deterioration in the business puts
the lenders at risk.''
   The Bond units included in Friday's court action include Bond
Brewing Holdings Ltd., Bond Brewing Investments Pty., Swan Brewery
Co., Castlemaine Perkins Ltd., Tooheys Ltd. and BBH Securities Pty.
   The bank's announcement came hours after Bond Corp. announced it
had reached agreement to sell its Australian breweries to its 58
per cent owned Bell Resources Ltd. for 2 billion Australian
dollars, or $1.6 billion U.S.
   Bond Corp. had proposed in May to sell its brewing assets,
including Heileman. But the company later changed plans and
postponed the sale of the U.S. company.
   In its fiscal year ended June 30, Bond Corp. lost 980.2 million
Australian dollars, the largest annual loss in Australian corporate
history. Much of the loss was due to one-time write-downs of the
value of some of Bond Corp.'s assets.

   Stock prices forged ahead today in an upbeat
ending to a decade of dramatic gains.
   Analysts said traders were buying cautiously in hopes that the
market could get off to a strong start on 1990 next week.
   Much anticipatory attention has focused of late on the so-called
``January effect,'' a historical tendency for the market in general
and small stocks in particular to do well in the early stages of a
year.
   But brokers also cited persistent worries about the outlook for
the economy over the next several months.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the index of
leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in November after
posting a revised 0.3 percent decline the month before.

   Fur retailer Antonovich Inc. announced Friday it
has sought federal bankruptcy court protection because of financial
problems caused in part by a weak fur market.
   The New York-based company, which runs nine stores in New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut, blamed ``serious cash flow''
difficulties for its decision to file for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.
   The cash crunch was created by a ``number of serious problems
over the past few months,'' the company said, but did not
elaborate. Company executives refused to discuss the situation.
   The financial trouble developed despite a $4 million infusion
Antonovich received in July when investors bought a controlling
interest in the company.
   Peter Masanotti, a Fairfield, Conn., attorney with the law firm
representing Antonovich, said the bankruptcy court filing was
necessary now because the company faces a series of hefty payments
to lenders in the next few months.
   Masanotti said weakness in the market also has contributed to
Antonovich's troubles.
   Fur sales have been in a slump that started with the October
1987 stock market crash, industry analysts say. More recently,
prices have been weighed down by an oversupply.
   Antonovich and the two other major publicly traded fur companies
all experienced losses in their past two fiscal years.
   As of Dec. 1, Antonovich had about $20.4 million in liabilities
and $18.8 million in assets, according to document filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
   Phil Bell, Antonovich's president, said in a news release that
the company intends to reorganize and will continue operating
during bankruptcy court proceedings. Besides selling furs,
Antonovich provides related services such as storage, cleaning,
repair, restyling and insurance.
   ``Our current sales and sales projections are encouraging, and
at this juncture we are optimistic,'' Bell said.

   The planned 1992 unification of Europe and the opening of the
Eastern bloc created the prospect of economic opportunities that
propelled major foreign stock markets to double-digit gains in 1989.
   Investors worldwide scrambled to put money on the Continent _
U.S. investors pumped money into mutual funds that invest in Europe
and the Japanese set up their own stock funds invested specifically
in West German companies, seen as the most immediate beneficiaries
of the Iron Curtain's collapse.
   In the past two months, foreign appetite for German stocks has
helped boost the Frankfurt market to an annual net gain of 35
percent.
   But Germany's market performance was not an isolated one. Key
stock indices in London and Milan also rose impressively, as did
the world's largest stock market, Japan.
   Japan's stock market seemed to be on a record-setting spree
throughout the year. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average opened the
year at a record high of 30,243.66; it finished the year Friday at
38,915.87, the fourth consecutive day of record closings and a 29
percent gain over 1988.
   Analysts in Tokyo said the market overcame a number of obstacles
this year, including the death of Emperor Hirohito in January,
political instability, currency fluctuations and fear of creeping
inflation.
   The market's strength was underscored in October when the Nikkei
failed to follow Wall Street's precipitous Oct. 13 drop, when the
Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.1 percent in value.
   The key British stock index fell 3.2 percent and the Frankfurt
market lost 13.2 percent in response to Wall Street's drop, but
Tokyo shares declined only 1.8 percent before rebounding.
   Despite the mini-crash, ``the biggest event of the year is the
opening up of Eastern Europe,'' said Robert Rolland, executive vice
president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., in New York. ``That's
definitely the theme going into the '90s, and it obviously
overshadows any one-day drop in the stock market.''
   In Frankfurt, the FAZ 100-share index rose 35 percent to finish
the year at 740.90, up from 549.86 at the start of 1989.
   Rolland characterized the recent buying of German stocks and
stock funds _ particularly by the Japanese _ as ``almost a
frenzy.'' Because German stocks typically are not split, their
prices can become prohibitively expensive. Deutsche Bank, for
example, is trading in the $490-a-share range.
   But the Germany Fund, a closed-end mutual fund that trades on
the New York Stock Exchange, can be had for $19 a share, Rolland
said. About a year ago the Germany Fund sold for $6.62{ a share.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished the year at 2,422.7, up from 1,793.1 at the beginning of
1989. Investors were attracted to British companies because they
have issued little debt in comparison to their American
counterparts.
   But volume was disappointing, prompting investment firms to cut
costs through layoffs and other measures.
   Elsewhere in Europe, takeover fever gripped France in 1989 and
helped push the CAC-40 index up 27 percent on the year.
   ``Not only was it takeovers driving the market, but the
possibility of takeovers ... ahead of 1992,'' when Europe will meld
into a single, barrier-free market, Rolland said.
   Among the larger deals, the bank holding company Cie. Financiere
de Suez took over Cie. Industrielle and its insurance subsidiary
Groupe Victoire for about $4.1 billion after a brief but bitter
fight.
   In Italy, the key BCI index rose 17 percent, from 589.72 to
687.44 on Friday. Italy also is positioning itself for 1992, but
the country's overwhelming debt _ which roughly equals its gross
national product _ has created drag on the stock market, experts
say.
   ``There's a perception of negativity'' in Italy, said Guy Stern,
an analyst at ABD Securities Corp. in New York. ``They have to
reevaluate their national strategy and how they will expand.''
   The Italian market began to rally in late May when giant Fiat
announced a major share buyback program but stumbled later over an
Italian bank's unauthorized loans to the Iraqi government. The
country was dealt a further blow when Fiat failed to strike a deal
with the Swedish automaker Saab, which instead allied itself with
General Motors Corp.
   The unheralded growth market was Spain. It is not yet attracting
much foreign capital, and the Madrid General Index rose just 8
percent this year. But Stern noted that Spain has the fastest
growing gross domestic product of any European country with the
exception of Portugal.

<HEAD>Executives Get Prison for Adding Animal Parts to Meat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday sentenced two meat
company executives to up to two years in prison for illegally
adding animal parts and other substances to meat and ordered
$285,000 in restitution.
   West Meat Co., president Joseph A. West and his son, processing
plant manager Jeffrey L. West, pleaded guilty in August to charges
of adulterating meat in violation of federal meat laws.
   U.S. District Judge William Hungate sentenced the elder West to
two years in prison and his son to 21 months. The two men and the
company were ordered to pay a total of $285,000 in restitution to
the state.
   West Meat, based in the St. Louis suburb Rock Hill, was charged
in a federal indictment last June with adding ``unidentified
substances previously packaged as pet food,'' to ground beef, pork
sausage and Polish sausage.
   The meats were sold to about two dozen state hospitals, schools
and prisons between October 1987 and October 1988, when the scheme
was uncovered by federal investigators, the indictment said.
   The government said that in addition to the pet food substances,
beef blood, poultry parts, bones, deer meat, water and extra fat
were added to ground beef. Pork sausage was adulterated with
several items, including adrenal and salivary glands.
   Jim Greene, a spokesman for the U.A. Department of Agriculture's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, said West Meat had voluntarily
ceased operations in May. He said the USDA would withdraw
inspection services, preventing the company from reopening.
   Earlier this month, West Meat was banned from doing business
with Missouri for 20 years. A state circuit court judge also
ordered the company to pay $20,000 to the state and invalidated
more than $40,000 in bills owed by Missouri.
   Greene said the USDA had been involved in about 160 such
prosecutions in the last five years.
   The largest penalty ever assessed a company was $2 million
against Sandy Mac Food Co. of Pennsauken, N.J., a ham processing
firm that pleaded guilty to bribing federal inspectors, selling
adulterated hams and falsifying records.
   Greene said there are about 7,000 meat slaughtering and
processing plants in the United States.

   Airport border guards abruptly revoked the
passport and exit visa of a Soviet strike leader Friday as he was
to board a flight to the United States to meet American union
leaders. The U.S. Embassy filed a strong protest.
   Embassy spokesman Jim Bullock said the United States considered
the action a violation of what U.S. officials have been told would
be the new free-exit policy.
   Soviet officials previously had authorized the U.S.
government-sponsored trip by 10 leaders of last summer's national
coal strike. Soviet citizens must obtain an exit visa for each trip
out of the country.
   But permission was refused at the last minute for Sergei V.
Masalovich, a strike leader from Vorkuta in the Soviet Arctic,
Bullock said.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Sergei Komolov said
Masalovich's visa was canceled because the trade union committee in
Vorkuta had stripped him of his duties on the strike committee.
   ``So he cannot be part of the official delegation,'' but may
re-apply for a visa for a private visit, Komolov said.
   The miners were chosen for the trip by their strike committees.
   Bullock responded that Masalovich was traveling on the personal
invitation of the U.S. ambassador and ``an organization cannot
cancel an invitation to a private individual,'' he said.
   Bullock said embassy officials did not know if Masalovich had
been removed from the strike committee, and that it was irrelevant,
even if true.
   Bullock also denied the Foreign Ministry's claim that the
embassy had been notified. ``We find the Foreign Ministry statement
to be false and incomprehensible,'' he said.
   Hundreds of thousands of coal miners went on strike in July in
the Soviet Union's first nationwide work stoppage in decades. The
government quickly gave in, saying complaints of poor social and
economic conditions were justified. But the struggling Soviet
economy has been hard-pressed to fulfill those promises of more
soap, food and social programs.
   Miners in Vorkuta _ famed in the Soviet Union as the site of
harsh prison camps under former leader Josef Stalin _ struck again
in October for five weeks, saying the government failed to keep its
promises to increase pensions and wages and to improve living
conditions.
   The miners are scheduled to meet with U.S. labor leaders,
including AFL-CIO head Lane Kirkland.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Devalues Currency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan government on Friday
devalued its currency for the 40th time this year and raised the
price of gasoline and public transportation.
   The move by the Nicaraguan Central Bank brought the official
rate to 38,150 cordobas per dollar. The previous exchange was
36,330 cordobas per dollar.
   Nicaragua regularly devalues the cordoba because of inflation
and to keep the price for exports competitive. After 1988's 33,000
percent inflation, the government took drastic austerity measures
earlier this year. It slashed the budget nearly in half by laying
off 40,000 government workers and restricting credit.
   Alejandro Martinez, minister of planning and budget, said
recently that the government's austerity program ``has shown
positive effects'' _ inflation this year had been lowered to ``only
1,500 percent.''
   Friday's price rises increased by 30 percent the rate for urban
and inter-city public bus fares. Nicaragua raises the price of
gasoline to keep it at a constant dollar price because it is
dependent on imports, for which it must pay scarce dollars.

   The dollar closed higher on world currency
markets Friday in light dealings ahead of the New Year's holiday.
   Gold prices rose in European and domestic trading after falling
in the Far East. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery settled at $402.50 a troy ounce, up
$3.90 from Thursday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a
late bid for gold at $402.50 an ounce, up $3.50.
   Dealers said the currency market lacked direction on the last
trading day of 1989, and many trading operations closed early.
   ``There was end-of-the-year position squaring,'' said Ron
Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
But by midday, activity was ``virtually at a standstill,'' he said.
   Traders predicted the dollar will begin 1990 on a weak note,
continuing the trend that reflects the strength of the West German
mark.
   ``There's no reason for the trend of a strong mark to change
yet, although we still expect a correction,'' said a corporate
adviser for a U.S. bank in London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 143.40 Japanese yen, from
142.15 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London, it rose to 143.80
yen. In New York, the dollar ended the year at 143.85 yen, up from
143.55 on Thursday. The dollar ended 1988 at 122.00 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6115, from $1.6137 late
Thursday. In New York, one British pound cost $1.6105, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.6045. The pound began the year at
$1.8850.
   The dollar closed in New York at 1.6950 West German marks, up
from 1.6875 on Thursday and up from 1.5815 at the beginning of the
year.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.5420 Swiss francs, up from 1.5390; 5.7805 French
francs, up from 5.7675; 1,267.00 Italian lire, up from 1,264.13,
and 1.1588 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1568.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.6923 West German marks, up from 1.6905; 1.5430 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5385; 5.7860 French francs, up from 5.7665;
1.9100 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9000; 1,270.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,264.50, and 1.1587 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1563.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $401.00 a troy ounce,
from $399.50 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $401.00, from $400.00 bid late Thursday. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold fell $1.72 to close at a bid $399.89.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery closed at $5.208 a troy ounce, up from $5.150 on
Thursday. In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $5.18 a
troy ounce, from $5.15 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Heating Oil Futures Climb to Six-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heating-oil futures prices rebounded to close at a six-year high
Friday and gasoline futures climbed sharply on indications that the
push to produce more heating oil is taking a toll on gasoline
supplies.
   Orange juice futures also rose dramatically as temperatures in
Florida continued to warm, threatening further damage to oranges
stricken by last weekend's freeze.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals advanced, grains and
soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Heating oil futures settled .60 cent to 5.47 cents higher on the
New York Mercantile Exchange with the contract for delivery in
January up 5.47 cents a $101.87 a gallon.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .16 cent to .34 cent
higher with February at $21.82 a barrel; unleaded gasoline was 1.1
cent to 3.11 cents higher with January at 63.22 cents a gallon.
   Heating oil last closed higher on Jan. 27, 1984, when it settled
at $1.0497, said Pat Kelly, an exchange official. The contract
traded as high as $1.10 a gallon, an all-time high, before easing
off.
   Trading ended at 1 p.m. EST because of the New Year's holiday.
   Analysts attributed much of the gains in heating oil to
last-minute buying ahead of the January contract's expiration at
the close of trading.
   ``This possibly ends one of the most spectacular bull moves in
heating oil of all time,'' said analyst Peter Beutel of Elders
Futures Inc.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline futures were boosted by an industry
report that showed a sharp drop in supplies.
   The American Petroleum Institute, in its weekly inventory
report, said gasoline supplies fell 4.8 million barrels last week
to 221.7 million barrels.
   Heating oil and other distillate fuel oil stocks declined 4
million barrels to 112.2 million and crude oil inventories declined
by 4.3 million barrels to 343.5 million.
   ``This is normally the low point of the year for gasoline
prices,'' said William Hinton, an energy broker with Stotler &amp; Co.
``But since they're really so pumped up trying to make heating oil,
I think maybe the gasoline season is on.''
   Orange juice futures rocketed higher on the New York Cotton
Exchange, supported by forecasts for a return to near normal
temperatures this weekend in Florida.
   The warmup poses a new threat to oranges damaged by last
weekend's freeze. Warmer temperatures could cause fruit that is not
promptly picked to fall to the ground and quickly rot.
   All contracts for frozen concentrated orange juice settled up
the expanded daily limit of 8 cents a pound except the contract for
January delivery, which rose 7.65 cents to $1.6565 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures rose strongly on New York's Commodity
Exchange, recovering a small share of the ground lost in the two
previous sessions.
   Prices had fallen sharply on Wednesday and Thursday after
several failed attempts to rally February gold through $420 an
ounce.
   Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co.
in New York, called Friday's action ``a small technical bounce.''
   Gold settled $3.80 to $4.60 higher with February at $405.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.8 cents to 5.2 cents higher with January
at $5.208 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed in a quiet, shortened
trading session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to 3 cents higher with March at
$4.09\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
March at $2.39} a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cents lower with
March at $1.53{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 2{ cents
higher with January at $5.68 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures ended narrowly mixed in listless
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .17 cent higher with
February at 77.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .25 cent higher with January at 84.85 cents a pound; live hogs
were .08 cent to .78 cent lower with February at 48.70 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .35 cent higher
with February at 49.90 cents a pound.

<HEAD>S&amp;P: Inflation Will Remain Near 4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. predicted Friday that
inflation will remain near 4 percent in 1990, after opening the
year on a price surge inspired by recent cold weather.
   ``The December cold wave will leave us with a January hangover
of higher prices for heating oil, other energy and fresh fruits and
vegetables,'' S&amp;P Chief Economist David M. Blitzer said in S&amp;P's
semi-annual consumer price forecast. ``But the damage will be
temporary and prices will return to their recent 4 percent track.''
   Blitzer said the soft economy will push consumer price inflation
below 4 percent by late in the year.
   S&amp;P is an investment advisory service that also rates debt
securities and distributes a series of widely followed stock
indexes.
   Through November, consumer prices have risen at an annual rate
of 4.6 percent, enough to cause the Federal Reserve to move
cautiously.
   ``Four percent inflation doesn't disturb most politicians or
most people, but it does bother the Federal Reserve,'' he said.
``Even with a soft economy, the Fed will continue to watch the
inflation measures very carefully.''
   Inflation has been close to 4 percent since 1983, the first full
year of the current record economic expansion. However, entering
the eighth year of strong growth without a substantial decline in
inflation is ``rather frustrating,'' Blitzer said.
   S&amp;P also predicted that air travel will rise 2 percent in 1990,
although bargain hunters should still find good deals; domestic
auto prices may drop; clothing prices will stabilize or drop;
gasoline prices will level out; and food prices will remain in
check.

   Hyundai Motor America on Friday recalled 242,972
1986 and 1987 model Excel automobiles for emission-control repairs.
   Excels involved were not sold in California. Without the work
they could fail emissions tests required in many states, Hyundai
said.
   Excel owners will be notified by mail and may take their cars to
a Hyundai dealer for the service, which will be free of charge and
take about one hour, the company said.
   The repairs include modifying the choke system, installing a new
carburetor jet, enlarging a port in the air cleaner and resetting
ignition timing.
   The recall represented more than half of Hyundai's total sales
of 432,492 cars for 1986-87. That figure includes all models, and
includes California sales.

   Canon U.S.A. Inc. has agreed to pay $2.5
million to settle allegations that it overcharged the federal
government for copiers, the Department of Justice announced Friday.
   The department contended that Canon submitted incomplete and
inadequate price information to the General Services Administration
in bidding for contracts to rent and sell copies to federal
agencies.
   As a result, GSA was unable to negotiate prices equal to those
offered by Canon to its most favored commercial customers, the
department said.
   The alleged overcharges occurred during fiscal years 1984 and
1985.
   At Canon's headquarters in Lake Success, N.Y., company spokesman
Hajima Hirai declined comment on the department's announcement
except to say, ``We are satisfied with the way it is written.''
   The settlement was negotiated by the Commercial Litigation
Branch of the department's Civil Division.

   The stock market closed out a decade of dramatic
gains with a broad advance Friday as traders finished up their
yearend shuffle on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.90 to 2,753.20,
extending its gain for the week to 41.81 points.
   In 1989 the average climbed 584.63 points, or 26.96 percent,
capping off a rise for the decade of 1,914.46 points, or 228.25
percent.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,083 up, 484 down and 425 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were buying cautiously in hopes that the
market could get off to a strong start on 1990 next week.
   Much anticipation has focused of late on the so-called ``January
effect,'' a historical tendency for the market in general and small
stocks in particular to do well in the early stages of a year.
   But brokers also cited persistent worries about the outlook for
the economy over the next several months.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the index of
leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in November after
posting a revised 0.3 percent decline the month before.
   Smith International dropped ~ to 12{ and Dresser Industries was
down ~ at 44~. Dresser said late Thursday it had called off its
planned acquisition of Smith International.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose { to 41|;
International Business Machines held steadyu at 94[; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph slipped [ to 45{, and American Express was up

   Closed-end funds investing in single countries or regions of the
world remnained one of the market's hottest groups. Italy Fund
gained 2| to 17; Austria Fund 1 to 20{, and Templeton Emerging
Markets Fund { to 15\.
   One Price Clothing Stores, traded in the over-the-counter
market, fell 1} to 9. The company said it expected to report a
significant decline in its fourth-quarter earnings because of
sluggish sales.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.94 million
shares, up from 128.03 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 185.52 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $28.19 billion, or
0.83 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.45 to 195.04.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.99 to 403.49, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.73 at 353.40.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added

   A tanker carrying 13.2 million pounds of
hazardous chemicals ran aground Friday in Lake Erie, but there was
no leakage and the ship was freed a few hours later by Coast Guard
tugboats.
   The 428-foot tanker Kiisla, built and registered in Finland, was
towed by two tugs to the Buffalo Port Authority for inspection.
   The accident tore a hole in the outer hull of the tanker, but
the inner hull was not damaged, Petty Officer Ray Cramer said. The
ship took on some water but did not leak any cargo, Cramer said.
   The Kiisla has an icebreaking hull and is a ``sturdy vessel,''
said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Vern Williams in Buffalo.
   Petty Officer Ray Cramer said the tanker draws 21 feet of water,
but neither he nor Williams knew how deep the bottom was where it
went aground in the mostly ice-covered lake outside Buffalo harbor.
   The tanker was carrying 3,141 metric tons of xylene and 2,876
metric tons of toluene, or about 13.2 million pounds of the two
industrial solvents, to Buffalo, Williams said. Authorities did not
know where the cargo originated.

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Board Completes Search for New Executive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. said Friday it has
completed its search for a new chief executive officer but will not
disclose its choice until next week.
   Campbell Chairman Robert J. Vlasic said the board of directors'
first choice has accepted an offer to succeed R. Gordon McGovern,
who retired in November as president and chief executive officer of
the food-products company.
   The announcement comes amid growing dissent among members of
Campbell's founding family, who control about 59 percent of the
company's 129.6 million outstanding common shares. Three family
members announced Thursday they would sell their 17 percent stake
and urge a sale of the entire company.
   The board is to hold final deliberations on the selection next
week, but company officials said the talks are a formality.
   ``We have interviewed many candidates and are confident that we
have the best qualified person for the job,'' Vlasic said in a
statement.
   Campbell spokesman James H. Moran said he did not know if the
announcement was prompted by a growing rift in the Dorrance family
and increased speculation the company would be put up for sale.
   At the company's annual shareholders meeting in November, Vlasic
said a successor to McGovern would be named early next year.
   Moran said he did not know whom the board picked and could
provide no information about the search.
   The board of directors formed a management succession committee
about a year ago in anticipation of McGovern's retirement.
McGovern, 63, became president and CEO in 1980.
   Executive vice-presidents Herbert M. Baum and Edwin L. Harper
were named to oversee the company's day-to-day operations on an
interim basis. Both were considered candidates to succeed McGovern.
   Campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year. It also owns
Pepperidge Farm, Vlasic Foods, Mrs. Paul's Kitchens, Godiva
Chocolatier and Casera Foods.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell moderately Friday after a
survey of Chicago purchasing executives indicated strength in the
manufacturing sector of the economy.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 5-32 point, or about $1.56 per
$1,000 face amount. Its yield edged up to 7.97 percent from 7.96
percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said an initial report that Chicago purchasing managers
were reporting a slowdown in the economy gave the market a lift,
but when the report was corrected, showing strength among
industrial firms, bond prices turned downward.
   Traders believe the Federal Reserve is more likely to relax
credit and allow interest rates to fall if the economy is slowing.
The report of a pickup in the economy led them to believe the Fed
would not push rates downward.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management will issue its
monthly survey on the economy next week. Traders are looking to
that report and the government's unemployment figures for possible
signals on how the Fed might act.
   Trading was extremely light Friday as most traders had closed
their books for the year.
   The federal funds rate, often an important reflection of the
Fed's credit policy, fell dramatically as the central bank added
funds to the system to help banks meet their yearend needs.
   The rate, which closed at 9} percent on Thursday, fell to 7{

   Analysts said the extra reserves were needed by banks for the

   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to 1-32 point lower, intermediate
maturities were off 1-16 point and long-term issues were down about
3-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.93 to 1,188.41.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.82 percent as the
discount dropped 9 basis points to 7.58 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 7.99 percent as the discount picked up 7
basis points to close at 7.59 percent. Yields on one-year bills
rose to 7.75 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 7.24
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-16 point to 93 14-32. The average

   The stock market put a final flourish on the
``Money Decade'' by climbing to record highs in 1989.
   But the year's advance paid out its benefits very unevenly _ for
example, rewarding investors in energy while stinting on high
technology and industrial America.
   Many of the market's biggest winners and losers for the year
underwent drastic form reversals from earlier in the decade.
   Anyone who witnessed the depression of the mid-1980s in the
nation's ``oil patch'' might have been startled to see the list of
1989's best performing stock groups, as compiled by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
through Dec. 26.
   Oil drilling ranked No. 1, up 87.02 percent; oilfield equipment
and services No. 3, up 56.26 percent, and pipelines No. 6, up 52.93
percent.
   Their resurgence heralded a rebound in prices of energy
commodities, which was given extra impetus by a blast of frigid
winter weather across much of the nation in the last few weeks of
the decade.
   ``Energy will be an enduring theme throughout the '90s,''
asserted John Connolly, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``With U.S. oil production clearly in decline, the non-OPEC free
world has now flattened out. Meanwhile, demand is rising inexorably
as conservation and substitution wane.''
   At the other end of the spectrum stood the computer, its image
badly faded in the investment world from the moment just a few
years earlier when Time magazine accorded it the status of
``machine of the year.''
   Computer stocks, down 18.61 percent, had an uncontested hold on
last place in the Dow Jones group rankings for a year marked by a
steady stream of earnings disappointments in the industry.
   The most celebrated downer among the computer stocks was
International Business Machines, which fell to its lowest levels
since 1983 and finished the year below 100, far short of the peak
of 175~ it reached in 1987.
   But IBM, the long-time darling of investing institutions, was by
no means alone in the doghouse. Unisys, the product of a 1986
merger between Burroughs and Sperry, and Prime Computer both
sustained drops of more than 50 percent at their low points for the
year.
   The question many investors were asking as the 1990s began: Was
the earnings growth potential of the computer dissipating, turning
it into just another cyclical industrial commodity?
   Between extremes like that, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 41.81 points in the last week of the year to
2,753.20.
   That left the average up 584.63 points, or 26.96 percent, for
1989, and up 1,914.46 points, or 228.25 percent, for the decade.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up 3.09 at 195.04; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up 10.25 at 454.82, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up 7.16 at 378.00.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 121.33 million shares a day,
against 168.70 million the week before.
   Some of the brightest stars among individual stocks for 1989
were closed-end investment companies formed in recent years to
invest in the stock markets of countries as diverse as Switzerland
and the Philippines.
   The Spain, Malaysia, Thai and Asia Pacific funds all ranked high
on the list of percentage gainers. They were joined as the year
drew to a close by the Germany and Austria funds, amid intense
demand for potential beneficiaries of the opening of Eastern Europe.
   That underscored one point on which most Wall Streeters readily
agreed: Wherever the markets go in the '90s, the script is likely
to be played out on a truly global stage.

   The recent weather-related jump in energy and wholesale food
prices should have a minimal impact on interest rates barring
severe crop or oil shortages, but frigid temperatures in coming
months could chill investors' inflation outlook, economists said
Thursday.
   A record-setting cold snap in the past week has heavily damaged
fruit and vegetable crops in such major growing areas as Florida
and Texas and sent heating oil prices soaring in many parts of the
country.
   The price of home heating oil and other fuels such as propane
and kerosene have nearly doubled in some areas in the last two
weeks as demand surged and supplies dwindled. Cold weather closed
some refineries in Texas and Louisiana and curtailed crude oil
shipments in some states.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, near-month heating oil
futures jumped more than 40 percent in two weeks _ from 70.42 cents
a gallon on December 15 for the near-term contract to 99.71 cents
on Wednesday. Prices fell 3.31 cents to 96.40 cents a gallon on
Thursday.
   But economists believe the current weather-related price rise is
temporary. As such, it is unlikely to produce a long-term change in
the inflation outlook that would prompt the Federal Reserve to
increase interest rates in an attempt to stem rising prices.
   ``The Federal Reserve would be out of its mind if it changed
economic policy because it's snowing in Florida,'' said Susan
Lakatos, economist with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``If the heating oil situation were so serious and widespread
that it created shortages and closed factories we could expect some
impact on interest rates. But there is no indication of that,'' she
said.
   Nevertheless, the rise in heating oil prices and the deep freeze
that has damaged citrus and other crops have confused the inflation
outlook. Prospects for a drop in interest rates in early 1990 are
being put on hold, analysts said.
   Higher energy and food prices have also altered the inflationary
psychology of the credit and financial markets, with investors less
sure the Fed would act to loosen credit and push interest rates
lower, said John Silvia, economist with Kemper Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Instead of expecting the Fed to ease in January as before,
people will be a lot less optimistic with respect to inflation,
even though everyone knows it's a temporary situation,'' Silvia
said, ``and the Fed will be slower to ease than it might have
been.''
   David H. Resler, chief financial economist for Nomura Securities
International Inc., said the rise in heating oil prices may have
contributed to the rise in short-term interest rates in recent days.
   The federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks charge
each other for short-term loans, surged to 9] percent on Thursday
from 8.19 percent last Friday after holding relatively steady
during the rest of December.
   ``In a thin market with relatively few players around, anxieties
run higher than normal,'' Resler said.
   But investor worries may be premature. Resler said that because
food and fuel are considered nondiscretionary items in a household
budget, higher prices for those produces could mean individuals
simply would cut back on purchases in other areas.
   ``If I get stuck with oil bills 50 percent higher than usual,
the harsh reality is that I will have to spend less on something
else,'' Resler said. ``Over time that would exert downward pressure
on other prices.''
   Peter Greenbaum, economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said that food and energy normally are separated from other
inflation indices because of their short-term volatility. And while
higher prices for heating oil, citrus fruit and vegetables likely
will push the December and January wholesale price indexes up, it
should not amount to a sustained rise in prices, he said.
   ``The core inflation rate should be insulated from these
effects,'' Greenbaum said.

   U.S. industry should enjoy its eighth

the government said.
   In its annual industrial outlook, the Commerce Department

   United Airlines, Trans World Airlines and
Eastern Airlines said Friday they were considering new surcharges
on tickets to help cover the skyrocketing cost of jet fuel.
   Other airlines also may be weighing the measure, which if
imposed would be the first special fuel surcharge by the airlines
since the 1970s oil crisis.
   ``It is a fare increase,'' said Louis Marckesano, an airline
analyst at the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
``It's going to raise the cost of the ticket.''
   A fuel surcharge likely would be figured into fares rather than
charged separately, analysts suggested. They speculated the
airlines might charge around $3 per ticket.
   Earlier this week, in an effort to lure passengers during the
slow winter months, the nation's big airlines cut fares as much as
30 percent in selected markets.
   Oil prices have been catapulted higher recently by the
record-setting cold snap and refinery problems in Texas and
Louisiana. Jet fuel, which represents around 35 percent of an
airline's operating budget, has jumped to 96 cents a gallon from 64
cents at the end of October.
   Every 1 cent rise in the price of jet fuel costs U.S. airlines a
total $150 million a year, according to the Air Transport
Association, an industry group in Washington, D.C.
   ``It has been a precipitous and unprecedented increase in fuel
prices ... considering there hasn't been a disruption in
supplies,'' said Robin Matell, a spokesman for Eastern at its
headquarters in Miami. ``We're reviewing the situation and suspect
other carriers are doing the same. In that sense, a surcharge
cannot be ruled out.''
   Don Morrison, a TWA spokesman in St. Louis, Mo., said, ``We're
in the process of looking at some fuel data. We are looking at some
possibilities.''
   United, the nation's second-largest airline, also is pondering a
charge, said Rob Doughty, a spokesman in Chicago. ``We're looking
at it; no decision's been made,'' he said.
   The airline spokesmen all declined to give further details.
   On Thursday, explaining a new hike in Northeast shuttle fares
from $99 one way to $119 on weekdays, Trump Shuttle cited increased
costs for fuel and other expenses. Trump Shuttle officials weren't
immediately available for comment Friday on whether they were
weighing a surcharge as well.
   Spokesmen for Delta Air Lines, USAir Group Inc. and Pan Am Corp.
said those airlines were not considering a fuel surcharge at the
present time.
   A special fuel surcharge would not require government approval
for domestic flights.
   Such a charge hasn't been imposed in the United States since
1973, when oil prices rose steeply and the federal government
allowed the airlines to raise fares a few dollars to help cover
costs. The U.S. airline industry was deregulated in October 1978.
   Since then, other types of surcharges have been instituted _ for
airport security and for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Some
U.S. carriers, such as Pan Am and TWA, add $5 to the cost of a
trans-Atlantic ticket to cover security screening for international
flights.
   The aviation trust fund is supplied by an 8 percent tax that is
included in fares. Because of pressure to reduce the federal budget
deficit, neither the White House nor Congress has been willing to
dip into the fund, which hit $6.9 billion in September.
   Under legislation before Congress, the money would be released
to pay for devices to detect plastic explosives in baggage.
   ``Fuel surcharges are a way of life in Europe,'' said Paul Turk,
an analyst with consulting firm Avmark Inc. in Arlington, Va.

   The government said its chief barometer of

   The Commerce Department said Friday the small rise in its Index
of Leading Economic Indicators followed a revised 0.3 percent
decline in October.
   For most of the year, the leading index has been flashing

   The once-raucous takeover business ended the
1980s subdued and humbled as the value of corporate acquisitions
plunged more than 60 percent in the fourth quarter from the
stratospheric levels of a year earlier.
   There were 935 acquisitions valued at $72.2 billion announced
during the last quarter of 1989. A year earlier, when the merger
business reached its zenith with the record $24.53 billion buyout
of RJR Nabisco Inc., there were two fewer deals, 933, but the
acquisitions totaled a record $183.1 billion.
   Leveraged buyouts, the debt-financed deals so popular a year
ago, dropped even more sharply. There were 22 LBOs announced during
the fourth quarter of 1989, totaling $15.5 billion _ down 85
percent from the 49 deals worth $102.2 billion in the last quarter
of 1988.
   The figures, compiled by the financial research firm Securities
Data Corp., were unsurprising. The takeover business has been
devastated over the past year by the failure of Campeau Corp.'s
$6.6 billion buyout of Federated Department Stores Inc. and the
subsequent collapse of the market in junk bonds, the high-interest
securities used to finance many buyouts.
   The enthusiasm that takeover strategists and their bankers once
displayed was replaced by caution in 1989. Over the year, 1,447
purchases of U.S. businesses worth a total of $362.7 billion were
announced, down 29 percent in value from the 1,543 acquisitions
worth $511.5 billion in 1988.
   Securities Data considered transactions worth $10 million or
more in compiling its figures.
   The 1989 record of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the company
that bought RJR Nabisco, is an illustration of how times have
changed.
   In 1988, Kohlberg Kravis, considered the leader among leveraged
buyout firms, announced four transactions worth $27.88 billion.
Excluding RJR Nabisco, the company's other deals totaled $3.35
billion.
   But in 1989, Kohlberg Kravis participated in one deal worth just
$310 million, the buyout of several small divisions of Macmillan
Inc.
   Kohlberg Kravis likely adopted the same cautious stance that
other prospective acquirers have had to take.
   Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for the firm, declined to say that
Kohlberg Kravis had become more conservative. However, she said,
``They're not going to do a deal for the sake of doing a deal.''
   Kohlberg Kravis, although buoyed by the stellar performance of
RJR Nabisco this year, has had to contend with financial problems
at some of its smaller units that may have put a crimp into some of
its acquisition plans.
   Earlier this week, Hillsborough Holdings Corp., formed as part
of Kohlberg Kravis' takeover of homebuilder Jim Walter Corp., filed
for federal bankruptcy court protection.
   Another Kohlberg Kravis company, Seaman Furniture Co. has been
forced to reschedule its debt payments, and a third company, SCI
Television Inc. also is trying to renegotiate its debt.
   The slowdown in takeovers also was evident in financing of deals
and merchant banking activity, Securities Data said.
   There were 67 junk bond offerings raising a total of $14.1
billion in 1989, with $4 billion of that amount attributable to
just one deal, the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1988, there were 90 junk
bond offerings that raised $16.4 billion, Securities Data said.
   Meanwhile, major investment banks participated directly in 82
deals worth $24.8 billion this past year. In 1988, there were 83
such transactions, but they totaled $95.5 billion, far
outdistancing the 1989 total.

<HEAD>Freezing Weather Heats Up Market for Heating Oil, Orange Juice Futures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freezing weather is putting the squeeze on
supplies of Florida orange juice and heating oil, but it's
providing hot profits for speculators who own those commodities on
paper.
   Speculative trader George Booth estimates his customers will
make $700,000 to $1 million off the Florida freeze.
   The Norwood Hyacinth Fund, a public futures fund managed by Dunn
Capital Management Inc. in Stuart, Fla., tallied profits of
$383,000 in the heating-oil futures market from Nov. 22 through
Wednesday, according to Jay Klopfenstein of Norwood Securities, the
fund's sponsor.
   The recent rallies in the prices of orange juice and heating oil
have been spectacular.
   The price of heating oil for delivery in January soared 74
percent from Nov. 22 through Wednesday, when the contract settled
at 99.71 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   During the same period, frozen concentrated orange juice for
January delivery surged 23 percent to $1.5015 a pound on the New
York Cotton Exchange, with most of those gains made in the past two
weeks.
   Commodity speculators don't deny the frequent accusation that
they make money from other people's misery, but they do defend
their gains as the hard-won rewards of an extremely risky business.
   In addition, many of them were doing poorly this year until the
record-breaking cold spell hit.
   Mort Baratz, editor of Managed Accounts Report, monitors 169
public futures funds and 129 private investors pools that provide
opportunities for investors to speculate in commodity and financial
futures.
   ``I can tell you that the great majority of them have had a very
difficult year through the end of November,'' Baratz said Thursday.
   ``Suddenly, along comes a cold wave with a substantial effect on
heating oil and orange juice,'' Baratz said in a telephone
interview from his office in Columbia, Md.
   ``Now I'm confident that many of those I follow will recoup
some, if not all, the losses they sustained in first 11 months.''
   A futures contract is the right to buy a set amount of a certain
commodity, such as oil or orange juice, at a certain price on a
certain date.
   There are two kinds of traders in the futures markets:
speculators and hedgers. Hedgers produce or use the commodities
themselves. They buy and sell in the futures markets as insurance
against price swings in the cash markets.
   For example, when a freeze hits, an orange grower can sell
futures contracts at high prices. When prices inevitably fall, he
can buy back the contracts at the lower price and use the profit
from that transaction to offset his cash loss from freeze damage.
   Speculators are not involved in industries that produce or use
the commodity. They merely buy and sell in the futures markets on
the hope of profiting from price changes.
   Booth, of Palo Alto, Calif., calls himself one of the country's
biggest orange juice speculators. His company, George Booth &amp;
Associates Inc., manages about $32 million invested by 15
individual customers and 10 funds and spread among 22 futures
markets.
   Booth said those who depict orange juice speculators as vultures
circling the devastated Florida orange groves don't understand the
realities of frozen oranges or the futures market.
   First of all, he said, freezing an orange reduces its juice
content but doesn't destroy it, so orange growers haven't been
entirely wiped out.
   And many growers are as savvy as speculators at using the
futures market, which is essentially a vehicle for transferring
risk to those willing to accept it.
   A Dec. 22 report from the Cotton Exchange showed hedgers
outnumbering speculators in the orange juice market by about 12,500
to 10,200.

   L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co., the Wall Street firm
devastated by the 1987 stock market crash, is reforming as a
smaller brokerage as its parent company seeks to restructure more
than $100 million in debt in bankruptcy court.
   Creditors of the 90-year-old firm's parent company, L.F.
Rothschild Holdings Inc., approved a plan to issue new bonds to
replace those defaulted on last June, when the company sought
bankruptcy court protection.
   ``We've gone about trying to intelligently refocus the
broker-dealer, which was never part of the bankruptcy,'' Rothschild
Chief Executive Joel E. Miller said in an interview Thursday.
``We're small and lean and well-capitalized for what we do.''
   Since its parent sought protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy law in June, Rothschild &amp; Co. has shuffled
its management and scaled down its businesses in an effort to stay
alive.
   Founded in 1899, the brokerage has 45 workers, up from a low of
about 35 earlier this year but a shadow of its peak employment of
2,200 before the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.
   After suffering substantial losses in the crash, Rothschild
systematically sold or abandoned its retail brokerage, public
finance and municipal bond sales and trading operations.
   It also ceased over-the-counter market making, arbitrage and the
selling and trading of government, mortgage-backed and high-grade
corporate securities.
   Miller said the restructured brokerage would re-enter the retail
brokerage and investment banking businesses. In November, the firm
entered municipal securities trading and the capital markets
business.
   Miller said the brokerage is contacting old clients and would
increase advertising in January to twice a week in The Wall Street
Journal and Investors Daily in an effort to find new customers.
   Rothschild Holdings in early 1988 became a subsidiary of
Franklin Financial Services, which itself is a subsidiary of
Ottawa, Kan.-based Franklin Savings Association.
   On Thursday, Franklin Savings said it would sell Rothschild next
year. The thrift has blamed the brokerage company for its recent
losses.
   Franklin Chairman Ernest M. Fleischer said that a group of
Rothschild employees, led by Miller, ``expressed an interest'' in
buying the company and that the group ``are the most likely
buyers.''
   As of Jan. 1, 1987, Rothschild ranked as the 18th largest U.S.
securities firm with capital of $289 million. By the end of the
year, Rothschild posted a $129 million annual loss, $56 million of
which resulted from arbitrage and over-the-counter trading
positions held during the Black Monday crash.
   Miller said the firm now has a net worth of about $20 million.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Rothschild Holdings showed
losses of $3.81 million on revenue of just $235,000. That compared
with losses of $5.59 million on revenue of $65.0 million a year ago.
   Rothschild Holdings issued a statement Thursday saying its
committee of unsecured creditors had approved the restructuring
proposal. The brokerage subsidiary was not included in the
bankruptcy filing.
   Under the debt restructuring, Rothschild Holdings plans to swap
existing debt for zero-coupon debt in an attempt to cut current
interest payments. Zero-coupon bonds are sold at a discount and
redeemed at maturity at face value, and do not provide periodic
interest payments.
   Rothschild Holdings plans to issue zero-coupon notes worth $29.8
million to replace the defaulted bonds valued at $101 million, the
company said.
   In its bankruptcy court filing, Rothschild Holdings said its
major creditors were Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) with a
$48 million claim, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. with a $24.9 million
claim and Cede &amp; Co. with a $39 million claim.
   L.F. Rothschild is not connected with the New York investment
bank Rothschild Inc.

<HEAD>Music Syndicate Gives HBO Extension of License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The music syndicate BMI agreed Friday to grant a
one-month extension of its license to Home Box Office Inc. at a
``substantially'' higher fee.
   The fee increase was not disclosed. Company officials couldn't
be reached for comment late Friday.
   BMI sued in federal court Thursday to block unauthorized use of
its songs in HBO films, a move that could throw the cable
television programmer's schedule into turmoil.
   BMI asked a U.S. District Court judge to bar HBO from
transmitting BMI songs after Sunday, when the companies' licensing
agreement ends. It noted that several films in HBO's January
schedule include BMI-copyrighted songs.
   But Judge Vincent Broderick declined to issue an immediate bar,
scheduling fuller arguments before another judge, Pierre Leval, on
Tuesday.
   The agreement came in negotiations between representatives of
the two companies, BMI said in a statement.
   BMI said the issues raised in the lawsuit are still unresolved,
and that unless the parties could reach agreement in January, the
litigation will continue.
   ``We hope that we can reach agreement on a new long-term license
in January,'' Frances W. Preston, BMI's president and chief
executive officer, said in the statement. ``But we are prepared to
take whatever action is necessary to protect the interests'' of the
100,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers it represents.
   By law, the writers and publishers are entitled to payment for
the public performance of their music.

<HEAD>Major Airlines Cut Fares in Selected Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to lure passengers during the slow winter months,
the nation's big airlines are lowering fares as much as 30 percent
in selected markets.
   The fare reductions, in effect through early March, only apply
to about 10 percent of the airlines' route networks _ but they
involve densely traveled routes. The move was started by Midway
Airlines, which announced last Saturday one-way fares ranging from
$19 to $99 across its 50-city route system within the continental
United States.
   United Airlines followed suit Wednesday, and United's cuts were
quickly matched in the same markets by Northwest Airlines and Trans
World Airlines. Spokesmen for American Airlines, Delta Air Lines
and Continental Airlines said Thursday those carriers have matched
the move.
   ``We've got to be competitive,'' said Ed Stewart, a spokesman
for American at its headquarters outside Fort Worth, Texas.
   American, the nation's largest airline, will cut fares to about
40 cities from Chicago. That compares with its total network of
about 1,200 markets.
   American's round-trip fares between Los Angeles and New York,
for example, will be cut to $278-$318 from $398-$438. Between
Boston and Nashville, Tenn., fares will drop to $178-$198 from
$238-$278.
   The discounts affect flights between New York, Boston and Los
Angeles and other cities in the continental United States. Arizona,
Florida and Nevada are excluded.
   Analysts said the historical winter slowdown in air travel,
which is expected to be worse than usual this year, motivated the
fare discounts. They are aimed mostly at vacationers, who can meet
the requirements for advance purchase and minimum stays.
   ``We knew that the fourth (1989) and the first (1990) quarters
were going to be very sloppy for this industry,'' said Edward
Starkman, an airline analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   The last major change in fares was in early December, when the
big airlines raised discount MaxSaver fares _ but softened the blow
by eliminating advance-purchase requirements for the popular
tickets during the holiday period.
   Last week, Southwest Airlines cut prices on its longer routes, a
move other carriers followed on a limited basis.
   The new fare reductions require a 14-day advance purchase and a
Saturday night stay.
   Passengers wanting to use the lower fares must make reservations
by Jan. 31. The fares are available only on a round-trip basis and
aren't refundable.

<HEAD>Plants Run 24 Hours To Squeeze Freeze-Damaged Citrus</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Frozen Profits, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's 33 citrus processing plants are
pushing their operations to the limit to squeeze frost-damaged
oranges before they have a chance to rot.
   Truckloads of oranges are flooding plants that are running
non-stop to process the fruit damaged during a two-day Christmas
freeze.
   Industry officials fear several days of 70-degree weather would
cause the damaged fruit to decay and fall from trees if not picked
and processed quickly enough.
   At Tropicana Products Inc., the nation's largest citrus
processor, maximum plant capacity is 36 million oranges a day,
which translates into 1 million gallons of juice.
   All of Tropicana's 400-plus fruit-hauling trailers have been
mobilized to race the clock, said Tropicana Products Inc. President
Robert Soran.
   ``We'll be open 24 hours per day, seven days a week during the
salvage process,'' said Steve Caruso, assistant general manager at
Citrus World, a juice processing plant in Lake Wales that produces
about 400,000 gallons of fresh juice a day.
   The Juice Bowl plant in Lakeland also is running non-stop
indefinitely.
   Gov. Bob Martinez lifted highway weight restrictions on trucks
so citrus growers can move crops faster. And growers have pressed
all migrant farm workers into service to help harvest the fruit
from groves hit hard when the overnight temperature plunged as low
as the high teens last Sunday and Monday.
   The final freeze-damage toll won't be known for some time, but
Soran said that based on recent estimates, Florida may be able to
produce 100 million boxes of oranges this season, down from an
anticipated 130 million boxes.
   A damage estimate is due Jan. 11, said Ernie Neff, a spokesman
for Florida Citrus Mutual, which represents citrus growers.
   Florida and Brazil produce 81 percent of the world's oranges,
almost entirely for juice, and Soran said a recent increase in
Brazilian production means that the overall supply this year may
change very little.
   Juice made from a blend of U.S. and imported oranges may not
fluctuate widely in price at current supply levels, said Soran.
   However, shoppers may pay more for juices made only from Florida
oranges, such as Tropicana's Pure Premium and Minute Maid's Premium
Choice, he said.

   Low-interest federal loans could be
made available to Florida farmers who lost crops in the Christmas
freeze after Gov. Bob Martinez declared the state a disaster area.
   Martinez sent a letter Thursday to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture
Clayton Yuetter asking for approval of the Farmers Home
Administration loans. The governor also signed an executive order
declaring the disaster following several visits to freeze-damaged
farms.
   ``From what I have seen, there is no question that Florida has
suffered devastating losses and that our state is a disaster
area,'' Martinez said. ``We must now do everything we can to help
those whose lives and livelihoods have been ravaged by the
unmerciful weather.''
   The governor's order affects all 67 Florida counties and opens
the door to a possible disaster declaration by President Bush once
the full extent of the losses is known. A presidential declaration
would make unemployment assistance, direct grants and other
assistance as well as FHA loans available to growers.
   The hard freeze Saturday and Sunday nights damaged Florida's
700,000-acre citrus belt as well as winter vegetable crops, many of
which would have gone to markets in the Northeast. The state's
tropical fish industry, sugar cane crops and plant nurseries also
suffered heavy losses.
   Higher vegetable prices have already been reported, but the
impact on citrus prices could be minimal because of a large juice
reserve and the quick processing of frost-bitten fruit into
concentrate.
   Reaction from growers was mixed, with some industry
representatives saying the programs could throw the delicate
supply-and-demand balance of the food business into disarray,
driving down some prices.
   ``It can extend the disaster beyond its time,'' said Reggie
Brown, spokesman for Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association in
Orlando.
   Ernie Neff, spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual in Lakeland,
said not all growers could benefit from disaster programs, but they
could keep some from going deeply into debt.
   ``When you're in a disaster area, you look for all the options.
Not every grower can use them, but it will certainly help some,''
Neff said.
   State agriculture officials will assess the damage in each
county to find the exact losses, which would be needed before a
federal declaration is made. That could take two or three weeks.
   Jon Peck, the governor's press secretary, said it will take time
to ascertain just how much of the citrus crop was lost because some
damaged fruit can still be turned into concentrate for juice.
   Martinez earlier declared a statewide emergency that waived
truck weight restrictions so growers can quickly haul their
products to processing plants.

<HEAD>Investor Group Pushing for Campbell Soup Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissent appears to be growing among members
of the founding family of Campbell Soup Co. as three heirs to the
fortune put their 17 percent stake up for sale and threatened to
oust board members who oppose a plan to sell the food company.
   The group, composed of three nieces of Campbell's late chairman,
John T. Dorrance Jr., and their husbands, said in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing Thursday that it plans to seek ``a price
per share significantly in excess of current market value.''
   The filing ``magnifies and brings to actuality the discord we've
been hearing about among the family,'' said Mary Harden, an
industry anaylst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   ``It's not particularly surprising,'' said Pavlos M.
Alexandrakis, an analyst with Argus Research Corp. in New York.
   Campbell shares have been driven higher in recent weeks by
increasing speculation of dissent within the Dorrance family. On
the New York Stock Exchange, Campbell shares closed Thursday up
$4.37{ to $57.37{ in active trading.
   ``They would seem over the last many months to not have
agreed,'' said Roderick Rumreich, an assistant vice president at
Moody's Investors Service Inc. in New York. ``For any group to
reach an agreement given the recent filings seems somewhat
improbable.''
   James H. Moran, a spokesman for Camden-based Campbell, said the
company had no comment on Thursday's SEC filing.
   Heirs of John Dorrance Sr., the chemist who invented condensed
soup in 1897, control about 59 percent of Campbell's 129.6 million
outstanding common shares, including the three nieces of Dorrance's
son who hold a 17.4 percent stake.
   The group pushing for a sale said it would encourage Campbell's
board of directors to do the same and consider ousting members who
opposed a sale.
   ``They've become much more aggressive about managing their
assets,'' said Rumreich.
   Last week, three children of Dorrance Jr., who died last April
and whose great uncle founded the company, issued a statement
saying they intended to maintain their ownership in Campbell and
keep the company independent. The three recently received control
of their father's 31.3 percent stake in the company.
   Ms. Harden said about 11 percent of the company's stock is in
hands ``friendly'' to the Dorrance children, including Robert J.
Vlasic, chairman of the board, who also opposes a sale.
   Those who want to sell ``are outvoted _ it looks like,'' Ms.
Harden said.
   But Alexandrakis said the family members pushing for a sale
could recruit others if the price was right.
   None of the descendants of Dorrance Sr. have played as active a
role in the company as his son Dorrance Jr. did.
   Alexandrakis described Campbell as a laggard in the food
industry, slow to update facilities and products. The company's
dominance in the retail soup market has dropped in recent years and
Campbell has had trouble gaining an upper hand in the fast-growing
dry soup market.
   Campbell's fiscal 1989 earnings totaled $13 million, or 10 cents
per share, down sharply from a profit of $274.1 million, or $2.12 a
share, the previous year.
   The most recent results were reduced by $343 million as a result
of a restructuring in August that included the closing of
manufacturing plants in Camden, Maryland and Tennessee with a loss
of 2,800 jobs.
   In November, R. Gordon McGovern stepped down as Campbell's chief
executive officer and president after heading the nation's largest
soup maker for nine years. A two-man interim management team was
appointed to oversee day-to-day operations, but a replacement has
not been named.
   Ms. Harden said the dissenting family members may have
difficulty finding a prospective buyer willing to pay top price for
Campbell.
   ``They're assuming it's somebody out there with deep pockets,''
she said. ``I'm not certain in this investment environment that
they're going to find an investor ... willing to pay the kind of
prices they're looking for.''

   Frigid weather in Florida and the Northeast
disrupted travel plans for many vacationers, putting a dent in one
of the busiest tourist weeks of the year in the central part of the
state, officials say.
   But hotels, theme parks and other attractions expect to make up
much of the lost business by year's end, with sunshine and
60-to-70-degree temperatures dissipating the effects of a Christmas
weekend freeze that tied up airports and highways.
   Hotel occupancy and attendance at attractions began picking up
rapidly Wednesday after drops earlier in the week.
   ``Between Christmas and New Year's it's usually a bonanza. But
this year, no,'' said Ron Caimano, general manager of the Embassy
Suites hotel in Orlando.
   He said the hotel was only about 75 percent occupied Tuesday
because of cancellations.
   Northern visitors normally overflow attractions such as Walt
Disney World, the Kennedy Space Center and Busch Gardens during
this school-holiday week. Theme parks reported good crowds, but not
the usual long waiting lines, at the start of the week.
   Cathy Sauer, a spokeswoman for the newly opened 758-room Walt
Disney World Swan hotel, said, ``We had more cancellations that we
expected, more than is traditional'' for Disney hotels.
   Frigid weather in the eastern part of the country might have
forced some travelers to stay home, said John Rutherford, a
spokesman for the Orlando-Orange County Convention &amp; Visitors
Bureau Inc.
   Airports were temporarily closed in some areas of the state due
to the cold and ice, and Interstates 75 and 95 had to be closed for
a time over the weekend.
   Some theme park and hotel managers reported damage to
landscaping plants and plumbing from the weekend cold wave.
   The 1,500-room Marriott Orlando World Center hotel had to
contend with at least $10,000 in damage to foliage and water lines,
said General Manager Jim McDonnell. Many flowering annuals were
destroyed on its 200 acres and must be replaced, he said.
   At Boardwalk &amp; Baseball, spokeswoman Kim Sams said the park was
back to normal Tuesday after frozen pipes were repaired. It was
forced to close five hours Saturday and all day Sunday because of
power blackouts.
