<HEAD>Judge Blocks Enforcement of Wisconsin's Obscenity Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. district judge Monday barred the state
from enforcing its year-old anti-obscenity law, saying the language
of the statute was unconstitutionally vague.
   Wisconsin Attorney General Don Hanaway said he would appeal Judge
J.P. Statmueller's ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago.
   Hanaway said he had not seen the decision granting a preliminary
injunction, but he understood the judge ruled it was unclear whether
the law applied to simulated or actual sexual conduct. ``This was
not a major issue in the appeal'' by opponents of the law, Hanaway
said.
   ``We're going to have an obscenity law that is going to be
constitutional,'' Hanaway said. ``I think it would be wrong for
people to spend a bunch of money to reopen.''
   Hanaway said he understood some stores had closed following last
June's enactment of the law, which was intended to halt commercial
traffic in hard-core pornography.
   Two Milwaukee stores, Denmark Book store and Paradise Video
Store, and the Pure Pleasure II Bookstore in Oshkosh filed the
lawsuit against the state, calling the obscenity statute
unconstitutional.
   Prosecutors have held off enforcing the law while they awaiting
Statmueller's ruling. The law calls for jail terms of up to five
years and fines of up to $10,000 for pornography wholesalers.
   Under the statute, material is obscene if it lacks serious
literary, artistic, political, educational or scientific value.
   Stephen M. Glynn, the attorney representing the stores, called
the decision well-reasoned and said, ``We're very pleased by it.''
   But a sponsor of the legislation, Sen. Joseph Andrea, said he was
disappointed by Stadtmueller's decision.
   He and Sen. Water J. Chilsen were ``very careful when we put this
(the law) together to address the constitutional concerns,'' Andrea
said. Chilsen was the chief sponsor of the bill.
   Stadtmueller said the law was unconstitutionally vague. Among
other issues, the judge said it was difficult to determine whether
the law was violated by pictures or by descriptions of sexually
explicit conduct, or by both.
   In addition, Stadtmueller said the state violated the equal
protection clause of the Constitution by exempting libraries,
schools and universities from prosecution under the statute.
   The law would allow a library to commercially distribute obscene
materials without the threat of prosecution, but does not allow an
adult bookstore to do the same, the judge said.

<HEAD>Man Who Threatened Red Sox Slugger Gets 25 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who held a knife to the throat of
Boston Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs outside a bar was sentenced
Monday to 25 years in prison.
   George Young Jr., 23, pleaded no contest to two charges of
aggravated battery and one count of burglary in the Dec. 28
incident, which left Boggs with a slight cut on his neck. A
no-contest plea is not an admission of guilt but can be used as such
for the purpose of sentencing.
   Under sentencing guidelines, Young faced three years in prison.
   But because he had been out of prison less than three months
before the December attacks, Assistant State Attorney Ralph Grabel
asked acting Circuit Judge J. Edward Philman to use state law to go
well above the recommended sentence.
   Philman said his sentence was based more on the violence of the
crime than the stature of Boggs, an All-Star third baseman and one
of baseball's top hitters.
   ``The fact that he had been released so recently on a violent
crime and then went out and committed another even more violent
crime, I determined him to be a danger to society,'' Philman said
after the sentencing.
   Young fell well within the the requirements for an extended
sentence since he had been released in September from prison on a
1985 conviction of aggravated battery with a firearm and a later
escape charge, Grabel said.
   Philman sentenced Young to 15 years on the aggravated battery of
Boggs and another 10 years in prison for the assault on Stephen
Minardi, a passenger in Boggs' jeep who attempted to help the
athlete.
   The judge ordered Young to serve an additional five years on
probation for a burglary charge related to entering Bogg's jeep
during the assault.
   According to police reports of the incident, Boggs was inside his
vehicle showing his friends a handgun when Young and another man
began talking to Boggs.
   The men left, but a short time later pulled up in a vehicle and
parked in front of Boggs' Jeep, blocking him. When a passenger in
Boggs' vehicle got out to talk to the men, Young brandished a knife.
   Police say Young got into Boggs' vehicle, holding the knife to
the baseball player's throat while threatening to kill him.

   One problem Alabama shared with other states was allowing doctors
to practice on inmates even when not licensed to treat the public.
It was the first state to hire a private company that used fully
licensed doctors to provide medical care in its prisons; now all or
part of care in 29 states comes from private providers.
   ``The norm 15 years ago was a broken-down doctor with an
institutional license, someone who couldn't practice on the outside
because he was too old, too sick or an alcoholic,'' said Dr. Jay
Anno of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care.
   About the same time the courts began correcting ills, health
groups were seeking reform, reacting to conditions exposed by
several prison disorders, including the 1971 riot at Attica, N.Y.
   What evolved was the National Commission on Correctional Health
Care, which determined 71 minimum things prisons should provide.
About 60 prisons have met the standards since 1982.
   The guidelines include medical screening of all incoming inmates,
daily access to sick call, 24-hour nursing care for inpatients, and
requiring uniform licensing and regulation of doctors, nurses and
other staff.
   While most states now assure their prison physicians are properly
licensed, problems with doctors persist.
   In the hiring competition, many prisons turn to doctors from
foreign medical schools who struggle with English.
   ``That doesn't necessarily mean they're quacks. Their English is
terrible, and they have a hard time communicating,'' said William
Rold of the Prisoners Rights Project in New York.
   Doctors in prison may also be treating ailments for which they
have no training. In the 1970s, a gynecologist did dental exams at
Bedford Hills, the Prisoners Rights Project said. In another New
York prison, a pathologist practiced general medicine, and a
pediatrician served as an internist.
   Salaries are one of the biggest barriers to attracting doctors.
   Hawaii, for example, pays prison doctors $35,000 a year, about
half what they could earn outside. One-third of the nursing slots in
Hawaii's prisons are unfilled.
   ``What doctor in his right mind would want to practice medicine
for civil-service pay under harsh conditions for a group of patients
that doesn't like or trust him?'' said Curtis Prout, director of the
internship program at Harvard Medical School.
   Added Dr. Ronald Shansky, medical director of the Illinois prison
system: ``No one goes to medical school and says, `Boy, when I get
out, I'm going to go to a prison and make my mark.'''

   It was bad enough Antti Haavisto coughed
up blood in his prison cell all night. He also had to listen to
death threats from neighboring inmates kept sleepless by the
diseased man's ceaseless hacking.
   ``Hurry up and die,'' convicts snarled through the steel bars
inside Stillwater Prison in eastern Minnesota. ``Shut up or we'll
shut you up.''
   Haavisto's lungs were being consumed by tuberculosis, which
remained undiagnosed through 11 visits to sick call over six months
in 1982. Prison doctors failed to spot the TB on two X-rays;
although Haavisto was coughing up sputum with the consistency of
sludge, the doctors told him he had emphysema or pneumonia and gave
him cough drops to ease the hacking.
   ``I thought I was going to die. I couldn't get air in, and I
couldn't cough that mud out. I almost drowned twice,'' said the
wheezing Haavisto, a Finnish immigrant convicted of manslaughter.
   ``Before I'd go to eat, I tried to cough up enough stuff so I
didn't bother anyone. I was afraid they would hate me and beat me
up,'' Haavisto, 64, said in an interview.
   Even after Haavisto was diagnosed and released from prison in May
1983, the air-borne germ stalked the Stillwater cellblocks.
   One year after Haavisto's diagnosis, the prisoner in the next
cell came down with TB. An outbreak occurred in 1984, when inmates
sued the prison for deficient medical care, and another rash of
infections hit in 1986, when the entire prison was finally tested.
   Ultimately, one-third of the 1,200 inmates and at least five
guards were infected.
   Tuberculosis is a bacterial lung disease once known as
consumption because it eats away lung tissue. Scientists estimate 10
million Americans are infected, but the vast majority will never get
the disease.
   TB is far worse in crowded prisons. Lawyers and inmate advocates
say TB outbreaks show what can happen when a contagious disease
infects a closed environment with antiquated ventilation systems and
inattentive medical watchdogs.
   The incidence of TB among prisoners is more than triple the rate
of those not in jail, according to a May report by the federal
Centers for Disease Control. In New Jersey, the rate is 11 times
higher for inmates; in California, six times higher. New York
prisons had a sevenfold increase in the disease in the 10-year
period ending in 1986.
   The CDC recommended these corrective measures for prisons: TB
tests at least once a year, quick X-rays for inmates showing
symptoms and isolation of those infected.
   In Minnesota, federal Judge Diana Murphy said the handling of the
epidemic by prison officials and the state Department of Health
``evidenced a lack of care or reckless disregard for the medical
needs of inmates.''
   In January, five years after the lawsuit was filed, she ruled
that conditions had improved and there was no need to order
corrective actions.
   Nevertheless, she severely criticized prison administrators,
saying they ``passed off responsibility to Department of Health,
which assigned reponsibility to the doctors, who denied any role in
managing the crisis other than providing primary care.''
   ``It was a shocking case of negligence,'' said Stephen Miles of
the University of Chicago's Center for Clinical Medical Ethics.
``Prisoners were not only incarcerated but negligently exposed to a
contagious disease.''
   ``The prison became a pest hole of tuberculosis infection. Not
only was there neglect, prison officials turned a blind eye to known
facts. There was recklessness,'' said Arlo Vandevegte, attorney for
the inmates who sued the state.
   Haavisto apparently brought the TB with him into Stillwater. On
his trips to sick call, he even suggested the medical staff check
for TB.
   ``I told them I think I got some real bad problem. I couldn't
talk. I couldn't even make a phone call it was so bad,'' Haavisto
said. ``I said I got to get out of this hole or I'm going to die in
here.''
   Inmate Tony DeGidio contracted TB during the epidemic. His father
caught it when he came to the prison to visit Tony.
   ``You're trapped. You don't have a way out,'' DeGidio said. ``We
used to tell the guards to do something. This guy's got a problem.
Treat it or we're going to treat it our way. Eliminate him.''
   Prison officials say treatment and tracking have improved.
   ``We don't have those problems now,'' said LeRoy Siegel,
executive assistant to Stillwater's warden. ``We responded the way
the so-called experts told us to.''

<TEXT>
   To the United States, the Panama
Canal is a marvel of American know-how, a symbol of the strength and
ingenuity that made it a power.
   To a generation of Panamanians, the canal is merely emblematic of
American domination.
   ``The canal has been a curse for Panama,'' said Maj. Edgardo
Lopez, a spokesman for the Panamanian Defense Forces. ``Sometimes I
think we would have been better off barefoot, eating bananas _ but
without this canal.''
   In 1978, the United States finally agreed to turn over the Canal
Zone and its military installations to Panama by 1999. Meanwhile,
the Panamanians will assume greater administrative control.
   For Latin Americans, the agreement was one of the most
significant developments of the century and the centerpiece of a
more open U.S. policy in the region.
   The violation of that accord ``would create a grave crisis,''
said Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, even though he is no
friend of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The president has backed the
U.S. effort to oust Noriega, Panama's Defense Forces commander and
de facto ruler.
   The controversy over canal dates back to the founding of Panama
in 1903, when Panamanians accepted a treaty that gave the United
States permanent rights to a zone 10 miles wide across the center of
Panama.
   In essence, Panama was exchanging the Canal Zone for help in
gaining independence from Colombia. At the time, it seemed worth the
trade.
   Secretary of State John Hay wrote a friend at the time that the
treaty was ``vastly advantageous to the United States,'' according
to David McCullough's book, ``The Path Between the Seas.''
   Panamanian objections were outweighed by a desire to profit from
the immense U.S. construction effort that ended in 1914, according
to Materno Vasquez, an aide to former leader Gen. Omar Torrijos
during the treaty negotiations.
   Vasquez said it was not until 1935 that nationalists began to
refer to the Canal Zone as a ``colonialist enclave.''
   He said many Panamanians resented the ``gold'' and ``silver''
canal payrolls _ the higher gold for Americans and white
Panamanians, the silver for dark-skinned Panamanians.
   By 1964, resentment had festered to the point where it fueled
riots that left 20 Panamanians and four U.S. soldiers dead.
   Vasquez said Torrijos, who controlled Panama from 1968 until his
death in 1981, viewed the effort to recover the zone as his
generation's historical mission.
   In his book ``Keeping Faith,'' Jimmy Carter, who agreed as
president to the 1978 pact, said he felt the old arrangement was
unjust and was driving a wedge between Panama and the United States.
   Nevertheless, Carter said he did not understand the strength of
Panamanian feelings until Torrijos, reading a statement at the
signing of the new pact, broke down and sobbed.
   In addition, the canal's strategic value has dropped because the
U.S. Navy has grown and need not move as often between the oceans.
Its economic importance has been diminished by air travel,
interstate highways, and oil pipelines.
   Many Americans, however, bitterly opposed the new agreement. They
saw the canal as vital to American security, and some suggested
Panamanians would be unable to run it.
   Ronald Reagan gave a lightning rod to opponents with the phrase
``we built it'' during his successful run for Carter's job in 1980.
   The U.S. Senate ratified the new treaties in spring 1978 by 68
votes, only one more than the required two-thirds majority.
   The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Commission, with five
U.S. and four Panamanian members. Though the administrator for this
year is an American, a Panamanian is supposed to succeed him.
   That may be a sticking point because the United States is
unlikely to approve a Noriega nominee. The canal could be run
temporarily by a U.S. deputy administrator.
   For his part, Noriega never loses a chance to say the United
States wants to keep the canal. However, both his enemies and
friends say he sincerely believes in a historical mission of taking
over the canal.
   In the United States, ironically, it is Noriega's leadership that
has given rise to new talk in Congress and elsewhere about
abrogating the canal agreements. Noriega has been indicted on U.S.
drug-running charges, and both the Bush and Reagan administrations
have tried to pressure him out of office.
   ``I think it's inconceivable that the American people, directly
or through a marionette, would allow Noriega to appoint an
administrator for the canal,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., in
early May.
   The United States, moreover, has military options it could use.
U.S. troops, who now number about 14,000, would leave in 1999 under
the treaties. However, Congress says it has reserved the right to
defend the canal with U.S. soldiers if necessary.
   The United States last flexed its muscles in May, sending about
2,000 more combat troops to the canal after Noriega voided a
national election.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said
Sunday he will tell Contra commanders this week that if they want to
lay down arms and return to Nicaragua, ``they should be encouraged''
to do so.
   The vice president, beginning a three day journey to four Central
American countries, said, however, that he will present that only as
one option the Contras might choose as the United States and Latin
heads of state seek a diplomatic rather than military solution to
the Contra war against Nicaragua's leftist government.
   Quayle also indicated he does not have much faith in Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega's promise to hold free elections next
February as required by the regional peace plan, but said e would
not use those doubts to encourage the Contras to hang on for the
possibility of renewed U.S. military aid.
   Asked by reporters aboard Air Force Two en route from Washington
whether he would tell the Contras to return to Nicaragua to
participate in the political process, Quayle said, `I'm not going to
do that. But I'm certainly going to lay that out as an option. And
if they feel comfortable, they should be encouraged to go back.''
   He added, `I don't think it would be proper for me to say this is
your only option.''
   Quayle is scheduled to meet with a handful of Contra field
commanders on Tuesday morning in Honduras. Their 11,000-member force
is camped out near the Nicaraguan border, supplied by U.S.
non-lethal aid.
   Quayle said he would underscore the need for the Contras to
refrain from military attacks during this period, a condition of the
U.S. aid package.
   He held out hope for fair elections in Nicaragua, but also voiced
skepticism, attacking Ortega and accusing him of already violating
terms of peace agreements. Of the Contra commanders, Quayle said, `I
don't have to tell them what Danny Ortega's track record is.''
   He mentioned specifically U.S. allegations that Nicaragua is
arming leftist rebels in El Salvador in violation of the regional
peace accords.
   Quayle said the purpose of his trip to Guatemala, Costa Rica, El
Salvador and Honduras is threefold:
   _To emphasize the importance of democracy in the region.
   _To ``get involved on a substantive basis'' with the presidents
of those U.S. allies before they and Ortega meet again in July to
further work on their peace plan.
   _To find out what the presidents think they can to to help
pressure Panamanian leader Manuel ANtonio Noriega from power, which
is the Bush administration's foremost goal in Panama.
   Quayle was scheduled to meet Monday morning with political and
community leaders in Guatemala before seeing President Vinicio
Cerezo, and then fly on to Honduras.
   Cerezo told reporters last week he expected to discuss a variety
of topics with Quayle, including U.S. trade policies and economic
and military aid. The United States has important military and
economic relationships with each of the countries Quayle will visit.
   Cerezo specifically mentioned as topics of discussion:
   _U.S. import quotas, especially on textiles. He said they would
directly affect the small local textile industry the Guatemalan
government is encouraging.
   _Faster disbursement of $80 million approved in balance of
payments support for Guatemala.
   _Reservations from some congressional quarters about continued
U.S. military aid.
   Quayle will be in El Salvador for less than a day at a time when
the country is gripped by a new wave of violence in its nine-year
civil war. His trip is intended in large part to show support for
the new government of rightist President Alfredo Cristiani, who was
inaugurated on June 1.
   Quayle met with Cristiani when he was a candidate for president
in early February, and again when Cristiani visited Washington as
president-elect.
   Cristiani's closest adviser, Cabinet minister Jose Antonio
Rodriquez Porth, was gunned down along with two bodyguards on Friday
in an attack Cristiani blamed on leftist rebels.
   Quayle is to deliver the president's condolences to the Rodriquez
Porth family and Cristiani.
   Despite concerns from some on Capitol Hill and other critics that
the government of Cristiani's Arena party will give rise to a new
wave of death squad violence and human rights violations, U.S.
officials have said Cristiani deserves a chance to prove his
pro-human rights statements.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposed savings and loan
bailout plan moves to the House floor this week with members of his
own party attacking its key reform and Democrats trying to use it to
create new housing subsidies.
   With the S&amp;L crisis already expected to cost taxpayers $600 to
$1,000 for every man, woman and child in the country, what has been
a largely harmonious effort so far could deteriorate into partisan
name-calling.
   Omens of what might occur when debate begins Wednesday were
evident last week in several confrontations between Democrats and
Republicans, Sun Belt and Frost Belt lawmakers, and populists and
industry sympathizers.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said what happens will be the first
test of bipartisan cooperation since his party lost two of its three
top leaders to ethics problems.
   ``We're fully cognizant that this is President Bush's
initiative,'' he said. ``However, the Republicans are more
interested in weakening the president's own bill. We are not going
to allow the Republican (Congressional) Campaign Committee to
criticize Democrats for trying to help a Republican initiative.''
   The Senate, meanwhile, is expected to spend most of the week
debating a bill to lift the remaining government price controls on
natural gas.
   Only about one-third of the nation's supply of the fuel is still
under the federal price ceilings. Experts generally agree that
prices to consumers will not rise immediately from total decontrol
because current market prices are well below the federal ceiling.
   However, many acknowledge that natural gas prices could rise in
the 1990s as demand for it increases, particularly if oil prices
continue rising and new environmental controls are put on coal.
   Back in the House, Democrats this week hope to complete
rebuilding the leadership ranks devastated by ethics questions that
felled former Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and Majority Whip Tony
Coelho of California.
   With Thomas S. Foley of Washington now installed as speaker,
Democrats on Wednesday meet to fill the No. 2 and No. 3 party
leadership slots in the House.
   Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., are vying for
Foley's old post of majority leader.
   Reps. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., and
David Bonior, D-Mich., are competing for the whip's position, which
Coelho will vacate upon the naming of a replacement.
   Wright's and Coelho's downfall were due in part to charges they
peddled their influence to S&amp;L operators in opposing higher federal
deposit insurance fees on the industry while raising campaign money
for Democratic candidates.
   House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia threatened last week to
use this week's debate to ``talk about how the mess got so big and
who was responsible'' after Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, called Bush's
S&amp;L plan ``the biggest tax increase in recent memory.''
   The biggest fight will be over new capital requirements for the
industry. Republicans are resisting the key reform measure in Bush's
package _ a requirement that S&amp;L owners put more of their own money
at risk when making speculative loans.
   Democrats, meanwhile, want to make the thrift industry pay $75
billion to $150 billion a year toward subsidizing below-market
mortgage rates for low-income homebuyers and rental housing.
   They also differ with Bush over the accounting for the bailout
program. The president has adamantly resisted allowing the S&amp;L
cleanup to show up in the federal deficit and thus bolster the case
for a tax increase. His proposal for getting around the problem is
floating $50 billion in private bonds and obligating taxpayers to
pay the $157 billion in interest costs on them over three decades.
   Democrats would finance the program through direct borrowing by
the Treasury in order to save some $4.5 billion through lower
interest rates.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois concedes Democrats
will probably win that vote as well as the one on housing subsidies.

<TEXT>
   With a sharp, no-nonsense crack, the gavel in
the hand of Chairman Dante Fascell hits the desk in the hearing room
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Displaying the bite, bark and manner of a grizzled drill
sergeant, the Florida Democrat is whipping a two-year, $11.5 million
foreign assistance bill into shape in long sessions that lasted for
days.
   Attendance at meetings is heavy; interest is apparently high.
   Shift the scene to the Senate.
   Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., enters the hearing room of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee promptly at 10 a.m. and seats
himself in the center of the horseshoe-shaped bench.
   The chairs to his right and left are empty.
   But Pell is determined to get to work on a bill authorizing $4.5
billion in spending for the State Department and its sister agencies.
   Pell, the gracious, self-effacing possessor of a distinguished
family heritage dating to colonial times, waits patiently for absent
senators to arrive.
   Nearly 50 minutes later he shrugs, then gloomily announces the
session cannot proceed for lack of a quorum.
   There is, he declares wryly, ``a profound lack of interest in
this bill.''
   The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, once pointed to as a
summit of legislative prestige, influence and power, is caught in a
state of inertia that borders at times on stalemate.
   Last week the committee floundered through a political dispute
over a controversial ambassadorial appointment and finally,
surmounting a Republican boycott of all its committee meetings,
approved the State Department authorization bill.
   But even that action left key spending decisions uncertain and
unresolved.
   Donald Gregg, the nominee to be ambassador to South Korea, is the
target of a Democratic probe of allegations _ which he denies _ that
he used a former position as national security adviser to Vice
President Bush to help the illegal resupply of the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   The GOP boycott, organized by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was
mounted in the conviction that Democrats were attempting to stir
anew the fading embers of the Iran-Contra affair and sink the Gregg
nomination in a morass of ``delays and leaks.''
   McConnell called off the boycott after Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., agreed to let the Gregg nomination come to a vote on June
20.
   With the gridlock caused by the dispute over Gregg cleared away,
the panel was able to consider and approve the State Department bill.
   But debate was muddied by a tug of war over two competing
spending priorities: the construction in Israel of two expensive
broadcasting transmitters for the Voice of America _ a course
favored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. _ and the payment of millions of
dollars of past-due payments to the United Nations, a course favored
by Chairman Pell.
   The panel decided that the transmitters should be funded but that
the money should not be taken out of the U.N. account as Helms had
demanded. No one said where the money would come from in a foreign
affairs account that is already nearly $800 million over budget
ceilings.
   The committee tried to return to the larger and more potentially
controversial foreign aid bill on Friday.
   But once again, no quorum could be mustered.
   The panel will try again this week.
   Many observers say that the panel's strongest member is not its
chairman but Helms who, as the ranking GOP member, is the architect
of his own highly conservative, highly anti-communist foreign policy.
   Pell has held firm against Helms' determined and imaginative
tactics and the North Carolinian has more than once growled, ``Don't
you try to railroad me, Mr. Chairman.''
   Helms fiercely opposed Senate ratification of the U.S.-Soviet
medium-range missile treaty two years ago. During the panel's
lengthy consideration of it, senior Democrats made sure one or all
of them were present to rebut his assertions and attempt to overcome
his tactics.
   Helms also has engaged in a long-running battle with the State
Department, drawing criticism for allegedly delaying diplomatic
nominations in order to gain leverage in battles to shape foreign
policy.
   The committee, many of its critics say, has seen brighter days.
   The names of such postwar chairman as Arthur Vandenburg of
Michigan, J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and Frank Church of Idaho
have been central to the shaping of American foreign policy.
   The committee's influence has been slipping since Fulbright's
chairmanship in the early 1970s with the exception of a brief
renaissance when Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., headed the panel for
two years beginning in 1985.
   During the Lugar years, foreign-aid legislation marched with
unaccustomed ease through the Congress, a consensus was won on
controversial sanctions against white-ruled South Africa, and Lugar
helped change U.S. policy toward dictatorial rule in the Philippines.
   But that was a brighter-than-usual period in the committee's long
decline.
   Over the years other committees have chipped away at the panel's
jurisdiction.
   Non-members often have taken the lead in foreign policy
initiatives.
   And many foreign policy issues now are shaped not in the
committee, but when they reach the Senate floor.

<HEAD>Congress Told Aid to Third World Farms Helps US Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advisers to Congress are pushing aid to Third
World farmers on the premise that the more food they produce, the
more food their countries will buy from this country.
   According to a special study by the Congressional Budget Office,
the seeming contradiction works this way:
   As Third World farmers increase their output, their countries'
growth speeds up too. More growth means higher incomes, especially
when Third World governments raise the prices they pay to their
farmers, as many are now doing. In most of those countries, unlike
the United States, a huge proportion of people still live in the
country _ including the poorest people.
   They not only grow food, they also have to buy some. As they earn
more they buy more, and they buy a greater variety: poor people
spend a larger part of their income on food than the more prosperous
do. And in some countries the population is growing faster than home
production.
   ``In many cases, the demand for food grows faster than the supply
of food, resulting in greater food imports,'' says the report,
written by Stephen Parker of the CBO's Natural Resources and
Commerce Division.
   That view has important support in Congress.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt, chairman of the Agriculture
Committee, said the report ``underscores what seems like a real
paradox: that we help U.S. farmers by helping Third World
agriculture. ... If we ignore this in setting our aid, trade and
macroeconomic policies, we are just shooting ourselves in the foot.''
   ``Like all general rules this one has its exceptions. We should
not ignore these _ but don't let the exceptions blind us to where
our U.S. interests lie,'' Leahy said.
   Some U.S. farmers see Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay as among the
leading exceptions, countries where farmers have had direct or
indirect aid from the United States. They have become important
competitors in one of the most lucrative U.S. crops: soybeans.
   ``Concerns have arisen in the American agricultural community
over how U.S. assistance may benefit Third World economies to the
detriment of U.S. farmers,'' said Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Tex., chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.
   ``But where assistance, directly from the U.S. or through
multilateral institutions has been provided and resulted in new
competition for the U.S., it has also led to an increase in that
country's economic and income growth.''
   Between 1970 and 1985, U.S. sales of farm products to Third World
countries grew from $2.4 billion to $12.7 billion.
   The report says that on average people in the Third World consume
35 percent fewer calories and 40 percent less protein than Americans.
   ``The huge potential consumption among these 3 billion people
will become actual as their incomes rise,'' the report predicts.
   Because the office represents both parties in Congress, it made
no specific recommendations. But it said recent U.S. government
reviews suggest that current American aid is not effectively helping
poor countries to develop. It gave figures that show the Bush
administration seeking less aid for farm development abroad this
year that President Reagan sought in 1987.
   For countries in Asia and the Middle East, the requested figure
was $174.2 million compared with $237.9 million in 1987. The total
for Latin America was down to $144.5 million from $178.8 million.
   Some members of Congress have called such amounts so small as to
have a negligible effect and are working on a complete
reorganization of U.S. aid programs. Additional money for farmers
comes from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and
others to which the United States is a major contributor.

<HEAD>More Than Two-Thirds of Foreign Wheat Sales Subsidized</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Export subsidies have been almost as important
as rain to the American wheat farmer in recent years.
   Since Congress authorized the subsidies in the 1985 farm law, the
program has cost more than $2.5 billion and has accounted for about
two-thirds of all U.S. wheat sold to foreign buyers.
   According to one Agriculture Department analyst, the subsidies
provided by the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, may have boosted
the U.S. price of wheat by a much as a fifth through the larger
volume of shipments.
   The Soviet Union and China have been the biggest beneficiaries of
the subsidized sales, but about two dozen other countries also have
shared in the program.
   Soviet wheat purchases under EEP since the program began totaled
17.1 million tons through May 5, representing 28 percent of the 60.6
million tons shipped to all countries designated for the cut-rate
grain.
   China, with purchases of 12.3 million tons, has accounted for
about 20 percent of the EEP wheat total.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Under the program, private exporters can sell wheat (or other
designated commodities) to an eligible country at prices lower than
otherwise would be charged. The main purpose of EEP is to allow U.S.
grain to compete with subsidized exports by the European Economic
Community, the 12-nation trading bloc that is also known as the
Common Market.
   The exporters then collect a ``bonus'' or subsidy to make up for
the reduced price charged to the foreign buyer. The subsidies are in
the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's Commodity
Credit Corp.
   A debate has raged within the Bush administration and in Congress
on whether the subsidy program has been worth it. Farm advocates say
EEP is necessary and has helped drive some countries, including the
Common Market, to the bargaining table on trade negotiations.
   New studies have been ordered to help sort out the good and bad
about EEP, including one being put together by the department's
economics staff. That report, however, is still waiting on final
clearance.
   Meanwhile, the department's Economic Research Service has
circulated a new theoretical computer study that includes an
evaluation of EEP and its impact on U.S. wheat prices and exports.
   The highly technical computer study, by economist Stephen L.
Haley, includes several ``scenarios'' of possibilities based on the
1986-87 crop year. A central part of the study involves pitting the
U.S. subsidy system against the European Common Market's program of
export subsidies or ``restitution'' prices.
   Haley noted that there ``has been a dramatic turnaround'' in U.S.
wheat exports the past two years. After bottoming out at 24.9
million metric tons in the 1985-86 crop year, export volume increase
by more than 9 percent to 27.3 million tons in 1986 and by 59
percent to 43.3 million tons in 1987-88.
   The U.S. share of the world wheat market increase to more than 41
percent in 1987-88 from 31 percent in 1986-87. At the same time, he
said, the U.S. wheat inventory declined by 30 percent, a sign of
export growth.
   Haley said a number of factors have been involved in the export
surge, including changes in U.S. farm policy, lower price support
loan rates provided by the 1985 farm law, a steady level of target
prices used to compute government payments to growers, and the
export subsidy program.
   ``Other factors contributing to the turnaround included a
depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar and production
shortfalls outside the United States,'' he said. ``A problem for
policy makers has been to sort out the relative contribution of each
of these factors to the turnabout.''
   Haley said that ``depending on one's interpretation'' of the
European Economic Community's motivation for its own export subsidy
program, the U.S. subsidies ``have likely increased the U.S. price
of wheat between 7 percent and 22 percent, U.S. wheat export volume
between 10 percent and 31 percent, and U.S. wheat export revenue
between 18 percent and 61 percent.''
   In another finding, the computer study showed that the European
bloc ``would be a wheat importer, rather than export'' without its
system of export subsidies.
   ``The scenarios imply that the EEC's comparative disadvantage in
world wheat trade makes it extremely vulnerable to policies of the
United States and to currency realignments,'' Haley said. ``This
vulnerability helps explain why the EEC attempts to insulate itself
from shocks affecting the world wheat market.''

   George Bush turns 65 today, only the 13th
president in U.S. history to hit that milestone while in office.
   Friends and experts say they don't expect his new status as
senior citizen to slow down Bush, a trim non-smoker who jogs and
plays tennis regularly.
   ``I've known him for a long time and I've never seen him look
better,'' says White House physician Burton Lee. ``Aging is
different in all of us and certainly exercise retards it.''
   Dr. T. Franklin Williams, director of the National Institute on
Aging, says, ``I don't know anything at all about President Bush's
medical history, but just to observe him from a distance I would
predict he has 25 or 30 good years ahead of him anyhow.''
   Bush appears to have both the actuarial tables and genes on his
side.
   The president's mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, is 87 and living in
Greenwich, Conn. His father, the late Sen. Prescott Bush, died in
1972 at age 77.
   Bush is just one of 4,000 Americans turning 65 today _ and for
that matter, every day of the year.
   There are 31 million Americans 65 or older now, and there will be
35{ million by the end of the 1990s.
   A growing segment of them are living to truly advanced old ages.
Williams said the number of American centenarians, now around
25,000, will exceed 100,000 by the turn of the century.
   Perhaps because he followed the oldest president in U.S. history,
Ronald Reagan, little attention has been paid to Bush's age.
   He is 13 years younger than Reagan, who was 77 when he exited the
Oval Office.
   But at 64, Bush was the fourth oldest man ever inaugurated,
behind Reagan (69), William Henry Harrison (68), and James Buchanan
(65).
   He now is junior to only a dozen presidents, including George
Washington, who was nine days past his 65th birthday when he
finished his two terms, Thomas Jefferson, who was almost 66, and
Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was 70.
   If 65 was once the demarcation point of old age, it is no longer
clearly so.
   The average life expectancy for a man turning 65 is 15 years to
80, and for a woman 18.9 years, or almost 84. Life expectancy at
birth is somewhat lower: 71.7 for men and 78.3 for women.
   ``I don't think old age means very much to an awful lot of
people,'' Williams said in an interview. ``There's no inevitable
decline with aging.''
   ``We have lots of good research data showing many people live
into their 90s in very good health and functioning,'' he said.
``Humans who have a reasonably good lifestyle and are fortunate
enough not to have one of the major diseases ... can be essentially
as functional in their 80s and 90s as young people.''
   Williams, who is 67, got a cartoon from his secretary on his 40th
birthday ``showing a mountain and a person walking down the far side
of it.''
   ``I think that was an exaggeration. I think the same thing can be
said about 65 now. It's not really the
going-down-the-backside-of-the-mountain that we once thought it
was,'' he said.
   Sixty-five is still the age at which retired workers can first
draw their full Social Security benefits and Medicare hospital
insurance.
   Bush can't draw Social Security because of his $200,000 salary as
president.
   Social Security recipients will lose $1 in benefits for every $2
in earnings above $9,360 in 1990. The maximum someone born in 1924
and retiring this year can get from Social Security is $899 a month.
   Although Bush gets all the free medical care he wants, he could
elect to file for Medicare now. If he fails to do so within three
months of his 65th birthday, he may wind up having to pay stiffer
premiums in later life for Medicare's doctor coverage.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said he wasn't sure
what the president's plans were for Social Security.
   He was spending the milestone birthday unveiling a sweeping
proposal to clean up the nation's polluted air, then hopping aboard
Air Force One to visit one of America's most pristine settings, the
Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.

<HEAD>US Officials Suspect Increased Cuban Involvement in Drug Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South American drug dealers have been making
increasing use of Cuban air space and territorial waters for
U.S.-bound narcotics deliveries, an activity that U.S. officials say
strongly suggests the collaboration of Cuban authorities.
   Cuba is directly in the flight path between Colombia and south
Florida and the number of suspicious northbound flights through
Cuban airspace has gone up over the past several months, according
to administration officials.
   The Coast Guard also has detected an increase in air drops of
drugs into Cuban territorial waters. The cargo is then picked up by
speedboats for delivery to U.S. ports, the officials said.
   ``Over the past six months, there have been increasing reports of
specific incidents,'' one official said.
   The Cuban diplomatic mission here said it ``totally rejects'' the
charges and the ``unserious way'' in which they were made by U.S.
officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The allegations were made, a Cuban spokesman said, ``without any
proof or foundation.'' He added that it was part of a campaign to
discredit Cuba that the United States has waged for years.
   Allegations of Cuban involvement in drug smuggling have
circulated for years and U.S. officials acknowledge their suspicions
of an increase in this activity are largely circumstantial.
   The officials said the way Cuban society is organized, it is
inconceivable that Cuban authorities could be involved without the
knowledge of officials at the highest level.
   The suspicions of U.S. officials were reinforced by recent
testimony by two Colombians who face long U.S. prison terms for drug
smuggling. They said that large shipments of cocaine were flown on
two occasions in 1987 from Colombia to an airfield in Cuba and then
were sent to Florida aboard vessels.
   According to the testimony, both of the shipments contained 1,000
pounds of cocaine. The first was seized by U.S. Customs agents. The
two Colombians are expected to be sentenced in Florida later this
month.
   Another official said increasing numbers of planes _ an average
of about three a week _ that cross Cuba have been spotted but added
that it is not clear whether this represents a net growth or simply
an improvement in U.S. detection.
   He said U.S. monitoring operations have been able to observe
airdrops by planes to fast boats within Cuban territorial waters.
Once the vessels are loaded, they ``mill around'' Cuban waters,
awaiting the departure of Coast Guard boats stationed in the
adjacent U.S. waters.
   Eventually, the U.S. vessels get called away, leaving the coast
clear for the drug boat to head for Florida unimpeded, the official
said.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, has been encouraging the
administration to enlist Cuba's support in the fight against drug
smuggling.
   Based on talks late last year with Cuban leader Fidel Castro,
Rangel has said he is convinced Castro sincerely wants to cooperate.
Rangel was outraged several months ago when the administration
refused to give a visa to the mayor of Havana to take part in an
anti-drug conference in New York City.
   Castro has often contrasted Cuba's drug-free society with the
millions in the United States who suffer from narcotics addiction.
   U.S. officials have told Rangel that it would be unseemly for the
United States to seek cooperation from a government which the
administration believes is actively involved in the drug trade.
   ``If they have anything (evidence of drug smuggling) and want to
show it to us, we would welcome it,'' one official said.
   Jose Blandon, a former top adviser to the Panamanian government
who used to make official trips to Cuba on behalf of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, told Congress in February 1988 that Castro sees
narcotics smuggling as element of a broader anti-American strategy.
   Blandon said U.S. military involvement in Central America gave
Castro the ``moral justification to do anything against the United
States, anything that was necessary.''

   The mayor of South Lake Tahoe,
his wife and 16 other people have been arrested in connection with a
20-month undercover drug and money laundering investigation,
authorities said Sunday.
   Mayor Terry Trupp and his wife, Kim, were taken into custody
Sunday on federal conspiracy and money laundering charges involving
alleged efforts to launder about $750,000 to FBI and Internal
Revenue Service agents, the bureau and other agencies announced at a
joint news conference.
   The Trupps, who are being held without bail in an El Dorado
County jail, will be arraigned Monday before a federal magistrate.
   Besides the 18 arrested in the probe, dubbed ``Deep Snow,'' two
fugitives are being sought, South Lake Tahoe police and agents of
the FBI, IRS, and Drug Enforcement Administration said.
   All are suspected of being involved in drug trafficking or
efforts to launder money from drug sales, authorities said.
   Law enforcement officials have recovered about 12 kilograms of
cocaine in arrests and seizures, agents said. No drugs were seized
in the Trupps' arrests, authorities said.

   Perfect beach weather, you say? A great day to grab your towel,
shades, sunblock, the latest best seller and head for sandy shores?
   Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, a
virtual sand trap of rules and regulations awaits, governing such
things as your oceanside attire, what you pack in your cooler, even
whether you can toss a Frisbee.
   You think Fido might enjoy a romp in the waves? Sorry, but an
informal survey of beach restrictions on both coasts and some inland
beaches shows that most ban dogs, at least during the summer.
   ``Frankly, people just don't want to put their beach blankets
down next to a pile of deep doo-doo,'' said East Hampton Supervisor
Tony Bullock on New York's Long Island. Horses are prohibited, too.
   Wayne Shattaway, a lifeguard at Jacksonville Beach in Florida,
which even hired a dogcatcher to patrol the beach, said dogs can
sometimes be aggressive to strangers.
   ``Right now Rotweilers and Dobermans are the popular dogs here.
If there was just poodles on the beach, it wouldn't be a problem,''
he said.
   Bottles and glass containers are banned virtually everywhere,
restrictions on cans are almost as rampant, and if you're toting
anything stronger than soft drinks, that's likely to be forbidden,
too.
   ``The liquor, sun and surf just didn't mix,'' said John Crisp,
assistant chief of the Volusia County Beach Patrol, explaining why
the Florida county, which covers Daytona Beach, Ormond Beach, New
Smyrna Beach and Daytona Beach Shores, eliminated alcohol a few
years ago.
   Well, how about packing some hot dogs and having a barbecue?
   Open fires are banned on Virginia Beach, Va., Alabama's Gulf of
Mexico shoreline, California's Los Angeles County, and Long Island
and New Jersey beaches, to name a few. Cape Cod National Seashore in
Massachusetts bans fires without a permit. Wrightsville Beach, N.C.,
bans grills.
   ``A few years ago people would cook with charcoal on the beach
and then dump the hot charcoal in the sand and cover it up. Then
someone else would come walking along and step on it and ruin their
day,'' said Wrightsville Beach Police Chief George Antley.
   Frisbees are banned at Hilton Head Island, S.C., Long Island,
Virginia Beach, among other places.
   No ball playing of any kind on Ocean City, Md., beaches from 9
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. during the summer. No flotation devices _ inner
tubes, rafts and such _ on Rehoboth Beach, Del., or on the more than
10 miles of Lake Michigan beaches within Chicago's city limits.
   Los Angeles County beaches have a ``flying missile'' ordinance to
quell beer hurtling.
   Even President Bush's favorite pastime _ horseshoes _ is banned
at Hilton Head, according to Cynthia Harrison, a code enforcement
officer for the popular resort area.
   Most beaches have general rules banning nudity or indecent
exposure. But what is indecent is subject to debate.
   Thong bathing suits, swimsuits that expose the derriere, aren't
considered appropriate attire in North Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach
and the Isle of Palms, S.C.
   Thongs are OK on Hilton Head but T-shirts that say ``lifeguard''
are not, unless the wearer really is a lifeguard.
   Other rules include: No swimming in water deeper than your
shoulders in Myrtle Beach, no picking of flowers at Cape Cod
National Seashore, no radio playing without earphones on New York's
Jones Beach, and no swimming at Surfrider Beach, a surfing-only
beach in Malibu, Calif. Volleyball is allowed on Myrtle Beach, but
leaving the net up overnight will get you fined.
   Driving on the beach in a regular vehicle is prohibited almost
everywhere except where the beaches have hard-packed sand, such as
along the Washington coastline. But proposed legislation there will
probably ban that activity by next summer.
   Four-wheel drives and dune buggies are banned in many places for
environmental reasons, including sections of the Oregon coast, the
Florida Panhandle, some New Jersey communities and parts of Long
Island.
   Do all these restrictions make you want to tell somebody to go
fly a kite?
   That's a no-no in many places, too.

<HEAD>Daughter: Khomeini Suffered Five Heart Attacks Within Days of Cancer
Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was attended by up
to 40 doctors at a special clinic before his death, which followed
five heart attacks over a 10-day period, his daughter said in an
interview published today.
   Khomeini suffered the heart attacks following surgery for stomach
cancer May 23, said Zahra Mustafavi in an interview with The
Washington Post and Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun. Khomeini died June 3.
   The interview published in today's editions of the Post offered
the first public details of Khomeini's medical problems in the weeks
before his death.
   ``His trouble was heart attacks, which he had five times in that
10 days,'' said Mustafavi. She said that in his final days, Khomeini
was attended by as many as 40 doctors at a special clinic.
   Mustafavi said the Iranian ruler had been plagued by heart
troubles for years, suffering his first heart attack nine years ago.
His doctors took over the special clinic near his home in Tehran at
that time, she said.
   ``He almost died'' of a heart attack in 1986, Ms. Mustafavi said.
   She said Khomeini died at about 4 p.m. on June 3 after having his
last heart attack about an hour before.

<HEAD>Iceland Won't Stop Whaling Despite Greenpeace Boycott</HEAD>

<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iceland says it will never stop whaling
and will survive an international boycott launched by the
environmental group Greenpeace.
   ``We will never give it up, come hell or high water,'' Foreign
Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson said in an interview. ``It would
be the same as to underwrite our own verdict of execution.''
   Whaling is a tiny facet of the economy of this remote north
Atlantic island, and the vast majority of the 247,000 Icelanders
don't even like whale meat.
   But Iceland's existence depends on the sea, and the government
won't relinquish sovereignty over any of its natural resources.
   In February 1988, Greenpeace launched a boycott of Icelandic
fish, which accounts for 75 percent of the country's exports. The
anti-whaling campaign targeted three of Iceland's biggest markets:
the United States, West Germany and Britain.
   Ros Reeve, a Greenpeace campaigner who is in San Diego for
today's annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission,
estimated in a telephone interview that Iceland may have lost up to
$50 million worth of contracts.
   Hannibalsson said the boycott has forced the closure of several
fish processing and canning factories, mainly in sparsely populated
northern Iceland, and several hundred people have lost their jobs.
   Iceland says it has given up commercial whale hunting, but still
kills whales under a four-year research program approved by the
Whaling Commission that allowed it to kill 78 whales in 1988.
   Greenpeace contends the program is a cover for commercial
whaling, which the commission halted from 1986 to 1990 to preserve
endangered stocks.
   The hunt is being carried out by the commercial whaling company
and Iceland is selling whale meat to Japan, the environmental
organization says.
   Hannibalsson countered that the commission allows up to 49
percent of whale meat to be exported, and the sales financed the
scientific program.
   ``It is our sovereign right to carry out scientific research,
which is the basis for our fishing policy,'' Hannibalsson said in
the interview last week. He said researchers had counted more than
70,000 whales in Iceland's 200-mile economic zone.
   Ms. Reeve said the commission never intended scientific whaling
to include mass killings. She accused Iceland of using the loophole
to keep its whaling fleet intact pending the commission's review of
the moratorium in 1990.
   Fisheries Minister Halldor Asgrimsson has said it is unlikely
Iceland will go whaling in 1990.
   Greenpeace selected Iceland for the boycott because Iceland
created the precedent for scientific whaling, which was followed by
Japan and Norway, Ms. Reeve said.
   In the United States, she said, the Long John Silver seafood
chain canceled a $9 million contract, Burger King cut its buying by
20 percent, and Boston banned Icelandic fish in schools and
institutions.
   Though more than 80 percent of Icelanders supported the
government's position in a recent poll, Greenpeace has one powerful
supporter _ Gudrun Helgadottir, president of the Althing, Iceland's
parliament.
   ``Iceland has shamed itself in environmental affairs,'' she said.
``This has turned into a nationalistic cause, which is very
dangerous because it prevents you from debating the issue seriously
and rationally.''
   Hanniballson said Iceland would not be deterred.
   It survived a British quarantine on Icelandic cod by finding new
markets from 1956 to 1976, when London accepted Iceland's 200-mile
zone.
   ``We will survive this, too,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Actress Theresa Saldana's plea helped keep
the man who almost killed her locked up, but, despite public
outrage, notorious convicts have been freed from California prisons.
   Arthur Richard Jackson, who was set for a parole hearing
Thursday, instead was charged with eight felony counts for allegedly
issuing threats to kill Saldana. Conviction could keep him in prison
for seven more years, Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner says.
   But the ones released form a rogues' gallery familiar to most
Golden State residents, and many people across the country.
   There's Lawrence Singleton, who raped a hitchhiker and then
chopped off her forearms with an ax; Ted Streleski, who battered his
Stanford University professor to death, then refused to say he
wouldn't kill again; and Dan White, released after serving just a
few years for the assassinations of San Francisco's mayor and
another politician.
   These men and others symbolize for many Californians some of the
bigger problems with the state's penal code.
   Jackson, who had served seven years of a 12-year sentence for the
attack outside Saldana's West Hollywood home, was to be deported
after his parole.
   But after Saldana said she was terrified he might have returned
illegally to carry out threats to kill her, Reiner filed the charges
against Jackson.
   Saldana went on television talk shows to publicize the parole
hearing and won support from elected officials.
   But a storm of protest over White's release failed to stop it.
White, a former San Francisco city supervisor who shot and killed
Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk in City Hall in
1978, served fewer than seven years in prison. Shortly after his
release, he committed suicide.
   Many law enforcement officials, however, say public fears don't
necessarily reflect reality when it comes to freeing people like
Singleton, Jackson and White.
   ``With intensified supervision and special parole conditions, I
don't know of many situations where victims have been harassed after
a person has gotten out of prison,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Dick Iglehart.
   Some blame a 1977 state sentencing law for releasing some
criminals after serving relatively light sentences. The law stripped
the state Board of Prison Terms of much of its power to decide when
criminals should be released.
   One critic of the law is Alan Nudelman, deputy supervising
district attorney for Santa Clara County. He prosecuted Streleski.
   Though he never expressed remorse for killing a Stanford
professor in 1978, Streleski was a model prisoner during his seven
years behind bars. He refused parole three times, opting to serve
his complete sentence so there would be no restrictions on his
movements.
   A year after the convictions of Streleski and White, voters
approved an initiative calling for stiffer sentences for murder.
   Nudelman views the time between the two measures as a dark period
in the state's legal history.
   ``The whole determinate sentence scheme brought forth any number
of miscarriages of justice resulting in a great deal of public
outrage,'' he said. ``Someone like Streleski would never have gone
out, based on his lack of remorse and his attitude toward the body
politic in general.''
   Other releases that caused public outrage include:
   _ William Archie Fain served 16 years for the 1967 slaying of a
17-year-old boy and the rape of two teen-age girls. Fain was
released despite public protest and the objections of Gov. George
Deukmejian. Last year, he was arrested in connection with the attack
of a Hayward school teacher.
   _ ``Onion Field'' cop killer Jimmy Lee Smith was paroled in 1982
despite loud protests from police and the public. Last Wednesday,
Smith was sentenced to three months in jail on drug charges.
   Today, only a few crimes, including first- and second-degree
murder and kidnapping for the purpose of robbery, carry
indeterminate sentences.
   Although it seems a popular notion that California is lax on
criminals, sentencing laws are not dramatically different from those
elsewhere, said Robert Weisberg, a criminal law professor at
Stanford University.
   ``California just has more notorious criminals,'' he said.

   One quarter of U.S. households were the target
of a violent crime or theft last year, a figure similar to the three
previous years, according to the Justice Department.
   ``In 1988, 27 percent of households with incomes of $25,000 or
more, 29 percent of black households and 30 percent of urban
households were touched by crime,'' the report found.
   The report, based on the National Crime Survey, covered 92.9
million households and found that 22.8 million experienced a theft
or burglary or had a member who was raped, robbed or assaulted.
   The study also found that members of about 141,000 households
were raped, 872,000 were robbed and 3.7 million were assaulted, and
it said a total of 7.19 million households, or one in 13, were
targeted by crimes of ``high concern,'' including rape, robbery,
assault by a stranger or a burglar.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Military May Have Suppressed Vital Evidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor investigating the 1980 crash of an
Italian civilian jetliner that was downed by a missile or a bomb
told a magistrate that military officials may have suppressed vital
evidence.
   Deputy prosecutor Giorgio Santacroce contends officials at two
military radar centers may have destroyed essential radar tapes,
lied to investigators and illegally suppressed the truth.
   He asked Magistrate Vittorio Bucarelli on Saturday to notify the
officials they were under investigation in connection with the June
27, 1980 crash that killed all 81 people aboard.
   The DC-9 jetliner of the domestic carrier Itavia was on a flight
from Bologna to Palermo, Sicily, when an explosion sent it plunging
into the Tyrrhenian Sea.
   A commission of experts appointed by Bucarelli, who is in charge
of the investigation, concluded in March that the airliner was hit
by a missile fired by an unidentified warplane.
   However, another commission appointed by Premier Ciriaco De Mita
said last month that a bomb may have been smuggled aboard the
jetliner.
   Italian news agencies said Santacroce is investigating the
possibility that the commander of the military radar center at
Licola ordered the destruction of crucial radar tapes made the day
of the crash.
   The agencies said he also was considering charging 22 servicemen
at the radar centers at Licola and Marsala, Sicily, with suppression
of evidence, perjury or complicity.
   Santacroce told Bucarelli that there was a ``strong suspicion''
that key radar tapes had been altered.
   The prosecutor noted what he called an unexplained disappearance
from the monitor of radar tracks fundamental to the investigation,
and a ``hole'' of eight minutes in the tapes.
   Government officials, including Defense Minister Valerio Zanone,
have vigorously denied any government coverup of the disaster and
also have denied an Italian warplane could have been involved.
   The commission appointed by the premier also said it received
assurances from the Defense Ministry and NATO that no military
exercises were under way in the area at the time of the crash.
   It said the United States, France, Britain, West Germany and
Israel also said they had no ships or planes in the area at the time.
   Twenty days after the crash, the wreckage of a Libyan warplane
was found in southern Italy. The discovery led to speculation that
the Libyan jet either fired or had been the target of the missile.
However, an Italian judge recently said he found no evidence to
support the theory.

<HEAD>Former Security Official Ordered Arrested in Journalist's Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has ordered the arrest of the
former chief of Mexico's federal investigative forces in the 1984
slaying of a leading newspaper columnist known for his exposes of
official corruption.
   An investigation by a special prosecutor produced enough evidence
to charge Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez with the killing of Manuel
Buendia, who frequently criticized the government in his front-page
column in the newspaper Excelsior.
   Zorilla, 49, headed the Federal Security Department from 1981 to
mid-1984. He met with Buendia three times in the month before the
slaying, including the night before the fatal shooting, the Union of
Democratic Journalists says.
   Buendia's slaying in a parking garage in Mexico City had been one
of the country's most prominent unsolved crimes.
   The government news agency Notimex said police searched Zorilla's
home in a wealthy neighborhood in the southern part of the capital
late Sunday but he was not yet under arrest.
   Authorities had named Zorrilla as a suspect as early as January
1988. In recent weeks, he has been widely mentioned in news reports
as the principal suspect.
   Miguel Angel Garcia Dominguez, the special prosecutor in the
case, says testimony in the past two months led investigators to
conclude that Zorrilla was responsible for the killing.
   Although never charged, Zorrilla had been linked to Mexican
narcotics kingpins including Rafael Caro Quintero, who is accused in
the 1985 torture and killing of U.S. narcotics agent Enrique
Camarena.
   Caro Quintero fled the western city of Guadalajara in a private
jet two days after Camarena's abduction there, allegedly with police
credentials and while police stood by. He is serving a 34-year
sentence on drug and other charges and awaiting disposition of the
homicide case.
   Zorilla also has been mentioned in news reports in connection
with the deaths of three policemen and an investigator.
   He was suspended from the security post in mid-1984 and in 1985
was dropped as a congressional candidate for the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party amid reports that he was under
investigation.
   The security department, an investigative agency similar to the
FBI, was later abolished.
   Earlier, Zorrilla was private secretary to Fernando Gutierrez
Barrios, deputy interior secretary at the time and now the
secretary. He held political posts in the northern state of Hidalgo
and served a term in Congress.
   Garcia Dominguez gave no details of the evidence that linked
Zorrilla to Buendia murder case.
   However, the Union of Democratic Journalists, an organization of
liberal journalists, said in late May that their investigation found
Buendia had been followed by the agents of Zorrilla's department for
more than three months before the May 30 killing, the magazine
Proceso said last month.
   Buendia wrote about sensitive issues most other columnists
avoided: the clergy, right-wing paramilitary groups, officials
involved in drug dealing, weapons trafficking and the complicity of
authorities in contraband.
   He wrote a book, ``The CIA in Mexico,'' published in 1983, and
often criticized U.S. policy in Central America and elsewhere.
   Journalists have alleged political interference has delayed the
investigation of Buendia's killing.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari promised during a Press
Freedom Day luncheon on Thursday to continue investigating the case.

<HEAD>Doctors Join Unions, Ethical Questions Raised</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor organizers say more and more doctors are
joining the ranks of several unions nationwide _ a trend that could
change the rules by which medical professionals play.
   Before doctors take the lives of others into their hands, they
take a Hippocratic oath to act ``with purity and with holiness,'' a
mandate that raises ethical questions about whether a doctors'
walkout would, say, stop a parent from rushing a sick child past
pickets and into an emergency room.
   Still, does that oath deprive doctors of the right to protect
their own interests, financial and otherwise?
   Union proponents and medical ethicists say no _ up to a point.
   Dr. Sanford A. Marcus, president of the Union of American
Physicians and Dentists, said his Oakland, Calif.-based consortium
has 50,000 members and is growing. He said members, affiliated
through a number of offshoots around the country, are working
together to advocate the rights of both physicians and their
patients.
   ``The entire field of health care financing and distribution is
being stood on its ear in these times,'' Marcus said. ``The rules
... are going to change an awful lot.''
   Since the mid-1980s, membership in health maintenance
organizations has risen around the nation. The prepaid medical plans
generally employ specific doctors and hospitals that provide reduced
rate care to HMO members.
   ``In a traditional insurance plan the more tests that are ordered
the more hospital days that are consumed and the more money is made
by the physician,'' said Alan Raymond, a vice president with the
500,000-member Harvard Health Plan.
   Raymond said health plans benefit both parties by bringing more
patients to doctors and reduced costs to those who need health care.
   But Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of
Minnesota, said the shift to group plans has put doctors under new
strains that might best be eased through unionization.
   ``It's a reaction by doctors feeling increasingly disenfranchised
within the health care system and by cost containment measures that
are basically shifting the structure of medicine away from a
profession and more toward a business,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Minneapolis.
   ``The medical profession has had no power,'' said Edward Hanley,
who directs the 1,000-member Doctors and Surgeons Association of
Massachusetts. ``They aren't in the business of negotiating the
economics. They're trained to help people who are ill.''
   He said doctors need to unionize to negotiate more effectively
the HMO contracts they've accepted, often out of fear that their
patient load would diminish as consumers increasingly opted out of
traditional third-party insurance.
   Dr. Barry Leibowitz, president of the New York-based Doctors
Council, said doctors have also begun complaining that health care
decisions have been usurped as HMO managers lay down guidelines.
   ``Anyone who's salaried and not protected (by a union) is subject
to the vagaries of the marketplace and management,'' he said. ``The
employers ... have very little understanding of what a physician
needs to function.''
   Aside from patients' concerns, union organizers conceded doctors
were not entirely above materialism and the possible fringe benefits
that collective bargaining might provide.
   ``Somebody has got to be there to help them get a good shake,''
the UAPD's Marcus said.
   Ethically speaking, Caplan said he saw no problem with unions and
that, in some cases, they might be overdue.
   The bioethicist did, however, draw the line where strikes were
concerned. Failing to honor their patients' needs before their own
self-interests would constitute a serious breach, he said.
   Marcus said he was confident medical union members would never
let a patient's care suffer.
   ``We would never withhold care,'' he said. ``That's not to say we
wouldn't strike against the fiscal machine, the bureaucracy or the
industrial complex that has been built out of health care, but the
patient must be taken care of under all circumstances.''

   ABC News, seeking to protect Chinese citizens
from being arrested, covered up the faces of students who provided
firsthand descriptions of the army killing protesters in Tiananmen
Square.
   ABC shielded the students' faces on its Sunday evening news
program after a man who was interviewed by the network last week was
arrested.
   The government-controlled Chinese network had intercepted raw
footage of an interview that ABC crews in Beijing sent to New York.
   The Chinese network on Saturday broadcast more than a minute of
tape that never was shown by ABC. Last week ABC showed the man's
face briefly but did not broadcast his voice.
   In its Sunday newscast, ABC quoted the unidentified students as
saying that ``to preserve our strength and prevent more losses we
can only go underground.''
   ``We don't have fear anymore. Death was very near. We are no
longer worried about ourselves,'' the students said.
   Chinese television on Saturday broadcast footage of the man
telling ABC that 20,000 people were killed in the military crackdown
of the pro-democracy uprising; it accused him of ``rumor-mongering''
and appealed to the public to turn him in.
   The national Chinese television on Sunday announced the man's
arrest in the northeastern city of Dalian after he was turned in by
two women.
   ``We are deeply distressed to learn that in this instance the
Chinese authorities intercepted unedited news material that was
being satellited and used it for political purposes,'' the network
said in a statement.
   ABC spokeswoman Laura Wessner said that last Monday ``World News
Tonight'' used about eight seconds of the tape .
   Ms. Wessner said she did not know how the raw footage was
intercepted by Chinese authorities, which broadcast one minute and
nine seconds of the man's interview with ABC.
   ``Our feeling is that he said nothing more inflammatory than
anyone else interviewed in the past month,'' she said.
   The Chinese government has said nearly 300 people were killed but
that most were soldiers attacked by ``ruffians.'' Chinese witnesses
and Western intelligence sources have said as many as 3,000 may have
died when troops fired on crowds of unarmed citizens.
   The ABC statement said the network would continue its routine
coverage of news in China, and, in keeping with its news policy,
would ``continue to honor requests of anonymity from any person who
agrees to an interview and has reason to suspect possible adverse
consequences.''
   After the raw ABC tape was shown on Chinese television, NBC
issued a written statement Sunday: ``NBC News will continue to cover
events in China, as we are able. But we will have a renewed
sensitivity that the Chinese authorities may be monitoring our news
reporting and news interviewing and will take precautions
accordingly.''
   NBC spokeswoman Virginia Holden said that the Chinese have not
intercepted any of their satellite feeds to the United States, but
that it would tape people in silhouette if they requested anonymity.
   CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said: ``We're going to examine the
situation.''

   Investigators suspect an arsonist set fire to
the West Los Angeles offices of primal-scream psychologist Arthur
Janov only hours after firefighters extinguished another blaze there.
   Los Angeles Fire Department officials said the fires, which
caused an estimated $475,000 damage on Sunday to The Primal
Institute building, appeared to be unrelated. No one was seriously
injured.
   The first blaze broke out 12:30 a.m. and was brought under
control within a half-hour. The second was reported 6:55 a.m. and
doused shortly before 8 a.m.
   Investigators said they found traces of a flammable substance at
the scene, and Battalion Chief Chuck Merriman termed the second
blaze ``suspicious.''
   Janov is known for primal scream therapy, a treatment of mental
disorder in which the patient, often in group sessions, is induced
to re-enact infancy and to express emotions in screams and shouts.
   Officials knew of no motive for the fire. The two blazes gutted
most of Janov's therapy center, which occupies the first floor of a
two-story brick building.

   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Monday, while stock prices plunged.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
shed 241.97 points, or 0.72 percent, closing at 33,398.01. The index
lost 78.31 points on Friday.
   The dollar ended trading at 148.40 yen, up 4.90 yen from Friday's
close of 143.50 yen. Monday's closing rate was the highest since
Aug. 18, 1987, when the dollar finished at 148.55 yen.
   After opening sharply higher at 147.60 yen, the U.S. currency
ranged between 147.35 and 148.45 yen during the day.
   ``The dollar's surge is blamed totally to a steep rise in U.S.
wholesale inflation,'' said Naoto Kawamura, a senior dealer with the
Bank of Tokyo.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday the nation's wholesale
prices for May surged 0.9 percent, a sharper rise than 0.4 percent
that many economists had predicted. It followed moderate rises of
0.4 percent both in March and April.
   ``The (wholesale) index dashed the prospect that the (U.S.)
Federal Reserve Board would ease its monetary policy further, at
least for the time being,'' Kawamura said.

<HEAD>Imelda Marcos Releases First Record Album</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos has released her first record album
_ a collection of her ailing husband's favorite love songs _ and her
producer says a music video will follow.
   The former Philippine first lady sang for votes for 20 years in
her homeland, but now she is hoping to reach another audience with
her first stab at commercial success.
   ``This is all so new too me, but it's nice to be recognized for
something positive, something beautiful, like music,'' she said
Sunday before a reception heralding the release of ``Imelda Papin
Featuring Songs with Mrs. Imelda Romualdez Marcos.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 59, said she agreed to join Ms. Papin, a Phillipine
pop star who has 25 gold or platinum albums in her homeland, after
recording some songs as a gift to her husband, Ferdinand, on their
35th wedding anniversary May 1.
   When the 71-year-old Marcos first heard the music, ``his eyes
slowly opened and he gave me a smile and he even blew me a kiss. It
was everything to me,'' Mrs. Marcos said, adding that she might
record another album at her husband's request.
   Marcos remained in critical condition Sunday at St. Francis
Medical Center, but Mrs. Marcos said her singing perked him up so
she was unconcerned about criticism that she should not be making
records while he lay dying.
   ``Now, I believe, music heals, beauty heals, love heals,'' she
said. ``I know he will survive, he will prevail because he has love
and he is loved.''
   Marcos, hospitalized since January, suffers from massive organ
failure complicated by a widespread bacterial infection. He remained
on life support equipment Sunday.
   The 12-song album features four solos by Mrs. Marcos _ including
``Feelings'' and three songs sung in the Philippine language Tagalog
_ and a duet with Ms. Papin, who produced the album.
   ``We're working on a music video and that should be out soon,''
said Ms. Papin. ``We're both really excited about how everything's
turned out.''
   Although Mrs. Marcos called herself ``strictly an amateur,'' Ms.
Papin said she ``has quite a nice voice.''
   Her husband's failing health and the U.S. racketeering indictment
against them _ the Marcoses are accused of plundering their nation's
treasury and stashing much of the money in the United States _ have
not dampened Mrs. Marcos' desire to sing.
   She often sings for guests at her home, has entertained at public
events honoring her family and even occasionally breaks out in song
during interviews with the press.
   Ms. Papin said the album would be released in the Philippines,
United States, the Far East and Europe.
   According to Papin Records, Mrs. Marcos' share of the profits
will be donated to the St. Francis Care Foundation.

<HEAD>Catholic Hospitals Estimate $750 Million Loss on Medicare in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 80 percent of the Roman Catholic hospitals
in the United States are expected to lose money on Medicare patients
this year, according to statistics compiled by their trade group.
   Monica Bayer of the Catholic Health Association of the United
States said Sunday the group's 599 member hospitals would lose about
$750 million overall.
   A report, ``Critical Consequences: The Financial Impact of
Medicare's Prospective Payment System on Catholic Health Association
Member Hospitals,'' was released during the group's 74th annual
meeting, which runs through Tuesday.
   The report said about one-fourth of all association hospitals
would lose 21.9 percent or more overall on Medicare patients this
year, the seventh year under the prospective payment system.
   In that method, which is used nationwide except in New York, New
Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland, payments for Medicare patients
are based on the diagnoses, rather than on the hospital's actual
cost of providing care. Those states were exempted because they had
adopted other cost controls earlier.
   The report was based on a sample of 165 member hospitals in all
states except the four which are exempt from the prospective payment
system. Bayers said at least 98 percent of the nation's Catholic
hospitals are members of the group.
   William J. Cox, the group's vice president of government
services, told the convention Sunday that Medicare operating losses
this year are estimated to be 9.2 percent on the average, compared
with 5.7 percent last year.

<HEAD>Navy Changes Powder Storage Practices After Iowa Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy will stop storing gunpowder for its
Iowa-class battleships aboard unventilated barges following the
fatal explosion on the USS Iowa, according to a published report.
   The change comes despite the Navy's belief that gunpowder was not
at fault for the fatal blast.
   Construction of additional magazines at the Yorktown Naval
Weapons Station will eliminate the need to store munitions aboard
barges on the York River, Navy officials told The Virginian-Pilot
and The Ledger-Star of Norfolk.
   When the battleship Wisconsin heads for maintenance and repairs
this summer, its powder charges _ 110-pound bags _ will not be
stored aboard uncooled, unventilated barges as the Iowa's were, the
newspaper reported in Sunday editions.
   When the Iowa went in for similar overhaul last summer, its
powder was stored aboard uncooled barges at the Yorktown station
during the hottest part of the season.
   In April, 47 sailors aboard the Iowa were killed when powder
exploded in the No. 2 gun turret during open seas gunnery practice.
Before the explosion, the No. 1 turret had a misfire when the five
bags of powder used to propel the gun's projectile wouldn't ignite.
   Navy officials have said they do not believe the storage of the
powder was to blame and are investigating the possibility of
sabotage. Nevertheless, the charges aboard the Iowa have been
removed and replaced with powder that was stored in
temperature-controlled underground bunkers.
   Navy officials did not monitor either the temperatures or
humidity aboard the barges, though the newspaper reported that the
station's safety officer had complained the munitions needed to be
moved.
   ``Permitting these charges to be stored in the barge for this
period of time indicates the lack of importance that is placed on
compliance with the safety requirements'' set forth in the Navy's
manual on munition storage, a memo from the unidentified safety
officer said in September 1988.
   Those powder charges were later returned to the Iowa when it came
back from its scheduled shipyard visit.
   Munitions experts and the Navy manual say that prolonged exposure
to high temperatures and humidity can lead to deterioration of the
powder charges, making them either inert or extremely volatile.
   The internal report estimates the temperature inside the
aluminum-sided barges were 25 degrees higher than the outside air
temperature. Using that estimate, the newspaper calculated from
National Weather Service readings for the area that the temperature
inside the barges could have exceeded 110 degrees on 66 days during
the time the powder was in storage.
   Thomas Black, administrative officer at the Yorktown station,
said the Wisconsin's powder would not be stored at the station, the
largest of the Navy's six weapon stations.
   Black said additional magazines are being built at the weapons
station to accommodate more munitions. According to the Pentagon,
Yorktown is the only one of the Navy's munitions stations that uses
barges for temporary powder storage.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contra rebel leader Alfredo Cesar has
ended seven years of exile and returned home to join the political
battle against the Sandinista government.
   Cesar's return on Sunday follows that of two other Contra leaders
over the past two weeks. Both signed an amnesty document saying they
do not support armed struggle against the leftist Sandinistas.
   Cesar said he came to Nicaragua ``to devote myself exclusively to
the civic political fight.'' He would not say if he had resigned as
one of seven director of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the organization
of the U.S.-backed Contras.
   ``I bring a message of hope, that we should prepare, that the
fight ahead of us in the electoral arena is a vital struggle for
Nicaragua ... and that we are going to win if we organize well,''
Cesar told reporters at the Managua international airport after
arriving from Miami via Guatemala.
   The 38-year-old Cesar said he would join the Social Democratic
Party but would not seek an elective post in general elections
scheduled for February.
   Cesar was president of the Central Bank when he left the country
on April 25, 1982. He had lived in Miami, where the Nicaraguan
Resistance is based.
   Nine other exiles and Contra members returned on a commercial
flight about one hour before Cesar arrived on a small jet that his
wife, Sylvia Lacayo de Cesar, said was provided by the Venezuelan
government.
   The other opposition leaders who recently returned are Azucena
Ferrey, who resigned as member of the directorate last fall, and
Fernando Aguero, who helped negotiate a temporary cease-fire between
the Contras and the Sandinistas in March 1988.
   The United States cut off military aid to the rebels a month
earlier and most Contra fighters fled to camps in neighboring
Honduras.
   The Sandinistas took power in July 1979 after spearheading a
civil war that toppled the rightist government of President
Anastasio Somoza.
   In another development, the government devalued the currency by
52.5 percent, effective today, and raised gasoline prices by the
same amount. It was the 20th devaluation of the cordoba this year
and the second this month.
   The rate fell from 9,500 cordobas to 20,000 cordobas to the
dollar.
   Gasoline will rise from 17,700 cordobas to 37,200 cordobas a
gallon, or about $1.85.
   Banking officials have said the frequent devaluations are ``to
maintain the profitability of export products.''
   The devaluations generate substantial increases in what residents
must pay for basic products.

   Hells Angels leader Michael ``Irish''
O'Farrell received the club's funeral honors as hundreds of bikers
wearing jackets emblazoned with the winged skull escorted his body
to a cemetery.
   O'Farrell, believed by law enforcement to be second in the club's
hierarchy only to the its spriritual leader, Ralph ``Sonny'' Barger
Jr., died during a bloody bar brawl on Tuesday.
   ``You couldn't ask for a more dedicated or more faithful guy to
his friends and to the Hells Angels,'' a club member known only as
Cisco said at the funeral service.
   ``I ain't going to say goodbye. Goodbyes are for the movies. So
long, buddy,'' he said in a choked voice.
   Both O'Farrell, who celebrated his 40th birthday four days before
his death, and Barger faced sentencing on federal explosives
convictions. O'Farrell was stabbed once each in the neck and chest
and five times in the back as well as being shot four times from
behind, the Alameda County coroner's office said.
   About 1,000 people filed into a funeral home in East Oakland to
pay final respects Saturday to O'Farrell, who acted as president of
the club's Oakland chapter in the early 1980s while Barger recovered
from a throat operation for cancer.
   After visiting the closed casket, decorated with flowers and
pictures of him on his motorcycle, mourners walked into an adjoining
room to offer condolences to Barger. Wreaths from motorcycle clubs
throughout the West adorned the chapel.
   Mourners, including O'Farrell's wife, Teddy, his son, and about
250 bikers, accompanied his body to Evergreen Cemetery. There,
bikers buried O'Farrell after placing ribbons and banners from the
flowers on the casket.
   Investigators don't have a motive for O'Farrell's killing and
don't believe he was killed by a rival gang.
   But Alameda County Sheriff's Lt. Dean Hess said last week drugs
were involved. Powdered methamphetamine, better known as speed, was
found on the San Leandro bar's patio, where the killing occurred.
   Barger and O'Farrell, both of Oakland, were convicted in October
for what prosecutors said was a revenge attack for the slaying of a
Hells Angel who was shot outside a bar in Jefferson County, Ky., in
August 1986. A Louisville Outlaw motorcycle club member had pleaded
guilty to reckless homicide in Webb's death.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp's 1985 report on
organized crime described motorcycle gangs like the Hells Angels as
controlling most of the manufacture and distribution of
methamphetamine through a large-scale clandestine operation of
laboratories and distribution networks.
   Law enforcement experts say the Angels switched from biking,
carousing and bar-busting to organized crime in the mid-1960s.
   Van de Kamp said the Hells Angels, known for riding
Harley-Davidson motorcycles, have 60 chapters worldwide, 13 in
California. The group was founded in the Southern California steel
town of Fontana about 1950.

<TEXT>
   A time bomb exploded in a crowded
passenger hall at the capital's main railroad station today, killing
at least seven people and injuring 54 others, police said.
   Twelve of the injured lost arms or legs, the police control
center said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   ``I heard a very loud sound and then saw smoke, blood and limbs
around me,'' said Ramesh Kumar, who was in the hall but escaped
injury. ``It was like hell. I thought I was seeing a bad bloody
movie.''
   Blood from the victims, many of whom were waiting to board trains
for summer vacations, splattered the hall's 60-foot high ceiling and
at least a 100-square-foot section of the floor.
   ``It was a time bomb and a very, very powerful one,'' Police
Commissioner Rajindra Mohan said at the scene.
   He said forensic experts had recovered a portion of the bomb that
contained an intact battery cell and nuts and bolts, which would
have spewed out with deadly force.
   The bomb left a crater about one foot deep and two feet in
diameter in the station floor.
   Sandals, sunglasses, cooked rice and half-eaten bread were strewn
across the floor, blown by the force of the blast or dropped by
panicked people.
   Here and there were the bodies of pigeons, who normally roost on
the ceiling's lights.
   Mohan said waiting passengers often lie or sleep on the floor of
the hall, and he said many more people might have been killed had
they been standing when the bomb went off.
   New Delhi's 32,000 police were put on alert. The city government
broadcast warnings against touching objects left in public places.
   The city's exit routes were blocked. Vehicles leaving the capital
were checked.
   Mohan declined to say who might have been behind the bombing.
   The Press Trust of India quoted a witness, Pawan Kumar, as saying
he saw a man with a mustache ask someone to watch his briefcase and
a wooden crate while he went to get a drink of water. A few minutes
later the bomb exploded in the same spot, the news agency quoted
Kumar as saying.
   Railways Minister Madhavrao Scindia, asked if he thought the
blast was the work of Sikh extremists who set off a series of bombs
in the capital in 1985, said: ``I will not rule out the involvement
of terrorism. It looks like the job can only be done by them.''
   Scindia would not say whether he was referring to Sikhs. The
government routinely speaks only of ``terrorists'' when referring to
Sikh radicals, whose campaign for a separate homeland has claimed
about 850 lives this year in northern Punjab state.
   The last major Sikh attack in New Delhi occurred nearly a year
ago. Four people were killed and more than 40 wounded on June 20,
1988, when Sikh militants hurled a grenade into a crowded outdoor
market.
   In 1985 a series of bombs, often concealed in transistor radios,
killed at least 87 people in the capital.
   The bomb at the station went off at 10:35 a.m., a peak hour at
the station when most trains from eastern India arrive in New Delhi.
   From 600 to 700 people were in the passenger hall at the time.
   More than 150,000 people and at least 158 trains pass through the
station daily.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises To Highest Level in Tokyo Since August 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar today rose nearly five yen to a 22-month
high against the Japanese currency, sending prices down on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, dealers said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 241.97 points, or 0.72
percent, finishing at 33,398.01. The index had lost 78.31 points on
Friday.
   The dollar closed at 148.40 yen, up 4.90 yen from Friday's
143.50-yen close. Today's close was the highest since the dollar
finished at 148.55 yen on Aug. 18, 1987.
   After opening at 147.60 yen, the currency fluctuated between
147.35 yen and 148.45 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's sharpest jump in almost two years
resulted mainly from uncertainties over developments in China and a
sharper-than-expected rise in the U.S. wholesale price index
announced on Friday in Washington.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported that the nation's wholesale
prices surged 0.9 percent in May. The rise had been expected to be
nearer the moderate climbs of 0.4 percent in both March and April.
   ``The Chinese situation and the wholesale price index did have an
impact on the trading, prompting dollar-buying, but most investors
were jumping on the bandwagon,'' said Sanwa Bank's Hirokazu Yoshida.
   Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said
market sentiment here was totally inclined toward dollar-buying.
   ``Japanese investors would have bought even if the wholesale
index had been lower. At present, just about anything seems to have
the potential to be a dollar-buying incentive for Japanese
investors,'' she said.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan intermittently sold dollars in
efforts to check the U.S. currency's rise, but the amount was
unknown. The central bank does not comment on its foreign exchange
operations.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama said Japan will take
measures in cooperation with other Group of Seven major monetary
nations to cope with the ``speculative'' foreign exchange markets,
Kyodo News Service reported today.
   Kyodo also quoted an unidentified Bank of Japan source as saying
the current dollar-buying was highly speculative.
   On the stock market, dealers blamed the decline in the market's
main barometer on the yen's sharp drop.
   Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro Umemori said the index fell in
early trading, as a majority of investors moved to the sidelines,
and stayed low throughout the day.
   ``The yen's decline, more than four yen just over the weekend,
did have a great impact on market players,'' he said. ``It was only
natural that most investors totally lost motivation to buy stocks
today.''
   ``The problem is that the market is taking the dollar's rise for
granted,'' Umemori said. ``Anything can be a dollar-buying
incentive, and whenever the dollar-yen rate becomes unstable, it
discourages stock investors.''
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 350 million shares,
the smallest this year, dealers said.
   Market players sold varieties of issues including steel,
construction and shipbuilding.

   A U.S. official met a Japanese monk who claims to
have shared a room with U.S. prisoners of war in Vietnam, and
information from the meeting is being sent to Washington for
analysis, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said today.
   The U.S. representative met twice during his stay in northern
Japan Sunday and today with Iwanobu Yoshida, a Buddhist monk who was
freed in January after 14 years' imprisonment in Vietnam, embassy
spokesman Karl Olsson said.
   Olsson refused to specify what was discussed or how long the
sessions were. He said the content of the meetings was being passed
on to Washington for further analysis.
   The U.S. official met Yoshida at a hospital in Sapporo, on
Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido. Yoshida, 65, suffers
from mental disorders and a speech impediment, a hospital spokesman
said.
   In the past week, Japanese news reports and Yoshida's daughter,
Keiko Takatsuka, have said he saw several Americans in the
re-education camp where he was held and that he shared a cell with
three of them.
   Ms. Takatsuka, who was not immediately available for comment on
the meeting, has said her father does not remember the names of the
three held in his cell, but that they were ``young and healthy.''
   The Vietnamese Embassy in Tokyo denies the claims. Vietnam has
said repeatedly that it does not hold any American prisoners from
the Vietnam War.
   After becoming a monk in 1966, Yoshida emigrated to Vietnam,
where he set up a temple in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. He became
a South Vietnamese citizen in 1973.
   Yoshida was arrested in 1975, after Communist forces took over
South Vietnam. On Jan. 20, Vietnam released him for humanitarian
reasons after appeals were filed by international human rights
groups including Amnesty International.

   Alexsei Sultanov, at 19 the youngest
finalist at the Eighth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition,
said he took the contest's top honors by holding nothing back.
   ``In this competition I wanted to get first prize or nothing,''
Sultanov said Sunday through an interpreter after beating 37 other
competitors in the prestigious two-week contest known for launching
musical careers.
   The Soviet shook hands with Van Cliburn, the Fort Worth pianist
for whom the contest is named, and host Dudley Moore at the awards
ceremony at the Tarrant County Convention Center.
   Jose Carlos Cocarelli, a 30-year-old Brazilian making his second
appearance in the quadrennial competition, won the silver medal.
Benedetto Lupo, a 25-year-old Italian, was awarded the bronze medal.
   Asked how he felt placing second to the youngest contestant,
Cocarelli said: ``This is a very difficult question. It is almost
too delicate.''
   The medalists were narrowed from six finalists who endured two
weeks of grueling piano performances. The competition culminated
with each finalist playing two concertos _ one with the Fort Worth
Symphony Orchestra and another with the Fort Worth Chamber Orchestra.
   Besides the gold medal, the winner receives $15,000, a Carnegie
Hall debut recital, concert tours and free air travel.
   Sultanov became a crowd favorite with his aggressive performances.
   He also became only the second 19-year-old to win the contest.
The other was Christina Ortiz of Brazil, who won in 1969. She served
as a juror this year.
   The finalists gave encore performances after the awards were
announced. Sultanov dazzled the audience of more than 3,000 with
Chopin's Grande Waltz Brilliante in E-flat major.
   In the finals, Sultanov played Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F
minor and Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor.
   Asked what he performed best, Sultanov said: ``It's difficult to
say. It's difficult to even remember what I did.''
   Second prize includes $10,000 in cash, a New York recital and
concert tours. The third place contestant receives $7,500 and
concert tours.
   Other finalists were Alexander Shtarkman, 22, and Elisso
Bolkvadze, 22, both of the Soviet Union; and Ying Tian, 20, of China
and now a Boston resident. Shtarkman placed fourth, Ying fifth and
Ms. Bolkvadze sixth.
   Shtarkman's father, Naum, placed third to Cliburn's first when
the Texas pianist won the International Tchaikovsky Competition in
Moscow in 1958.
   The only American making it to the semifinals, Kevin Kenner
received one of four Steven De Groote Memorial Chamber Music Awards,
presented in honor of the 1977 Cliburn gold medalist from South
Africa. He received $6,000 in awards.

<HEAD>Air Show Features New Devices To Detect Plastic Explosives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New security systems capable of detecting plastic
explosives were displayed by two U.S. companies at the Paris Air
Show, the first international air exposition since the December
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner.
   The Federal Aviation Administration invited the companies to show
the technology, on the market for the first time this spring, during
the 10-day gathering at Le Bourget airport north of Paris.
   In recent years, searches, metal detectors and X-ray machines
have become routine at airports, and the number of hijackings has
declined. But passenger planes remain vulnerable to hidden devices.
   It takes less than a pound of plastic explosive, the size of a
chocolate bar, to bring down a jumbo jet. The deadly material can be
molded into shapes that are easy to hide.
   Such an explosive hidden in a radiocasette player is believed to
have caused the death of 275 passengers anbd crew who were aboard
Pan Am flight 103, which fell in pieces onto the Scottish village of
Lockerbee in December.
   Thermedics Inc. of Woburn, Mass., came up with a ``sniffer'' that
detects chemical vapors. The $125,000 hand-held sniffer, called
EGIS, is a computerized chemical analyzer with programmed rules,
called algorithms.
   ``If you look at the last 15 incidents of bombing or attempted
bombing, in six of them the bomb found its way into the aircraft
cabin,'' said Thermedics President John W. Wood Jr. on Sunday.
``This illustrates the need to screen people and carry on bags as
well as checked luggage.''
   Thermedics has developed a second sniffer that is about a year
away from the markeplace. It is called SecurScan and works on the
same principle as EGIS but is designed as a walk-through chamber
similar to the now common metal detector.
   A second new device is being shown by Science International
Applications Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. Their apparatus is called
a thermal neutron activation, or TNA and sells for $900,000.
   Baggage passes on a conveyor belt through a chamber where it is
showered with neutrons that react when exposed to nitrogen, the
chemical emitted by virtually all explosives. The reaction produces
a scattering of gamma rays, a sort of chemical fingerprint that is
analyzed by a computer.
   Six units have been purchased by the FAA for installation at New
York's Kennedy Airport and London's Gatwick and 12 others will be
installed in high-risk airports in the United States and overseas.

   Beware of bridges and cemeteries
in Oakland County: Snoopy pyschics say the environs make it easier
to eavesdrop on your psyches.
   The Glen Eden Cemetery in Novi, in southeastern Michigan, is a
center rich in psychic power, said psychic-astrologer Robert
Thibodeau. Another is the Roseland Park Cemetery in Berkley.
   ``What you have in cemeteries is a combination of nature forces
and historical events that took place,'' said Thibodeau, a bookshop
owner.
   Other spots are Lake Cranbrook in Bloomfield Hills and at a
bridge at Bloomer State Park in Rochester.
   ``I have found that in the middle of that bridge there is an
incredible amount of force and energy,'' said Sue Fine, who sells
psychic crystals.
   It isn't clear why the vibes are so strong in Oakland County.
   ``I think it's something to do with the water,'' said Fatima, a
psychic from Harper Woods.
   ``It's easier to read people'' in Bloomfield Hills, she said.
``The readings just flow from them. For some reason, they want to be
read.''

   A team of engineering students has
envisioned the automotive future, and it looks a giant cheese wedge
on three wheels that seats one and gets 1,278 miles per gallon of
gasoline.
   ``Big Richard,'' designed by 11 engineering students at
California State University, Northridge, was the winner of Sunday's
sixth annual West Coast Supermileage Competition.
   The dark red three-wheeler driven by student Hiep Nguyen led a
field of 12 vehicles from eight California colleges and universities
in four laps around a 1}-mile test track.
   ``The SLO,'' a whale-shaped vehicle entered by eight students
from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo,
finished second with 951 mpg.
   A four-student team from California State University, Sacramento,
which fielded the champion designs in the past two years, came in
third with 888 mpg by ``The Stinger.''
   Gas mileage, not speed, determined the winner, said Ben Winkler
of the California State Automobile Association, which sponsored the
event with the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   A CSU Sacramento team set the U.S. record in 1987 with 1,971 mpg.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms blanketed much of the nation today, soaking
Kansas with heavy rain, after destructive tornadoes and fierce winds
ripped through parts of Missouri and Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms drenched the eastern Dakotas, central
Oklahoma, western Minnesota, Iowa, eastern Missouri, Illinois,
southern Indiana, western Kentucky, western Tennessee, northern
Mississippi and northern Alabama this morning. Showers also were
scattered from eastern Montana across Colorado.
   In Kansas, about 30 families were evacuated from their homes in
Coffeyville early Sunday after flash flooding over the weekend, said
police Officer Ray McDaniel.
   ``A lot of the families are back at the houses cleaning up now,''
McDaniel said late Sunday. ``But nobody has moved back in.''
   Besides street flooding in the southeastern Kansas community,
cars were submerged and several power outages were reported, he said.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included
2 inches at Cape Girardeau, Mo., and 1\ inches at Burlington, Iowa.
   A tornado tore through Steele, Mo., on Sunday evening, leveling
at least two homes, and leaving one woman hospitalized after she
suffered a heart attack, authorities said.
   The twister struck an area south of Steele, in southeast
Missouri, at about 6 p.m.
   A tornado also touched down west of Groom, Texas, late Sunday.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorm winds caused damage at Meridian, Miss.,
and thunderstorm gusts hit 52 mph at Las Vegas, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Great Lakes across the Ohio Valley, the central and southern
Appalachians, the Tennessee Valley, much of the Mississippi Valley,
northern Texas, Oklahoma, the Dakotas, eastern Montana and much of
Colorado.
   Predicted highs: 60s and 70s from northern New England across the
northern Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, the upper
Mississippi Valley, the northern Plains, from Montana across eastern
Colorado, and the California coast; 90s from southern South Carolina
across Florida, the lower half of the central Gulf of Mexico states,
much of Texas and New Mexico, and from southwest Oregon across
eastern and central California; near 105 across the desert
Southwest; and in the 80s over the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 85 at Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   The following are excerpts of an exclusive
Associated Press interview with dissident Fang Lizhi conducted in
English at his Beijing apartment June 2, just days before he sought
protection at the U.S. Embassy.
   The interview was conducted after the declaration of martial law
in Beijing to quell a public uprising for a freer society and one
day before the People's Liberation Army indiscriminately fired on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Q: What is your assessment of events in China now?
   A: These events are very important. This is the first time
students, intellectuals and ordinary people know they have the right
to criticize the government. That has never happened before.
   Q: Were you surprised by the number of people who joined the
protest?
   A: Yes, I only expected students and intellectuals and a few
workers, but I was very surprised there were so many ordinary people
(who) joined. That means they've already approached that stage where
the people demand political reforms.
   Q: What about the immediate effect?
   A: In the short-term, I don't think we can easily change a lot.
Maybe to change a small step is possible. For instance, this time we
can get a little bit of freedom of the press.
   Q: What do you think will happen in the long term?
   A: In the long term, we need the older generation of the
leadership to go, like (senior leader) Deng (Xiaoping). If they
leave, the situation will be better. More democracy.
   Q: At a government demonstration two days ago they burned you in
effigy. What is your reaction?
   A: (Laughs) For me personally, it's a joke. But I should say the
government doing that is something like 20 years ago (when) Mao
(Tse-tung) set out the Red Guard. That is dangerous.
   You know, somebody asked me about my safety. I think it's about
half-half. If the government organizes something like the Red
Guards, then I'm in danger.
   Q: Are you worried about that?
   A: Yeah, maybe, but I don't think this time will be as easy as
Mao's time.
   Q: Why have you been quiet during the demonstrations?
   A: Even if I keep quiet the government still says I'm the head of
the ... demonstrations. If I join the student demonstrations, the
government can very easily say this demonstration is organized by
Professor Fang. Because (Chinese leaders say) only very few persons
like Professor Fang demand democracy, demand human rights.
   Q: The government has indicated you are behind the
demonstrations. Is this true or false?
   A: False. I'm never involved in the organization. Of course, I
have a very strong influence spiritually. You know, some student
leaders before the demonstrations often came here. Since the hunger
strike (that began May 13) they've never been here. The students
know I completely support them, but they don't want to show some
connection.
   Q: Are you concerned another crackdown on intellectuals is coming?
   A: Yes. Deng and other leaders always want to crack down on
liberal intellectuals.
   Q: Has there been any pressure on you from authorities.
   A: No direct pressure.
   Q: How about indirect pressure?
   A: Last week I visited Shaanxi province for a meeting. The
security members watched me very closely. If I took a car, two cars
followed. If I took a bus, two cars followed. Even if I went
sightseeing, many security members followed. I'm very honored.
(Laughs).
   Q: Are you afraid you'll be arrested before this is over?
   A: Yes, I just mentioned a half-half (possibility).
   Q: Are you pessimistic or optimistic about China's political
future?
   A: Long-term, I'm still optimistic. I think at least after the
older generation leaves it will get better.
   Q: Do you think Deng Xiaoping has lost prestige because of the
way this has been handled?
   A: He's also near his finish. He already lost his face.

<TEXT>
   The dollar surged in hectic trading in Europe today
on a wave of dollar-buying that started Friday.
   Gold prices fell on the dollar's climb and on continued
profit-taking in bullion.
   ``It looks like the dollar has found a solid base,'' said Ernst
Pullmann, chief trader at Deutsche Girozentrale-Deutsche Kommunale
Bank in Frankfurt.
   ``At the moment there are hardly any dollar sellers,'' he said.
   Some traders attributed the dollar's strength to Friday's news of
a surprisingly large 0.9 percent increase in U.S. producer prices in
May. That fueled expectations that U.S. interest rates would remain
high.
   Other traders said the dollar continued to be supported by
investors in the Far East who were converting assets into
dollar-denominated investments because of the turmoil in China.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar soared nearly 5 yen to a 22-month high against the
Japanese currency. The dollar closed at 148.40 yen, up 4.90 yen from
Friday.
   Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 149.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _2.0305 West German marks, up from 2.0025
   _1.7645 Swiss francs, up from 1.7402
   _6.8815 French francs, up from 6.7810
   _2.2918 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2510
   _1,469 Italian lire, up from 1,450.50
   _1.2025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1999
   In London, the dollar jumped against the British pound. It cost
$1.5305 dollars to buy one pound, compared with $1.5545 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $357.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $363.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $358.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $358.50 compared with $368.05 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.47 to close at a bid $359.03.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.15 a troy ounce,
down from Friday's $5.27.

   A British journalist expelled from China said
today that the officials who seized him while he was covering a
demonstration in Shanghai took his film and refused to let him
contact the British Consulate.
   Peter Newport of Independent Television News was the first
journalist expelled from China since the student-led campaign for
greater freedom began in mid-April. He was ordered out on Saturday
and flew to Hong Kong.
   After he was expelled, Shanghai authorities sent a letter to
diplomatic missions telling them to instruct journalists that they
cannot cover news in the city without Foreign Ministry permission.
   In Beijing, a British Broadcasting Co. television reporter today
said he and his crew were detained Sunday while filming. Brian
Barron said the identity cards and passports of members of the crew
were confiscated and they were told they should not leave China
without official authorization.
   Foreign reporters in Beijing must have local government approval
to report from all areas under martial law, meaning all of central
Beijing.
   They are also banned from interviewing people on activities that
violate martial law decrees, taking pictures of troops and receiving
materials prohibited under martial law.
   In an telephone interview, Newport said he was seized while
videotaping a sit-in by about 50 students in front of Shanghai's
public security building on Saturday. He was told he could not
report on a tourist visa.
   Newport told the security officials who seized him that he would
not answer questions until allowed contact with the consulate but,
``I was never allowed to contact the British Consulate.''
   He said he was filming the sit-in when officers ``just grabbed me
by the arms and pulled me past the police lines and the gateway of
the public security building. ... I got away from them but they came
after me and dragged me back.''
   The officers took his passport and asked that he erase his film.
When he did not comply, a technician was summoned. The officers
watched the tape erased, and they kept it.
   Newport said he was then taken to another building where a half
dozen officers questioned him for 75 minutes.
   He said officers videotaped and wrote down the conversation and
had Newport sing the written record of the conversation.
   ``They basically said I was going to be treated leniently because
I had admitted what I had done and I apologized but that I was to be
expelled from China,'' he said.
   Newport said reporting in China has become dangerous for all
involved, pointing to the case of ABC News.
   The U.S. network said Sunday that Chinese authorities intercepted
raw footage of an ABC interview with a man in Beijing, broadcast the
tape on national television and then used it to arrest him for
``rumor-mongering.''
   Chinese television on Saturday broadcast footage of the man
telling ABC that 20,000 people were killed in the June 3-4 assault
that crushed the pro-democracy uprising in Beijing. His arrest was
announced on national television on Sunday.
   The government has said nearly 300 people were killed, most of
them soldiers attacked by ``ruffians.'' Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence sources have said as many as 3,000 were killed,
most of them civilians, when troops fired on unarmed protesters.

   Cammie King Conlon, who played Bonnie Blue in
the movie ``Gone With the Wind,'' says if it didn't take so long to
begin shooting the film classic, she would have never landed the
part.
   ``I got the role by default,'' Conlon said of the decision to
have her play Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler's child. ``My older
sister was cast for the part, but by the time the shooting began,
she was too old to play Bonnie Blue.''
   Conlon and two other actors said the process of filling
supporting roles was very casual. The performers helped mark the
50th anniversary of the Academy Award-winning production at the
annual Clark Gable celebration Saturday in the actor's birthplace.
   Gable played Butler, the film's central male character.
   Also on hand at the celebration was Daniel Mayer Selznick, the
son of the late GWTW producer David O. Selznick. Daniel Selznick
recently completed a documentary on the making of ``Gone With the
Wind.''

<HEAD>High School Writers Focus On Stories Of Midwestern History And Culture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELLAIR, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The young writers came from the city, the
stories from the country, and the modest magazine bridged the gap
between the two cultures.
   There were stories about butchering hogs, one-room schoolhouses,
barn-raising, canning with grandma, and an old man's memories.
   Now, after a three-year break, ``Tales from the General Store''
is back in publication, and its founder hopes both its readers and
its writers benefit.
   ``For students, I see it as a way to learn to write in a hands-on
way,'' said editor Ray Elliott, an Urbana high school teacher. ``It
also provides a valuable service by preserving the history and
culture of the rural Midwest.''
   ``Tales'' is printed in the format of a small tabloid newspaper.
   It is distributed as an insert to the Casey Reporter, the
Marshall Independent, the Robinson Daily News, the Daily Record in
Lawrenceville, the Martinsville Planet, the Oakland-Hindsboro
Prairie Sun and the Robinson Constitution.
   Elliott also hopes to mail it to the 1,000 subscribers in 35
states who took Tales when it was published between 1981 and 1986.
Four issues a year will cost $5. Individual and corporate
contributions will be another source of income for the magazine, he
said.
   Elliott began Tales in 1981 while teaching at Oak Lawn Community
High School in suburban Chicago, when he took seven students to stay
at his father's property near Bellair, about 200 miles south of
Chicago.
   ``We just camped near the woods _ no water or electricity,'' he
recalled. ``We had to take two of them back to the train in
Effingham the second day. It was just too primitive.''
   The others stayed on, interviewing and photographing people in
the area for the first edition of Tales.
   ``They'd use a tape-recorder and use a lot of people's exact
words,'' said Elliott. ``Then, they'd weave in a description of the
scene - the sights, the sounds and the smells.''
   Elliott's non-profit corporation also bought the old Bellair
general store. They ate there, worked there and brought in local
people to demonstrate things like chair caning and relate memories
of the area.
   ``A lot of old people die without telling all the stories from
their lives and they are lost forever,'' said Laurie Goering, who
first wrote for Tales in 1983. ``This is a nice way to preserve
them.''
   Goering, who now writes for the Chicago Tribune, once did a story
about a man who made alcohol from old candy that had been discarded
by stores. She says that Elliott is good at working with young
people because ``he teaches them that writing is fun.''
   But eventually, donations to Tales dried up. Elliott also left
his teaching job, so he lost his source of student writers.
   Tales ended in 1986 after its 10th issue.
   Now, with new students and new donations, Elliott hopes Tales
will broaden its coverage.
   ``We'll focus on the Midwest _ anything of historical
significance or cultural interest,'' he said.
   The new issue features memories of ``The Tin Lizzie,'' the first
horseless carriage, in poem form; the struggles of
Champaign-Urbana's first newspaper publishers, who battled unhappy
advertisers, unhappy readers and each other; the efforts of the
small town of Oakland to survive and thrive; and an essay by a
recent high school graduate on the death of her little sister.
   ``The sky was dark the day she was buried,'' Cynthia Cox wrote.
``I had to sit in the front of the limousine with the driver because
I was the one who was able to climb in by myself. My face was as
dark as the day and appeared blank.''

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Marine fighter plane crashed into a mountain
in southwestern Japan today, but the pilot parachuted to safety,
officials said.
   There were no reports of injuries to Japanese residents or major
damage to forests after the plane, an FA-18 Hornet jet, hit the
mountain in Ehime, on southwestern Shikoku Island, said a police
official on condition of anonymity.
   The plane, on a training flight, plunged into the mountain about
55 miles southeast of the U.S. Iwakuni Marine Air Station. The pilot
bailed out safely, according to marine Sgt. Rick Ecker.
   The pilot was identified as Maj. Robert E. Schmiddle Jr. His
hometown was not immediately available.
   A rescue helicopter from the Iwakuni base picked up Schmiddle
about 50 minutes after the crash, and he was taken to a clinic for a
checkup.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation.

<TEXT>
   A Maryland woman dubbed ``Robin HUD'' by
federal investigators claims she embezzled as much as $5.5 million
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to give to the
poor.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was described Sunday as being ``very
upset'' by the losses, which according to The Washington Post could
reach $10 million in the Washington field office alone because of
extraordinarily lax bookkeeping involving foreclosure sales of
government property.
   Kemp ordered HUD Inspector General Paul Adams to conduct an
immediate investigation of the alleged embezzlement in the
Washington office and on Friday he placed four employees on leave
without pay, Frank Keating, HUD's general counsel-designee, said in
an interview Sunday.
   The New York Times said investigations also were under way in HUD
offices in Denver, Houston, New Orleans and Los Angeles about
million-dollar diversions.
   Marilyn Harrell, a private escrow agent in Maryland who's being
called ``Robin HUD,'' said she was able to divert $5.5 million
during a four-year period to help feed, clothe and house the poor.
   She said today she realized she was breaking the law and she is
prepared to go to jail. ``I was amazed it went on as long as it did.
But people kept coming for help and we had access to the monies and
no one seemed to be particularly concerned...,'' she said on ABC's
``Good Morning America.''
   ``I figured that as long as I was going to go to jail anyway, I
would help a few people with the time I had left,'' the 46-year-old
Temple Hills, Md., resident told the Times.
   Charlotte Chepaitis, who runs a shelter for the homeless in
Baltimore, described Harrell as a saint. ``She was an answer to many
hundreds and hundreds of prayers,'' Chepaitis said.
   In Texas, escrow agent Reba Louise Lovell already has been
indicted on charges she embezzled $2.5 million from the sale of 55
homes in the Dallas area.
   A two-year investigation in the Washington office led to an
inspector general's audit. Sources close to the probe told the Times
that the losses were a ``bookkeeping disaster'' but did not appear
to result from criminal intent on the part of any department
officials.
   The sources said that in some cases, department employees allowed
checks for as much as $100,000 to languish in drawers far beyond the
point when most banks would cash them for deposit into government
accounts.
   Keating said that based upon the news accounts, ``I'm outraged,
and I know the secretary is extremely upset that acts like this
could take place, although as noted all of them allegedly took place
prior to him taking office.''
   Keating would not comment directly on Harrell's claims.
   Keating said Kemp ordered an investigation by the inspector
general's office and an accounting firm ``to determine the extent of
the problem, suggest remedies and construct a system which will make
this kind of conduct infrequent if not impossible in the future.''
   ``The fact that in Dallas a closing agent could allegedly
embezzle $2 million and not be noticed, the fact that in Maryland a
closing agent could allegedly give $5 million to the poor and not be
noticed shows serious management deficiencies, and the secretary
intends to see that that conduct does not recur,'' Keating said.
   The investigation is separate from a congressional inquiry into
allegations that influence-peddling at HUD allowed more than a dozen
former Reagan administration officials to benefit from housing
programs meant for the poor.
   Agents such as Harrell handle closings for the Federal Housing
Administration when it sells foreclosed property. They are supposed
to turn over the sales proceeds to the government while keeping a
small commission.
   In 1985, Harrell used some of the HUD money to cover a $37,000
shortfall in her business, she told the Times. When several months
passed without an inquiry from HUD, it became clear to her the
department was unable to track the millions in dollars in payments
due from escrow agents, she said.
   She took more money _ as much as $5.5 million, by her estimate _
before anyone noticed. She said much of the money went to a charity
she founded called ``Friends of the Father'' and that she rented or
bought 20 homes and nearly 40 automobiles for the needy.
   She told the Post in an interview published Sunday that some of
the money may have become ``mingled'' into improvements on her home
that included a swimming pool, a $2,500 wide-screen television and
renovations to her basement.
   Her scheme began to unravel last year, she said, when a HUD
official in the Washington field office, Everett Rothschild,
detected the diversion.
   Rothschild would not comment when contacted Sunday. He is chief
of the property disposition division of the Washington field office.
Keating said Rothschild was placed on leave without pay along with
Margaret White, who heads the office; Robert Warner, director of
housing management; and Charles Womble, a supervisory loan
specialist.
   Harrell faces a grand jury investigation in Baltimore and says
she is cooperating with investigators trying to track the diverted
funds.
   ``Christians aren't perfect,'' she told the Times. ``They're just
forgiven.''

<TEXT>
   South Korea needs U.S. troops to defend
itself against the communist North and is opposed to any reduction
in the American military force, the defense minister said today.
   Also today, police arrested a dozen radical students protesting a
police raid on their school to seize pro-North Korea propaganda
materials. Riot police also clashed with student protesters in Pusan.
   In another development, President Roh Tae-woo said strikes, high
wage increases and other labor problems are undermining the nation's
economy. He appealed to employers and workers to show restraint and
work together.
   The defense minister, Lee Sang-hoon, told the National Assembly's
Defense Committee that the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea
``need to be stationed here for a considerable period of time in the
future.''
   Lee was responding to a recent proposal by Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., for a reduction in U.S. forces in Korea to about 10,000
troops.
   Lee said these conditions must be met prior to a U.S. troop
pullout:
   _North Korea must renounce any plans to unify the Korean
peninsula by force, and an institution must be established to ensure
peace on the peninsula.
   _The military balance on the peninsula must be maintained by
securing a replacement combat capability corresponding to the
American troop withdrawal.
   _There must be complete agreement on a U.S. withdrawal reached
through full consultations between the U.S. and South Korean
governments.
   Lee said South Korea also would need to boost its military
spending from 5 percent to 8 percent of its gross national product
over a five-year period to build up its own military strength if
U.S. troops leave.
   He said the period of active duty for South Korean soldiers would
need to be extended from 30 months to 50 months.
   Lee said the government was concerned that some
``sentimentalist'' South Koreans were advocating reunification and
some ``nationalistic'' citizens were demanding U.S. troops be
withdrawn at the risk of national security.
   The minister was referring to dissidents who have called for the
reunification of South and North Korea, split since 1945, and a
pullout of U.S. troops, charging that the American military presence
obstructs reunfication.
   U.S. administration officials have said their troops will stay as
long as they are wanted by South Korea.
   In Seoul today, 600 Sogang University students tried to march to
a police station near their school after a campus rally protesting a
pre-dawn police raid on their school Friday to seize pro-North Korea
propaganda materials.
   About 1,000 riot police with interlocked shields blocked the
march and arrested about a dozen students. No injuries were reported.
   As part of a stepped-up crackdown on anti-government movements,
police raided the Jesuit-founded school and seized more than 2,000
propaganda materials for the 13th World Youth and Student Festival
to be held in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, in July 1-8.
   A radical South Korean campus group, the National Council of
Student Representatives, has vowed to take part in the festival in
defiance of a government ban. The festival is a sports and cultural
event mainly for students from the third world and communist nations.
   In Pusan, 200 miles southeast of Seoul, 800 university students
who oppose the government ban on the festival threw rocks at riot
police, the Yonhap News Agency said. Police fired tear gas to break
up the protests.
   No arrests or injuries were reported.
   President Roh, in his weekly radio address to the nation, said
the economy has suffered $4.5 billion in lost production so far this
year because of labor unrest. He said the losses included $1 billion
in lost exports.
   Roh urged industrial workers not to make ``excessive'' wage
demands.
   He said the competitiveness of Korean exports was declining
because of soaring costs and that Japan, Taiwan and other Asian
nations were benefitting from Seoul's economic problems.

   A hot-air balloon flying in tricky winds that
led another balloon owner to cancel two flights ran into a
television tower guy wire and fell ``like a sack of bricks,''
killing all three people aboard.
   The balloon fell 1,100 to 1,500 feet to the ground at 7:15 a.m.
Sunday, officials said.
   ``We didn't say anything to each other when we saw the balloon
flying so low,'' said Orlando Haley, 25, of Smithfield, who
witnessed the crash along with his brother, Dennis. ``We both knew
it was going to hit the tower.''
   The balloon ``dropped like a sack of bricks to the ground,'' said
Dennis Haley, 27. The brothers were the first to reach the crash
site.
   The victims, who were dead at the scene, were identified as the
pilot, Dan D. Johnson, 45, of Raleigh; Joseph James Tanahey, 32, of
Cary; and his wife, Margaret Angel Tanahey, whose age was not
available.
   Deputy D.C. Davenport said witnesses told him that when the
balloon hit the wires, ``it just tore the whole top out of that
balloon and it dropped straight down. It came down quick.''
   Ronald E. Brady, the co-owner of Aerial Ascensions, another
charter balloon company in Raleigh, said bad wind led his company to
cancel two flights Sunday morning.
   ``You develop a sixth sense, and I guess that's what we relied on
today,'' said Brady. ``It told us that something wasn't right and we
couldn't put our finger on it, so we didn't fly.''
   The National Weather Service at Raleigh-Durham International
Airport in Morrisville recorded surface winds of 8 mph at the time
of the accident.
   Brady said that's fine for launching a balloon, but he was
concerned about a low-level wind shear _ an abrupt change in wind
speed or direction _ detected in the 300- to 400-foot range.
``Because of that, we decided not to fly,'' he said.
   The tower whose wire was hit is owned by Durham Life Broadcasting
Co. for WPTF-TV and is one of three in the field where the crash
occurred. Guy wires on television towers can extend a quarter-mile
from the tower, officials said.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials are investigating the
crash, officials said.

<HEAD>Authorities Recover Priceless Artifacts Stolen From National Museum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have recovered scores of priceless
jade, gold and stone artifacts taken in the 1985 Chistmas Day
robbery of the National Museum of Anthropology, the federal attorney
general's office said.
   Federal agents found 133 of the 140 stolen treasures from the
ancient Mayan, Aztec, Zapotec and Mixtec civilizations in canvas
sacks stashed in a home in suburban Mexico City, the daily Excelsior
said.
   It said 10 people were arrested.
   The story was confirmed Sunday by an agent at the attorney
general's office. The agent, who requested anonymity, said experts
were authenticating the artifacts prior to an official announcement.
   The artifacts were recovered Saturday during a series of raids on
several residences in Mexico City, Excelsior said. It said Deputy
Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo, head of the narcotics
enforcement division, led the raids.
   Among the items recovered were a Zapotec mask of the bat god
Murielago and an obsidian Aztec sculpture of a monkey. Experts have
described them as two of the most valuable pieces in a museum
crammed with irreplaceable objects from civilizations dating back
thousands of years.
   Excelsior said the suspects arrested Saturday include two
brothers identified as the masterminds of the crime that stunned the
nation and led to an international search for the treasures looted
from seven display cases early Dec. 25, 1985.
   Many of the artifacts came from such important archeological
sites as Palenque in southern Mexico and Chicen-Itza on the Yucatan
Peninsula.
   Excelsior said authorities believe the loot has been in the same
place, a house in an affluent middle-class neighborhood called
Satellite, since it was stolen. Officials have long maintained that
many of the items were too well-known to be sold on the open market
and that they were still in Mexico.
   Excelsior said the recovered artifacts include a famous Mayan
turquoise mosaic, a Mixtec gold and conch shell necklace and several
other pieces of jewelry. It did not say anything about the seven
items that were not recovered.

<TEXT>
   The Moral Majority is being dismantled after a
decade of leading religious conservatives out of the political
wilderness, but analysts said the effects of its lobbying efforts
will endure.
   ``There are those that are saying we are witnessing the end of
the religious right,'' said the Rev. Richard Neuhaus, director of
the Center on Religion and Society in New York. ``I do not think
this is the beginning of the end. To paraphrase Churchill, `This is
the end of the beginning.'''
   Television evangelist Jerry Falwell, founder and chairman of
Moral Majority, announced Sunday that the organization will be
disbanded Aug. 31.
   The lobbying group, which raised $69 million and helped elect
three Republican administrations since its founding in June 1979,
had accomplished its mission of politicizing religious
conservatives, Falwell told a meeting of the Religion Newswriters
Association.
   ``I feel that I have performed the task to which I was called in
1979. The religious right is solidly in place, and like the
galvanizing of the black church as a political force a generation
ago, the religious conservatives in America are now in for the
duration,'' he said.
   Neuhaus, a Lutheran theologian, said Moral Majority's ability to
bring Christian fundamentalists out of an isolationist stance and
into public policy debates was ``a major development of lasting
consequence.''
   ``While the work of Moral Majority will go on forever, the Moral
Majority organization is no longer needed,'' Falwell said.
   An average of 2 million to 3 million people either donated money
or subscribed to the organization's newspaper over the last decade,
according to Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for Falwell.
   At its height during the 1984 presidential election, the group
raised $11 million. DeMoss said revenues this year are expected to
drop to $3.5 million. The organization has a dozen employees in
Washington.
   Sociologist Nancy Ammerman said the Moral Majority served an
important function for religious conservatives ``as a kind of
cultural symbol that they were gaining a place in the American
political scene.''
   But the group's passing is ``typical'' of social movements in
general that start out with charismatic leaders such as Falwell, but
in the long run need individuals on local boards to put policies in
place, she said.
   ``I've been seeing a movement over the last three or four years
away from the charismatic leader-type phase into the grass-roots
involvement phase,'' said Ms. Ammerman, an assistant professor of
the sociology of religion at Emory University in Atlanta.
   Falwell said the disbanding of the Moral Majority is part of his
continued withdrawal from politics to devote more time to his
ministry at Thomas Road Baptist Church and Liberty University in
Lynchburg, Va. He resigned as president of Moral Majority in
November 1987.
   Moral Majority's work will be taken over by the lobbying groups
of religious conservatives it helped pave the way for, such as the
American Coalition for Traditional Values, Concerned Women for
America, the Rutherford Institute, the Freedom Council, and the
American Family Association, Falwell said.
   Much of the political agenda of the religious right _ including
making abortion illegal, allowing tuition tax credits for private
schools and silent prayer in public schools _ remains unfulfilled.
   But Falwell credited the Moral Majority with registering
``millions'' of voters and leading religious conservatives in
electing Ronald Reagan, defeating a dozen liberal U.S. senators in
1980, re-electing Reagan in 1984 and electing Bush last year.
   He said the organization also helped place conservative judges
throughout the federal courts and successfully lobbied for
legislation such as the equal access bill, which permits student-run
religious groups to meet in public schools.

   The younger brother of boxer Thomas
Hearns has been arrested in the weekend shooting death of his
girlfriend at a home the boxer owns, the brother's attorney
confirmed.
   Henry Hearns, 22, was held on a preliminary charge of murder and
was scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon, his attorney, Neil
Fink, said late Sunday. The arraignment comes just hours before
Thomas Hearns' scheduled title fight with Sugar Ray Leonard in Las
Vegas.
   Tony Barile of Shelby Township identified the victim as his
sister, Nancy, 20, and said she was Henry Hearns' girlfriend, The
Detroit News reported in today's editions.
   Police and Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson refused
Sunday to identify the victim or confirm that Henry Hearns was a
suspect. Under Michigan law, a suspect's name is not released until
a formal warrant is signed by a judge, Thompson said.
   The suspect was arrested early Sunday, about 2{ hours after
witnesses reported the shooting, said officer Gary Conat, a
department spokesman.
   The victim's body was found in a bedroom of a home owned by
Thomas Hearns. She had been shot once in the head, and a handgun was
recovered at the scene, police Lt. Lloyd Collins said.
   Conat said the shooting stemmed from a ``domestic situation,''
but refused to elaborate. Police did not immediately know to whom
the handgun was registered, he said.
   Thomas Hearns remained in Las Vegas, where he was to meet Leonard
in a scheduled 12-round fight for Leonard's World Boxing Council
super middleweight title at Caesars Palace. Leonard is heavily
favored to win.
   Hearns is so consumed with avenging a 1981 loss to Leonard he has
little time to worry about the shooting, promoter Bob Arum said
Sunday from Las Vegas.
   Arum said the home where the shooting occurred was one of four
owned by Hearns and not the fighter's actual residence.
   Jackie Kallen, Hearns' publicist, said the fighter was in
seclusion, adding that was normal for the day before a fight.
Another publicist, John Totaro, said it was doubtful Hearns would
comment on the shooting before the fight.

<DATELINE>VINH PHU, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the scarred, denuded hills northwest
of Hanoi, Vietnam is waging another war, one scientists say may
prove as crucial to its survival as those against the French and
Americans.
   Over large tracts of Vinh Phu, experimental efforts are under way
to regenerate forests that once covered most of the hilly province
and to persuade farmers to mix cash crops with trees that bind and
fertilize the soil.
   The lessons learned may help attain a national objective:
increase tree cover in the next few decades from the current 20
percent to 50 percent. Vo Quy, the country's leading
conservationist, says while the plan may be over-ambitious, not
succeeding could spell disaster.
   According to Quy, a biologist who helped develop Vietnam strategy
for national conservation, forces threatening the underpinnings of
Vietnam are at work.
   About 40 percent of the country is being raked by erosion, with
water rushing off denuded hills and carrying away tons of vital
topsoil. Agricultural land is already scarce, and Vietnam's
population, now 60 million, is growing at 2.4 percent a year.
   ``This task of restoring our environment is the biggest and most
important challenge facing Vietnam today,'' Quy said upon accepting
an award last year from the Switzerland-based World Wildlife Fund.
   Forced for decades to worry about falling bombs and empty rice
bowls, the Vietnamese and their neighbors in Cambodia and Laos
largely ignored the mounting ecological mayhem around them.
   Vast forests became firewood, and the land was turned into rice
paddies; wildlife was slaughtered by foraging armies and hungry
civilians. In Vietnam, the United States unleashed a new form of
warfare: chemical defoliation to deny communist guerrillas vital
forest sanctuaries.
   The wars have ended in all but Cambodia, but peace and a recent
opening to the outside world pose new dangers. Eager for rapid
economic growth but unable to pay for it, the three countries find
that among their most saleable commodities are the remaining forests.
   Japanese loggers _ widely criticized for despoiling Southeast
Asia's tropical forests _ have already gained a foothold in
Cambodia. Thailand, which banned domestic logging this year after
ravaging its own forests, is hungry for its neighbors' timber.
   Indochinese officials say controls will be placed to prevent
exploitation by outsiders, but their statements sound optimistic in
light of experiences elsewhere in the Third World.
   Western environmentalists contend that Japanese and Thai loggers
will try to buy off anyone who tries to stop them from cutting down
the forests.
   ``We are destroying our environmental balance,'' said Chea Kong
of Cambodia's Agricultural Ministry, estimating forest cover has
shrunk from 73 to 50 percent in his country over the past decade.
   Eradication of ``flooded forests'' adjacent Cambodia's Tonle Sap
lake has wiped out many fish breeding grounds and, in part, accounts
for the dramatic drop in catch in recent years.
   In an unprecedented speech last month, Prime Minister Kaysone
Phomvihane of Laos said deforestation had reached a ``dangerous
level'' and called for a ban on logging for export. He blamed
drought and floods on the forest felling, which he described as a
``crime against the next generation.''
   In all three countries, the large herds of wild animals
remembered by older residents have vanished. Tiger, elephant, gaur
and gibbon are among the endangered species; the Sumatran rhinoceros
and tapir are extinct.
   Vietnam probably faces the greatest problems. Since World War II,
when about half the country was under tree cover, the forests have
dwindled steadily. According to the Vietnamese, about 4.9 million
acres of forest were destroyed by herbicides and other U.S. military
actions.
   But since the war ended in 1975, even more woodland has been
destroyed by human encroachment.
   Some of Vietnam's countermeasures appear impressive, given the
shattered economy and little foreign aid for conservation.
   Quy said more than half a billion trees are being planted each
year with every student in the country obliged to take part. About
90 parks and conservation areas have been established, and a search
has begun to capture and breed the kouprey, an endangered species of
wild cattle that has become a symbol to conservationists in
Southeast Asia.
   But across Indochina, the ax and the gun are hard to stop.
Tribespeople in Laos strip entire mountainsides through their
migratory slash-and-burn farming, a tactic that wreaks environmental
havoc worldwide.
   ``It was easier to mobilize and sacrifice during the war,'' said
To Thinh, a district chief in Vinh Phu. ``It is harder to mobilize
people to save the environment.''

<HEAD>Sudanese Government, Rebels Agree on Peace Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sudanese government and a rebel
group that has been fighting for autonomy for six years agreed
conditionally today on a constitutional conference in September to
end their civil war.
   In a joint statement, the sides set Sept. 18 for the start of the
conference but said it would have to be preceded by full
implementation of a pending peace agreement.
   That agreement was reached in November between the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army and the Democratic Unionist Party, a major
player in Sudan's coalition government.
   The pact caused a schism in the governing coalition and Prime
Minister Sadek Mahdi was forced to reshuffle his government earlier
this year under pressure from the army and professional groups.
   Although Mahdi has signaled his acceptance of the November peace
plan, Sudan's Parliament still has not formally endorsed it.
   The government and the rebel army said they would meet again in
Ethiopia's capital on July 4 to discuss ways to implement the
November accord and pave the way for the September conference.
   The joint statement was issued at the end of a two-day,
closed-door meeting between the sides, the first in the 6-year-old
war.
   No site was given for the constitutional conference, but the
statement said all Sudanese political parties would be invited to
participate.
   It appeared doubtful, however, that the militant National Islamic
Party would agree to take part in such a conference because it is
firmly opposed to a peace agreement with the Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   The Islamic Party, also a dominant partner in the former
government, left Mahdi's coalition after he indicated acceptance of
November's tentative peace accord.
   One of the sticking points to formal endorsement of the peace
proposal was a provision in the agreement calling for abrogation of
Sudan's defense pacts with Egypt and Libya. But on Sunday, the
government in Khartoum unexpectedly announced it had canceled those
pacts.
   In the joint statement, the sides ``agreed that the steps taken
by the governments of Sudan and Egypt to abrogate the joint defense
pact by mutual consent are positive and what remains is its
ratification by the Constituent Assembly.''
   But government and rebel delegations expressed differing views on
the Sudanese-Libyan defense protocol, with the insurgents
questioning whether Sudan could end it unilaterally without Libya's
consent.
   Lam Akol, the Sudan People's Liberation Army's director of
external affairs, noted that Libya has made no mention of the pact's
abrogation and said ``it is not clear if one side alone can cancel
it.''
   The organization considers the mutual defense agreements an
infringement on Sudanese sovereignity. Under a 1976 joint defense
treaty with Egypt, the countries are to aid each other in case of a
foreign attack. The agreement is one-sided in reality because of the
poor condition of the Sudanese army.
   Libya and Sudan signed a military cooperation pact in 1985, but
that too is one-sided, with Sudan receiving military aid and
equipment but contributing very little in return.
   Other points of the November peace initiative which remain to be
worked out are cancelation of Islamic law, which are opposed by the
rebels; lifting of a state of emergency; and the declaration of a
permanent truce.
   The guerrilla organization launched its rebellion in early 1983,
demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms in the three
southern provinces of Bahr Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria,
populated mainly by Christians and animists.

<HEAD>Egypt Offers to Mediate Between PLO and Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HERZLIYA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today
rejected Egypt's offer to serve as a mediator with the PLO to help
end the 18-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories.
   The offer came in a message to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir from
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. It was delivered in a private
meeting by the visiting Egyptian minister of state for foreign
affairs, Butros Ghali.
   Ghali is the only leading Egyptian official to visit Israel since
the start of the Palestinian uprising.
   ``I'm ready to be a good and active postman,'' Ghali told about
30 prominent Palestinians at a breakfast meeting in Herzliya.
   After 90 minutes of talks with Ghali in Jerusalem, Arens
responded that there was no need for a middleman and no desire for
talks with the PLO. Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO,
considering it a terrorist organization.
   ``There is no need for mediation,'' Arens said. ``I think the
Egyptians understand that we are convinced...that the peace process
needs to be advanced through direct negotiations and not through
mediation.''
   A senior Israeli official who requested anonymity said Shamir
told Mubarak's envoy he would welcome Egyptian efforts to persuade
Palestinians to accept Israel's plan for holding elections in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The PLO has rejected Shamir's plan, under
which Palestinians would elect non-PLO representatives to negotiate
limited autonomy for the occupied territories.
   ``Any positive influence Egypt could exert on the Palestinians
here would be beneficial,'' the official quoted Shamir as saying.
But he added the PLO was not a partner and, ``We don't need
mediation with them.''
   Asked about differences between the Egyptian and Israeli stance
toward the Palestine Liberation Organization, Arens said that Israel
sees the PLO as ``the major obstacle to progress for peace in the
area.''
   ``It is our position that anything which enhances the image of
the PLO is not a positive development in the peace process,'' Arens
said.
   Egypt is the only Arab country that maintains diplomatic ties
with Israel.
   Ghali also suggested Egypt's Embassy in Tel Aviv play a mediating
role between Palestinians and the PLO if such a move was requested
by Arabs in the occupied land, said Radwan Abu Ayash, head of the
Arab Journalists Association.
   Several prominent Palestinians did not attend the meeting. Some
said they received threats from radical PLO faction, while others
boycotted the session because it was held in Israel instead of in
Arab east Jerusalem.
   Also today, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported the army will
extend the maximum period under which Arabs can be jailed without
trial from six months to a year. Currently, 1,508 Palestinians are
being held without trial in Israeli detention centers and 5,000
Arabs have been held since the uprising began.
   The so-called administrative detention has been strongly
criticized by the United States as a violation of the right to due
process before the law.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Aspirin Maker in Wisconsin Reyes Syndrome
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
an aspirin manufacturer being sued for $10 million by the parents of
a child who contracted Reyes Syndrome.
   The court, without comment, let stand a Wisconsin judge's order
that the maker of Bayer aspirin reveal numerous company records.
   Sterling Drug Inc. said forcing it to turn over some of the
documents violates its free-speech and due-process rights.
   The documents include communications between the corporation and
its lawyers, and between the corporation and a trade association
called the Aspirin Foundation of America.
   A state judge in Milwaukee ruled last November that the company
was not entitled to withhold the documents.
   ``Release of this information will define and narrow the issues
to be tried, increase the chances for settlement and allow for a
fully informed resolution of the case,'' Judge Gary A. Gerlach said.
   Gary and Judith Fox sued Sterling Drug, alleging that their
daughter, Jacqueline, contracted Reyes Syndrome after taking Bayer
aspirin in October 1981 at the age of 10 months.
   Reyes Syndrome, first observed in the 1950s, causes severe
vomiting and lethargy and can lead to coma and death. It usually
occurs in children who have had a bout with a viral illness such as
influenza or chicken pox.
   The U.S. Center for Disease Control said in May that reported
cases of the syndrome reached their lowest level this year _ 20
cases _ since the syndrome was discovered.
   Aspirin containers were first required to carry warnings that
aspirin may cause Reyes Syndrome in 1986.
   The case is Sterling Drug vs. Circuit Court of Milwaukee, 88-1691.

   An armed mob in Uzbekistan tried to storm a refugee
camp where minority Turks sought safety from ethnic violence, but
troops killed two of the assailants and drove the others off, Pravda
reported today.
   In other weekend clashes in the Central Asian republic, a soldier
killed an attacker who tried to grab his gun in the city of
Margilan, and a military patrol fatally shot a motorcyclist and
injured another when one of them fired a sawed-off shotgun in the
city of Kokand, the official news agency Tass said today. Both
incidents occurred Sunday.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said troops killed one attacker
and injured another in Kokand on Saturday and shot to death a
motorist in Margilan who refused to stop.
   The rampage in the region has claimed the lives of 100 people,
most of them Meskhi Turks, and driven nearly 15,000 into primitive
refugee camps, official media say.
   More than 9,000 Interior Ministry troops brought into the Fergana
Valley have failed to halt attacks by increasingly well-organized
and armed gangs of marauders, officials said.
   Authorities have had to airlift hundreds of the refugees out of
danger.
   In a sign of extreme concern about the violence, the Communist
Party's ruling Politburo today dispatched Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
and former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov, the party's current top
law-and-order official, to the region, Tass reported.
   Col. Y. Nechayev of the Interior Ministry told Pravda that about
400 ``extremists'' mounted a column of vehicles Saturday evening and
tried to reach a camp housing almost 2,000 Meskhi Turk refugees in
the mountains near the city of Kokand, 1,500 miles southeast of
Moscow.
   Four helicopters full of soldiers landed in their path to stop
the column and two attackers were killed and five wounded in a
shootout, Pravda said. The remaining attackers escaped into the
darkness, it added.
   All 1,990 of the refugees in the attacked camp have been flown to
safer quarters in the central Soviet Union, Pravda said.
   The last time Soviet troops were reported to have killed
civilians in a clash with pro-independence protesters was in Georgia
on April 9. At least 20 people died in unrest in the southern
republic. Georgian activists have said the protesters were unarmed,
but the Uzbek mobs are reported to have automatic weapons,
firebombs, stones and pitchforks.
   Reports conflict over the reasons for the prolonged rioting. Much
of the violence has been directed against the Meskhi Turks, who were
forcibly deported to the area from their homeland in Georgia in
1944. But police stations, government buildings and stores have also
been attacked.
   Interior Ministry officials have blamed the attacks on outside
agitators who came pouring into the valley in cars and trucks.
Minister Vadim Bakatin called them opponents of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms, which have included a crackdown on high-level
corruption in Uzbekistan.
   Tass said attackers have carried signs with slogans reading
``Uzbekistan is for Uzbeks,'' ``Get Rid of Garbage,'' and ``We'll
Strangle Turks, We'll Strangle Russians. Long Live the Islamic
Banner.''
   The majority of Uzbeks are Moslems.
   Uzbek activists, however, point to rampant unemployment, harsh
living conditions in the impoverished cotton-growing republic and
worsening pollution as the deeper causes for the violence.
   Pravda today said that ``gangs of bandits, not even masquerading
any more under the guise of `nationalist zealots,' are continuing to
maraud, rob, burn and murder, not caring which nation's property''
they pillage.
   Rioters have set fire to hundreds of homes and other buildings,
leaving about 1,000 people injured.
   State-run television on Sunday night showed some of an estimated
14,500 Meskhi Turks housed at a camp huddled under canvas tents to
shelter them from the sun.
   A spokesman for the Turks interviewed on TV demanded their
``immediate evacuation'' from Soviet Central Asia to ``save our
people.''
   The government newspaper Izvestia said conditions are so hard in
the camp that ``some of the 20 babies born in the past week were
delivered on the bare ground.''
   The Turks have appealed repeatedly to the Kremlin to allow them
to return to their original territory in Georgia.
   The military newspaper Red Star said 136 Interior Ministry
soldiers have been injured since the disturbances began.
   The paper said the decision had been made to evacuate women and
children from the camp, and that 400 people had already been
airlifted to a children's camp operated by the Interior Ministry.

<HEAD>Court Leaves No-Suit Doctrine Intact in S.C. Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Turning away the case of a Marine who died
after his wisdom tooth was pulled, the Supreme Court today left
intact a legal doctrine that bars members of the military from suing
over injuries suffered ``incident to service.''
   The court, without comment, refused to reinstate lawsuits against
the government by the widow of Sgt. Timothy Adkins, whose death in
1985 sparked three separate investigations by the Marine Corps and
Navy.
   According to court records, Adkins, 26, died as a result of
having his tooth pulled in a dental clinic at the Marine Corps Air
Station in Beaufort, S.C.
   The tooth was pulled in June 1985. Adkins died Aug. 8.
   The suits filed by his widow, Gala, contend that Adkins' problems
began because the technician who assisted in the extraction failed
to realize that the machine used to sterilize the instruments was
not working.
   Adkins developed an infection that was treated unsuccessfully
with penicillin. He was hospitalized in Beaufort, then transferred
to the Charleston, S.C., Naval Hospital.
   Reporting on one investigation into Adkins' death, Rear Adm. John
Fetterman Jr., inspector general of the Navy, told Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio: ``The ultimate responsibility must be borne by a system
which allowed non-physician health care providers to admit a patient
on the serious list and schedule and perform subsequent surgery
without a medical evaluation by a credentialed physician.''
   Fetterman added, ``Sgt. Adkins was transferred to ... Charleston
so that a more sophisticated level of care could be delivered, and
this did not occur.''
   Mrs. Adkins' lawsuits were dismissed reluctantly last year by
U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins in Charleston, who cited a 1950
Supreme Court decision shielding the government from lawsuits by
injured military personnel.
   That decision, in a case called Feres vs. U.S., and its sequels
is known today as the Feres Doctrine.
   ``It is difficult to imagine a case less ripe for dismissal than
one in which (Adkins) died after having a tooth pulled, but Feres
and its progeny tie the court's hands,'' Judge Hawkins said.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his dismissal last
Feb. 2.
   In the appeal acted on today, the justices were urged to use
Adkins' case ``to overrule or limit the application of the Feres
Doctrine.''
   ``It should be noted that this case involves dental and medical
care ... under domestic, peacetime conditions,'' the appeal said.
   ``It is, to say the least, not easy to kill someone by pulling
their tooth,'' it added. ``The sequence of events flowing from the
removal of Sgt. Adkins' tooth and culminating in his paralysis, coma
and eventual death required the malfeasance, misfeasance and
nonfeasance of medical health care providers from three separate
military installations.''
   The Supreme Court last upheld the Feres Doctrine in a 1987
decision in which the justices voted 5-4 to bar families of military
personnel killed on duty from suing negligent federal employees who
took part in the military mission.
   Led by Justice Antonin Scalia, the four dissenters called the
1950 Feres decision a mistake that has caused ``unfairness and
irrationality.''
   The court's five-member majority in the 1987 case included
now-retired Justice Lewis F. Powell, whose seat was filled in 1988
by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Congress has considered various amendments to the Feres Doctrine,
which some members have contended treats members of the armed
services as ``second class citizens.''
   The case is Adkins vs. U.S., 88-1776.

<HEAD>Court Won't Block Extradition of Californian to Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to block the
extradition to Hong Kong of a California man accused of falsifying
accounts while chairman of a bank in the British crown colony.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that extraditing
the former bank official will violate his rights and could subject
him to additional prosecution when Hong Kong is returned to Chinese
control in 1997.
   Lawyers for Oen Yin Choy said the current unrest in China and the
prospect of civil war there underscore the urgency of his plight.
   Oen, 70, is an Indonesian citizen now living in an undisclosed
location south of San Francisco. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last October turned down his bid to avoid extradition.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that forcing Oen to return
to Hong Kong would violate a treaty between the United States and
Britain.
   The treaty bars anyone who is extradited from being turned over
to a third nation. It also prohibits the extradited individual from
being charged with any offense other than those for which he or she
has been extradited.
   Under a 1985 agreement between Great Britain and China, control
of Hong Kong will revert to China on July 1, 1997, when a 99-year
British lease expires.
   The 9th Circuit court said, ``Even if Oen becomes subject to
Chinese authority ... upon ... termination of the British lease of
Hong Kong, he will not have been extradited to China.''
   Oen also said the Chinese, in violation of the U.S.-British
treaty, could charge him with additional offenses based on his
alleged conduct as former chairman of the Union Bank of Hong Kong.
   But the appeals court said the treaty ``does not purport to
include commitments by successor governments or third states.''
   U.S. prosecutors contend that Oen embezzled $26.7 million that
was deposited in the Union Bank from 1975 to 1984. The prosecutors
said the money was supposed to be placed in accounts outside of Hong
Kong to produce tax benefits for the investors.
   Instead, the prosecutors charged, the money was used for other
bank purposes. Oen approved fictitious loans in 1984 to raise money
to repay some of the investors, according to the prosecutors.
   Oen, noting that Hong Kong officials have accused him of false
accounting, denied he embezzled the money.
   He also said his due-process rights were violated by the
extradition proceeding conducted by U.S. officials.
   Oen said translations from Chinese to English of witness
statements in his case are unreliable. He also said he was
unlawfully denied the right to cross-examine the government's
witnesses.
   The case is Oen vs. Robinson, 88-1481.

<TEXT>
   Two alligators reported missing from the
local zoo were apparently stolen, and the thieves had better keep
watch on their snapping jaws, authorities said today.
   ``They just don't get up in pairs and stroll out,'' said police
officer Judd Lezotte.
   The 4-foot American alligators, who live in a new outdoor pen,
were last seen at about midnight Saturday by a watchman. They were
discovered missing about eight hours later.
   ``They were in there all week and seemed very happy there,'' said
Gregg Cancho, acting director of Beardsley Zoological Gardens. The
alligators, which are native to the Southeast, would have had to
climb a 4{-foot-high wall to get out, an unlikely feat, Dancho said.
   ``One other possibility would have been for them to go out the
keeper's entrance, but they'd have to hop a 3-foot wall, walk around
and jump another 3-foot wall,'' Dancho said.
   He said the animals are dangerous and capable of biting off
fingers. The pair was near death three years ago when a local
resident, who had apparently brought them up from the South, donated
them to the zoo.

   Immigration authorities must decide whether
to grant political asylum to Chinese diplomats who said they were
defecting during an emotional vigil honoring pro-democracy students
slain in Beijing, the FBI said.
   The Consulate of the People's Republic of China would not confirm
the two men had defected, but FBI agents said the pair requested
asylum and were under federal protection Sunday.
   Agents referred the matter to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which decides asylum requests.
   A spokesman for David Ilchert, regional INS director, said Sunday
that the two had yet to file an asylum request, but he would provide
no other information.
   White House spokesman Bob Hall said in a telephone interview from
Washington that the Bush administration had no official statement
yet on the defections.
   At a Sunday rally organized by Chinese exchange students in
Oakland's Chinatown, some of the 300 demonstrators said they were
touched by the diplomats' actions.
   ``I was really moved when they said they are on our side,'' said
Yu Maochun, an exchange student from the University of California at
Berkeley. ``I am a Chinese national and I know how brave their
action is.''
   Elsewhere, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs announced
today that a Chinese diplomat has requested permission to stay in
Australia and his application was being considered by the government.
   A spokesman for the department, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, refused to disclose whether the official was based in the
Chinese Embassy in Canberra or one of China's consulates in
Melbourne or Sydney. It was not clear whether the officials was
seeking political asylum or refugee status.
   The Special Broadcasting Service Television News said the
official was one of China's 10 vice-consuls in the Sydney consulate.
   In San Francisco's Chinatown, posters began appearing in shop
windows Sunday printed with the words, ``The Unkillable Dream,'' and
reading in Chinese, ``Spread the torch of the fire of the student
movement all over,'' said David Chien, of the San Francisco-based
Chinese Alliance for Democracy.
   The posters depicting the goddess of democracy statue that stood
in Tiananmen Square before the crackdown were distributed by
students at Berkeley, Chien said.
   ``In my 43 years of life I've never seen Chinese so united and
being so vocal. We are being encouraged by the students who already
went to the front lines and sacrificed their lives,'' said Chien,
whose group is one of a coalition of San Francisco area Chinese
associations who have joined to assist the democracy movement in
China.
   Hundreds of protesters wept Saturday night as the diplomats made
a surprise public plea for political asylum at a candlelight vigil
outside City Hall.
   They told the stunned rally of 5,000 that they decided to defect
after Beijing leaders launched a propaganda campaign claiming no
citizens had died in the clash.
   The Chinese government has said nearly 300 people were killed
last week in Tianamen Square but that most were soldiers attacked by
``ruffians.'' Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources
have said as many as 3,000 may have died when troops fired on crowds
of citizens.
   ``We are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed.
Why? Because we are diplomats. But we won't fake it here. Before we
are diplomats, we are Chinese and we are human beings,'' said one of
the diplomats.
   Lee Man-kar, an editor at San Francisco's Chinese Times, on
Sunday identified the two from their business cards as Zhou Li-ming,
26, vice consul for cultural affairs, and Zhang Li-man, 25, acting
consul for overseas affairs. He said both had been in the United
States for 2{ years and were unmarried.
   Humphrey Wou, a member of the Chinese Christian Mission, one of
the sponsors of Saturday's rally, said he saw several San Francisco
police officers crying after the men spoke.
   He said the diplomats told him they had walked to the rally after
finishing dinner at the consulate, about a half-mile away.
   Along the way, they stopped at a public telephone and called the
FBI, and agents escorted them from the rally afterward.

   The husband of a woman who was detained with her
baby in China for five days called her safe return to the United
States ``the end of a nightmare.''
   Yu Cheng, 30, savored her first full day back with her husband,
Sanyuan Li, Sunday and appeared at a rally of about 200 people at
Chicago's Chinatown.
   Ms. Cheng was detained for five days last week after arriving in
Beijing to join pro-democracy demonstrators. She was delivering
money raised by Chinese students in the United States to the student
leaders in China.
   She said she was well treated, but very concerned for her safety
and that of her 18-month-old son, Payton Li, who is a U.S. citizen.
Ms. Cheng and her husband are Chinese nationals.
   ``For the fight for freedom and democracy in China it's going to
be a very, very long struggle,'' said Ms. Cheng, a doctoral
candidate in education at the University of Chicago. She said
authorities questioned her about her involvement in the movement.
   Ms. Cheng, her husband and child all wore black swatches pinned
to their sleeves to symbolize mourning for the students who have
died in the 7-week uprising in China.
   ``I'm so happy,'' Sanyuan Li said of the return of his wife and
child. ``This is the end of a nightmare.''
   Also Sunday, 17 students from Northern Illinois University and 15
professors from Illinois State University returned safely from China.
   ``Demonstrations are still strong outside of Beijing,'' said
Thomas Heaney, director of NIU's Lindeman Center in Chicago. ``We
saw students demonstrating in every single city we were in.''

<TEXT>
   Rebels attacked an airport in northern
Afghanistan, killing 300 government soldiers during a raid in which
a large ammunition dump blew up, the guerrilla news service said
today.
   The Moslem guerrillas _ known as the mujahedeen, or Islamic
``holy warriors'' _ launched the attack in early June on the airport
at Mazar-i-Sharif, the insurgents' Afghan News Agency said.
   The city is the capital of northern Balkh province and a major
military base of Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government.
   During the fighting, 7,400 tons of ammunition stored in a depot
exploded, destroying weaponry, vehicles and 170 tanks, the agency
said. It said it was unclear if the arsenal was exploded by the
rebels or if it was sabotaged to keep weapons out of guerrilla hands.
   About 300 government troops were killed in the blast and
subsequent fighting, the agency reported.
   It was not possible to independently confirm the guerrilla report.
   Battlefield claims by each side are difficult to verify, and
casualty counts frequently are released several days after clashes.
   Mazar-i-Sharif, 35 miles south of the Soviet border, is the major
military supply hub for Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   Guerrilla and Western diplomatic sources say the communist
government has prepared the city as a fallback position in the event
Kabul is taken by the rebels, who are backed primarily by Pakistan
and the United States.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami
rebel group, told civilians Sunday to evacuate the southeastern city
of Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest, before an imminent
guerrilla attack.
   Communist government forces still hold the country's major cities
following the withdrawal earlier this year of Soviet troops helping
the Marxist government. But the guerrilla fighters have control of
most of the countryside.
   A commander in Hekmatyar's group issued a similar warning to
Kabul citizens in May, but the offensive has yet to materialize.
   Guerrilla sources who demanded anonymity said rebel leaders plan
to focus their firepower mainly on eastern Afghan cities near the
Pakistan border.
   Capture of a major eastern city would provide a capital for the
guerrillas' government-in-exile and provide them a staging base for
their ultimate objective, Kabul.
   But Jalalabad, the guerrillas' first target just 40 miles from
the Pakistan frontier, remains in government hands despite three
months of rebel attacks.
   The rebels want to rid the country of Marxists and establish an
independent, Islamic republic of Afghanistan. They have rejected
repeated peace overtures from the Kabul government.
   Pakistan, which shelters more than 3 million Afghan war refugees,
and the United States have announced they will continue supporting
the guerrillas but with an eye to pursuing a political solution of
the war.
   Hard-line guerrilla leaders such as Hekmatyar along with and
hawks in Islamabad and Washington advocate fighting on for a
military victory.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations today flew 150
Namibians back to their homeland at the start of an airlift that
eventually will bring thousands of refugees home for November
independence elections.
   The passengers, mostly women and children, arrived on a Zambian
Airways DC-10 from Lusaka, Zambia. After immigration formalities at
the airport, they will be reunited with their families and sent to
their home villages.
   Officials say it will cost $39 million to bring the refugees back
for the election campaign, which begins July 1, and the November
elections. Both will be held under a U.N.-sponsored peace treaty
granting te Namibia independence.
   One U.N. official, Nicolas Bwakira, said the refugees who
returned today were ``in good health and they are all very happy.''
   Many Namibians fled their homeland to Angola and Zambia over the
years to escape the bush war for control of Namibia. Under a
regional peace treaty signed in December, South Africa agreed to end
its 74-year rule of the territory in return for Cuba withdrawing its
estimated 50,000 troops from Angola where they fought alongside
government forces.
   U.N. officials had expected 1,300 refugees to arrive today in
Windhoek and at northern Namibian air bases in Ondanga and
Grootfontein.
   But one flight from Luanda, Angola, to Grootfontein was
reportedly canceled, and the officials said only 700 arrivals were
expected today. Two planes carrying refugees' belongings were to
arrive from Angola and Zambia.
   The first refugee to disembark from the Zambian plane was a
17-year-old. He was greeted on the tarmac at Windhoek International
Airport by Bwakira, who asked him if he was glad to be back.
   ``I'm glad to be home, yes,'' said the boy.
   Several of the young men sang freedom songs as they walked toward
the terminal building. The two dozen children on the plane carried
blankets and orange-colored plates and cups given to them in Zambia.
   The United Nations has registered 41,000 Namibian exiles _ most
of them in Angola and Zambia _ who want to return home. In addition
to the airlift, hundreds of refugees are crossing the border from
Angola on foot, Namibian officials have said.
   Most exiles are supporters or members of the South-West African
People's Organization, which fought a 23-year guerrilla war against
South African control of Namibia.
   As the Zambian Airways plane landed, 200 people dressed in the
SWAPO colors of blue, red and green chanted slogans supporting the
SWAPO guerrilla fighters.
   Namibians who turned out to greet the refugees held up banners
reading: ``Welcome Home SWAPO Freedom Fighters.''
   SWAPO is favored to win November elections, but they will need a
two-thirds' majority in order to control the new government. No
formal date has been set for independence but it will likely be
early next year.
   The arlift was delayed for a month, when an unscheduled border
crossing by hundreds of SWAPO fighters interrupted the peace plan on
April 1, the day it was to begin.
   More than 300 SWAPO fighters, and 27 security force officials
died in the subsequent fighting, until SWAPO recalled the fighters
to Angola.
   Further delays were caused by disagreements over an amnesty for
exiles accused of crimes before the left and the repeal of
discriminatory legislation that might affect free and fair elections.

<HEAD>Companies Involved in Treating Hazardous Waste Lose Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies involved in treating hazardous waste
today lost a Supreme Court appeal aimed at forcing the government to
adopt tougher environmental rules.
   The court, without comment, refused to let the firms sue for
stricter standards that could increase their business volume or give
them a competitive advantage over other waste-treatment companies.
   The justices, instead, let stand a ruling that denies the
companies legal standing to sue in such cases.
   The case prompted an unusual alliance between business and
environmental groups.
   The appeal by the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, representing
leading treatment firms and makers of advanced technology treatment
equipment, was supported by such prominent environmental groups as
the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation and
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   The environmental groups, noting their own limited finances and
technical capabilities, said they welcome legal standing for
industry groups wishing to fight, for whatever motive, for a cleaner
environment.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled against the
waste-treatment companies last October.
   The appeals court said the companies generally may not challenge
as too lax the rules adopted by the federal Environmental Protection
Agency for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste.
   For example, the companies sought stricter deadlines and
standards for cement kilns used to burn liquid hazardous wastes.
   The Hazardous Waste Treatment Council said lax EPA regulations
reduce the market for high-tech control devices that council members
make and use. The council also said the rules permit the use of
waste treatment facilities inadequate to protect the environment.
   The appeals court said the council may not invoke federal
environmental law to enlist the government's support for rules that
would enhance company profits.
   Also, the appeals court said, ``A firm has no common law
interest, much less a constitutional one, in having government drive
business its way or in having government force competitors' services
to be of the same quality (and cost) as its own.''
   The appeals court also said permitting companies to sue in such
cases could have unintended consequences. For example, requiring
more advanced recycling techniques, ironically, could hurt the
environment by prompting users to substitute more harmful fuels, the
appeals court said.
   It said the only time the waste-treatment companies may sue for
stricter rules is to protect themselves as consumers _ when they
purchase recycled oil for their own use, for example.
   The case is Hazardous Waste Treatment Council vs. Environmental
Protection Agency, 88-1532.

<HEAD>Parliament Asks New Premier About Geisha Relationship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, peppered with questions
by Parliament about allegations that he paid a geisha to be his
mistress, maintained a steadfast silence today on what he said was a
personal matter.
   Uno, chosen as Japan's prime minister less than two weeks ago
because of his scandal-free background, repeatedly said he would not
comment in Parliament on the charges.
   ``This problem is a private problem, not one to discuss in this
kind of setting,'' Uno, 66, answered one of three people who
questioned him about the matter in a session of the lower house
Budget Committee.
   Last week, the magazine Sunday Mainichi broke with Japanese
journalistic tradition and published a story quoting an anonymous
40-year-old woman as saying Uno paid her 300,000 yen, about $2,100,
a month for four months in 1985 to be his mistress.
   The magazine's editor-in-chief, Shuntaro Torigoe, said he decided
to print the article about the prime minister's private life because
he wanted to raise the issue of social ethics in politics.
   Questioners from the Socialist, Democratic Socialist and
Communist parties pressed Uno today to answer questions about the
story and said reports of the case were damaging Japan's
international reputation.
   At first, Japanese newspapers and television stations gave little
coverage to the Sunday Mainichi report. But article in overseas
newspapers and the unprecedented questioning of Uno about the report
by a Socialist lawmaker in Parliament on Friday prompted a stream of
stories and attempts by a host of reporters to confirm the account.
   Japanese news reports today said the governing Liberal Democratic
Party was worried the issue would cost it votes, especially among
women, in an election for half of Parliament's upper house this
summer.
   The party still is attempting to recover from the Recruit Co.
bribery scandal that forced former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
and three Cabinet members to resign and plunged the party's
popularity to all-time lows.
   Several prominent officials or their aides were accused of
purchasing stock in a Recruit subsidiary at low prices, then making
handsome profits when the stock went public. Recruit also allegedly
attempted to influence officials with campaign donations.
   Eiichi Nakao, chairman of the Budget Committee, chastised the
questioners today for not following provisions in the Parliament law
that forbid impolite and personal questions.
   ``This is not a personal matter,'' said Mitsuo Higashinaka, a
communist lawmaker. ``Everywhere in the world there are standards
for the morals of politicians.''
   The Sunday Mainichi quoted the woman as saying Uno was
``selfish'' and ``bullied'' the woman who ran the geisha house where
she worked.
   ``He is not a man of noble character,'' she was quoted as saying.
``He thinks he can buy woman for money. I don't want him to use
politics in the same way he treated me.''
   The woman said Uno broke off the relationship but still wanted to
be able to meet her for a fee, the magazine said.
   Despite their reputation overseas, real geishas are not
prostitutes but highly trained entertainers versed in the arts and
in conversation. Most work in traditional Japanese restaurants,
where a majority of the guests are male, and some may become the
mistresses of favored patrons.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Death Penalty Issue in South Carolina Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury choosing between the death penalty and a
life prison term for a convicted murderer generally may not be told
about the victim's personal characteristics, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that a South Carolina murderer
unfairly was sentenced to death after a prosecutor told jurors that
the victim was a religious, community-minded person.
   The decision marked a second key setback in the nation's highest
court for the so-called victims' rights movement, which seeks to
have sentencing courts take into account a crime's impact on the
victim and his or her family.
   Writing for the court today, Justice William J. Brennan said a
defendant's sentence, whether the death penalty or not, cannot be
based on factors of which the defendant was unaware.
   Brennan's opinion relied heavily on the court's 1987 decision in
which ``victim impact statements'' were barred from sentencing
trials.
   The court's four dissenters in the South Carolina case decided
today, however, said they are ready to overturn the 1987 decision.
   Justice Byron R. White, a dissenter in the 1987 case, proved to
be the decisive vote in the South Carolina case as he sided with
Brennan.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul
Stevens completed the court's majority.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.
   Demetrious Gathers was convicted of a 1986 killing in a
Charleston, S.C., city park. He killed Richard Haynes, 32, during an
attack in which Haynes was beaten and stabbed.
   At Gathers' sentencing trial, a state prosecutor focused on
Hayne's characteristics. The prosecutor, in his closing argument,
told jurors that among the things found at the murder scene were
various religious items and a voter registration card belonging to
Haynes.
   ``We know from the proof that ... Haynes was a religious person
... (he) believed in this community. He took part,'' the prosecutor
said.
   The South Carolina Supreme Court said those statements deprived
Gathers of a fair sentencing trial, and today's decision upheld that
ruling.
   ``The fact that Gathers scattered Haynes' personal papers around
his body while going through them looking for something to steal was
certainly a relevant circumstance of the crime, and thus a proper
subject for comment,'' Brennan said.
   ``But the prosecutor's argument in this case went well beyond
that fact: he read to the jury at length from the religious tract
the victim was carrying'' and commented on the voter registration
card, Brennan said.
   ``The content of these cards cannot possibly have been relevant
to the circumstances of the crime,'' Brennan said.
   The case is South Carolina vs. Gathers, 88-305.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Decision Expanding Indian Water Rights at Fort Mohave
Reservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An evenly divided Supreme Court today upheld a
federal government decision that effectively expanded Indian water
rights at the Fort Mohave Reservation in Arizona and California.
   By a 4-4 vote, the justices automatically affirmed a federal
appeals court ruling that threw out challenges by officials from
both states.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall did not participate in the case for
unannounced reasons. Announcement of the 4-4 vote came in a
one-sentence opinion.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1987 ruled that the U.S.
Department of the Interior correctly added 3,500 acres to the
reservation, an action that had the effect of increasing the
reservation's share of water from the Colorado River.
   Joining the two state governments in challenging that ruling were
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the
Coachella Valley Water District in California.
   Both water districts are run by public corporations that store
and deliver water to other public agencies for municipal and
residential use.
   The state and water district officials said the adjustment of the
reservation's boundaries illegally deprived them of their fair share
of Colorado River water.
   They said the amount of water at stake is enough to serve about
500,000 people for a year.
   The 9th Circuit court ruled that the federal government is immune
from being sued in federal courts in this case.
   ``To allow this suit would permit third parties to interfere with
the government's discharge of its responsibilities to Indian tribes
in respect to the lands it holds in trust for them,'' the appeals
court had ruled.
   The case is California vs. U.S., 87-1165.

<HEAD>Three White ANC Members Plead Guilty To Terrorism Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three white members of the main
guerrilla group trying to overthrow the white-run government in
South Africa pleaded guilty today to 10 counts of terrorism.
   The members of the outlawed African National Congress were
acquitted of 16 other charges, including 14 counts of attempted
murder linked to the March, 1988, bombing of a military passenger
bus.
   The so-called Broederstroom Three were arrested on May 8, 1988,
at a farmhouse in Broederstroom near Pretoria where, according to
police, they had amassed the largest guerrilla arms chache ever
found in South Africa.
   The three are Damien Michael de Lange, 31, a former journalist
who was born in Zambia; Ian Robertson, 37, a South African who
allegedly received guerrilla training in the Soviet Union; and Susan
Donelly, 24, a British subject who allegedly was the unit's
communications specialist. The 16 charges they were acquitted on
included terrorism and illegal possession of weapons.
   Attorneys said sentencing would begin Tuesday.
   It was not known why the three defendants pleaded guilty shortly
after their trial began, but a fourth person arrested with them,
Hugh Lugg, reportedly a government infiltrator, was believed ready
to testify as a state witness. Lugg did not appear in court today
and was not charged.
   A fifth African National Congress member, Paul Annegarn, fled the
country.
   The three pleaded guilty in the bus bombing and to setting a bomb
that destroyed an electricity pylon and a communications antenna.
   They also pleaded guilty to belonging to an outlawed
organization, taking part in the organization's activities,
receiving weapons and explosives, and unlawful possession of hand
grenades.
   The African National Congress was banned in 1961, and a year
later Nelson Mandela formed its military wing. Mandela is now
serving a life prison term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow
the white minority government. Although the ANC is a multiracial
organization, the arrest of white guerrillas is rare.
   The ANC sabotage campaign, including attacks on police and black
township official, has increased since a nationwide state of
emergency was imposed four years ago. About 200 bombings have killed
35 people and injured more than 680.

<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old has become the fifth
Florida youngster shot this month while they or companions played
with guns, but an aide said the governor was reluctant to put a
gun-safety bill before the legislature this week.
   Silvio Pierre was listed in very critical condition at Tampa
General Hospital today after shooting himself in the chest Sunday,
police and hospital officials said. Hospital spokesman Marc Kutash
said the boy was in surgery for nearly seven hours.
   The child had found his father's .25-caliber pistol under a couch
while playing in the family's apartment, said Police Cpl. Gary
Bradford. He said the father, Clotaire Pierre of Tampa, was being
interviewed but no charges had been filed.
   Two of the recent shooting victims died. Last week, when the
number of shootings reached four, Rep. Harry Jennings resubmitted a
gun-safety bill that calls for prison terms for people who fail to
keep loaded guns out of the reach of children.
   Jennings asked Gov. Bob Martinez to include his legislation on
his agenda if he called a special session on a plan to expand
Florida's Turnpike.
   Martinez, who was expected to announce a session decision early
this week, said Saturday he would consider it, but doubted he would
widen the session's scope so lawmakers wouldn't be diverted from the
turnpike issue.
   Sunday's shooting may not have changed that, said Jon Peck, the
governor's press secretary. ``He'll certainly give it additional
thought, and he was considering it before. That doesn't mean he's
going to do it.
   ``I do know that he is deeply concerned about all these shootings
and recognizes that the primary responsibility rests with parents to
keep their guns out of the way,'' Peck said.
   The House passed Jennings' bill during the last session but the
Senate didn't take it up.
   Under the bill, leaving a firearm in a place accessible to a
child would be a misdemeanor. The offense would be a felony if the
person who made the gun available was negligent and the child died
or was permanently disfigured. The bill would require that guns be
secured with a trigger lock or stored in a locked container.
   Earlier this month, a 10-year-old Orlando boy was killed by a
playmate; an 8-year-old Miramar girl was killed by her 13-year-old
brother who thought his father's gun was unloaded; a 4-year-old
Orlando girl was wounded in the neck when her 6-year-old brother
dropped a pistol; and a 9-year-old Tampa boy was wounded by his
13-year-old brother as they played with a handgun.
   Linda Booz, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement, said statistics on such shootings are generally not
kept by her agency, so no one could say for sure if the spate of
child shootings was as unusual as it seemed.
   ``The only thing we would have would be negligent manslaughter,''
she said. ``That would not include accidental shootings.''

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a major setback for
affirmative action, today expanded the ability of white men to
challenge court-approved plans giving preferential treatment to
minorities and women in government jobs.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices handed civil rights advocates their
latest defeat in the case of white Birmingham, Ala., firefighters
who say they are victims of reverse discrimination.
   The justices said an affirmative action plan agreed to by public
officials and approved in court may be attacked even years later in
a new suit by workers who took no part in the case leading to the
original agreement.
   Today's ruling marks the third time this year a newly solidified
high court conservative majority has dealt a significant blow to
efforts aimed at helping minorities and women overcome bias.
   The court in January ruled that state and local governments
generally may not impose racial quotas for public works projects. On
June 5, the justices erected new barriers for minorities seeking to
prove with statistics that they are relegated to lower paying, less
desirable jobs.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court,
dismissed arguments that the ruling threatens voluntary settlement
of minority employment discrimination claims.
   ``A voluntary settlement in the form of a (court) consent decree
between one group of employees and their employer cannot possibly
settle, voluntarily or otherwise, the conflicting claims of another
group of employees who do not join in the agreement,'' he said.
   ``A judgment or decree among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues
as among them, but it does not conclude the rights of strangers to
those proceedings,'' he said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
ruling could have serious consequences for affirmative action plans
agreed to by employers.
   The decision ``would subject large employers who seek to comply
with the law by remedying past discrimination to a never-ending
stream of litigation and potential liability,'' Stevens said.
   He said the ruling threatens to undo efforts by Birmingham which
``has made a substantial step toward the eradication of the long
history of pervasive racial discrimination that has plagued its fire
department.''
   Stevens was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A.
Blackmun and Thurgood Marshall.
   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that a jury choosing between the death penalty and a life
prison term for a convicted murderer generally may not be told about
the victim's personal characteristics.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that a South Carolina murderer
unfairly was sentenced to death after a prosecutor told jurors that
the victim was a religious, community-minded person.
   _ Agreed to decide whether manufacturers legally may give some
discounts to wholesalers but not retailers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Texaco Inc., ordered to
pay $1.38 million in antitrust damages to 12 service stations in the
Spokane, Wash., area.
   _ Turned down an appeal by companies involved in treating
hazardous waste aimed at forcing the government to adopt tougher
environmental rules.
   The court, without comment, refused to let the firms sue for
stricter standards that could increase their business volume or give
them a competitive advantage over other waste-treatment companies.
   _ Rejected an appeal by an aspirin manufacturer being sued for
$10 million by the parents of a child who contracted Reyes Syndrome.
   The court, without comment, let stand a Wisconsin judge's order
that the maker of Bayer aspirin reveal numerous company records.
   _ Made it easier to recover lawyers' fees for people who win
disputes with the government over Social Security benefits.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the government must reimburse legal
fees incurred during administrative proceedings that a federal court
has ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct.
   _ Refused to let Montana sheep owners kill grizzly bears
threatening their herds.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that the
owners have a constitutional right to protect their property _ even
if it means killing animals designated an endangered species.
   _ Turned away the case of a Marine who died after his wiscom
tooth was pulled, and left intact a legal doctrine barring members
of the military from suing over injuries suffered ``incident to
service.''
   The court, without comment, refused to reinstate lawsuits against
the government by the widow of Marine Sgt. Timothy Adkins, whose
death in 1985 sparked three separate investigations by the Marines
and Navy.
   The Birmingham case began in 1974 when city officials and the
Jefferson County Personnel Board were sued by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and blacks
charging racial bias in the city fire department.
   Eventually both sides reached agreement on an extensive plan that
includes long-term and interim goals for hiring blacks as
firefighters and promoting blacks to higher ranks. The plan also
included provisions to help women advance.
   The Birmingham Firefighters Association opposed the plan. But its
objections were rejected by a federal judge who issued consent
decrees in 1981 approving the agreement.
   At the time, the city's 453 firefighters included 42 blacks. None
of the department's 140 lieutenants, captains or battalion chiefs
was black.
   Seven white firefighters then challenged the promotion plan,
saying less-qualified blacks were being promoted ahead of them.
   A federal judge ruled that the white firefighters were bound by
the court consent decree and dismissed their suit.
   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in late 1987
reinstated the suit, sparking an appeal to the Supreme Court by the
city and county officials and those who filed the 1974 suit.
   In a similar case last year, the justices split 4-4 in upholding
a New York City affirmative action plan for promoting more blacks
and Hispanics in the city.
   Kennedy, the court's newest member, did not participate in that
case.
   The former Reagan administration sided with the white Birmingham
firefighters even though the Justice Department had joined in the
1974 suit on the side of those alleging bias against minorities. The
government's position was staked out prior to the Bush
administration taking office.
   The case is Martin vs. Wilks, 87-1614.

recover lawyers' fees for people who win disputes with the
government over Social Security benefits.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the government must reimburse legal
fees incurred during administrative proceedings that a federal court
has ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct.
   The decision is a victory for Elmer Hudson, an Alabama woman who
won disability benefits in a dispute with the government.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her opinion for the court, said
requiring the award of legal fees in such cases is in keeping with a
federal law _ the Equal Access to Justice Act _ giving lawyers an
incentive to represent the needy.
   The law demands reimbursement of legal fees for more than just
court proceedings, she said.
   ``We find it difficult to ascribe to Congress an intent to throw
the Social Security claimant a lifeline that it knew was a foot
short,'' said O'Connor.
   She was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   White, in an opinion joined by the other dissenters, said the
court misread the law.
   ``Our duty is to apply statutes as they were enacted by Congress,
not to take it upon ourselves to overcome the political realities
that blocked what we might consider to be good legislation,'' he
said.
   The case began when Mrs. Hudson filed a Social Secuirty
disability claim in September 1981. She said a variety of physical
and emotional ailments prevented her from continuing to work as a
maid and janitor.
   An administrative law judge of the Health and Human Services
agency denied her claim, ruling that none of Mrs. Hudson's ailments
was so severe as to render her disabled.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the decision in
1985. The appeals court said Mrs. Hudson's impairments must be
considered in combination and sent the case back to the Health and
Human Services agency.
   An administrative law judge then determined she was disabled
since May 1981 and granted her benefits.
   The 11th Circuit court last year said the government now must
reimburse Mrs. Hudson for attorneys' fees she incurred during the
second round of administrative proceedings.
   The former Reagan administration, before it left office in
January, asked the Supreme Court to reverse the appeals court ruling.
   Justice Department lawyers argued that the administrative
proceedings ordered by the 11th Circuit court were not adversarial
in the way that court proceedings are and therefore said legal fees
should not be recoverable.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Hudson, 88-616.

   A twin-engine plane with 11 people aboard
disappeared on what was to have been an hourlong tour of the
Hawaiian Islands, and searchers used helicopters and boats to look
for the plane, the Coast Guard said today.
   The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Point Harris searched overnight
through the channel separating Hawaii Island and Maui Island for the
Scenic Air Tour Hawaii plane that disappeared Sunday afternoon.
   The Coast Guard was concentrating its search for the plane off
the northeast coast of Hawaii Island, the last confirmed location of
the airplane, said Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Robert
Bennett.
   Bennett said the Coast Guard received information from Federal
Aviation Administration radar tapes confirming the twin-engine
Beechcraft had left Hilo International Airport on the east side of
Hawaii Island and headed up the island's northeast coast.
   The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an FAA
ground station that he had taken off from Hilo for Maui's Kahului
Airport, said the FAA's George Harvey.
   The plane was to have toured Hawaii Island, including erupting
Kilauea Volcano, before flying on to Maui, said David Tom, a Scenic
Air Tours Hawaii reservationist in Honolulu.
   Tom, who declined to identify the pilot, said the 10 passengers
aboard the plane had set out earlier Sunday from Honolulu on Oahu
Island. He said they were probably tourists.
   Search efforts Sunday included a Coast Guard C-130 search and
rescue plane and a helicopter, two helicopters provided by the Maui
Fire Department and four Scenic Air Tour Hawaii planes, said Bennett.
   Civil Air Patrol planes and a Coast Guard helicopter were to join
the search when it resumed this morning, Bennett said.
   Hawaii police were also asked to check a section of the island
the pilot was known to fly over during tours, Bennett said. Hilo
police Sgt. Prentiss Morino said ground searches Sunday turned up
nothing and police were to resume looking later today.
   Air strips on the neighboring island also were checked in case
the pilot made a landing without informing the FAA, Harvey said.
   No rains were reported on the two islands Sunday, which had party
sunny skies with low scattered clouds and 15 to 20 mph winds, the
National Weather Service office said. Alenuihaha Channel, which the
plane would have had to cross to get to Maui Island, had 5- to
6-foot seas, it said.
   In December 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with
eight people aboard disappeared on flight from Honolulu to Molokai
Island. No trace of the plane or those aboard was found.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Montana Sheep Owners Kill Grizzly Bears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let Montana
sheep owners kill grizzly bears threatening their herds.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that the
owners have a constitutional right to protect their property _ even
if it means killing animals designated an endangered species.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case but
four votes are needed to grant such review.
   The case stemmed from an incident involving Richard Christy, who
owned 1,700 head of sheep grazing on land near Glacier National Park
in Montana.
   Christy said that in July 1982 bears began attacking his herd on
a nightly basis.
   A herder employed by Christy had only limited success in
frightening the bears away with fires and by shooting into the air.
   Christy also sought help from Kenneth Wheeler, a trapper working
for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Wheeler set snares to
capture the bears, but by July 9, 1982, bears had killed about 20
sheep worth at least $1,200.
   That night Christy fatally shot a grizzly after it emerged from
the forest and moved toward his herd.
   Two weeks later, having lost 84 sheep to the bears, Christy
removed his herd from the land he had leased from the Blackfeet
Indian Tribe. The tribe refunded money Christy paid them to lease
the land. Christy said he was forced to sell the flock at slaughter
value and lost more than $10,000.
   The Department of the Interior fined Christy $2,500 for violating
the federal Endangered Species Act. Grizzlies are protected under
the law.
   Christy then sued the government, claiming the law
unconstitutionally deprived him of his property. He was joined by
two other sheep owners, Thomas Guthrie and Ira Perkins of Teton
County, Mont.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September upheld a
federal judge's ruling dismissing the suit.
   ``We decline plaintiffs' invitation to construe the Fifth
Amendment as guaranteeing the right to kill federally protected
wildlife in defense of property,'' the appeals court said.
   The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution bars the government from
confiscating private property without just compensation.
   The appeals court said the Endangered Species Act reasonably
requires livestock owners to seek help from the government ``rather
than leaving every individual free to kill a nuisance bear whenever
he or she deems it necessary.''
   The sheep owners said the regulation is unreasonable because, as
in Christy's case, when the government is incapable of helping there
is no recourse for them.
   They also argued that the law is irrational because it permits
sportsmen to kill up to 25 grizzlies annually in some designated
areas.
   But the 9th Circuit court said that rule is reasonable because it
is ``a carefully controlled seasonal hunt'' aimed at reducing
regional over-population of grizzlies.
   The appeals court said the sheep owners ``contend that by
protecting grizzly bears the Department (of Interior) has
transformed the bears into `governmental agents' who have physically
taken the plaintiffs' property.''
   ``Undoubtedly the bears have physically taken the plaintiffs'
property, but the plaintiffs err in attributing such takings to the
government,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeal acted on today was supported by, among others, the
American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattlemen's
Association, the American Sheep Industry and sheep owners in
Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.
   The case is Christy vs. Lujan, 88-1461.

<HEAD>Burmese Troops Reported Killed in Attack on Rebel Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karen guerrillas held off a fierce
Burmese assault on a jungle stronghold near the Thai border today,
and 80 Burmese troops were killed in the battle, rebel sources said.
   Heavy fighting was reported after 1,500 Burmese troops met with
stiff resistance as they battled 700 guerrillas in the Pa Loo rebel
camp.
   Shells and mortar rounds rained down on the camp beginning early
today, but the shooting diminished as evening fell.
   Burmese troops also attacked Pa Loo on Sunday. The camp is eight
miles from the Thai border town of Mae Sot.
   Some Karens, who reported the casualties, fled to Thailand to
escape the fighting. There were no reports of rebel casualties or
any independant verification of the number of troops killed.
   Karens are the largest of a dozen ethnic rebel groups that have
fought for greater autonomy from Rangoon for about 40 years.
   That automony was promised to them under Burma's Constitution,
after independence was won from Great Britain in 1948.
   Thai border police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Burmese troops crossed into Thailand this morning and attacked Thai
positions near the village of Mae Kong Khen, just south of Mae Sot.
A Thai soldier was seriously wounded in a firefight. Three Buddhist
monks were also reported hurt as more than 100 Burmese shells landed
inside Thai territory, police said.
   By evening, police said about 50 Burmese troops, who had been
attempting to attack Pa Loo from behind, remained inside Thailand at
Mae Kong Khen, pinned down between Thai and Karen lines and
prevented by both sides from moving.
   The Karen sources, who demanded anonymity, said they were
confident of withstanding the Burmese assault.
   Thai police said 2,000 Karen guerrillas and Burmese civilians
fled into Thialand on Saturday as government troops seized control
of areas near Pa Loo.
   Karen sources said 22 Burmese soldiers and six rebels were killed
in fighting around Pa Loo between June 1 and June 10. Another 31
government troops were wounded, as were 13 Karens, they said.
   Fighting has raged in parts of the Karen state bordering Thailand
since the Burmese army began an intensive campaign to crush the
insurgency in October.
   With larger forces and superior firepower, government forces have
overrun five major Karen camps since December. These setbacks have
severely disrupted the cross-border trade that finances the
insurgency.
   Recent Burmese battle successes have partly been attributed to
the Thai army allowing Burmese troops to enter Thailand and attack
Karen bases from behind, rebels contend. But Thailand last month
protested a large-scale incursion by between 400 and 600 Burmese
troops who burned a village marketplace during an attack on the
Karen camp at Kaw Moo Ra on May 20.
   Burma expressed regret over the incident but asked Thailand not
to permit insurgents to take refugee on the Thai side of the border.
   Thailand has strengthened trade links with Burma since the
military took power in Rangoon in September and is anxious to ensure
the smooth flow of official trade across the frontier.

<HEAD>Fly Boy Collecting Signatures on Scroll While Awaiting Repairs to
Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old hoping to become the youngest pilot
to fly around the world plans to use some down time today to collect
signatures from Massachusetts schoolchildren while awaiting repairs
to his single-engine plane.
   Tony Aliengena, the precocious aviator from Southern California
who gives new meaning to the term ``fly boy,'' has been gathering
signatures at every stop since he set out on the trip June 5. He
plans to present the 800-foot scroll of signatures to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev later this month.
   Tony and his family arrived in Lawrence on Saturday from
Washington, but the autopilot mechanism on his Cessna 210 Centurion
gave out during the flight.
   The result will be a short delay, giving Tony time to meet with
students from Frost Elementary School in Lawrence while repairs are
made, said his father, Gary Aliengena.
   ``We're about to leave the civilized world as we know it and head
north, so we need an autopilot,'' he said.
   The itinerary for the journey, dubbed Friendship Flight '89,
originally called for the pint-sized pilot to fly today to Canada,
then on to Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland before
entering Soviet air space June 23.
   The Aliengenas now expect to leave the United States on Tuesday
morning.
   The boy and two other pilots following him in small planes have
hit some rough weather since setting out from California a week
earlier. But they are most worried about the upcoming leg of the
trip, crossing the icy North Atlantic from Canada to Scandinavia.
   Gary Aliengena, a real estate investor and devoted pilot who
taught his son to fly while the boy sat on his lap, has enlarged the
plane's fuel tank to extend its range to 1,500 miles from 900. He
also made Tony go through a water survival course and is carrying
wet suits and flares in the aircraft.
   Tony has already collected more than 200,000 signatures on the
scroll. Some signers have appended short messages and drawings.
``Let's spend more time making friends than weapons,'' wrote a girl
in St. Louis.
   The boy is being accompanied by his parents; 10-year-old sister,
Alaina; two Soviet journalists; an independent filmmaker; an
observer from the National Aeronautic Association; a public
relations coordinator; and Tony's 11-year-old Russian pen pal, Roman
Tcheremnykh of Moscow.

   Authorities today banned the student and worker
groups that spearheaded the pro-democracy movement and stepped up
criticism of the United States for sheltering leading dissident Fang
Lizhi.
   The government on Sunday ordered the arrests of Fang and his
wife, Li Shuxian, an assistant professor at Beijing University, for
what authorities said were counterrevolutionary activities.
   The two prominent dissidents sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing after the June 4 military attack on students in Tiananmen
Square.
   In Washington, the Bush administration indicated it would not
turn the couple over to Chinese authorities. A U.S. official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, indicated that any attempt to
arrest Fang and Li would be resisted.
   As a result of the army's assault on unarmed protesters in the
square, U.S.-Chinese relations have plunged to perhaps the lowest
point since diplomatic ties were restored a decade ago.
   The government-controlled media today accused the Voice of
America, which reported hundreds of deaths in the city center a week
ago, of false reporting and distortion. Official media claim no one
was killed on the square.
   Authorities have launched a propaganda campaign aimed at
convincing the populace that soldiers were the victims of a
rampaging mob and that foreign reports of troops opening fire on
unarmed crowds are lies.
   Official media told people to study senior leader Deng Xiaoping's
speech Friday that praised the army for crushing the 7-week-old,
pro-democracy movement. Deng claimed the movement's leaders intended
to turn communist China into a capitalist republic.
   National television repeatedly showed scenes of one man,
identified as a leader of an independent labor union in Shanghai,
who had apparently been beaten and was being held at gunpoint by
police.
   His face was swollen so badly he could barely open his eyes.
   Broadcasts also showed the arrests of dozens of other people,
many described as ``thugs'' who took advantage of the movement to
commit crimes during protests that hit more than a dozen Chinese
cities.
   The propaganda assault and heavy troop presence in Beijing have
ended nationwide protests that broke out after the capital was
occupied by troops.
   The Ministry of Public Security announced in a notice read today
on Beijing Radio that: ``All illegal organizations which incite or
create social disturbances and counterrevolutionary rebellion are
banned.''
   It said those leaders who refuse to surrender ``will be arrested,
brought to justice and dealt with severely ...''
   Many student leaders appear to have gone underground.
   Authorities have arrested about 750 people, mainly workers and
unemployed youths, in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan, Lanzhou and
Guiyang. There have also been arrests in Xian, Canton, Changsha,
Zhengzhou and other cities.
   The attacks on the U.S. government-funded VOA intensified today
with the official Beijing Daily running an editorial that was read
on television.
   ``VOA really has created too many rumors,'' it said. ``They've
done enough to add fuel to the flames of the counterrevolutionary
turmoil.''
   The editorial continued: ``Beijing is returning to order and the
people are settling down. VOA also should take a rest.''
   The government also criticized the U.S. Embassy for harboring
Fang and Li.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Fang and his wife were
charged with ``committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda
and instigation'' in connection with the pro-democracy protests.
   The Foreign Ministry strongly protested the sheltering of Fang,
and official media have repeatedly demanded that the outspoken
critic of Marxism be turned over to authorities.
   China also has lashed out at the United States for banning
military sales in China in response to the June 4 assault. The
Chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed, mostly
soldiers. However, Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence said
the toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.
   The only comparable strain on U.S.-Chinese relations since formal
ties were re-established in 1979 has been the question of
Washington's ties with Taiwan, the Nationalist Chinese-ruled island
Beijing considers a renegade province.
   ABC quoted Chinese sources Sunday as saying police arrested Ren
Wanding, a leading dissident and accountant who had written essays
criticizing the Communist government.
   Like Fang, Ren did not play a leading role in the recent student
demonstrations but voiced support for their goals.
   The British Foreign Office today said it had asked China's
Foreign Ministry to look into the case of a Hong Kong student who
was arrested in Shanghai as he was about to board a flight to go
home to the British colony.
   Yao Yongzhan, 19, was in the company of several British students
and British consulate officials when he was detained at the airport.
   Shanghai authorities said Yao headed an independent Shanghai
student group. In Beijing, foreign reporters must have local
government approval to report from all areas under martial law,
meaning all of central Beijing.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's speech
Monday on his clean air proposals.
   Thank you all very much.
   Thank you.
   Thank you very much.
   Please, governors.
   Well, in this room are Republicans and Democrats, leaders from
both sides of the aisle in Congress, governors, executives from some
of the most important companies and business organizations in
America, leading conservationists, and people who have devoted their
lives to creating a cleaner and safer environment.
   And I've invited you here today to make a point: With the
leadership assembled in this room, we can break the stalemate that
has hindered progress on clean air for the past decade; and with the
minds, the energy, the talent assembled here, we can find a solution.
   So let me tell you the purposes of this morning's gathering.
   First, I'd like to lay on the table my proposals to curb acid
rain and cut urban smog and clean up air toxics.
   And second, I want to call upon all of you to join me in enacting
into law a new clean air act this year.
   But first, we should remember how far we've come and recognize
what works.
   The 1970 Clean Air Act got us moving in the right direction, with
national air quality standards that were strengthened by amendments
in 1977.
   Since 1970, even though we have 55 percent more cars going 50
percent farther, in spite of more utility output and more industrial
production, we still made progress.
   Lead concentrations in the air we breathe are down 98 percent;
sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, cut by over a third; particulate
matter, cut 21 percent; even ozone-causing emissions have been cut
by 17 percent.
   And still, over the last decade, we have not come far enough.
   Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air, and political
paralysis has plagued further progress against air pollution.
   We have to break this logjam by applying more than just federal
leverage.
   We must take advantage of the innovation, energy, and ingenuity
of every American.
   The environmental movement has a long history here in this
country.
   It's been a force for good, for a safer, healthier America.
   And as a people, we want and need that economic growth, but now
we must also expect environmental responsibility and respect the
natural world.
   And this will demand a national sense of commitment, a new ethic
of conservation, and I reject the notion that sound ecology and a
strong economy are mutually exclusive.
   So last week, I outlined five points of a new environmental
philosophy.
   One, to harness the power of the marketplace; two, to encourage
local initiative; three, to emphasize prevention instead of just
cleanup; four, to foster international cooperation; and five, to
ensure strict enforcement. Polluters will pay.
   We know more now than we did just a few years ago.
   New solutions are close at hand.

<HEAD>Vice President Presses Case for Noriega Departure</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 17 grafs new with report of meeting; picks up at pvs 10th
graf, Nonetheless, Quayle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

   Vice President Dan Quayle underscored U.S.
insistence that Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega step down
soon and urged Guatemalan leader to promote that goal, Bush
administration officials said today.
   Guatemalan government officials told Quayle in a meeting Sunday
night about a new Organization of American States plan to pressure
Noriega from power. But administration sources said U.S. officials
are worried that the military chief may try to hang on while a
national reconciliation effort in Panama is under way.
   Quayle met with Guatemalan Foreign Minister Mario Palencia on the
eve of Palencia's departure today for Panama as part of an OAS team
that is seeking to negotiate a solution to the Panamanian quagmire.
   Palencia told Quayle, ``There was a new plan, a new formula, that
was being applied, in the thus far unsuccessful effort to remove
Noriega,'' who has been indicted by U.S. grand juries on
drug-trafficking charges, said an official traveling with Quayle.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to
give specifics of that plan other than to say it would provide for
deposing Noriega and installing a democratically elected government.
   One official told reporters that Quayle was interested in the
proposal but was insistent on the U.S. position that Noriega must
step down at once and preferably leave Panama. That means Noriega
would not be allowed to remain while his country's politicians
engaged in reconciliation dialogue.
   Quayle reiterated that point this morning to a group of
Guatemalan political and community leaders, saying: ``Our bottom
line is that Noriega must leave, not only from power, but also it is
our position that he should leave the country.''
   The vice president also discussed with the Guatemalans further
steps that might be taken regarding Panama should the OAS effort
fail. Part of the purpose of his three-day, four-nation trip to
Central America is to sound out U.S. allies on initiatives they
might take to further the anti-Noriega effort.
   The possibility was discussed that Noriega might go to a country
that does not have extradition agreements with the United States and
thus avoid having to face drug indictment charges in Florida, one
official said.
   But he added that ``we don't have anything in writing'' from any
countries offering to take Noriega.
   In his meeting Sunday night, Quayle also asked Guatemala's
defense chief, Hector Alejandro Gramajo, to relay to Panamanian
military forces President Bush's position that it is Noriega the
United States opposes, not the Panamanian Defense Force he heads.
   Bush has urged the Panamanian military as well as the country's
citizens to rise up and oust Noriega.
   Quayle later met with Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo
   Flying here Sunday, Quayle told reporters aboard Air Force Two
that he will tell Contra field commanders that they should consider
dropping their fight against leftist-ruled Nicaragua and returning
home peacefully.
   ``We are clearly on a diplomatic and political course,'' with
regard to Nicaragua, he said. ``I will lay out the option to them
about the possibility of returning to Nicaragua,'' as envisioned in
Bush's $49 million package of non-lethal aid to the U.S.-backed
Contras.
   Bush and Congress agreed that the U.S. money can be used for
repatriation of the Contras while the presidents of the five Central
American countries negotiate toward free elections in Nicaragua next
February.
   Quayle was skeptical that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega will
fulfill his promise to hold fair elections.
   Nonetheless, Quayle said, he will talk with the Contras about the
possibility that they might want to return and take part in the
Nicaraguan political process. He meets the Contras on Tuesday in
Honduras.
   The 11,000-member Contra army is camped in Honduras near the
Nicaraguan border, but Quayle will meet with the commanders, and
possibly their military leader, Enrique Bermudez, in the capital of
Tegucigalpa.
   Quayle said his reservations about Ortega shouldn't be taken by
the Contras as a signal to hold on for the possibility of renewed
U.S. military aid.
   The Democratic-controlled Congress has blocked more military aid
and that isn't likely to change, he agreed.
   Speaking of the possibility of the Contras returning home, Quayle
said, ``I'm certainly going to lay that out as an option. And if
they feel comfortable, they should be encouraged to go back.''
   But he added, `I don't think it would be proper for me to say
this is your only option.''
   The vice president said Nicaragua's leadership doesn't appear to
be moving toward free elections.
   Of the Contra commanders, Quayle said, `I don't have to tell them
what Danny Ortega's track record is.''
   U.S. officials say they have evidence that Nicaragua is still
supplying weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador, in violation of
regional peace agreement signed by Ortega.
   Quayle said the focus of his trip, in addition to discussing the
Panama question, will be to spotlight regional democracy and to
``get involved on a substantive basis'' with the presidents before
they and Ortega meet again in July for more work on their peace plan.
   Regarding the latter mission, Quayle said he intended to discuss
U.S. objections to the all-powerful electoral commission formed by
the Sandinistas to oversee the elections. The administration claims
the membership is stacked in favor of the Sandinistas, putting
opposition candidates at a disadvantage.

<HEAD>University Researchers Wants Dirty Diapers From 40 Babies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have a deal new mothers can't
refuse: free disposable diapers _ in exchange for dirty ones.
   Honest, says Constance Kies, professor of human nutrition at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
   Her department is looking for about 40 pregnant women who will
deliver sometime this fall so they can immediately enroll their
babies and their diapers in the five-day program to analyze
nutrition.
   ``It's not invasive, we do not intrude upon the babies' lives at
all,'' Kies said. ``All we want are their dirty diapers.''
   The diapers and their contents will be used by graduate students
to study levels of manganese in bottle-fed and breast-fed babies and
potassium and sodium levels in diabetic and non-diabetic mothers and
in their infants.
   ``The analysis of the data is pretty straightforward,'' Kies
said. ``The obtaining of the subjects and the raw material is pretty
labor-intensive.''
   To get a proper sample, the students need about 10 dirty diapers
from each baby each day, at least 400 diapers per day or 2,000 dirty
diapers in all.
   ``I understand that new moms go through a tremendous amount of
diapers, so we figured they could use some free ones,'' Kies said.
   Collecting the diapers from homes is pretty simple, but
arrangements have to be made with the hospitals where the babies are
born to save the diapers as well.
   ``Normally they want to get rid of them as fast as they can,''
Kies said.

<HEAD>Arsonist Torches 22 Barns In Two Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMER, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers in McNairy County have taken to
camping in their barns to catch an arsonist who has set fire to 22
barns in two years.
   ``It's got everybody baffled,'' said Sheriff Robert Lee. ``It's
just hard to catch an arsonist. You've got no idea ... why they're
doing it.''
   Investigators say the arsonist strikes late Sunday or early
Monday and burns up to three barns at a time. The firebug doesn't
use an accelerant such as gasoline, just the materials at hand. The
last fire was May 22.
   All but one of the barns were destroyed.
   ``It looks like the person is trying to burn people out,'' said
Grady White, whose Stantonville barn burned in 1988. ``People try to
watch their barns as close as they can. But they're pretty smart
about it, whoever they are.''
   Authorities say they have some suspects, but no arrests have been
made despite hundreds of hours of investigation.
   The arsonist is believed to live in the rural county, about 80
miles from Memphis.
   The Forestry Department and the Farm Bureau are offering up to
$7,000 for information on the crimes, Robert Frost, assistant
commissioner of fire prevention for the Department of Commerce and
Insurance, said last week.
   Neighborhood watch groups have been formed over the last six
months, and some farmers camp out in their barns Sunday nights.
Investigators have also conducted stakeouts and set up roadblocks,
but no one has spotted the firebug.
   ``The only thing people can do is watch their own property,''
Fire Chief Jimmy Dickey said. ``A lot of them are talking about
neighborhood watch groups, and I said as long as you keep yourself
clear of it, it's OK.
   ``I just don't want to see anyone get hurt.''
   Racine Meek, who lost a tractor and other equipment in a blaze
near Adamsville, blames arson investigators for the lack of an
arrest.
   ``I don't have much confidence in the arson people here,'' Meek
said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
arrived today for his first state visit to West Germany and held
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl that reportedly focused on arms
reductions.
   Gorbachev met with Kohl for more than an hour at the chancellor's
office in talks that concerned President Bush's May 29 proposal to
cut conventional arms in Europe, West German television reported.
   A West German government spokesman, Manfred Oblaender, said the
initial round of talks was ``more substantial and intense'' than
expected, and that it had been extended. He would not elaborate.
   A wedge of motorcycle police led the Soviet leader's black
limousine to the chancellor's office, and Gorbachev waved from the
open car window to a crowd of 100 people, some of whom had stood in
the hot afternoon sun for nearly an hour.
   Friedbert Pflueger, a spokesman for West German President Richard
von Weizsaecker, said an earlier one-hour meeting between the
Weizsaecker and Gorbachev focused on political and private subjects.
   He said that Gorbachev also discussed the new NATO arms control
proposals with Weizsaecker, the titular West German head of state,
in preparation for a joint statement by the two governments. He did
not elaborate.
   The Soviet president came to strengthen ties between East and
West, an objective that goes to the heart of this divided nation.
   ``I arrived with the best feelings and with the wish to do
everything so that our relationship and cooperation can develop
further,'' Gorbachev said in a brief exchange with television
reporters at the state residence, Villa Hammerschmidt.
   ``I'm using the opportunity of this first interview to wish the
citizens of the federal republic health and well-being,'' he told
West Germany's ZDF TV.
   Much of Gorbachev's visit was being broadcast live.
   The Soviet president and his wife, Raisa, emerged from their
Aeroflot Ilyushin-62 jet at Cologne-Bonn airport this morning and
stood somberly for a 21-gun salute before descending to the tarmac
for a hearty greeting from Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   The Kremlin motorcade of four ZILs made a detour to the Soviet
Embassy before proceeding under a helicopter security escort to the
Villa Hammerschmidt for a sun-splashed welcome by Weizsaecker and
Kohl.
   During his current four-day visit to West Germany, Gorbachev
leaves behind rioting in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan
and two weeks of sharp debate in the new Congress over political
power and economic failures.
   His talks with West German officials will give him a chance to
concentrate on foreign policy, his area of greatest success in four
years in power, and the technology and financial help needed to
modernize the Soviet economy.
   Gorbachev's agenda includes meetings with scientific and business
leaders and factory tours.
   Gorbachev says Germany is at the center of what he calls ``our
common European home.'' Public opinion polls in West Germany have
found him to be the most popular foreign leader ever.
   Soviet officials, speaking at a briefing Sunday in Bonn, said
that the Western allies need not fear that Gorbachev might try to
woo West Germany to unite with Communist East Germany in a neutral
entity.
   Georgy A. Arbatov, head of the Kremlin's U.S.A.-Canada Institute,
said the division of Europe is unnatural but ``it's up to Germany to
decide its political status.
   ``We're not exerting any behind-the-scenes pressure.''
   He said the Soviet Union, instead of imposing solutions on its
Eastern Euopean allies, is committed to accept reforms in countries
such as Poland and Hungary to solve problems that have been
festering for years.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov was asked
about European fears of German-Soviet cooperation similar to the
Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact signed just before the Nazis
started World War II.
   He replied, ``Three things have changed since 1940. First, the
Soviet Union has changed. Second, Germany has changed. Third, the
world has changed. How can you make comparisons?''
   West Germany is NATO's front-line state facing the Warsaw Pact
alliance and Kohl has pressed the Western allies to accept
Gorbachev's proposal for immediate talks to eliminate short-range
nuclear missiles. Most of the weapons are on German soil.
   The United States and Britain disagreed with Kohl but a compomise
was reached at last month's NATO summit in Brussels. The alliance
agreed to a proposal by Bush to couple negotiations on short-range
missiles with progress on reduction of conventional forces.
   Gorbachev offered in May to withdraw 500 Soviet nuclear weapons,
but Soviet officials said it was unlikely he would come to Bonn with
a response to the Bush proposal.
   ``For about five months the Bush administration wouldn't answer
our proposals,'' Arbatov said. ``Then they make a proposal and
expect an answer right away.''

   It's time to put our best minds to work to turn technology and
the power of the marketplace to the advantage of the environment: to
create, to innovate, to tip the scales in favor of recovery,
restoration, and renewal.
   Every American expects and deserves to breathe clean air, and as
president, it is my mission to guarantee it for this generation and
for the generations to come.
   If we take this commitment seriously, if we believe that every
American expects and deserves clean air, and then we act on that
belief, then we will set an example for the rest of the world to
follow.
   Today, I am proposing to Congress a new clean air act, and
offering a new opportunity.
   We've seen enough of this stalemate.
   It's time to clear the air _ and you know, I think we will.
   We touched a lot of bases as we prepared this bill, and we've had
the benefit of some good thinking on the hill, and we've met with
business leaders who see environmental protection as essential to
long-term economic growth, and we've talked with environmentalists
who know that cost-effective solutions help build public support for
conservation.
   And we've worked with academics and innovative thinkers from
every quarter who have laid the groundwork for this approach.
   And just this morning, I spoke by phone with Prime Minister
Mulroney of Canada.
   I believe he's excited about the prospect, too.
   I have no pride of authorship _ let me commend Project '88 and
groups like the Environmental Defense Fund for bringing creative
solutions to longstanding problems; for not only breaking the mold,
but helping to build a new one.
   And we've had to make some tough choices.
   And some may think we've gone too far, and others not far enough,
but we all care about clean air.
   To the millions of Americans who still breathe unhealthy air, let
me tell you, I'm concerned _ I'm concerned about vulnerable groups
like the elderly and asthmatics and children; concerned about every
American's quality of life.
   And I'm committed to see that coming generations receive the
natural legacy they deserve.
   We seek reforms that make major pollution reductions where we
most need them.
   First, our approach is reasonable deadlines for those who must
comply.
   It has compelling sanctions for those who don't.
   It accounts for continued economic growth and expansion, offers
incentives, choice, and flexibility for industry to find the best
solutions, and taps the power of the marketplace and local
initiative better than any previous piece of environmental
legislation.
   This legislation will be comprehensive.
   It will be cost-effective.
   But, above all, it will work.
   We will make the 1990s the era for clean air.
   And we have three clear goals and three clear deadlines.
   First, we will cut the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid
rain by almost half, by 10 million tons.
   And we will cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 2 million tons.
   Both by the year 2000.
   We have set absolute goals for reductions and have emphasized
early gains.
   And that means 5 million tons will be cut by 1995 and the
degradation caused by acid rain will stop by the end of this century.
   To make sure that coal continues to play a vital role in our
energy future, we've provided an extension of three years and
regulatory incentives for the use of innovative clean coal
technology.
   We've set an ambition _ an ambitious reduction target and
applying market forces will be the fastest, most cost-effective way
to achieve it.
   So we're allowing utilities to take _ to trade credits among
themselves for reductions they make to let them decide how to bring
aggregrate emissions down as cost effectively as possible.

<HEAD>Court Bolsters Judges' Power to Impose Harhser Penalties on Some
Defendants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today bolstered the power of
judges to impose harsher penalties on criminal defendants who back
out of plea-bargained agreements that called for lighter sentences.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, apparently reinstated the life
sentence of an Alabama man convicted of burglary.
   Before standing trial in 1986, James Lewis Smith had pleaded
guilty to the burglary charge and had been sentenced to 30 years in
prison for it.
   Smith was indicted in Montgomery, Ala., on charges of rape,
burglary and sodomy _ all arising from the same incident.
   In a plea-bargain agreement, he pleaded guilty to rape and
burglary and the sodomy charge was dropped. Smith was sentenced to
30 years on each conviction, with the sentences to run concurrently.
   He then sought to withdraw his guilty plea, and a state appeals
court allowed him to do so. It ruled that Smith had not been
informed that he would be sentenced as a repeat offender, and would
be subject to stiffer penalties than he expected.
   Smith then stood trial and was convicted of all three crimes. The
same state judge who had accepted his guilty plea sentenced Smith to
separate life terms for sodomy and burglary, but set aside the
sentence for Smith's rape conviction.
   The Alabama Supreme Court last year threw out Smith's life
sentence on the burglary conviction, ruling that it represented
judicial vindictiveness.
   The state court's ruling, however, did not affect Smith's life
sentence for the sodomy conviction.
   Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman then asked the nation's
highest court to draw a distinction between cases in which
defendants withdraw guilty pleas and those in which they are
resentenced after successfully appealing convictions or sentences.
   In a pair of 1969 decisions, the court limited judges' power to
impose more stringent sentences for defendants in both circumstances.
   But today's decision reversed one of the 1969 rulings to create
the distinction Siegelman had sought.
   ``There is no basis for a presumption of vindictiveness where a
second sentence imposed after a trial is heavier than a first
sentence imposed after a guilty plea,'' Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote for the court.
   He said Smith is free to pursue with the Alabama Supreme Court
his contention that there is evidence to support a finding of actual
vindictiveness by the sentencing judge in his case.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall was the sole dissenter.
   The case is Alabama vs. Smith, 88-333.

<HEAD>Japan's Foreign Aid Up 22.5 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's total foreign aid rose 22.5 percent to $9.13
billion in 1988, making it the world's second-largest donor after
the United States, the Foreign Ministry said Monday.
   U.S. foreign aid totaled about $9.8 billion last year, the
ministry said.
   Much of the growth in Japan's development assistance in dollar
terms came from the Japanese yen's greater strength in foreign
exchange markets. In yen terms, the $9.13 billion spent on foreign
aid was an 8.6 percent increase over the $7.45 billion spent in 1987.
   The ministry calculated dollar figures using the government's
official average exchange rate for 1988 of 128.15 yen to the dollar,
down from 144.64 yen in 1987.
   Japan's direct aid _ not channeled through international agencies
_ accounted for 70.3 percent of the total, or $6.42 billion, the
ministry said.
   Of total direct aid, about $3.51 billion, or 55 percent, was in
loans, an increase of about 30.9 percent from 1987. The remaining 45
percent _ $2.91 billion _ was in grants, up 16.1 percent.
   Japan's $10 billion foreign aid budget for fiscal 1989 would make
it the world's largest donor nation, assuming the yen doesn't weaken
significantly.

<HEAD>Court Says California Sales Tax May be Levied in Liquidations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case involving ski
equipment rentals, ruled today that state taxes may be imposed when
bankrupt companies sell their assets.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said the taxes may be imposed on such
sales and on a buyer's subsequent use of the assets when bankrupt
companies are ordered to liquidate.
   The court allowed California officials to tax the rental of skis
by a ski resort that acquired the equipment from a bankrupt company.
   Nothing in the Constitution or federal law forbids such state
taxes, said Justice John Paul Stevens for the court.
   He said a doctrine that bars states from imposing taxes on the
federal government does not extend to private companies in
bankruptcy proceedings. Such proceedings are overseen by federal
judges who appoint officials to dispose of the assets.
   States may tax private parties with whom the federal government
does business even if a financial burden falls on the government,
Stevens said.
   ``Whatever immunity the bankrupt estate once enjoyed from
taxation on its operations has long since eroded and there is now no
constitutional impediment to the imposition of a sales tax or use
tax on a liquidation sale,'' he said.
   Dissenting were Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan
and Thurgood Marshall.
   The ruling is a defeat for Sierra Summit and the ski resort's
parent corporation, Snow Summit Ski Corp.
   The corporation acquired the assets of China Peak Resort for $3.5
million after China Peak declared bankruptcy in 1981. The assets
included skis to be used for renting to customers.
   The California State Board of Equalization sought to assess
$55,000 in taxes on the sale of the assets. But a federal bankruptcy
judge in 1983 barred the tax on grounds the assets transferred from
a bankrupt company are exempt.
   The state board took another approach in 1985, seeing to impose a
use tax on income of $196,518 that Sierra Summit received from
renting the skis acquired from China Peak.
   Under California law, if Sierra Summit had paid either sales or
use tax on its purchase of the skis, the rental income would not be
taxable.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals barred the taxes.
   The case is California vs. Sierra Summit, 88-681.

   Battle Creek has lost its bid to
regain the World's Largest Breakfast Table title. But not for lack
of appetite.
   ``It was the weather,'' said Rick Royal, co-chairman of Battle
Creek's weeklong Cereal Festival. ``It was predicted to be sunny and
mild, but it just wasn't there for us in the early morning hours. It
was just very cold.''
   A breakfast including cold cereal and doughnut holes was served
Saturday to 32,856 people, who huddled over their food in cloudy,
50-degree temperatures as whipping winds lifted place mats and milk
cartons.
   The number of people fed in 3{ hours at the 2,000-foot table
missed the mark of 33,869 set by Springfield, Mass., at a May 13
pancake breakfast.
   Mayor Albert Bobrofsky will send a gift of cereal to Springfield
Mayor Mary Hurley.
   Battle Creek is home to Kellogg Co., the Post division of General
Foods Corp. and Ralston Purina Co., all makers of cereal.
   Battle Creek held the first free cereal breakfast in 1956 to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of Kellogg's founding. The first
taste of competition was in 1977, when Springfield fed 11,000
people, wresting away the title.
   It's been heated competition ever since.
   Last year, Battle Creek fed 32,697 people to beat Springfield.
Last month, Springfield reclaimed the record.
   ``Even though they are the breakfast capital of the world for the
year, we still lay claim to Cereal City,'' Royal said.

   A 10-year-old with a yen for fishing but
no one to teach him has taken out a newspaper ad for a surrogate
grandpa.
   ``I've been wanting to go fishing for a long time and my parents
don't really have time to take me a lot,'' said Brandon Weber.
``That's when my mom and I decided to get a buddy for me.''
   The requirements are simple enough, he said: ``somebody who's had
some experience, that's a good fisherman and knows a lot of stuff.''
   So for three days Brandon's parents, Judy and Ernie Weber, ran
this ad in the Bureau County Republican:
   ``WANTED: Surrogate grandpa. Goal: Fishing buddy for a
10-year-old.''
   The Webers hadn't had a response by Friday, and telephone calls
Monday went unanswered.
   ``Brandon would come in and say, `Did a grandpa call?' I'd say,
`No, not yet,''' said Mrs. Weber.
   Mrs. Weber, a nurse, and her husband have full-time jobs and
little interest in the outdoors. Besides, she said, ``It's not the
same with a mom as it is with a grandpa who stands there helping
you, telling the stories.''
   Both of Brandon's grandfathers are dead.

   Cleaner fuels, better technologies, energy conservation, improved
efficiency in any combination _ just as long as it works.
   There's a wisdom to handing work to those most qualified to do it.
   Four hundred years ago, Montaigne wrote: ``Let us permit nature
to have her way. She understands her business better than we do.''
   Well, it's true.
   Acid rain must be stopped, and that's what we all care about.
   But it's also true that business understands its business better
than we do.
   So we're going to put that understanding to work on behalf of
clean air and a sound environment.
   We've provided the goals, but we won't try to micromanage them.
   We will allow flexibility in how industry achieves these goals;
but we stand firm on what must be achieved.
   Second, this federal proposal will cut the emissions that cause
urban ozone _ smog _ virtually in half.
   This will put the states well on the road to meeting the standard.
   Twenty years ago, 20 years ago we started on the job, and if
Congress will act on the clean air reforms that I'm offering today,
20 years from now every American in every city in America will
breathe clean air.
   Today, 81 cities don't meet federal air quality standards.
   This legislation will bring clean air to all but about 20 cities
by 1995, and within 20 years, even Los Angeles and Houston and New
York will be expected to make it.
   In the nine urban areas with the greatest smog problem, we
propose bold new initiatives to reconcile the automobile to the
environment, ensuring continued economic growth without disruptive
driving controls.
   We'll accomplish this through alternative fuels and clean-fueled
vehicles.
   We propose to put up to a million clean-fueled vehicles a year on
the road by 1997.
   But we're also proposing flexibility on the means, even as we
remain firm on the goals.
   A city can either request inclusion in a program or, if they show
they can achieve these ambitious reductions through other measures,
we will scale back the clean-fuel vehicle requirements accordingly.
   Also, we're sensitive to the problems of smaller cities whose
ozone problems are due largely to pollutants that are generated in
other _ other areas, other regions, other cities.
   They will not be penalized for pollution problems outside their
control.
   Our program incorporates a mix of cost-effective measures to cut
emissions from cars, fuels, factories and other sources.
   But I am asking the EPA to develop rules like those we are
employing on acid rain to allow auto and fuel companies to trade
required reductions in order to meet this standard in the most
cost-effective way.
   Our challenge is to develop an emissions trading plan.
   Their challenge is to meet the standards.
   The third leg of our proposal is designed to cut all categories
of airborne toxic chemicals by three-quarters within this decade.
   Our best minds will apply the most advanced industrial technology
available to control these airborne poisons.
   The very best control technology we have will determine the
standard we set for those plans.
   And until now, because of an unworkable law, the EPA has been
able to regulate only seven of the 280 known air toxics.
   The bill I'm proposing today will set a schedule for regulating
sources of air toxics by dates certain.
   In addition, it will give the dedicated people of the EPA the
right tools for the job, and it will make state-of-the-art
technology an every day fact of doing business and that's the way it
should be.
   In its first phase, this initiative should eliminate about
three-quarters of the needless deaths from cancer that have been
caused by toxic industrial air emissions, and we plan a second phase
to go after any remaining unreasonable risk.
   People who live near industrial facilities should not have to
fear for their health.
   And for 10 years, we have struggled to engage a united effort on
behalf of clean air, and we are now on the edge of real change.
   1989 could be recorded as the year when business leaders and
environmental advocates began to work together, when environmental
issues moved out of the courts, beyond conflict, into a new era of
cooperation.
   And this can be known as the year we mobilized leadership, both
public and private, to make environmental protection a growth
industry and keep our ecology safe for diversity.
   The wounded winds of north, south, east and west can be purified
and cleansed, and the integrity of nature can be made whole again.
   Ours is a rare opportunity to reverse the errors of this
generation in the service of the next.
   And we cannot, we must not fail.
   We must prevail.
   I ask for your support.
   We need your support to make all of this into a reality.
   Thank you all and God bless you and thank you very much for
coming.
   Thank you all.

   Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi again is at the center
of a dispute between the United States and China, hiding inside the
U.S. Embassy as infuriated communist officials demand his arrest.
   As China's most prominent dissident, Fang has been an unwitting
irritant in bilateral relations.
   In February, police prevented him from attending a party given by
President Bush for Chinese officials.
   The Chinese government said it resented the U.S. invitation to
Fang, who has openly criticized Marxism as a failure and says the
economic reforms of senior leader Deng Xiaoping won't succeed
without guarantees of basic rights, such as freedom of speech.
   Fang is receiving protection in the U.S. Embassy as China's
conservative leaders seek to suppress all dissent from advocates of
democratic reform.
   Chinese authorities issued an arrest warrant Saturday for Fang,
charging him with ``committing crimes of counterrevolutionary
propaganda and instigation.''
   The man who is the target of the official ire is a Beijing
Observatory professor with an easy manner and impish smile. His
conversation is punctuated by hearty laughs and an occasional knee
slap of delight.
   Fang, 53, says he is happiest pondering the mysteries of the
universe and has a poster of Albert Einstein hanging on the wall of
his flat near Beijing University.
   But he is best known for his fearless advocacy of transforming
the one-party communist state into a freer society. He was one of
only a few Chinese who dared to campaign publicly for democratic
change before the popular uprising for freedom rocked Beijing this
spring.
   ``I like to speak freely,'' Fang said in an interview last year.
``I think I just show ... we have the right of speech.''
   Fang not only spoke with sympathetic students and foreign
reporters but also tried to reach a broader, tougher audience of
Chinese.
   ``Some people think China doesn't need democracy, but I think
human rights are basic,'' Fang told actors, scientists and
businessmen at a holiday tea party in February. ``For (human rights)
to be realized, first of all famous people must take a stand,'' he
lectured.
   Fang burst into prominence during the pro-democracy student
demonstrations of 1986-87. Authorities alleged his speeches to
students at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei in
central China, where he was vice president, helped incite the
protests.
   China's leaders kicked him out of the Communist Party and fired
him from his university post. Although the demonstrations died down,
Fang refused to be silenced and he received letters of support from
across the country almost daily.
   Fang long has acknowledged his remarks could land him in jail.
Although he kept a low profile during recent pro-democracy
demonstrations so he could not be blamed for inciting them, he was
burned in effigy at a government rally two weeks ago.
   ``I'm a soldier who already crossed the river,'' he said last
year. ``There's no way to turn back.''
   Fang was born to the family of a postal clerk in Hangzhou and was
admitted to Beijing University in 1952, at age 16, to study
theoretical physics and nuclear physics.
   After studying nuclear reactor theory, he became one of China's
pioneer researchers in laser theory. His research in cosmology _ the
study of the universe _ and black hole physics won him international
attention.
   Fang said his break with Marxism began over cosmology.
   According to Fang, former Politburo member Hu Qiaomu had
questioned the need to study cosmology since Marxism already
maintained the universe was infinite.
   ``This is an open question right now,'' Fang said. ``In
cosmology, Marxism is not right.''

<HEAD>Superpower Accord Reduces Chance Of Military Conflicts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union today signed
an agreement to prevent military incidents such as accidental
intrusions by enemy warplanes from causing major conflicts between
the superpowers.
   The accord was signed at a Defense Ministry ceremony by the
Soviet armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, and
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of
staff.
   Crowe today began an official 11-day visit to the Soviet Union.
   The 19-page accord came after nine months of negotiations between
top U.S. and Soviet officials. It goes into effect Jan. 1.
   The agreement, intentionally limited in scope, does not touch
upon some areas where military incidents have occurred, such as the
shooting death of a U.S. Army major in East Germany in 1985 and the
bumping of two U.S. Navy ships by Soviet vessels in the Black Sea
last year. It also does not touch upon incidents involving civilian
aircraft.
   The accord does cover the accidental straying of military units
into the other country's territory and the hazardous use of
laser-range finders.
   It also covers hampering military operations in a tense area,
such as the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War, and interfering
with command and communications networks.
   The agreement spells out radio frequencies and code phrases for
contacting military aircraft, ships, or ground units that stray into
foreign territory, according to U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. George L.
Butler. He led the U.S. negotiating team for the agreement.

<HEAD>Court Says Magistrates Can't Preside Over Federal Jury Selection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal magistrates are not legally authorized
to preside over jury selection even when delegated such duty by
federal trial judges, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
   The justices threw out the federal convictions in New York City
of two men accused of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute
it.
   In an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, the court said the
convictions of Jose Gomez and Diego Chavez-Tesina were tainted
because the judge who presided over their trial assigned the task of
presiding over jury selection to a federal magistrate.
   Stevens said a 1968 law allowing federal judges to delegate some
duties to magistrates never was intended to include presiding over
jury selection in trials involving serious crimes, or felonies.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the two
convictions, for which Gomez had been sentenced to 10 years in
prison and 10 years' special parole and Chavez-Tesina to 20 years in
prison and lifetime special parole.
   According to court documents, Gomez has been an inmate at a
federal prison in Ashland, Ky., and Chavez-Tesina is imprisoned in
Milan, Mich.
   Today's decision means both men are entitled to new trials.
   The justices rejected Bush administration arguments that even if
a magistrate should not have presided over the jury-selection part
of the two men's trial, that fact amounted to ``harmless error.''
   ``Among those basic fair-trial rights that can never be treated
as harmless is a defendant's right to an impartial adjudicator, be
it judge or jury,'' Stevens wrote. ``Equally basic is a defendant's
right to have all critical stages of a criminal trial conducted by a
person with jurisdiction to preside.''
   The cases are Gomez vs. U.S., 88-5014; and Chavez-Tesina vs.
U.S., 88-5158.

   Cybill Shepherd says it's her duty to be an
outspoken feminist.
   ``I've read that some younger women don't see the need to
identify themselves as a feminist,'' the actress said in the July
issue of Glamour. ``Personally, I feel I owe something to the women
who came before me, who sacrificed to get us where we are today.''
   Ms. Shepherd said she became a feminist in 1970 but wasn't active
until four years ago, when she joined Gloria Steinem's group Voters
for Choice. Her first demonstration was an abortion-rights rally in
Washington in April.
   ``My belief that abortion is a constitutional right has gotten
even stronger, particularly because I have daughters,'' said Ms.
Shepherd.
   She has two daughters, 9-year-old Clementine Ford and 1{-year-old
Ariel Shepherd-Oppenheim, as well as Ariel's twin brother, Zack.
   ``Whenever you go out and march about an issue like this, you
take a risk. You're exposed. Some fanatic might shoot you,'' she
said.
   ``But in my heart, I realized that I would be willing to die for
this issue, to prevent the deaths that would result if abortion were
made illegal again.''

   Folk singer and activist Joan Baez invited
a banned singer on stage during a concert in Czechoslovakia this
weekend, but the microphones went dead as he began his song, an
activist news agency said.
   Baez was charged with breach of contract by concert organizers
after her performance, during which she also dedicated songs to an
imprisoned political activist and to independent Czech groups, the
report said Sunday.
   The report was issued by the independent East European news
agency VIA, run by activists in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and
the Soviet Union.
   Before her performance as part of an officially sponsored folk
festival in the Slovak capital of Bratislava, Baez met with nine
Czech activists, including banned playwright Vaclav Havel, who was
released last month midway through an eight-month jail sentence that
drew unprecedented protest at home and abroad.
   When Baez invited singer Ivan Hoffman, who is banned from
performing in Bratislava, on stage, the microphones were turned off,
the report said.
   The microphones were again switched off when Baez invited other
Czech performers on stage to sing the folk song ``Donna, Donna,''
but the audience of 2,500 people joined in the song, VIA said.

   President Bush today unveiled a sweeping
legislative proposal to cut acid rain pollutants and curb smog
plaguing the nation's cities, declaring ``too many Americans
continue to breathe dirty air.''
   The president's proposal, aimed at breaking a decade-long
congressinal stalemate that has blocked enactment of tougher federal
clean air laws, calls for a 50 percent, 10-million-ton reduction in
sulfur dioxide emissions, a chief cause of acid rain, from
coal-burning power plants.
   Other measures include a phase-in of cars powered by methanol,
aimed at curbing ozone-causing emissions from motor vehicles, and a
requirement for industry to use new technology to curb the release
of cancer-causing and other toxic chemicals.
   In a White House speech, Bush said that while some progress has
been made in cutting air pollution, ``over the last decade we have
not come far enough.''
   ``Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air _ and
political paralysis has plagued further progress against air
pollution ... Every American expects and deserves to breathe clean
air,'' he said.
   Bush said the new requirements call for ``tough choices'' to be
made by Congress and industry.
   But he said action was required because of the ``millions of
American who still breathe unhealthy air'' and the danger this poses
to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, asthmatics and children.
   The president received a standing ovation after his speech from
the more than 300 people crowded into the East Room. The invited
audience included governors, leaders of Congress, environmentalists
and industry representatives.
   Brooks B. Yeager, vice president for government relations of the
National Audubon Society, said, ``We may quarrel with some of the
details, but it's certainly a major step forward.''
   Yeager and other environmentalists praised Bush's blueprint for
stopping acid rain but said he was not going far enough to control
toxic poisons and other pollutants that are severe public health
threats.
   David Gardiner, legislative director for the Sierra Club, said,
``The president has laid out a bunch of very good objectives. It
will help break the logjam in Congress.''
   Earlier at a news briefing, William K. Reilly, administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency, called the clean air plan
``very ambitious and expensive'' but vitally needed.
   Reilly estimated the program's cost at between $14 billion and
$19 billion a year once it is in full effect at the turn of the
century.
   Among the actions, the president called on Congress to require
automakers to phase in cars that use alternate fuels such as
methanol with a goal of having 500,000 such vehicles in operation
within six years and 1 million such cars produced annually after
1996.
   Unlike gasolone, methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes the
severe smog problems that have made the air unhealthy in nearly 100
metropolitan areas.
   Reilly said Bush's proposals would bring most American cities
within federal air quality standards by 1995 and all but the most
severe problem areas _ Los Angeles, Houston and New York City _
within the guidelines by the year 2000.
   The proposed legislation also calls for tightening tailpipe
emissions from automobiles by 40 percent, and curbing other
automobile fuel-related pollutants.
   In an attempt to curb the release of toxic chemicals from
industrial plants, Bush proposed requiring industry to use the
``best available'' technology to curb such pollution. The plan
anticipates ``near term'' reductions in airborne toxic chemicals,
including many that are cancer causing, of between 75 and 90 percent.
   The proposals are part of a clean air package the president plans
to send to Congress in the coming weeks. Environmental legislation,
some of it calling for stronger actions than proposed by the
president, already has been introduced on Capitol Hill.
   Congressional leaders said they expect a revision of the 1970
Clean Air Act, which was last changed in 1977, to be enacted in this
Congress, probably early next year.
   The proposal to combat acid rain calls for half of the
10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide to be achieved by 1995.
The proposal would allow utilities that exceed the required
reductions to accumulate credits that would be sold or traded to
other utilities that are unable to reach the reduction targets.
   About 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide gas are released annually
into the air, most from power plants that burn high-sulphur coal.
The gas turns into sulfates, combines with moisture and falls as
rain or snow often hundreds of miles away.
   Scientists have blamed acid rain for causing substantial damage
to lakes, forests and acquatic life, especially in the Northeast and
Canada as a result of pollutants released from power plants in the
Ohio Valley and industrial Midwest.
   Bush's clean air package has been widely viewed as the first test
of whether his administration plans to act decisively on
environmental issues.
   Governors active in the bipartisan Alliance for Acid Rain Control
said in a television interview before the announcement that they
were encouraged by Bush's plan.
   ``There is no question it's going to be enforced,'' Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy Thompson said on ``CBS This Morning.'' ``... It's a giant
step forward for cleaning up the air and the atmosphere and our
lakes, especially in states like Wisconsin and Minnesota.''
   The president promised in his campaign last year and repeatedly
since taking office that he will move to tighten the federal clean
air laws, especially by taking action to curb acid rain.
   Last week Bush told a conservation group the clean air package he
intends to send Congress would represent ``sweeping changes'' in the
1970 Clean Air Act and ``significantly improve every North
American's quality of life'' whether they live near industrial
plants or in the countryside.
   The final package was approved by Bush over the weekend at Camp
David where the president reviewed an array of option papers
prepared by his Domestic Policy Council, which had debated
provisions of the package for weeks.
   Urban smog, largely caused by automobile pollutants, has been one
of the most difficult issues facing the administration. Advisers
were split over whether to require specific curbs to reduce
ozone-causing pollutants or allow automakers and the petroleum
industry to decide how best to meet government targets.
   Legislation already has been introduced in the House to require
stringent reductions in ozone-causing pollutants, cuts in acid rain
pollutants from coal-burning power plants and curbs in the release
of toxic chemicals from industrial plants.
   Some of the legislation already before Congress is tougher than
that envisioned by Bush's advisers.
   Environmentalists, for example, have sought a reduction in sulfur
dioxide from power plants of at least 12 million tons over the next
decade and have argued for tougher automobile emission controls.

   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani of
Iran, whose political position has strengthened since Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's death, was re-elected today to another one-year
term, Iran's news agency said.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said that 230 out of 241 deputies attending a special session of the
Majlis, the Iranian parliament, voted for Rafsanjani.
   One deputy voted against and there were 10 abstentions, IRNA said.
   Rafsanjani, 55, who also is the armed forces commander-in-chief,
has served as speaker for the past eight years.
   His armed forces post was reconfirmed last week by President Ali
Khamenei, who was selected to succeed Khomeini as Iran's leader.
   Khomeini died June 3 of a heart attack suffered 11 days after he
underwent surgery to stop intestinal bleeding.
   Rafsanjani, a political ally of Khamenei, is the only declared
candidate in the Aug. 18 presidential election. Under the
constitution, Khamenei cannot run for a third four-year term.
   Constitutional reforms expected to give the president increased
executive power at the expense of the prime minister's post are to
be approved in a referendum being held on the same day as the
presidential election.
   The reforms are intended to end disputes among competing power
centers in the hierarchy and speed up the decision-making process.
   Rafsanjani is considered the leader of a faction that favors
restoring ties with the West and boosting private enterprise in
order to rebuild the country's economy after the eight-year war with
Iraq.
   That faction is locked in a dispute with hardliners in the
regime, among them Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, who want to
maintain Iran's self-imposed isolation and advocate self-reliance.
   Before his death, Khomeini reinforced the radicals by calling for
a revival of revolutionary fervor and the assassination of British
author Salman Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rafsanjani thanked the Assembly of Experts, a body of
parliamentarians and theologians, for their swift selection of a new
leader the day after Khomeini's death. ``The people welcomed this
right choice and the enemies mourntheir empty dreams shattered,'' he
said, referring to predictions that Iran would be plunged into
political turmoil immediately after Khomeini died.
   He also called on parliament to work toward achieving Khomeini's
aims.
   ``As in the past, the Majlis must follow the leadership and,
while serving the people, carry out the principles of Islam,''
Rafsanjani said.

   A judge today found an obstetrician guilty of
infanticide on grounds that a fetus taken during an abortion on a
13-year-old was alive instead of stillborn as the doctor claimed.
   Dr. Joseph Melnick, 66, originally was accused of murder but that
charge was dismissed and replaced with the infanticide charge
allowed under the state's abortion law.
   The doctor could be sentenced to a prison term of 3{ to 7 years.
   Melnick's attorney, Richard Sprague, said immediately after the
verdict that he would appeal the case ``all the way until we get a
vindication.'' He suggested his client was the victim of the
``frustration raised over the abortion issue'' and not the evidence.
   ``I submit the evidence showed Dr. Melnick was innocent,'' he
said.
   Assistant District Attorney Andrea Foulkes, who prosecuted the
case, said it was the first criminal prosecution under the
Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act, which requires that a physician
performing an abortion must attempt to keep the fetus alive if
possible. She also said she knows of no other similar case, based on
a charge of infanticide, anywhere in the nation.
   Common Pleas Judge Lynne Abraham heard closing arguments last
week and announced her verdict this morning after spending the
weekend reviewing some 6,000 pages of testimony compiled in the
13-week trial.
   ``I find you guilty as charged of the crime of infanticide,''
said the judge without any additional explanation of her verdict.
   She set a Sept. 19 court date on the motion she expects from
Sprague for a new trial, the first step in the appeal process.
   Ms. Abraham's only comments on the case itself came last Friday
after Sprague said in his closing arguments that the evidence was
conclusive that Melnick considered the baby stillborn after the
abortion on Sept. 12, 1984.
   ``This case is one of unusual duration and complexity,'' the
judge said then.
   Melnick claimed he was told his patient was in her fourth month
of pregnancy when she was actually in the eighth month. He testified
the baby was stillborn.
   Other members of the West Park Hospital medical staff, where the
abortion was performed, said they detected a heartbeat and claimed
they saw the baby move and gasp. But other witnesses, however,
agreed with Melnick's diagnosis that the infant was stillborn.
   ``If Dr. Melnick thought this child were alive, what motivation
would he have not to do something?'' Sprague said.
   Disagreeing, Foulkes said in her closing argument that Melnick
was faced with a viable child, not a dead fetus, and ``stalled and
stalled and stalled (and) didn't act until the baby stopped moving.''
   Today, the prosecutor reacted to the verdict by saying, ``I am
very, very gratified.''

<HEAD>Conference to Consider How to Cope With Growing Number of Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The task of a U.N. conference beginning Tuesday is
to find ways of handling a dramatic increase in the number of
refugees who flee Vietnam in small boats and land in other southeast
Asian countries.
   The two-day meeting of 50 nations is aimed at ``relieving the
growing frustration of both countries of first asylum and
resettlement countries,'' said the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   Fourteen years after the Vietnam War ended, more than 1.2 million
Vietnamese have been resettled, the majority in the United States.
Most of the resettlement occurred after a 1979 Geneva conference on
their plight.
   Since 1986, resettlement has lagged behind the rate at which
refugees continue to flee Vietnam undeterred by the dangers, which
include attacks by pirates who rape and murder.
   Many Western resettlement countries, also confronted with growing
numbers of would-be immigrants from other regions, have reduced the
number of people they will accept.
   Last year, foreign ministers of the Association of South East
Asian Nations _ Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand _ called for a comprehensive solution to the
problem of refugees from Indochina.
   The flow continued to increase and Hong Kong has borne the brunt.
In 1988, it stopped granting automatic refugee status to all boat
people.
   Most refugees now come from northern Vietnam, often through
China, where many buy small boats for the final part of the journey.
   In May alone, Hong Kong's population of refugees and
asylum-seekers increased by one third _ nearly 9,000, more than the
total arrivals in all other coastal states of the region.
   Those accepted as refugees get work permits in the British
colony, where the legal minimum monthly salary is equal to about 2{
years' pay for a worker in Vietnam.
   Under the policy adopted in June 1988, Hong Kong treats boat
people as illegal immigrants and ``economic refugees'' unless they
can prove they fled political persecution. About nine of 10 are
being refused refugee status.
   After the number of refugees landing in the Philippines tripled,
authorities announced screening procedures in March and said all
people who could not prove political persecution would be sent back.
   Singapore refuses to let people ashore if they arrive in their
own boats. News reports say boats have been forced back to sea at
gunpoint along the Thai coast.
   Screening is only one element in a six-page draft plan to be
considered at the Geneva conference, which also includes an expanded
resettlement program. It relies on an international ``media
campaign'' to publicize the dangers and disadvantages of escaping by
boat and the benefits of regular emigration programs.
   The plan urges that Vietnamese refused refugee status be
encouraged to return home, and stipulates: ``If, after the passage
of reasonable time, it becomes clear that voluntary repatriation is
not making sufficient progress ... alternatives recognized as being
acceptable under international practices would be examined.''
   Only 143 Vietnamese have volunteered to go home since March
despite assurances from Hanoi that they can return safely. Many
people involved with the refugee program doubt a substantial
increase in the rate is possible.
   The Hong Kong chapter of the Oxfam relief agency supports
forcible return, combined with Western encouragement of more open
policies by Vietnam and help in developing the country's economy.
   At the conference, the United States is expected to lead
opposition to forcible repatriation. Vietnamese refugees living in
several Western countries arrived in Geneva to urge delegates to
treat the boat people ``with humanity.''
   ``Sending them back to hell from which they managed to escape .
.. would be totally inhuman,'' said a petition a French-based
committee claimed was signed by 20,000 Vietnamese emigres in the
past two weeks.

   President Bush today declared the states of
Ohio and Alaska eligible for disaster aid because of flooding caused
by heavy rains last month.
   The major disaster declarations clear the way for residents and
business owners in the affected areas to qualify for federal help.
   The Ohio disaster stemmed from heavy rains and flooding that
began May 23. The areas eligible for relief are the counties of
Butler, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Greene, Lake, Lorain, Mercer, re a
5.9-magnitude quake struck Oct. 1, 1987, and a 5.3 aftershock Oct. 4
caused $358 million in damage, eight deaths and 200 injuries.
However, today's quakes were not aftershocks to those quakes, said
Diane Barnhart, a spokeswoman for the Caltech.
   The shaker was reported felt as far east as Banning, 85 miles
east of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``It was like a ride at Magic Mountain where it just shakes and
shakes,'' said Joseph Libby in Torrance, about 15 miles south of
downtown. ``Some things fell of shelves, like books, but I can't see
any real damage.''
   The tremor shook City Hall violently for 12 to 15 seconds,
knocking plaster and ceiling fixtures down. Many employees were
evacuated from the Civic Center complex downtown. Other downtown
buildings also had cracked plaster.
   In the Silver Lake area near downtown, resident Cal Werner
reported feeling a sharp jolt. He said his dog ran barking down the
hall and ``he never barks at anything.''
   Los Angeles City fire tra seismograph.
   Some experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30
times greater.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

Bias</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An attorney for white firemen challenging
a racially tailored hiring plan in the Birmingham Fire Department
said today's U.S. Supreme Court ruling clears the way for white
firefighters to have their day in court.
   But an attorney for black firemen said the judicial system would
have to ignore history to rule against affirmative action in
Alabama's largest city.
   Ray Fitzpatrick, an attorney for the International Association of
Firefighters Local 17, representing white firemen, said the ruling
in the reverse discrimination case is a step toward ending
``race-based quota promotions'' that harm white firefighters in
Birmingham.
   City Fire Chief Neal Gallant declined comment. Neither Birmingham
City Attorney Jim Baker nor Mayor Richard Arrington could not be
reached immediately by telephone for comment.
   The court's decision, on a 5-4 vote, held that an affirmative
action plan agreed to by city officials and approved in court may be
attacked later by workers who took no part in the case leading to
the original agreement.
   New York attorney Robert Joffe, who represents black firefighters
in the case, said the decision is ``just another, unfortunately, in
a too long line of recent cases in which the Supreme Court has put
up road blocks in the way of affirmative action plaintiffs.''
   He said the Birmingham case would be a good test of an
affirmative action policy.
   ``You would have to ignore several hundred years of United States
history to find there wasn't sufficient record'' to warrant
affirmative action in Birmingham, he said.
   But Fitzpatrick said the Supreme Court decision means the city
``may no longer bind its unconsenting non-minority employees to an
agreement which those employees had no part in making.''
   ``Birmingham has engaged in race-based quota promotions and
claims it is protected by a consent decree to which the non-minority
employees were not a party,'' he said. ``We have simply tried to
obtain a day in court to contest the legality of the racial quotas
that Birmingham has been following.''
   Fitzpatrick added that the city ``has never been willing to
engage in any meaningful discussions with the white employees.''
   The Birmingham case began in 1974 when city officials and the
Jefferson County Personnel Board were sued by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and blacks
charging racial bias in the city fire department. Eventually both
sides reached agreement on a plan for the hiring and promotion of
minorities.
   The Birmingham Firefighters Association opposed the plan, but its
objections were rejected by a federal judge who issued consent
decrees in 1981 approving the agreement. Seven white firefighters
then challenged the promotion plan, saying less-qualified blacks
were being promoted ahead of them.
   Initially, a federal judge ruled that the white firefighters must
abide by the consent decree. But a federal appeals court in 1987
reinstated the suit, and the Supreme Court today agreed and cleared
the way for the white firefighters' case to be heard.

<HEAD>Court Limits Deadlines for Some Sex Bias Suits in Illinois Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today limited the deadlines
for filing some lawsuits that accuse employers of illegal sex bias.
   In a 5-3 ruling, the court threw out a suit by three women who
said a change in the seniority system at an AT&amp;T plant in Illinois
discriminated against them.
   The court said the women waited too long to sue.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the women had
300 days to sue from the time the seniority system change was
adopted _ not 300 days from the time they were affected personally
by the new seniority rules.
   Scalia said the shorter time period for suing applies to cases in
which an employer is accused of unintentional bias _ adopting rules
that on their face do not discriminate on the basis of sex.
   ``Allowing a facially neutral system to be challenged ... many
years after its adoption would disrupt'' the legitimate interests of
other workers who benefitted by the new rules, Scalia said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the
ruling shields acts of intentional discrimination.
   He said employees who are victims of bias must sue within 300
days of a change in the employer's system ``even if the employee ...
could not reasonably have expected to be demoted or otherwise
concretely harmed by the new system at the time of its adoption and,
indeed, even if the employee was not working in the affected
division of the company at the time of the system's adoption.''
   Such a severe interpretation of deadlines for suing violates
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawing discrimination
based on race or sex, he said.
   Justices Willima J. Brennan and Harry A. Blackmun joined
Marshall's dissent.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not take part in the ruling.
   The case involves Patricia A. Lorance, Janice M. King and Carol
S. Bueschen, employees in AT&amp;T's Montgomery Works in Aurora, Ill.
   They were demoted in 1982 because of a restructured seniority
system.
   Under the change, seniority for the skilled job of tester no
longer was determined on the basis of how long a worker was at the
plant but rather how long the employee worked as a tester.
   The change was incorporated into a contract between AT&amp;T
Technologies and Local 1942 of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.
   The three women said the change was designed to limit the job
rights of female workers who had been promoted recently into
traditionally male jobs.
   They filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in April 1983 _ within the 300-day time limit prescribed
by law if that period started with the date the revamped seniority
rules caused their demotions.
   But a federal magistrate in 1986 ruled the three waited too long
because they had not filed their complaint within 300 days of when
the new system was adopted in 1979.
   The magistrate's ruling was upheld by a federal trial judge, the
7th U.S. Cirucit Court of Appeals and today by the Supreme Court.
   The case is Lorance vs. AT&amp;T, 87-1428.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction
today that bars the state from enforcing its year-old obscenity law,
saying it is unconstitutionally vague and unfairly exempts libraries
and schools.
   Under the ruling by U.S. District Judge J.P. Stadtmueller, the
state may appeal to the federal Appeals Court or ask for a trial. If
the state does neither, the preliminary injunction would become
permanent and the law would have to be scrapped.
   Two Milwaukee stores, Denmark Book store and Paradise Video
Store, in addition to Pure Pleasure II Bookstore in Oshkosh, filed
suit in federal court against the state, calling the obscenity
statute unconstitutional.
   Since the law was passed last spring, no one has been criminally
prosecuted. The law, which was intended to halt commercial traffic
in hard-core pornography, calls for jail terms of up to five years
and fines of up to $10,000 for pornography wholesalers.
   Under the statute, material is obscene if it lacks serious
literary, artistic, political, educational or scientific value.
   Attorney General Donald J. Hanaway said today that he had not
seen the decision and would not comment yet.
   Stephen M. Glynn, the attorney representing the stores, called
the decision well-reasoned and said were very pleased by it.
   But a sponsor of the legislation, Sen. Joseph Andrea, said he was
disappointed by Stadtmueller's decision.
   Sponsors, he said, ``were very careful when we put this (the law)
together to address the constitutional concerns,'' Andrea said.
   In his decision, Stadtmueller said the statute was
unconstitutionally vague. The judge said it was difficult to
determine whether the law was violated by depicting sexually
explicit conduct, by describing sexually explicit conduct or both.
   In addition, Stadtmueller said the state violated the equal
protection clause of the Constitution by exempting libraries,
schools and universities from prosecution under the statute.
   The law allows a school library to commercially distribute
obscene materials without the threat of prosecution, but does not
allow an adult bookstore to do the same, the judge said.
   The judge also found unconstitutional the law's distinction
between contract printers and bookstore clerks. Under the statute,
the printers would not be threatened with prosecution, but the store
clerks would.
   Stadtmueller did rule in favor of the state, however, when he
said that the Legislature intended to include videotapes, as well as
film, under the statute.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, served notice on colleagues Monday that he will
oppose addition of special tax breaks for selected individuals or
businesses to any legislation written by the panel this year.
   ``As chairman, I have opposed and will continue to oppose any tax
amendments that unfairly benefit certain taxpayers while not
benefiting other similarly situated taxpayers,'' Bentsen, D-Texas,
said in a letter.
   ``Moreover, I have been forthcoming with information available to
me about the beneficiaries of tax legislation, and I plan to
continue that practice,'' he added.
   It has been almost routine practice for several years for members
of the Finance and House Ways and Means committees to attach
amendments benefiting one or two individuals or businesses to
general tax bills. The beneficiaries were seldom named in the
legislation.
   The practice was all but abandoned in 1988, apparently because of
the public outcry that followed inclusion of large numbers of
special breaks in the massive 1986 tax overhaul.
   Bentsen's committee is likely to write several tax bills this
year. On Tuesday, the panel will consider expanding tax credits for
child-care expenses and rewriting a 1986 provision requiring
employers to conduct complex tests to prove that their
health-insurance plans do not discriminate against lower-paid
workers.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today dismissed one of the 10
perjury counts against former Rep. Pat Swindall as the defense phase
of his trial got under way.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman said there was confusion
over what period of time was being discussed when Swindall testified
to a federal grand jury about his knowledge of a mortgage company.
He rejected defense motions to throw out the other nine counts as
well.
   Swindall, a Republican, was defeated in his bid for a third term
in the U.S. House last November, not long after he was indicted. He
represented a district in suburban Atlanta.
   He is charged with lying to a federal grand jury in February 1988
regarding his 1987 negotiations with an undercover agent posing as a
money launderer and with Swindall associate Charles LeChasney, later
convicted of money laundering. Many of the negotiations were taped
and played for the jury during the prosecution phase of the trial.
   The original charges cited 37 statements to the grand jury that
prosecutors said were false, grouping the statements into 10 perjury
charges. On Friday, Freeman ruled that five of the 37 statements
were irrelevant to the case, but he let all 10 counts stand until
this morning.
   The count dismissed today involved Swindall's knowledge of who
was to own the Gulf Coast Mortgage Co. that was created during
Swindall's negotiations for a $850,000 housing loan.
   The prosecution rested its case last week. The trial began last
month.
   Also today, Freeman cut short the testimony of Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., and said he would instruct the jury to disregard Frank's
comments in the hour he spent on the witness stand.
   The judge said the testimony of Frank, called by the defense to
describe the workings of Congress, might infringe on the
constitutional protection given to members of Congress for
performance of their duties.
   Frank had testified that Swindall was not a member of the
subcommittee that handled the money-laundering act of 1986 and that
most congressmen do not have time to learn specifics of all
legislation before Congress.
   At least two other congressmen, Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., and
Rep. J. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., also had been subpoenaed to testify
for the defense. But they had filed a motion seeking to have their
subpoenaes thrown out.
   Swindall himself is expected to take the stand, possibly as early
as this week. If convicted, he could faces up to five years in
prison on each count of perjury.

   A single factor, even the illegal practice
of plural marriage, should not have been the deciding factor in a
judge's refusal to allow a polygamist couple to adopt six motherless
children, an attorney told the Utah Supreme Court today.
   Instead, Vaughn and Sharane Fischer's other qualifications as
adoptive parents should have been considered in a full hearing by
the lower-court judge who denied the couple's petition to adopt the
children, whose mother had married Fischer, said attorney David
Nuffer.
   The court heard oral arguments today from Nuffer, representing
the Fischers, and attorney Timothy Anderson on behalf of the
children's grandfather and two aunts. The relatives opposed the
adoption following the death from cancer of the mother, Brenda
Thornton. In 1987 she had married Fischer, who had two other wives
and more than a dozen children, three months before her death and
assigned custody to the Fischer family.
   ``The question of what is best for the children is central to the
issue'' of whether the children should be permitted to remain in the
Fischer home in the polygamist southern Utah town of Hildale, said
Nuffer.
   But Anderson told the five justices that, like slavery, polygamy
was ``an anathema to society'' that was ended with good reason in
the 19th century.
   The Mormon Church dropped polygamy as a tenet of its faith in
1890 in exchange for statehood. However, an estimated 20,000 to
30,000 still practice plural marriage, although they are
excommunicated from the church if they do so.
   Practicing polygamy is a second-degree felony in Utah, although
the law has not been actively enforced in more than three decades.
   The case does not hinge on the Fischers' right to hold to their
fundamentalist Mormon beliefs, but on the state's responsibility to
protect children from being taught practices that are clearly
illegal, Anderson said.
   The court will rule later on the matter. The Fischers want the
justices to remand the case back to 5th Circuit Court for a full
hearing on the issues.
   Before her death, Ms. Thornton and Fischer signed a legal
document relinquishing custody of her children to the Fischer
family. In it, Ms. Thornton said she felt Vaughn and Sharane Fischer
would be good parents. The children's biological father, Phil
Thornton, consented to the release of the children to the Fischers.
   But late last year, a judge dismissed an adoption petition filed
by the Fischers, though he stayed the decision giving them a chance
to appeal. In dismissing the petition, Judge Dean E. Conder said the
case centered on one issue: whether the Fischers' polygamist
lifestyle should disqualify them from adopting the children, then
ranging in age from 5 to 19.
   While the case was on appeal, the children continued to live with
the Fischers in their 14-bedroom house.
   Ms. Thornton's stepsister, Pat Johanson, said the original
custody transfer was signed under pressure from the fundamentalists
and Ms. Thornton really wanted her to take the children.
   Five weeks before Ms. Thornton died, Ms. Johanson moved from her
Washington, D.C., home to Hildale to be at her stepsister's bedside.
She says that the dying woman confided that she wanted the children
out of fundamentalism, but at the same time didn't want to do
anything openly, fearing excommunication.
   Ms. Johanson also said that the three youngest Thornton children,
Julia, Janelle, and Deanne, came forward one at a time to say they
did not want to live with the Fischers.
   But Steven Snow, attorney for the Fischers, has disputed the
deathbed conversations and statements concerning the children.
   A friend of the court brief filed by the American Civil Liberties
Union of Utah Foundation on behalf of the Fischers argues that
polygamy should be permitted in the state.
   Polygamy was sanctioned by the early Mormon Church, but after it
was banned by the state, the church condemned and distanced itself
from the practice. However, some fundamentalist offshoots of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints still believe in the
practice.

   AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
   
   The court, in a major setback for affirmative action, expanded
the ability of white men to challenge court-approved plans giving
preferential treatment to minorities and women in government jobs.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices handed civil rights advocates their
latest defeat in the case of white Birmingham, Ala., firefighters
who say they are victims of reverse discrimination.
   The case is Martin vs. Wilks, 87-1614.
   
   DEATH PENALTY
   
   The court ruled that a jury choosing between the death penalty
and a life prison term for a convicted murderer generally may not be
told about the victim's personal characteristics.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that a South Carolina murderer
unfairly was sentenced to death after a prosecutor told jurors that
the victim was a religious, community-minded person.
   The case is South Carolina vs. Gathers, 88-305.
   
   DISCOUNTS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether manufacturers legally may give
some discounts to wholesalers but not retailers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Texaco Inc., ordered to
pay $1.38 million in antitrust damages to 12 service stations in the
Spokane, Wash., area.
   The case is Texaco vs. Hasbrouck, 87-2048.
   
   HAZARDOUS WASTE
   
   The court turned down an appeal by companies involved in treating
hazardous waste aimed at forcing the government to adopt tougher
environmental rules.
   The justices, without comment, refused to let the firms sue for
stricter standards that could increase their business volume or give
them a competitive advantage over other waste-treatment companies.
   The case is Hazardous Waste Treatment Council vs. Environmental
Protection Agency, 88-1532.
   
   ASPIRIN
   
   The court rejected an appeal by an aspirin manufacturer being
sued for $10 million by the parents of a child who contracted Reyes
Syndrome.
   The court, without comment, let stand a Wisconsin judge's order
that the maker of Bayer aspirin reveal numerous company records.
   The case is Sterling Drug vs. Circuit Court of Milwaukee, 88-1691.
   
   DISABILITY
   
   The court made it easier to recover lawyers' fees for people who
win disputes with the government over Social Security benefits.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the government must reimburse legal
fees incurred during administrative proceedings that a federal court
has ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Hudson, 88-616.
   
   GRIZZLIES
   
   The court refused to let Montana sheep owners kill grizzly bears
threatening their herds.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that the
owners have a constitutional right to protect their property _ even
if it means killing animals designated an endangered species.
   The case is Christy vs. Lujan, 88-1461.
   
   MARINE`S DEATH
   
   The court turned away the case of a Marine who died after his
wisdom tooth was pulled, and left intact a legal doctrine barring
members of the military from suing over injuries suffered ``incident
to service.''
   The court, without comment, refused to reinstate lawsuits against
the government by the widow of Marine Sgt. Timothy Adkins, whose
death in 1985 sparked three separate investigations by the Marines
and Navy.
   The case is Adkins vs. U.S., 88-1776.
   
   PLEA BARGAIN
   
   The court bolstered the power of judges to impose harsher
penalties on criminal defendants who back out of plea-bargained
agreements that called for lighter sentences.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, apparently reinstated the life
sentence of an Alabama man convicted of burglary.
   The case is Alabama vs. Smith, 88-333.
   
   SENIORITY
   
   The court limited the deadlines for filing some lawsuits that
accuse employers of illegal sex bias.
   In a 5-3 ruling, the court threw out a suit by three women who
said a change in the seniority system at an AT&amp;T plant in Illinois
discriminated against them.
   The court said the women waited too long to sue.
   The case is Lorance vs. AT&amp;T, 87-1428.
   
   MAGISTRATES
   
   The court ruled unanimously that federal magistrates are not
legally authorized to preside over jury selection even when
delegated such duty by federal trial judges.
   The justices threw out the federal convictions in New York City
of two men accused of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute
it. The court said the convictions were tainted because the judge
who presided over their trial assigned the task of presiding over
jury selection to a federal magistrate.
   The cases are Gomez vs. U.S., 88-5014, and Chavez-Tesina vs.
U.S., 88-5158.

   Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday denied
that Westerners held hostage in Lebanon had been moved to Tehran.
   Iran has no information on the whereabouts of the Westerners
missing in Lebanon, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said,
quoting an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   The reports were rumors circulated by the international media,
according to the agency, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   The Observer, a London newspaper, reported this week that six
Western hostages _ five Americans and one Briton _ were moved to
Iran to ensure their safety. The newspaper, quoting unidentified
sources in Beirut, Damascus and Tehran, did not identify the
Americans but said the Briton was journalist John McCarthy.
   The Observer said McCarthy and two of the Americans were
disguised as injured Lebanese, transferred to the Syrian capital on
May 24 and flown to Tehran. The newspaper said three other Americans
were moved to Iran on May 29.
   It said Iran's interior minister, Ali Akbar Mohtashami, decided
to move the hostages after fighting intensified between Christian
and Syrian forces in and around Beirut.
   Most of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon are believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite extremist factions. Held longest is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Previous reports that hostages had been moved to Iran also could
not be confirmed.

   Design teams based in Chicago, Philadelphia,
New York and Georgia were selected as finalists today in competition
to build a memorial to women in the military service at the entrance
to Arlington National Cemetery.
   Retired Army Brig. Gen. Wilma L. Vaught, president of the Women
in Military Service for America Foundation, said three of the four
would each receive a $10,000 prize.
   Nine teams received honorable mention and one of them, made up of
Stephen D. Siegle and Margaret Derwent of Chicago, was invited to
continue in the second stage of the competition.
   The winner is to be chosen in November.
   Winners of the $10,000 prizes were:
   _ Teresa Norton of Tybee Island, Ga., and associates Cleve Harp,
David Overholt, Sergio Chavarria, Peter S. Christman, Martha Enzmann
and Ming T. Shaing, for a design built around a grove of bronze
trees and an underground Hall of Heroines.
   _ Gregory A. Galford and Maria L. Antonis of Philadelphia, for a
design featuring a platform with a view of the cemetery and the
Kennedy gravesite, plus a spiral depression in which names of women
now in military service would be engraved.
   _ Michael A. Manfredi of New York and associates Marion G. Weiss,
Ellen D. Sands and Thomas Schumacher of Washington, for an arc of 10
tall glass pylons which would glow at night and a series of stairs
piercing the niches in the existing gate at Arlington.
   The jury recommended making the Siegle-Derwent entry an
alternate, in case one of the top three dropped out. But Vaught said
the foundation decided to make it a finalist because it was the only
design that called for building a cultural-educational center behind
the existing structure. She said the foundation wanted this concept
explored further along with the others.
   The other honorable mention winners were Barbara Lynn Allen and
Lex Bradford Ulibarria of Honolulu; Madge W. Bemiss of Philadelphia;
Barbara G. Christensen and Ralph Morgan Christensen of Seattle;
Merrill Caldwell Gaines, Cheryl M. Caputi, Christopher E. Craig, Una
M. Kinsella, Scott D. Looney, Eileen Mary O'Shea, Apurva G. Patel
and Patricia Ann Wilder of San Luis, Obispo, Calif.; William Jude
LeBlanc and Ellen Durham-Jones, Charlottesville, Va.; Andrew G.
Ryczek of Bronx, N.Y.; Terry Van Dyne of New York; and Bruce
Northwood White of New York.
   The memorial, authorized by Congress, is to be built with private
funds on a four-acre site at the ceremonial gate to Arlington
Cemetery, just across Memorial Bridge from Washington on the
Virginia side of the Potomac River. Legislation passed in 1986 calls
for ground to be broken in 1991.

   A grove of bronze trees, a cluster of
illuminated glass prisms and a platform overlooking Arlington
National Cemetery were among features of surviving designs Monday in
the first phase of competition to select a memorial to women in
military service.
   The ultimate winner from the finalists will be selected in
November by five judges.
   Retired Army Brig. Gen. Wilma L. Vaught, president of the Women
in Military Service for America Foundation, said $10,000 prizes were
awarded to three teams.
   They were Teresa Norton of Tybee Island, Ga., and associates
Cleve Harp, David Overholt, Sergio Chavarria, Peter S. Christman,
Martha Enzmann and Ming T. Shaing; Gregory A. Galford and Maria L.
Antonis of Philadelphia; and Michael A. Manfredi of New York and
associates Marion G. Weiss, Ellen D. Sands and Thomas Schumacher of
Washington.
   The memorial is to be built with private funds with ground
breaking by 1991, in accordance with legislation passed by Congress
in 1986. It is to be located at, and is designed to complete, the
memorial gate of Arlington Cemetery. The gate was left unfinished
during the Depression.
   Harp said the grove of 49 trees in the Georgia team's design was
designed to symbolize a guard of sentries. He said an underground
hall would be lit from above through a glass floor allowing the
shadows of the trees to fall into the hall. The plan also calls for
a waterfall in connection with the pool that is a feature of the
memorial gate.
   Galford said the Philadelphia team's design would include a
spiraling ramp recessed into the four-acre site in front of the
gate. He said it also would include rooms dedicated to women's role
in each of America's wars, and a platform overlooking the cemetery
and the grave of John F. Kennedy.
   Manfredi said the New York-Washington entry would involve 10
clear glass prisms, illuminating exhibits telling the story of women
in the military. The spires would be about 18 feet high, he said.
The 10 niches of the existing structure would be pierced by stairs
and become gateways to the cemetery.
   Gen. Vaught said judges recommended making a fourth entry,
submitted by Stephen D. Siegle and Margaret Derwent of Chicago, an
alternate in case one of the other three dropped out. Instead, she
said, the foundation chose to makle the Chicago entry an additional
finalist, although its designers did not share in the prize money.
   Unlike the other entries, the Siegle-Derwent design calls for
building an educational-cultural center.

   Key discoveries in the effects of radiation, the
genetics of cancer and substances that regulate development of blood
cells have earned cancer prizes for five researchers.
   The three General Motors Cancer Research Foundation Prizes, each
worth $130,000, will be presented Wednesday in Washington.
   Mortimer Elkind of Colorado State University in Fort Collins will
receive a prize for his studies of the biological effects of
radiation.
   His work made it possible for tens of thousands of cancer
patients a year to receive radiation therapy safely and effectively,
the foundation said.
   The research is being used to define permissible levels of
radiation exposure from medical X-rays, nuclear plants, radon and
other sources, the foundation said.
   A second prize will be shared by Peter Nowell of the University
of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and Janet Rowley
of the University of Chicago. Their work dealt with chromosomes,
thread-like bodies that carry genes.
   Nowell was a co-discoverer of the first consistent chromosome
abnormality in cancer, which led to research linking more than 100
such defects to cancer, the foundation said.
   Rowley revealed that the abnormality occurred when the ends of
two particular chromosomes switched places.
   The third prize will be shared by Donald Metcalf of the Walter
and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Victoria, Australia,
and Leo Sachs of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot,
Israel.
   They independently discovered substances called colony
stimulating factors, which regulate growth, maturation and
production of blood cells, the foundation said. The substances are
used to increase production of disease-fighting cells in patients at
high risk of infection, such as cancer patients on chemotherapy.

<HEAD>US Indicates It Will Not Hand Over Dissident Fang</HEAD>

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
opened talks with China's ambassador here in an effort to resolve
the case of two dissidents being sheltered in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, it was disclosed today.
   Baker called Ambassador Han Xu to his office on Saturday and the
envoy was summoned back on Sunday for another talk with Robert
Kimmitt, the undersecretary for political affairs, State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said today.
   The conversations dealt with Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist, and
his wife, Li Shuxian, an assistant professor at Beijing University.
They were accused of counter-revolutionary activities and warrants
for their arrest were issued Sunday.
   `We`re trying to resolve it,'' said a senior official who
declined to be identified.
   Ms. Tutwiler, meanwhile, challenged Chinese assertions that
hundreds of protesting students were not slain by army troops on
June 3.
   ``The whole world has seen what happened in Tiananmen Square,''
she said. ``Large numbers of peaceful demonstrators were killed by
army units. We condemn the use of live fire against unarmed
civilians, which is what happened in Tiananmen Square.''
   The spokeswoman said the demonstrators were seeking basic human
rights. ``Labeling such people counter-revolutionaries and hooligans
will do nothing to alter the reality of what happened in Tiananmen
Square on June 3,'' she said.
   Earlier today, the Bush administration indicated it would not
permit the Chinese to arrest the two dissidents who took refuge in
the embassy.
   ``When a person presents himself to one of our embassies and says
he is imminent danger and we have reason to give it credence
sometimes we grant refuge,'' a U.S. official said. ``And when we do
that, I ask you `What does it mean?'''
   The administration, in dealing with the crackdown on dissidents
and other pro-democracy forces, is trying not to inflame the
situation by denouncing Chinese authorities.
   But the statement by the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, indicated that any attempt to arrest Fang and Li would be
resisted.
   The charges against the two dissidents could amount to
accusations of treason and, amid the turmoil in China, carry the
threat of a death sentence.
   The Beijing government warned that leaders of independent groups
who refuse to surrender will be arrested ``and dealt with severely.''
   Meanwhile, U.S.-Chinese relations have turned sour. President
Bush has suspended military sales to Beijing and all Americans
except diplomats were urged to leave the country.
   James Lilley, the U.S. ambassador to China, said today ``the
jury's still out'' on how the situation will unfold.
   ``Right now we have the semblance of order and control,'' he said
on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Certainly Beijing is an
orderly city right now. But I think that we have to wait and see.''
   Lilley declined to discuss the Fang situation, saying ``it's too
sensitive... If you get up and start posturing, it lessens the
chance of getting something done.''
   In a separate interview with NBC-TV's ``Today'' program, Lilley
said he hoped the dispute over Fang and Li was ``not volatile at
all.''
   ``We hope that it's settled and it's out of the way fairly
soon,'' he said.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, said when asked
about Fang: ``It's our judgment it's not helpful in any way to
comment.'' He added that the administration was ``considering this
situation.''
   A reporter called out a question about Fang to President Bush at
the start of a meeting with congressional leaders.
   The lawmakers took that as their cue to break out into a hearty
chorus of ``Happy Birthday, Mr. President'' for Bush, who turned 65
today. Bush laughed and reporters were quickly escorted out of the
room.

<TEXT>
   Residents of this resort town
were stunned to hear their mayor and his wife were among 18 people
nabbed in a 20-month undercover drug and money laundering
investigation.
   Mayor Terry Trupp and his wife, Kim, were taken into custody
Sunday for allegedly trying to launder about $750,000 to FBI and
Internal Revenue Service agents, the bureau and other agencies
announced at a joint news conference.
   Later at the South Lake Tahoe police station, authorities
displayed a variety of evidence seized during the day. The items
included bags of cocaine, $100 bills, shotguns and pistols, and a
hollow walking cane with a detachable golden eagle's head that
concealed a cocaine vial.
   No drugs were seized in the Trupps' arrests, authorities said.
   The Trupps, being held without bail in El Dorado County jail,
were arraigned today before U.S. Magistrate Monte Reece in South
Lake Tahoe. The other people arrested also were being held without
bail.
   The Trupps did not speak and entered no plea. Reece handed them
over to U.S. marshals to be taken to Sacramento for a detention and
bail hearing.
   ``I'm saddened by the arrest of the mayor, but I think it goes a
long way to show that no one is out of the reach of law enforcement
and drugs,'' said Police Chief Dean Shelton.
   He added that he was proud his department was one of the agencies
involved in the operation.
   Neva Roberts, mayor pro tem of this city of about 30,000, said
she was ``stunned beyond measurement'' by Trupp's arrest.
   ``The city has suffered a deep, deep wound,'' she said.
   ``I think we'll find a great deal of surprise here,'' said Del
Laine, a former mayor. ``But we'll have to leave the process to the
legal efforts of law enforcement and the justice system.''
   Seventeen of those arrested were taken into custody Sunday, and
one was arrested Friday, police and agents of the FBI, IRS, and Drug
Enforcement Administration said. Two fugitives also are being sought.
   All are suspected of being involved in cocaine trafficking or
efforts to launder money from drug sales, authorities said.
   Trupp was first elected to the City Council in 1978, and was
chosen by his fellow council members to be mayor in 1981, 1982 and
1989. His term as mayor expires at the end of the month, and his
term on the council ends in 1990. Trupp has said he would not seek
re-election.
   Trupp allegedly laundered $108,000 for IRS undercover agents last
August, said Steven Giorgi, the agency's chief criminal investigator.
   ``Since August of 1988 he has met with IRS undercover agents a
number of occasions to launder over $600,000, knowing full well that
the money was from an alleged illegal activity, and that activity
was narcotics activity,'' Giorgi said.
   Authorities did not elaborate on Mrs. Trupp's alleged involvement.
   Five of the other 16 arrested, all from South Lake Tahoe, were
taken into custody on federal drug trafficking charges, and two Los
Angeles men were arrested on federal money laundering charges,
authorities said. Eight South Lake Tahoe residents were arrested on
state drug charges.
   The investigation, begun in October 1987, took place in South
Lake Tahoe, Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Jose, Reno and San Diego,
officials said.

   Foreign reporters covering China's crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters no longer have bullets whizzing past their
heads, but some said Monday their job has become harder in the
growing climate of fear.
   Television crews have had their film or equipment confiscated and
been forced to write ``self-criticisms.'' Other reporters have been
stopped by police from talking to people on the street or have had
notebooks taken. A British reporter was expelled from Shanghai.
   The Australian Embassy expressed grave concern Monday over the
safety of its country's journalists, saying, ``From what we've seen
the last few days we can't seriously expect the police or troops to
be fussy about who they shoot.''
   Sources also are drying up. Chinese said they fear talking to
reporters even in private as the number of reported arrests in
connection with seven weeks of pro-democracy protests neared 1,000.
   ``You have to be so careful,'' said Jan Wong of the Toronto Globe
and Mail. ``I don't want to ask people (on the street) their names
... for their protection.''
   TV crews that already were taking precautions when shooting
photographs to avoid detection by security officials said a new
damper was put on their work by the government use of an ABC
videotape to track down a Chinese man.
   China Central Television apparently intercepted the unedited
video as ABC sent it by satellite to New York. It showed a
42-year-old worker claiming that 20,000 people were killed when the
army fired on student protesters and supporters June 3-4.
   CCTV broadcast the interview and urged viewers to find the man.
Two women reported him within hours and he was arrested.
   ABC said it was ``deeply distressed'' over the use of its tape
and began covering the faces of students it interviewed.
   Mike Chinoy, Beijing bureau chief of the Cable News Network, said
some CNN footage also has been used on Chinese TV, although no
arrests have been reported as a result.
   ``Even the people I know with the most extensive contacts among
the Chinese are not talking to them because they don't want to get
them in trouble,'' Chinoy said. ``I'm depressed _ profoundly. I
think it's going to change living and working in China.''
   No news organizations said they were pulling reporters out of
China because of the difficulties, but CNN's Vito Maggiolo said some
of the 25 staff now in Beijing might leave by week's end.
   ``The story has gone behind the scenes and underground to a great
extent,'' he said. ``There's much less to see.''
   Chinoy said, ``The irony is that after a period in which it had
gotten easier and the government had become tolerant of a huge range
of reporting ... All of a sudden it's reverted to a decade ago.
We've been forced to cover China the way China watchers did when it
was a closed society, reading (the official) Xinhua (News Agency),
talking to diplomats and each other.''
   Under the martial law imposed in Beijing May 20, reporters are
barred from conducting interviews on the streets, on campuses, at
factories and other sites without official permission. Photographing
and making audio tapes also are forbidden. Most reporters have
ignored the restrictions.
   Many news organizations have sent reporters to Shanghai despite
official warning they need permission to work there.
   On Saturday, China expelled a reporter for Britain's Independent
Television News who was photographing student protesters outside
Shanghai police headquarters. He was questioned and put on a plane
to Hong Kong.
   More expulsions were expected. China expelled two reporters after
the last major student demonstrations, in 1986-87.
   Several camera crews for the BBC have been detained by police for
photographing on the street, and in one case were forced at gunpoint
to kneel on the ground. In the most recent incident, reporter Brian
Barron said he and his crew had their passports confiscated Sunday,
were told to write self-criticisms and ordered not to leave China
without permission.
   Another Western TV network that asked not to be identified said a
crew was detained and released only after writing self-criticisms.
In most cases, such self-criticisms have consisted of accounts of
what the reporters were doing, with some apologies for
inconveniencing officials.
   Adi Ignatius of the Wall Street Journal said he scuffled Saturday
with plainclothes security who tried to detain him at the Beijing
Normal University campus. He said he broke free of the men, who did
not identify themselves, and got in his car. They kicked the car
door and broke the mirror as he drove away.
   The only foreign news organization to be criticized publicly is
the Voice of America. The official media has castigated it daily
since Friday for alleged distortions. VOA frequencies have been
jammed for weeks.
   ``We've been criticized in the past by the media and officials,''
said VOA Beijing bureau chief Alan Pessin. ``This is unprecedented
in length and scope. They're engaged in an extensive effort to
rewrite the history of the past 10 days. Their tirades against VOA
are only a part of that.''

   A private plane crashed into a wooded
area near here this morning after striking the wing of another plane
that landed safely, officials said. At least one person was killed.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Gail Lattrell said
the pilot of a Cessna 210 bound from Teterborough, N.J., to
Portland, Maine, radioed Boston air traffic controllers about 9:20
a.m. The Cessna managed to land at Portland.
   ``He reported that he struck another aircraft with his left wing
near Gardner,'' she said.
   The FAA spokeswoman said it was not immediately clear how many
people were aboard the plane whose wreckage was discovered near
Hubbardston, but said state police and federal officials were at the
scene.
   ``The wreckage was found. The pilot died,'' she said. ``But we
don't know if there were any other passengers or the extent of
damage to the plane.''
   Lattrell identified the pilot who managed to make his Maine
destination safely as Sheldon Gould, a New York businessman.
   She said passenger Paul Schief, of Brentwood, N.Y., was also
uninjured in the accident, which left the single-engine plane with
minor damage to its left wing.
   ``An airplane at my altitude where it shouldn't have been just
came right at me, and I just swerved and managed to save the
airplane by having the tip of the wing caught and nothing else,''
Gould said this morning in an interview with television station WCSH
in Portland.
   Portland International Jetport emergency crews gathered as air
traffic controllers guided the hobbled plane to a safe landing about
10 a.m.
   ``We picked him up down around Kennebunk, and we worked him into
Portland,'' Wayne Owen said at the Portland airport. ``His left wing
was damaged, and that's about all I can say.''

<HEAD>Superpowers Sign Agreement to Prevent Accidental War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union signed an
agreement Monday intended to keep straying warplanes or other
``dangerous military activities'' from starting a war by accident.
   It was signed at the Defense Ministry Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev,
the Soviet chief of staff, and Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman
of the U.S. joint chiefs. Crowe began an 11-day official visit to
the Soviet Union on Monday.
   In remarks prepared for the ceremony, Crowe called the agreement
an unprecedented effort to develop procedures ``intended to diminish
tensions and dangers associated with military activities.''
   He said the 19-page accord, worked out in nine months of
negotiations, illustrated how far relations have advanced toward ``a
more sustainable, larger relationship between our countries.''
   Before joining Crowe in a champagne toast, Moiseyev said the
agreement, which takes effect, Jan. 1, will make it possible for the
two nations ``to solve all the problems they share in a more
constructive way.''
   The agreement is intentionally limited in scope and does not
treat some areas covered by other agreements. Among those were the
shooting death of a U.S. Army major in East Germany in 1985 and the
bumping of two U.S. Navy ships by Soviet vessels in the Black Sea
last year.
   It covers the accidental straying of military units into the
other's territory; hazardous use of laser range finders that could
blind the other country's soldiers or sailors; hampering the other
country's military operations in a tense area, like the Persian Gulf
during the Iran-Iraq war; and interfering with command and
communications networks.
   Maj. Gen. George L. Butler of the Air Force, deputy director of
strategic planning on Crowe's staff, told a news briefing the
agreement gives radio frequencies and code phrases for contacting
military aircraft, ships or ground units that go a stray.
   Butler also said, however, that it did not cover some areas in
which trouble has arisen in the past. The general led the U.S.
negotiating team.
   One example Butler mentioned was the bumping of the U.S. Navy
ships by Soviet vessels Feb. 12, 1988, off Crimea. He said that was
addressed by a term in maritime law defining the ``right of innocent
passage,'' and negotiators were considering the incident separately.
   Maj. Arthur Nicholson was shot and killed by Soviet soldiers in
East Germany on March 24, 1985. Butler said such problems would not
be affected by the document signed Monday because they fell under a
1947 agreement regulating activities of the wartime Allies' military
personnel in Germany.
   U.S.-Soviet talks were held after Nicholson's death to clarify
the 1947 accord and prevent a recurrence, Butler said.
   He said the ``Dangerous Military Activities Agreement'' also is
not designed to prevent the destruction of civilian aircraft, as
when the Soviets shot down a South Korean airliner that entered
their airspace in 1985, killing all 269 people aboard.
   The chief Soviet negotiator, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Bolyatko, said
measures to protect civilian aircraft were being considered by the
International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency based in
Montreal.
   Crowe's visit follows a tour of the United States in July by
Moiseyev's predecessor, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, now an adviser
to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The vice chiefs of staff of the
four U.S. services accompanied Crowe.
   On Tuesday, he is to watch Soviet aerial maneuvers at a base near
Moscow. The admiral is scheduled to visit Murmansk, Leningrad,
Minsk, Volgograd, Tashkent, Samarkand and the Black Sea resort of
Sochi.
   Tass, the official news agency, said Crowe also would visit the
missile cruiser Kirov and a training range of Soviet marine
infantry, and inspect Soviet military hardware.

   Raisa Gorbachev on Monday toured the
narrow hallways and cramped rooms of Ludwig van Beethoven's
18th-century birthplace and said the composer occupies a special
place in Russian hearts.
   Beethoven ``is one of the world's greatest musical geniuses,''
Mrs. Gorbachev said as she visited the modest structure on the
fringes of Bonn's historic old town.
   The wife of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev toured the
house, now a museum, in a ceremony formalizing an exchange program
of young musicians from the Soviet Union and West Germany.
   She was accompanied by Hannelore Kohl, the wife of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   Outside the museum, about 20 demonstrators huddled on a nearby
sidewalk carrying placards protesting alleged Soviet atrocities in
Afghanistan.
   The protest was overshadowed by hundreds of well-wishers who
shouted ``Raisa! Raisa!'' and waved as she arrived by limousine.
   After a brief ceremony that included a performance of several of
Beethoven's works, the two first ladies toured the tiny green house
now surrounded by tall modern buildings and busy shops.
   ``It's amazing that such great men can be born in such small
rooms,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said.
   ``Beethoven is in all of our hearts,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said,
referring to the Soviet people's appreciation of the German master.
   During the tour, Mrs. Gorbachev displayed intense interest in the
house's history and appearance. At one point she stumbled in the
courtyard, but Mrs. Kohl quickly grabbed her arm to keep her from
falling.
   Mrs. Kohl told her Beethoven was born in a part of the house
behind an inner courtyard that was heavily damaged by bombs during
World War II. She said restoration efforts were continuing there.
   The museum in the front part of the building is open to the
public and displays period furniture, a piano used by Beethoven, and
other artifacts.
   Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770, and lived there until age 13.
He died in 1827.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
on Monday welcomed U.S. proposals to reduce conventional forces in
Europe and said they could result in a speedier agreement between
the superpowers.
   But Gorbachev, in his first state visit to West Germany, stressed
during a dinner given by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that the Kremlin
still wants simultaneous talks to be held on reducing short-range
nuclear weapons.
   Gorbachev, enormously popular in West Germany, arrived in Bonn
amid much fanfare Monday as he seeks to strengthen ties to West
Germany and bridge the ideological differences that divide the
continent.
   ``Today, we can already state that we have started to leaf
through the first pages of a new chapter in our relations,''
Gorbachev said at the gathering in Bonn's resplendent Redoute palace.
   Kohl, meanwhile, appealed to Gorbachev for a unilateral Soviet
cut in short-range nuclear missiles. Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov conceded at a briefing earlier that
the Warsaw Pact has an advantage in such weapons.
   Gorbachev said the alliance would wait until its next meeting,
expected in July, before giving a detailed response to President
Bush's proposals for substantial cuts in East-bloc and Western
armies in Europe by the early 1990s.
   He said the Soviets already had noted ``with satisfaction'' that
the West had produced proposals and accepted some Eastern
suggestions.
   ``There is now reason to presume that an agreement in Vienna can
be reached much more quickly than was expected earlier,'' Gorbachev
said, referring to the site of East-West talks on conventional
weapons.
   But he stressed the Soviet Union still wants parallel talks on
reducing short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   The issue has caused squabbling within the NATO alliance
recently. West Germany demanded talks soon on reducing short-range
nuclear weapons, while the United States said a conventional arms
reduction must be negotiated first because of Soviet superiority in
non-nuclear weapons.
   The disagreement was resolved with a compromise during a NATO
summit last week when the Western alliance agreed that a partial
reduction of short-range nuclear weapons could be negotiated.
   About 120 dignitaries were invited to the dinner in the opulent
palace. Gorbachev was accompanied by his wife, Raisa.
   Bonn government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl briefed Gorbachev
thoroughly on the NATO summit and the Bush proposals during 70
minutes of talks.
   The state visit, which comes as Soviet troops try to quell a
bloody ethnic dispute in the republic of Uzbekistan, began amid
strong assurances from both sides that the nations that helped to
divide Europe now want to overcome that rift.
   The two countries already intend bolster their commercial,
cultural and political links Tuesday by signing 11 agreements and a
``common statement'' of purpose that Klein said is ``a very
significant, even historic document.''
   The declaration will ``satisfy the very profound desire our
peoples have to heal the wounds of the past with understanding and
reconciliation and to build a better future,'' Kohl said at the
dinner.
   Klein said Kohl urged the Soviet leader to make ``quick
progress'' at the Vienna talks on reducing conventional arms.
   ``We are not against quick progress in the Vienna talks, we're
for it,'' Gerasimov said at the briefing with Klein. ``We will be
ready to negotiate in a constructive spirit'' once Bush's proposals
are on the table in Vienna in September, Gerasimov added.
   In a brief statement to reporters at Kohl's office, Gorbachev
said that since Kohl's visit to Moscow in October ``we have
accomplished a lot, we've worked together to reach this level of
cooperation.''
   West German newspapers have heralded the Gorbachev visit with
much fanfare, and television on Monday broadcast live coverage of
his arrival and several of the events on his first day.
   The Gorbachevs were greeted with a 21-gun salute. They
encountered their first crowd of well-wishers, a group of invited
Soviet children and West German exchange students outside the
official residence of President Richard von Weizsaecker.
   Ordinary West Germans were kept far away from the Soviet leader
by a tight cordon of security that had helicopters buzzing all day
over the capital.

<HEAD>New Policies Seen If Tax Credit Becomes Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health insurance companies will develop new
policies to cover children of low-income Americans if a proposal to
offer parents a tax credit of up to $500 to help pay for the
premiums becomes law, an industry official predicted Monday.
   Mary Nell Lehnhard, vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue
Shield Association, told the Senate Finance Committee there were an
estimated 11 million children in the United States with no health
insurance in 1985 _ about three-fourths of them in familes with
annual incomes of $20,000 or less.
   She said a survey of the association's 75 health plans nationwide
suggested that roughly half of the small employers who provide some
health insurance coverage for their workers do not pay anything
toward coverage for their dependents.
   In supporting a tax credit proposal by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, Ms. Lehnhard said the Medicaid health program for the poor
``frequently forces parents to choose between going to work in a
low-paying job _ with unaffordable health benefits for themselves
and-or their dependents _ or remaining on Medicaid to assure that
their children have access to health care services.''
   Adopting the Finance Committee chairman's plan, she said, would
give families increased ability to purchase coverage for their
children under employer-sponsored health plans and also allow more
low-income families to buy policies if there is no health plan where
they work.
   ``We believe that private health insurance markets will respond
to these incentives by making available low-cost products with the
objective of reaching children,'' said Ms. Lehnhard.
   As an example, she cited a Blue Shield of California program
introduced last summer that establishes special rates for children
in two age categories _ 1 to 4 years old and 5 to 18.
   She said a typical policy covering a child 5 to 18 would cost the
parent $250 a year. For a child 1 to 4, the cost would be $320.
   The Bentsen bill, to be acted on by the panel Tuesday, also would
extend an existing child care tax credit to lower income workers by
making them eligible for a cash refund if they did not have to pay
enough federal income tax to take advantage of the benefit the way
it is now structured.
   Willis B. Goldbeck, president of the Washington Business Group on
Health, said the major employers his organization represents
supports both the child care and health care tax credits in the
Bentsen bill.
   He said the programs are intended for ``people most in need.''
   ``They are the ones trying hardest to maintain the American work
ethic rather than falling prey to the cycle of poverty that we all
know is far more expensive to society than the cost of your proposed
tax credit,'' he told Bentsen.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Students Protesting Police Raid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police on Monday arrested about a dozen
radical students who were trying to protest a police raid and the
seizure of pro-North Korea pamphlets.
   About 600 students rallied at Sogang University had tried to
march to a nearby police station, but about 1,000 riot police
carrying shields blocked their passage and made the arrests. No
injuries were reported.
   Police raided the university Friday and seized more than 2,000
pamphlets on a youth festival to be held July 1-8 in Pyongyang, the
capital of North Korea.
   The government has banned South Koreans from taking part in the
sports and cultural event but many students have said they will try
to participate anyway. The festival is for students from Third World
and communist nations.
   The pre-dawn raid came amid a crackdown on anti-government
protests.
   At nearby Yonsei University, about 400 radical students rallied
for two hours in front of the school, then dispersed voluntarily.
They demanded the release of student leaders arrested by police on
Saturday in violent anti-government street demonstrations. Police
made no arrests.
   In Pusan, the nation's second-largest city, 800 students from two
universities hurled rocks at riot police and denounced the
government ban on attending the youth festival, the Yonhap News
Agency said. Police fired tear gas to break up the protests, but no
arrests or injuries were reported.
   Radical students and dissident leaders want the resignation of
President Roh Tae-woo and withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea. They say the United States supports an authoritarian
government and blocks unification of the two nations.
   The students have received little support because of their
violent tactics.
   In the southwestern city of Kwangju, an autopsy was performed on
the charred body of a man found dead in a pool of paint thinner at
Chosun University. The results of the autopsy were not released.
   Police said they suspected the man, Kim Kyung-chan, 20, had
committed suicide. A friend said Kim was suffering from an
unspecified illness, which might have prompted a suicide.
   Chosun has been hit by violent anti-government protests since a
student leader, Lee Chol-kyu, was found dead at a reservoir near the
city last month.
   Authorities have said Lee drowned after fleeing police but
students have said he may have been tortured. Lee's death touched
off violent street protests in Kwangju.
   Also on Monday, Roh warned that high salary increases and labor
unrest are undermining the economy. He appealed to employers and
workers to show restraint and work together.
   Roh said labor unrest cost the economy $4.5 billion in lost
production so far this year. He said that figure included $1 billion
in lost exports.
   The wages of South Korean workers have risen in the past two
years after years of low salaries that gave its industry a major
price advantage over other Asian exporters.

<HEAD>Solarz Asks More Military Aid for Cambodian Resistance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military aid to non-communist factions in
Cambodia should be increased from the $7 million now planned to as
much as $30 million to help prevent the return to power of the Khmer
Rouge, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., said Monday.
   ``Providing military assistance to non-communist resistance
forces will strengthen the ability of Cambodians wishing to resist
the Khmer Rouge'' after occupying Vietnamese forces are withdrawn in
September, Solarz told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee.
   ``These are Cambodian forces who are willing to put their lives
on the line in order to prevent a repetition of the Khmer Rouge
holocaust,'' Solarz said. ``Don't we have a moral obligation to help
them out?''
   Solarz said he believes the $7 million in military aid sought by
the Bush administration is too little to do the job of strengthening
anti-communist forces.
   ``I would favor giving them more,'' Solarz said. ``This is not a
light or peripheral issue. This is a matter of preventing another
holocaust. For starters, I would provide somewhere between $20
million to $30 million.''
   Robert M. Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
said the administration believes that strengthening the
non-communist resistance, including Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia's former ruler, will help achieve a peaceful political
solution and prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge.
   But other witnesses said they feared that military aid might fall
into the hands of the Khmer Rouge and lead to the restoration of a
regime blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of Cambodians.
   ``I am deeply skeptical of the wisdom of such a policy,'' said
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman. ``I reject
the notion that the best means of dealing with the volatile and
potentially violent situation in Southeast Asia is to inject
military aid.''
   ``Providing military aid would add a potentially explosive
element of instability into the process,'' Cranston said.
   Richard Holbrooke, who was assistant secretary of state for Asian
affairs in the Carter administration, said he also believes that
arming the non-communist forces would be a mistake.
   ``I believe we are headed toward a situation where the Khmer
Rouge will be invited to participate in a coalition government in
Cambodia,'' he said.
   And he said he feared that ``a limited amount of military aid to
an incompetent military force leads us to a later dilemma: Do we
increase that aid or do we continue it at all?''
   But Solarz said that because of the desire to prevent a
repetition of the the killings of the past, ``we are dealing with
one of the transcendental moral issues of our time.''
   He said by providing arms to Sihanouk and the non-communist
resistance, the United States would simultaneously strengthen their
position at the negotiating table.

<HEAD>Reagan Has Accepted Knighthood, Burke's Peerage Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan has been offered an
honorary knighthood and has accepted the highest royal honor Britain
bestows on Americans, Burke's Peerage said Monday.
   Reagan, who is in London on his first visit since leaving the
White House in January, will be the guest of Queen Elizabeth II at a
Buckingham Palace lunch Wednesday, but nobody would say whether she
would give him an award.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
which chronicles the British aristocracy, said: ``We understand it
has been offered and will be accepted either this trip or his next
trip, which is expected to be next spring.''
   Asked whether it was likely to be announced this week, he said:
``I think it's very likely, but we don't know.''
   Buckingham Palace and Reagan's press spokesman, Mark Weinberg,
referred all queries to the Foreign Office, where a spokesman said:
``I simply do not know whether the queen is going to give President
Reagan a knighthood.''
   British honors such as knighthoods are awarded by the queen,
although most are made on the recommendation of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. Buckingham Palace said awards to foreign
officials must be recommended by the Foreign Office.
   Brooks-Baker said Reagan was offered a knighthood ``because
because of his special contribution to the British government under
Mrs. Thatcher. He helped Mrs. Thatcher in the Falklands War and in
many different ways.''
   The United States provided naval intelligence, communications
facilities and political support to Britain during its 1982 war
against Argentina over the Falkland Islands in the south Atlantic.
   Several members of Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party have urged
that Reagan be given a high British honor.
   Lawmaker Harry Greenway said such an honor would be ``not only in
recognition of his unique special relationship with Britain but also
to mark his massive contribution to world peace.''
   If Reagan receives an honorary knighthood, he would be the 57th
American to receive the award, joining his former secretary of
defense, Caspar Weinberger, who was made a knight in 1988; fellow
actors Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Sidney Poitier; President Dwight D.
Eisenhower; and philanthropists Paul Mellon and John Paul Getty II.
   An honorary knighthood wouldn't mean Reagan could call himself
Sir Ronald. That accolade is reserved for the queen's own subjects,
although Brooks-Baker insists there is nothing in U.S. law
preventing Reagan or any other American from using a British title.
   Reagan will deliver a lecture Tuesday on the problems and
challenges confronting the English-speaking world. Afterward, he and
his wife, Nancy, will be guests at a dinner given by Mrs. Thatcher.

<HEAD>U.N. Airlift Brings Namibian Refugees Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations began one of its most
ambitious repatriation operations Monday, bringing hundreds of
Namibian exiles home to participate in the territory's independence
process.
   The first plane arriving at the Windhoek airport from Lusaka,
Zambia, brought about 150 refugees, including adults who have lived
abroad for more than a decade and children who set foot on Namibian
soil for the first time.
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees sought to repatriate more
than 1,300 refugees on 11 flights Monday, but several flights were
canceled after delays and only about 700 refugees returned,
officials said.
   ``They are all in very good health and they are all very happy,''
said Nicolas Bwakira, the U.N. official in charge of the airlift,
who greeted the first batch of returnees.
   The United Nations has registered 41,000 Namibian refugees at
camps in neighboring Angola, Zambia and Botswana. The world body
wants to bring back more than 1,000 refugees a day for the next six
weeks under the independence plan for Africa's last colony, which
has been ruled by South Africa for 74 years.
   In addition to the airlift, hundreds of refugees have crossed the
border from Angola on foot, Namibian officials said.
   The returning refugees were greeted at the airport by about 250
demonstrators wearing the red, blue and green colors of the
South-West Africa People's Organization guerrilla movement.
   SWAPO fought a 23-year bush war with the South African security
forces and now is the most powerful political faction in Namibia.
   The demonstrators included women who sang and men who chanted
pro-SWAPO slogans. They held up signs that pictured SWAPO leader Sam
Nujoma and read, ``Welcome Home SWAPO Freedom Fighters.''
   U.N. troops from Kenya kept the crowd behind ropes as the
refugees went through customs and boarded buses for the 30-mile trip
to the Doebra Refugee Camp outside Windhoek.
   A tent city was built as temporary shelter for the refugees on
the grounds of a Roman Catholic mission. Buses carrying the first
group of refugees were met by about 400 students from the mission
school.
   The students sang and danced outside the compound where the
refugees lined up to receive ration cards and blankets from U.N.
workers.
   U.N. officials have said they expect the refugees to leave the
camp and join relatives within a week.
   Another demonstration took place at a busy highway intersection
at the camp entrance. About 15 members of the Parents Committee of
Namibia held up signs demanding SWAPO account for more than 100
people who joined the organization but have not been heard from.
   ``SWAPO, Where Is My Son?'' said a sign held by a man who added
that his 18-year-old son left to join the organization eight years
ago and has not been heard from since.
   The Parents Committee and other organizations have charged that
SWAPO dissidents were kept prisoner and beaten or executed if they
tried to leave the movement.
   SWAPO has said it released 200 dissidents and denies that it
killed any disenchanted members. SWAPO has said many of the
dissidents were South African spies.
   Under the U.N. independence plan, Namibian elections are set for
November. The polls are to establish a constituent assembly, which
would then set up a black majority government. About 94 percent of
the territory's 1.3 million people are black.
   SWAPO is expected to win the most votes, but it is unclear if
they will be able to capture the two-thirds majority needed to
control the government.
   Under a regional peace treaty signed in December, South Africa
agreed to relinquish control of Namibia in return for Cuba
withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola. The Cubans
fought alongside government forces in their battle against
U.S.-backed rebels.

   The justices said they will review a federal appeals court ruling
that threw out the award on grounds the notes held by the co-op's
investors are not ``securities'' under federal or Arkansas law.
   Sold for many years to thousands of farmers by the co-op, the
notes were uninsured, payable on demand and yielded only interest.
   When the co-op filed for bankruptcy protection in 1984, about
1,600 of its 23,000 members held notes they had purchased for more
than $10 million.
   Among other legal actions, investors filed a ``class action''
lawsuit against Arthur Young &amp; Co., which audited the co-op's 1981
and 1982 financial statements and issued reports on those statements.
   The lawsuit alleged that the accounting firm had fraudulently
misled investors about the co-op's financial strength.
   A federal judge ruled that the notes were securities under state
and federal law, ruled for the investors, and federal jury awarded
the investors about $6.1 million in compensatory damages.
   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year reversed the
award, ruling that the co-op's notes are not securities under
federal or state law.
   The case is Reves vs. Arthur Young &amp; Co., 88-1480.

   A judge convicted an obstetrician of
infanticide Monday for failing to try to keep alive a baby who
witnesses said survived for about 90 minutes after a 1984 abortion
on a 13-year-old.
   The verdict by Common Pleas Judge Lynn Abraham after a 13-week,
non-jury trial was announced without comment or explanation.
   ``I find you guilty as charged of the crime of infanticide,'' she
told 66-year-old Dr. Joseph Melnick.
   It was the first criminal prosecution under Pennsylvania's 1974
abortion law, which requires doctors to do what they can if they
remove a living fetus.
   The law was enacted after the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1973 case
Roe v. Wade found prohibitive abortion laws unconstitutional.
   No sentencing date was set. Melnick, who showed no emotion and
declined to comment, could receive a maximum prison sentence of 3{
to 7 years.
   He originally was charged with murder. But that charge was
dismissed on grounds of insufficient evidence, and the abortion law
was invoked.
   Melnick testified he was told his young patient was in her fourth
month of pregnancy when actually it was the eighth month. State law
prohibits most abortions after six months of pregnancy. He also said
the 3-pound, 9-ounce girl was stillborn.
   But other members of the West Park Hospital staff, where the
abortion was performed, said they detected a heartbeat and claimed
they saw the baby move and gasp.
   ``I don't think he made a mistake,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Andrea Foulkes. ``I think he made a deliberate choice not
to act.''
   Defense attorney Richard Sprague said he would appeal and
suggested the conviction was the product of ``frustration raised
over the abortion issue.''

   Two earthquakes a half-hour apart shook
Southern California on Monday, knocking items off shelves, cracking
the plaster in City Hall, disrupting phone service and prompting
workers to evacuate offices.
   There were no reports of serious damage or injuries.
   A quake measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale struck at 9:57 a.m.
and was followed by a 4.3-magnitude aftershock at 10:25. The quakes
were on the same fault as the Whittier Narrows quake and its
aftershock that killed eight people in 1987.
   ``It was like a ride at Magic Mountain where it just shakes and
shakes,'' said Joseph Libby in Torrance, about 15 miles south of
downtown Los Angeles. ``Some things fell off shelves, like books,
but I can't see any real damage.''
   Their epicenter was about 10 miles southeast of downtown in
Montebello, said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at California Institute
of Technology.
   The quakes, which were felt as far east as Banning, 85 miles from
downtown, temporarily knocked out the Caltech seismology lab's
hotline to the California Department of Emergency Services as well
as other phone lines, Hutton said.
   The quake was classified as moderate, but because it was centered
in the densely populated Los Angeles basin it rattled millions of
people.
   The tremor shook City Hall violently for 12 to 15 seconds,
knocking plaster down. At the nearby Hall of Administration, many of
those attending a Board of Supervisors meeting scurried into the
streets as the jolts sprinkled the room with plaster. Guards ordered
everyone out of the room as a precaution.
   Other downtown buildings also had cracked and falling plaster.
   ``It was like a bouncing feeling,'' said Mavis Lopez, a
receptionist in a 51st-floor office in the Wells Fargo building. ``I
saw people running out of their offices, but everybody knew what it
was and they were relatively calm.''
   At the first jolt, Los Angeles fire trucks pulled out of their
garages and went out patrolling neighborhoods for damage, said
spokesman Greg Acevedo. ``Our helicopters are in the air to check
for damage at the reserviors,'' he said.
   No significant damage was reported in checks with police and
sheriff's stations and firehouses.
   ``Los Angeles building codes are such that 4.5's should not cause
any serious damage,'' Hutton said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage,
5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major''
earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great''
quake, capable of tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3.
   Monday's earthquakes were about six miles west of Whittier, where
a 5.9-magnitude quake struck Oct. 1, 1987, and a 5.3 aftershock Oct.
4 caused $358 million in damage, eight deaths and 200 injuries.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses One Of 10 Perjury Counts Against Swindall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Monday dismissed one of 10 perjury counts
against former Rep. Pat Swindall as the defense began its case.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman called the count ``just
too confusing for a jury trial.''
   The judge also threw out more than half an hour of testimony
Monday by a defense witness, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who
discussed the knowledge that congressmen do and do not have
regarding the details of legislation.
   Swindall was indicted on charges of lying to a federal grand jury
in 1988 about negotiating a loan in 1987 from an agent posing as a
money launderer. Prosecutors said Swindall lied in denying he was
told some of the money might have come from drug trafficking.
   The dismissed charge said Swindall lied when he testified that he
knew little about Gulf Coast Mortgage Corp., the company created by
a Swindall associate to funnel the $850,000 loan to Swindall from
the agent.
   Swindall, if convicted, faces up to five years in prison on each
of the remaining nine counts.
   The defense opened its case Monday by calling Frank, one of at
least three members of Congress subpoenaed by the defense.
   Frank explained that members of Congress have little knowledge of
the nuts-and-bolts of the hundreds of bills Congress considers each
year, unless their specific subcommittees are involved.
   The prosecution has argued that Swindall, a former member of the
House Banking and Judiciary committees, should have been especially
aware of money-laundering laws.
   Frank said ``no human being'' could know the details of ``more
than 20 percent'' of the bills before Congress.
   Frank, a member of the Banking Committee, testified that Swindall
was not a member of the subcommittee that handled the
money-laundering act passed in 1986.
   But he said ``a well-informed member would know we were including
in the drug bill efforts to stop (criminals) from laundering money
and ... getting cute.''
   Freeman said he would order the jury to disregard Frank's
testimony because it could ``open the Pandora's Box'' of matters
protected by the Constitution's clause guarding the ``speech and
debate'' activities of Congress.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat and President Hosni
Mubarak said Monday there is a new ``seriousness'' in the U.S.
position on the Palestinians that could point toward a settlement.
   They also questioned the proposal by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of Israel for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, but said they had not rejected it.
   ``I want to say something about the American position,'' Mubarak
said. ``There is a very big development ... and a very big
improvement in the American position toward the Palestinian issue.
   ``There is a seriousness in the right direction to find a
comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue,'' he said. ``We
have to encourage this direction.''
   He and the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, who
arrived in Cairo earlier Monday, spoke to journalists after a
meeting and working lunch. Their comments also were distributed by
the official Middle East News Agency.
   Both referred to recent statements by President George Bush and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III that Israel must end its
occupation of Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``These are positive statements,'' Arafat said. Like Mubarak, he
praised the Bush administration's ``seriousness'' toward a
settlement in the Middle East.
   Mubarak and Arafat said their questions about the Shamir election
plan include under what law other than Israels the vote might be
conducted, who would be allowed to vote and whether the ballot would
be a first step toward a comprehensive regional peace settlement.
   Shamir says the election's purpose is to choose Palestinians to
negotiate peace. Israel defines the PLO as a terrorist group and
refuses to deal with it.
   Mubarak said Egypt's ``nine or 10'' questions about the plan were
presented Monday by Butros Ghali, minister of state for foreign
affairs, during a visit to Israel, with which Egypt signed a peace
treaty in 1979.
   Arafat said the PLO relayed written questions through the United
States at the third meeting between their representatives last week
in Tunis.
   The PLO has said it will accept election plan only as part of a
comprehensive settlement. Arafat said Monday:
   ``We have not rejected the idea of elections, but we have
specific questions on the subject. Can there be democracy without
freedom? Can there be democracy without self-determination?''
   More than 500 Palestinians have been killed in an uprising that
began 18 months ago in the West Bank and Gaza, and 22 Israelis have
been slain. The PLO and the Arabs want an independent Palestinian
state, which Israel rejects.

   Authorities have effectively snuffed out
the student-led democracy movement in China's largest city through a
campaign of intimidation and arrests, protest supporters said Monday.
   The last symbol of the popular uprising, an 8-foot model of the
Statue of Liberty that had been paraded around the streets last
month, was torn down Monday at the direction of the city government.
   The styrofoam statue stood for the past few weeks at Shanghai's
Fudan University, about 100 yards away from a statue of communist
China's founder, Mao Tse-tung.
   Many protest leaders have gone into hiding or left the city as
authorities sweep through Shanghai, making arrests that are reported
in official media. Students also have reported many arrests.
   Protests in Shanghai continued after Chinese troops broke up
student protests in Beijing on June 3-4. About 3,000 people died in
the capital, most of them students, according to Chinese and Western
diplomatic estimates. The Chinese government says 300 died, most of
them soldiers.
   Martial law has been in effect in Beijing since May 20, but has
not been declared elsewhere in China during the crisis.
   But widespread arrests were reported.
   ``They're arresting students, so all our leaders have run off,''
said a student at Fudan University, which along with Shanghai's
Tongji University is considered the most activist. ``It's all over
for now. But they'll be back.''
   A fellow student said the government frightened students into
going underground. ``As soon as the government makes a serious move
like arresting people, no one dares show his face,'' he said.
   The protests in Shanghai, while large, lacked the fervor of the
emotional demonstrations in Beijing.
   ``After a few marches we don't have the momentum that Beijing
has,'' said a 21-year-old factory worker. ``They're at the center of
government, and that keeps them going.''
   Security authorities have rounded up at least 150 people in
Shanghai in the last three days, mostly workers who took part in
street demonstrations, according to state-run media reports.
   Warnings to students appeared in Shanghai newspapers Monday,
ordering student ``masterminds'' to disband the outlawed Shanghai
independent student union and turn themselves in.
   One of those reported arrested in China's press was identified as
Yao Yongzhan, a Fudan University student who heads an outlawed
student union. A resident of Hong Kong, he was stopped at Shanghai's
airport Sunday when he showed up for a flight to Hong Kong with
several British students and British consulate officials.
   ``We did not know anything about him until he appeared yesterday
morning saying he hadn't gotten enough money,'' a spokesman for the
British Embassy in Beijing said. The consulate in Shanghai loaned
Yao money and gave him a ride to the airport, the spokesman said.
   Police have also cracked down on workers who helped students move
dozens of buses into place last week, creating havoc on Shanghai's
already swollen streets. Eleven leaders of the banned labor union
have been arrested, according to police.
   ``Since the formation of the workers' autonomous union, members
have carried out activities ... opposing the people's government,
disrupting social order, economy and public safety, and destroying
public property,'' the Liberation Daily quoted an unidentified
Shanghai police official as saying.
   On Friday, 50,000 people marched in Shanghai in the largest
protest since the assault in Beijing. Students gave the government
48 hours to begin direct talks with the students on publicizing the
democracy movement and the events in Beijing, and to lower flags in
Shanghai to half-staff.
   But the government ignored the ultimatum, and the students
haven't ventured forth since.
   On Monday night, about 200 workers recruited by the government to
maintain security gathered at the gates of the Tongji campus. They
insisted they were there to keep traffic flowing smoothly.
   They had been in place since 6:00 a.m. Sunday, clearly to prevent
Tongji students from marching out of the school as the 48-hour
deadline aproached.
   Much information about the protests outside of government
channels appears to be coming from Hong Kong, the British colony
scheduled to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Supporters of the movement in Hong Kong regularly send to China
by facsimile machines copies of Hong Kong newspaper stories about
the democracy movement.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Broadens Possible Challenges to Affirmative Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court gave white men significant
new power Monday to challenge court-approved affirmative action
plans, even years after they take effect.
   The 5-4 decision in a case from Birmingham, Ala., represented the
third major civil rights setback in the high court this year for
racial minorities and women.
   Civil rights advocates assailed the ruling, and complained that a
solidified conservative court majority led by former President
Reagan's appointees was reopening old racial wounds.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
white Birmingham firefighters are entitled to their day in court to
try to prove they are victims of reverse racial bias.
   Affirmative action plans agreed to by Birmingham officials, and
approved by court decree in 1981, may be attacked in a new suit by
workers who took no part in the case leading to the original
agreement, Rehnquist said.
   In contrast, the justices killed by a 5-3 vote a
sex-discrimination suit by three women who work at an AT&amp;T plant in
Illinois.
   Relying on a highly technical interpretation of federal civil
rights law, the justices said the women waited too long to claim
that changes in a seniority system discriminated illegally against
them.
   In the Birmingham case, Rehnquist said, ``A judgment or decree
among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them, but it
does not conclude the rights of strangers to those proceedings.''
   He dismissed arguments that permitting white men to reopen
settled affirmative action cases would destroy the incentive for
employers to take steps benefiting women and minorities.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, said the
ruling would ``subject large employers who seek to comply with the
law by remedying past discrimination to a never-ending stream of
litigation and potential liability.''
   Reacting to the decision, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said the
court ``is dealing blow after blow to 25 years of progress in civil
rights law.''
   ``Long-settled cases now have no degree of finality or
certainty,'' Edwards said. ``This decision will open old wounds and
create unfortunate new levels of racial animosity.''
   In a separate case, the court in January ruled that state and
local governments generally may not impose racial quotas for public
works projects. And just a week ago, the court erected new barriers
for minorities seeking to prove with statistics that they are
relegated to lower-paying, less desirable jobs.
   In Monday's decision, Rehnquist was joined by Justices Byron R.
White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
The latter three are Reagan appointees.
   Dissenting with Stevens were Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.
   In a separate 5-4 ruling Monday, White joined with those four
more liberal members to rule that sentencing juries generally may
not be told about the crime victim's personal characteristics.
   The court said a South Carolina murderer unfairly was sentenced
to death after a prosecutor told jurors that the victim was a
religious, community-minded person.
   In other action, the court:
   _Refused to let Montana sheep owners kill grizzly bears
threatening their herds. The court rejected arguments that the
owners have a constitutional right to protect their property, even
if it means killing animals designated an endangered species.
   _Turned away the case of a Marine who died after his wisdom tooth
was pulled. The court left intact a legal doctrine barring members
of the military from suing over injuries suffered ``incident to
service.''
   _Refused to block the extradition to Hong Kong of a California
man accused of falsifying accounts while chairman of a bank in the
British crown colony. The man had argued that his extradition could
subject him to additional prosecution when Hong Kong is returned to
Chinese control in 1997.
   The Birmingham case began in 1974 when city officials and the
Jefferson County Personnel Board were sued by blacks who charged
racial bias in the city fire department.
   Eventually both sides agreed on an extensive plan that included
long-term and interim goals for hiring blacks as firefighters and
promoting blacks to higher ranks. The plan also included provisions
to help women advance.
   The Birmingham Firefighters Association opposed the plan. But its
objections were rejected by a federal judge who issued consent
decrees in 1981 approving the agreement.
   At the time, the city's 453 firefighters included 42 blacks. None
of the department's 140 lieutenants, captains or battalion chiefs
was black.
   Seven white firefighters then challenged the promotion plan,
saying less-qualified blacks were being promoted ahead of them.
   A federal judge, ruling that the white firefighters were bound by
the court consent decree, dismissed their suit. But the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in late 1987 reinstated the suit.
   Monday's ruling does not doom the affirmative action plan, but
forces city and county officials to defend it at a new trial.

<HEAD>US Criticizes China and Deng On Human Rights, Holds Talks On Dissidents</HEAD>

   The State Department on Monday challenged
Chinese assertions that its troops did not fire on pro-democracy
students massed in Tiananmen Square. ``The whole world has seen what
happened,'' said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Seizing the offensive, the department also chastized senior
leader Deng Xiaoping even as the United States pressed efforts to
find a diplomatic solution for two dissidents sheltered in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing and threatened with arrest.
   ``We're trying to resolve it,'' a senior U.S. official said of
the case of Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist critical of the Chinese
government, and his wife, Li Shuxian, an assistant professor at
Beijing University.
   They were accused of counter-revolutionary activities and
warrants for their arrest were issued on Sunday.
   Stepping into the dispute, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
called Han Xu, the Chinese ambassador, to his office Saturday. The
envoy was summoned back Sunday for a talk with Robert Kimmitt, the
undersecretary of state for political affairs, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Reading a statement that reversed days of a deliberately
low-keyed U.S. approach to the tumult in China, the spokeswoman
declared:
   ``The whole world has seen what happened in Tiananmen Square.
Large numbers of peaceful demonstrators were killed by army units.
We condemn the use of live fire against unarmed civilians, which is
what happened in Tiananmen Square.''
   The spokeswoman said the demonstrators were seeking basic human
rights. ``Labeling such people counter-revolutionaries and hooligans
will do nothing to alter the reality of what happened in Tiananmen
Square on June 3,'' she said.
   The Chinese government has said that about 300 people were killed
in the assault and that most were soldiers. Other estimates place
the death toll as high as 3,000.
   Ms. Tutwiler also had sharp words for Deng Xiaoping, China's
senior leader, who emerged from more than three weeks of seclusion
Friday to praise the army's suppression of pro-democracy forces.
   The performance cast doubt on Deng's reputation as a cautious but
ardent advocate of reforming the Marxist system. Ms. Tutwiler said
if Deng ``was responsible for the brutal attack on Tiananmen Square,
then he has acted to undercut the very reform process he has sought
to foster.''
   Baker and Kimmitt, a close aide, were believed in their meetings
with Ambassador Han to be exploring ways to arrange safe passage
from China for Fang, the country's best known dissident, and his
wife. But U.S. officials, concerned about the couple's welfare,
declined to discuss the case.
   Earlier, a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
indicated the United States would not permit Chinese authorities to
arrest the two dissidents.
   ``When a person presents himself to one of our embassies and says
he is imminent danger and we have reason to give it credence
sometimes we grant refuge,'' a U.S. official said. ``And when we do
that, I ask you, `What does it mean?'''
   The charges against the dissidents could amount to accusations of
treason and, amid the turmoil in China, carry the threat of a death
sentence.
   The Beijing government has warned that leaders of independent
groups who refuse to surrender would be arrested ``and dealt with
severely.''
   Meanwhile, the department reported that Chinese police and other
security forces had surrounded the U.S. Embassy in an obvious effort
to keep other dissidents from taking refuge there.
   James Lilley, the U.S. ambassador to China, declined to discuss
the Fang situation in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.
   ``It's too sensitive,'' he said. ``If you get up and start
posturing, it lessens the chance of getting something done.''
   In a separate interview with NBC-TV's ``Today'' program, Lilley
said he hoped the dispute over Fang and Li was ``out of the way
fairly soon.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said when asked
about Fang, ``It's our judgment it's not helpful in any way to
comment.''
   By the latest estimate, one U.S. official said, about 1,100
Americans are still in China. All who wanted to leave are gone or
are on their way out, Ms. Tutwiler said. Over the weekend 159
Americans joined the exodus.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
on Monday proposed ecological cooperation with West Germany that
would include exchanges of technology and emergency assistance in
case of an environmental disaster.
   Speaking at a dinner given by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
Gorbachev said the ``scientific-technical and economic possibilities
of the U.S.S.R. and West Germany would have a huge meaning'' in
Europe's effort to combat pollution.
   Any agreement would more directly benefit the Soviet Union's new
ecology program than the well-established West German effort.
   The Soviets' environmental protection agency was created only
last year and still lacks the finances and many of the powers it
needs to crack down on polluters.
   Soviet officials said last month they were finishing a
comprehensive environmental protection package but they were still
working out technical options for factories to reduce effluence.
   Gorbachev suggested the Soviets and West Germany could conduct
research to develop joint ventures to build pollution control
equipment, process wastes, exchange information between regions and
cities in the two countries, agree on a program of urgent aid in
case of accidents and develop working groups to help form an
all-Europe environmental policy.
   Gorbachev praised the efforts of French President Francois
Mitterrand, and West Germany's opposition Social Democrats and
Greens parties to work out international environmental agreements.
He did not mention Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, which has been
slower to formulate environmental protection policies.
   Thousands of Soviet citizens have participated in demonstrations
protesting decades of rushed industrial production that ignored
environmental consequences.
   Soviet officials have said 50 million people live in cities where
air pollution sometimes exceeds acceptable limits by 10 times and
the country's main waterways are dying because of the dumping of
industrial wastes.
   Environmental activists say overuse of pesticides and chemical
fertilizers are poisoning the food Soviets eat.
   Gorbachev and other government leaders were criticized repeatedly
on the ecology issue by parliamentarians during the Congress of
People's Deputies session that ended Friday.
   Germans are concerned about Soviet environmental policies,
especially after the April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power-plant
disaster. The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant in the
northern Ukraine killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of
radiation that spread around the world.

   A time bomb believed to have been planted
by Sikh militants exploded at the main railroad station Monday,
killing eight people and injuring 53 others, police said.
   The bomb exploded in the station's crowded entrance hall where
hundreds of people were waiting for trains or to buy tickets, police
said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bombing, police said, but
the blast came a week after authorities announced a city-wide alert
against possible terrorist strikes by Sikh extremists around the
fifth anniversary of a bloody army raid on the Sikh Golden Temple in
Amritsar on June 6, 1984.
   The bomb killed seven people at the scene; 54 others were
hospitalized, including a 2{-year-old girl who died from her
injuries, according to police officials speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The girl and her parents were from Karachi, Pakistan, and the
family was waiting to board a train for eastern Calcutta, the
officials said. Her parents were not injured, they said.
   ``We suspect it was the work of the Babbar Khalsa,'' said Police
Commisssioner V.N. Singh. The Babbar Khalsa is one of the
underground militias fighting for an independent Sikh nation in the
northern state of Punjab.
   ``We did suspect this kind of thing,'' Singh said. ``There was
some information from intelligence agencies. There was an alert. But
our arrangements cannot be fool-proof.''
   Singh said whoever planted the bomb could have boarded a train
after dropping the device in the hall.
   Press Trust of India quoted a witness, Pawan Kumar, as saying he
saw a man with a mustache ask someone to look after his briefcase
and a wooden crate while he went to drink water. A few minutes later
the bomb exploded in the same spot, the news agency quoted Kumar as
saying.
   Sandals, sunglasses, and food was strewn across the entrance hall
floor. Blood splattered the hall's 60-foot-high ceiling and a
100-square-foot section of the floor.
   ``It was like hell,'' said Ramesh Kumar, who was in the hall but
escaped injury. ``I thought I was seeing a bad bloody movie.''
   The city's 32,000-member police force was placed on alert. Road
blocks were set up on major roads and vehicles were checked.
   Police made announcements at crowded markets and the capital's
main bus station warning people to stay away from suspicious objects
or unclaimed luggage.
   Sikh militants have been fighting for an independent homeland
since 1982, claiming discrimination by the country's Hindu majority.
They have been blamed in at least 850 killings in Punjab state this
year and for sporadic attacks in the capital in previous years.
   The 1984 raid on the Sikh Golden Temple was aimed at flushing out
armed militants entrenched in the shrine and left at least 1,200
people dead, many of them Sikhs. Less than five months later, Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards in
retaliation.
   The last major Sikh attack in New Delhi occurred on June 20,
1988, when Sikh militants hurled a homemade grenade into a crowded
vegetable market. Four people were killed and more than 40 wounded.

   Columnist Jack Anderson, who pulled out a gun
during an interview with Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole to
illustrate what he termed lax security, was criticized Monday by
fellow journalists who called his ploy ``a cheap shot.''
   Capitol police say they may file criminal charges against
Anderson in connection with the May 24 incident, and the committee
that hands out media credentials is considering revoking Anderson's
privileges.
   ``I think it was a cheap shot,'' Bob Franken of Cable News
Network said about the incident, calling it a ``trivialization'' of
journalism.
   ``The police here do a good job. They have an impossible task,''
Franken said. ``We have some horrendous issues to try to comprehend
here. This was Jack Anderson making a quick buck.''
   Kenan Block, a producer for MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, said in an
interview that he did a similar story on airport security when he
was reporting for a local station.
   ``It's a cheap shot,'' he said. ``It's kind of a cliche. I
thought Anderson would do a more sophisticated story.''
   Al Freeman of Mutual Broadcasting called Anderson's technique ``a
stunt.''
   Freeman said someone such as Anderson, a nationally syndicated
columnist, is known and might have an easier time getting into the
Capitol without as thorough a check as lesser-known individuals.
   Anderson said in a telephone interview Monday that he did not
carry the gun into the building himself because he realized there
was a possibility he would be recongized and therefore not checked
as carefully as a person not known to security officers.
   He said the accomplice who carried the weapon was with the
Anderson party but ``went in far enough ahead of me I don't think
that person would have been associated with me.'' The accomplice was
not named.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Dole,
R-Kan., have threatened to require more time-consuming searches of
the media if the credentials committee doesn't ``deter any future
repetition of this act.''
   Jeffrey Birnbaum, chairman of the five-member panel that oversees
assigning credentials to about 2,000 reporters, said the group would
hold a hearing. No date has been set.
   ``We could do nothing, reprimand him or take away his
credentials,'' Birnbaum said. ``For us, the issue is narrow: Did he
abuse his position as a reporter?''
   Capitol Police Officer Dan Nichols said Anderson could be charged
with possession of a gun inside the Capitol, a felony punishable by
a $5,000 fine, five years in jail or both. Lesser charges also are
being considered, he said.
   ``I think it's sad that once again they would go after the
journalist who exposes a problem instead of correcting the
problem,'' Anderson said in the telephone interview.
   ``I have been told by journalists that their (the authorities')
way of correcting the problem is to double and triple and quadruple
security on journalists. It seems they are punishing all because one
exposed a faulty security system.''
   Anderson addd that the ``publicity probably does me good, but I
would rather avoid it.''
   The incident occurred during taping for his syndicated television
show on which the topic was terrorism.
   Anderson was interviewing Dole in a private office when he pulled
the Austrian-made, part plastic gun out of his pocket, said Dole
spokesman Walt Riker.
   ``Dole was surprised as anyone would be,'' Riker said. ``But the
senator had just made the point that the building is not fail-safe
and that's why we have to be ever vigilant.''
   Nichols said officers have not changed procedures since the
incident.
   ``All visitors have their packages checked and pass through metal
detectors,'' he said.

   Farmers are harvesting a winter wheat crop
estimated at an 11-year low of 1.41 billion bushels, down 10 percent
from last year's harvest and 2 percent below the May forecast, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The new estimate, based on June 1 surveys, compared with last
month's forecast of 1.43 billion bushels and the 1988 winter wheat
harvest of 1.56 billion bushels.
   The next estimate will be July 12.
   Officials said the average yield, based on June 1 conditions, was
estimated at 34.5 bushels per acre, compared with 34.9 bushels per
acre estimated in May and last year's per acre average of 39.2
bushels.
   Farmers are expected to have about 40.8 million acres for harvest
this year, up 3 percent from 39.8 million acres in 1988, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its report.
   ``Once again, we see evidence of a significant shortfall in the
wheat crop on an expanded area,'' said Carl Schwensen, executive
vice president of the National Association of Wheat Growers. ``The
outlook is not likely to improve from this point onward.''
   Winter wheat, planted in the fall and harvested the next summer,
makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat production. The
remainder is planted in the spring.
   Next month's crop report will include production estimates for
spring-planted wheat, thus providing the first 1989 look at total
U.S. wheat output.
   The first estimates of 1989 output of corn, soybeans, cotton and
other major crops will be issued Aug. 10.
   Lingering drought and late-season freezes crippled much of the
winter wheat crop in parts of the Great Plains, notably in Kansas
where this year's harvest was estimated at 202.4 million bushels.
That was unchanged from May indications, but far below last year's
harvest of 323 million bushels.
   The continuing effects of drought in Kansas and some other states
have stirred demands for federal aid comparable to the $3.9 billion
emergency measure passed by Congress last year to help cover 1988
losses.
   Legislation has been introduced to expand 1989 drought
assistance, but the administration has opposed any massive
rapid-fire remedies until more is known about the crop situation.
   Schwensen said the June winter wheat report ``highlights once
again the need for federal disaster legislation.''
   The skimpy wheat outlook is not expected to have a major impact
on the price of bread or other food products, according to USDA
economists.
   Overall, they expect consumer food prices to increase an average
of 5 percent to 7 percent in 1989, compared with last year's average
gain of 4.1 percent. Higher vegetable prices stemming from severe
winter cold and lingering effects of last year's drought are major
factors.
   In a related supply-and-demand report, USDA projected total 1989
wheat production _ a figure based on assumptions of normal weather
and trend yields _ at about 2.03 billion bushels, up from last
year's 1.81 billion bushels. That was down slightly from the May
projection.
   The report showed that wheat prices could rise to an average of
$3.80 per bushel to $4.20 per bushel in 1989-90, from $3.74 per
bushel in the wheat marketing year that ended May 31.
   With higher prices ahead, wheat exports could decline to 1.15
billion bushels, from 1.44 billion bushels in 1988-89, the report
said. The U.S. wheat stockpile June 1, 1990, would be down to about
500 million bushels from 616 million bushels on hand this June 1.

<HEAD>Three Republicans Vie Tuesday To Oppose Wilder for Virginia Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Republicans scrambled from the
mountains to the coast on the eve of a primary Tuesday to decide who
will oppose Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder in his bid to become the
nation's first elected black governor.
   Former U.S. Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr., former Attorney General J.
Marshall Coleman and U.S. Rep. Stanford E. Parris looked for a
last-minute edge in the tight race in Virginia's first GOP
gubernatorial primary in 40 years.
   Meanwhile, Wilder and his running mates opened a get-acquainted
tour of the state just two days after winning the Democratic
nomination.
   Trible, 42, had led all polls until last week. But two surveys
published as Coleman turned 47 on Thursday put him about even with
Trible. Parris, 59, was was close enough to the leaders to fall
within the polls' sampling errors.
   A poll released last week showed each of the three GOP contenders
leading Wilder, but only slightly. Wilder is nurturing his image as
an underdog, a tactic which helped parlay him into the lieutenant
governorship in 1985.
   The nation has not had a black governor since Reconstruction and
has never actually elected one. Lt. Gov. Pinckney Pinchback of
Louisiana became acting governor in 1872-73 after Gov. Henry
Warmouth was removed from office.
   Because voter rolls do not designate party, all of the state's
2.6 million registered voters are eligible to cast ballots in
Tuesday's primary, but few are predicting a big turnout of
Republicans, much less Democrats.
   Susan Fitz-Hugh, secretary of the Board of Elections, predicted
that turnout could be as low as 250,000, or less than 10 percent.
   But Parris and a top Trible aide, Judy Peachee, said they
expected as many as 350,000 to vote.
   Wilder has played down the racial aspect of the contest, as have
the GOP contenders. Political experts have said Wilder has at least
an even chance of winning in Virginia, which is 82 percent white.
   Wilder was elected in 1985 on the same ticket as Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles, who is barred by the state constitution from seeking a
second consecutive term.
   The three GOP candidates have raised almost $10 million for the
primary, which Republican leaders chose instead of a convention in a
bid to recapture the Executive Mansion that has been the home of
Democrats since 1982.
   Trible, speaking Monday during the busy lunch hour in Richmond's
downtown financial district, continued to press an electability
message. He said a Coleman or Parris win in the primary would give
the Nov. 7 election to Wilder.
   Parris, meantime, said the forecast for rain probably would work
to his advantage, since bad weather tends to hurt turnout in rural
areas where he is weakest. ``We think we're peaking at exactly the
right time,'' he said.
   Coleman was endorsed Monday by the Washington Times, which cited
his ``more aggressive and specific advocacy of reforms in welfare,
education and criminal justice.''
   Wilder, 58, was nominated for governor Saturday at a harmonious
state Democratic convention.
   Asked which Republican he would prefer to face, Wilder said he
would take on any of them and that he would not encourage his
supporters to vote in the GOP primary.
   Wilder, a grandson of slaves who grew up in segregated Richmond
and attended Howard University Law School in Washington on a state
stipend because he could not go to Virginia's all-white law schools,
has portrayed himself as a social moderate and fiscal conservative.
   The Wilder nomination ``is giving Virginians an opportunity to
put the era of racial discrimination behind them,'' said Tom Morris,
a University of Richmond political scientist.

   Hundreds of Arabs
lined up Monday to collect army-issued computerized identity cards
despite a call by underground Palestinian leaders to fight their
distribution.
   Some Palestinians claimed soldiers coerced them to accept the new
cards and others said they would be denied jobs without them.
   Residents of the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip are barred from
entering Israel without the cards that are designed to increase
control of their movements. Government officials said the system may
be expanded to also cover the occupied West Bank.
   The daily Haaretz newspaper reported Monday that the army plans
to extend from six months to one year the maximum period imprisoned
Arab can be held without trial. The change is part of a legal
crackdown on the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied lands, the paper said.
   An army spokesman refused to comment on the report.
   There are now 1,508 Arabs being held under Israel's
``administrative detention'' procedures, according to official
reports. The United States and international human rights groups
condemn the practice as a violation of due process of the law.
   Army gunfire wounded six Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip on Monday, including two 14-year-old boys, Arab hospital
officials said.
   At least 516 Palestinians have been killed and more than 10,000
wounded since the uprising began in December 1987. Twenty-two
Israelis also have been slain in the violence.
   At a military base at this crossing into the Gaza Strip,
Palestinians sat in long rows in a building, waiting to get the new
identity cards.
   The red, green and white plastic cards are being issued only to
Gaza men over the age of 16 who have paid all their taxes and do not
have criminal records, the army said.
   Col. Ami Levy, who is directing the distribution, said cards will
be denied to Palestinians who have served more than five months of
administrative detention.
   He estimated that 2,000 Arabs would be denied cards.
   ``It's an honesty card,'' said Levy. ``Everyone who has one is
regarded as cleared by the administration to work and visit in
Israel.''
   In a leaflet distributed Sunday, the clandestine leadership of
the Palestinian uprising accused Israeli authorities of ``renewing
their Nazi and fascist activities'' with the cards and said the
effort would be opposed.
   The army began issuing the cards last week, Levy said. Arabs must
pay 20 shekels ($11) for each card.
   The cards are critical for the estimated 50,000 Gazans who work
in Israel.
   Atef, a Palestinian in his 30s who would give only that name,
said soldiers forced him to come to the base, but he acknowledged he
needed the card to work in Israel.

<HEAD>Polygamy Shouldn't Bar Utah Couple From Adoption, High Court Told</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: First name Sharane in 2nd graf is cq.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEG McENTEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple's practice of polygamy is no
reason to bar them from adopting six motherless children, a lawyer
told Utah's Supreme Court on Monday.
   The judge should have considered Vaughn and Sharane Fischer's
other qualifications as parents and the interests of the children,
who have lived with them two years, said attorney David Nuffer,
representing the Fischers.
   But Timothy Anderson, representing relatives who oppose the
adoption, called plural marriage ``anathema to society.''
   Oral arguments before the state's highest court took place in a
courtroom overflowing with friends and relatives.
   The Fischers sought to adopt the children, ages 5 to 19, after
the 1987 cancer death of their mother, Brenda Thornton, who married
Fischer, 54, three months before her death and assigned custody to
his family with consent from the children's biological father.
   Circuit Judge Dean E. Conder ruled in December that while the
Department of Social Services found the couple capable, their
polygamist lifestyle disqualified them. The judge stayed his
decision pending an appeal.
   The children remain in the polygamist town of Hildale near the
Arizona border with the Fischers, who share their home with plural
wife Katarina Stubbs and 15 children.
   ``The question of what is best for the children is central to the
issue,'' Nuffer said. Further, he said, Ms. Thornton's marriage to
Fischer was based on ``her specific desire and purpose ... to bring
her children into the family.''
   Anderson countered that polygamy was ended for good reason in the
19th century because it ran counter to society's commitment to
monogamy.
   The Mormon Church dropped polygamy as a tenet of its faith in
1890 in exchange for statehood and it is proscribed in the Utah
Constitution.
   However, an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Mormons still practice
plural marriage at risk of excommuncation.
   The law against polygamy has not been actively enforced for more
than three decades.
   Anderson said said the case hinges not on the Fischers' right to
their fundamentalist Mormon beliefs but on the state's
responsibility to protect children from being taught illegal
practices.
   Ms. Thornton's stepsister, Pat Johanson of Washington, claims
that transfer of the children to the Fischers was signed under
pressure from the fundamentalists and that Ms. Thornton really
wanted her to take the children.
   Ms. Johanson said her stepsister confided her true wishes in the
weeks before her death but feared being excommunicated.
   Ms. Johanson's sister, Janet Johanson of Salem, Ore., is seeking
to adopt the children.

<HEAD>Study Finds Presence of Nicotine Derivative in Nearly All Non-Smokers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN F. BONFATTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study has found that nearly all
non-smokers have traces of a nicotine derivative in their systems,
most of them from exposdure to smoke at work and in public places,
scientists said Monday.
   That indicates restrictions on public smoking can reduce the
threat of smoke to non-smokers, they said.
   Nearly all the 663 non-smokers in the 1986 study had traces of a
nicotine derivative in their urine, said researchers at Roswell Park
Memorial Institute.
   ``This means they had had a recent exposure to tobacco smoke,''
said Dr. K. Michael Cummings, who conducted the study. ``What that
means is exposure to tobacco smoke among non-smokers, at least in
the western New York area, is ubiquitous.''
   The percentage of smokers in the Buffalo area is about the
national average, meaning the study's findings should be reflective
of the country as a whole, Cummings said.
   Studies have linked ``passive'' smoke exposure to a wide range of
health problems, including eye and nose irritation, respiratory
infections in infants and children and increased risks of heart
disease and cancer.
   Cummings said 91 percent of the Buffalo-area non-smokers
interviewed over a year had traces of cotinine, a breakdown product
of nicotine, in their urine.
   What surprised researchers is that only 76 percent of the
non-smokers reported they had been exposed to tobacco smoke in the
four days previous to the study.
   ``Even among those individuals who did not live with a smoker ...
84 percent had evidence of cotinine in their urine, which was
indicative of exposures probably occurring outside the home,''
Cummings said.
   In the study, researchers interviewed non-smoking volunteers who
had gone to Roswell Park as part of a cancer screening clinic.
   Combining the 28 percent who said their exposure to smoke came at
work with the 16 those who said their exposure came in restaurants
and 8 percent in public buildings, Cummings said more than half of
the reported exposures occurred in areas where non-smokers don't
have the option of avoiding the exposure.
   ``These findings suggest that policies regulating smoking in
public places could have a significant impact on reducing a person's
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke,'' said Cummings.

<HEAD>Commerce Withdraws Nuke Export License to China</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department withdrew an export
license for the sale of $500 million in nuclear power plant parts to
China after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Sen. John Glenn
protested, officials said Monday.
   ``We viewed it initially as an attempt to circumvent the law,''
said Leonard Weiss, staff director of the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs. ``We discovered the State Department wasn't
even aware of this export.''
   Glenn, chairman of the committee, complained in a letter to
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher that the shipment would
undercut a 1985 congressional resolution forbidding such sales
unless the president certified that China is not helping other
nations build nuclear weapons.
   The Ohio Democrat has been a frequent critic of what he calls
China's clandestine trade in nuclear-related materials with Third
World countries, particularly Pakistan and nations in the Middle
East.
   All of the equipment _ non-reactor items such as compressors,
pipes, turbine generators and other electrical gear _ was from a
canceled power plant at Satsop, Wash. The plant belongs to the
Washington Public Power Supply System, a consortium of publicly
owned local utilities.
   All of the licensing events occurred in May, before the Chinese
government's crackdown on student demonstrators in Beijing.
   WPPSS spokesman Gary Petersen said the consortium still wants to
sell the equipment to China.
   ``We knew all this unrest in China would delay things,'' Petersen
said. ``But it doesn't stop it.''
   WPPSS also sought licenses from the NRC and the State Department
to sell the plant's reactor and 250,000 pounds of enriched uranium
fuel to China.
   The NRC rejected those requests earlier this year because neither
President Bush nor President Reagan had certified that China is
abiding by nuclear non-proliferation safeguards.
   While the NRC is in charge of issuing export licenses for
reactors and nuclear fuel, the Commerce Deparment has export
licensing authority for all non-nuclear electric power plant
components.
   However, such licenses normally are not approved by either until
after interagency consultations among the NRC, the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency and the State, Commerce and Energy
departments.
   Because the non-nuclear components are so coupled with the
particular model of reactor at the WPPSS plant, the export licenses
for each make sense only if they are coordinated, said Harold
Denton, director of the NRC's office of governmental and public
affairs.
   He said the Commerce Department license was issued in early May
``without consulting with us.'' It was withdrawn two weeks later
when the NRC found out about it.
   ``It sounds to me like it was an oversight on their part, because
normally they do consult with us,'' Denton said about the Commerce
Department. ``In this case, they didn't. But they've corrected
that.''
   The Commerce Department has agreed to condition any license for
the export of non-nuclear components to NRC approval of the reactor
sale.
   Weiss said Commerce Deparment officials originally contended that
a non-proliferation declaration from Bush was not needed because the
license was only for non-nuclear components. However, Weiss said,
Mosbacher later told Glenn that the deal was being deferred until
after consultations with the NRC.
   A Commerce official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the department had no basis for denying the license because the
export was general, non-nuclear industrial equipment.
   ``The NRC and the State Department both had action on this and
none of it was going to go forward unless all three approved,'' said
the official. ``And we knew it was highly unlikely that the NRC was
going to approve it.''

<HEAD>Monk's Tale of Seeing American POWs in Vietnam Sent to Washington</HEAD>

   A Japanese monk's account of recently sharing a room
with American war prisoners in Vietnam is being sent to Washington
for analysis, U.S. Embassy spokesman Karl Olsson said Monday.
   A Vietnamese Embassy official called the account ``an absolute
lie.''
   Details of Buddhist monk Iwanobu Yoshida's account were gathered
in meetings Sunday of a representative of the U.S. defense attache's
office in Tokyo and Yoshida, who was freed in January after 14 years
in a Vietnamese re-education camp, Olsson and Yoshida's daughter
said.
   Olsson said the content of the meetings was being sent to
Washington for analysis, but refused to say what was discussed or
how long the sessions ran.
   Yoshida is undergoing hospital treatment for mental disorders and
a speech impediment and only his daughter, Keiko Takatsuka, can
understand what he says, a hospital spokesman said.
   The U.S. official met Yoshida on Sunday morning and evening at
the hospital in Sapporo on Japan's northernmost main island of
Hokkaido, Ms. Takatsuka said.
   In the past week, Japanese press reports and Ms. Takatsuka have
said Yoshida saw up to 10 Americans in the Vietnamese camp and
shared a cell with three.
   Ms. Takatsuka said her father does not remember the names of
those in his cell, but described them as ``young and healthy.''
   ``My father's memory is still not clear, though it is improving
as he continues to answer questions about his experiences,'' she
told The Associated Press.
   The meetings Sunday were kept short because of Yoshida's
condition and together lasted less than an hour, she said by
telephone from her home in Sapporo.
   Ms. Takatsuka said her father reiterated in the meetings that he
shared a room with Americans in the camp and had nothing new to add.
She said a doctor and an embassy interpreter were present.
   ``He doesn't want to meet anyone, and has asked me to tell his
story for him,'' she said. She refuses to allow reporters to meet
Yoshida.
   Citing his poor health, Ms. Takatsuka turned down earlier
American requests to interview her father, said a U.S. Embassy
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The story is an absolute lie,'' said the Vietnamese Embassy
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There are no living
prisoners of war in Vietnam, and Yoshida's and his daughter's
stories just don't add up.''
   The United States has pressed Hanoi for years for a better
accounting of the 1,730 Americans still listed as missing in action
in Vietnam and 634 missing elsewhere in the war zone.
   After becoming a monk in 1966, Yoshida emigrated to Vietnam and
set up a temple in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. He became a South
Vietnamese citizen in 1973.
   He was arrested in 1975 after communist forces took over South
Vietnam. On Jan. 20, Vietnam released him for humanitarian reasons
after appeals were filed by international human rights groups,
including Amnesty International.

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov visited Uzbekistan
Monday and an airlift began evacuating 17,000 Meshki Turks after a
week of ethnic violence in which some 100 people have been killed,
Soviet media reported.
   Rioting has centered in Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley. Most of
those slain were Meshki Turks, an ethnic minority of 300,000 people
moved to Soviet Central Asia during World War II from Georgia, near
Turkey. The Turks have appealed repeatedly for permission to return
to Georgia. Dictator Josef Stalin ordered their transfer in 1944.
   Government officials have blamed mobs of Uzbeks for most of the
violence.
   No violence was reported Monday, but ``there are a lot of rumors
that arouse panic and concern,'' said Vremya, the evening television
news program.
   It showed Ryzhkov with former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov, now
the top Communist Party law-and-order official, and Interior
Minister Vadim Bakatin touring a state farm devastated by an arson
fire that left dozens of people homeless.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the Kremlin delegation was
sent to ``review on the spot questions about the normalization of
the situation.''
   People paused Monday to bury the dead for the first time since
the violence began in the valley, a cotton- and grape-growing region
1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, Vremya reported.
   It said armed guards accompanied bus convoys of refugees, most of
them Meskhi Turks, to an airport near Fergana city for evacuation to
central Russia. Vremya gave the figure of 17,000 being evacuated and
said some flights were delayed because many people lost their
documents in the rioting.
   On Sunday, Vremya quoted a Meskhi spokesman as demanding
immediate evacuation to ``save our lives.''
   A curfew imposed June 4 remained in force but all industrial
complexes except chemical plants were operating, Vremya said.
   Trouble was reported over the weekend in Namangan, another city
in Uzbekistan. Tass said more than 300 men marched to the railway
station and stoned police, riots erupted in other parts of the city
and 28 people were arrested.
   Security was reinforced around ``important projects,'' but the
situation in Namangan was under control, the agency said.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said an armed mob tried to
storm a refugee camp over the weekend where Meshki had sought
safety, but soldiers taken in by helicopter drove the attackers off,
killing two.
   A soldier killed an attacker who tried to grab his gun Sunday in
Margilan and a patrol killed one motorcyclist and injured another
when they fired a sawed-off shotgun in the city of Kokand, Tass said.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said soldiers killed an
attacker and wounded one Saturday in Kokand and, in Margilan, killed
a driver who refused to stop.
   On Monday, a telephone operator said no calls could be put
through to Fergana because of the disturbances.
   At least 1,000 people have been injured in the week of violence,
according to the media reports. The military newspaper Red Star said
136 Interior Ministry soldiers had been hurt.
   More than 9,000 Interior Ministry troopers sent into the region
have been unable to halt attacks by armed gangs of marauders,
officials said.
   The last time Soviet soldiers reportedly fired on civilians was
during a clash with pro-independence protesters in Georgia on April
9. It was reported that 20 people were slain. Georgian activists
said the protesters were unarmed.
   Government officials have said the Uzbek mobs have automatic
weapons, firebombs and pitchforks.
   An account Monday in Pravda said ``gangs of bandits, not even
masquerading any more under the guise of `nationalist zealots,' are
continuing to maraud, rob, burn and murder, not caring which
nation's property'' they pillage.
   Rioters have set fire to hundreds of homes and other buildings.
   Sunday night, state television showed some of an estimated 14,500
Meskhi Turks at one refugee camp crowded into canvas tents.

   China has purchased another 100,000 metric tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began
June 1, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The latest sale boosted to more than 2.75 million tons the amount
of U.S. wheat that China has purchased for 1989-90 delivery. Last
year's sales totaled 8.3 million tons, making China the leading
foreign market for American wheat farmers.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon notified Congress on Monday that
the Bush administration has approved the sale of more powerful jet
engines to replace the originals on F-15 jet fighters flown by Saudi
Arabia.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon said
the Saudis would be offered the upgraded engines along with support
equipment and spare parts at an estimated cost of $350 million.
   The Saudis have purchased 74 of the twin-engine F-15 Eagles from
the United States.
   The Defense Department said the change would make it easier for
the Saudis to continue purchasing support services for their F-15's,
since the same conversion has been made in the U.S. Air Force F-15
fighters.
   ``The sale of this equipment and support will not affect the
basic military balance in the region,'' the Pentagon said. ``The
modification offers reliability and maintainability improvements
with some increase in engine performance.''
   The Air Force will be responsible for overseeing the transaction
and the Pratt &amp; Whitney Division of the United Technologies Corp.
will be the prime contractor.

<HEAD>USDA Says Extra 2.46 Million Acres to Be Taken From Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers have contracted with the government to
take an additional 2.46 million acres of highly erodible cropland
from production under the 10-year Conservation Reserve Program, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The additional acres were enrolled during the program's eighth
round of sign-ups held Feb. 6-24. The next will be July 17 through
Aug. 4.
   Keith Bjerke, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said the total contracted
under the CRP is nearly 30.6 million acres.
   Bjerke said the total now exceeds the 28.7 million acres that was
in the 1960 Soil Bank program, making the CRP ``the largest
long-term cropland retirement program in U.S. history.''
   Under the program, farmers agree to take their land from
production for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit,
farmers who are accepted get annual rental payments from the
government and one-time assistance to pay for half the cost of
planting trees, shrubs and grass to guard against erosion.
   Average annual rental payments have been running close to $50 per
acre.
   The goal set by Congress in the 1985 farm law is to have 40
million to 45 million acres in the program by 1990.
   Here are the CRP acreages by state, with total program acreages
in the first column and the acreages from the eighth sign-up in the
second column:

   The Pentagon office that oversees Star Wars
research said Monday it had signed an agreement with Britain's
Ministry of Defense to launch a joint computer project.
   The work, valued at an estimated $26 million over the next 4 {
years, will involve development and demonstration of so-called
``knowledge-based computer systems,'' the Pentagon said.
   Knowledge-based software programs are capable of ``learning'' and
expanding their own capabilities as new information is added to the
original programmed data. The work with Britain will focus on how
such computer systems might help operate a defensive system against
battlefield or naval missiles.
   ``For example, software intended to facilitate identification of
a particular type of missile body from its (rocket) plume signature
could `learn' to accomplish the same task for different types of
missiles given only the new plume signature data,'' the Pentagon
said.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the Pentagon's
Star Wars office, said the British had agreed to pick up 58 percent
of the project's cost and the United States would pick up the
remaining 42 percent.

<HEAD>Gregg Said Not to be Grand Jury Target</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donald Gregg, whose nomination as ambassador to
South Korea has been stalled by a lengthy Senate probe, is not the
target of a federal perjury investigation, according to the State
Department's chief legal adviser.
   The official, Abraham D. Sofaer, said in a letter to Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, that Gregg received that assurance from the office of
Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh. The letter was made available
Monday.
   ``The administration has no interest is appointing as ambassadors
individuals who are the targets of grand jury investigations,''
Sofaer told Pell. ``Mr. Gregg would withdraw from consideration if
his conduct was so regarded by a federal prosecutor. This has never
been the case, however, and it is not so today.''
   Sofaer said Gregg was told that he is a ``subject'' of the
Iran-Contra investigation being conducted by Walsh but is ``not a
target.''
   The United States Attorney's manual describes a subject as ``a
person whose conduct is within the scope of a grand jury's
investigation,'' Sofaer said.
   A ``target'' is described as a ``person to whom a prosecutor or
the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him-her to the
commission of a crime.''
   ``Under longstanding practice, a `target' who is a witness before
a grand jury is warned that his `conduct is being investigated for
possible violations of federal criminal law,''' Sofaer said.
   ``When Mr. Gregg testified before the grand jury he was informed
that he was not a target, and was not told that his conduct was
being investigated for possible violation of federal criminal law,''
he said.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigation against
Gregg is focused on allegations that while serving as Vice President
Bush's national security adviser in the Reagan administration Gregg
helped in illegal resupply of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who has spearheaded the committee's
investigation of Gregg, has said he finds Gregg's firm denials of
such activity ``hard to accept.''
   Speculation that the grand jury might be preparing to indict
Gregg for perjury stemmed from Walsh's noncommittal reply when asked
by Cranston whether Gregg was a target of the Iran-Contra probe.
   In that reply, dated June 1, Walsh said it is accurate that the
investigation ``extends to perjury and false statements before the
Iran-Contra hearings'' as evidenced by the indictment of retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   Walsh said his office had made no statement about Gregg, was
``unable to comment further at this time'' and ``cannot be helpful
on the question of scheduling.''
   Under an agreement between Cranston and Republican members of the
committee, Gregg will be questioned under oath at a second
investigative hearing on Thursday. Cranston has said he will permit
the full committee to vote on the Gregg nomination on June 20.

<HEAD>Storms Rumble From Texas To Ohio Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms were scattered from Texas and the southern Plains
into the Ohio Valley on Monday, unleashing at least one tornado in
Kentucky, and thunderstorms also developed in Minnesota, Colorado
and Florida.
   An upper air disturbance moving across warm, humid, very unstable
air triggered strong thunderstorms across the lower Mississippi
Valley. Wind gusted to 60 mph at Charleston, Ark., and wind downed
trees and power lines at Lamar, Ark.
   Strong thunderstorms also developed over the lower Ohio Valley. A
tornado touched down near Simpsonville, Ky., but there were no
reports of injury or damage, state police said. High wind elsewhere
in Kentucky toppled trees at Calhoun and near Reynolds Station, the
National Weather Service said.
   Thunderstorms across southern Oklahoma dropped hail near Taylor.
Almost the entire state was under a flash flood watch Monday night
because the ground was already saturated after more than a week of
rain.
   ``Most of the rivers in the state are running at close to bank
full,'' said Ken Huckabee, a weather service forecaster in Norman.
   Since June 1, Oklahoma City has had 8.85 inches of rain. Similar
or higher figures have been reported around the state, which
normally has less than half that amount for the entire month of June.
   Central and eastern Texas had thunderstorms with locally heavy
rain.
   Heavier rain during the six hours up to 1 p.m. CDT included 1.42
inches at Fort Worth, Texas; 1.18 at West Plains, Mo., and 1.00 at
Dallas.
   Farther north, thunderstorms developed over Minnesota along a
cold front that stretched from the upper Mississippi Valley to
southern Colorado, which also had scattered thunderstorms.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms were scattered across the Florida
Peninsula and showers were scattered from the upper Great Lakes to
the upper Ohio Valley.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Grand Marais, Minn., to 99 at Palm Springs, Calif.
Monday's low in the 48 contiguous states was 33 degrees at West
Yellowstone, Mont., and Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   For Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from much of
the northern and middle Atlantic Coast across the Appalachians, the
Great Lakes, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the lower
Mississippi Valley into the southern Plains. Scattered showers were
expected across the upper Mississippi Valley and the Dakotas.
Scattered thunderstorms were forecast across Florida, and central
and eastern Colorado.
   Highs in the upper 50s or 60s were predicted from much of the
northern and central Plains across the upper Mississippi Valley and
the upper Great Lakes to much of New England; in the 60s and 70s
along the Pacific Coast; in the 90s from the southern Atlantic Coast
and Florida across the Gulf Coast region, the southern half of
Texas, inland California and much of Nevada; above 100 over the
desert Southwest, inland valleys of southern California and sections
of south-central and southwestern Texas; and in the 70s and 80s over
the remainder of the nation.

   President Bush won strong praise Monday for his
legislative proposal to reduce air pollution but lawmakers and
special-interest groups said tough bargaining remains over cutting
motor vehicle emissions and controlling airborne toxic chemicals.
   General support from industry, environmental organizations and
lawmakers on all sides of the issue centered on Bush's willingness
to put a strong proposal on the table after eight years of inaction
by the Reagan administration.
   But when pressed for their detailed views, these organizations
and lawmakers differed over crucial technical points that eventually
will decide whether a decade-long congressional logjam over clean
air can be broken.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in an Ottawa
statement that he Bush proposal was the most positive move by the
United States in a decade of Canadian complaints and requests for
action.
   Canada which blames half its acid rain on pullution flowing in
from the United States.
   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said at a news conference,
``I am advised the controls ... would satisfy Canada's request for a
50 percent reduction in acid rain reaching this country.'' He said
Canada still hopes for a treaty to make the new controls harder to
weaken.
   The most negative comments came from coal interests.
   Richard L. Lawson, president of the National Coal Association,
accused Bush of trying ``to accomplish too much, too soon,'' called
some provisions ``unnecessary, unduly harsh and economically
onerous'' and warned that ``electric rate payers will likely pay
more for electricity.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who represents a coal-producing
state, said Bush's plan to cut acid rain unfairly penalizes the
high-sulfur coal areas, abandons the promise of clean-coal
technology and endangers the nation's energy future.
   ``The proposal, by leading to massive switching from high-sulfur
to low-sulfur coal, will serve as a disincentive to the use of
clean-coal technologies,'' Byrd said.
   But more typical were comments by an auto industry spokesman, Tim
MacCarthy, who said Bush ``has really shown leadership,'' and Rep.
Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee, who applauded ``the president's commitment
to deal effectively with ... urban air pollution, acid rain, and air
toxics.''
   ``This is a long journey beginning with a single step,'' said
Rep. Edward R. Madigan of Illinois, ranking Republican on Waxman's
subcommittee. Jerry Jasinowski, executive vice president of the
National Association of Manufacturers, pronounced the organization
``pleased that the president recognizes the value of allowing
businesswide flexibility.''
   A crucial message of support came from House Energy and Commerce
Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., known for his protection of the
auto industry's interests on clean air.
   ``The broad outlines appear reasonable, effective and consistent
with the need to promote economic growth and job opportunities,'' he
said.
   Demonstrating how the harmony breaks down when specifics are
discussed, Waxman said Bush wasn't tough enough on reduction of
motor vehicle emissions, adding: ``Without tough new controls on
cars, trucks and buses, we simply won't get clean air.''
   MacCarthy, director of federal liaison of the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Assocation, said ``We don't support tailpipe emissions
standards.''
   However, MacCarthy, in a statement that could increase chances of
eventual approval of clean air legislation, said, ``There are never
100 percent victories in this town (Washington).'' He added ``there
is a very good likelihood there will be some tightening of tailpipe
standards.''
   David Hawkins, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group, said Bush left unclear whether he would require
use of the best possible technology to reduce the largely
unregulated release of airborne toxic chemicals.
   David Gardiner, of the Sierra Club, called the air toxics part of
the bill ``the weakest'' portion. He added that the standard that
would be imposed on industry ``will not make a dent'' in the problem.
   But Gardiner, legislative director of the Sierra Club, said that
overall, Bush ``laid out a set of objectives that are worthy and
will definitely break the logjam. The reason there was no action the
last eight years was the failure of Reagan to put a proposal on the
table.''
   He called Bush's acid rain proposal a strong one but said he's
skeptical about a provision to allow large utilities to trade or
sell credits for sulfur dioxide reductions if they exceed the
minimum reduction requirements.
   ``In theory it should work,'' Gardiner said, but added that in
practice, the trades or sales could result in an imbalance, where
there are major reductions in one region and few in another.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chief sponsor of clean air legislation
in the Senate, said, ``The rhetoric is good, but it's a bit vague in
the urban smog provisions.''
   He praised an ``attitude change'' in the White House because Bush
``is committed to a bill, which was not the case'' during Ronald
Reagan's presidency. ``But the actual language is going to tell
where the president is. All interests are much more inclined to
compromise,'' Baucus said.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, last year's
chief clean air legislative sponsor, called Bush's statement ``a
significant departure from the negative environmental policy of the
Reagan administration, which opposed every clean-air bill considered
by Congress for the past eight years.''
   He said the government ``must be prepared to deal fairly and
humanely'' with the job loss that the proposal is likely to produce.
   Mitchell said he is concerned that the president did not say how
the proposed reductions would be made, adding, ``the history of the
Clean Air Act demonstrates clearly that merely setting forth goals
is not sufficient to achieve them.''

   Prime Minister Charles Haughey seems
destined to win a fifth term, but polls indicate a parliamentary
majority may escape him again.
   Haughey called Thursday's election after a defeat in the Dail, or
parliament, where his major policies have been supported by the main
opposition parties.
   A poll published Monday by The Irish Times showed Haughey's
Fianna Fail party with 47 percent support, down from 50 percent in
late May. Another, for the Sunday Independent, showed 45 percent
supporting Fianna Fail, a drop of 2 percent within a week.
   Margins of error were 3 percent.
   ``The polls are giving very confused signals. As I read the polls
there is a slow, strong swing toward Fianna Fail in the closing
stage of this campaign,'' Haughey told a news conference Monday.
   In Dublin betting shops, however, Haughey's chances to return as
Taoiseach, or prime minister, slipped to 7-1 from a 10-1 favorite,
and the odds on Fianna Fail winning a majority went from 4-1 for to
6-4 against.
   A poll conducted in May for The Irish Times found 93 percent of
those questioned rated unemployment a ``very important'' issue.
Other rated issues were cuts in government health programs, 82
percent; emigration, 76 percent; and poverty, 70 percent.
   Haughey, 63, called the election May 25 following his
government's sixth defeat in the Dail since it took office in March
1987. The administration had opposed creating a $540,000 fund for
hemophiliacs who contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from
blood transfusions.
   Haughey said the defeat convinced him opposition parties were
prepared to combine against Fianna Fail on certain issues.
   His administration had survived through the tacit support of the
Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, a faction that broke from
Fianna Fail.
   When the Dail was dissolved, Fianna Fail had 80 seats, Fine Gael
50, the Progressive Democrats 14, the Labor Party 11 and others 8.
Two seats are vacant.
   Haughey needs 83 seats for a majority in the 166-seat parliament.
The speaker automatically is returned and traditionally supports the
government.
   Confident of winning, Haughey opened with a positive campaign
emphasizing the government's record of fiscal prudence and economic
recovery.
   During his term, interest rates dropped to 9 percent, 5 points
lower than in Britain, and inflation to a modest 3.5 percent. The
budget deficit was pared from 15 percent of gross national product
in 1981 to about 5 percent.
   Those gains, however, come at the cost of continued high
unemployment of 17.5 percent, and emigration, largely of young
job-seekers, has accelerated to 40,000 a year.
   Haughey's cuts in public spending hit hard at Fianna Fail's
traditional rural and blue-collar support. Last week, Haughey
admitted being surprised at the intensity of anger about cuts in
public health services.
   Despite Haughey's problems, support for the combination of Fine
Gael and the Progressive Democrats reached only 34 percent in the
final poll of The Irish Times.
   About 2.4 million people are eligible to vote and 367 candidates
are running in 41 constituencies.

   France and the United States have decided to waive
mutual visa requirements for tourists and business travelers
starting July 1, the Foreign Ministry and U.S. Embassy said Monday.
   The United States is the last of the major countries for which
France established visa requirements following the September 1986
bomb wave in Paris that killed 11 people. French citizens have been
required to obtain visas to enter the United States since 1945.
   ``I hope that French tourists and businessmen will take advantage
of the convenience of this change in our visa regulations,'' said
Mark Lissfelt, charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy. ``The success
of this program should lead not only to greater tourist flows
between our two countries, but also to greater understanding as
well.''
   Visa requirements are being waived for tourists and business
travelers visiting France or the United States for less than three
months.
   The same arrangement for West German citizens takes effect July
15, the U.S. Embassy in Bonn said Monday. President Bush announced
the elimination of visa requirements during a visit to West Germany
two weeks ago.
   Visas still are required for French and West German students,
researchers, journalists and those planning to work or remain for
more than 90 days.
   French Tourism Minister Olivier Stirn said lifting visa
requirements has a ``symbolic value.''
   ``It translates into the excellence of relations between France
and the United States and ... should help the return of American
clientele to France.'' The imposition of visa requirements had
proved a ``serious brake on tourism,'' he said.
   Fewer than 1 million U.S. tourists visited France in 1986,
according to the Tourism Ministry. More than 2.4 million are
expected this year as France celebrates the bicentennial of its
Revolution.
   France imposed visa requirements in October 1986, exempting only
member nations of the European Economic Community, Switzerland and
Lichtenstein.

   Former Gov. Robert D. Orr of Indiana said
Monday that if confirmed as U.S. ambassador to Singapore he hopes to
persuade businesses all over the United States to ``investigate the
markets of Southeast Asia'' for export possibilities.
   ``If there is any country in the world where U.S. businesses have
a level playing field on which to compete, it is Singapore,'' Orr
told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``The Singaporean
economy is one of the most open and barrier free in the world.''
   Specifically, Orr said he will help U.S. companies in ``more
aggressive export sales efforts'' aimed at replacing Japan as the
largest single source of Singapore's imports.
   ``Most of Singapore's exports from the United States are capital
equipment and electronic components,'' Orr said. ``My goal will be
to broaden the product mix while expanding U.S. exports.''
   Orr said he will deal with complaints about Singapore's
restrictions on press freedom, especially on U.S.-owned
publications, with careful diplomacy.
   ``It is necessary to continue to carry the message,'' he said.
``I would hope it would finally result is somewhat more openness.''

   A former policeman received two life
prison sentences Monday for fatally shooting his estranged wife in
her judicial chambers and firing at three fellow officers.
   Clarence Ratliff, 53, showed no emotion when Circuit Judge Dennis
Kolenda announced his punishment for the Oct. 19 violence at the
Kent County Hall of Justice here that claimed the life of District
Judge Carol S. Irons, 40.
   Kolenda told Ratliff his punishment ``must show that no one is
above the law.''
   Outside the courtroom, Irons' friends and relatives hugged.
   Kolenda's office was flooded with thousands of letters requesting
Ratliff receive the harshest penalty allowable after a jury May 11
convicted the former officer of the lesser charge of voluntary
manslaughter.
   Ratliff, a 21-year veteran of the city police department, had
been charged with first-degree murder.
   Kolenda said he stepped outside sentencing guidelines because of
the crime's seriousness, its location, public sentiment and
Ratliff's position of trust in the community. Ratliff was off duty
at the time of the shootings.
   The former officer received the life sentences for his conviction
on two counts of assault with intent to murder for shooting at two
officers who came to Irons' aid. Neither officer was wounded.
   Ratliff got 10 to 15 years for the manslaughter conviction, as
well as a term of two years and eight months to four years for
assault with a firearm for shooting at a third officer.
   All the penalties were concurrent, except for a two-year sentence
for using a firearm during commission of a felony. As a result,
Ratliff will be eligible for parole in 10 years.
   Before sentencing, Kolenda allowed Irons' friends, family and
co-workers to address the court.
   Many said Ratliff should receive the maximum penalty because
Ratliff never showed remorse for the killing, although he apologized
to fellow officers moments after shooting at them.
   Ratliff, who declined to address the court, contended that he did
not intend to kill Irons but was drunk and angry about a property
dispute in their divorce proceedings.
   He shot Irons in the throat in her chambers, then followed as she
fled into a hallway, firing another shot.
   ``The jury found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter ... but we
know that Mr. Ratliff leveled his gun at her and watched for what
must surely have seemed an eternity before stealing her life away in
the blink of an eye,'' her parents, James and Virginia Irons, said
through their daughter's attorney and friend, Diann Landers.
   ``I think our message was heard,'' said Attorney Sara Smolenski,
a friend of the late judge who helped organize the Carol S. Irons
Committee for Justice, which staged rallies protesting the Ratliff
verdict and domestic violence.
   Defense attorney Grant Gruel said a decision on an appeal has not
been made.

   Egypt sought an expanded peacemaking role Monday
by offering its services as an ``active postman'' between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In Cairo, President Hosni Mubarak met with PLO chief Yasser
Arafat, who indicated hope remained for Israel's plan to start peace
negotiations with elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We have not rejected the idea of elections but we have specific
questions on the subject,'' Arafat said. ``Can there be democracy
without freedom? Can there be democracy without self-determination?''
   Mubarak told journalists in Cairo there is a new ``seriousness''
in the U.S. position on the Palestinian issue that could point
toward a settlement.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens rejected the offer by Egypt, with
which Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, to be middleman for
indirect negotiations. He said Israel does not want to enhance the
status of the PLO, which it still considers a terrorist organization.
   ``There is no room for mediation,'' Arens said after a 90-minute
meeting with Butros Ghali, Mubarak's minister of state for foreign
affairs, the most senior Egyptian official to visit Israel since a
Palestinian uprising began 18 months ago in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Arens expressed optimism about the prospects for Israel's peace
plan, even though both Palestinians and right-wing Israelis have
criticized it.
   He said Ghali gave the plan a ``sympathetic hearing'' and noted
that 94 of the 100 U.S. senators endorsed it last week.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir proposes elections in which
Palestinians would choose representatives to negotiate with Israel
on an interim autonomy plan to last five years. The final status of
the occupied territories then would be discussed.
   ``The ... plan has some positive and some negative elements, and
these negative elements must be corrected if we wish to obtain the
support or participation by the Palestinians in this plan,'' Ghali
said before returning to Cairo from a two-day visit.
   Palestinians insist on withdrawal of Israeli soldiers from the
occupied lands, or at least from population centers, and on
international supervision of the elections. They also seek
assurances their demands for an independent state would be realized.
   Mansour Shawa, a Gaza Strip businessman, said the Israeli plan
``does not meet the minimum aspirations of the Palestinian people.''
   He praised as ``well-balanced'' a new peace program advanced by
Asad Siftawi, a prominent PLO supporter from Gaza who recently
served a six-month prison term without trial.
   Under Siftawi's plan, Palestinians would take part in elections
without an Israeli withdrawal and would accept a stage-by-stage
solution provided that its ultimate goal of statehood be determined
beforehand.
   Shawa said of the plan: ``These are really minimum requirements
that would be acceptable to the Palestinians.''
   Shawa spoke after a breakfast meeting between Ghali and 30
prominent Palestinians in Herzliya, a Tel Aviv suburb. He quoted
Ghali as saying he was ready to serve as a link between Palestinians
in the occupied territories and the PLO as well as between Israel
and the PLO.
   ``I am ready to be a good and active postman,'' participants
quoted Ghali as saying.
   Several Palestinians boycotted the meeting with Ghali, including
some prominent supporters of the PLO. Some felt the meeting should
have been held in Arab east Jerusalem and others said they were
threatened by PLO militants.
   Saeed Kanaan, a West Bank businessman who did not attend, quoted
a caller representing PLO faction based in Syria as saying: ``Anyone
who meets with him will be killed. ... It is very easy to get to
you.''
   Ghali advised the Palestinians not be affected by hard-line
rhetoric by Israel, noting that hawks like former Prime Minister
Menachem Begin took seemingly unchangeable positions during
negotiations that led to the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
   Israel radio quoted Shamir as telling an audience of farmers the
government would halt talks with the Palestinians if their
negotiators insisted on an independent state rather than limited
autonomy for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied
territories.

   President Bush, declaring too many Americans
``breathe dirty air,'' unveiled an ambitious plan Monday to purge
urban smog from most cities by the year 2000 and to sharply reduce
acid-rain pollution.
   Environmentalists praised his effort but said he should go
further. The coal industry said he was trying ``too much too soon.''
   To curb smog-producing ozone, Bush recommended that automakers be
required to build and sell methanol-powered cars in nine urban areas
plagued by dirty air. And he recommended that limits on tailpipe
emissions of ozone-producing hydrocarbons in existing cars be
tightened by almost 40 percent.
   Bush also proposed a 10-million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide
emissions from coal-burning power plants, a major cause of acid
rain. If achieved, that would be a 50 percent cut.
   Moreover, he said industry should be required to use new
technology to curb the release of cancer-causing toxic chemicals
into the air.
   Bush outlined his legislative package at the White House in a
speech to members of Congress, governors, and industry and
environmental groups.
   Later, keeping the focus on the environment, he flew to
Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming for a first-hand look at damage
from the fires that blackened nearly half of the park's 2.2 million
acres last year. On Tuesday, he will make environmental speeches
near Jackson Hole, Wyo., and in Lincoln, Neb.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said cleaning the air ``will
neither be free nor easy.''
   The White House said the post-1995 cost of the acid rain program
would be about $3.8 billion a year, or a bit more than 2 percent of
the nation's current electric bills.
   To customers of the affected plants, rate increase could be
greater. On Board Air Force One, White Houes Chief of Staff John
Sununu said ratepayers in the affected states could expect increases
of 5 percent to 10 percent.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste told a news conference in Columbus
ratepayers in his state faced ``double-digit'' increases.
   At a briefing before Bush's speech, William Reilly, head of the
Environmental Protection Agency, estimated the overall program would
cost between $14 billion and $19 billion a year after it is in full
effect at the turn of the century.
   Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, said
Bush's plan had strong provisions for dealing with acid rain.
However, in the area of urban smog, he said he was concerned that
not enough was being proposed to deal with pollution from existing
gasoline-powered cars.
   ``Our concern is that he places a lot of reliance on new kinds of
fuel,'' Ayres said. ``I think he got an A for effort. He's heading
in the right direction.''
   In Canada, which blames half its acid rain on pullution flowing
in from the United States, Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said
at a news conference, ``I am advised the controls ... would satisfy
Canada's request for a 50 percent reduction in acid rain reaching
this country.'' He said Canada still hopes for a treaty to make the
new controls harder to weaken.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the Bush proposal was the most
positive move by the United States in a decade of Canadian
complaints and requests for action.
   Brooks B. Yeager, an Audubon Society official, said, ``We may
quarrel with some of the details but it's certainly a major step
forward.'' Yeager and other environmentalists said Bush was not
going far enough to control toxic poisons and other pollutants that
are severe public health threats.
   On the other hand, the president of the National Coal
Association, Richard L. Lawson, said Bush was ``seeking to
accomplish too much too soon.''
   ``Unfortunately, some of the provisions unveiled today are
unnecessary, unduly harsh and economically onerous,'' he said in a
statement. ``If enacted, they threaten to smother the economy and
stifle American competitiveness.''
   In his speech, Bush said the nation has made progress toward
clean air over the past 10 years but ``we have not come far enough.''
   ``Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air, and political
paralysis has plagued further progress against air pollution,'' he
said.
   Bush said, ``We've seen enough of this stalemate. It's time to
clear the air.''
   Republican Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, who has waged a dogged
campaign to clean up the environment in his state, said, ``This is
much further than I honestly expected the president to go.''
   Bush's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, did not try to tighten clean
air laws. The last overhaul of the landmark 1970 Clean Air Act was
in 1977.
   Bush said that dozens of cities currently do not meet federal
air-quality standards.
   Reilly ,head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the
proposal is ``going to solve that problem by the year 2000 for all
but two or three cities.'' And Bush said that within 20 years, by
the year 2010, ``even Los Angeles, Houston and New York will be
expected to make it.''
   Bush urged Congress to require automakers to phase in production
of cars that use alternate fuels such as methanol. By 1995, the
automakers would be required to sell 500,000 such cars in areas with
the worst smog. By 1997, the required number of cars would be 1
million.
   That effort would focus on nine urban areas: New York, Los
Angeles, Houston, Milwaukee, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego,
Chicago and metropolitan areas of Connecticut.
   Unlike gasoline, methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes the
severe smog problems that have made the air unhealthful in many
metropolitan areas.
   In an attempt to curb the release of toxic chemicals from
industrial plants, Bush proposed requiring industry to use the best
available technology to curb such pollution. The plan anticipates
``near term'' reductions in airborne toxic chemicals, including many
that are cancer causing, of between 75 and 90 percent.
   The proposal to combat acid rain calls for half of the
10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide to be achieved by 1995.
The proposal would allow utilities that exceed the required
reductions to accumulate credits that would be sold or traded to
other utilities that are unable to reach the reduction targets.
   About 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide gas are released annually
into the air, most from power plants that burn high-sulfur coal. The
gas turns into sulfates, combines with moisture and falls in rain or
snow, often hundreds of miles away.
   Scientists have blamed acid rain for causing substantial damage
to lakes, forests and aquatic life, especially in the Northeast and
Canada as a result of pollutants released from power plants in the
Ohio Valley and industrial Midwest.

   A would-be model died of an apparent
overdose of anesthetic during breast enlargement surgery, the
medical examiner says.
   Angela Umeda, a mother of two, died minutes after she was
injected numerous times with the local anesthetic lidocaine June 1,
an autopsy report Sunday said. The report ruled the death accidental.
   ``No one ever dreamed that this healthy 23-year-old would go in
for this seemingly simple procedure and come out dead,'' said Dewey
H. Varner, a lawyer for Umeda's mother. Umeda planned to marry on
July 2, Varner said.
   Umeda, a petite size 3 at 105 pounds, wanted to become a model
and went to Dr. Carl Fosdick for the $2,000 operation that he began
in his office, Varner said.
   ``She heard that she could do a little better in the modeling
field with larger breasts,'' Varner said.
   Umeda died of lidocaine intoxication, wrote Dr. John Marraccini,
Palm Beach County's chief deputy medical examiner.
   Tests found she had 14.7 milligrams of lidocaine per liter of
blood. ``Lidocaine is known to cause toxic reactions at half this
level,'' Marraccini said in a statement.
   ``The levels and circumstances at the scene seem to indicate an
excessive quantity of lidocaine was used,'' he said in an interview
Sunday.
   Fosdick didn't have office hours Monday and couldn't be reached
by telephon. His attorney, Earl L. Denney Jr., said:
   ``All I can say is the whole situation is a terrible tragedy for
Dr. Fosdick and a terrible tragedy for the family of Angela Umeda,
and Angela Umeda.''
   Marraccini said in the interview that Umeda appeared to be
healthy before the operation and had successfully undergone
anesthesia twice during childbirth.
   Dr. Alan Serure, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Miami, said
such deaths are ``very infrequent.''
   The nearly two-hour operation, in which a gel implant is placed
beneath the breast or chest muscle, can be performed in an office or
hospital, Serure said.
   ``It is not a particularly risky procedure; it is an everyday
procedure,'' he said.

   President Bush observed his birthday Monday
with a longer-than-customary jog ``to show that 65 can still do
three miles.''
   The noon-hour temperature was 77, the humidity was 60 percent and
Bush's T-shirt was soaked with presidential sweat by time he
finished his run at Fort McNair, an Army post in southwest
Washington.
   ``I wanted to show that 65 can still do three miles,'' Bush
puffed.
   Later, the Marine Band played ``Happy Birthday'' and someone
dressed in a gorilla outfit _ identified by the press office as
Budget Director Richard Darman _ pranced on the White House lawn as
Bush departed by helicopter for Andrews Air Force Base, Md. on the
first leg of a trip to the West. The president planned to inspect
regrowth at fire-damaged Yellowstone National Park and visit Grand
Teton National Park.
   The gorilla wore a red sash that read ``kinder, gentler'' and
carried gas-filled balloons marked ``education,'' ``S&amp;L'' and
``clean air.'' First lady Barbara Bush laughed and waved from the
balcony.
   When he was sworn in at age 64 in January, Bush was the fourth
oldest man ever inaugurated. White House physician Burton Lee says
Bush is in excellent shape and consequently ``10 years younger than
his stated age.''
   After Bush's midday jog, he reached into his limousine for a
plastic bag containing ice and cans of orange soda, tossed a soda to
an aide and had one himself.
   Accompanying the president on the run were a military police
cruiser and a few Secret Service agents in jogging gear carrying
walkie-talkies. At the end, a handful of other joggers were tailing
along, too.
   Also along for the run was Joseph Bagnerise Jr., 20, son of the
base commander and a junior in political science at Louisiana State
University.
   His father said that when he got word Bush was coming to the base
for a run, he rushed over to the State Department Credit Union,
where his son has a summer job, to bring him back to accompany the
president.
   Joe Jr. had run once before with Bush. His mother, JoAnn
Bagnerise, said she had worried that time about her son's ability to
keep up with Bush because the young man suffers from asthma. ``I was
afraid that he was going to embarrass himself, but he did all
right,'' she said.
   She carried a hastily made sign that said, ``Happy birthday Mr.
President, with Love,'' and some snapshots she had taken of Bush's
first run with her son. She took more snapshots Monday until her
camera ran out of film.
   Joe lifts weights and has such muscular arms that reporters on
the sidelines overheard Bush say, as they ran by, that he looked
like an LSU halfback.
   Turning to a reporter, Bush called out as he ran by, ``It
wouldn't hurt you to do a little (running) yourself.''
   On his way to Yellowstone National Park to inspect last summer's
fire damage, Bush invited reporters aboard Air Force One into his
compartment for a celebration, cutting a chocolate cake himself
while aides passed out champagne.
   The president, in a jovial mood, brandished a newspaper article
on the advantages senior citizens get, such as discounts on mass
transit fares.
   Barbara Bush _ who turned 64 on Thursday _ violated an agreement
not to exchange gifts this year and give him two pairs of tennis
shorts, the president said.
   On arrival at West Yellowstone, Montana, Bush was serenaded with
``Happy Birthday'' by about 700 well-wishers at the airport.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Linked to Robbery of Archaeological Museum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two college dropouts with links to drug
dealers and with an obsession for archaeology pulled off the robbery
of 124 priceless artifacts from the National Museum of Anthropology
in 1985, officials said Monday.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said the pair
visited the museum more than 50 times, made sketches and plans, then
jumped the fence, crawled in through an air-conditioning duct and
looted seven display cases before dawn on Christmas Day 1985.
   Federal police recovered 111 of the artifacts and arrested one of
the purported thieves and six associates Friday.
   Officials said investigators were stumped for more than three
years because they thought professionals were responsible.
   ``It turned out they were amateurs, two university dropouts who
became obsessed first with having and later with selling the
archaeological artifacts,'' a source at the attorney general's
office said, on condition of anonymity.
   Suspects include an American man and an Argentine woman, Alvarez
told a news conference, where the artifacts were exhibited on a long
table covered with green felt.
   ``Fortunately, the most significant pieces were recovered as you
can see for yourselves. We can place no value on them; they are
priceless,'' said Roberto Garcia Moll, director of the National
Institute for History and Anthropology, which supervises the museum.
   One major piece, a Zapotec mask of the bat god Murcielago from
the Monte Alban ruins in southern Mexico, had come apart and had to
be repaired, he said.
   Alvarez said Carlos Perches Trevino, 24, and Ramon Sardina Garcia
carefully staked out the museum. On Christmas Day they jumped the
fence of the poorly guarded building in Mexico City's Chapultepec
Park and crawled through an air-conditioning duct into the Maya
Room, he said.
   According to Alvarez, the pair filled a canvas bag with 124 jade,
gold and stone artifacts and drove off in a car they left parked
outside.
   He said they hid the treasure for more than an year, then took it
to Acapulco, the resort on the Pacific coast, where they met drug
traffickers and tried to interest one, identified as Salvador
Gutierrez, in buying the artifacts.
   Perches and Sardina traded Gutierrez several artifacts for an
unspecified amount of cocaine but never made a deal for the entire
cache, Alvarez said.
   He said ``the sum of $1 billion was apparently mentioned'' but no
deal materialized.
   Gutierrez was arrested on trafficking charges this year in
Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas, and mentioned the
artifacts while under police questioning, Alvarez said.
   Federal agents tailed Perches, who had returned to Mexico City
with the artifacts, for 45 days before the arrests last Friday.
   Alvarez said investigators initially thought 140 pieces were
stolen, but later determined the number to be 124.
   The artifacts are to be returned to the museum Wednesday at a
ceremony attended by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Alvarez said Perches is being charged with theft and damage to
national treasures _ charges that could mean 10 years in prison upon
conviction _ and an arrest warrant was issued for Sardina.
   Cocaine trafficking and possession charges were filed against
Perches; his brother Luis; a U.S. citizen named Gary Nathan Chafee
and an exotic dancer and restaurant owner named Isabel Camila
Maciero, who performed under the name of The Princess Yamal. Those
charges carry a penalty of up to 25 years.
   Chafee and two friends of Perches, Juan Castillo Carriles and
Hugo Ricardo Perez Radilla, are being charged with cover-up.
   Alvarez said an Argentine woman identified as Cristina Gloria
Gonzalez was marginally involved and would be deported.
   A U.S. Embassy source, who insisted on anonymity, described
Chafee only as a ``longtime resident of Mexico City.''

   Mayor Edward I. Koch and the eight men seeking to
unseat him signed a pledge Monday to avoid any appeals to prejudice
or bigotry during their campaigns.
   But the candidates, meeting en masse for the first time, made
clear that the deal did not preclude old-fashioned, sharp-tongued
political rhetoric.
   ``This is not a campaign for president of the high school,'' Koch
reminded the group. ``This is a campaign for mayor, and I assume we
are going to be critical of one another.''
   Koch and some of his opponents already have swapped attacks.
   Republican Rudolph W. Giuliani wished out loud for a broader
truce, one barring all ``groundless and false charges'' among the
candidates.
   No one took him up on it, and Giuliani, a former federal
prosecutor, went on to defend a particularly pointed attack on one
of his opponents, cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, by one of his
allies, local Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding.
   Harding last week called Lauder ``a man whose family business
would sell Israel out for a few riyals from Saudi Arabia.'' He based
that on a comment by Lauder's mother, Estee Lauder, that she
preferred not to sell in Israel.
   ``Fair comment on an issue that had been raised by someone
else,'' said Giuliani.
   But mostly, the candidates kept their comments good-natured.
   When Richard Ravitch came in late, he took fellow Democrat
Harrison J. Goldin's seat while Goldin spoke at the podium.
   ``That's not the seat I want, anyway,'' Goldin joked.
   Then Republican and Right-to-Life Party candidate Henry Hewes
took a seat vacated by Koch, and the mayor told Hewes: ``That's
probably the only time you'll have it.''
   ``That's a cheap shot,'' protested Hewes. ``I think I'll file a
complaint.''
   The candidates were convened by the Committee on Decent Unbiased
Campaign Tactics _ ``Conduct'' _ which said it would investigate
complaints of appeals to bigotry. If a transgression were confirmed,
the candidate would be asked to repudiate it.
   ``We don't seek to keep passion or pride out of these
campaigns,'' said Conduct's leader, R. Peter Straus. ``We embrace
pride and passion. But we reject _ we will not tolerate _ prejudice
or bigotry in this campaign.''
   Critics accused Koch of racial insensitivity during the
presidential campaign last year, when he said Jews ``have got to be
crazy'' to vote for Jesse Jackson because of Jackson's position on
Israel.

   A former teacher of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini has been chosen as Iran's paramount religious leader, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
   It said Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Araki, 95, was selected by
prominent Shiite Moslem theologians to succeed Khomeini who died
June 3 at the age of 86.
   The paramount religious leader, or marja' taqlid, is Iran's
authority on religious matters.
   Khomeini was Iran's highest religious and political authority.
President Ali Khamenei, who succeeded in the political role, is a
middle-ranking cleric without the authority to rule on religious
matters.
   The news agency said Araki has written a Towzih al-Maisal, a book
paramount religious leaders prepare as a guide, but he told
followers to use the book written by Khomeini. Araki taught Khomeini
at the Qom Theological Seminary in Iran.

   Vice President Dan Quayle sought
help Monday from Latin American allies in pressuring Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega out of power in Panama and warned of the possibility
of an anti-democratic alliance among Cuba, Nicaragua and Panama.
   On the first full day of a three-day tour of Central America,
Quayle met with the presidents of Honduras and Guatemala and said he
discussed with them possible future measures against Noriega if an
Organization of American States initiative now under way fails to
remove him from power.
   ``If in fact he doesn't leave, we will have to pursue other
options,'' said Quayle. Without being specific, Quayle said the
options could include ``political and economic concerns Panama has
with other countries.''
   Quayle made those comments to reporters before traveling from
Guatemala to Honduras. He met with Guatemalan President Vinicia
Cerezo in Guatemala City and Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoya in
Tegucigalpa. Later, Quayle met with two candidates in that country's
November presidential election.
   The vice president, at all times protected by a large security
detail, also had lunch with U.S. troops at an Air Force base outside
the Honduran capital.
   The United States already has in place economic and trade
sanctions against Panama. President Bush recently strengthened the
U.S. troop presence there.
   Quayle would not discuss the new OAS initiative, other than to
say the United States supports it.
   But an official traveling with the vice president said in general
terms that the OAS plan would provide for deposing Noriega and for a
national dialogue leading to the installation of a democratically
elected government.
   That official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
Quayle was interested in the OAS proposal but was insistent that
Noreiga must step down before such a dialogue is begun.
   Quayle, referring to recent reports that Nicaragua was planning
to send arms to Panama to help forces loyal to Noriega in the event
of a U.S. attack, said he was concerned about a possible
anti-democratic axis involving Panama, Cuba and Nicaragua, a
development he said ``would destabilize Central America.''
   Quayle said the leaders with whom he met were united in their
opposition to Noriega's staying in power.
   Cerezo, however, said that while he supports democracy in Panama,
its autonomy must also be respected.
   ``It is important to not confuse bilateral relations,'' between
the United States and Panama, ``with the concerns of the
hemisphere,'' Cerezo told reporters at the national palace.
   U.S. officials traveling with Quayle said Cerezo adopted a
harsher stance toward Noriega in the private meeting with the vice
president.
   Azcona told reporters that his position regarding Noriega
coincided with that of the United States.
   Latin nations have not shown much enthusiasm for interfering in
Panama beyond verbal condemnations of Noriega for invalidating the
results of the May 7 election, which independent observers said was
overwhlemingly won by his opposition.
   At one point while in Guatemala, Quayle stopped his motorcade on
a busy downtown street, drawing crowds of onlookers. He entered an
open-front store and purchased a soccer ball for his children,
tossing it with some bystanders before moving on.

<TEXT>
   The federal government Monday allowed
Broomfield to resume digging a ditch around its reservoir to divert
a stream allegedly contaminated by hazardous wastes from the Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant.
   ``The size of the stream and of the impacted area is not that
significant,'' said Max Dodson, director of water management for the
Environmental Protection Agency's Denver office. He said the EPA
would not require Broomfield to obtain a permit for the project.
   ``I'm elated,'' City Manager George DiCiero said after learning
of EPA's decision. ``We will resume digging tomorrow.''
   The Army Corps of Engineers will issue a letter of confirmation
allowing Broomfield to proceed.
   DiCiero said the city of 27,600 began digging a diversion ditch
and building an earthen dam to divert Walnut Creek following U.S.
Justice Department allegations that Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant dumped hazardous chemicals into the creek.
   Walnut Creek flows out of Rocky Flats into Great Western
Reservoir, which supplies half of Broomfield's drinking water. The
creek provides about 5 percent of the town's total water needs.
   The debate over the diversion canal was the latest development
involving federal and state investigations of illegal dumping and
burning at Rocky Flats, located 16 miles northwest of Denver. Last
Tuesday, 75 FBI agents and EPA investigators raided the plant. The
Department of Energy facility, operated by contractor Rockwell
International, makes plutonium detonators for nuclear bombs.
   Initially, the government said Broomfield needed a permit from
the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers to divert Walnut Creek, and work
on the ditch was stopped Monday pending the outcome of discussions.
   City officials met for much of the day with federal officials at
the EPA office in Denver and then toured the ditch and dam site.
After the on-site inspection, Dodson announced his decision.
   ``The flow in the river is an absolute trickle,'' Dodson said,
adding that the affected area was less than one acre. ``I respect
Broomfield's effort to develop a safety margin here.''
   The EPA decision was based on Broomfield's project falling into a
category of water diversion that only requires a letter of
confirmation from the Army Corps of Engineers, Dodson said.
   The diversion project is expected to cost about $50,000.
   DiCiero said Broomfield requested permission to divert the creek
two or three months ago but got no response from the EPA until
digging began Saturday.
   Broomfield officials said they wrote Rocky Flats operators last
week requesting no more water from the plant be discharged into the
creek.
   A spokesman for plant operator Rockwell International said
officials would consider the request.
   Gov. Roy Romer, meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Monday to meet
with the head of the Department of Energy, said DOE chief Adm. James
D. Watkins pledged to immediately address the need for better
monitoring of hazardous wastes coming from Rocky Flats.
   The government charged in an affidavit made public last week that
Rocky Flats illegally dumped hazardous chemicals into the creek on
Nov. 15-16, 1988, and also that hazardous wastes were illegally
burned at the plant.
   Federal officials said then they didn't believe there was any
health hazard, and the state Health Department Monday said samples
taken over the weekend of drinking water in Broomfield and other
communities were not contaminated by any of 59 organic substances
typically analyzed in checking drinking water.
   However, the state still was testing for 13 other chemicals
specifically cited by federal investigators in their probe of Rocky
Flats. Results were expected later in the week, department assistant
director Tom Looby said.
   ``We are confident that these initial tests indicate that the
likelihood of any of the 13 chemicals being found in these drinking
water supplies is very, very small,'' Looby said.

   The Council of State ruled Monday that the
33 top Communist Party and government officials who lost in the June
4 elections even though they ran unopposed cannot be candidates in
runoff elections.
   Only two candidates of the 35 on the ``national list'' received a
majority of votes in the elections and will take their seats in the
460-seat Sejm _ lower house of parliament.
   The other 33, including Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski,
failed to get the required 50 percent of the vote and the Council of
State said they could not be candidates in the runoff elections this
Sunday.
   It said that instead, competitive elections for the 33 vacant
seats will be held with two candidates running for each seat.
   Solidarity and other opposition groups will not be able to enter
candidates for those seats, however.
   The council said 66 new candidates will be selected by the
Communist Party and its allies _ the Peasants and Democratic parties
and several small pro-government Roman Catholic groups.
   After the ruling Rakowski announced he would not seek a seat in
the new parliament, but he did not rule out continuing to lead the
government.
   Others on the ``national list'' who lost when they failed to get
a majority in the June 4 balloting include Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak and six other members of the Communist Party
Politburo.
   Also Monday a judge registered a journalists' union banned in
1982, continuing the process of restoring legal status to
independent groups affiliated with the Solidarity union movement.
   ``We don't treat this day as a victory, merely a return to
normality,'' said Stefan Bratkowski, president of the Association of
Polish Journalists.
   The association had been replaced by a union of journalists that
was approved by the government after the 1981 martial law crackdown.
During the martial-law period Solidarity was outlawed and the
government purged 500 to 1,000 journalists from offical publications
for their political views.
   Solidarity was legalized again following an agreement with the
government in April that also prepared the way for the elections.
   Rakowski announced he would not run for the Sejm in a statement
to the state's PAP news agency. He said he wanted to ensure ``the
will of the electorate would not be offended.''
   But he left open the possibility of continuing as prime minister,
a post he assumed in September. Polish law does not require the
prime minister to be a member of parliament.
   ``I am not withdrawing from public life,'' Rakowski said.
   ``Just the opposite, with all my might I will serve my nation in
any posts my party and constitutional authorities of the state
entrust to me and which I consider possible to accept.''
   The June 4 elections were the freest in Poland in more than four
decades and Solidarity-supported candidates won 160 of the 161 seats
open to the opposition in the 460-seat Sejm. Opposition candidates
could run for all 100 seat in the new Senate and they won 92.
   In addition to the 33 ``national list'' vacancies, Sunday's
runoff elections are to decide 262 contested Sejm seats and eight
Senate seats for which no candidate got 50 percent of votes.
   The decision not to allow any of the defeated ``National List''
candidates to run again appeared aimed at heading off voters
claiming their June 4 decision was thwarted.
   After the elections the Sejm and Senate elect a president _
presumably Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski by virtue
of the party's built-in majority in the Sejm.
   The new president names a prime minister to form a new government.

<TEXT>
   Parliament, once described by a member as ``the
longest-running farce in the West End,'' has been added to Britain's
fall television schedule.
   The mother of parliaments voted Monday to admit television
cameras, but adopted rules ensuring the electronic eye will be too
polite to notice rude behavior.
   ``If someone behaves in a disorderly, silly or boorish manner,
why should this be kept from the people who elected them?'' asked
Labor Party legislator Frank Dobson.
   That happens, especially at question time when Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and her ministers face hostile questions from the
opposition, alternated with softballs tossed by Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative backbenchers.
   In the sport of parliamentary discourse, such exchanges are
shouted above a din of wisecracks, jeering or a drone of ``hear,
hear.''
   Speaker of the House Bernard Weatherill has to bellow ``Order!
Order!'' when the right honorable members are particularly frisky.
   In the event of an ``occasion of grave disorder'' television
cameras will be obliged to zero in on Weatherill, not the ruckus in
the benches.
   If the speaker is receiving advice from a lowly clerk, the rules
adopted Monday require the camera turn away.
   Otherwise, the lens may gaze at the head and shoulders of the
legislator speaking, although a reaction shot is permitted if
another member is mentioned by name.
   John Wakeham, leader of the House of Commons and chairman of the
select committee on televising its proceedings, said the rules will
produce an ``electronic Hansard'' _ a video equivalent of the
official printed record.
   The 9-month experiment begins in November when Queen Elizabeth II
presides at the state opening of Parliament. The following July the
house will debate whether to permit permanent coverage.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. and Independent Television News
have protested the restrictions.
   ``The range of camera shots being proposed is so restricted,
especially during questions and statements and during what the
report describes as periods of disorder, that what the viewers will
be seeing may well be less than full, balanced, fair and accurate,''
said ITN associate editor Glyn Mathias.
   ``There will be a burden on the commentator to explain to viewers
what they cannot see for themselves,'' he added.
   An amendment to permit unrestricted coverage was defeated on a
vote of 274-98.
   Matthew Parris, author of the Commons Sketch in The Times of
London, ridiculed the rules last month.
   ``Readers, at any given moment, the least interesting thing in
the chamber is the member speaking,'' he wrote.
   ``Nick Budgen interrupting, Ted Heath snoozing, Frank Haynes
snarling, Simon Hughes bleating, Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman
screeching, Roy Hattersley digesting _ these are the stuff of which
Parliament is made.''
   The House of Lords has permitted television coverage of its
debates for 4{ years, and viewers occasionally may glimpse a peer of
the realm sleeping soundly.
   Television newscasts now use tape recordings of statements in
Parliament along with a still photograph of the speaker.

<HEAD>Loan of $4.6 Billion Planned for Venezuela</HEAD>

   The International Monetary Fund may approve
this month a $4.6 billion loan to Venezuela, officials said Monday,
a move which would complete a process begun in February after riots
in Venezuela linked to government austerity measures.
   The riots, in which the government said 246 people were killed,
were triggered by increases in bus fares and gasoline prices as part
of a program to satisfy the IMF and other creditors.
   The day after the violence broke out in Caracas, Veneuzuelan
officials reached a tentative accord with the fund.
   The officials, who declined to be quoted by name, said Monday IMF
staff has completed work on the loan. It now has to be presented to
the fund's Board of Executive Directors, who represent the 151
member governments. The United States has about 19 percent of the
voting power.
   Part of the new loan could go to reduce Venezuela's existing debt
of more than $35 billion. Private bankers, to whom almost all the
money is owed, would be urged to reduce old debt in return for IMF
assurances that interest would be promptly paid on the remaining
debt.

<HEAD>Kean Meets with Reilly, Senators on Wetlands Protection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More American wetlands could be saved through
tax breaks and other incentives than through regulations, a group of
senators told Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William
K. Reilly Monday.
   Reilly and New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, chairman of the National
Wetlands Policy Forum, met with nine senators to discuss strategies
for stemming the loss of America's shrinking wetlands.
   ``The administration previously thought it would confine itself
to executive orders,'' said Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I. ``You do
better with incentives,'' he said after the meeting.
   ``You get a lot more with a carrot than a stick,'' Kean said of
the incentive approach that might be offered to farmers, developers
and private landowners to encourage actions that would help protect,
if not increase, swamps, estuaries and other water-soaked land that
protects wildlife, cleans waterways and helps regulate streamflow.
   More than 50 percent of tidal wetlands in the lower 48 states is
in private hands. Senators conveyed their concern that federal
wetlands policy be fair to landowners, Kean said.
   ``A lot of senators wanted to make sure this wasn't a
confiscatory policy,'' Kean said. ``We want to make sure for those
areas where wetlands are acquired, they receive full compensation,''
he said.
   Senators such as James A. McClure, R-Idaho, said environmental
policymakers might work from the example of historic preservation
programs, which have been based upon tax breaks for those who
rehabilitate buildings to strict federal standards, Chafee said.
   The 20-member National Wetland Policy Forum, made up of state and
local officials, farmers, businessmen, developers and academic
experts, returned a set of more than 100 recommendations last fall,
aimed at achieving ``no net loss'' of wetlands. President Bush
endorsed such a goal in the campaign.
   No one is certain, but there have been estimates that up to
400,000 acres of wetlands have been lost to development annually in
recent years.
   The forum was convened with the help of the Conservation
Foundation, which Reilly headed before being named EPA chief.

   President Bush's nominee to be U.S. ambassador
to New Zealand expressed hope Monday that New Zealand would drop a
policy that bans warships carrying nuclear weapons from its
territorial waters.
   The nominee, Della M. Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate
broker who served as Washington state chairman of Bush's
presidential campaign, said opinion polls show most New Zealnders
oppose the breakup of the Anzus mutual defense treaty between
Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
   ``We can hope that as time goes by the preponderance of the
opinion'' will bring New Zealand's government to drop the ban, Ms.
Newman said.
   ``The task of improving relations between the United States and
New Zealand on security issues will not be easy,'' she said. ``It
will require a generous measure of commitment, patience and
sensitivity.''
   Also appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee om
Monday was Mel Sembler, nominated by Bush to be U.S. ambassador to
Australia, who said he looks forward to enhancing the close ties
between the two nations.
   Sembler is a Florida businessman and founder of Straight, an
adolescent drug rehabilitation program. If confirmed, he will also
be ambassador to the tiny island nation of Nauru.

   President Bush on Monday
toured a geyser basin blackened by the devastating fire that swept
through Yellowstone last year and then went fishing in the shadow of
snow-streaked mountains of Grand Teton National Park.
   Bush walked for nearly a half hour among a section of charred
lodgepole pine trees, asking park authorities about the blaze that
burned on nearly half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres.
   Shown plant seedlings in abundance on the ground, Bush asked,
``Are there jillions others underneath?''
   He questioned whether the burnt orange needles on the trees
indicated the trees might survive. John Varley, the park's chief
scientist, assured Bush they were dead.
   The National Park Service has previously released surveys aimed
at showing the park was well on its way to recovery.
   Bush flew to West Yellowstone, Mont., from Washington after
announcing a sweeping clean-air program to reduce acid rain, urban
smog and cancer-causing toxic chemicals.
   An airport crowd of several hundred people seranaded him with
``Happy Birthday'' on his 65th birthday.
   Bush was accompanied on the trip by one of his 11 grandchildren,
George P. Bush, and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, whose
department oversees the National Park Service.
   From West Yellowstone, Bush and his party of White House aides,
security officials and others flew in five helicopters over
Yellowstone Park, inspecting the fire damage from the air before
landing in a geyser basin.
   Bush wore a blue western shirt, green slacks and hiking shoes,
but most of his senior staff members were dressed in dark suits and
ties.
   After the tour, the president said he had received a ``very
positive assessment'' of the regrowth. The rest of his remarks was
drowned out by the roar of the helicopter motor.
   Closing out the day, Bush returned to his helicopter and went to
Jackson Hole, Wyo., to spend the night at a government guest house,
Brinkerhoff Lodge on the banks of Jackson Lake.
   Immediately on his arrival, Bush and his grandson, accompanied by
security personnel, took off in boats for an evening of fishing.
   Before his arrival at Yellowstone, Bush said, ``One of my
greatest pleasures in life is going fishing with my grandchildren.''
Bush had traveled with this particular grandson to the Grand Tetons
before.
   On Tuesday, Bush will deliver a speech at the Teton Science
School on his clean air legislative proposals. He also will speak at
Lincoln, neb., before returning to Washington.
   Before his arrival, the president said he was going to
Yellowstone because ``there are areas in this country with good
quality air that you want to make sure stay good quality.''
   ``Unless the nation makes a commitment to clean up its air,''
Bush said, ``even areas such as Yellowstone would have a tough time
with air quality.''

   A man castrated by two masked men before he was
convicted of raping a teen-age girl has evidence for a new trial,
his attorney told a federal appeals court Monday.
   The case against Wayne Dumond of Forrest City, Ark., was an
``absolute failure of justice,'' attorney John Wesley Hall told a
three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Dumond, convicted in 1985 of raping and kidnapping the Forrest
City teen, is serving a prison sentence of life plus 20 years.
   Hall said Dumond deserved an opportunity to question the girl
regarding new genetic evidence the attorney said proved his client
could not have committed the rape.
   Last January, U.S. Magistrate H. David Young in Little Rock, Ark.
denied Dumond's request for a new trial and motions to subpoena the
victim and her father.
   Young said the victim's identification of Dumond was strong and
that the ``newly discovered evidence of an inconclusive scientific
test would not likely produce a verdict of acquittal upon retrial.''
   Hall contended Monday that it was necessary to question the
victim in connection with new genetic evidence derived from semen
found on her pant leg.
   Hall said the genetic test proved Dumond could not have committed
the rape and that the procedure was more than 99 percent accurate.
   The attorney also claimed the victim's initial identification of
Dumond was shaky and that she was coached by her father in picking
Dumond out of a lineup.
   Assistant Attorney General Theodore Holder said he had moved to
quash the subpoenas so the victim would not be put through further
painful testimony.
   Holder said her testimony would not have changed.
   ``Her identification was solid,'' he said. ``She never varied.''
   While Dumond was awaiting trial, two masked men broke into his
home and bound and castrated him. No arrests have been made in that
case.
   In a brief Hall filed earlier this year with the federal appeals
court, Dumond identified the girl's father as one of the men
involved in the attack at his home.
   The brief said that after the castration, then-St. Francis County
Sheriff Coolidge Conlee time had Dumond's testicles preserved in
formaldehyde and displayed them for about two weeks on his desk.
   Dumond subsequently won a lawsuit against Conlee, and the case
was settled for $110,000, Hall said.

   China ordered a nationwide alert Tuesday for
dissident Fang Lizhi, telling local authorities to arrest him at
once if he is seen trying to escape the country.
   The government on Monday gave security forces permission to shoot
people who incite unrest and outlawed all independent student and
worker groups.
   Fang and his wife Li Shuxian have been sequestered in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing since a military crackdown on pro-democracy
protests on June 3. They are accused by the government of
``committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda and
instigation.''
   Beijing's Public Security Bureau issued orders Tesday that
``other provinces, other cities, all airports and all guards on the
border should carry out the arrest warrant'' against Fang and his
wife. The order was read over Beijing radio.
   The government has strongly protested to the United States for
giving shelter to Fang, calling it interference in China's internal
affairs.
   In Washington the State Department said Chinese security forces
surrounded the embassy in an obvious effort to keep other dissidents
from taking refuge there.
   Chinese television broadcast photographs of Fang and his wife
Monday night.
   ``Don't let these people flee,'' the announcer said. ``They are
wanted for counterrevolutionary crimes.''
   Fang, a renowned astrophysicist, played no active role in recent
student-led demonstrations for democratic reforms. However, he has
been an outspoken critic of the Communist Party, saying the Marxist
system has failed here and economic reform will not work unless
accompanied by sweeping political reform.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and other department
officials met with China's ambassador in Washington, Han Xu, over
the weekend to discuss the Fang case. The Bush administration
indicated earlier it would not let the Chinese arrest the Fangs.
   The U.S. Embassy compound is regarded as American soil under
international law, and Chinese authorities cannot enter without the
embassy's permission.
   The attacks on Fang are part of a nationwide propaganda campaign
to discredit the pro-democracy movement and justify the harsh
military crackdown in Beijing that killed or injured thousands of
people, including many students.
   The government on Monday told police and soldiers nationwide they
had the right to shoot ``rioters and counterrevolutionaries.'' At
the same time it banned independent student and worker associations.
   Security forces made hundreds of further arrests, including
several leaders of independent labor unions, bringing the number of
announced arrests to more than 1,000 across China.
   All developments pointed to a strengthening of the government's
effort to suppress the movement for a freer society and an end to
official corruption.
   The crackdown began June 3 when thousands of soldiers from the
People's Liberation Army entered Beijing and marched on Tiananmen
Square, which was occupied by thousands of students.
   China's government says nearly 300 people were killed, mostly
soldiers. However, Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence said
the toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler challenged Chinese
government assertions that troops did not fire on students massed in
Tiananmen. ``The whole world has seen what happened,'' she said
Monday.
   Ms. Tutwiler said if Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, ``was
responsible for the brutal attack on Tiananmen Square, then he has
acted to undercut the very reform process he has sought to foster.''
   In Ottawa, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said Canada's
ambassador in Beijing is being recalled temporarily to protest the
killings.
   The widening crackdown was further evidence that hardliners led
by Deng have gained control of the government after a power struggle
with leaders more sympathetic to student demands.
   One Western diplomat described the present situation in Beijing
as a ``cold terror aimed at cowing the population.''
   ``Several of us have seen arrests made at gunpoint and police
beating people in the streets,'' he said Monday, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``From what we've seen in the last few days
we can't seriously expect the police or troops to be fussy about who
they shoot.''
   Chinese media said life in Beijing had returned to normal and bus
lines were running and banks were open.
   But posters began appearing asking for information about
relatives who disappeared in the violent suppression.
   Fear has spread through the capital. Chinese have begun refusing
to see foreign reporters and report that among their work units,
movement has begun to ferret out pro-democracy supporters.
   In a statement foreshadowing a possible purge in the ruling
Communist Party, Beijing Vice-Mayor Huang Chao called on every party
organization to look at the movement ``as a severe test for every
Communist Party member.''
   The Ministry of Public Security said police and soldiers should
use their weapons against ``rioters and counterrevolutionaries'' to
curb criminal activity, defined as ``disrupting social order'' and
``riots.''
   It marked the first time the government acknowledged that police
and soldiers nationwide have been given the right to fire on
protesters.
   State-run radio and TV said hundreds of arrests were made Monday
in the provincial capitals of Hangzhou, Xian, Nanjing and Shanghai.
Among the arrested in Shanghai were Li Zhibo, a leader of the
independent workers union, and Yao Yongzhan, a 19-year-old Hong Kong
student.
   Li was shown being held at gunpoint by police. It appeared he had
been beaten. His face was swollen so badly he could barely open his
eyes.
   Protest supporters in Shanghai, China's largest city with 12
million people, said Monday that authorities had snuffed out the
democracy movement there through intimidation and arrests.
   In its statement, the Ministry of Public Security banned student
and worker groups that headed the pro-democracy movement, and
ordered their leaders to turn themselves in immediately. If they
didn't, they would be punished severely, it said.
   Chinese media accused the Voice of America, listened to widely in
China, of ``spreading rumors'' about the disturbances.

   A stuntman hired to promote a new frozen treat
climbed a rope up the side of the Daily News Building on Tuesday,
entertaining the lunch-hour crowd below until police hauled him in.
   Nathan Taylor started by climbing out a 15th-floor window. He
used climbing gear to ease his way up a rope hanging from the top of
the building and made it to the 26th floor before Emergency Services
police made him come inside.
   ``There he is _ Spider Man!'' yelled a construction worker across
42nd Street. ``It must be some sort of ad, or something.''
   Taylor, a 1969 Amateur Athletics Union springboard high diving
champion, hammed it up, waving broadly and swinging away from the
building.
   People on the street pointed, squinted upward and asked each
other what was happening.
   ``He's a brave guy,'' said Almeyda Cabrera, who works around the
corner at an insurance company. ``If this was my building, everybody
would be hanging out the window, looking at him.''
   ``Have they got a permit?'' scolded Mark Lerner, who works across
from the News. ``He's endangering his life and those underneath
him.''
   Police wondered that, too, and cut short Taylor's roof-bound
ascent, ordering him in through a window.
   While Taylor leaned out of a police van window, smiling for
photographers, David M. Singer, a spokesman for Jell-O, the sponsor,
produced paperwork that he said showed police gave permission for
the stunt.
   Then, police let Taylor go.
   ``They're just doing their job,'' he said, thrusting a free
Citrus Snowburst into the crowd.

   The battle for control of the nation's largest
Protestant denomination enters its 11th year Tuesday, with moderates
making an ``11th hour'' bid for the presidency of the Southern
Baptist Convention.
   ``I think the Southern Baptist Convention is in serious
condition, serious trouble,'' said Daniel Vestal, the moderate
candidate for the convention presidency. ``A lot of people are at
the point of dropping out.''
   Paul Pressler, a Houston judge who has helped rally conservatives
to 10 straight presidential victories in the convention since 1979,
said a win by moderates would result in ``confusion and turmoil''
for a few more years.
   ``The course correction has been made,'' Pressler said.
   Convention officials expect 15,000 messengers, or delegates, for
the three-day meeting that opens Tuesday morning.
   The focus of the convention is the presidential election Tuesday
afternoon, with the 44-year-old Vestal trying to unseat Jerry Vines,
51, Moyers withdrew a request to
appear before the Executive Committee to discuss its criticism of
his ``God and Politics'' documentary. The committee in February said
the documentary was biased in support of Southern Baptist moderates.
   Referring to Pressler, Moyers said in a letter to the committee,
``There is no way to get a fair hearing from an executive committee
that has become a rubber stamp for a secular politician who has
infected this Christian fellowship with the partisan tactics of
malice, manipulation and untruth.''
   Conservatives, who take the Bible as literal truth, accuse
moderates of being open to interpretations that challenge the
foundations of Southern Baptist faith.
   ``Beyond question, the central issue is theological,'' Vines
said. ``I believe that the Bible does not merely contain the word of
God, but that the Bible is the word of God.''
   If one questions part of the truth of the Bible, he said,
everything is open to question, including accounts of the
resurrection of Christ.
   But moderates charge conservatives with violating another central
belief of Southern Baptists _ that believers can interpret the Bible
for themselves.
   ``I think the issue is freedom: Are we going to be free or are we
going to be a controlled denomination?'' said Vestal, pastor of
Dunwoody Baptist Church in suburban Atlanta. ``Are we going to be
creedal or non-creedal?''
   Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern Baptist Alliance
in Washington, said the dispute revisits the battleground of
American Protestantism in the early 20th century.
   ``The key questions are questions like `Were Adam and Eve real
people? Was the world created in six, 24-hour periods?''' he said.
``The moderates respond those questions are theologically
irrelevant.''

congressional scandal of the 1970s, Monday was found guilty for the
second time of shoplifting shoes and clothes from a suburban
Washington department store.
   After deliberating for 35 minutes, the Fairfax County Circuit
Court jury found Jenrette guilty of petty larceny through switching
price tags at Marshall's discount department store in Tyson's Corner
on Dec. 7.
   The jury recommended a $1,000 fine and six months in jail for
each of the two misdemeanor charges. But the fact that Jenrette was
on probation could greatly lengthen that term.
   ``This could trigger three years extra in prison,'' said defense
attorney Steve Merril. ``It's a tremendous setback to his life.''
   Sentencing was set for Aug. 18.
   Upon hearing the verdict, Jenrette sat motionless and stared
straight ahead. He was whisked out a back door and did not speak
with reporters.
   Jenrette had been found guilty on both charges by Fairfax Circuit
County Circuit Judge Donald B. McDonough on Feb. 23. He appealed
that verdict in an attempt to bring his case before a jury where he
felt he could succeed in creating reasonable doubt.
   But the jury believed Marshall's store guards, who said they saw
Jenrette leave the store wearing stolen shoes and carrying a tie
that he had pocketed off a rack.
   Guard Heather McKeever said she also saw Jenrette remove the
price tags from a pair of pants and a shirt and replace them with
the tags from lower-priced merchandise.
   Ms. McKeever also said she saw Jenrette try on a pair of
Marshall's shoes and place his own in the bottom row of the store's
shoe rack.
   When Jenrette walked out of the store, he was apprehended by Ms.
McKeever and guard John Brown, who supported her testimony in court.
   Jenrette, testifying in his own behalf, said he ``flat forgot''
that he was wearing the new shoes.
   ``I had them on for 35-40 minutes and embarrasingly forgot I had
them on,'' he said. He denied switching price tags and claimed the
tie in his pocket was his own that he had brought into the store to
compare with a tie he was considering purchasing.
   Part of Merril's defense was the fact that Jenrette left behind a
$125 pair of shoes, and that the camera used by the security guards
didn't give an accurate depiction of events.
   Assistant Commonthwealth's Attorney William Pickett, in his
closing argument, called Jenrette's story ``totally fiction'' and
said the evidence against the former lawmaker was ``overwhelming.''
   Jenrette, who served in Congress from 1975 to 1980, was sentenced
to two years in prison and five years probation after being
convicted in the ABSCAM sting operation in which FBI agents posing
as Arab sheiks and businessmen offered bribes to lawmakers.
   Jenrette served 13 months in prison and is currently on probation.

   The radio-commanded firing of an
onboard motor Monday shifted a new navigation satellite into a
circular orbit about 11,000 miles above the Earth, the Air Force
reported.
   The Navstar satellite was launched here Saturday into a
preliminary ellitical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles
high.
   The new satellite is the second advanced model Navstar to be
launched. It is designed to tell U.S. and allied military forces
where they are within 50 feet anywhere in the world _ on land, sea
or in the air, and in any weather.
   Ground stations tracked the satellite for nearly two days to
accurately determine its orbital path, then sent a radio signal at
3:12 p.m. Monday to start the motor. On the new path, the
satellite's high and low points are both at about 11,000 miles.
   ``The burn was succesful and everything looks good,'' said Lt.
Johnn Kennedy, a spokesman for the Air Force Space Division in Los
Angeles.
   Officials said ground controllers would check out the payload's
systems for between 35 and 40 days before placing it on operational
patrol, joining eight other Navstar satellites already in orbit.

<HEAD>Designer of Famed Mosquito Aircraft is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Bishop, who designed Britain's ``Wooden
Wonder'' Mosquito aircraft in World War II and the Comet jetliner
shortly after the war, has died, family death notices said Tuesday.
He was 86.
   After the war, Bishop designed other military and civil aircraft
and the world's first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, which fell
victim to the hitherto unknown phenomenon of metal fatigue.
   Bishop joined the De Havilland company when he was 18 and worked
his way through the metal, fitting and engine workshops before
entering the drawing office in 1923.
   The Air Ministry rejected his idea for a fast bomber built of
wood a year before the war began. But Bishop and the company built
it anyway and the DH-98 Mosquito became one of the most versatile
military planes ever built for day and night fighting, bombing and
photographic reconnaissance.
   It was made of two layers of plywood sandwiching a layer of balsa
wood. Twin Rolls-Royce Merlin engines powered the Mosquito to 380
mph, faster than any enemy fighter so it did not have to carry
defensive guns or armor. Later versions sped at 425 mph and doubled
the bomb load to 4,000 pounds.
   Mosquito night fighters destroyed 600 German planes over Germany,
a like number of German V-1 flying bombs over England, and marked
targets for night bombing of Germany by laying flares.
   The most spectacular Mosquito raids were the September 1942
attack that destroyed the headquarters of the Gestapo secret police
in Oslo, Norway, and the February 1944 attack on Amiens jail in
France which helped 258 French Resistance fighters escape.
   An obituary in London's Daily Telegraph said Bishop got the idea
for the Mosquito when he saw a stuffed pike in a glass case and
penciled a similar, streamlined outline on the back of an envelope.
   The fish had been caught before World War I by Sir Winston
Churchill, Britain's leader in World War II.
   Bishop lived at Harpenden, 25 miles northwest of London and is
survived by his wife, Nora, and two sons.
   Family notices said he died Sunday, but gave no cause or place of
death.

   A private school bus taking students home from
their first day in summer school collided with a truck Monday,
killing one girl and injuring nine others.
   The bus was carrying seventh- and eighth-grade girls attending
summer classes at the Chinquapin School, a private preparatory
school in the small community of Highlands, school secretary Debra
Hicks said.
   One girl was killed in the accident at an intersection at about
4:30 p.m., but Ms. Hicks did not know her age.
   Emergency medical service officials said the injured _ nine
students and three adults _ were transferred to several area
hospitals. The drivers of the school bus, the truck and a motorcycle
also were hospitalized.
   Three girls were in stable condition at San Jacinto Methodist
Hospital in nearby Baytown, hospital spokeswoman Jeanni Pruitt said.
Two other girls taken to Sunbelt Regional Medical Center did not
have serious injuries, a hospital official said.
   Three girls were taken to Doctors Hospital-East Loop, but
hospital officials could not release any information about their
conditions.
   Three adults and one student were taken to Hermann Hospital. Two
of the adults and the girl were in stable condition, and one adult
was in guarded condition, hospital spokeswoman Katherine Byard said.
   Harris County Sheriff's officials did not have any immediate
details about what caused the multi-vehicle accident.

   The Soviet Union has been authorized to buy up
to 75,000 metric tons of surplus U.S. butter at prices to be
negotiated, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced Monday.
   ``The United States has a large supply of surplus butter and we
can sell competitively on the world market,'' Yeutter said.
   An estimated 135,000 to 140,000 tons of butter will be in the
surplus inventory held by the Agriculture Department's Commodity
Credit Corp. by Sept. 30, up from 73,165 tons on Sept. 30, 1988, he
said.
   The 1985 farm law mandated sales of 150,000 tons of dairy
products annually through Sept. 30, 1990.
   Butter, cheese and non-fat dry milk are bought by the CCC to
support the price of milk paid to dairy farmers. Unless the products
are sold periodically, huge inventories can build up.
   Although no price level was mentioned in the announcement, recent
CCC report indicate that taxpayers have about $1.47 per pound
invested in the surplus butter, or around $3,241 per metric ton,
allowing for 2,205 pounds per ton.
   The administration has been under pressure from some members of
Congress and trade interests to sell soybean oil as well as butter
to the Soviets. Advocates want the vegetable oil to be included
under the Export Enhancement Program for sale to Moscow at
subsidized prices.
   However, no mention was made of possible soybean sales to the
Soviet Union.

   Sergei Grigoryants, a Soviet magazine
publisher once imprisoned as a dissident, received the International
Federation of Newspaper Publishers 1989 ``Golden Pen of Freedom''
award on Monday.
   ``A few years ago the Golden Pen of Freedom had no place in the
USSR'' and countless other places, Grigoryants said, speaking
through an interpreter.
   ``Today we see the great dragon being defeated not only by the
force of the spear, but also by the healing injection of the free
word,'' he told about 300 at the World Congress of Newspaper
Publishers.
   Grigoryants, 48, founded the independent Soviet magazine
``Glasnost'' in 1987. He began publication soon after his release
from a Soviet labor camp where he had been imprisoned in 1983 for
publishing ``Bulletin V,'' an underground newspaper on human rights.
   Since starting ``Glasnost,'' Grigoryants has been harassed and
his editing and publishing equipment destroyed for writing stories
about the KGB, immigration rules and the destruction of judicial
archives, said Professor Lord McGregor of Durris, England, and
chairman of the committee that searches for Golden Pen honorees.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has described ``Glasnost'' as
a ``parasite funded by the West,'' McGregor said.
   Grigoryants responded, ``A really free press is not popular with
anyone in power, not only in the Soviet Union but in the West, too.''
   The Golden Pen award was created in 1961 to recognize the
oustanding actions of an individual, group or institution in favor
of freedom of the press. In 1988, the award was given posthumously
to Naji El-Ali, a Lebanese cartoonist.
   The World Congress of Newspaper Publishers continues through
Wednesday in New Orleans.

<TEXT>
   Maximilian Robespierre's own draft of the French
constitution and one of the guillotines he kept busy until he lost
his own head in 1794 were sold at auction Monday.
   The constitution sold for $44,000 and auctioneer Jacques Tajan
said it would be placed in the permanent collection of the National
Assembly Library.
   The last item in the sale, held at the Drouot auction house in
central Paris, was a guillotine dating to revolutionary France. A
German collector who asked to remain anonymous bought it for
$40,000, the auction house reported.
   The 57-page manuscript of the draft of the constitution contains
notes by Robespierre on aspects of the first constitution prepared
in 1791 by the National Assembly.
   Other items auctioned included documents from the bloody events
of 200 years ago. They included papers relating to King Louis XVI's
trial that led to his conviction for treason and subsequent
execution at the guillotine.
   The guillotine, whose use was advocated by Dr. Joseph Guillotin
during the French Revolution in preference to less humane methods,
was first used in 1792.
   A two-page, handwritten letter dated Oct. 10, 1789, from Queen
Marie Antoinette to the Austrian ambassador in Paris was bought
$19,000 by a French collector who also asked to remain anonymous.
   It describes the queen's departure from the palace at Versailles
four days earlier and declares her belief that the ``bourgeoisie and
the people,'' were on her side and would prevail even though they
were weaker than the revolutionaries.
   ``All the texts of Marie-Antoinette's correspondance are in the
archives in Vienna, but most of the original letters have
disappeared,'' said Jean Chalon, author of a recent biography of the
Austrian-born queen.
   ``This is a rare look at Marie-Antoinette, and you can be sure
it's an original because it's full of spelling mistakes.''
   Known as the ``Incorruptible,'' Robespierre sent some 17,000
people to the guillotine during the year-long Reign of Terror that
came to a climax with his own beheading in 1794.
   His notes in the constitutional draft show that he opposed
creation of a legislative branch composed of representatives elected
by the people.
   His notes also oppose the National Assembly's plan to limit the
vote to those paying taxes worth three days' work.
   ``Wealth corrupts more than poverty,'' Robespierre wrote in the
margin of the text. ``Millionaires are the ones who should be
excluded'' from voting.

<HEAD>Friends of Dead Driver Protest Pizza Chain's Delivery Promise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc.'s 30-minute delivery
guarantee is being challenged by area residents after an accident
that claimed a 17-year-old's life, the latest in a series of wrecks
involving company drivers.
   The dead youth's relatives and friends are circulating petitions
asking Indiana's congressional members to seek federal restrictions
on Domino's promise to deliver an order within 30 minutes or cut the
price by $3.
   ``I don't want another mother to have to go through what I've
been through,'' said Suzanne Boutros, whose son, Jesse Colson, died
June 3 while speeding to deliver a pizza for a Domino's store in
Mooresville almost 18 miles southwest of here.
   The Plainfield youth's small pickup truck went off a
rain-slickened road and hit a utility pole two miles east of
Mooresville, authorities said.
   ``It's awful,'' Ms. Boutros said Sunday. ``But there are still
thousands of kids all across the country out there doing the same
thing.''
   She called Domino's guarantee ``an invitation to break the law,
to speed.''
   Domino's officials said its drivers do not have to speed to make
the deadline.
   The night before Colson's death, a Domino's deliveryman in
Shelbyville nearly 30 miles southeast of Indianapolis was involved
in an accident near there, but no one was seriously injured.
   Three Domino's drivers were involved in traffic accidents last
year in Hendricks County alone, said authorities in Colson's home
county.
   Domino's does not keep accident totals, spokesman Ron Hingst said
from the 5,000-store chain's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Colson, a Plainfield High School junior, had worked as a
deliveryman since January.
   ``We had discussed it,'' Ms. Boutros said. ``He didn't like it; I
didn't like it.''
   Colson's girlfriend, Kelly Lowe, 17, who also works for Domino's,
said workers who tallied the largest number of late deliveries
received a badge that read ``King of Lates.'' Colson had never
received the badge.
   ``He didn't like to have late pizzas,'' Miss Lowe said. ``He
always talked about how he never had any lates.''
   Domino's maintains its pizzas are made in 10 to 15 minutes,
allowing ample time for orders to be delivered.
   ``If people would go visit our stores and see this system in
action, I think it would help them understand. That's where the
speed of our system is,'' said Hingst.
   Steve Osmun, who owns the Mooresville franchise, said he urges
employees to offer the discount before endangering their lives.
   ``We don't advocate anyone speeding,'' Osmun said.
   He said he was unaware of the ``King of Lates'' badge and does
not approve of it.

   In the scarred, denuded hills northwest
of Hanoi, Vietnam is waging another war, one scientists say may
prove as crucial to its survival as those against the French and
Americans.
   Over large tracts of Vinh Phu, experimental efforts are under way
to regenerate forests that once covered most of the hilly province
and to persuade farmers to mix cash crops with trees that bind and
fertilize the soil.
   The lessons learned may help attain a national objective:
increase tree cover in the next few decades from the current 20
percent to 50 percent. Vo Quy, the country's leading
conservationist, says while the plan may be over-ambitious, not
succeeding could spell disaster.
   According to Quy, a biologist who helped develop Vietnam strategy
for national conservation, forces threatening the underpinnings of
Vietnam are at work.

   A Maryland woman dubbed ``Robin HUD'' by
federal investigators claims she embezzled as much as $5.5 million
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to give to the
poor.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was described Sunday as being ``very
upset'' by the losses, which according to The Washington Post could
reach $10 million in the Washington field office alone because of
extraordinarily lax bookkeeping involving foreclosure sales of
government property.
   Kemp ordered HUD Inspector General Paul Adams to conduct an
immediate investigation of the alleged embezzlement in the
Washington office and on Friday he placed four employees on leave
without pay, Frank Keating, HUD's general counsel-designee, said in
an interview Sunday.
   The New York Times said investigations also were under way in HUD
offices in Denver, Houston, New Orleans and Los Angeles about
million-dollar diversions.

   President Bush's proposed savings and loan
bailout plan moves to the House floor this week with members of his
own party attacking its key reform and Democrats trying to use it to
create new housing subsidies.
   With the S&amp;L crisis already expected to cost taxpayers $600 to
$1,000 for every man, woman and child in the country, what has been
a largely harmonious effort so far could deteriorate into partisan
name-calling.
   Omens of what might occur when debate begins Wednesday were
evident last week in several confrontations between Democrats and
Republicans, Sun Belt and Frost Belt lawmakers, and populists and

   Labor organizers say more and more doctors are
joining the ranks of several unions nationwide _ a trend that could
change the rules by which medical professionals play.
   Before doctors take the lives of others into their hands, they
take a Hippocratic oath to act ``with purity and with holiness,'' a
mandate that raises ethical questions about whether a doctors'
walkout would, say, stop a parent from rushing a sick child past
pickets and into an emergency room.
   Still, does that oath deprive doctors of the right to protect
their own interests, financial and otherwise?
   Union proponents and medical ethicists say no _ up to a point.
   Dr. Sanford A. Marcus, president of the Union of American
Physicians and Dentists, said his Oakland, Calif.-based consortium
has 50,000 members and is growing. He said members, affiliated
through a number of offshoots around the country, are working
together to advocate the rights of both physicians and their
patients.

   Actress Theresa Saldana's plea helped keep
the man who almost killed her locked up, but, despite public

   Arthur Richard Jackson, who was set for a parole hearing
Thursday, instead was charged with eight felony counts for allegedly
issuing threats to kill Saldana. Conviction could keep him in prison
for seven more years, Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner says.
   But the ones released form a rogues' gallery familiar to most

   There's Lawrence Singleton, who raped a hitchhiker and then

<HEAD>Rachel Ward Picks Her Roles With Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the world's rare beauties, Rachel Ward
could be amply employed in American-made films. Instead, she opts to
live in Australia with husband Bryan Brown and two daughters and
choose her roles with care.
   ``I have been working but not in Hollywood,'' she says. ``I've
been working in Australia and England quite a bit, doing things that
may have a smaller profile but stimulate me more than the stuff I
was doing in Hollywood.
   ``I guess I would have to live here if I wanted to work here.
Also, I'm not American, as you've probably assessed by now. That
narrows the field for things that I'm right for.
   ``Part of the frustration I felt in working here was having to
homogenize myself. I was asked to lessen my accent and make it more
mid-Atlantic. They still wanted to keep me English, but not so that
it was not understandable. I think that stifles one's own
uniqueness, in a sense. Being able to do Australian and English
products sort of released me for that a bit. I was able to use my
own expression.''
   One of her English films is the current release, ``How to Get
Ahead in Advertising.'' It comes from George Harrison's Handmade
Films, written and directed by Bruce Robinson, who wrote ``The
Killing Fields'' and made his directorial debut with the critically
acclaimed ``Withnail and I.''
   ``How to Get Ahead in Advertising'' tells of a top advertising
man (Richard E. Grant) who suddenly rebels and leads a crusade
against what he considers the manipulation of the ad world.
   ``I've done comedy before, like `Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,' but
nothing so bold and original,'' said the actress, who plays the ad
man's bewildered wife.
   ``I think the advertising business is used as a sort of metaphor
for what Bruce is raging about in the film. There is a number of
occupations you could have used that would have said the same thing.
It could be part of the show business scene as well.''
   Ward remembers that seeing ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid''
as an English schoolgirl started her toward an acting career. ``I
really wanted to be Katharine Ross,'' she said. ``That was a world
that appealed to my sense of romance.''
   She became a top model in London, then came to New York at 18 to
become Lincoln-Mercury's Cougar Girl, Revlon's Scoundrel girl and
Joe Namath's date for Brut. Burt Reynolds happened to see her in a
Time magazine ad and chose her for a role in ``Sharkey's Machine.''
Then came her Hollywood period: ``Against All Odds'' with Jeff
Bridges, ``Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid.''
   Her most prominent role came as the heroine of ``The Thorn
Birds.'' In the miniseries she rejected Bryan Brown as a suitor but
accepted him in real life. She married the Australian actor in
Chipping Norton, England, six years ago. They now have two
daughters, Rosie and Matilda, and make their home in Sydney.
   ``The international film scene isn't everything,'' she remarked.
``There are very interesting things going on in Australia and
Britain, things as worth while or more so to be involved in than in
Hollywood.
   ``We live a low-key life in Australia, spending much of it on a
farm in the outback of New South Wales. I do whatever you do on a
working farm: milk cows, pluck chickens, mend fences, that kind of
thing.''

   Citizens in the 12 nations of the
European Economic Community are electing a new European Parliament
and for the first time the candidates they choose will have real
power.
   In the past few years, the Strasbourg-based parliament has been
rapidly shedding the image of an unwieldy, overfunded talking shop.
Now it will be an institution with more power and responsibility
than at any time in its 37-year history.
   The voting is today (June 15) in five countries and on Sunday,
June 18, in the remaining seven. Results are expected June 19.
   Yet old impressions die hard. Polls and other predictions in
several countries, including West Germany and France, indicate
little public interest in the ``European elections'' that seat a new
parliament every five years.
   In some countries, including Italy, France and Spain, what
interest the elections have generated is related more to the
ramifications for domestic politics of which candidates win.
   The danger for the parliament is that a low turnout among the 120
million eligible voters could undermine the legitimacy of the
institution just as it is gaining more power. Parliament members
have long asserted that they speak most directly for the 360 million
citizens of the European Economic Community, and therefore should be
a far more central element in community decision-making.
   Among the results likely are an increase in the number of Greens,
the environment-based political movements, in the parliament and a
falloff in members from extreme right-wing parties. These are likely
to have little overall effect, however, on the parliament, which has
traditionally been somewhat left of center and is already
sympathetic to environmental concerns.
   The elections will be the third time that voters have directly
elected the parliament's 518 members. Until the first elections in
June 1979, the deputies were appointed by the governments of the
member states.
   The number of members each nation can send to the parliament
depends on its population. Britain, France, Germany and Italy each
have 81 seats. Luxembourg has just 6. Spain has 60, the Netherlands
25, Portugal, Belgium and Greece have 24 each, Denmark has 16 and
Ireland, 15.
   Within the parliament's huge, modernistic chamber in Strasbourg,
however, members neither sit nor vote by nationality. Instead, they
work in eight political groupings, each with members from several
nations, that cover the West European ideological spectrum. There is
also a small group of independents.
   Those elected will have many powers to shape the legislation that
will rule the single European market the community plans to initiate
in 1992. The parliament's powers were significantly expanded in 1987.
   The parliament, however, is seeking an even bigger say in EEC
affairs. The most powerful body at present in the EEC is the Council
of Ministers, made up of delegates from each member government.
Advocates of more parliamentary power say the domination of
community decision-making by a handful of people responsible only to
their own governments is a disservice to the EEC's overall citizenry.
   This ``democratic gap'' will be a hot issue in the parliament's
next five-year term, says Gijs De Vries, a parliament member from
the Netherlands who has been particularly active in the body's
operations.
   Other key issues, he says, will include details of how the single
market will work, environmental, consumer and social issues and the
EEC's relationship with the rest of the world.
   The parliament has a crucial role in this last area because trade
cooperation agreements cannot take effect until a majority of the
parliament approves them. The parliament also must sign off on
applications from nations that want to join the community.
   The parliament also issues resolutions on current affairs, a
large number of which reflect concern with human rights abuses and
environmental issues.
   The voting begins June 15 in Britain, Denmark, Ireland, the
Netherlands and Spain. Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg,
Portugal and West Germany follow on Sunday, June 18.

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republicans' split political personality is
showing.
   It may be wearing a bit thin, but it's there. President Bush
remains the innocent bystander, cast as the man on the high road,
chiding his own low-road lieutenants for their excesses.
   But there was an echo of Bush's own 1988 presidential campaign in
a disowned GOP attack on Tom Foley, the new speaker of the House.
   That echo was in the premise, not the particulars, of a
Republican National Committee memo attacking Foley. The memo was
headed: ``Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet.''
   Liberal, the ``L word,'' was fashioned into a political curse by
the Bush campaign. It was used, effectively, to make the case that
Gov. Michael Dukakis was not moderate Democratic problem solver but
a knee-jerk liberal.
   That was the theme of the attack on Foley, but it added innuendo,
comparing the new speaker's record with that of an openly homosexual
congressman, saying Foley should ``come out of the liberal closet.''
   The author was a Republican publicist who worked for the 1988
Bush campaign as a deputy press secretary. The memo cost him his job.
   Lee Atwater, then campaign manager, now chairman of the
Republican committee, shaped the attack strategy of the Bush
campaign. While the White House says the season for that is gone,
negative campaigning apparently is easier to turn on than turn off.
   Atwater said he did not know about the memo and would not have
issued it if he had.
   A day earlier, before Bush and other Republican leaders had
denounced the attack on Foley, Atwater called the memo factually
correct and no big deal anyhow.
   ``It was disgusting ... it's against everything I've tried to
stand for in political life,'' Bush said at his press conference
Thursday night. ``But I discussed that matter with Lee Atwater and
he looked me right in the eye and said he did not know about it. He
moved promptly to remove the person that did know about it, so I
accept that.''
   The ousted Republican was Mark Goodin, communications director
for the national commitee, who wrote a memo addressed to
``Republican leaders,'' noting Foley's high approval rating by
Americans for Democratic Action, his opposition to capital
punishment and his votes against aid to the Nicaraguan contras.
   It went out the day before Foley was installed as speaker of the
House to succeed the resigned Jim Wright.
   The Goodin attack painted Foley as a doctrinaire liberal by
likening the speaker's record to that of Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
a liberal who also is gay. It was Frank who first put the public
spotlight on the implications of the memo, saying it was part of a
GOP campaign of rumor against Democrats.
   Republicans in Congress and at the White House disowned the memo
and the author. Foley called it a cheap smear. But he said Atwater
had telephoned him to apologize and that he considered the matter
closed.
   During the campaign that won him the office, Bush repeatedly
denied that his was a negative campaign, although that's where the
push against Dukakis was. ``All that's left is this daily whining
about a negative campaign,'' Bush said near the end. ``Don't listen
to the crying on the far left.''
   But Bush has a different role now. He needs no wars with
Democrats, especially with a new and popular speaker of the House.
He needs Democratic votes in order to govern.
   ``The president feels he set a new tone when he took office, and
that tone should be continued,'' said White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. ``And that tone is one of bipartisanship.''
   But that message isn't reaching every corner of the party. After
years of getting along and losing, minority Republicans in the House
are trying a more aggressive strategy of political attack. That
isn't about to change _ they're just getting started.
   That points to more tough talk and tough politics.
   As he became speaker, Foley said he hoped to see a change in the
atmosphere in Congress. Bush said he'd like to change that, too,
although he insisted it wasn't caused by Republicans any more than
Democrats.
   ``The ugliness of this climate is bad and I don't like it and I'd
like to think that I could help,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Kathleen Quinlan Is Star of Cable Movie `Trapped'</HEAD>

   A decision to work late in her high-rise
office building put Kathleen Quinlan's character in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
   In the USA Network movie ``Trapped,'' Quinlan plays Marianne, the
building manager, who is caught inside the building, first with a
thief, then with a killer.
   ``What I like about it is that she's not a woman who thinks of
herself as a fighter,'' said Quinlan, ``but when she finds herself
in this situation she has to pull herself together and fight her way
through it.
   Quinlan calls ``Trapped'' a female version of ``Die Hard,'' the
feature film starring Bruce Willis, which was set in a Los Angeles
high-rise as the terrorists' robbery-hostage drama unfolded.
   ``This is about a man whose family has been killed by toxic waste
dumped by a huge corporation,'' she said. ``When he hits the
building, an industrial thief and myself are trapped in the
building. We become the target. So it becomes more one-on-one than
`Die Hard.'
   ``Usually this kind of movie is male-oriented. I loved doing all
the physical stuff. I did all the stunts except going off the
building. I'm a jock so if I get a role where I can act and do
something physical I'll take it. The character of Marianne wasn't
written in depth, so I put myself in her shoes and developed the
character myself. It was all taken very seriously, but it's really a
fun, entertainment piece.''
   The movie, which also stars Bruce Abbott as John, the thief, has
its premiere Wednesday on the USA Network. It was written by Fred
Walton, who directed it on location in Dallas.
   ``We filmed in Dallas because they have some incredible buildings
there,'' Quinlan said. ``We shot it indoors at night. I'm a very
outdoor person, and I'm not a night person. This girl likes to close
her eyes at 10:30. We worked from 6 at night until 6 in the morning.
It has a lot of action so you really had to be on your toes.
   ``I'm a former gymnast and so is Bruce Abbott and it really
helped. We did one stunt with an explosion. Trust me, if I'd known
it was going to explode so big I wouldn't have done it. Our stunt
people were very good, and they had to test me before letting me do
the stunts.''
   Quinlan recently completed a stage role in ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuse'' at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.
   She has been in such movies as ``American Graffiti,''
``Lifeguard,'' ``I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,'' ``The
Promise,'' ``The Runner Stumbles,'' ``Sunday Lovers,'' ``Hanky
Panky'' and ``Sunset.'' Among her TV movies are ``She's in the Army
Now,'' ``When She Says No,'' ``Blackout'' and ``Children of the
Night.''
   Quinlan grew up in the San Francisco suburb of Mill Valley, where
she was a gymnast and diver. She made her film debut in ``One Is a
Lonely Number'' doubling for Trish Van Devere in a high dive
sequence.
   ``I was 17 at the time,'' she said. ``They came to our high
school and looked at the diving team. I did `American Graffiti'
because they had a cattle call audition at our school. I went in and
read for a part, never thinking in a million years I'd do any acting.
   ``I had a dream of going to the Olympics. It took me a long time
to get over it. But I got to keep my athletics to myself. In college
I was running back and forth between acting and athletic training.
My coach said I had to make a choice and get my priorities straight.
Finally, I chose acting.''

<HEAD>JVC Jazz Festival Already a Hit With Ticket Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jazz lovers have to move fast this year if they
want to see their favorite musicians at the JVC Jazz Festival.
Concerts, including Miles Davis and Ella Fitzgerald, are selling out
ahead of time.
   ``I guess interest in jazz must be growing. I don't know if it's
economic. There's interest in just about every concert we have,''
says festival promoter George Wein about the music fest that plays
New York's concert halls and other outdoors venues in the area from
June 23 to July 1.
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' he said in an interview.
``We're two times ahead of where we were last year (in ticket
sales). It looks like we're going to break all records this year. We
did break all records in the Jazz and Heritage Festival in New
Orleans.''
   First to approach sellout status were the earlier of two concerts
by trumpeters Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis on opening night at
Avery Fisher Hall, and Ella Fitzgerald's concert with guitarist Joe
Pass as guest at Carnegie Hall on June 25.
   Last year's jazz festival tickets were about 10 percent above
sales from the previous year. The 1988 festival was under the
umbrella of the June 11 to July 11 First New York International
Festival of the Arts. Wein said he didn't know how much effect the
larger festival had on jazz-festival attendance.
   Other concerts this year in which tickets are selling early and
briskly include Lionel Hampton's and George Benson's tribute to
Benny Goodman at Carnegie on June 24; the first of two shows by Ray
Charles and the Temptations on June 28 at Avery Fisher; and ``An
Evening of Jazz and the American Song'' at Carnegie, a benefit for
the Duke Ellington Memorial Fund starring Rosemary Clooney, Dave
Brubeck, Marian McPartland, Phil Woods, Ruby Braff and Dave
Frishberg with Bobby Short as host.
   A children's program, ``Coolin' It With Snoopy,'' on the
afternoon of June 24, is also selling well, as is the final night's
``Clark Terry and Friends,'' with some 30 musicians including Oscar
Peterson.
   ``He called people and they came for him,'' Wein said. ``We never
could have afforded to get them all. It's going to be an exciting
evening.'' Both ``Snoopy'' and ``Friends'' will be at Town Hall.
   As for jazz musicians who are just beginning to establish
themselves, the JVC festival has something to offer.
   ``New people have never seemed to catch with the public in New
York. We're very concerned that that type of music have its place on
our festival,'' said Wein.
   This year Lincoln Center is helping Wein present avant-garde jazz
at five ``Knitting Factory Goes Uptown'' concerts in 1,096-seat
Alice Tully Hall. The Knitting Factory is a small club on Houston
Street showcasing the cutting edge in jazz. It has an even smaller
``Knot Room,'' seating 40, in what used to be a basement kitchen,
for even more far-out experimentation.
   Other concerts in this year's festival include Joe Williams
celebrating his 70th birthday, the Benny Carter Quartet with Art
Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Dizzy Gillespie headlining a ``Bebop
Revisited'' concert, Spyro Gyra and Marcus Roberts, a 20th
anniversary tour performance by Gregg Allman with Dickey Betts, a
Latin Jazz Jam and a night of African jazz, which is a festival
first.
   The Japanese Victor Co., an electronics firm, is sponsoring the
festival for the third year.
   Wein is annually involved with some 30 jazz festivals. The
Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island, from which the New York
festival sprouted, began in 1954.
   ``I was playing seven nights a week while I was still going to
Boston University,'' said Wein, who started as a jazz pianist. ``I
knew I was going to do something with music, I didn't know what. I
found out I had a good head for promoting. That's how it all
developed.''
   At first, he didn't play piano at his festivals. ``I'm playing
more now than I ever played before. I'm playing better than I ever
played before. And I find my playing is more accepted now.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Some 8 million Americans claim to know from
experience what it feels like to die. They tell of disembodied
travels through dark tunnels at immeasurable speeds; of being bathed
in a brilliant white or golden light that conveys feelings of peace
and love; of seeing the minutiae of their lives replayed. Are these
merely hallucinations induced by drugs or anesthesia? Perhaps. But
most of the people who have had a near-death experience are never
the same again.

   It might have been the effects of
painkillers that changed Steve Price's life. It might have been a
surge of bioenergy that some mystics believe lies dormant in us all.
   Then again, it maatever it was that kept Price from firing his gun
again after
he was nearly killed by a mortar fragment in Vietnam in 1965 has
never been measured or analyzed or scanned. No one knows, so any
theory could apply.
   Regardless, Price's near-death experience continues to shape his
life years later. The same holds true for many of the 8 million
Americans who claim to know from experience what it feels like to
die.
   Nine years after her near-death experience, Barbara Harris walked
away from her husband and three kids. She couldn't reconcile her
privileged lifestyle with a need to help others that was born when
her life flashed before her, revealing each ripple her actions had
caused in the lives of others.
   Just as many people can't remember their dreams, the majority of
people who come close to death don't recall it. But the 25 percent
to 30 percent who do invariably give similar descriptions.
   Near-death experiencers tell of disembodied travels through dark
tunnels at immeasurable speeds; of being bathed in a brilliant white
or golden light that conveys feelings of peace and love far beyond
any earthly emotion; of seeing the minutiae of their lives replayed
for their edification.
   Some report joyful reunions with deceased loved ones who
communicate telepathically. Others tell of encounters with a divine
presence or energy force they describe as the source of all love; of
comprehending, for a mind-reeling instant, the secrets of the
universe; of the anguish and sorrow that accompanies their reluctant
return to the living.
   The descriptions are similar in India and Japan, with cultural
variations; a Buddhist won't see Jesus, for example. Psychoanalyst
Karl Jung had a near-death experience in the mid-1940s. English
philosopher Sir Alfred J. Ayer, one of the world's prominent
atheists, had one just last year. (Ayer wrote that it ``slightly
weakened my conviction that my genuine death, which is due fairly
soon, will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will
be.'')
   The scientists who study NDEs haven't been lucky enough to be
around during one, so they can only chronicle the effects. NDErs
invariably profess to have lost all fear of death. Many feel angry
and disappointed at being revived. ``I felt so restricted, so
trapped in this body,'' says Al Sullivan of East Hartford, whose NDE
came during his heart surgery last year.
   But even those whose NDEs resulted from suicide attempts seldom
try to return. ``The things that made people suicidal before are no
longer meaningful,'' says Bruce Greyson, a psychiatry professor at
the University of Connecticut Medical Center who has interviewed
thousands of NDErs over 15 years of study. ``People see their role
in the universe-at-large. They see why they're here _ to take care
of a family, raise a child, write a book.''
   Virtually all NDErs emerge with an unwavering belief in a higher
power, regardless of their prior convictions. At the same time,
organized religion tends to lose its meaning.
   ``The God I met loves everyone. It's generic,'' says Kate
Valentine of Oxford, Conn. A Catholic before her 1981 NDE, ``I've
become very unreligious.''
   Many adopt less materialistic lives, and a large number change
careers, often becoming nurses, volunteers or social workers.
   ``If a person was very materialistic before, his whole life may
be disrupted,'' Greyson says. ``Relationships often break up,
especially if they were based on materialism and power. For a
successful businessman, that could mean not being able to return to
the job.''
   Kenneth Ring, a professor of psychology at the University of
Connecticut at Storrs, has studied NDEs since 1976 and has written
two books on the subject. ``People become life appreciators,'' he
says. ``They don't care about success, fame or fortune. They want to
sail their boats on Long Island Sound.''
   NDErs often develop a deep hunger for spiritual understanding,
along with a fervent desire to see world conditions improve. They
tend to become more self-confident and less passive. Often, they
like themselves better.
   ``I do miss financial security, but what really matters is
love,'' says Harris, 46, whose NDE followed back surgery in 1975.
Complications set in, her condition deteriorated, and Harris passed
out in her bed.
   She came to in the hospital corridor.
   ``I turned to go back into my room _ my first thought was that
I'd get in trouble for being out of bed. Then I discovered I was
looking directly into a speaker that was mounted on the ceiling.''
   Confusion _ ``If I'm here, what's in the bed?'' _ soon gave way
to pure sensation. ``I felt my grandmother holding me, cradling
me.'' The feeling was so soothing, so familiar, that moments passed
before Harris remembered her grandmother had been dead for 10 years.
   She returned to her body, but a week later, still bedridden, she
had a vision. ``I drew out of my body and relived my life _ all 32
years _ in an instant.
   ``I heard myself saying, `No wonder. No wonder you are the way
you are.' I felt all the slates being wiped clean. I understood the
reasons behind everything that had ever happened to me. It was the
most healing therapy there could be.''
   The Barbara Harris who entered the hospital had filled her days
with garden club meetings. The one who left felt drawn to hospital
emergency rooms. She became a hospital volunteer, then a respiratory
and massage therapist.
   Ultimately, Harris packed her clothes and her stereo into her
Saab and drove away from her home, backyard pool and private plane.
Now she rents a tiny apartment in Newington, which she shares with
two of her children.
   She addresses nurses, clergy and others who counsel the dying,
and volunteers as Greyson's research assistant. She also leads
monthly meetings of one of the two dozen NDE support groups that
have sprung up around the nation.
   An NDEr's need for support is enormous, says Harris. ``You can't
stay the way you are, and your loved ones don't want you to change.''

   Many medical professionals dismiss NDEs as drug- or
anesthesia-induced hallucinations. Others attribute them to lack of
oxygen to the brain, or to the release of some stress-related
chemicals.
   ``Death is a state. Dying is a process,'' says debunker Richard
Blacher, a psychiatry professor at Tufts University and the New
England Medical Center Hospital. Blacher favors the anesthesia
explanation and says those who claim to have died are making an
error in logic.
   ``Driving to New York City is not the same as New York City,'' he
says. ``You're not going to get a taste of New York by driving
there.''
   While the argument continues, better resuscitation techniques and
new medical procedures are making close calls with death
increasingly common. A 1982 Gallup poll that reported 8 million
adult American NDErs also called that a conservative estimate. As
the numbers grow, so does the conviction among a handful of
scientists that near-death experiences warrant serious study.
   ``Our understanding of death has a tremendous impact on how we
treat people who are dealing with death, people who are suicidal,
people who are facing their own deaths or grieving the deaths of
loved ones,'' says Greyson, research director of The International
Association of Near-Death Studies, a 700-member non-profit group
that spreads information, sponsors research and provides support
services.
   Though poor proof of an afterlife, NDEs are powerful catalysts
for change, says Greyson, who has interviewed thousands of NDErs,
including a former Mafia hit man who now counsels spouse abusers in
Ohio; a respected college professor who quit his job to hitchhike
cross-country; a laborer with a high school education who immersed
himself in quantum physics after waking up one night and blurting
out the word ``quantum.'' Neither he nor his wife knew what it meant.
   Just as radical as some NDErs' transformations are the hypotheses
posed to explain them.
   Kundalini _ Sanskrit for ``coiled up'' _ refers to a subtle form
of bioenergy said to lie dormant at the base of the spine. When
activated, the energy travels through channels _ chakras _ in the
body, resulting in physical and psychological fireworks. Kundalini
theorists believe such awakenings are capable of catapulting
individuals into states of higher consciousness similar to NDEs and
with equally profound effects.
   Kundalini awakenings achieved through spiritual disciplines such
as yoga and meditation can cause transformations virtually
indistinguishable from those of near-death experiencers. The fact
that such parallels exist doesn't prove a common cause, Ring says,
though ``it does at least suggest the possibility that there may be
a general biological process that underlies them both.''
   If so, the seeming profusion of NDEs in recent years could
represent an evolutionary mechanism, some scientists have suggested,
designed to propel all of humanity toward higher consciousness.
   Whatever the cause, there's no denying the effect, Ring says.
``The person you become is really different. The person you were is
lost.''
   Steve Price of Killingworth was nearly killed when a mortar
fragment pierced his lung near Da Nang. A one-time schoolyard bully,
``I've become so sensitive that when other people hurt, I can feel
it. I talk to people about metaphysical things. Before, I would've
made fun of them.''
   A thickset man whose forearms are mapped with dark tattoos, Price
still gets teary as he recalls the summer night he relived his life
in an instant while waiting for a corpsman to reach him. Three days
later, the wounded Marine was wheeled into surgery at a field
hospital. But Price's consciousness took a detour and wound up on
the ceiling.
   ``A white light encompassed me. It took me in. I felt such warmth
and peace...I didn't say the word `God' for a long time, but now I
can say that the light was God. It was like the most loving mother
embracing her infant, only a million times more than that.''
   Recovered, Price returned to Vietnam. ``I led my unit. I did all
the things I was supposed to. But I never shot my gun. All I ever
wanted was to be a Marine. But I realized I couldn't do my job.''
   Instead, he joined the Connecticut National Guard ``because it
helps people instead of going to war.''
   ``Before my NDE, I was afraid to die, even though I was in the
business of killing,'' he says. ``I was so afraid to die that I
couldn't live.''
   NDErs don't just describe spiritual transformations. They also
talk of physical changes that Greyson and Ring are trying to measure.
   ``People often report that their vital signs change _ their
respiratory rates, their heart rates,'' Greyson says. ``Beyond that,
very great changes are reported in the ways they metabolize food and
drugs; in heightened sensitivities to light, sounds, smells, tastes.
Some can't tolerate perfume. Some can't drink alcohol.''
   Kate Valentine, a mother of three from Long Island, resigned
herself to die when a lung infection, circulation problems and an
irregular heartbeat followed her 1981 surgery for thyroid cancer.
``After being sick for a long time, you become physically and
emotionally whipped,'' she says.
   One night, her affairs in order, Valentine fell asleep in her bed
and awoke at the edge of a valley. ``The colors were incredible, as
if all my life I'd been looking at the wrong side of a tapestry,
then suddenly turned it over.''
   She saw no one, yet felt a loving, peaceful presence beside her.
``I wanted to go into the valley, but was told, telepathically,
`no.''' The next morning she awoke without pain. ``My heart wasn't
skipping beats or pounding or anything. My hands were normal _ they
had been almost black.''
   The ``new'' Kate Valentine directs a senior citizens center and
tries to help the troubled souls who cross her path with baffling
regularity. ``I could go on and on about the house cleaners who
never cleaned, the plumbers who never plumbed. People on the brink
of death, bereavement, tragedy somehow find their way to my door.''
   Paul Valentine, a general contractor, accompanies his wife to
Harris' support group meetings, and volunteers with her at a local
soup kitchen. They agree that Kate's NDE strengthened their marriage.
   For a long time, she says, she told no one, not even her husband,
about the experience that prompted her to change her life. ``Then a
friend of mine died of cancer. Suddenly, I needed to know why I
lived and she died.'' No longer able to deny her experience,
Valentine began trying to understand it.
   She's still working on it, like Steve Price, Barbara Harris and
countless others whose celestial wanderings took place in the blink
of an eye, but whose struggle to resume their earthly existence can
continue for a lifetime.
   Nearly a quarter-century after he almost died, Steve Price says
he's finally beginning to live. ``I've taken a long look at myself.
I'm just now seeing somebody in there who's worth saving.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With its economy thriving, Spain is eagerly
awaiting 1992 when Europe's Common Market nations drop their
internal trade barriers. Indeed, a gold-rush atmosphere prevails.
There are some misgivings about the direction the country is taking,
and progress has its price, but the pain in Spain is mainly on the
wane.

   Spain is discovering the price of progress.
   The Iberian country of 38.8 million people and 196,000 square
miles has transformed itself into a confident, Western democracy
since Generalissimo Francisco Franco's crippling 36-year
dictatorship.
   Today, Spain is Europe's star economic performer, eagerly
marching toward 1992, when the Common Market nations' internal trade
barriers are to fall.
   But there are signs of economic overheating and a new feeling of
political uncertainty as Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
faces challenges from left and right.
   Spain's new prosperity isn't felt by all, and there are worries
that the benefits of its economic transformation _ prosperity,
confidence, optimism _ are being accompanied by less favorable
changes. This is prompting some soul-searching questions among
Spaniards about the young democracy's direction.
   In the rush to modernize, Spaniards are polluting their
environment. Crime, much of it drug-related, is on the rise, and in
the capital women clutch their purses to prevent their snatching.
   But overriding the misgivings is a tremendous sense of vitality,
what some are calling a gold-rush feeling, as 1992 approaches.
   ``In one generation, you had people very scared about what was
going to happen to their futures and now I think there is a lot more
optimism,'' says Jorge Hay, a director of Banco Hispano Americano.
   For four years, growth has been spurred by low oil prices, strong
global economic expansion, agreed low wages, tight money and
restructuring to broaden the economic base. Major industries are
textiles, shoes, agriculture, tourism, cars, ships, machinery and
steel.
   ``We have in process an extraordinary acceleration of
modernization,'' Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga said in a recent
speech. ``The economy really has strong momentum.''
   Spain's economy is expected to be Europe's fastest-growing this
year with a 4.5 percent growth rate, after about 5 percent in the
last two years.
   Spain has come a long way from the old stereotype images of
Flamenco dancers and bullfights. Madrid has become a prosperous,
almost antiseptic-looking European capital.
   The fashion statement in the city today is black. The well-to-do
Spanish are a graceful, well-groomed people who like to be admired.
The long lunch, which begins after 2 p.m., is an enduring tradition.
Menus list an astonishing array of seafood.
   Once strongly Catholic, Spain has become increasingly secular.
The birth rate has fallen dramatically, to 1.5 children for every
woman from 2.8 in 1975. Divorce was legalized 10 years ago, abortion
in 1985. Young couples display a physical affection unheard of under
Franco.
   Another tradition that endures is the ``macho'' society.
   Few women hold positions of any power, and only one-third work,
the lowest rate in the Common Market. Families remain
male-dominated, although, incongruously, Spanish women have always
kept their maiden names and children are given both their parents
surnames.
   Spain's 1977 transition from isolationist dictatorship to
democracy was relatively smooth.
   Franco, who came into power after the 1936-1939 civil war that
claimed a million lives, died in 1975. His chosen successor, King
Juan Carlos I, facilitated the creation of a new constitution. The
restored monarch and his family remain highly popular.
   The constitution established 17 autonomous Spanish regions, some
with their own language besides the official Castilian. Regional
differences are most starkly illustrated by the 21-year Basque
separatist campaign, which has claimed more than 600 lives.
   Confidence in Spain's democracy was bolstered by the failure of a
1981 military coup, and Gonzalez was elected in 1982, backed by
Spain's most prominent union, the General Workers Union.
   Re-elected in 1986, Gonzalez must call the next election by June
1990, and not so long ago he seemed invincible. Now many Spaniards
are convinced the former lawyer will win, but that his Socialist
party will lose its parliamentary majority.
   The factious right has gotten more organized while 47-year-old
Gonzalez has clashed on the left with his main trade union ally,
General Workers Union chief Nicolas Redondo. Redondo supports the
drive for growth, but believes the wealth should be more widely
spread.
   Gonzalez' determination to dismantle Spain's tradition of
lifetime employment is unpopular. His relations with the unions
soured further when the 3 percent inflation forecast used to
negotiate wages agreement turned out to be way off the mark of 5.8
percent.

   The unions showed their power to paralyze the country on Dec. 14
when they persuaded 8 million Spaniards to join a general strike,
ostensibly to protest a youth employment scheme which they believed
threatened older workers.
   Critics complain that the Socialists' parliamentary majority has
bred arrogrance, and Gonzalez, who was a young, personable man of
the people when he was first elected, is now called a man of the
beautiful people.
   Madrid's landscape is littered with construction cranes and rents
have soared. Barcelona is preparing to host the Olympics in 1992 and
Seville is getting ready to throw the World's Fair that year, which
is also the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America for
the king and queen of Spain.
   The southern coasts are Europe's favorite Sun Belt, attracting
millions of vacationers and retirees.
   Spain's new entrepreneurial spirit is underscored by soaring
corporate profits and no fewer than four daily business newspapers.
   Attracted partly by its low wages, many foreign investors are
choosing Spain as the place to set up their European base ahead of
1992. Foreign investment soared 70 percent last year to 4.4 billion
dollars, bringing new jobs, training and advanced technology.
   ``We're very, very high on Spain,'' said Gary Genaw, managing
director of AT&amp;T Espana SA.
   The government has begun to dismantle Spain's traditional trade
protectionism and is collecting taxes more effectively. Madrid's
stock exchange is being deregulated and modernized, and the
government's ambitious privatization program recently led to the
sale of a 27 percent stake in the Repsol SA oil conglomerate for
$1.1 billion, the biggest-ever sale of stock in Spain.
   Spain joined the Common Market in 1986, and is readying for 1992
with optimism and vigor, determined ``to achieve some sort of parity
with the rest of Europe, financially and technologically,'' Genaw
says.
   Hay says, ``There is a wave of mergers and alliances and
acquisitions and all businesses are really reconsidering their
European strategy.''
   His bank has set up branches in Italy, West Germany and Belgium
and has launched an investment society in Portugal.
   The competition is going to be fierce because the foreign
investors who are coming to Spain want not just a foothold in Europe
but a share of the big Spanish market. Spaniards will have to buy a
lot of cars, refrigerators and TV sets before they match Europe's
average standard of living.
   ``We expect much more competition in practically everything in
every market and it makes you work harder,'' Hay says. ``It should
not be feared as long as you're in a growing market.''
   Not everybody agrees.
   ``It's going to be a crisis,'' says businessman Jose Luis
Rodriguez, worried that his own industry, aerospace products, won't
have room for all the new players.
   Now that the economy appears to be overheating, Spaniards are
worrying that they have had too much of a good thing.
   Inflation, although down from 14.5 percent in 1981, moved up to
6.2 percent in February, fueled by strong consumer spending. The
trade deficit grew 36 percent to $20.2 billion in 1988.
   The Bank of Spain has reacted by pushing up interest rates more
than 3 percentage points since September, bringing key rates to
about 14 percent.
   Although the boom has created many jobs, Spain's 18.5 percent
unemployment rate remains Europe's highest.
   There is unease over Spain's new free-market materialism, its
more conspicuous consumption, while Spain's per capita GDP, at about
$7,400, remains a quarter below the European average.
   ``From a social standpoint, people are questioning whether
individuals are partaking in the growth and enjoying in the
wealth,'' Genaw says.
   Juan Ignacio Palacio, an economics professor at the University of
Madrid, says, ``Now the middle classes are being squeezed. They feel
impotent.''
   There are other serious problems.
   Spaniards complain of poor judicial, medical and educational
systems. The weak infrastructure has been unable to match the pace
of economic growth, so traffic and telephones can be infuriating.
   The big question is: Is Spain gaining more than it's losing?
   ``That is something nobody is clear about,'' Palacio, the
professor says. ``Where do you find the equilibrium?''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ From Arizona to Massachusetts, private land
trusts are out to buy up natural habitats to save them from
developers, loggers and others who thirst to cash in trees and
swampland for money. But the private rescuers have limits. Consider
Michigan's 300-year-old Estivant pines.

   Preserving the wilderness once was
left largely to the government. Now, private trusts are buying up
land across the country in an effort to save the unplowed, the
undrained and the undeveloped.
   That much is obvious on the northern border of Michigan, on a
spur of land that locals call the beginning of the world and
tourists say is the end.
   Free-lance naturalist Jim Rooks, trudging deep into the stand of
towering Estivant pines on a recent day, suddenly stops and points
with the exuberance of a child. ``There!''
   He almost topples over as he arches back to gaze up at the giant
before him. It is a gargantuan white pine, 300 or more years old.
   Then Rooks points out 19 wide tabletops of cut stumps, now turned
black. He had come upon them in June 1987.
   ``Oh, my God, my heart,'' Rooks says, recalling the warm,
sickening day with its buzz of saws. ``Every tree was a drop of
blood.''
   Rooks and other Michigan environmentalists claim these giant pine
trees of the Keweenaw Peninsula by Lake Superior are the largest,
most extensive stand of unprotected white pine in the eastern United
States.
   The logging company that owns the land is ready to harvest the
trees, yet, for varied reasons, neither the U.S. Forest Service nor
the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has tried to save the
stand. The federal government is concentrating on filling in gaps in
existing national forests while the state never has formally
considered saving the pines, officials with both agencies say.
   Instead, the battle for the Estivant pines, named for the French
merchant who bought much of the local land in 1857, has fallen into
private hands, paid for by anonymous donors, blue-collar
philanthropists and grade-school students.
   It is, conservationists say, typical of new preservation efforts
throughout the nation.
   ``If the job is going to get done, we're going to have to roll up
our own sleeves and do it as private citizens,'' says Russell Van
Herik, vice president for the national Nature Conservancy's Midwest
region in Minneapolis.
   The Nature Conservancy is one of a growing number of private land
trusts that are buying up land and protecting endangered species as
quickly as donations to cover the purchases come in.
   A survey by the national Land Trust Exchange, a coordinating body
in Alexandria, Va., turned up 743 non-profit land trusts across the
United States last year, up from 535 just three years before. Half
of them have no staffs and less than $10,000 a year to spend.
Together their memberships amount to 640,000 people.
   They range from the newly formed Kachemak Bay Heritage Land Trust
in wilderness-rich Homer, Alaska, to the 98-year-old Trustees of
Reservations in crowded Massachusetts.
   ``It's an amazingly rapidly growing movement,'' says Jean Hocker,
executive director of the exchange.
   ``What's happened is a sense of real dismay of what's happening
in communities. A feeling that the people who live there have to
take care of it,'' Hocker says. ``As development pressures increase
on the land, people are realizing that protection of open land is
the responsibility of all of us.''
   While private trusts also guard land for scenic views and
playgrounds, the strongest interest is in preserving ecologically
important areas, Hocker says. Some trusts manage the sanctuaries on
their own, while others turn them over to government agencies for
public parks and forests.
   Van Herik says the Nature Conservancy considers itself ``the
Noah's ark of this country.'' The national trust, which centers its
efforts on endangered species and ecologies, has set aside 3.5
million acres of land, including 396 preserves in 12 Midwestern
states.

   Despite their growth, private land trusts won't replace
government land programs, a U.S. Forest Service official says. ``To
us, they are complimentary,'' says Harold Bolt, acting regional land
director for the Forest Service in Milwaukee, Wis.
   The Forest Service has budgeted $2 million this year to buy land
within national forests in Ohio and Illinois. It plans to spend more
than $20 million for the entire Northeast.
   But when it comes to land outside the national forests, it takes
an average of 10 years to identify, study, propose, debate and
designate land for federal acquisition, says Jane Elder, head of the
Sierra Club's Midwest offices in Madison, Wis.
   ``Land trusts can move more quickly, less expensively, and
sometimes people will consider selling to private individuals when
they won't even talk to the federal government,'' Hocker says.
   And, Elder adds, there is the worry that public designation as a
wilderness area is a kiss of death to the virginity of land
surrounded by population centers.
   ``There's a lot of fear in the Midwest that once land is
designated, it will get loved to death,'' by backpackers, trail
bikes and others using it, she says.
   Land trusts have cropped up in Arizona, Wyoming and New Mexico,
but they remain concentrated in the East and Midwest, where there is
much development and little in the way of federal wilderness areas.
   Ohio has only 77 acres of federally protected wilderness, Elder
says. Iowa has none.
   In these areas, private trusts are finding their land in small
packages, nestled among cornfields and smokestacks.
   ``It doesn't look like Yellowstone and it doesn't look like
Yosemite,'' Elder says. ``But you can find quiet and solitude and
virgin white pine. And you can even get lost.''
   It takes a sophisticated citizenry to donate money for the
seemingly unspectacular: Michigan's buggy swamps, Illinois' hilltop
prairies and Iowa's freakish cool air slopes, where snails from the
Ice Age dwell.
   ``Ten years ago, the idea of an important natural area was
something that made you say `Oh!' It had to be 1,000 feet high and
there had to be waterfalls,'' Van Herik says.
   Rooks didn't gamble on such sophistication in 1971 when the
Estivant pines first were timbered. He told corporate landowners
their loggers were felling the oldest trees in the Midwest.
   ``They could have been. Nobody knew,'' Rooks admits now.
   Either way, the logging stopped long enough for the Michigan
Nature Association to buy 200 acres for $42,145. The next 80 acres
cost $100,000 this May and the association is now negotiating for
another 97 acres.
   Later, Rooks discovered among the pines the Leaning Giant, a
tilted monolith of a white pine that won Michigan Botanical Society
and national honors as the second-largest white pine in the East
before teetering to the ground in October 1987.
   The Michigan Nature Association since has learned the hard way
that its remote island of trees is as vulnerable as the timber
forest surrounding it. A logger wandered into the Estivant pines two
years ago, felling giant after giant, before he realized he was in
the wrong place.
   Now, the Lake Superior Land Co. says it will return to timber the
rest of the virgin forest. It's either buy or cut, says Gary Willis,
a commercial forester and a volunteer for the Michigan Nature
Association.
   ``Economically speaking, the stand should be cut,'' Willis says.
But, ``Simply put, we'll never see it again, in our lifetimes,
anywhere.''
   Preservation vs. development isn't the issue, says Lake Superior
Land Co. President Bob Grasseschi.
   ``It's simply economics. The stand is mature. It's a natural
resource like any that should be used in a responsible way,''
Grasseschi says. ``It's just a question of paying for that
resource.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Most of the canals have been filled in now and
Venice, Calif., is hardly the cultural center it was envisioned to
be back at the turn of the century. In fact, some would say this
seaside suburb of Los Angeles, which enjoyed a brief boom as an oil
town, is downright seedy. But if you're looking for colorful
characters from the counterculture, you need look no farther.

   California-bound tourists tired of Disneyland
and Hollywood have an offbeat alternative in Venice, the funky beach
town where everyday sights include a minstrel on roller skates and
wilting flower children reading tarot cards.
   Patterned after its Italian namesake and featuring a few
surviving canals, the one-time center of Prohibition-era speak-easy
night life was adopted by Beat Generation poets before hippies made
it their Southern California crash pad.
   It is the home to fabled Muscle Beach and remains a
counterculture haven for 1960s-style peace protesters, New Age
healers, artists, roller skaters, surfers and scores of street
performers. Acts range from a chain-saw tossing juggler to a limbo
dancer prancing on a bed of broken glass.
   ``This is America we come to see,'' says Ingrid Nilsson, 22, of
Sweden. ``We can wear bikinis and go shopping.''
   Competing for tourist dollars along bustling Ocean Front Walk are
peddlers offering rock crystals touted for their alleged healing
powers, tie-dyed clothing and handmade jewelry sold on card tables.
Storefront merchants sell souvenir T-shirts, sunglasses and hats.
   Sprinkled among the vendors are aging hippie fortunetellers,
peace activists selling bumper stickers and buttons, caricature
artists and masseuses, including one who offers a standing massage
within a wood-pole pyramid topped with aluminum foil.
   Vivid, sometimes startling wall murals appear anonymously
overnight, only to be plastered with colorful gang graffiti within
days.
   Out-of-town visitors mingle at sidewalk cafes with
espresso-sipping Bohemians sporting ponytails and wearing tattered
jeans. Strollers meander through clouds of incense, chanting
Buddhists, naked toddlers and pungent smoke wafting from marijuana
joints puffed in the open.
   Cops walking their beats in short pants occasionally draw near
undetected and move in to make a collar.
   Hungry visitors choose between take-out meals ranging from
vegetarian fast-food to New York-style pizza as they watch daredevil
roller skaters jump hurdles or an elderly thrill-seeker known as
Skateboard Mama weave through a slalom course marked by empty cups.
   Venice's eclectic allure has drawn such celebrity residents as
Charlie Chaplin, the late rock 'n' roll star Jim Morrison,
science-fiction author Ray Bradbury, actor-director Dennis Hopper
and actress Lisa Bonet of ``The Cosby Show.''
   Sometimes called Los Angeles' ``Slum by the Sea,'' Venice is
sandwiched between upscale, rent-controlled Santa Monica to the
north and the yachting yuppie enclave of Marina del Rey to the south.
   Venice's liberal reputation draws hundreds of homeless people and
teen-age runaways to its alleyways, in addition to muscle-bound
bodybuilders, skinhead punk rockers, nude sunbathers and hordes of
tourists.
   It also has its share of run-down neighborhoods populated by
violent street gangs, drug dealers, prostitutes and
``strawberries,'' the slang name given to streetwalkers who sell
themselves in exchange for drugs.
   ``People who don't fit in anywhere else find a home here, even if
it's only for a week or a night _ or an hour,'' says Oscar, a
bedraggled blues singer who declined to give his last name.
   ``Got me a little angel. I love the way she spreads her wings,''
Oscar croons, a grimy cap set on the ground to receive donations
from appreciative passersby.
   Another Venice street minstrel, who has become something of a
rolling landmark, is Harry Parry, a costumed guitar player who
skates among the tourists every day, pausing to serenade anyone
willing to listen.
   ``This beach is an oasis of light in a pool of darkness _ where
we can all be who we are,'' says Parry, who covers his massive
dreadlock hairdo in a makeshift turban and wears baseball shin
guards over his flowing robes as part of his distinctive outfit.
   His skates are remnants of the 1970s, when Venice became the
Southern California center for disco roller-skating. Skaters still
flock to Venice, including one known as Tex who rolls on
18-inch-tall stilt skates mounted to his cowboy boots.
   Venice was created soon after the turn of the century on 160
acres about 15 miles west of downtown Los Angeles by tobacco
millionaire Abbot Kinney, who envisioned a stately cultural center
serviced by an array of canals.
   He imported singing gondoliers from Italy to operate a flotilla
of authentic Venetian gondolas and officially opened the new
community on July 4, 1905. Attractions included a carnival pier and
a miniature railroad.
   Kinney's highbrow dreams of a fine arts center fizzled. Developed
instead were bawdy vaudeville acts, gin joints, gambling dens and
freak shows.
   Its main daytime attraction was a covered bathhouse that featured
heated sea water and 600 private dressing rooms for modest bathers.
   Actress Sarah Bernhardt performed at the 3,400-seat Venice
Auditorium in 1906 and reportedly made 20 curtain calls during three
sold-out shows, but few other celebrities of note came to Venice
other than to gamble or sample the racy night life.
   Perhaps the first person to ride the surf at Venice was Olympic
swimmer Duke Kahanamoku, a Hawaiian native considered to be the
father of modern wave riding. Historians report he rode a redwood
surfboard near the popular pier in the first decade of the 20th
century.
   Most of the original canals were filled in during the 1930s and
not long afterward Venice became an oil boom town dotted with
derricks which were dismantled later when the crude dried up.
   Venice is to beach towns what Berkeley is to college towns, and
fueling its diverse, avant-garde image are chic art galleries,
trendy coffeehouses and pricey restaurants.
   Further contrasts are provided by fortress-like remodeled homes
surrounded by fences topped with razor-sharp barbed wire that stand
alongside dilapidated seaside cottages, some occupied by several
families.
   Prominent in the gentrification of Venice is 72 Market Street, a
dinner house opened by Tony Bill, producer of such films as
``Shampoo'' and ``The Sting,'' with the help of investors such as
actor Dudley Moore, who occasionally drops in to play the piano.
   Topping a long list of serious art sellers in Venice is the L.A.
Louver Gallery, which introduced internationally renowned painter
David Hockney to Southern California.
   A popular gathering spot to see and be seen over espresso and
croissants is the Rose Cafe, where aspiring actors read scripts
before auditions, writers scribble in notebooks and occasionally a
working actor like Gary Busey stops in for a bite.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When he won the Van Cliburn competition in Fort
Worth, Texas, in 1973, it seemed that the world of Vladimir Viardo
had changed forever. But it led to a musical odyssey that found him
back in the Soviet Union, locked away from Western audiences. Now he
seems to have found a happy ending.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One night in a Ukrainian village, Vladimir Viardo
was playing a Chopin barcarole when he noticed cockroaches crawling
out of the keyboard. Even more disconcerting was the horse and cart
that failed to negotiate a U-turn on the road outside the hall and
crashed through a window and onto the stage.
   That was during the 13 years when Viardo was forbidden to leave
the Eastern bloc, before he became the first Soviet artist to be
allowed to move to the West with his family while retaining his
citizenship.
   This spring, Viardo played a very different venue. At Carnegie
Hall, he punctuated his concert by pounding his fist on the keyboard
of a Steinway grand piano, sweeping it across the keys to a bass
note and an electrifying ovation.
   ``For years I collected rage _ and I could hit,'' he says. ``Once
you've tasted freedom, you don't want to be subdued anymore.''
   In December, he moved into a New York apartment with his wife and
two sons _ with the approval of the Soviet government. Unlike many
of his colleagues, he did not defect and continues to perform in his
native land.
   ``I didn't want to leave forever, Russian nostalgia is a very
strong feeling,'' says the 39-year-old pianist in fluent,
Slavic-accented English.
   But the pull of the New World _ particularly Texas _ is equally
strong.
   ``I have such a special feeling for Texas, such tenderness,'' he
says. ``It is a sort of native land for me, I spiritually recognize
it.''
   It was there, in Fort Worth, that Viardo's U.S. career began in
1973, when his musical panache and vast technical arsenal carried
him to victory in the Van Cliborn Competition. A two-year tour of
the West ensued, but on the eve of a 1976 U.S. trip, Soviet
officials canceled all his foreign engagements _ one by one over
three weeks, without an explanation.
   For years, Viardo's performances were confined to the Soviet
Union and a few East bloc countries. Most of his 80 yearly concerts
were played in the biggest halls on the best pianos, and he was
well-known to Soviet audiences. But he also brought music to the
farmers, sometimes having to fix broken hammers in pianos before he
could perform.
   ``The inner world was the only escape for me in the Soviet
Union,'' says Viardo. ``I lost friends because I did not participate
in the political system. I was broken spiritually, but my music was
really better after that, because I used this pressure for artistic
purposes.''
   In Moscow, he says, ``when I felt very lonely, I played a cycle
of `loneliness' _ the Schubert songs transcribed by Liszt. It was
public loneliness, on the stage.''
   Then came the 1980s and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness. Viardo was allowed to travel
abroad twice _ to play in Western Europe in the summer of 1987, and
again in the summer of 1988, when he replaced an ailing Soviet
emigre pianist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood
Bowl.
   The big break came in the fall of 1988, when he was on a tour of
Europe, South Africa, Argentina and the United States. He was
offered an artist-in-residence position at the University of North
Texas, in Denton.
   His old friends from Texas had never forgotten him, visiting
Moscow repeatedly, working to bring him back. And as he traveled on
a highway between Dallas and Fort Worth, a ``child's feeling''
induced him to stay.
   ``The political structure in Russia was changing and I thought,
`This is the right moment,''' Viardo recalls. ``I did not bring my
music, my books, or even much underwear. But I said, `Why not?'''
   He wrote a letter to the Soviet ambassador in Washington asking
that his wife Natasha be allowed to bring their children to the
United States. Four nervous weeks later, the Soviets granted what he
calls ``oral permission'' for his sons to leave the Soviet Union.
   Natasha Viardo and sons Philipp, 12, and Alexander, 5, left
Moscow for New York on Dec. 11. Gorbachev was to be in New York that
day, and Viardo calculated that the Soviets would not block his
family's exit because they would not want to cause their leader any
embarrassment.

   The exit came off without a hitch, though Viardo notes that the
Soviets have never provided a written guarantee that his family can
continue to stay outside the Soviet Union and keep their citizenship.
   The U.S. government also did not give the Viardos free rein.
After Viardo met with President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State
George Shultz, the U.S. government gave him a visa so he could teach
at the University of North Texas twice a month until 1990.
   But Viardo cannot travel beyond a 25-mile radius of any American
city and he must make a special request for every tour within the
United States. And he must re-apply for his work permit each time he
returns from abroad.
   Still, he feels ``much more free with self-expression in the West
_ I felt myself getting rotten playing all the time with the same
Soviet orchestras.''
   The pianist says he wants his music-making to be ``bigger and
higher up'' than the mechanics of the instrument.
   ``I am not interested only in piano playing...I have to be in
love with pieces...I am in love now with the Second Shostakovich
Sonata, madly in love. I feel that the open, painful touches suit
me.''
   In April, Viardo seduced the Carnegie Hall audience with a
program of sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, Rachmaninoff's ``Corelli
Variations'' and Debussy's impressionistic Preludes.
   To end the program, the pianist offered the American premiere of
some theater music by the 20th-century Soviet composer Dimitri
Shostakovich. Viardo played ``The Bedbug'' like a Broadway showman,
his fingers prancing on the keys with what he calls ``deadly humor''
and a wry smile. But he says the general feeling of the program was
of ``slowly sliding from the roof and struggling to keep yourself
up, not knowing if you'll fall off.''
   ``The Rachmaninoff and the Scarlatti are united by a concealed
pain,'' he says _ the 19th-century Russian composer's piece alludes
to his impending death and the 18th-century Italian composer
reflects on his unrequited love for a student.
   Rachmaninoff ``is for me nostalgic. He went abroad after the 1917
Bolshevik revolution and suffered because he was not able to be in
Russia.''
   Next season, Viardo is scheduled to return to the Soviet Union
for concerts, followed by an American tour with the Moscow
Philharmonic. But these dates were arranged before he brought his
sons to the United States; since then, there have been no new offers
of concerts in the Soviet Union.
   Viardo was born in the village of Krasnaya Polyana. He received
his first piano lessons at age 6 from his grandmother, a former
Stalinist camp inmate who took care of him while his mother, a
pianist and singer, was touring.
   ``My mama told me, `I'll throw you into the water like a puppy'''
when she sent him to music school in Moscow at the age of 14. At
first, he says, he had little money. He slept in railroad cars in a
depot each night.
   ``It didn't upset me, not at all, because lots of spiritual
things were going on. The greatest experience was to go to the
conservatory,'' he says.
   He received a doctorate from the conservatory in 1975, and taught
there until last year. In May, he performed at the school as part of
a tour that included stops in France, Belgium and Israel.
   His success notwithstanding, the move to the United States has
not been an easy one. ``I had a very heavy period in New York, it
was very hard with the psychological changes...I've become a
different animal here.'' He feels he ``must accelerate events, make
up for lost time.''
   Although he has received rave reviews from American critics for
his poised lyricism, lucid tone and flashy pyrotechnics, Viardo
admits he needs more concerts to build a fast-track Western career.
   And Viardo says he sometimes misses his Moscow life and friends,
his dacha, his five pianos and his native Caucasian mountains.
   Ask him if he is happy, and he will demur.
   ``Happiness in the Russian interpretation is something you will
never reach,'' he says. Still, he is happy to have a piano and a
studio, happy to have a contented family, happy to travel and to
meet people.
   Most of all, ``I am always happy when I hear my colleagues
playing well and playing from the heart and touching the sky. I
start to physically perspire, to jump, it makes me really out of my
mind.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Formed in upstate New York soon after the Civil
War, the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry became an
agrarian movement that helped improve life in rural America through
cooperative enterprise. The Grange hall also was the center of
social activity in many a small town. Now the Grange appears to be
dying on the vine, its membership dwindling and aging.

<TEXT>
   Here in the birthplace of the Grange, a
recent regional meeting of the farmers' organization grew boisterous
when about 60 members showed up. It reminded Charles David Fryer of
the good old days.
   ``That's the way it used to be when I joined,'' says Fryer,
Grange No. 1's master or chief presiding officer,
   That was in the early 1950s, a time when the local Grange hall
was the social center of many rural communities in America and the
organization had 880,000 members nationally. The Grange, in those
days, was a prime force in the movement to modernize life outside
the cities.
   Now, the National Grange for the Patrons of Husbandry, which was
formed in this picturesque town in western New York shortly after
the Civil War, appears to be dying on the vine, its membership
dwindling and aging.
   A typical bimonthly meeting of the Fredonia chapter draws only
about 10 to 20 members.
   ``We're down to 101 members,'' says Fryer, noting that 15 years
ago there were more than 300. ``We've lost a lot of members through
death and we've had a lot of members drop out because they've just
lost interest.''
   The Grange _ one of the first fraternal organizations to stress
family membership and the participation of women as equals with men
_ is now down to about 335,000 members nationally.
   ``Our losses go along with other fraternal organizations,'' says
the Grange's national president, Robert Barrow. ``People are just
not getting involved. There are too many things going on in the
community.''
   A lack of community activities in small towns helped fuel the
Grange's growth after Oliver Hudson Kelley and six others organized
the first Grange in 1868. By 1872, there were more than 1,000
chapters.
   The Grange was organized to help unite farmers from the North and
South following the Civil War and provide a family oriented
fraternal organization to improve the economic and social position
of the farm population.
   The Granges became political forums, seeking to correct economic
abuses through cooperative enterprise. The organization pushed a
legislative agenda that would chalk up some impressive successes:
rural electrification, free rural mail delivery, the federal highway
system. The ``Granger Laws'' regulating railroads and grain storage
facilities established the constitutional principle of public
regulation of private utilities.
   But the Grange hall also provided a variety of social activities
_ dances, dinners, contests, shows, sales and games _ that made the
meetings the place to be to have fun in many small communities.
   Grange member Grace Reifler recalls: ``Years ago, you didn't have
television. To go out a couple of nights a month was a big event. It
was a social affair.''
   ``Our Grange was filled. They were all filled,'' said Claire, a
63-year member who asked that her last name not be used. ``We had
young people, parents, kids up to the age where they were old enough
to join. We used to have a good time.''
   Change came after World War II. Radio, and then television,
provided in-house entertainment. Young people began to desert the
small towns for the big cities and the farm population began to
decline.
   A big blow to the Grange came in the 1950s, when it was no longer
necessary to join in order to purchase low-cost insurance. Members
who had joined specifically for the insurance left and Grange
membership began to fall.
   In New York, a large share of the 25,000 members are senior
citizens.
   ``I would say more than half are over age 60,'' Morse says.
``We're not taking in the age group we need now.''
   This helps create an image problem that Granger Blanche Rice runs
into when she talks with her grandchildren about joining.
   ``You know what their answer is?'' she says. ``Why would we want
to hang around a bunch of old people?''
   Linda Kesby, 39, says most of the 16 members in her Grange in
Ellery, N.Y. ``are a great deal older and they're having to decide
what they want to do about the Grange.''
   If they do join, younger members often find many older members
resistant to change and new ideas, according to Joe Trask, master of
the Grange in Hamburg, N.Y.
   ``One Grange got some younger people in and they got the idea
they would make some money for the treasury by holding a square
dance,'' Trask recalls. ``The older members said, `Wait a minute, we
just paid to have this floor refinished. You're not going to scratch
that floor with a square dance. Tunnel vision.''
   Neva Woolley, deputy state master, adds, ``I think it's a real
problem. You constantly hear, `Well, we don't do it this way, we've
always done it this way.' I think change is essential. We're in a
changing world and you have to keep up with the times.''
   One change that Barrow said had a ``50-50 chance'' of being
implemented is a modification in the Grange's rituals, which date
back to its formation and which some younger members don't see as
necessary. ``Some of it has to be brought up to modern-day
language,'' he says.
   Most members aren't against some ritual change, but it's not
likely the Grange will remove its prohibition against alcohol.
   ``I don't think the members will ever change that,'' Barrow says.
   Grange leaders have organized a youth leadership program which
has met with some success.
   ``We went to a youth conference in February and there were over
100 young Grangers there under the age of 25,'' Kesby says. ``And
they were very enthusiastic, wanting to get the Grange going more in
their area.''
   The Grange's long-standing policy of letting other community
organizations and groups use its local halls for their activities
may also help draw in non-members such as Gerri Centenella.
   She has been conducting fitness classes out of the Fredonia hall
and was attending the regional meeting with her husband.
   ``They told me to just come and see what it was like,'' she says.
After the meeting, she said she was considering joining.
   The odds seem long, however, that the Grange will recover its old
glory. As one local leader put it, unless changes are made to bring
in younger members, ``by the year 2010, we'll be extinct.''

   The role that beautiful, outgoing Polly Draper
landed in ABC's ``thirtysomething'' originally called for an
overweight, mousy frump.
   ``The producers liked me and flew me out from New York for some
tests as Ellyn,'' she says. ``They said they loved me but they
didn't think I was right for the role.''
   The tall, svelte Draper could never be called a frump. And with a
strong, sometimes almost overwhelming personality, she's hardly
mousy.
   ``In the beginning, they saw Ellyn as sort of on the pathetic
side,'' she says. ``My personality is just too strong.
   ``They changed the concept of the character because they realized
there was more opportunity for growth. Then they began writing for
me. They knew I loved to do comedy, so they wrote some humor in.''
   ``Thirtysomething,'' the so-called ``yuppie soap opera,'' has
just completed its second year on ABC. The drama, created by
Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, has a strong following among
young adults. But overall, it's not strong in the ratings and wasn't
in the Top 30 shows for the season.
   The series follows a group of young people coping with careers,
marriage, children and contemporary life. The characters seem to
spend as much time moping as coping and the ``whine'' list on this
show is strictly vintage.
   The series also stars Timothy Busfield, Peter Horton, Melanie
Mayron, Ken Olin, Patricia Wettig and Mel Harris.
   Draper was interviewed during a break in the filming. Although
most shows are out of production at this time, the producers
scheduled three shows for next season in anticipation of an actors'
strike, which never came to pass.
   ``Melanie Mayron and I play the single girls and the show we're
doing is about computer dating,'' she says. ``We just can't meet the
kind of men we want to meet, which is flawless men. I've just broken
up with my boyfriend in the show. Ellyn also has an ulcer from her
high-powered job as the head of some kind of program at City Hall
and from the strain of everything else.''
   Draper was living in New York, doing mostly theater, when she
auditioned for ``Thirtysomething.''
   ``I'd never auditioned for a series before because if you did a
series that meant you couldn't do movies,'' she says. ``I made a
living acting. I did some small parts in films. I was almost getting
good parts in movies and getting disappointed. Almost getting a role
is the worst thing. It's like being runner-up in the Miss America
Pageant.
   ``I played Marilyn Monroe in a play in New York called
`Insignificance,' believe it or not. It took me two hours to get
into makeup and costume. I was shocked when I saw myself in the
mirror.''
   Draper was born in Gary, Ind., but grew up in Palo Alto, Calif.
   ``I went to Yale so I really feel like I'm from the East,'' she
says.
   Her father is an official with the United Nations and her
grandfather was Gen. William H. Draper Jr., one of the architects of
the Marshall Plan.
   ``The only thing I can remember about Gary is that I was bitten
by a hamster when I was 3,'' she says.
   ``I sort of got into acting because in the eighth grade there was
a boy I wanted to kiss. I'd never really been kissed. So I created
this whole Camelot play so he could play Lancelot and I was
Guinevere. But it didn't work out. Our noses kept getting in the
way. I didn't really know how to kiss. On the way home I kept hoping
the school bus would crash.''
   Draper says that since then she's learned how to kiss and how to
act.
   ``I'm also single this year,'' she says. ``It's frightening. I
separated from my husband. We're taking a vacation together,
however.''
   Her husband is Kevin Wade, who wrote the screenplay for ``Working
Girl.''
   She and Melanie Mayron also did a layout for Vogue magazine.
   ``It took five hours just for the makeup and lighting,'' she
says. ``Both of us came away with a lot of beauty tips.''

   More than four months after taking a detour from
dance to star on Broadway in a stage version of Kafka's
``Metamorphosis,'' Mikhail Baryshnikov still calls his first theater
experience ``scary.''
   ``It means going out there every night and speaking those first
few words of dialogue,'' says the man who has thrilled the world of
Western ballet ever since he defected from the Soviet Union in
1974.``Sometimes you have to push the sounds out of your throat.''
   Baryshnikov has been fighting that fear eight times a week in
``Metamorphosis,'' Steven Berkoff's adaptation of Franz Kafka's
short novel about a young man named Gregor Samsa who awakens one
morning to find he has turned into an insect.
   ``There is something about theater in general,'' he says quietly.
``You have to go out there and tell a story with words. When people
come to the ballet, they expect you will dance.''
   Baryshnikov sat in his dressing room in the Metropolitan Opera
House where American Ballet Theater, which he runs, is rehearsing
its summer season. He was in the middle of a five-week break from
``Metamorphosis'' to keep the ballet company up to performance level
and star for one benefit performance in Martha Graham's ballet
``Night Journey.''
   Now he has returned to the play which has reopened at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater for a limited run through July 15.
   ``I didn't know what to expect because it was my first theater
experience,'' says Baryshnikov, who has already tried the movies
with such films as ``The Turning Point'' and ``White Nights.'' ``I
just pretty much went with Steven's directions. In a certain sense,
I tried to imitate him because he is a great mime. When he
rehearses, he does all the parts, not only Gregor. During the
rehearsal, I was pretty much amazed by his metamorphosis.''
   Baryshnikov first saw the play last year in Paris when Roman
Polanski played the bug in a production also directed by Berkoff.
The dancer calls Polanski ``the godfather'' of ``Metamorphosis'' on
Broadway.
   ``I was very moved by his performance,'' Baryshnikov recalls.
``He was quite wonderful. We ended up just talking about theater in
general. He said, `If you are that interested in theater, why don't
you try it? I think you will have a lot of fun with this role as I
do.'''
   Several weeks later, producer Lars Schmidt, who bankrolled the
Paris production, called Baryshnikov and suggested he consider
appearing in the show on Broadway.
   The play was first done at Duke University in North Carolina in
February, to give the dancer a chance to get used to his new role as
actor not dancer, and moved to New York the following month.
   His portrait of Gregor came from many sources, he says.
   ``I remembered certain things about Polanski's performance,''
Baryshnikov says. ``And there was also my humble ideas about this,
too. Those combinations worked together.''
   The dance superstar also learned a great deal by watching other
actors _ particularly Rene Auberjonois, Laura Esterman and Madeleine
Potter who play his father, mother and sister in the show.
   ``I saw what kind of choices they made in the day-to-day
rehearsals and from performance to performance,'' Baryshnikov says.
``There are endless possibilities of interpretation, but I wasn't
sure how free I could be in this material.''
   Berkoff, an English playwright and actor, wrote ``Metamorphosis''
in the late 1960s and since then has directed nearly a dozen
productions of it around the world. The Broadway set resembles a
giant spider, an iron jungle gym from which Baryshnikov hangs or
scurries about on all fours.
   ``The movement was a collaboration between myself and Steven, but
a lot of it was pretty much set, particularly the main positions and
what to do with my arms,'' Baryshnikov says. ``But Steven said that
everyone adds a slightly different quality to the choreography of
it.''
   The performer knew a lot of Kafka's works, particularly ``The
Trial'' and his diaries.
   ``A lot of Gregor is in Kafka's life,'' he says. ``The role is
very much Kafka's thoughts about his relationship with his family
and the way he felt about them.''
   The vocal aspect of the role was the most difficult for him. To
prepare, Baryshnikov began taking voice lessons last fall with a
voice teacher at the Juilliard School.
   ``I first learned English from the streets and from television,''
he says. ``I imitated it phonetically. When I speak Russian I speak
with a much deeper voice because it is more natural for me. The
teacher from Juilliard taught me how to breathe on stage and not
choke myself.''
   But is there a bit of Baryshnikov in Gregor, too?
   ``In any role, whether you are a dancer or a singer or an actor,
there is a part of you, a part of your experience as a human being,
a part of your past, the way you have been brought up,'' he says.
``Your life experience reflects through any role.''
   ``Metamorphosis'' has opened the door to new stage and film
offers, but he hasn't committed himself to any just yet.
   ``I might try to wear too many hats,'' he says. ``There are a few
roads I can take.
   ``I would like to rest, think, read, travel and spend more time
with my daughter,'' says Baryshnikov referring to his 8-year-old
daughter, Shura, who lives with her mother, actress Jessica Lange.
``In the last few years, I've had to make a lot of decisions without
the full understanding of what I'm getting into. There was no time
for thinking.''
   His days still begin with early morning dance classes, whether he
is appearing in ``Metamorphosis'' or not.
   How will he know when to stop dancing?
   ``I will know pretty much and it will be my decision, but I have
some good friends who will say to me, `Get off the stage.'''
   ``I am slowing down,'' adds the 41-year-old star. ``If I'm
dancing, I want to learn something new like Martha Graham's ``Night
Journey.'' I am not interested anymore just to dance for dance's
sake, particularly roles which I have been doing for many years.
When life is passing by, you really have to do something new all the
time.''

   One of the three nations seized by communist
forces in the Indochina War, Cambodia plummeted into even greater
turmoil and death in what was supposed to an era of reconstruction.
An AP correspondent who has kept watch on Cambodia from Thailand in
all those years finds things are beginning to change now for
Cambodians.

   ``No more revolution,'' a communist
government official shouted over the din of live American rock
music. ``And no more curfew. We can dance until morning.''
   Such euphoria is strikingly new in Cambodia, and so is the fact
that anyone would express it so openly to a visiting Western
journalist. Just a few months ago it would have been politically
dangerous to do so, and dancing until dawn would have been
impossible because of a decade-long curfew that had closed down the
Cambodian capital at night.
   But 1989 brought a series of major reforms, along with efforts to
end a civil war with anti-government guerrillas, that have changed
the rules and the mood in Cambodia, which has been under the rule of
various communist factions since the end of the Indochina War in
1975.
   A hunger for consumer goods, a mini construction boom and dancing
fever at Phnom Penh's growing number of nightclubs appear to be
symptoms of hope that Cambodia's long agony is nearly over.
   The freer speech seems to reflect a shift to liberalism among the
motley mix of revolutionaries and technocrats who have run the
country since the Vietnamese invaded 10 years ago and ousted the
Khmer Rouge faction that had turned the country into a killing
ground where perhaps a million people were killed or died of
government-imposed hardship.
   These days Phnom Penh's central market, originally planned for
state ownership, is a haggling, colorful and prospering arena of
free enterprise. Along Ok Nha Sou St., thousands of motorbikes that
failed road inspection tests in Singapore have been shipped in,
repaired and snapped up by customers paying as much as $600 in gold.
   A marked improvement is evident in residential buildings, the
result, said Vice Mayor Roth Sarin, of a recent ordinance allowing
private ownership of property in a city which has grown from a ghost
town at the end of the Khmer Rouge era to 300,000 people in 1981 and
nearly a million today.
   Led by the 38-year-old Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Marxist
government has also given farmers ownership of their land, declared
Buddhism the state religion and abolished the death penalty. It has
promised to allow opposition political parties, something
neighboring Vietnam and most other communist countries still reject.
   ``If we (the Communist Party) lose in general elections we will
be ready to step aside. We are ready to play the democratic game,''
newspaper editor Khieu Khanharith said in an interview. ``How can
one party pretend to represent all strata of society? How can a
Leninist party represent Buddhist monks?''
   Government officials say the impetus for change comes from many
quarters.
   The Phnom Penh government hopes its liberal posture will woo back
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's leader until
he was overthrown by pro-West Cambodians in 1970. The return of
Sihanouk would likely gain Cambodia both international recognition
and badly needed foreign aid and at the same time weaken the Khmer
Rouge, with whom Sihanouk is linked in an anti-government guerrilla
alliance.
   With Vietnam promising to pull all its troops out of Cambodia by
Sept. 30, the Phnom Penh leaders will need determined support from
the population to face the still potent Khmer Rouge and their
leader, Pol Pot, who led the postwar reign of terror.
   Communism, Hun Sen has said, does not go well with most
Cambodians, but liberal reforms do.
   The communist world too, officials point out, is changing, and
war-weary Cambodia needs urgently to end its isolation and poverty
by being flexibile.
   ``If you stand up stubbornly to a strong wind you will be blown
over,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Chum Bun Rong said.
   ``The Cambodian problem is 70 percent solved,'' declared another
Foreign Ministry official, echoing what some Western residents here
believe is over-optimism about the future. Many Cambodians say they
are elated that Sihanouk might return to Phnom Penh and they paint a
rosy picture of economic prosperity just around the corner.
   But the peace process depends on the potentially explosive
chemistry of several parties including the changeable Sihanouk, the
hard-line Khmer Rouge and its Chinese armorers. Regarded as the most
powerful group opposing the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government,
the Khmer Rouge has been eerily quiet on the battlefields but
Sihanouk recently predicted they would launch a major offensive this
fall.
   ``People are enthusiastic about the changes Hun Sen is bringing
but we're still dead scared of the Khmer Rouge,'' said one
businessman, reflecting the deep scars the Khmer Rouge inflicted
during its 1975-79 rule.
   Economically, too, there are major hurdles ahead.
   Among the world's poorest nations, the ``half war, half peace''
of the past decade has prevented a regeneration of the country's
shattered infrastructure. Hul Lim, a senior official of the Planning
Ministry, projected that it will take Cambodia until the year 2000
to reach the level of per capita output of goods and services it had
attained in 1970.
   In another interview, Uy Sambath of the Commerce Ministry listed
the country's 1988 exports as $30 million, with imports totaling
$125 million. The economy survives, he said, on credits from the
Soviet Union, barter trade and unofficial cross-border trade
exchanges with Thailand.
   But many here are convinced the economy _ some 60 to 70 percent
of it already in private hands _ is slowly improving. A
psychological boost is provided by the growing number of Western aid
agencies setting up offices in Phnom Penh and businessmen from
Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand coming to survey investment
possibilities.
   Anticipating the arrival of foreign companies, and the higher
salaries they will offer, thousands of people are taking English
lessons in private homes in an area now being called ``The English
Quarter.''
   The loosening of restrictions also has led to more ostentatious
displays of wealth. Phnom Penh's moneyed class can now buy American
cosmetics, French champagne, Thai beer and perhaps even a small
Japanese car. Lavish wedding parties, a prime status symbol, average
200,000 riel ($1,300), a sum far out of reach of the average
Cambodian.
   Life affords few luxuries in the countryside, but Chea Kong, a
vice director in the Agriculture Ministry, said the once dangerous
deficits of rice have been brought down to this year's manageable
shortage of 50,000 tons. More construction is also evident in rural
areas where, contrary to guerrilla claims, most Western aid workers
say the government has established considerable authority.
   ``I see lethargy, negligence, lack of initiative, stupid
bureaucracy,'' said one senior international aid official. ``But at
the same time I am amazed at what they have achieved in 10 years,
given their start from zero and their ostracism by the international
community. Nothing works well here, but it works.''

<TEXT>
   A dedicated communist who lost an eye
fighting for the Khmer Rouge in the Indochina War, Prime Minister
Hun Sen has emerged as a key figure in resolving Cambodia's civil
war.
   Once dismissed by the West as a puppet of the Vietnamese, Hun Sen
is preparing to run a country that Vietnam promises will be free of
all its troops by Sept. 30.
   In the meantime he has stepped up negotiations with Cambodian
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and others to end a
guerrilla war that is sapping the country's limited resources and
energy.
   One of world's youngest government heads, the 38-year-old Hun Sen
has impressed diplomats and Western aid officials in Phnom Penh.
   ``He began as a country boy. Now, he's by far the most
intelligent of the lot,'' said a senior Soviet diplomat in Phnom
Penh.
   When this correspondent first interviewed Hun Sen in 1980, his
responses were straight down the Marxist line, and he appeared to
have a poor grasp of issues.
   The Hun Sen of today is said to have picked up an impressive
range of knowledge through late-night study, foreign trips and daily
staff briefings. Aides say he is progressing well in the English,
French and Vietnamese languages.
   He has also picked up on politicking, driving his own car to
villages, listening to farmers' grievances and berating ineffective
officials on frequent inspection tours. He takes time out to play
soccer and volleyball on civil service teams.
   Hun Sen may well be preparing for an election or at least a
popularity contest with Sihanouk, who said in May he might return to
Phnom Penh.
   The prime minister appears to realize that he himself is
handicapped.
   Despite his association with the hated Khmer Rouge, Sihanouk
still commands widespread affection. Especially among older
Cambodians, he remains a father figure who presided over an era of
peace before his ouster by pro-West Cambodians in 1970 and the
apocalyptic events that precipitated.
   Hun Sen, on the other hand, fought with the Khmer Rouge in the
war against U.S.-backed Cambodians and remains a communist in a land
where the ideology was implemented with extreme brutality.
   He has said, however, that communist ideology doesn't sit well
with most Cambodians.
   Thus, Hun Sen has been the key proponent of economic and
political liberalization and Western aid officials say he gets
things done in a government rife with inefficiency and corruption.
He has maintained a clean image and appears to live modestly.
   Hun Sen's formal education stopped after high school when he
joined communist rebels fighting the Phnom Penh government. Some
Western historians say he fled in 1967 but recently he reportedly
told Sihanouk that he joined the guerrillas in 1970 because the
prince himself had sided with the Khmer Rouge and had called for a
war against the U.S.-backed government in Phnom Penh.
   The official biography says Hun Sen was born in the northeastern
province of Kompong Cham. He rose rapidly in Khmer Rouge ranks to
command a division and during an was wounded five times, losing an
eye to an artillery shell April 16, 1975, during an attack on a
government camp in his native province.
   A day later the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh to end the war and
begin a reign of terror. How far, if at all, Hun Sen participated in
Khmer Rouge atrocities is not known.
   Phnom Penh officials play up his early opposition to the the
Khmer Rouge leadership and his defection in 1977 when he and a
number of other commanders fled to the Vietnamese.
   In January, 1979, the Vietnamese entered Phnom Penh and Hun Sen
came out of the jungles to become the youngest _ and perhaps most
inexperienced _ foreign minister in the world. In January 1985 he
was named chairman of the Council of Ministers, or prime minister,
of Cambodia.

   Here are some facts and figures on Cambodia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LAND AND PEOPLE _ About the size of Missouri, Cambodia is
bordered by Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. Its population of about 8
million people is made up largely of Cambodians _ or Khmers _ with
Vietnamese, Chinese, Moslem Chams and animist tribal groups forming
minority groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOVERNMENT _ President Heng Samrin and Prime Minister Hun Sen
both defected from the Khmer Rouge, who were the victors in the
Indochina War in 1975, and sided with Vietnam, which invaded the
country in late 1978. A number of non-communists from earlier
governments occupy important positions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Although reliable statistics are unavailable, Cambodia
is widely regarded as one of the world's poorest nations. It
subsists largely on Soviet credit and barter trade in agricultural
products. The United Nations reports a very high infant mortality
rate, widespread malnutrition and an average life expectancy of 50
years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RELIGION _ Buddhism remains a major force in everyday life
despite efforts by the Khmer Rouge to destroy it. The nominally
communist government recently declared Buddhism the state religion
and says 6,000 men have entered the monkhood.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Cambodia's golden age came between the 9th and 13th
centuries when its kings ruled much of peninsular Southeast Asia
from their magnificent capital of Angkor. Neighbors preyed on it in
later centuries and France colonized Cambodia in 1863. King Norodom
Sihanouk led the country to independence in 1953. After an interlude
of peace, Cambodia was plunged into the Indochina war in 1970 with
the U.S.-backed government fighting the Khmer Rouge. The latter won
in 1975 and instituted a reign of terror until Vietnam's invasion.
Since then Vietnamese and Cambodian government forces have been
battling a Sihanouk-led coalition of guerrillas who include the
Khmer Rouge and two non-communist groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FOREIGN RELATIONS _ The United Nations recognizes the Sihanouk
coalition as Cambodia's legitimate government, while the Soviet bloc
and India have ties with the pro-Vietnamese regime in Phnom Penh.
China and Thailand provide most of the aid to the coalition and the
United States is considering military assistance to its
non-communist components.

<DATELINE>MINAMATA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a town that surrendered its name
to a deadly disease and signaled to the world what unchecked
industrial waste can do to humans, wildlife and their surroundings.
   More than 800 of its citizens paid the price in death and
thousands more have been left painfully crippled.
   In the beginning, people were left puzzled by the scourge wrought
by a chemical company's indiscriminate dumping of mercury into
Minamata Bay.
   It was 1950 and they saw fish floating belly up, birds dropping
into the sea and cats ``dancing'' in wild death convulsions.
   Then in 1956, they themselves began to feel it _ hands and feet
going numb, tunnel vision, a loss of coordination and balance,
chronic pain, convulsions and, in many cases, death.
   Until then, Minamata had been a bustling fishing and factory town
nestled between lush green rice paddies and orange groves in far
southwestern Japan. The clear blue waters of its scenic harbor
yielded abundant seafood.
   Shinobu Sakamoto and her older sister, Mayumi, were among the
first to become victims of what much later would be called Minamata
disease.
   Mayumi died in 1956 at age 5.
   Shinobu, who was born in 1956, was poisoned while in her mother's
womb. She is one of some 60 ``second generation'' victims born with
severe defects.
   Some evenings Shinobu wanders into the Soushisha, a cooperative
set up to help poisoning victims, to visit, watch television and
sometimes to spend the night in the large straw-mat room where
visitors stay.
   She speaks and walks with difficulty but is cheerful.
   The poisoning in Minamata was caused by mercury-laden water
discharged by a factory owned by the chemical company Chisso Corp.
   The pollution devastated the town.
   Its population, which was 50,000 in 1956, has dropped to 36,000
and continues to fall while the number of poison-related deaths has
climbed to 871 by local count.
   All told, about 200,000 people in Minamata and its surrounding
villages on the southwestern island of Kyushu were affected in one
way or another by the poisoning.
   The factory that polluted Minamata's harbor once employed 5,000
people. It now hires only 700; many of its buldings stand empty in
the fenced Chisso compound _ grim monuments to a disaster.
   Minamata's victims and their supporters speak of their tragedy as
a classic case of the high cost of Japan's industrialization.
   ``People just care about money and what it buys,'' said Takanori
Goto, a Tokyo lawyer who has represented some of the victims in
court. ``They're not concerned about the victims created by
industrial prosperity. Minamata is a typical example.''
   Chisso Corp., whose acetaldehyde-processing factory began dumping
an estimated total of 27 tons of mercury into Minamata Bay in 1932,
denied responsibility for the pollution, which continued until 1968.
   Minamata and several other severe outbreaks of industrial
poisoning led the government to establish an Environment Agency in
1970, but the victims have faced lengthy court battles to gain
compensation for their suffering.
   As the victims grow older _ the average age of first generation
victims is 60 _ they continue their battles in court and also
negotiate with Chisso, which is has paid so much in compensation
that it is basically insolvent, Lawyer Goto said.
   Of the 12,296 people who have applied for official designation as
Minamata disease victims, the Health and Welfare Ministry has
granted only 2,210 the official recognition that would provide them
with compensation, welfare assistance and medical care.
   ``We believe at least 10 to 20 percent of the 200,000 people
living in the affected area have symptoms of the poisoning,'' said
Teruo Kawamoto, 57, a Minamata disease victim who has led battles
with Chisso for more than 20 years.
   ``In my case, I suffer from a bad heart, numb hands and feet. I
have liver trouble, headaches and back pain. I don't really expect
to win, but I'm determined to keep on trying to help those people.''

   Kawamoto and other victims have asked the United Nations to
recognize violations of their human rights and to enforce a new
international standard for mercury pollution of 16 parts per million
in Japan, which still adheres to the previous standard of 25 parts
per million.
   Members of the Soushisha cooperative, which has a small
laboratory to test for mercury content, say the deadly metal has
drifted farther out to sea and continues to contaminate fish
officially considered safe.
   With government assistance, the company has been ordered to pay
more than $100 million to victims in compensation, in addition to
medical costs.
   It was also ordered in 1973 to clean up Minamata Bay. Chisso has
dredged much of the harbor. It is still in the process of filling in
the harbor at a cost of over more than $290 million.
   In 1987 a court found the government guilty of failing to prevent
the poisonings by allowing fishing to continue in the vicinity and
ordered it to pay 115 victims a total $4.6 million.
   In 1988, two former senior executives of Chisso were found guilty
of criminal negligence for failing to stop the pollution between
July, 1958, and June, 1968, despite Health and Welfare Ministry
warnings. The men, both elderly, received suspended jail sentences.
   Although people started falling ill in 1956, it wasn't until 1959
that it was determined that a diet heavy in mercury-contaminated
seafood caused the poisoning.
   But fishermen, dependent on the sea for their livelihood,
continued to take fish from the bay.
   The controversy over Chisso's responsibility created a deep
social rift in Minamata between families of victims and non-victims.
   Most, but not all, of the poisoning victims were families of
farmers or fishermen.
   Many of the non-victims were families of employees of Chisso
Corp., who feared for their jobs if they protested the mercury
dumping.
   In 1972, the photographer W. Eugene Smith was beaten by Chisso
employees as he took pictures of protests by victims. He later
published an award-winning photo essay and a book on the Minamata
tragedy.
   ``Twenty years ago, people told us to `get out,' and made fun of
victims,'' said Kawamoto. He added that he received hate mail from
people who called the victims ``cockroaches'' and said they should
``just die.''
   Said lawyer Goto: ``People thought it was a contagious epidemic,
or in typical Japanese fashion they blamed the victims for having
evil hearts or said they were suffering for their ancestors'
wrongdoing.''
   Cases continue to crop up, but many remain hidden because
symptoms can be light and because many people still fear the stigma
of Minamata disease. They don't tell their doctors what's really
wrong, said Ken Takakura, one of the 22 young activists in the
cooperative.
   For many Minamata residents, the question now is how to
revitalize the economy of a town notorious for pollution and ill
health, Takakura added.
   The cooperative has helped local residents shift from fishing to
growing oranges, and it markets the fruit in Tokyo. It also runs a
resource center, a farm and a museum to educate Japanese about the
Minamata tragedy.
   Town officials are promoting Minamata's tourism potential, and
people living here say the deep rift between families of victims and
non-victims has begun to heal.
   ``So many families have suffered that it's hard to be hateful
now,'' Takakura said.

   With a $112-billion foreign debt, 1,000 percent
and economic stagnation, Brazil is unable to keep up with its needs
for public health care and people are dying _ needlessly, says one
medical official. This is one of a series of periodic reports by The
Associated Press on the economic, social and political turbulence
that has turned South America into a continent in crisis.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A critically ailing economy and a
failure to allot funds have crippled Brazil's health care system.
Public hospitals are unable to give proper care to patients they
admit and often are forced to turn away the sick and injured for
lack of staff, beds, medicines, money and equipment _ even in
emergency cases.
   Many deaths _ one official says thousands _ have been attributed
to the crisis.
   At the same time, diseases long under control elsewhere in the
world _ tuberculosis, yellow fever, polio and malaria _ have made
their way back to Brazil, according to the United Nations-affiliated
World Health Organization.
   In addition, waves of strikes by doctors, nurses and workers for
better pay further hobble a system that was never at its best to
begin with. Public health doctors earn the equivalent of only $130 a
month.
   ``We are in the midst of an unprecedented health care crisis that
is causing the needless deaths of thousands of Brazilians,'' said
Dr. Laerte Andrade Vaz de Mello, president of Rio de Janeiro state's
Regional Medical Council.
   Brazil, the world's seventh largest industrial power, has one of
the world's highest infant mortality rates and ranks third worldwide
in the number of AIDS cases.
   Parasitic diseases are rampant. Malnutrition is common.
   Public hospitals are overcrowded, understaffed, ill-equipped and
poorly stocked. Doctors, nurses and staff are on strike more than
half the working year. Public hospitals in major cities lack
ambulances to reach outlying slum districts where the poor live.
   Some examples of tragic cases, as turned up in state and city
medical investigations:
   _Doctors in Brazil's largest emergency center in Rio de Janeiro
turned away a 19-year-old motorcycle-crash victim with a skull
fracture because all of its 12 operating rooms were in use and not
enough doctors were on duty at the time anyway. Two hours later the
victim died, according to Rio de Janeiro's municipal medical council.
   _Seven overcrowded Rio hospitals refused to admit a man suffering
from a severe concussion for lack of room. Fourteen hours later, the
man slipped into a coma and died en route to an eighth hospital, the
Rio State Medical Council said.
   _In Sao Paulo, the wife of a former congressman, Benedito Cintra,
in need of an emergency Caesarean section, died because the only
anesthesiologist on duty was involved in an operation on another
floor and could not get to her in time.
   The government, tottering under a $112 billion foreign debt,
1,000 percent annual inflation and negative economic growth,
contributes just 4 percent of overall revenue to health care.
   ``It's frightening,'' Dr. Ana Maria Litke, Secretary General of
Brazil's National Medical Council, told the AP. ``But life just
isn't worth that much here.''
   Further straining the health care system is the mass of people
who have poured into city slums from the impoverished countryside.
   Meanwhile, eight government ministries squabble over authority to
grant funds for health care to states and cities. Delays, sometimes
as long as three months, often cause hospital strikes and shutdowns.
   By the time money trickles down to the city level, little is
usually left, said Antonio de Carvalho, Rio's deputy health
secretary.
   Still, Brazil spent billions of dollars in the 1970s to become a
world exporter of specialized hospital technology.
   ``Our priorities are out of whack,'' said Dr. Sergio Arouca,
president of the National Doctors Union. ``We're building hospitals
in other countries and our own doctors are being paid blue-collar
wages.''
   Public health doctors are forced to moonlight as truck drivers
and policemen. Nurses take home less than $64 a month, the minimum
wage, and many supplement their wages by selling home-made items in
street markets.
   Recently, doctors, nurses and staff workers in Rio de Janeiro
went on a five-month strike, paralyzing city hospitals.
   In one incident, health officials asked Gov. Wellington Moreira
Franco to cancel the world-famous pre-Lent Carnival in Rio de
Janeiro because not enough doctors or staff would be available to
handle the increased number of injuries that occur over the four-day
period. Only then did the government rush in $5 million in emergency
relief to staff emergency wards.
   In March, federal hospitals in Brasilia, the capital, cancelled a
third of their surgery cases because of a shortage of linens and
blankets. At the same time in Sao Paulo, the nation's largest city
and main medical center, more than 90 percent of private hospitals
shut down during a strike.
   Even Rio de Janeiro's National Cancer Institute, the nation's top
public institution, closed six of 10 operating rooms because of a
40-day delay in government funding.
   Shortages of medical supplies lead to rationing, hoarding, and in
some cases, black marketing.
   Unscrupulous private dealers often buy blood from beggars and
prostitutes and resell it at a profit without testing for AIDS or
other diseases. More than 60 percent of about 6 million transfusions
done each year involve untested blood, according to the Health
Ministry.
   Even human organs are for sale, although it is illegal.
Classified ads appear daily in newspapers for corneas, kidneys and
livers.
   Proponents of health care reform are pushing Congress for a
single Health Ministry to administer funds, regionalized health
networks, a national health care fund, re-equipping of hospitals,
and construction of clinics in remote, rural areas.
   Brazil's new constitution, approved by Congress in October,
guarantees this type of health care reform, said Jose Noronha,
health secretary of Rio de Janeiro state.
   But reform would mean cutting thousands of workers from the
government payroll, a touchy issue most politicans would rather
avoid with a presidential election set for November.
   ``We're up against a wall of civil servants who won't be happy to
lose their jobs,'' Noronha said.
   The national outcry has produced a flurry of political squabbles,
but little action. Most health officials blame the inactivity on
``savage individualism'' and moral decadence they maintain is
running deep through the country.
   ``Brazilians are solely out for themselves,'' said Dr. Valdir
Cuna Goncalves, a respected cancer specialist. ``Why expect the
government's attitude to be any different?''
   But some, like Dr. Litke of the National Health Council, remain
optimistic.
   ``Brazil has the capacity to resurrect its health care system,''
she said. ``It's a matter of when people decide they've had enough
suffering.''

   Uncontrolled settlement in Brazil's
Amazon rain forest has led to an alarming spread of a centuries-old
scourge of the tropics: malaria.
   As hundreds of thousands of prospectors, farmers and adventurers
poured into Brazil's vast northern wilderness in the past decade,
many fell victim to the mosquito-borne disease.
   Last year, the Health Ministry registered 560,000 cases of
malaria in Brazil, up from 500,000 a year before. The number is
expected to rise again this year.
   To control the outbreak, the Health Ministry plans a massive
spraying campaign with DDT, an insecticide banned in many countries.
   ``Only shock treatment can contain the spread of malaria in
Amazonia,'' Dr. Agostinho Cruz Marquez, head of the Health
Ministry's malaria division, said in an interview.
   Malaria is almost exclusively a problem of Amazonia, a 2 million
square-mile wilderness sprawled across northern and western Brazil.
Of the 560,000 cases last year, 97 percent were in the Amazon states
of Amazonas, Para, Rondonia and Acre.
   The worst affected is Rondonia, a state the size of Oregon on
Brazil's western border with Bolivia and notorious for the
destruction of its rain forest. Rondonia had 42 percent of the
country's malaria cases with 192 deaths in the first eight months of
1988.
   The gold-mining town of Ariquemes in Rondonia has become ``the
world capital of malaria,'' Cruz Marquez said.
   The military government that ruled from 1964 to 1985 urged poor
Brazilians to settle in the undeveloped Amazon, using slogans such
as ``The Brave March to the West.'' Since the drive began in the
1970s, the incidence of malaria has risen more than 500 percent.
   Malaria causes fever and chills and a gradual debilitation of the
body. It can be fatal if not treated. In Brazil, 1 to 2 percent of
those who get the disease die from it, Cruz Marquez said.
   Although quinine-based drugs can cure malaria in 24 hours, the
government cannot get the medicine to all who need it throughout the
vast and often inaccessible wilderness, he added.
   The Federation of Miners says an estimated 3,000 mining sites in
Amazonia have drawn untold thousands of prospectors, shopkeepers,
pilots and prostitutes to remote areas. Often the only access is by
helicopter or small planes, which land on dirt strips.
   To attend to this population, the government's Public Health
Campaign Department has just 300 laboratories, Cruz Marquez said,
adding that in some mining sites, a Swedish-made malaria drug called
Larian that enters the country as contraband is sold ``literally for
the price of gold.''
   Now, he said, the government plans to send 70,000 army soldiers
to the region to begin the anti-malaria campaign.
   Cruz Marquez said DDT would be used because of its low cost and
effectiveness against the marlaria-carrying anopheles mosquito.
   The insecticide will not be used indiscriminately, but only to
spray inside the huts and lean-tos used by miners and settlers, he
said.
   The five-year campaign will cost $198 million and will be paid
for in part with loans from the World Bank, Cruz Marquez said.
   ``Malaria is the only thing that scares a prospector,'' he said.
``In a way, it's a giant shield of defense for the Amazon.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Alice Walker's New Age Novel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the book jacket of her new novel, ``The Temple
of My Familiar,'' Alice Walker calls the work ``a romance of the
past 500,000 years.''
   ``I mean romance not in the modern sense, but in the archaic
sense,'' the author said in a recent interview. ``The archaic
meaning is `wisdom tale.' In a wisdom tale each character develops,
goes to a new level of understanding.''
   As for the time frame, she said, ``I was going back many, many,
many, many, many years, and 500,000 seemed to cover it.''
   ``The Temple of My Familiar'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $19.95)
does indeed go back many, many, many years. Miss Lissie, one of the
book's main characters, recounts tales of her past lives going all
the way back to the dawn of civilization.
   This book, already on best-seller lists despite largely negative
reviews, is Walker's first novel since the Pulitzer Prize-winning
``The Color Purple'' was published in 1982. There is such a
demarcation in style between the two works that ``The Temple of My
Familiar'' is bound to disappoint some fans who fell in love with
the long-suffering Celie, flamboyant Shug Avery and other ``Purple''
characters. (Miss Celie and Miss Shug make cameo appearances in
``Temple'' in remembrances by the character Fanny, who is Celie's
granddaughter.)
   Whereas ``The Color Purple'' was an epistolary novel, told
through Celie's eyes and rendered in stark realism, ``The Temple of
My Familiar'' might be called a New Age novel.
   Many of its characters _ Carlotta, a South American refugee;
Arveyda, a hugely popular rock star; Fanny, a college professor
turned masseuse; and Suwelo, a male chauvinist who gets
rehabilitated _ are more like archetypes than full-blown characters,
and they all speak the touchy-feely language of
consciousness-raising. Conversations aren't at all realistic, and
it's hard to follow who's talking since they all sound alike.
   Miss Lissie, the sweet old lady who goes time-tripping, and her
companion, Hal, are by far Walker's most successful characters
because they have been given such individual and idiosyncratic
voices.
   Many of Miss Lissie's dream memories, as she calls them, directly
contradict history as it is presented in Judeo-Greco-Roman
scholarship.
   Walker, a petite woman who speaks with a soft voice showing no
hint of uncertainty, calls the myths recounted in her book ``my
world view. It's how it is for me. People will obviously have their
own world view.''
   Some of these dream memories seem a little simplistic, others are
preachy. But one, the dream that gives the book its title, stands
out for its beauty and ethereal quality.
   In the story, Lissie is an Indian woman showing a white man her
temple. Her ``familiar,'' or pet, a creature that is part bird, part
fish and part reptile, is scurrying around while she speaks, which
she finds distracting. She tries to confine the familiar by putting
a series of bowls over it, each increasingly larger, but each time
the beautiful creature breaks out. After the third escape she
realizes she has betrayed her familiar and lost something quite
precious.
   Walker said the tale came to her in a dream.
   ``I had been trying to think with my conscious mind about why
people give over their spirituality to organized religion, when in
fact you don't really need an intermediary to be connected to the
universe; everybody has that innately,'' she said. ``I was sort of
stuck, I couldn't figure it out.
   ``I started needing to paint with two colors, turquoise and
coral. I painted my bed turquoise and my ceiling coral. Then the
colors which I had been really sort of dreaming about, wanting to
use, unlocked this dream. That is the explanation _ which is that we
become distracted by the structure, we become distracted by
organized religion's trappings. We like the church, we like the
synagogue, we like the mosque and all the rituals, but we have
become so distracted by these that the familiar, which is our
spirit, the natural untamed spirit, just gets really _ you try to
imprison it, so that while you're looking at your temple, it's gone,
because its temple is freedom.''
   ``The Temple of My Familiar'' is Walker's 12th book. Originally
from Georgia, where ``The Color Purple'' was set, the 45-year-old
novelist, poet and essayist now lives in a small town outside San
Francisco, where she spends her time writing, reading and
meditating. She mentioned pointedly that she does not watch
television, a trait she shares with her character, Miss Lissie.
   ``I think television has pretty much killed off the story-telling
rituals; the real knowledge is not getting passed on,'' Walker said.
   ``The Temple of My Familiar'' is not a conventional narrative
novel and shouldn't be judged as such. Walker is asked how she would
like readers to read her book.
   ``I just want them to relax, that would be the first thing,'' she
said. ``Take a deep breath. It would be great if they meditated.
Then I think they would really get to another level. And just assume
that this is something that's meant to be a gift from me. And enjoy
it.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Jimmy Bowen's Juke Box Is Full</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Jimmy Bowen doesn't sing well and can
barely read music.
   But in a career spanning four decades, the 51-year-old Bowen has
been a record producer for pop stars such as Frank Sinatra and Dean
Martin, and such country stars as Hank Williams Jr. and Reba
McEntire.
   In the past 12 years, he has headed four Nashville record
divisions at one time or another. Right now he heads MCA's Nashville
office and is president of the new Universal Records under the MCA
corporate umbrella.
   In the spacious den of his plantation-style home sits a brightly
colored juke box containing 100 carefully selected songs. They're
hits Bowen has been associated with in some fashion.
   ``I don't have time to play it a lot,'' says Bowen, who works an
average 90 hours a week.
   Even when not at work, he is consumed by music. The huge
television screen in his den is often playing MTV. He listens to a
radio or cassette player when he takes a bath. He listens to music
on the radio next to his bed and in his car on the way to his Music
Row office and recording studio.
   Much of his career has been in producing records: directing the
recording sessions, helping choose the songs and mixing the vocals
and instrumentation into the final product.
   In 1987 alone, Bowen was the record producer on 11 No. 1 hit
singles and three No. 1 albums. He has been the producer for
Williams for nine years covering 11 albums.
   ``I think I was born with a real good ear for music in general,''
he said in an interview. ``I like all kinds of music if it's done
well. I've worked in many different kinds of music and enjoyed it.''
   Thirty years ago, he used to play bass guitar, but today he says,
``all I can do is stay in (key of) A.'' As for his singing, Bowen
says, ``I'm about a quarter tone flat.''
   While working in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, Bowen was the
record producer for Sinatra on hits such as ``Strangers in the
Night'' and ``That's Life.''
   ``I never worked with anyone who phrased better than Frank
Sinatra,'' he recalled. ``His breathing and phrasing were
incredible. He was an incredible professional. He was always
straight to the point, and he was a good human being. I really liked
him and liked working with him.''
   With Martin, Bowen was involved in two dozen hit singles and five
albums that sold at least 1 million copies each. One of the tunes
was ``Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime,'' Martin's signature song.
   ``He was the most unique, laid-back artist I ever worked with,''
he said.
   Bowen's comments on current singers under his direction:
   _ ``Reba McEntire with all those vocal gymnastics reminds me of
Ella Fitzgerald and Dinah Washington, people who did great vocal
gymnastics and still sold the message of the song.''
   _ ``Hank Williams Jr. is the best writer-artist I've ever worked
with. Twenty years from now, he will be known as a great writer like
his father is. Right now, he's such a great artist that people
aren't aware of what a great writer he is.''
   _ ``George Strait is so much like Dean Martin it's a time warp
for me. Everything is just so easy for them. There is no stress and
results just happen naturally. George could have been a big band
singer; if that's the era we were living in, that's what he would
have done.''
   Bowen, who was raised in Dumas, Texas, broke into the music
business by playing bass guitar in a band with rock 'n' roll pioneer
Buddy Knox. He co-wrote Knox's hit record in 1957, ``Party Doll.''
   He got into production work in Los Angeles in the '60s, then
moved to Nashville in the mid-'70s and concentrated his vast musical
talents on country artists.

   ``Another Woman'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated PG)
   
   Marion (Gena Rowlands) is a successful college professor,
financially secure, well-married, cultured and elegant. She also is
miserable, though at the start of Woody Allen's ``Another Woman''
she is not aware that she is.
   She is so separated from her feelings she is awakened only by the
mournful talk of Hope (Mia Farrow) to her therapist, heard through a
heating vent in Marion's office.
   What Marion says she needs in order to work on her book could
also be what she needs to maintain her balance in the life she has
created: ``It requires that I really shut myself off from everything
but the work.''
   Hope's sadness forces Marion to confront her own passionless
life, and the possibilities for passion she rejected again and
again, primarily when she married Ken (Ian Holm) and rejected Ken's
best friend, Larry (Gene Hackman).
   The cast is terrific, and ``Another Woman'' is affecting, despite
Allen's tiresome focus on the neuroses of educated, white
Manhattanites. The scenes and the clothing are in brown, beige and
olive tones. And the movie is quiet, subdued and proper.

   ``Picasso Trigger'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   A movie that combines ``Charlie's Angels'' and James Bond can't
be all bad, but it can't be all good, either. ``Picasso Trigger''
features about a half dozen angels and hunks with bare chests, some
sex and lots of mayhem done with all sorts of neat goodies including
a rocket-launching crutch.
   It has a thin plot involving a drug lord's revenge against a
bunch of federal agents _ the angels and hunks _ who wipe-out the
gang.
   Actually, the plot is no thinner than that of the late TV show or
some of the Bond movies. However, the script by Andy Sidaris, who
also directed, is so bad that not even fast-paced action, pretty
scenery and clever electronics such as exploding toy cars and planes
can not make up for it.
   There is a cute but obvious twist at the end, which if the viewer
is paying attention to the story rather than the bodies, can be
predicted very early.
   In case you miss it because of the scenery, here's a brief
rundown.
   The film gets its name from a painting of a fish done in the
style of the famous artist. It's presented at a party given by a
drug rackets kingpin.
   But just after the presentation the kingpin is rubbed out ... or
was he? Not to worry, he gets his again when the rocket launched
from a crutch homes in on his pacemaker and KABOOM!
   The movie stars Donna Speir, Hope Marie Carlton, Steve Bond and
Harold Diamond. Yeah, right, you really know these actors. But
readers of Playboy magazine might have seen Speir and Carlton.

   ``Big Daddy'' (PolyGram) _ John Cougar Mellencamp
   
   After taking giant steps forward with his last two albums, John
Cougar Mellencamp consolidates his success with the deceptively
impressive ``Big Daddy.''
   The once-ridiculed Johnny Cougar set aside the snickers with
1985's hard-rocking ``Scarecrow,'' blending party tunes with pointed
commentary about the American Midwest. ``The Lonesome Jubilee'' was
musically adventurous, with Mellencamp adding a fiddle, accordion
and female singers to his basic rock combo.
   ``Big Daddy'' sounds far less ambitious _ a collection of songs
rather than a statement. But in doing so, Mellencamp affirms his own
maturation and the strengths of the band he has assembled.
   Mellencamp and his band sing and play with an understated warmth.
At times, John's talking as much as singing, and he never finds it
necessary to shout. On songs such as ``Mansions in Heaven,'' his
band only hints at the power it can unleash. The players sound
confident in their abilities, not straightjacketed by the songs.
   Lately, he's taken Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan as role models,
championing the causes of society's underdogs. ``Jackie Brown'' is
an elegant folk ballad about a poor man's life and death in the
countryside. In ``Martha Say,'' he sympathizes with a woman's
struggle for independence. ``Country Gentleman'' is a scorching
indictment of former President Reagan and his ``rich friends.''
   The singer's own aging is another constant theme _ Mellencamp
holds daughters Teddi Jo and Justice in album cover photos.
   About his only clear misstep is the single, ``Pop Singer,'' a
slight song in which Mellencamp insists he never wanted to be a pop
star. Well, why not? His own career contradicts that notion, as well
as the myth that a pop singer can't make real statements on causes
that mean something to him.
   With his work on ``Big Daddy,'' Mellencamp solidifies his
position alongside Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty as one of the
three best American rock band leaders in the 1980s.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Sammy Davis Jr. Back on the Boards</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking back on the ups, downs and excesses of
his 60-year career as an entertainer, Sammy Davis Jr. comments:
``I'm probably the only man who was Dr. Franenstein and the
monster.''
   A 60-year anniversary _ he started hoofing onstage at the age of
3 _ is cause for retrospection, and Davis was in a reflective mood.
He also has a new autobiography, ``Why Me?'' (Farrar, Straus,
Giroux, $18.95), an update of his 1965 memoir, ``Yes, I Can.'' He
talked openly about his years of excess as he sat at the bar of his
Holmby Hills home. Uncharacteristically, he was nursing a soft drink.
   ``I created my own monster,'' he said. ``Nobody put a gun to my
head and said, `You have to go over the top.' So I had to deal with
it. Once I had created this thing, I didn't like who I was.
   ``I didn't realize it at the time, and it took a bunch of years
of self-analysis. I've never gone to a shrink _ I'm not proud of
that statement. But there were no places for me to go, there was no
Betty Ford's or this or that. I had to do it myself.
   ``I miss booze,'' he admitted. ``There ain't no sense of me
lying. Bourbon and Coke _ oh, man, please! A bloody Mary on the
plane, that was it! I would get on the plane and before it took off
I had two bloody Marys. Or two salty dogs. Man, I'm ready. It can
crash now, I don't care.
   ``I always had to have the sip before I walked on the stage. That
was my reinforcement. I used to watch the guys go to the bathroom,
not knowing they were going for a hit. I never did that. I'd just
say, `Bartender, may I have some more of this?'''
   Davis quit drinking a dozen years ago because of cirrhosis of the
liver. He told of sitting on a hospital bed while his doctor
prepared to drain his bloated belly. ``If it comes out cloudy,
that's it: The bell's rung,'' said the doctor. He watched
breathlessly and saw that the fluid was _ clear.
   But by the time he kicked the booze, his career was on the skids.
``I had messed up so much in Vegas and Tahoe and other places that
it was hard to get the bookings,'' he recalled.
   His salary was cut because of his unreliability. ``I'd get on the
stage and I didn't know whether I did 40 minutes or an hour and 40.''
   After the boozing stopped, he played the Las Vegas Desert Inn for
four weeks with a full orchestra. The trade realized that Sammy
Davis Jr. was back.
   His career may have been repaired, but his finances were not. One
day Internal Revenue Service agents arrived at the Davis house to
announce that it was being placed on lien. His income tax bill
amounted to $2 million. His friends offered to help; Frank Sinatra
was ready to write a check. So was casino owner Bill Harrah.
   ``No,'' said Davis. ``Thank you very much, but I got to get out
of it.'' He reached a longterm agreement to repay the government
from his earnings.
   ``Why Me?'' tells the whole story: the constant touring as a kid
with his father and Will Mastin; the endless racial taunts;
membership in Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack; the violent reactions to his
romance with Kim Novak and his marriage to May Britt; the 1954 car
crash that cost him an eye; the connections with the Kennedys,
Richard Nixon and Martin Luther King; the enduring marriage to his
third wife, Altovise.
   Davis seems to remember everything, but of his show business
beginning 60 years ago, he is uncertain: ``It gets confusing. I
don't know what they've told me about and what the reality is.
   ``I do remember wearing long pants. I couldn't have been more
than 4 or 5. My dad and Will Mastin passed me off as a 44-year-old
midget. I had a rubber cigar in my mouth and they would treat me
like an adult. That was the only way we could get around the child
labor laws. There was something called the Gerry Society that was
strict on kids working.
   ``It worked for a couple of years until they got wise to us. Dad
and Will got busted when we were playing a burlesque house on 42nd
Street. Burlesque in those days was the poor man's Ziegfeld.''
   The major regret of his childhood was missing an eduation.
   ``I didn't have one day of formal education,'' said Davis. ``I
never sat in a classroom in my life. That's the one strict thing I
have with my kids: Get an education. Most of them went to junior
college, but at least they went. My daughter, Tracy, went to three
junior colleges; she's a professional go-to-schooler.''
   At 63, Davis is riding high. Earlier this year he made his first
screen appearance in a long time, drawing good reviews in ``Tap''
with Gregory Hines. He recently returned from a five-week sold-out
tour of Europe with Sinatra and Liza Minnelli. He mused about how
well behaved the three of them were:
   ``The only thing that upset the tour was Liza and her dog. (She
has been fined $2,000 for bringing her dog into Sweden illegally.)
We were all having dinner one night, and I said to Liza, `Now can
you imagine the three of us 15 years ago? They wouldn't have
mentioned the dog. We would have created so much tumult that the dog
would have been 27th on the list!'''
   In ``Tap'' and on the tour, Davis danced with his oldtime vigor,
an amazing feat for a man who underwent hip reconstruction 18 months
ago.
   All those years of pounding stage floors caught up with him in
his late 50s. Unable to withstand the pain, he underwent a ``patch
job'' to reconstruct the hip in 1985. He resumed performing, but the
pain returned. In January 1988 he returned to Cedars Sinai Medical
Center for an operation that replaced the femur with a prosthesis
and rebuilt the hip socket.
   ``I was off for 10 weeks,'' he said. ``I stayed in the hospital
an extra nine days because I wanted to be ambulatory when I came
home. I went from a walker to crutches to a cane. I had therapy,
which is the key to recovery. It started the day after the operation.
   ``Now I'm back and dancing. I can't dance the way I once did. But
I don't think any cat can do anything the way he used to do at 20.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Carmen Goes to Nimes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There will be gypsies and flamenco dancers but no
bullfight when Bizet's ``Carmen'' is staged next month in ancient
Nimes.
   The romantic opera starring mezzo-soprano Grace Bumbry is
expected to attract opera lovers, outdoor-theater lovers and lovers,
period, and promises to be the most exciting operatic event of
France's bicentennial year. Tenor Neil Shicoff co-stars as Don Jose,
and baritone Robert Hale will be Escamillo.
   Sets and costumes for the opera to be performed July 3, 5 and 7
are being designed by star couturier Christian Lacroix. Organizers
have not revealed the cost of the lavish production.
   The opera will be directed by Antoine Bourseiller who has been
director of the Opera-Theatre of Nancy since 1982, and an old hand
at ``Carmen'' with past productions in Nancy and Lausanne.
   The international production will also feature the Budapest
orchestra, the Bulgarian national choir, and a cast of over 100,
including 20 picadors on horseback to wind up the last act.
   ``But there will be no bull or corrida,'' Bourseiller said.
   Bullfights are still held twice a year in the well-preserved
Roman arena at Nimes, and a live bullfight following the opera had
been a Nimes tradition since the 19th century. In the years
following World War II, such great matadors as Ordonez, Nimeno, Paco
Camino and El Cordobes capped the musical performances with
bullfights.
   At times the spectaculars also included bands of gypsies,
flamenco dancers, circus numbers and ballet performances. But in
recent years the bullfight was dropped to focus on the opera
masterpiece itself, and as a concession to animal-rights advocates.
   ``As a boy I saw `Carmen' with bullfights,'' said Lacroix, who is
from nearby Arles. ``She was my first love, a very sexy lady.'' The
designer relishes the idea of dressing up Miss Bumbry to look far
more splendid than the down-and-out gypsy cigarette girl so often
seen in productions of the fiery opera.
   ``But it will not look like a fashion show,'' he said. Miss
Bumbry will be clad in colors to suit the drama: carnation pink for
the cabaret scenes; earth colors for the smugglers' scene; black and
silver for the death scene in the final act.
   He is currently working on designs for sets within the arena,
which will seat about 10,000 for the opera.
   ``The site itself is so spectacular you don't need much
scenery,'' Lacroix said. ``We'll be building simple elements to
suggest the mountains, soldiers' garrison, cabaret and so on.''
   Bourseiller said his production will be as true as possible to
the spirit of Bizet, who based his scenario on a tale by Prosper
Merimee. ``Merimee's Carmen was a 16-year-old,'' he said. ``But
obviously we don't want to show her as an adolescent.''
   Miss Bumbry, 52, has received rave reviews for her interpretation
of the sultry Gypsy courtesan in Paris, Rome and Dallas, and in a
screen version directed by Herbert von Karajan.
   ``I have not yet met Miss Bumbry,'' said Bourseiller, ``but
having seen her perform, I admire her and think she is perhaps the
only mezzo suited to both the drama and the difficult outdoor
singing.''
   Carmen has been mounted and acted in hundreds of versions,
including Peter Brook's iconoclastic ``The Tragedy of Carmen,'' a
stark production with a pared-down cast of seven in a dilapidated
setting. This style raised both critical protest and praise when it
came out in Paris and New York in the early 1980s, and last month in
Glasgow.
   ``Brook's version is wonderful in a special setting, such as an
old warehouse,'' said Bourseiller. But his favorite is the steamy
1983 film version by Francesco Rosi starring Julia Migenes-Johnson
and Placido Domingo.
   A part of the Nimes summer festival, ``Carmen'' promises to be
the most spectacular of the operas mounted since 1983, when musical
activities in the arena were resumed after a hiatus of more than 15
years.
   The impressive amphitheater was built by the Romans in the first
century B.C.
   Bourseiller says he can offer has no details yet on what sort of
Carmen character will result from his collaboration with Grace
Bumbry. Rehearsals started June 16.
   ``Our only problem may be the weather. It can get very hot down
there, but we'll begin after sunset, which should help,'' he said.
   ``And then, there's the Mistral,'' he added, referring to the
mighty wind that sometimes comes howling down the Rhone Valley,
bringing blue skies but sometimes hot tempers as well.
   ``The acoustics are excellent in the arena. But the wind creates
a terrible handicap for singers.''

   While growing up in the Scottish village of
Auchtermuchty, Craig and Charlie Reid listened to Frank Sinatra, Ray
Charles and Jim Reeves.
   With their close-cropped hair and horned-rimmed glasses, the Reid
twins could pass for a new-age version of the 1960s English pop duo,
Peter and Gordon. But as The Proclaimers, the brothers erase all
doubts about their Scottish roots.
   ``I think our strength is in being ourselves and not
compromising,'' said Charlie Reid, the guitarist and backing
vocalist for the folk-rock duo. The group has released its second
album, ``Sunshine on Leith.''
   ``In England, which I felt would be the hardest, the album's gone
platinum. We've done it through working and performances. It may
take longer but the process will be worth it. We'll find out a lot
about America and ourselves.''
   The Reids have been best friends all their lives and took pains
in a recent interview to single each other out for priase. As
children, they dreamed of performing together and finally took the
step at 16 when Craig acquired a drum kit and Charlie learned to
play guitar.
   ``It was natural for us that we'd be in the same band,'' said
Charlie, who deferred to his brother as the superior singer. ``I've
got a harsher style; Craig's is better. To some extent the voices
have been shaped that way because I tend to do the backup and the
high harmonies while Craig sings lead.''
   Craig remembered their first time on stage, playing at a local
village hall.
   ``I think one of our songs was by John Lee Hooker, `Boom, Boom.'
We did a Clash song and we may have done soemthing else,'' he said.
``We were very scared. People knew you very well, and they don't
think you can play music. It was very noisy, but it was great.''
   The Reids fronted a punk-rock group before deciding in 1983 to
form an act of their own, naming themselves The Proclaimers and
playing acoustic sets. They headed for London, hoping for a
contract, but were not well received by the English record companies.
   ``They were hinting that if we sang in our own accents, it may be
difficult for people to understand what we were writing about,''
Craig said. ``They said they couldn't sign us because of that.''
   But in 1986, The Housemartins, a popular British band, heard a
tape of The Proclaimers and made them the opening act on their next
tour. The Reids were eventually signed by Chrysalis Records.
   Their first record, ``This Is the Story,'' came out the following
year and featured the single, ``Letter From America,'' a hit in
England. The Reids also celebrated their native accent in ``Throw
the `R' Away.''
   ``A lot of Scots try to get their children's voices to be very
proper, not have them use Scot words,'' Craig said. ``They said you
wouldn't be able to work in England if you do that.''
   The Reids did not use a backing band for their debut album, but
have a wide range of musicians on ``Sunshine on Leith,'' which
features guitars, drums, bass, keyboards, mandolin, fiddle, melodeon
and penny whistle.
   ``We've always liked different sounds,'' Craig said. ``We've
always considered a record where you could do something a bit
different. The music could be anything we wanted. Having a joke,
having a laugh, not taking it too seriously.''
   Gerry Hogan's steel guitar is featured on ``My Old Friend the
Blues,'' a country weeper written by Steve Earle. The Proclaimers
also covered an Earle song on their first album and count themselves
as major country music fans.
   ``I think that any real interest in Scotch and Irish music comes
through our interest in country music,'' Craig said. ``A real thread
of Appalachian and bluegrass music runs through Scotch music. It
awakens your own identity.''
   Craig also praised folk and country lyrics, insisting that they
cover a broader range of subjects.
   ``Basically in rock 'n' roll you write about love and sex and
maybe a couple of political songs, and that is the limit. You don't
write about children, family, places.''
   The remaining 11 songs on ``Sunshine on Leith,'' all written by
the Reids, are a mixture of love, politics and family. ``Sean'' is
about Charlie's baby son. ``What Do You Do'' and ``Cap in Hand''
criticize Scotland's bleak economic condition.
   ``Oh Jean,'' written for a friend of Craig's, closes their live
shows, with the Reids chanting ``I Love Her, I Love Her,'' working
themselves and the audience into a frenzy.
   ``We did a double bill once and we went on and we weren't getting
much of a reaction until we did that one,'' Craig recalled. ``We
tore the place apart.''
   ``You can go as long as you want,'' Charlie said. ``You know the
feeling when it's reached the end. You go into another frame of
mind, not like a trance, but you do try to summon up a primal
energy.''

<HEAD>Gov't Plans First Study Of Hanford Releases' Health Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the nation rushed to build atomic
bombs during World War II and the Cold War, few thought the work
might eventually prove more dangerous to the U.S. citizens living
near the weapons factories.
   As the Hanford nuclear reservation produced much of the plutonium
for the nuclear arsenal, radioactive wastes escaped into the air
from smokestacks or were dumped into the adjacent Columbia River.
   ``In the early history of Hanford, there were exposures to the
public. Nobody argues with that,'' said Jim Ruttenber of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control. Forty-five years after the first
emissions, the government is making its first attempt to learn if
they hurt people in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.
   The Department of Energy's Hanford Environmental Dose
Reconstruction Project is under way to estimate the possible
radiation doses residents might have received, and similar studies
are being done at the Nevada Test Site, the uranium processing plant
at Fernald, Ohio, and other sites. The CDC is about to launch a
study of thyroid disease rates, a $1.5 project that will focus on a
group of 300 people at greatest risk from exposure to radioactive
iodine.
   For the scientists, the issues include dose reconstruction,
environmental transport, source terms, uncertainty analyses and
other jargon.
   But for Hanford's ``downwinders,'' the issue is damaged lives.
   ``Myself and five other members of my family all have
hypothyroidism,'' said Judith Jurji, whose father and two uncles
were Hanford welders from 1949 to 1956. Ms. Jurji, 43, believes the
disease, which slows the body's metabolism and robs a person of
vigor, was caused by Hanford emissions.
   Only the branch of her family that moved to eastern Washington,
around Hanford, has any trace of thyroid disease, Ms. Jurji said.
   The downwinders are prohibited by law from suing the federal
government or its contractors, and even if they could sue it would
be extremely difficult to prove a long-term illness was caused by
radiation exposure 40 years ago, said Jim Thomas of the Hanford
Education Action League, a citizens watchdog group.
   The first step in trying to link health problems to emissions is
dose reconstruction, an elaborate attempt to estimate how much
radiation might have reached people, mostly during the 1940s. The
federal government has estimated over 435,000 curies of radioactive
material was released into the atmosphere over Hanford in 1945-1947.
Three Mile Island released just 15 to 24 curies.
   But dose reconstruction isn't concerned with individual illness.
The $15 million, 5-year DOE study will estimate possible radiation
doses to the public. That will be done by meticulous examination of
such things as milk production, because radioactive iodine-131
settled on grass eaten by cows; weather, because radioactive
material was scattered for hundreds of miles by wind; and outdoor
recreation patterns, because exposure is greatest outdoors.
   The study has been attacked as not credible by some downwinders
because it is being done by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory, a
major DOE contractor.
   Ms. Jurji said she is also dissatisfied by how long the work will
take, and what she perceives as the wrong attitude of the
scientists, who she said were too dispassionate at a recent
downwinder conference in Spokane.
   ``Not one person said one word of sympathy or indicated any sort
of compassion,'' she said. ``They were looking like the kind of
scientists who might have given us the problems in the first place.''
   The CDC study will try to determine if there are higher rates of
thyroid disease in the region, and whether that is caused by
iodine-131, which attacks the thyroid. But even that won't yield
conclusive answers in individual cases.
   ``There is no way of measuring or detecting how somebody got
cancer,'' Thomas said. ``A lot of health effects are separated from
the exposure by 20 to 40 years.''
   Delbert Barth of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, a member of
an independent panel overseeing the dose reconstruction project,
said at a recent meeting that it is wrong to think the study will
produce a firm number for radiation exposure the public received.
   There will only be estimates, with wide margins of error,
scientists say.
   Hanford was built in south central Washington in 1943 during the
Manhattan Project. The world's first full-sized nuclear plant, B
Reactor, was erected in a frenzied 15 months, and produced plutonium
for the Nagasaki bomb. Seven other plutonium reactors built along
the Columbia in the 1940s and '50s, all are shut permanently. A
ninth reactor, the N Reactor, was built in 1963 and is closed
because of a plutonium surplus.
   The releases were revealed when the Energy Department released
19,000 pages of previously classified documents in 1986.
   Most of the early releases were deliberate, from normal nuclear
operations for the time. But one release, the 1949 ``Green Run,'' is
notorious because an unknown amount of radioactivity was released so
its path could be charted.
   The term ``Green Run'' refers to faster processing of irradiated
nuclear fuel into plutonium. It was processed after just 16 days of
cooling, instead of the normal 40. The exact mission of the research
is unknown, though scientists have said it was to aid in monitoring
nuclear production in the Soviet Union.
   No one knows exactly how much was released, although recent
estimates are about 8,000 curies, twice what experimenters
originally planned.
   Much of the ``Green Run'' report remains classified.
   ``The main answer we are still looking for is why the Green Run
was done, who authorized it and how could it happen in a democratic
society,'' Thomas said. He wonders why the public wasn't told to
take precautions _ like staying indoors and evacuating pregnant
women _ during the December 1949 experiment.
   The dose reconstruction project's initial report is due early
next year and will deal with 10 counties in eastern Washington and
northeastern Oregon, said John Till, head of the oversight panel. It
will cover 1944-49 releases into the air, and 1963-64 releases of
cooling water into the Columbia River.
   Radiation releases aren't a thing of the past at the
560-square-mile site. While off-site radiation is negligible, 50
million gallons of radioactive and hazardous waste from plutonium
processing is still dumped each day.

<HEAD>Accentuating The Positive Helps In Room Near Cancer Ward</HEAD>

   Past the doors of the dying, in a brightly
colored room in the cancer ward, people smile, music plays and the
sun shines in.
   ``It is a happy area,'' said Sandra Yates, the unit's head nurse.
``You don't see people walking by with long faces like you might at
a funeral home. Family members are not afraid to come to the
hospital. They might not look forward to it, but to me that sets it
off.
   ``If they aren't afraid to be here then we are doing our job.''
   Welcome to the Lively Room, where The Three Stooges, W.C. Fields
and the kids from Our Gang do their stuff on a 54-inch TV screen,
and there are a player piano, tapes of old radio shows and
scrapbooks of cartoons.
   Since DeKalb Medical Center opened the Lively Room in 1982, it's
been the scene of countless parties, recitals, and at least one
wedding.
   ``It helps, it really does,'' said Rachel Blackstone of suburban
Atlanta who spends all of each day in the ward with her terminally
ill mother. ``That hospital room gets mighty small after a while.
   ``It eases the mental strain. Sometimes I go from here down to
the second floor to look at the new babies. The room maintains an
upbeat feeling.''
   The idea of emotions' effect on health isn't new. In the 1400s,
surgeon Henri de Mondeville told his patients jokes, thinking the
levity would speed recovery. The concept has won more credence, but
even in the 1960s, Ms. Yates said, over 80 percent of emotion
studies centered on the negative.
   ``Positive emotions were thought to have no purpose. Now we're
making inroads in positive emotions,'' she said, adding that they
have been shown to produce enzyme and hormone changes that help
people cope.
   Board member W.W. ``Walsh'' Lively donated $15,000 to start the
room, but it was inspired by former Saturday Review editor Norman
Cousins. He checked out of a hospital and into a hotel with an
armload of ``Candid Camera'' reruns, and credited belly laughs and
vitamin C for beating a debilitating illness.
   ``We have seen patients who thought they would never go out of
here but they did make it out, they did go home again even if it was
only for a short period of time,'' Ms. Yates said. ``It is a good,
sound medical practice with positive results.'' Nonetheless, ``We
have to make sure it is therapeutic for the patients and doesn't
make things worse for them.''
   The stress of most cancer wards, she said, usually causes a high
turnover among nurses; at DeKalb it is the lowest in the hospital.
The junior nurse on the day shift, for example, has been there five
years.
   ``No matter what the condition we see people as living
individuals with needs. If we keep that in perspective it is all
very normal to us,'' Ms. Yates said. Many people are alert to the
very end and when they accept their disease and the outcome, they
say they are ready to go ... We tell them, `It's not time yet. Let's
make today the best it can be.'''
   It's important, she said, to respond immediately to any
opportunity.
   ``We had a woman who had taught dance and she said she really
wished she could teach one more class. We couldn't do the class but
we got a ballet tape she could critique, so she could have some
input.''
   ``A 77-year-old patient said she couldn't understand why she was
still here but if she was still going to be here she wanted her hair
colored one more time. Yesterday we colored her hair. Today she
asked that her nails be polished.
   ``These things may not seem important but they give hope and
that's what it's all about. You can talk about hope until you're
blue in the face but you have to give something meaningful.
   ``If someone wants a picnic, set the date for tomorrow. You can't
put things off. Especially here.''

<HEAD>Taste Scientists Study What It Is That Gives Food Flavor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this health-conscious age, most people
want to know the ingredients in the food they're eating. John
Sherbon and Harry Lawless want to know what's in the ingredients.
   But Sherbon and Lawless, Cornell University food scientists,
aren't driven by health; they want to determine what makes food
taste the way it does.
   It's an area that is increasingly crucial in the food industry.
   ``I'm not sure it's possible to get anyone to try green eggs and
ham, but our job involves trying to learn what it is about green
eggs that puts people off, and maybe find a way to make them more
appealing,'' said Sherbon.
   Away from the public eye _ and mind _ food scientists work on
ways to improve what Americans eat. That not only means making it
taste better, but improving quality, processing, storage, stability,
nutrients and safety.
   ``When consumers buy a food product and eat it, they decide
whether they like it based on the product as a whole,'' Lawless said
at Cornell's new, $6 million Food Processing and Development
Laboratory.
   ``They do not necessarily look at the individual qualities of the
food such as color, taste, aroma and texture under a microscope.
However, scientists look at the individual pieces of the food
puzzle, trying to figure out what makes consumers like one product
and dislike another.''
   In the world of big business, that's a mighty tool, said John W.
Finley of Nabisco Brands Inc., in East Hanover, N.J. ``It's
important because no matter how much you spend on advertising and
marketing, people eat foods because of their flavor. If it's not
tasty, it's not desirable. It's that simple.''
   A more basic role for taste scientists is to ensure a food tastes
the same no matter where it's made or its ingredients come from, he
said. ``When you're dealing with agricultural commodities grown in
half a dozen states, the flavor can be extremely variable.
   ``You want an Oreo cookie to taste the same in Syracuse as it
does in Miami. Consumers have certain expectations when they pick up
a product. They're incredibly sensitive to change. And if they don't
like it, they probably won't buy it again.''
   Early flavor analysis _ the science goes back to Louis Pasteur,
according to Sherbon _ was limited to tasting and smelling by human
observers. They would sample food as scientists watched and recorded
their observations and comments. ``Sensory evaluation has come a
long way since the days of the tongue and palate approach,'' said
Lawless, who has a background in psychology. ``Not everything is as
easy as the Pepsi Challenge would have you believe.''
   Sensory panels continue to play a major role, said John
Vercellotti, a research chemist with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service regional center in New
Orleans. The center, one of five in the nation, has had panelists
evaluate such foods as beef, catfish and peanuts.
   ``No matter how advanced the science gets, these machines are
only replicating what the nose and mouth do,'' said Vercellotti.
``There will always be a place for them because people are the
ultimate consumers and the ultimate decision-makers as to what
tastes good.''
   The panels can be fairly objective because assessments are made
as a group, usually from parameters established with the help of
computers, he said. ``It's kind of like an a cappella choir that
sings with absolute pitch. You don't have all the same voice. You
have many voices and they may be very different, but collectively
you come out with one harmonious sound.''
   What modern science has been able to do is take assessment a step
further by pinpointing the chemical or chemicals that give a food a
distinctive taste. One of the more recent developments in this area
is ``charm'' analysis, which uses high-resolution gas chromatography
to isolate flavor-active chemicals. It involves a person sitting in
front of a chromatograph, sniffing emissions and having their
responses recorded by a computer.
   The name derives from the definition of charm, which is a
property that attracts people, said Terry Acree, a chemist at
Cornell's laboratory in Geneva. Through charm analysis scientists
can tell precisely what makes a Concord grape taste different than
other varieties or a Cortland apple than a Rome.
   ``We work in anonymity,'' said Sherbon, ``but the consumer would
be the first to know if we weren't doing our job.''

<HEAD>Eagle Carries Satellite Transmitter in Tracking Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULLAHOOMA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young eagle carrying a 5-ounce
transmitter is helping develop techniques to track ships, stolen
cars or even prison inmates.
   ``We want to show that it can be done, that we can track
something the size of an eagle and for a reasonable cost,'' said
Carey Roberts, a researcher at the University of Tennessee Space
Institute. The transmitter costs $3,500, and time on a French
weather satellite is about $500 a month.
   The two-year project, using a French weather satellite, is a
joint venture of the university and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources
Agency, which hopes to learn more about the travel patterns of bald
eagles.
   The 1-year-old eagle, a male named Phoenix, was released at
Reelfoot Lake near Tiptonville, on May 31. It is the first of
several eagles, perhaps as many as 12, expected to eventually take
part in the project, said Bob Hatcher, endangered species
coordinator for the TWRA.
   The solar-powered transmitter strapped to the eagle's back will
send signals twice a day to a commercial satellite called Argos,
which will relay the signals to a ground station in France, which
will relay them to a station in Maryland. From there, the
information can be picked up by the University of Tennessee's
researchers using desktop computers.
   The first signals are expected in Tullahoma within a week or so,
Roberts said. Many of the signals may miss the satellite, depending
on its position, but impulses will be picked up about once a day.
   The project could show that satellite tracking can be used to
keep up with freight trains, transport ships and even cars, she
said. A number of states use electronic tracking devices to keep up
with parolees, but the range of that equipment is limited.
   ``With these, anywhere they went in the world, we could find
them,'' Roberts said.

<HEAD>Research Throws New Light On Volcanic Eruptions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violent volcanic eruptions may be caused
by sealed vents rather than by zones of water and volatile gases in
magma as previously thought, say scientists who studied California's
600-year-old Obsidian Dome.
   ``This changes the way we think about magma chambers and suggests
magmas may be more uniformly gas rich and not as zoned as we thought
before,'' said geologist John C. Eichelberger of Sandia National
Laboratories.
   Violent eruptions have been explained by the influence of water
vapor and volatile gases in the upper zone of a magma chamber, deep
beneath the Earth's surface. The theory says trapped gases expand as
magma is forced into lower-pressure regions near the surface,
causing explosions.
   The violent eruption creates a funnel-shaped opening which
collects debris, filling the vent through which subsequent magma
must pass. The porous rubble is like a sand pile, keeping pressure
on the magma but letting gas leak out before drier magma reaches the
surface, where its lower pressure results in a flow.
   Sandia's study suggests magma acts as a sponge that can leak gas
as it rises to the surface. Fractured rock in the volcanic vent
allows gas to escape from the magma, releasing pressure and causing
less violent eruptions.
   The Obsidian Dome volcano contains a magma tube within a broader
vent. The vent contains debris from the initial explosive eruption
and the dome was built of lava that flowed over several weeks.
Chemical studies showed the same magma caused the explosion and the
dome-building, and that the material that built the dome lost most
of its gas before reaching the surface.
   Magma that is 65 percent to 75 percent silica has silica-rich
molecules which tend to chain together and drastically increase the
resistance to flow, or viscosity. Silica-rich magma can be up to
100,000 times more viscous _ thicker _ than basalt magma that are 40
percent to 50 percent silica.
   Because silica-rich magma is thicker, bubbles can't rise out of
it and escape, and gas remains trapped. Charles R. Carrigan of
Sandia said if bubbles can't escape, magma with as little as 3
percent gas will expand several hundred times when it reaches the
surface, resulting in an explosion.

<HEAD>Study: Some Traits Shared By Sex Offenders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The typical male sex offender is passive, has
low self-esteem and looks down on other sex offenders, according to
a researcher who has drawn 14 common characteristics from 10 years
of treating offenders.
   Seventy percent of 56 offenders studied had 11 of the traits, and
83 percent had eight, said Margretta Dwyer, coordinator of sex
offender treatment at the University of Minnesota. Dwyer said the
traits, to be published in the Journal of Psychology &amp; Human
Sexuality, should help in developing treatment.
   But she emphasized that more research is needed, with control
groups made up of those who don't commit sex offenses.
   Dwyer's subjects ranged in age from 20 to 82. Eighty percent were
incest offenders or pedophiles. Thirty-four were married.
   Sex offenders grow up ``learning to be passive,'' Dwyer wrote.
``Passivity is their way of interacting with life ... encouraged by
the over-protective mother and@or wife who makes decisions for
them. Offenders tend to attract partners who will mother them.''
   Other traits:
   The typical male sex offender is manipulative. He has to be
tricky to keep from being discovered. His relationship with his
father, if he knew his father, was lousy. His mother worried
constantly about his health and safety.
   He's angry, but keeps his anger bottled up. Other adults
intimidate him. He tries to hold back his sexual thoughts in an
effort to keep from committing sex crimes. He often believes someone
other than himself is committing the act.
   He takes little or no responsibility, preferring to believe that
some outside force causes him to do bad things. One child molester
said: ``She just happened to be in my bed that day.'' Another said:
``I had had too much coffee that day and coffee always makes me do
things I would never otherwise do.'' A third said: ``I had too much
sugar in my system that day.''
   Typical offenders have ``little knowledge of how to ask women for
a date, to receive feedback from partners or to have fun on a
date.'' Fifty-nine percent of Dwyer's subjects had few social or
sexual skills.
   Thirty-six percent recalled being sexually abused as children,
and 40 percent had upsetting sexual experiences around age 4.
   Strict religious codes figured in the offenses of 26 percent.

   Next fall's tuitions are soaring for the ninth
straight year at many colleges and universities. And freshmen at a
number of top-notch schools will get a double dose of bad news.
   In a new twist, schools such as the University of Chicago, Johns
Hopkins University, Duke University, Seton Hall University and
George Washington University are setting tuition increases for
freshmen roughly double those being imposed on upperclassmen.
   The new, higher rates will become the base, and lower rates
charged to upperclassmen will be ``grandfathered,'' or phased out.
   The schools give differing explanations for their decisions to
hit freshmen harder.
   Seton Hall will charge freshmen 19.6 percent more next fall,
while upperclass tuition will go up 10.8 percent.
   Johns Hopkins set tuition increases of 16.6 percent for freshmen,
to $14,000, and 8.3 percent for returning students, to $13,000. Its
school of arts and sciences is struggling with a projected $2
million deficit.
   But John V. Lombardi, vice president and provost, said the
primary drive was that Johns Hopkins found itself priced at least
$1,000 below other top schools, and it wanted to catch up as quickly
as possible without angering students.
   ``The needed increase is really larger than normal, and you try
to be fair to existing students,'' he said. That's why his school
spared upperclassmen double-digit rate hikes, but not freshmen.
   Duke had a different explanation: a desire to hire more faculty
and lower student-teacher ratios from the current 13-1 to 11-1.
   Duke pioneered the two-tiered tuition system a year ago along
with the University of Chicago. This year, Duke freshmen will be
charged $12,800 for tuition, while returning students will pay
$11,350.
   ``The idea was to fund academic improvements and enhancements,''
said Duke spokesman Dave Roberson. ``The thinking was that students
who were here already wouldn't benefit in time for most of those
enhancements to be in place.''
   At George Washington, for example, freshmen will see their fees
rise by 20.1 percent, or $2,000, to $11,500. Returning sophomores,
juniors and seniors will be hit with only a 10 percent hike.
   Library acquisition costs rose 30-50 percent last year, said
Robert A. Chernak, vice president for student and academic support
services. Such costs, along with a 6 percent rise in faculty
salaries, were key factors behind the $2 million operating deficit
that led to next fall's mammoth tuition increase.
   But the large freshman tuition increases also seem to be an
effort by some schools to raise big bucks while keeping protests to
a minimum. Freshmen, after all, are paying tuition for the first
time. For them, a big tuition increase isn't as likely to be
perceived as a change for the worse.
   Still, while it may be highly unlikely that students at Duke,
Hopkins or other top private schools would stage angry tuition
protests similar to those that greeted the University of Oklahoma
and City University of New York recently, higher education spokesmen
say there's increasing sensitivity to the issue of outrageous
tuition hikes.
   Tuitions at both public and private institutions had shot up in
double digits from 1981 to 1984 but had moderated somewhat in the
last three years. In 1988-89, they were up an average of 5 percent
at publics and 9 percent at privates, according to the College Board.
   But signs are that the moderating trend may be over, at least for
next fall. Schools are declaring tuition hikes ranging from 7-15
percent.
   Tuitions at public research universities rose from an average of
$549 in 1973 to $1,701 in 1988, a 210 percent increase, according to
a just-published report by the Denver-based State Higher Education
Executive Officers.
   The increases during that 15-year period were greatest in the
South _ 234 percent _ and smallest in the Northeast _ 209 percent,
the report found.
   And economists see no signs that upward pressure will end any
time soon.
   ``I see trends that have been going on for a decade that are not
moderating: the need for financial aid, the rising cost of library
acquisitions, the need to improve salaries,'' said Richard Rosser,
president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities in Washington.
   At Cornell University, which has announced a tuition increase of
roughly 7 percent for this fall, financial aid costs will reach
$17.8 million, compared with just $5.1 million in 1981, according to
spokesman Sam Segal.
   Overall, the nation's private colleges are spending $3.5 billion
on financial aid, compared with $900 million in 1979, a fact Rosser
blamed on cuts in federal aid programs.
   Meanwhile, public universities had moderated their average
tuition hikes to 5-6 percent in the last several years, compared
with increases that reached a high of 20 percent in 1982-3. But
higher education officials note growing sentiment in many states,
especially those with budgetary problems, to boost students' share
of the cost of public college.
   On average, tuition and fees cover just 25-33 percent of the cost
of an education at a public university, compared to about 80 percent
at a private college, said Robert Aaron, a spokesman for the
National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges.
   ``It is fair to say that states in fiscal stress are looking for
ways to diminish their higher education burden and are looking for
students and parents to pay a larger share,'' Aaron said.

   If President Bush had his druthers, all parents
would have the right to choose the public school their child
attends. But it's a controversial vision that makes some people
nervous.
   With little money available to sink into education, Bush is
promoting concepts that may help him fulfill his campaign pledge to
be the ``education president'' without making new demands on the
federal treasury _ choice foremost among them.
   At a White House workshop held before he took office, Bush called
public school choice ``the single most promising idea'' in education
today. And Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos refers to choice as the
cornerstone of education reform.
   Against this backdrop of high-level exhortation, scores of
districts and state legislatures across the country are enacting or
at least discussing various types of open enrollment plans.
   Some, like Minnesota's pioneering plan, allow parents to choose
schools in any district in the state while others, such as a highly
successful East Harlem, N.Y., program, are confined to a single
district. Some plans rely heavily on magnet schools. Some provide
transportation and others do not.
   A major defeat occurred in New Mexico when a state Senate
committee killed a statewide choice plan. But setbacks have been the
exception, not the rule.
   At least two states, Arkansas and Iowa, have followed Minnesota's
lead and enacted open enrollment programs allowing students to
attend any school in the state. Nearly two dozen states this year
were studying or considering similar comprehensive choice proposals
or narrower ones that apply to dropouts, upperclassmen or at-risk
students.
   In a series of steps designed to fuel the movement, Cavazos
appointed a special adviser and task force to promote and evaluate
choice projects. He said he would hold regional conferences on
choice strategies and give top priority to choice projects in
awarding education innovation grants.
   The theory behind public school choice is that it gives parents
more control over their children's education and at the same time
creates competition that will theoretically shake up and improve bad
schools.
   But reactions among educators and even parents have been mixed.
Some predict logistical nightmares and soaring transportation costs;
others wonder if it is possible to ensure equity under an open
enrollment system _ whether some inner-city schools will be
virtually abandoned to those least able to take advantage of their
new options.
   ``It's a very complicated issue,'' Harvard education professor
Sara Lawrence Lightfoot said recently. ``We have to think about
making knowledge about schools available to everyone.''
   Lightfoot said the concern is that better educated, higher status
people will have more information and make better choices for their
children. She described a scenario where ``the brighter, more
capable, more affluent people are drawn to a certain setting. The
cream is taken from the milk and the others are left behind.''
   Leaders of the two teacher unions have expressed cautious
optimism about school choice, provided there are safeguards to make
sure deprived children are not further penalized. Some of the
strongest reservations are found among administrators and school
board presidents.
   A survey of the board presidents earlier this year found that
only 36 percent believed parents should be able to select their
child's school; that compares to 71 percent of the public who
supported the idea in a 1987 Gallup poll.
   ``In essence, the secretary's approach would do the least for
those who have the least,'' charged Richard Miller, executive
director of the American Association of School Administrators, after
Cavazos had announced his choice initiatives.
   In a speech this year to newspaper editors, Cavazos made a
special point of saying any public school choice program must be
``very, very sensitive to equity in the system'' by upgrading ghetto
schools and making transportation available to poor students who opt
to go elsewhere.
   If schools are unacceptable, he said, states should take them
over or shut them down.
   Several weeks later he told education writers that districts are
already spending enormous amounts of money and should divert some of
it to transportation if they are serious about choice.
   The Minnesota plan does not provide transportation. However,
Cavazos remarked that some of the students there ``would drive 100
miles on their own to go to the school of their choice.''
   Cavazos is fervent about school choice at least partly because he
considers himself an early beneficiary of the idea. Where he grew up
on a Texas ranch, he said, there were three local schools _ one for
blacks, one for Hispanics and one for Anglos.
   ``The Anglo (school) had the best education program, anyone could
see it,'' he told education writers this year. So his father, the
ranch foreman, got Cavazos and his siblings into the Anglo school.
``How he did it, I don't know,'' the secretary said. ``I consider
that to be the first example of choice.''

   Many parents who try to teach their
children to read should offer them a good book and a soft shoulder
rather than flash-card drill sessions, says an authority on reading.
   ``We need to have better parent education,'' says Claudia
Cornett, associate professor of education at Wittenberg University.
``Parents do not understand what is involved.''
   Ms. Cornett says parents are sincere but often misguided when
they emphasize what they think is the means to successful reading.
   ``They will pick out a little piece like phonics, for example, or
drill the kids on the alphabet,'' she says. ``That's such a limited
view.''
   At the other extreme, she says, are parents who simply don't care.
   ``Theirs is a crime of omission,'' says Ms. Cornett. ``They're
not doing anything. They're not reading to their kids.''
   Ms. Cornett says parents must learn to lay the foundation for
reading.
   ``They need to read to them, and I don't mean just to get it
done,'' she says. ``I mean they have to read with enthusiasm. This
should not be a chore. Good children's literature should be just as
enjoyable to an adult as it is to a child.''
   Ms. Cornett says parents must also interact with their children,
discuss stories they read and ask them questions about it.
   Even reading to children as young as 2 years old exposes them to
the ``music of the language'' and allows them to pick up some
concepts offered by the illustrations, she says.
   ``Probably the most important thing that's happening is that
you're giving him a positive association with the act of reading,''
she says. ``You're close, you're warm, you're hugging, smiling,
you're together. If children came to school loving being read to,
half the job of the teacher would be done.''
   Ms. Cornett was instrumental in setting up the Wittenberg Reading
Center. The facility aims at teaching reading for meaning while
keeping it enjoyable. The method involves drama, art, music,
creative writing, riddles, jokes and the use of tape recorders.
   Ms. Cornett says worksheets, dittos and other drill-like
activities in the classroom can be deadly to children's creativity
and blunt their interest in reading. The teaching method either
``liberates'' a child's creativity or ``confines and kills it,'' she
says.
   She says learning to read is not grounded in printed symbols, but
rather is the ability to listen to ideas.
   ``Reading is a thinking activity,'' she says. ``You absolutely
cannot read and understand things that aren't a part of your
experience.''
   She says children must be permitted and encouraged to play, which
allows them to learn about their environment and to discover
relationships.
   ``Reading is grounded in thinking, so they have to have all of
these experiences,'' she says. ``It's about those kinds of
experiences that eventually children will be reading. And unless
they have that background, they cannot understand it.''
   Ms. Cornett received Wittenberg University's 1989 Alumni
Association Award for Distinguished Teaching. She has delivered more
than 200 speeches around the country and has written eight books on
reading.
   She says that even more than illiteracy, she is concerned about
people who can read, but don't.
   ``That's very disturbing,'' she says, adding that recent
statistics show that 90 percent of the library books are checked out
by 5 percent of the population.
   ``We can't just teach people to read,'' she says. ``We have to
have people realize the purpose of it _ to enjoy, to get
information, to solve problems. That whole idea of purpose is so
critical to motivation.''
   Ms. Cornett says that while television isn't generally an
interactive experience, a certain amount of it can be educational
for children. She cited recent studies showing that children who
watch too much television and those that watch none at all are both
at a disadvantage.
   ``An hour a day, really, can be an advantage,'' she said. ``It's
familiarizing children with a lot of things people discuss, common
culture kinds of things. The concern is the extremes.''

   A prime weapon against illiteracy is the computer.
   Far from being a rich child's toy, the machine is touching
children in all reaches of society, freeing teachers for one-on-one
attention for students and helping unlock the written word to many
from illiterate backgrounds.
   The state of Mississippi, with one of the highest rates of
illiteracy in the nation, is putting computers into every school in
the state in an effort to teach basic reading and writing skills to
every child. The first computers will be in classrooms this fall,
and all elementary schools in the state will be equipped within four
years.
   The state is using the ``Writing to Read'' program developed by a
retired educator, John Henry Martin, and produced and marketed by
IBM. The company says it has been put into at least 5,000 schools
across the country, helping an estimated one million school children.
   In designing the program, which uses computers, audio cassettes,
and typewriters, Martin sought to replicate the comfortable
interaction of the one-room schoolhouse. His own experience as a
young teacher and with his later research into how children learn
convinced him that a less structured atmosphere, not bound off by
age and set curriculum, encourages children to learn better, at
their own pace.
   Moving from one ``work station'' to the next, children first
learn basic phonemes, or letter-sound combinations, through
computers and earphones; familiar objects are illustrated and
matched to written and oral words. Audio tapes at the next work
station reinforce what they've learned at the computer, and the
following one, the library station, familiarizes them with written
English. They then use this knowledge to write stories based on
their own oral language at the writing@typing station. At the final
station, children experiment with new combinations of letters and
words to develop word-building skills, using many media _ pencil,
chalk, clay, rubber stamps, and so on. The aim is to expose children
to all ways of writing.
   ``We don't know from one child to the next which child learns
best by seeing, by hearing, by feeling, or by holding, and we want
to engage everything in the child,'' explains Martin.
   Children are not intimidated by the computer, and because the
program lets each one move ahead at his own speed, that child has no
fear of failure. ``The children know they are teaching themselves.''
   They learn to type even as they learn to recognize the letter
symbols. Martin says that by avoiding the labor of forming letters
by hand, children can concentrate on what they want to say.
   He estimates that kindergartners have vocabularies of around
1,000 words when they start school. ``To reduce them to a hundred
words in a primer is to ask them to go back to eating pablum.
   ``There are a half million words in English _ a magnificent
intellectual achievement. But when you mess it up with all the
peculiar spellings we use in English as a way of having children
learn _ to have them encode to write, then have them decode to read
_ you take the logic out of the system and you confuse things.''
   The children go straight to writing for meaning, spelling
phonemically. Later they easily learn accepted spellings.
   The program has been adapted for Spanish-speaking students _ Voy
a Leer Escribiendo, or VALE _ and for functionally illiterate adults
_ Principle of Alphabet Literacy, or PALS.
   Martin, former chairman of the National Panel on High School and
Adolescent Education of the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare and the U.S. Office of Education, developed the program on a
personal computer while recovering from a heart attack in l973. IBM
agreed to produce and market the program, with Martin's stipulation
to run field tests first, under direction of the Education Testing
Service of Princeton, N.J.
   The ETS evaluation, covering 10,000 students in 21 school
districts in the first year and samples of students in the second
year, showed that the computer-assisted children on average learned
faster and excelled at writing performance. Teachers interviewed in
the study said that these students spent more time writing
creatively and less time on phonic and structural analysis.
   The Mississippi program is the most ambitious, but another
large-scale use is in the New York City schools, which has set up
100 Writing to Read laboratories. It also has been used to teach
English overseas.
   ``Mississippi will be the first state in the country, to our
knowledge, to have such an extensive computer literacy system for
its children,'' said Gov. Ray Mabus as he and his wife, Julie,
announced the program last spring. ``Every child should, when this
program is in place, leave the first grade knowing how to read and
write.''
   About 400,000 adults in Mississippi _ out of a population of 2.3
million _ are estimated to be functionally illiterate.
   The state has received grants from the Riordan Foundation of Los
Angeles and the Ford Foundation of New York to help finance the
program.

   Couch potatoes in the classroom?
   It's a likely scenario this fall as more and more cable networks
tout educational offerings specifically designed as teaching aids.
   The competition took off in controversy with the debut of Channel
One, a flashy 12-minute newscast with two commercials. Cable News
Network soon weighed in with a news program minus the ads, followed
by the Discovery Channel with a five-day-a-week documentary package
available for taping.
   And that doesn't include other school-oriented programs from
C-SPAN, The Learning Channel and the Arts and Entertainment network.
   The offerings range from live public events and congressional
coverage on C-SPAN to nature films and historical documentaries on
Discovery. The Learning Channel featured vintage films like ``Oliver
Twist'' and ``A Farewell to Arms'' on a program designed to
encourage reading of the classics.
   And then there are the rival news programs from CNN and Whittle
Communications, producer of Channel One.
   Whittle conducted a $5 million, seven-week test run in six
schools last spring, with candy bars, shampoo and jeans among the
products advertised. Company officials are determining whether to
launch the program in 8,000 schools in 1990 _ a $100 million project.
   The trial run drew fire for a number of reasons. Educators
objected to inflicting ads on a captive audience. They also
complained that the program, heavy on graphics and hip teen-age
anchors, was superficial.
   ``Channel One is social studies by 90-second sound bites,''
charged Scott Thomson, executive director of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals. Furthermore, he said,
the program ``allows special interests to reach kids through
television commercials which they are forced to watch.''
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications, says the
ads are necessary to finance the $50,000 in satellite dishes, TVs
and VCRs given to schools that promise to show his program daily.
   ``Were this a perfect world, we would agree that the government,
not commercials, should provide this technology and programming,''
Whittle wrote in a New York Times op-ed piece. ``But in today's real
world of $20 textbook budgets and tough fiscal constraints, two
minutes of appropriate advertising is not a bad solution.''
   Whittle suffered a blow in May when the California department of
education said the state could not be billed for education funds for
time students spent watching commercials in class. ``Such time will
be deleted from the certification,'' the department said in a legal
opinion.
   The department also said that ``the imposition of forced
commercial advertising'' on schoolchildren may violate the state
constitution.
   Educators and TV watchdogs are reacting more favorably to the
daily ``CNN Newsroom,'' due to start Aug. 14 in time for the fall
school term _ a full year before Channel One would be available in
classrooms across the country.
   They note that CNN is a legitimate news operation, the 15-minute
program would feature adult anchors, and use of it in the classroom
would be voluntary and at the teacher's discretion. Perhaps most
important of all, CNN founder Ted Turner decided at the last minute
to ditch the commercials initially planned for the package.
   Turner says ``CNN Newsroom'' will cost millions of dollars but
CNN is profitable enough to absorb the expense. Whittle's venture
would be a money-maker, while Discovery _ with its daily, hour-long
``Assignment: Discovery'' _ expects to break even by enlisting
corporate and foundation underwriters.
   The Discovery underwriters will be identified onscreen, but their
names will never interrupt either of the two educational segments
planned for each hour. Thus students will never have to see the
sponsorship billboards.
   The education community has reserved its highest praise for the
Discovery series, which starts Sept. 18. For one thing, it is
divided into systematic, teacher-friendly curriculum blocks. Social
studies teachers, for example, will know that documentaries in their
field are shown on Tuesdays.
   Furthermore, the network is getting educational rights to each
program so teachers can tape segments at their convenience and use
them if and when they want. Teachers consequently remain in control
of what happens in their classrooms, rather than being forced to
show a daily program _ such as Channel One _ that may or may not be
the best use of time that day.
   ``If there are ways to provide this technology when, where and
how the teacher feels it best enhances instruction, discussion and
comprehension, then it is to be applauded,'' said Manya Ungar,
president of the National PTA. ``If it doesn't, it's a detriment.''

   With an investment of four years and probably more than $50,000,
choosing the right college is far from a trivial decision.
   Alice Ilchman, president of Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville,
N.Y., has this advice for parents and aspiring collegians:
   _ Sit in on a class or two. Are the students involved? Are you?
Is there opportunity to participate?
   _ Speak with the faculty. Look for faculty office hours or ask
the admissions office to make an appointment for you. Ask why they
chose to teach at this college and what they find rewarding about it.
   _ Wander around the campus. Are the buildings well-maintained?
Are they open and available to students? What is on the notice
boards?
   _ Check out the bookstore. Does it emphasize books, or just
sweatshirts and beer mugs?
   _ Look at the library. Are students using it? Are they awake?
   _ Learn about the students. What are they talking and thinking
about? Do they like being there? What percentage of students
graduate?
   _ Talk with your child. Listen to his view of himself and how he
thinks a particular college will let or help him develop.
   ``One thing I've learned as a parent and educator is that our
children probably know more than we think they do,'' says Miss
Ilchman. ``Guide, discuss, question, but trust the final judgment of
that budding student.''

   It's possible to get an Ivy League education without Ivy League
costs.
   Good public colleges with private school ambience and advantages
can be found, according to education experts.
   ``There are a number of small public institutions that are
rapidly reaching the standards of the `little' private Ivys,'' says
Richard Moll, who has served in admissions administration at Harvard
and Yale Universities and has written a book, ``The Public Ivys.''
   These small public colleges usually have high quality students
and faculty, small classes, rigorous curriculum, an intellectual
atmosphere and personal attention to students. Campus population
averages about 3,000, which works out to about 22 students in each
class.
   Moll says tuition costs at these colleges range between $850 and
$1,500 per year for in-state students, $2,500 to $4,000 for
out-of-staters. Room and board typically come to about $3,000. This
contrasts with private school tuition and fees which averaged
$12,526 in l988-89.
   Nearly two thirds of public college students receive financial
aid, averaging $2,800 a year, while the same proportion at private
schools receives an average of $6,000.
   Some of the schools mentioned by Moll and another author, Martin
Nemko, include Evergreen State College at Olympia, Wash.; St. Mary's
College of St. Mary's City, Md.; the University of North Carolina at
Asheville; Northwest Missouri State University at Kirksville; Ramapo
College in Ramapo, N.J.; Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg,
Va.; the New College of the University of South Florida at Sarasota;
the State University of New York at Geneseo; and the University of
Minnesota at Morris.
   Nemko, a former New York City teacher who is now an education
consultant and author of ``How to Get an Ivy League Education at a
State University'' cites St. Mary's College in Maryland as a
``decent copy of an elite New England private liberal arts college
that will cost you $80,000 less than the original.''
   The University of North Carolina-Asheville was rated in a recent
survey by the Association of American Colleges as having one of the
strongest humanities core curriculums in the country.
   The National Governors Association has called Ramapo College a
good example of a school with a good international focus, with
cooperative education and internship programs with international
corporations in the United States and overseas.
   According to Joseph Olander, president of Evergreen State
College, institutions like his stress critical thinking,
communication and computation skills _ ``the three Cs of education
for the 21st century.''

   Environmental studies _ trendy in the early 1970s but dropped by
many colleges for lack of interest _ have moved back into the
academic mainstream.
   New interest may have been triggered by concerns about the
threats to the ozone layer and by incidents like the Valdez oil
spill, colleges say, but the more likely reason is that the field is
maturing.
   ``The typical environmental activist has been succeeded by the
student with purely academic analytical skills,'' says Ortwin Renn,
professor of environment, technology and society at Clark University
in Worcester, Mass. Students today focus more on integration of
technical and policy issues. ``They are not advocates but people who
understand science and the issues and can argue their cases
effectively.''
   The most serious work is being done among his graduate students,
many of them on sabbatical from environmental posts in agencies or
private firms, returning to school for advanced scientific study.
   ``There is renewed interest in environmental issues, though it
seems to be coming from our international studies students rather
than our biology majors,'' says Steve Anderson, professor of biology
and the University of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif. ``Students are
taking a more global view of the world situation, recognizing that
the world's political and economic issues have definite
environmental components.''
   Bowdoin College, Antioch University, and Hood College are among
colleges reporting increased enrollments for environmental studies.
   Bowdoin, at Brunswick, Me., says the number of environmental
studies majors has quadrupled in the last three years. ``Some of our
most dedicated students come from areas of major pollution. For
example, we have several eager students from Chesapeake Bay,'' says
Edward Laine, director of its environmental studies program.
   Mitchell Thomashaw, co-chair of Antioch's environmental studies
at its New England Graduate School in Keene, N.H., also reports a
dramatic increase in enrollment for its program, which he says
emphasizes leadership, management theory and communications skills.
   
   At Hood, in Frederick, Md., interest in environmental studies has
remained constant in recent years, but entry-level course enrollment
has tripled recently. John Commito, professor of biology and
director of environmental studies, attributes the rise to current
issues in the news. Commito says that students at a woman's college
like Hood often take the introductory courses but won't major in the
subject because they feel they were poorly prepared in mathematics
and science during high school.
   Some institutions are building their course studies around local
issues. Students at St. Mary's College in St. Mary's City, Md., are
researching habitats on the river by their school, part of the
Chesapeake Bay system. Two seniors are conducting a study on a
disease which is killing oysters in the river. And at Whitman
College in Walla Walla, Wash., environmental students are working on
recycling facilities for all campus residence houses.
   The ``second generation'' of environmental management, as Clark's
Renn calls it, signals a new credibilty for the field. ``It
signifies that environment is part of normal policy, not just
reaction to the news.''

   ``If only I knew then what I know now''
are among the sadder words of school graduates.
   But a group of upperclass University of Rochester students tried
to ease that predicament for prospective freshmen recently by
sharing with them what they had learned about the social and
academic side of campus life.
   One of the tips from the students involved organizing their time,
making and keeping a schedule.
   ``Be prepared that it may take a while to learn what you can and
can't fit in,'' said Patricia Singleton, 21, a junior from Walnut
Ridge, Ark.
   ``And don't panic. You'll find a way of balancing your
activities, but it does take time, effort and willpower.''
   Some found that having outside jobs while at school actually
helped them in scheduling study time.
   ``Because I was busy working and participating in extracurricular
groups, I had to allocate my time for each activity _ working,
studying, relaxing. If you have a lot of free time, it's actually
easier to `blow off' studying,'' said Caroline Chung, 20, a
sophomore from DeKalb, Ill.
   The students agreed that getting involved in extracurricular
activities right away was a good idea.
   ``Join the undergraduate organization affiliated with the
department, go on any trips, or just attend lectures, dinners, and
receptions where faculty are present,'' said senior Tracy Coskie,
22, of Pittsford, N.Y. ``You'll get more out of your education if
you get to know faculty out of the classroom.''
   Some other tips:
   _ On money: ``One of the things I learned is that when I go
shopping, I have to leave my checkbook behind.''
   _ On roommates: ``Bring up problems you have with your roommate's
behavior immediately. If you do it in a calm manner, it probably
won't be a big deal. But if you wait until you're furious about
something that's been going on for two months, then things may get
out of hand.''
   _ On the ``freshman slump'': ``Everybody feels that way freshman
year, when so much is new and different. Don't put pressure on
yourself to do everything perfectly. Give yourself room to adjust to
the differences of college life. Just relax, do your best, and have
fun.''

   Some teen-age achievers say motivation
and care are needed to help their less brilliant classmates learn
more and prepare for life.
   Class size and individual attention are seen as important, and
the teens think that while more money for schools is needed, it's
not as important as the other factors.
   These attitudes were revealed by a poll of students listed in
``Who's Who Among American High School Students'' organized by its
publishers.
   ``A lot of students in my school aren't motivated to learn,''
reports Matt Henry of Florissant, Mo., one of the students. Henry
says motivating students is a shared responsibility of students,
teachers and parents. ``It's up to students to make an effort, but
it's also up to teachers to present material in a way that's
interesting and relevant to today's world.''
   Colleen Boyle of Twinsburg, Ohio, also thinks parental
involvement is important. ``My parents have always shown a lot of
interest in my academic progress as well as my extracurricular
activities, and it's been a big boost in helping me go forward. Some
students aren't so lucky.''
   Large class size got poor marks from the students. ``In a large
school like mine, many students seem to graduate without the basic
knowledge needed to succeed,'' says Lindsey Taucher of Plano, Texas.
Adds Claudine Cangiano from Plandome, N.Y.: ``In a large high school
environment like mine, a student may feel like a number.''
   She also thinks schools rely too much on computers. ``They can
enhance the learning process, but they cannot replace teachers.
Individual attention is still important.''
   Todd DiSimone from Lockport, Ill., says that money spent on
higher teacher salaries will draw more and better candidates. ``Then
the overall quality of teaching might be higher.''
   But Ms. Cangiano disagrees, saying she thinks more money won't
make that much difference. ``Good teachers are those who love what
they do and will give it their all, regardless of how much they are
paid.''

<TEXT>
   If the first concern of going to college is high tuition cost,
then the next is financing it, especially if your income is too high
to qualify for federally supported loans.
   Supplemental loans _ privately financed, often with institutional
connections _ often can fill the gap and are available when other
sources are not.
   ``In the case of parents who have more than one child going to
college, it's often difficult to pull together the necessary funds
from savings or monthly income to cover tuition payments,'' says
Diane L. Saunders, spokesperson for the non-profit New England
Education Loan Marketing Corporation, or Nellie Mae. ``This is where
supplemental loan programs can help greatly.''
   Similar to business and personal loans, supplementals are based
on credit, not need. Sponsors include state agencies, nonprofit
corporations, lending organizations, and colleges and universities,
either individually or through cooperative consortiums. Financing is
through bond issues or other private sources.
   Higher loan limits and longer repayment schedules than federal
loans characterize most of them. Interest rates are higher than the
federal loans but still lower than personal or consumer loans. Many
offer options to pay interest only during the student's enrollment,
deferring the principal.
   Some of the supplementals can be found only in particular areas,
though others offer help nationally and can be used at any
accredited college or university.
   Public libraries, boards or departments of education, guidance
counselors and the universities themselves can help you locate a
supplemental loan program. ``One of the best sources is the college
or university at which the student has been accepted,'' says Ms.
Saunders.
   She adds that Nellie Mae offers supplemental loan programs for
both undergraduate and postgraduate students called Excel and Share.

   A potential school dropout exhibits early warning signals that
can help his parents head off the problem.
   Unfortunately, many parents miss the signals and find themselves
surprised when the adolescent decides to drop out of school without
a diploma, says Glenn Hogen, vice president of Sylvan Learning
Corporation, a supplemental learning service.
   ``Children exhibit symptoms, even as early as first or second
grade, that signal trouble ahead and indicate the potential for a
dropout situation,'' he says.
   He advises parents to be alert to these warning signals and
intervene early with help from teachers, lay or religious
counselors, or medical authorities. ``Counselors can act as
intermediaries between parent and child and can accurately analyze
the extent of the problem,'' says Hogen.
   Some of signs he cites:
   A new pattern of dropping grades after a record of good grades.
   Teacher comments like ``not working up to potential,'' or ``does
not pay attention in class.'' The comment, ``is well-mannered in the
classroom,'' may be a euphemism for disinterest.
   Failure to complete homework.
   Lack of interest in sports or classroom activities.
   Behavioral problems such as fighting with other students or other
attempts to provoke expulsion.
   Negative comments about teachers.
   Blaming others.
   Becoming either passive or noisy.
   Hogen says the problem often develops after the student has
missed learning and finds he can't overcome the gap. As he falls
further behind, he gives up in frustration and anger.
   Positive things parents can do include reading and discussing
report cards in a non-judgmental way with the child; praising his
successes; communicating with teachers; asking the child for his
feelings and opinions and how he thinks he can improve; encouraging
him to develop realistic but challenging goals to improve study
habits; providing guidance and ground rules; and discussing _ not
grilling him _ about his progress and school activities weekly.
   ``Active listening is crucial. That means going beneath the words
to the meanings and emotions, or what children are not saying,''
Hogen says.

<TEXT>
   The idea of summer vacation for children
should be re-examined, with summer activities _ whether school, a
job or camp _ arranged to fit the individual child, says a Los
Angeles psychologist.
   A whole summer of inactivity breaks the study chain, says Dr.
Robert R. Butterworth, a specialist in youth psychology. An
integrated program of work, study and leisure can be designed so
that what the child learns in the longer term doesn't get lost in a
summer dropoff.
   ``I'm not saying that kids shouldn't have a vacation. But for two
months and two weeks?''
   The problem is that many parents can't cope with deciding what
kind of plans to make for their children, he says. And the choices
they make often backfire, he adds.
   ``They don't know how to approach it directly. It's an emotional
situation,'' he says.
   For one thing, he says, there's no evidence that summer jobs will
help underachievers or problem children. The discretionary income
often distorts teens' focus, and often that income goes for drugs.
``Summer jobs won't turn them around.''
   And high achievers, the ones who usually go to summer school,
really don't need it, he says. ``Often the achievers need a break.''
   Good students need little or no supervision but need to be
encouraged to find a creative, change-of-pace summer activity,
including volunteer work.
   Average achievers also may benefit from volunteering, attending
academic camp, reading, or learning a new academic skill. The low
achiever _ usually a child who simply doesn't work up to his
capabilities _ should be steered to summer school and encouraged to
develop good study and work habits.
   Low achievers who also have drug, alcohol, or behavioral problems
need a very structured summer job or school program, according to
Butterworth. They need strict curfews, high supervision and perhaps
group treatment for their problems. ``For this group, too much free
time can be dangerous and can lead to trouble.''
   Unfortunately, youngsters who need the most help are the ones
least likely to get it, he says.

   Moderation in all things, including your kid's school lunch.
   Yes, be concerned about nutrition, but don't worry too much if he
pigs out occasionally.
   Obviously, you can exercise greater control over what he eats if
he's a brown bagger, but accept that his social needs are going to
take him now and then to fast food establishments whose menus
include high-fat items like hamburgers and thick milkshakes.
   There's no firm agreement among pediatricians and other health
care professionals about how much fat is too much, though they do
agree that children need fat for growth. About 30 to 40 percent of a
child's calories should come from fat, recommends the American
Academy of Pediatrics. That's close to the 34-39 percent spread
shown in a federal survey of the current diets of American children.
   ``I think run-of-the-mill parents should be aware that a high-fat
diet is not good,'' advises the academy's nutrition committee
chairman, Dr. Laurence Finberg. ``You don't need to say it any more
stringently than that.''
   Cholesterol levels in children now average about 160 milligrams
per deciliter of blood. Many doctors think a child would benefit
from a lower average; the target would be a level of 200 or lower by
the time the child reaches adulthood. ``We believe that the ideal
level of cholesterol in the blood would be between 110 and 140 for
children,'' says Dr. Curtis Ellison , a cardiologist at Boston
University Medical School.
   ``It's normal for kids to go through periods in which they eat
the same foods day in and day out,'' says David Mintz, whose
company, Tofutti Brands Inc., makes cholesterol-free foods. ``It
reflects emerging independent behavior and developing tastebuds.''
   He suggests offsetting these temporary ``food jags'' by making
sure that a variety of grains, fruits, vegetables, and protein foods
_ meats, poultry, fish and legumes _ are available at home meals.
And using the leftovers will enable parents to vary the contents of
the lunch bag.
   He also suggests preparing low-fat meals prepared at home on days
when the child has pizza at the school cafeteria or hamburgers at
the neighborhood hangout. And providing nutritional snack food to
substitute for the high-calorie, high-fat versions will encourage
children to eat sensibly. Some examples he cites include yogurt with
fresh fruit or cholesterol-free frozen desserts for sweets;
pretzels, popcorn or dry unsweetened cereal for munching; and
unsweetened fruit juices for beverages.

   In the belief that writing is the key to all
learning, the Crestview Elementary School teaches writing as its
main course from kindergarten to the fifth grade.
   Crestview students prefer writing to toys, says one of the
kindergarten teachers at this public magnet school. ``You give them
word games and a chance to write, and they get really into it.''
   The school calls itself the Center for Learning Through Writing,
and the principal, Jill Witlin, says that the intensified writing
program helps the students move ahead quickly. ``By writing,
children learn more and become more literate.''
   All subjects are taught within the context of writing. Children
are introduced to vocabulary relevant to the subject and encouraged
to form sentences with these words. Spelling and grammar are
fine-tuned later.
   ``When you know how to write, you get to learn all the other
aspects of literacy,'' says Dr. Evelyn Rothstein, who with Dr. Diane
Gess created the Write Track program the school uses.
   Based in Nyack, N.Y., both these experienced educators visit
schools with the Write Track system, training teachers how to use
it. They also provide complementary classroom materials.
   Programs are in place in schools especially committed to
improving literacy skills _ such as public schools in Clovis, N.M.,
Moss Point, Miss., and New York City. Crestview is unusual in that
it uses the program as the key part of its magnet school approach.

   America's widespread math illiteracy might be less of a problem
if parents became more involved in their children's math education,
according to a Chicago learning authority.
   ``Many theories have been propounded on why U.S. youngsters
appear to have problems coping with math,'' says Robert Baseman,
president of the American Learning Corp., a division of
Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.
   ``What it comes down to, however, is the need for parents to be
more directly involved in their children's math training. We think
there is reason for optimism if youth and parents work together.''
   Baseman's optimism is based on observations in other countries
where parents frequently become deeply involved in their children's
math education.
   In these situations, he explains, if a child faces problems his
parents are then in a better position to detect the whys and
wherefores needed to solve the problems.
   The shortcomings of U.S. mathematics standards have been
underscored in recent reports finding American students being
outperformed by their counterparts in four other countries _ South
Korea, Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom _ and four Canadian
provinces.
   One way to apply parent power to the math illiteracy problem is
to incorporate a sense of fun into the process, says Baseman.
   When you take a child shopping, he suggests, let him help weigh
produce, count change and price the best buy.
   If a child has missed school, try to learn what math concepts
were taught when he or she was absent, Baseman adds, because failure
to learn a concept when it is taught can hamper future performance.
   Baseman also suggests:
   _ When planning a long-distance vacation or other trip by car,
have your child use road maps to determine the number of miles to
your destination.
   _ When baking or cooking, have your child help by reading
directions on packages and measuring incredients into bowls. Let
them become familiar with measuring spoons and cups.
   _ Have your child log how his or her allowance money is spent
during a particular period _ say, vacation time or over the summer
months. Based on money received, and money spent, your child should
be able to determine the percentage of money saved.

   Children can't be crime-proofed, but they can reduce the
possibility of being victimized with these tips from the National
Crime Prevention Council, recently published in the McGruffLetter:
   On the way to and from school, walk near the curb and against
traffic. Try to walk or play with friends. Tell your parents if
you're going to be late coming home. Know where the nearest block
parent is on your route. Stay alert to what's going on around you.
Look out for other kids' safety and report anything you see that
doesn't seem right.
   At school, stay away from strangers who hang around restrooms or
playgrounds. Don't leave school with anyone without permission from
a parent. If somebody does something that makes you feel unsafe,
remember you can say no or run away; tell an adult you trust about
it. Keep your school safe by not damaging or destroying property,
and don't let others do it, either.
   The McGruffLetter, a new publication, includes safety and crime
prevention advice for people of all ages and includes a ``kidwatch''
insert. Distribution is through house publications of companies,
which can obtain preprints at near-cost. It's produced by a New York
firm, Essential Services Production, under license from the NCPC in
Washington.

   More public school funding does not necessarily mean improved
student performance, says a University of Rochester (N.Y.) economist.
   ``There is little if any relationship between differences in
spending and the quality of schooling,'' says Professor Eric
Hanushek in a recent issue of Educational Researcher magazine.
   ``It's tempting to believe that the amount of money spent on
education will determine how well students will perform,'' he says.
``The logic is compelling: We figure that with more money, we can
attract better teachers, create superior programs, and reduce
classroom overcrowding so that students can get more individualized
instruction.
   ``Unfortunately, this strategy by itself has not led to
significant improvements in students' achievements.''
   Family background, he says, has a major influence on students, as
does the skill of their teachers.
   ``There is no substitute for good teachers,'' he says, but
``differences in teacher skill are not strongly related to
educational backgrounds, amount of teaching experience, or teaching
in small classes.''
   Hanushek says schools should direct their attention to the actual
performance of teachers through such incentives as merit pay.
   Hanushek, former deputy director of the Congressional Budget
Office, analyzed 187 separate studies of students' performance at
primary and secondary schools during the past 20 years.

   Don't stress your child by arranging too many after-school
activities, advises a child psychiatrist.
   ``Time to play and to relax is important. Without constant
pressure to succeed, eventually a child may even hook into genuine
interests,'' says Dr. Richard Oberfield, clinical associate
professor of psychiatry at New York University Medical Center.
   Parents should ask themselves if they are providing lessons and
activities for themselves instead of the child, he advises. ``If you
always wanted to play three musical instruments, but couldn't, don't
force that dream on your children. It's one thing to introduce them
to opportunities to learn and quite another to make them mandatory.''
   It's important for parents to spend unstructured time with their
children, he adds. ``This gives them the feeling of being cared
about for themselves, not just for their performance, which is
integral to their self-esteem.''

   Elementary school children in Cincinnati, Chicago, Atlanta,
Dallas and Kansas City will be learning some basics about weather
reporting and forecasting when tags are returned from finders of a
series of balloons they released in May.
   The science project, the Lucky Charms Red Balloon School Science
Project, is sponsored by the manufacturer of Lucky Charms cereal,
who recruited meteorologist Jon Lehuta to talk to children at each
launch site in May. Children were able to view the balloons in
flight with a theodolite telescope. Tags returned from finders of
the balloons will tell how far the balloons traveled and who found
them.
   Lehuta says that the project will help children learn basic
weather skills. ``They also can learn how to ask meaningful
questions, collect data accurately, organize information, use
observations to answer questions _ and have fun doing it.''

   Thirty students will tackle this issue, under the leadership of
Johan Galtung, during an eight-month tour to meet experts in foreign
countries, including the Soviet Union, Germany, Israel, Egypt,
India, Thailand and Japan. In the process, they will earn 36 credits
from Bard College, with which IHP is affiliated.
   Joan Tiffany, director of IHP, says research and study areas also
include human needs; human rights and the environment; culture,
peace and war; theories of peace; theories of conflict; and
Ghandism. The IHP is in its 35th year and is open to students from

   You want your kid to love the world? Let him cuddle a soft,
stuffed world globe called Hugg-a-Planet Earth.
   The basic soft sculpture Earth measures 12 inches in diameter and
maps out political boundaries, continents, countries, oceans,
islands, states and provinces in bright primary colors.
   Robert Forenza, the manufacturer, says the idea is to encourage
people ``to develop a natural curiosity about the planet and to
appreciate its natural beauty.''
   Also in the product line are 6- and 24-inch versions, a
geographic version with natural physical features, globes featuring
constellations (one with the path of Halley's Comet), and the Peace
Bear, a white teddy bear with a baby planet. Soft-sculptured Mars
and United States maps will be added this year.

   Youngsters will be going back to school this year decked out with
showy clothes and accessories, the funkier the better, say fashion
experts. Some of the gear will recall ancient times _ the 1950s and
1960s.
   And yes, the once-ubiquitous smile face is back.
   Bright colors, including neons, will accent everything. Costumes
will include oversized tops and pants, slouch socks pushed low over
skips, oversized belts, exotic hair ornaments, and colorful plastic
jewelry.
   Bobby socks trimmed with Scotty dogs, Navajo designs and smile
faces will be in the stores, to wear with saddle shoes or
jewel-toned slipons for girls and hiking-boot style shoes for boys.
   Jewelry that doubles as cosmetics compacts and bottles is being
marketed as Fazz Zoo by Hasbro, the toy manufacturer. Designs
feature wild animal motifs in spots, stripes and other patterns. The
smile face appears again in a line of jewelry called ``String
Alongs'' from Brookside Enterprises.
   Backpacks and book bags are available in neon colors, too,
decorated with peace symbols and smile faces. One line called Bow
Biters features cartoon characters like Garfield and Snoopy and
television's Muppets.
   ``There are many more accessories out there that allow kids to
express their personalities,'' says Sara Feldman, fashion editor of
Young Fashions magazine.

   What a teacher wears in the classroom affects the response of her
students, but the result may not be as expected.
   A Miami University study shows that most students prefer a
teacher who wears jeans over the one who wears a suit.
   ``You might anticipate that a female teacher in a suit would get
the most respect, but my research doesn't show that,'' says Dr. Sara
Butler, associate professor of home economics and consumer sciences
at Miami's Oxford, Ohio, campus. Butler and a graduate student,
Kathy Roesel, surveyed 201 students at two northern Kentucky high
schools to find out how female teachers' clothes affect them. There
were 157 girls and 44 boys in the study.
   ``The teacher in jeans was generally viewed as fun, approachable,
not especially knowledgeable, not looking like a teacher and
generally preferable,'' says Butler. Curiously, that teacher was
seen as least fair when it came to grades.
   ``In contrast, the suited teacher was seen as possessing the
image of a teacher but was the teacher students preferred not to
have. This teacher was seen as unapproachable, not especially fun
and an authority figure who assigns homework.''

   Antonio Cipollone, his name out of the
newspapers and into the lawbooks, has gone back to a quiet retiree
life, strolling on the boardwalk, visiting relatives and traveling a
bit.
   One trip brought the 65-year-old Italian immigrant to the United
Nations May 31, where the World Health Organization awarded him a
medal for his landmark legal fight.
   A year ago Tuesday, six federal court jurors here awarded him
$400,000 for the lung-cancer death of his wife Rose, the nation's
first damages judgment in a smoker-death case. The verdict is being
appealed.
   ``I don't know if I could do it again,'' said Cipollone, of
Lakehurst, N.J. ``I was really tired, let's face it. It was every
day, every day. It was really rough for a while.''
   For 4{ months, all eyes in the $22 billion tobacco industry and
anti-smoking forces were focused on Cipollone's court case against
Liggett Group Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. The
companies made the cigarettes smoked by Mrs. Cipollone for 40 years
before she died at the age of 58 five years ago.
   Jurors found that Liggett had violated an express warranty, or
advertising promise that its products were safe. All three companies
were absolved of conspiring to defraud the public about the health
dangers of smoking.
   But the industry's 30-year invincibility had been violated, and
tobacco opponents were encouraged that a new surge of lawsuits might
be launched.
   It has not happened.
   From a peak of 150 in 1987, the number of pending suits against
the industry has dropped to around 80, cigarette companies and
tobacco analysts say.
   ``In a sense, they're quiet times,'' said Richard Daynard, a
Northeastern University law professor who heads the Tobacco Products
Liability Project, which supports lawyers suing the cigarette
industry.
   ``I think people are waiting for additional developments _
plaintiffs' attorneys _ before they make their investments in these
cases,'' he said.
   The industry and some Wall Street analysts see the anti-smoking
litigants in retreat.
   ``The proof is in the pudding,'' said Kurt A. Feuerman, an
analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ``The number of cases is much
lower.''
   He points to other numbers: the continued flood of profits to the
cigarette makers and the health of their stock.
   The day after the verdict, tobacco stocks retreated but have
since come back mightily. Philip Morris' post-verdict price of about
$83, for example, is now around $140.
   The industry also argued that the relatively small award
discouraged other would-be anti-tobacco lawyers from suing in light
of the years of work and millions of dollars needed to battle the
industry.
   ``It was an absolute masterpiece of spin control on their part,
to take a defeat and turn it into if not a victory, at least a
non-defeat,'' countered Daynard.
   Cipollone's lead attorney, Marc Z. Edell, acknowledged some
attorneys may have been discouraged.
   ``I think the momentum of the cases has stopped, basically, and
the easy pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that a lot of lawyers
anticipated would rise out of these cases just isn't there.''
   What's needed is expertise in developing such cases and practice
in trying them, he said. There's also the question of whether the
Cipollone verdict will stand up on appeal.
   ``We don't want to undertake the financial commitment as well as
the professional commitment to represent people when we don't know
what the future will bring,'' said Edell, who has five cigarette
cases on hold in New Jersey.
   A federal appeals court is considering Liggett's challenge to the
express warranty verdict. The state Supreme Court also is
considering Edell's challenge of a 1987 New Jersey law excusing
cigarettes from the risk-utility theory of liability _ that is,
whether a product's risk outweighs its usefulness.
   This fall should bring a flurry of activity. Three cases are set
for trial then in Beaumont, Texas; Boston; and Lexington, Miss.
   Daynard still believes that some day the Cipollone case will
prove a watershed in tobacco litigation.
   He reports receiving requests for 150 sets of documents
introduced at the Cipollone trial. The case was considered unique
for the large quantity of damaging corporate memos and reports
introduced at trial.
   Anti-tobacco litigants say their availability sharply reduces the
enormous costs of waging a legal war against cigarette makers.
   Edell, who has made about 20 lecture appearances since the trial,
said the case also led to a ``tremendous volume of inquiries'' from
other would-be plaintiffs, though he has taken no new cases.
   ``We don't want to undertake the financial commitment as well as
the professional commitment to represent people when we don't know
what the future will bring,'' he said, referring to the pending
appeal of the Cipollone verdict. He has five cigarette cases on hold
in New Jersey.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering Liggett's
challenge to the express warranty verdict. The state Supreme Court
also is considering Edell's challenge of a 1987 New Jersey law
excusing cigarettes from the risk-utility theory of liability _ that
is, whether a product's risk outweighs its usefulness.
   Recent state court decisions favor both sides. The California
Supreme Court last month upheld a 1987 state law barring liability
suits over ``inherently unsafe'' products, including cigarettes.
   A month earlier, the Minnesota Supreme Court found that warning
labels on cigarette packs starting in 1966 do not give tobacco
companies complete immunity from lawsuits, as other courts have held.

   Switzerland has become the latest
European country to ban all imports of ivory.
   The Swiss measure, which takes effect Tuesday, closes freeport
warehouses to ivory shipments and forbids re-export from
Switzerland, an economics ministry announcement said.
   Environment ministers of the 12-nation European Community last
Friday called on all members to bar ivory imports, a response to
growing concern about the rapid decimation of African elephant
herds, much of it by poachers.
   France, West Germany and Denmark had banned ivory imports earlier.
   Switzerland, which is not an EC member but borders on three,
bought less than 0.1 percent of African raw ivory exports totaling
115 tons last year, according to official statistics.

<TEXT>
   Often derided as ``a nice place to live, but you
wouldn't want to visit,'' Atlanta tries one more time this week to
amuse conventioneers and capture its soul as Underground Atlanta
opens for business _ again.
   Seven years after the lights went out, ostensibly for good, the
entertainment and shopping playground beneath downtown is set to
open Thursday after a three-year overhaul under the auspices of The
Rouse Co., the wizards of American urban reclamation.
   In its prime, Underground Atlanta was Atlanta's answer to the
French Quarter, created in old storefronts that were the city's
heart before a network of bridges over railroad tracks literally
raised downtown one level.
   Underground had swinging Dixieland, loud rock 'n' roll, cool
jazz, fine eateries, chic watering holes _ even a shop where
segregationist restaurateur-turned-governor Lester Maddox signed
autographs and sold souvenirs.
   Underground opened in 1969, peaked in 1972, was struggling by
1975, and was gone by 1982. It was eulogized as the victim of crime
_ or a perception thereof _ derelicts, subway construction, ripoff
merchants and changing times. There were dozens of theories about
what went wrong, but seemingly no answers.
   Without it, downtown Atlanta has acquired the reputation of a
ghost town after dark, which has been an albatross around the neck
of the city's thriving convention industry. While conventioneers sit
in gleaming downtown hotels, real Atlantans are miles away in the
biracial city's largely white suburbs.
   In 1985, the city signed the deal for a $142 million
rerevitalization. It turned to Rouse, the people responsible for
Boston's Faneuil Hall Market Place, Baltimore's Harborplace, New
York's South Street Seaport, among other projects.
   ``We're trying to create a town center for metropolitan Atlanta,
back to the birthplace of Atlanta,'' said Joseph G. Martin Jr.,
president of the Underground Atlanta development company. ``We want
it to be a place ... where visitors will come to find out about what
Atlanta has to offer, but where also the hometown crowd can feel
some sense of identity.''
   Mayor Andrew Young sees the new Underground as ``one of the most
significant accomplishments'' of two terms in office. ``This
represents a new heart for Atlanta. It represents a gathering place
for the entire metro area.''
   The new Underground is on and around the original site, on
downtown's south side, just blocks from the high-rise hotel
district. It's three times the size of the old Underground; visitors
will find 22 restaurants and nightclubs and nearly 100 retailers.
While the emphasis on retailing marks a change for Underground, the
entertainment focus is something new for Rouse.
   ``We've never done this strong an entertainment aspect to any of
our urban places,'' said William M. Coleman, vice president and
general manager of Rouse-Atlanta, the Rouse affiliate created to run
the project.
   ``Some of that is due to the name,'' he said. ``Underground
Atlanta has probably the highest name recognition of any project
we've ever touched ... and what Underground Atlanta was known for
was entertainment.''
   Rouse officials anticipate 10 million to 11 million visitors a
year, half of them out-of-towners. They say there are enough office
workers and convention-goers downtown to meet three-fourths of
Underground's needs.
   Even so, Martin said, ``The real test of whether the project
succeeds ... is whether the project appeals to residents. The
obvious concern _ what a lot of people talk about around here _ is
security.''
   That's because the old Underground came to be regarded as
dangerous.
   Dante Stephensen, whose Dante's Down The Hatch jazz club and
restaurant anchored the old Underground, said, ``At its worst,
Underground had a lower crime rate than Lenox Square (a popular
mall). But downtown areas can't protect themselves from bad
publicity.''
   Clearly, this time around Underground must be perceived as safe.
   ``We've taken a common-sense approach,'' Martin said. A squad of
some 30 private guards will patrol, accompanied by Atlanta police,
who are building a 34-officer substation there. Planners have made
sure there are no blind alleys, and lighting designers have made it
bright enough to read at midnight.
   Martin admits to being irked that he is repeatedly asked what
Underground will do to keep out ``undesirables.'' ``First, tell me
who the `undesirables' are. This is a town center. It's open to
everyone. If a person comes to Underground and happens to look
different, that's fine. If a person starts to infringe on somebody
else's rights, that's not fine.''
   A no-nonsense security policy seems to have wide public appeal.
Where city officials triggered a storm of criticism with a plan to
run vagrants out before last year's Democratic National Convention,
hardly anything has been heard from anyone concerned about
loiterers' civil rights in Underground.
   ``I don't see it as a problem,'' Coleman said. ``The biggest
problem is in perception, and that perception problem goes away as
people come here and have a good time and find out they aren't
hassled.''
   ``I would be surprised,'' Martin said, ``if Underground is not
the safest place in the whole Atlanta area.''
   It had better be. The city has sunk more than $80 million in
revenue bonds, as well as other public funding, into Underground. If
it flops, the city could be forced to cough up some $3 million a
year for 30 years.
   ``Underground is important symbolically, and it is a test of
whether a town center can work here, whether we have enough
cohesiveness,'' Martin said. ``Because if we continue to drift
apart, as we've been doing, there could be all sorts of consequences
_ economic, political, social and otherwise.''
   And although Rouse has relatively little capital invested, the
company's track record is on the line. ``It seems that each year,
the expectations get higher, as they see what's happened in other
cities,'' Coleman said.
   ``Rouse has taken slums and turned them into landmarks,'' said
Stephenson, who is reopening Dante's. ``And Underground Atlanta was
never as bad, at its worst, as any of those other areas were.''
   Project officials maintain there's virtually no way Underground
will fail.
   ``I'm convinced Underground is going to be a great success,''
Martin said, pointing out that while two developers put together the
first Underground on a shoestring, this time the city is landlord,
partner and major investor.
   ``The city leaders recognize how important it is, and they're not
going to let it fail,'' he said. ``They just can't.''

   The stock market started the week on a sluggish
note today, with shares under pressure from profit-taking.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 3.49 points
on Friday, shed another 9.88 points and stood at 2,503.54 at 10 a.m.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.34 million shares after the
first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by a wide margin, with 670 issues
down, 310 up and 463 unchanged.
   Wall Street analysts attributed today's weakness to continuing
interest by investors to collect profits made during the recent
advance powered by takeover activity. However, they said sentiment
still seems positive so no significant selloff is expected.

   Thousands of coal miners refused to show
up for work today across southern West Virginia, after the head of
the United Mine Workers told cheering supporters that ``it's time
for labor to rise up and fight back.''
   A rally Sunday drew 12,000 people outside the state Capitol to
call attention to UMW's 2-month-old strike against the Pittston Coal
Group. This morning, several other mining companies reported
walkouts.
   Gary White, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, an
industry group, estimated that a third of the state's 30,000 miners
stayed home today, most of them in the southern part of the state.
There was no evidence the walkouts affected operations in other
states.
   In his speech to the rally Sunday, UMW President Richard Trumka
had pledged to widen the UMW's strike against Pittston, but there
was no answer early this morning at the UMW's headquarters in
Washington, or at the home of union spokesman Joe Corcoran.
   ``It's time for labor to rise up and fight bak,'' Trumka told
protesters. ``The 1990s will see us resisting like we did in the
'60s, in the streets, in the hallways, in the corridors of power.''
   David Todd, a spokesman for Hobet Mining in Madison, said union
miners did not report for work beginning with the midnight shift.
The walkout at Hobet probably is related to the Pittston strike, he
said, because his company has no pending disputes with the union.
Hobet employs nearly 500 miners.
   ``We have no picketers and no direct communications,'' Todd said.
``Beyond that, they have given us no notice that this is a memorial
period.''
   Miners are allowed a 10-day ``memorial period'' to stop work and
air grievances under the 1988 Bituminous Coal Operators Agreement,
which covers Hobet and most other coal companies, but not Pittston.
   Among the mines reporting no workers this morning were Omar
Mining in Laurel Creek, where 100 miners are employed, and Kess
Coals in Whitesville, which reported 55 miners out.
   ``We're here available for work whenever the men come out,'' said
Troy Wills, a supervisor at Kess.
   About 1,600 Pittston miners in Virginia and West Virginia walked
off the job in April over wage, benefit and rule disputes after
working for more than a year without a contract.
   The strike has slowed Pittston's production in Virginia, and all
but halted Pittston mining in West Virginia.
   Miners blocking roads at Virginia picket sites have landed more
than 2,000 union members and supporters in jail, and resulted in
millions of dollars in court-ordered fines against the union, whose
strike fund and liquid assets are dwindling.
   The rally culminated a six-day march by miners through southern
West Virginia.
   Trumka had refused to elaborate Sunday on his threat to expand
the strike, but left open the possibility of taking the walkout to
other parts of the country, including Kentucky, where about 200
Pittston miners remain on the job.
   ``Our government stands up and fights for freedom in Poland and
China,'' said Trumka, who led supporters to the Capitol in the final
leg of the march.
   ``Where are the cries of protest when it's an American worker
having his or her rights trampled?''
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton made an unscheduled appearance
at the rally, urging a compromise solution to the strike.
   ``The question before us is not who will win, but how all can
win,'' said Caperton, who was endorsed by the United Mine Workers in
last year's election.
   The rally included appearances by leaders of striking Eastern
Airlines employees and more than a dozen other local and national
unions. The grounds of the Capitol were turned into a sea of
camouflage green, the color of the uniform adopted by strikers.

<TEXT>
   After three years of highly publicized
investigations, arrests, leaks, innuendo, trials and mistrials, the
government finally scored a courtroom victory in a securities fraud
case.
   The conviction Friday of corporate raider Paul A. Bilzerian,
whose bushy mustache and bargain basement suits belied his business
world clout, marked a number of firsts in a three-year federal
crackdown on Wall Street crime.
   It was the first guilty verdict delivered by a jury in a case
centering on criminal securities fraud charges.
   It was the first time stock ``parking,'' in which parties try to
conceal the sale or transfer of securities, was prosecuted as a
felony.
   It was the first time information spun off from the Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandal _ via Los Angeles stockbroker turned
government informant Boyd L. Jefferies _ yielded a conviction.
   ``We will continue to prosecute any case that's appropriate to
prosecute. and if that includes parking violations, then so be it,''
said U.S. Attorney Benito Romano.
   Wall Street lawyers said the swift conviction _ the Bilzerian
jury deliberated just eight hours _ should buoy the government in a
series of scheduled trials, including the racketeering and fraud
case against bond mogul Michael Milken.
   ``It does give them some momentum and embolden them to continue
other prosecutions,'' said a New York securities defense lawyer who
asked not to be identified.
   The government was stymied earlier this year with two mistrials
in its other top case at U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the stock
manipulation and wire fraud trial of GAF Corp. and a top executive.
A jury deliberated 12 days before the second mistrial was declared.
   ``The fact of the matter is it just shows that the GAF case was
an aberration and that it bodes ill for Milken and that ilk going
forward in the future,'' the securities attorney said.
   Defense lawyers believed the Bilzerian jury could have gotten
lost in a morass of details it couldn't grasp, which has long been a
fear of the government in prosecuting complex stock market-related
frauds.
   But courtroom observers said the government presented a strong
case _ and that Bilzerian, testifying in his own defense, failed to
exonerate himself by admitting he supplied misleading information to
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The 38-year-old Singer Co. chairman and corporate takeover
specialist was found guilty on nine counts of breaking securities
and tax laws and making false statements in connection with three
failed takeovers and one other transaction in 1985 and '86. He faces
up to 45 years in jail and $2.25 million in fines.
   The conviction on the stock parking charges broke new legal
ground, attorneys said. Parking, typically done to dodge tax or
disclosure laws, is not defined anywhere as a crime, but is lumped
with other actions that may be used to violate federal securities
laws.
   Many defense lawyers had argued that the government was
stretching the law by seeking to prosecute the activity criminally.
The jury's verdict proved them wrong.
   ``It certainly removes any illusion that parking is an inncocuous
activity,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a New York securities lawyer.
``It does underline that parking activities will be viewed very
seriously by federal regulators and they can make it stick.''
   Parking violations are included in the civil and criminal cases
against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the racketeering and fraud
indictments of Princeton-Newport Partners LP and Drexel financier
Milken.
   ``I still believe that despite the conviction it was not the kind
of case that should have been prosecuted criminally,'' securities
defense lawyer Stanley Arkin said. ``I certainly hope it's not a
precedent.''
   Finally, the conviction marked success in a case derived from the
snowballing information provided by Boesky, who paid $100 million to
settle insider trading charges in 1986 and named names.
   Boesky had told government prosecutors about Jefferies, whose
testimony was central to the GAF trial but was contradicted several
times. In the Bilzerian case, he was viewed as more credible.
Jefferies is to testify in the GAF retrial and another fraud case
later this year.
   The government's only other victory in a case tied to the Wall
Street scandals was the perjury conviction in March of Drexel
assistant bond trader Lisa Jones, who lied during the
Princeton-Newport inquest but wasn't charged with violating
securities laws.

   The stock market moved broadly lower today,
driven down by weakness in the dollar and government bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 18.83 points to
2,494.59 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.68 million shares after 90
minutes of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by a wide margin, with 884 issues
down, 378 up and 480 unchanged.
   Wall Street analysts attributed today's slump to a sharp decline
in the dollar, which was pushed down as big commercial banks sold to
collect profits amassed over the past weeks while the dollar soared
higher against major foreign currencies.
   The dollar's slide dampened buying enthusiasm in the credit
markets, where the 30-year Treasury bond pulled back a bit after
Friday's impressive rally in which the bellwhether bond surged
nearly 2 full points, or $20 for each $1,000 in bond value.
   Several stocks in takeover situations were among the most heavily
traded NYSE issues. Paramount Communications led the actives list,
down 2[ at 56} and Warner Communications was off 1\ to 54~.
   Among airline stocks, Pan Am fell [ to 4[. NWA, parent of
Northwest Air, was down } to 107}. Northwest's pilots union said it

   A top Chinese banker said Monday that
China wanted to continue with its recent economic reforms despite
the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.
   ``We want to push our economic reforms forward,'' Chen Yuan,
deputy governor of the Bank of China, said at a meeting of the Bank
of International Settlements.
   ``It is a very urgent task for us that we see the economic and
political situation stabilize.''
   Chen said it would take several months before the full economic
impact of the strife becomes known.
   However, he acknowledged that the the civil unrest in Beijing and
other major Chinese cities already has caused widespread work and
transportation disruptions, increased food prices and led to anxiety
among Western investors and creditors about the prospects for future
investment in the country.
   Chen repeated assurances already made by other Chinese officials
that the country intends to honor all its obligations to foreign
creditors.
   ``I think there is absolutely not a problem in this field. We are
confident. The Bank of China has a very good reputation (with
foreign creditors),'' he said.
   Chen said that the cost of servicing China's estimated $30
billion foreign debt amounted to about 11 percent of China's foreign
income.
   He said inflation remained China's biggest economic problem, and
he estimated that retail prices in the first quarter of this year
rose at an annual rate of more than 20 percent.

<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. today announced a restructuring of
its automotive parts unit, including the sale of its automotive
retail division and the acquisition of a Georgia brake manufacturing
plant.
   The transactions were designed to strengthen Tenneco's market
position in the automotive parts business and generate an estimated
$46 million in available cash, the company said in a statement.
   Under the plan, Tenneco Automotive agreed to sell its
Toronto-based retail division for more than $100 million to a group
of Canadian investors led by Stanley Goldfarb and Fred Karp,
chairman of Speedy Muffler King.
   The retail unit, which accounted for $260 million of the
automotive division's $1.7 billion in 1988 revenue, operates 709
muffler shops under the Speedy Muffler King, Car-X and Pit-Stop
names in five countries.
   In a related move, Tenneco said the automotive division also
completed the acquisition of a non-asbestos brake manufacturing
facility in Cartersville, Ga., from Interfriction USA and Friction
Materials Corp. of America for an undisclosed sum.
   The transactions follow the recently announced $100 million
acquisition of the suspension division of Armstrong Equipment PLC of
the United Kingdom, a manufacturer of ride control systems.
   ``To strategically position Tenneco Automotive for the
competitive decade ahead, we are initiating aggressive actions to
redeploy capital,'' said Tenneco Chairman James L. Ketelsen said in
a statement.
   Tenneco, a diversified manufacturer based in Houston, has
business interests in natural gas pipelines, farm and construction
equipment, shipbuilding, chemicals and minerals.

   Grain futures prices were mostly higher, but corn
and soybeans mostly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weather, specifically the rain over the weekend, was responsible
for both trends.
   The heavy rain in Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Midwest delayed
harvest of the winter wheat crop and helped support prices. But the
same storms reached into the corn and soybean belt of the upper
Midwest and nourished the still-developing crops in Iowa, Illinois
and Indiana.
   Hanging over the markets' head today is a winter wheat production
report scheduled for release after the close of trading. That
estimate is expected to show this year's crop declined by about 8
percent from last year.
   On the open, wheat was 1 cent lower to 2} cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.89\ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1} cents lower, with July at $2.50 a bushel; oats were 2} cents

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected appeals by an
international iron workers union and a local affiliate found to have
discriminated against black construction workers.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that a union
training program for granting journeyman status to workers was
biased against blacks.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April that the
International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron
Workers and Local 201 in the District of Columbia area practiced
illegal bias.
   Eight black rodmen _ construction workers who position steel rods
to reinforce building materials _ sued the union in 1975. Ten years
passed before a federal judge issued a ruling that found
discrimination.
   The appeals court upheld key portions of the judge's decision,
finding that blacks were victimized by a program that trained
apprentice workers to become journeymen.
   Qualifying as a journeyman was crucial for getting work,
particularly in the mid-1970s when commercial construction slumped
in the capital city area.
   The appeals court based its finding of discrimination largely on
statistical evidence that showed the training program had a
disproportionate impact in denying union admission to blacks.
   The black workers said the program created unnecessary barriers
that delayed or barred them from becoming journeymen even though
they were qualified.
   The parent union and its local argued that the real source of the
disparity was the higher percentage of blacks who dropped out of the
training program. But the appeals court said union officials failed
to meet their burden of disproving bias.
   ``Absent rebuttal, the fact of disproportionately high minority
dropouts demonstrates the effectiveness of the barrier to (union)
membership represented by Local 201's educational requirements,
particularly the training program,'' the appeals court said.
   It added that the union failed to explain why classroom training
is essential for becoming a journeyman for those arleady experienced
and able.
   The appeals court noted that for a brief period in 1971 workers
were allowed to take an exam to qualify as journeymen without
completing a training program.
   That proves that work experience alone can qualify one to be a
joureyman rodman, the appeals court said.
   The appeals court ruled that workers with 3,000 hours of
experience may take an exam to become journeymen without undergoing
any classroom instruction.
   The cases are International Association of Iron Workers vs.
Berger, 88-699, and Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen vs. Berger,
88-820.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set aside a federal
appeals court ruling that USX Corp. illegally discriminated against
blacks at a Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill.
   The justices told the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals to restudy the USX case in light of their decision last
week making it far more difficult for workers to win some job-bias
lawsuits.
   The appeals court had ruled that USX, formerly known as U.S.
Steel Corp., discriminated against blacks who applied for
non-skilled production and maintenance jobs at the steel mill.
   A federal judge in 1983 ordered USX to end all discrimination in
the hiring of production and maintenance employees at the Fairless
Hills mill, and awarded more than $12.3 million to those represented
by a class action suit.
   The judge ruled that statistics showing the disparity between the
percentages of black applicants and black hires proved that USX
violated a federal anti-bias law, known as Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. But the judge said intentional discrimination
had not been proved.
   The 3rd Circuit court, in considering the ensuing cross-appeals,
ruled that both a Title VII violation and intentional discrimination
had been proved.
   The appeals court also ordered the trial judge to reconsider the
monetary award in a way USX lawyers said could raise the award to
``the range of $30 million.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for USX said the 3rd
Circuit court ruling means ``an employer's only protection against
Title VII liability is to adopt a quota system.''
   A very similar rationale was cited by the Supreme Court last week
when the justices, in a major civil rights decision, split 5-4 in
strengthening employers' defenses against charges of bias.
   The Fairless Hills mill, where 7,000 to 10,000 workers are
employed at a given time, hired 5,516 people _ including 977 blacks
_ to production and maintenance jobs in the years 1971-82.
   In those years, blacks represented 25.9 percent of the applicants
and 17.6 percent of the hires. Hiring was based on many subjective
criteria.
   The appeals court said statistical studies showed ``that USX's
hiring practice had a statistically significant adverse impact upon
blacks.''
   After finding that USX had no valid reason for the statistical
disparity, the appeals court ruled that the corporation also had
practiced intentional discrimination.
   The case is USX vs. Green, 88-141.

   As the dollar has surged upward in foreign
exchange of late, many people in the financial world have been
cheering it on.
   If there were no emotions involved, their response might well be
less exuberant. Many economists are busy right now drawing up lists
of the hazards, as well as the benefits, that a rising dollar poses
_ for instance, a prospective loss of competitive edge in the global
marketplace.
   But there are emotions involved. A nation's currency in many ways
symbolizes its strength or weakness and the confidence, or lack of
confidence, that its people might be entitled to feel.
   Some observers also hail the dollar's gains as tangible evidence
that rival ideas _ specifically communism _ to the United States'
capitalist system are being put to flight.
   ``Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the
capitalist system was to debauch the currency,'' the eminent
economist John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1931.
   ``By a continuing process of inflation, governments can
confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth
of their citizens...Lenin was certainly right.''
   In the last 25 years or so, American currency has taken a lot of
punches. Though it has evaded any knockout blows, it certainly has
been bruised.
   A penny saved is no longer a penny earned. In the late 1980s, a
penny saved is pointless.
   Even if inflation in this country remains at ``only'' 5 percent,
the Wall Street Journal notes, in less than three decades a dollar
will have shrunk to a quarter in purchasing power.
   Nevertheless, such scary images pale beside the economic
nightmare now unfolding in Argentina.
   That nation's inflation rate is projected at something like
12,000 percent this year, propelling it to the brink of calamity.
``Our money is worthless,'' a worker at the National Mint told a New
York Times reporter.
   The dollar's strong showing and Argentina's woes have provided a
new platform for monetarism, a school of economic thought that
emphasizes the importance of the amount of money circulating through
the system.
   Inflation, monetarists contend, is not caused by droughts or oil
embargoes or other such events. It results from too much growth in
the supply of money.
   ``If a country like Argentina didn't exist, monetarists would
have to invent it just to have a laboratory in which to prove their
theories,'' says Norman Fosback, editor of the financial advisory
letter Market Logic in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   ``In the last 14 years, the U.S. money supply expanded about
3{-fold. Argentina's money supply, by comparison, expanded more than
3{ MILLION-fold in the same period.''
   Over the last year, by some measures, money supply growth as
managed by the Federal Reserve in this country has been virtually
nil. To some observers, that, and the dollar's recent rise, mean an
increasing risk of recession.
   ``The coming downturn will be exacerbated by the Federal
Reserve's supertight monetary policy,'' contends Erich Heinemann,
chief economist at the investment firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   With a continued rise in the dollar, Heinemann says, ``the growth
of exports should slow to a crawl. The more the dollar goes up, the
bigger the risk the U.S. will slide into a recession.''
   But Fosback, for one, doesn't agree. In stark contrast to the
Argentinian example, he says, ``we think recent careful control of
U.S. money supply will soon be reflected in declining inflation and
enhanced long-term prosperity.''

   Shares fell in London on Monday on news of a
faster-than-expected gain in British retail sales in May, which
fueled fears that British interest rates may be headed higher.
   But trading activity was light, as players were reluctant to

   Many players also were awaiting the U.S. trade report and British
inflation figure later this week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 3.8
points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,138.3.
   Volume was 381.1 million shares, down from Friday's 528.2 million
shares.
   The retail sales figures showed volume up 2.5 percent in May from
April and up 4.1 percent from May 1988. That compared with market
expectations for a month-on-month rise of 0.8 percent and a
2.4-percent gain for the year.

<TEXT>
   European foreign ministers Monday approved the
start of talks that could lead to increased trade and economic
cooperation between the European Economic Community and the Soviet
Union.
   Nico Wegter, spokesman for the 12-nation trading bloc, said the
foreign ministers gave a mandate for the talks to the European
Commission, the community's executive body.
   The talks will center on a number of areas, including science and
technology, economic, monetary and banking questions, environmental
protection and agriculture.
   Wegter said the EEC would be prepared to discuss cooperation in
nuclear research, including the safety aspects of nuclear energy.
   No specific timetable was set for the talks.
   In advance of the negotiations, the community and the Soviet
Union have held a series of meetings, described as exploratory
talks, designed to determine what each side would want in a trade
agreement.
   EEC officials said the Soviets indicated they would be interested
in an accord with the richer European countries in various areas,
including high technology. Transferring sensitive technology to
Moscow is restricted.
   The community, excluding Greece, imported nearly $13 billion
worth of goods from the Soviet Union last year and exported products
worth about $10 billion. The EEC had a 1988 trade deficit with
Moscow of nearly $3 billion.
   The trading bloc has been negotiating trade agreements with East
European countries.
   Last June, it established official relations with the Soviet-led
socialist economic bloc, known as the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance, ending three decades of estrangement between Europe's
economic halves.
   Moscow's partners in Comecon are East Germany, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, plus Vietnam, Cuba
and Mongolia.
   Since then, the community has signed a trade and cooperation
agreement with Hungary and a trade accord in manufactured goods with
Czechoslovakia. Talks on trade pacts also have been held with
Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany.

<HEAD>Statoil To Sall Share in Norwegian Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway's state oil company Statoil A-S
announced plans Monday to sell part of its holdings in an offshore
oil field for the first time.
   Statoil said it signed a letter of intent with Japan's Idemitsu
Oil Exploration to sell a 9.6 percent interest in two offshore
blocks covering parts of the Snorre and Statfjord East fields.
   The sale price of up to $214 million is linked to future oil
prices. The deal must be approved by Japan and Norway, which could
take up to four months, the company said in a statement.
   The sale would reduce Statoil's Snorre offshore field share to
41.8 percent, its lowest interest in any license awarded since 1973.
   Parliament in March said Statoil could reduce its stake from a
normal minimum of 50 percent to 35 percent in some cases. Reducing
its Snorre share could save Statoil about $270 million in field
development costs, officials siad.
   Statoil has cut costs and investments to improve its capital
base, which was reduced by low oil prices, high operating costs and
cost overruns at a refinery project.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures prices were mostly higher, while
corn and soybeans were mixed to mostly lower Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Weather, the dominant feature in the market, was behind both
trends. But the U.S. Agriculture Department's monthly crop estimate
on winter wheat production also had some effect.
   The report, scheduled for release after the close of trading, was
expected to show this year's crop declined by about 8 percent from
last year.
   ``Nobody figured the change would be a major one, but it still
made people want to square up their positions before it came out,''
said Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York.
   Heavy rain in Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Midwest delayed
harvest of the winter wheat crop and helped support prices
throughout the day.
   But the same storms reached into the corn and soybean belt of the
upper Midwest and nourished the still-developing crops in Iowa,
Illinois and Indiana. And with prices sliding for nearly four weeks,
several of the old-crop months in beans touched new contract lows.
   On the close, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 2\ cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.88\ a bushel; corn was 2\
cents lower to 4 cents higher, with July at $2.49{ a bushel; oats

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. John Glenn has warned the Bush
administration that the possible sale to China of millions of
dollars worth of surplus equipment from a closed nuclear plant could
violate a congressional resolution.
   Glenn, D-Ohio, said the sale even without the actual reactor from
the Washington Public Power Supply System plant would be worth $500
million.
   He warned that such a deal would violate a 1985 resolution
barring the sale of U.S. reactors or fuel to China until the
president had certified that China would abide by various nuclear
non-proliferation pacts.
   Glenn, in a letter to Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
obtained Monday, said if such a deal was approved it would
``represent an extremely inauspicious beginning for the new
administration in the field of nuclear non-proliferation.''
   A staff member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
which Glenn chairs, said the Commerce Department subsequently told
the senator it would not issue any export licenses for the sale
until after consulting with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   ``We have been told by Commerce they would withhold any further
action until they hear from the NRC,'' said the staffer, who asked
not to be named.
   A spokesman for the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export
Administration declined immediate comment.
   A spokesman for the supply system at its Richland, Wash.,
headquarters said WPPSS has been trying for several years to sell
equipment from its terminated No. 5 plant to the Chinese, but export
licenses from the federal government had to be secured first.
   Spokesman Gary Petersen said the supply system would like export
licenses to sell the plant's actual reactor, 250,000 pounds of
nuclear fuel and what is called the ``balance of the plant''
including its turbines.
   Both plants, beset with enormous cost overruns and years behind
schedule, were terminated in the early 1980s when new forecasts
showed the power they would produce wouldn't be needed.
   Petersen declined to comment on Glenn's $500 million pricetag for
the sale.
   Glenn wrote Mosbacher early last month before the Chinese
government cracked down on student protesters.

<HEAD>Apple Announces Better Communications For Macintosh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. on Monday announced
communications products for its Macintosh that analysts said should
help the company plug more of the machines into Fortune 1000
computer networks.
   The new products make it easier for people to use Macintosh
personal computers to get at information stored on equipment made by
International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and
others.
   ``The bottom line is that these are products that are going to be
very attractive to large corporations,'' said Walter Winnitzki, an
analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   Apple has to overcome a preference among some corporate computer
managers for buying all their equipment, from mainframes to personal
computers, from a single company, often IBM. It does that by trying
to convince the managers that Apple can plug into big IBM computers
as easily as IBM itself does.
   ``This begins to put Apple into strategic planners' eyes,'' said
Jonathan Eunice, an analyst for D.H. Brown Associates Inc.
   Apple's strong suit is the popularity of the Macintosh itself.
The computer's ease-of-use features are being imitated by IBM and
others.
   ``They have lost a five-year lead but they retain a two-year lead
at least,'' Eunice said.
   Some big corporate customers are reluctant to rely on the
Macintosh because Apple is the only company that makes it. In
contrast, IBM's original personal computer was widely copied, and
IBM has been trying, with limited success, to encourage controlled
cloning of its new Personal System-2 line.
   But while Apple's tight grip on the Macintosh is a hindrance in
some respects, Apple sees it as an advantage, Donald Casey, the vice
president of networking and communications, said in an interview.
   ``We control the whole experience. ... We strongly believe the
whole is greater than the sum of the parts,'' he said.
   Apple announced enhancements in the AppleTalk networking system,
which connects Apple computers to each other; bridges to other
networks such as IBM's Token Ring, Digital's DecNet, TCP-IP and Open
Systems Interconnect; and communications tools including CL-1, which
allows Macintosh programs to get at data stored on other computers.
   The products should appeal to users who want to stick with their
familiar Macintosh commands and still get the power of a network of
different kinds of computers, said Win Farrell, a computer
consultant at Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
   ``Time will tell whether the users are sufficiently impressed to
adopt this,'' he said.

   The stock market managed a mixed performance in
light trading today, benefiting from an afternoon recovery in blue
chip issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials traded in negative
territory for much of the session but gradually regained lost ground
in the afternoon.
   Wall Street analysts attributed today's early weakness to
continuing interest by investors to collect profits made during the
recent advance powered by takeover activity.
   They said underlying sentiment still seems positive toward the
market, which is why no prolonged, substantial selloff developed.
   Eugene Peroni, market strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.,
attributed the market's overall showing to a normal round of
profit-taking that typically follows an advance and he characterized
the selling as modest.
   ``I'm very encouraged by the market's behavior,'' said Peroni,
noting that investors may be refraining from significant new buying
until they have seen convincing evidence of a sustained decline in
interest rates.

<HEAD>No Decision on Prime Computer Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge reserved decision Monday on a
motion to force Prime Computer Inc. to hold its annual meeting this
month so shareholders can vote on a challenge from hostile bidder
MAI Basic Four Inc.
   MAI Basic argued in Chancery Court that Prime violated state law
by delaying the annual meeting.
   Prime, based in Natick, Mass., originally scheduled the meeting
for May 12, but postponed it until June 14 and again until July 26.
Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic is seeking an injunction to force the
Wednesday meeting.
   Both companies are incorporated in Delaware.
   MAI Basic, which originally offered $20 per share for Prime,
lowered its offer June 1 to $19.50 per share. The new offer values
Prime at about $975 million, down from $1.3 billion in cash.
   MAI Basic attorney Michael Goldman said postponement of the
annual meeting violated corporate law that requires an annual
meeting to be held within 13 months of the previous meeting. Prime's
last annual meeting was May 1988.
   Goldman argued the delay prohibits shareholders from voting on a
new board of directors and on whether to accept MAI Basic's offer.
   Prime attorney Paul K. Rowe said the meeting was changed because
of MAI Basic's revised offer, adding that the company wanted about a
month ``to develop new alternatives'' to ward off a takeover.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Manufacturers' Discount Issue in Washington State
Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS 8th graf, The jury, to show award was against Texaco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether manufacturers legally may give some discounts to wholesalers
but not retailers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Texaco Inc., ordered to
pay $1.35 million in antitrust damages to 12 service stations in the
Spokane, Wash., area.
   Texaco's appeal was supported by leading business groups,
including the National Association of Manufacturers and the American
Petroleum Institute.
   The groups said a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
against Texaco ``threatens to undermine perhaps the most common
distributional arrangement in American business: the dual channel
system in which a manufacturer or supplier sells to wholesalers at
discounted prices lower than those it charges direct purchasing
retailers.''
   Asked by the court for its views, the Bush administration said
the Texaco appeal should be denied.
   Justice Department lawyers said they were ``troubled'' by some of
the 9th Circuit court's opinion but added that the ruling can be
interpreted narrowly.
   The appeals court last March upheld a jury verdict that Texaco
practiced illegal price discrimination in violation of the
Robinson-Patman Act, a federal antitrust law.
   The jury ordered Texaco to pay $449,900 in damages _ a sum
tripled by the judge to $1.35 million in accord with the antitrust
law.
   ``Sufficient evidence was introduced to support the finding that
(the service stations) suffered an antitrust injury and that
Texaco's unlawful price discrimination was a material cause of that
injury,'' the appeals court said in upholding the tripled award.
   The 12 service station dealers said that from 1972 to 1981 they
were placed at an unfair competitive disadvantage because Texaco
supplied gasoline to two Spokane-area wholesalers, John Dompier Oil
Co. and Gull Oil Co., at prices ranging from 2.5 cents to 5.75 cents
per gallon less than Texaco charged retailers.
   Dompier sold the gasoline to retailers under the Texaco
trademark. Gull marketed it under private brand names.
   The 12 service stations who sued Texaco said they suffered
because at least part of the discounts were passed on to consumers
by competing retailers who bought from Dompier and Gull.
   Texaco argued that the discounts were legitimate since they were
available to all wholesalers who purchased from Texaco.
   But the 9th Circuit court said there was evidence that the
services offered by Gull and Dompier ``were insubstantial and did
not justify the functional discount'' they received from Texaco.
   For example, the appeals court said, there was evidence that
``Gull's role as a middleman amounted only to engaging in paper
transactions'' and ``Texaco delivered gasoline directly to Dompier's
customers in some instances.''
   The case is Texaco vs. Hasbrouck, 87-2048.

<HEAD>Sets Aside Ruling in USX Case, Rejects Union Appeal in Construction
Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Scotus Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court gave a mixed response to
three unrelated job discrimination-complaint cases Monday, ruling
favorably for employers in two of them and vindicating alleged bias
victims in the third.
   The court set aside a lower-court ruling that USX Corp. illegally
discriminated against blacks at a steel mill and in a separate case
it limited deadlines for filing some lawsuits that accuse employers
of illegal sex bias. But the court rejected appeals by an iron
workers union found to have discriminated against blacks.
   In the USX case, the justices told the Philadelphia-based 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to restudy it in light of their
decision last week making it far more difficult for workers to win
some job-bias lawsuits.
   The appeals court had ruled that USX, formerly known as U.S.
Steel Corp., discriminated against blacks who applied for
non-skilled production and maintenance jobs at the steel mill.
   A federal judge in 1983 ordered USX to end discrimination in the
hiring of production and maintenance employees at the Fairless
Hills, Pa., steel mill and awarded more than $12.3 million to those
represented by a class action suit.
   The judge ruled that statistics showing the disparity between the
percentages of black applicants and black hires proved that USX
violated a federal anti-bias law, known as Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. But the judge said intentional discrimination
had not been proved.
   The 3rd Circuit court, in considering the ensuing cross-appeals,
ruled that both a Title VII violation and intentional discrimination
had been proved.
   In the appeal acted on Monday, lawyers for USX said the 3rd
Circuit court ruling means ``an employer's only protection against
Title VII liability is to adopt a quota system.''
   The Supreme Court cited a similar rationale last week when the
justices, in a major civil rights decision, split 5-4 in
strengthening employers' defenses against charges of bias.
   In a second job-discrimination case, the court on Monday threw
out a suit by three women who said a change in the seniority system
at an AT&amp;T plant in Illinois discriminated against them.
   The court said the women waited too long to sue.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the women had
300 days to sue from the time the seniority system change was
adopted _ not 300 days from the time they were affected personally
by the new seniority rules.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the
ruling shields acts of intentional discrimination.
   The case involves Patricia A. Lorance, Janice M. King and Carol
S. Bueschen, employees in AT&amp;T's Montgomery Works in Aurora, Ill.
   In the third discrimination case, the court let stand a ruling
that an iron-workers union training program for granting journeyman
status to workers was biased against blacks.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington ruled last April
that the International Association of Bridge, Structural and
Ornamental Iron Workers and Local 201 in the District of Columbia
area practiced illegal bias.
   Eight black rodmen _ construction workers who position steel rods
to reinforce building materials _ sued the union in 1975. Ten years
passed before a federal judge issued a ruling that found
discrimination.
   The appeals court upheld key portions of the judge's decision,
finding that blacks were victimized by a program that trained
apprentice workers to become journeymen.
   In other cases Monday, the Supreme Court:
   _Ruled that state taxes may be imposed when bankrupt companies
sell assets. By a 6-3 vote in a California case, the justices said
the taxes may be imposed on such sales and on a buyer's subsequent
use of the assets when bankrupt companies are ordered to liquidate.
   _Refused to let companies involved in treating hazardous waste
sue for stricter standards that could increase their business volume
or give them a competitive advantage over other waste-treatment
companies.
   _Made it easier to recover lawyers' fees for people who win
disputes with the government over Social Security benefits. The
court said the government must reimburse legal fees incurred during
proceedings that a federal court has ordered the Department of
Health and Human Services to conduct.
   _Agreed to consider reinstating a $6.1 million award against the
Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting firm, won by investors in the Farmer's
Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma.

<HEAD>Northwest Pilots Threaten Strike Amid Takeover Offers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union pilots at Northwest Airlines on Monday
threatened to strike if its parent company, NWA Inc., is taken over
by a buyer who would saddle the carrier with debt.
   ``This letter is to serve notice that our concern for the
long-term survival and success of Northwest Airlines must be the
cornerstone of any new contract,'' leaders of the 5,000-member Air
Line Pilots Association said in the letter addressed to all bidders
and the company's board of directors.
   ``Excessive debt incurred in connection with any transaction
involving Northwest Airlines or NWA Inc. is something we simply will
not accept,'' the pilots said in the letter, published as an ad in
the Wall Street Journal. ``We may have no choice except to take
whatever action we can to ensure the continued growth and prosperity
of'' the carrier.
   H.T. Dodge and Kirk Faupel, co-chairman of the union, said ``a
pilot strike will be inevitable'' if their concerns are not resolved.
   The pilots are the only union at Northwest with an open contract.
About half of the pilots are working under a three-year agreement
signed with the old Northwest Orient in 1983.
   The other half are working under terms of a 1984 contract signed
with Republic Airlines, which Northwest acquired in the fall of
1986. The old Republic contract ran out in 1987.
   The letter said too much debt would render Northwest Airlines a
``financially crippled second-tier carrier, ill equipped to meet the
challenges of business cycles, the economic and safety demands of
fleet replacement, and the global competitive threat of
government-subsidized foreign mega-carriers.''
   A message to pilots recorded on Friday said mediated talks with
Northwest management are scheduled to resume Tuesday. The message
said significant progress has been made on a variety of contract
issues since May.
   A second round of bidding for Northwest Airlines comes to a close
Friday. Seven bidders representing a range of interests have already
submitted bids but other offers are possible.
   NWA should fetch in excess of $3.3 billion and perhaps more than
$3.6 billion, based on details of the offers made during the first
round. NWA's board has said it may decide to reject all offers.

<HEAD>Gasoline Futures Prices Drop on Technical Factors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline futures prices tumbled on largely
technical factors Monday, carrying crude and home heating oil
futures along the way.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery fell 1.99 cents a
gallon to 61.73 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said the gasoline market traded down as investors with
long positions sold off some holdings.
   ``The market continued to move lower and developed a momentum of
its own'' after falling through the 47 cents level, Beutel said.
   Meanwhile, the July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, dropped 62 cents to $19.26 a
gallon on the heels of the gasoline decline.
   Beutel described Monday's trading as ``the gas and the crude
working hand and glove.''
   Home heating oil, brought lower by technical and seasonal
factors, slumped 1.58 cents a gallon to settle at 45.45 cents.

<HEAD>Union Threatens `War' In Bid For Apparel Maker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A textile union said Monday it plans a joint bid
with a Tennessee businessman for apparel maker Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co.
and threatened that another buyer would ``risk being at war with
their own employees.''
   The Amalgamated Clothing &amp; Textile Workers Union said workers
would not cooperate with another buyer of the company that makes
Arrow shirts now owned by Farley Inc.
   ``We're here to put on notice other potential bidders, and the
lenders for these bidders, that we are unequivocally opposed to any
bids other than by the employees,'' said Garry Ferraris, an ACTWU
vice president.
   He said the union has joined with Nashville, Tenn., businessman
Spencer Hays, a publisher who owns several clothing businesses, to
prepare an offer for Cluett.
   Preliminary plans call for a leveraged buyout with Hays putting
up most of the cash and employees retaining about 30 percent of the
stock and a voice in major decisions affecting the compan, he said.
   Chicago-based Farley reportedly want to sells Cluett to help
erase some of the debt associated with its $3 billion acquisition of
West Point, Ga.-based WestPoint Pepperell Inc. earlier this year.
   Farley spokesman Jack Albertine was traveling Monday and could
not be reached for comment.
   Jay Meltzer, a textile industry analyst with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
in New York, said the union's action was unusual but should not
deter other potential bidders.
   Ferraris said employees are opposed to other bidders because
Cluett has changed hands twice in the last four years. It was
acquired by WestPoint Pepperell in 1985 and switched again in the
Farley deal.
   Ferraris said employees do not feel secure and a new owner could
shift Cluett jobs overseas. Ferraris said about five potential
bidders exist for Cluett, including the shirt manufacturer
Phillips-Van Heusen.
   The value of a union offer has not been determined, Ferraris
said. Dale Allen, an ACTWU leader, said the company has been valued
as high as $800 million.
   Ferraris said union leaders discussed their plans with Farley
Chairman William Farley. He said Farley indicated he wanted to allow
several parties to bid on Cluett.
   Cluett also manufactures Gold Toe socks and J. Schoeneman suits.
Its factories in Georgia, Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and Delaware employ more than 8,000 people.

   Traders in Asia and Europe drove the dollar to
long-time highs against major foreign currencies on Monday,
increasing American buying power but further jeopardizing progress
on cutting the U.S. trade deficit.
   The dollar reached a 22-month high against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo and a 30-month high against the West German mark in Europe
before retreating slightly in U.S. trading.
   Gold prices recovered somewhat in U.S. trading after Friday's
steep plunge, which knocked prices down as much as $15 a troy ounce.
   Dealers cited several factors in the dollar rally, including the
image of the United States as a safe haven from political
uncertainty, but said market sentiment was the main force.
   ``This is not all psychological, although a good chunk of it is
psychological,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase
Manhattan Bank.
   The dollar rally could harm the U.S. economy as soon as the end
of the year by prompting companies to cut back on their spending on
new plants and equipment, Fine said.
   The companies would cut back, he said, out of a belief that the
strength of the dollar would reduce their ability to compete with
foreign manufacturers, although it is too soon to see such effects
yet.
   There were rumors that the Federal Reserve sold dollars in New
York trading in an attempt to restrain the U.S. currency, but the
supposed action had little effect.
   The Bank of Canada intervened in Europe, but no other central
banks were sighted, dealers there said.
   The latest phase of the dollar's climb gained strength Friday on
news of an unexpectedly large 0.9 percent increase in U.S. producer
prices in May. That strengthened expectations U.S. monetary policy
would remain tight for some time, sustaining high interest rates
that support demand for dollars.
   ``As far as I'm concerned this dollar is in a definite uptrend
and it's a question of the market looking around for the
fundamentals to explain it,'' said Susan Babcock, a chief corporate
foreign-exchange dealer at Marine Midland Bank.
   In London, the British pound tumbled nearly 3 cents, falling to
$1.5250 from $1.5545 late Friday. In New York, sterling fell to
$1.5285 from $1.5485 on Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 148.40 yen, up 4.90 yen from Friday and the
highest there since it closed at 148.55 yen on Aug. 18, 1987.
   Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 148.76 yen.
In New York the dollar closed at 148.46 yen, up from 146.49 on
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 2.0195 West German marks, up from 2.0100; 1.7470
Swiss francs, down from 1.7475; 1.2011 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2015; 6.8420 French francs, up from 6.7987; and 1,460.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,457.80.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
2.0250 West German marks, up from 2.0025; 1.7550 Swiss francs, up
from 1.7402; 6.8620 French francs, up from 6.7810; 2.2835 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.2510; 1,463.50 Italian lire, up from 1,450.50;
and 1.2024 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1999.
   The mark closing in Europe was the highest since the dollar
closed at 2.0255 on Dec. 12, 1986.
   Gold prices fell in Asia and Europe, catching up with the drop
late Friday in New York. But they rose in New York from Friday's
lows.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $1.47 a troy ounce to a bid of $359.03.
   Gold fell in London to $359.95 from late Friday's $363.25. In
Zurich, gold fell to a bid $359.00 from $368.05.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $361.90 a troy ounce from $358.10 on Friday.
   Later Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$360.70 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $357 on Friday.
   Silver bullion prices fell in London to a late bid of $5.20 a
troy ounce from Friday's $5.27. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.202 an ounce from $5.162.

   The stock market managed a mixed performance
Monday, benefiting from an afternoon comeback led by the blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed with a gain of
5.42, at 2,518.84 after trading in negative territory for much of
the session.
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 772 down, 714
up and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 151.46 million
shares, down from 173.24 million in the previous session.
   Wall Street market watchers attributed the early setback to sales
aimed at collecting profits amassed during the recent advance
inspired by takeover speculation. Some of the early selling also was
due to trading maneuvers associated with stock index futures.
   Michael Metz, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said when the
market suffered its sinking spell early in the day, would-be buyers
were standing on the sidelines watching how far share prices would
fall.
   Before long, these hesistant investors began nibbling again at
stocks they considered attractive buys, said Metz.
   Analysts say the sentiment seems very positive toward stocks,
particularly because the dollar's surge has started drawing in
investment money from abroad. Declining interest rates also have
steered investors to equities.
   Much of the impetus for the rebound in the Dow Jones industrial
average came from a jump in Procter &amp; Gamble shares to a 52-week
high. The stock, driven higher by report of a favorable revision in
an analyst's earnings estimate, closed at 110|, up 5}.
   Takeover stocks also figured in the renewed buying. Time gained
4} to 175 as rumors of a new bid for the communications giant
rippled through the market. Paramount Communications, whose $10.7
billion-bid for Time has left Time's planned merger with Warner
Communications in limbo, fell 1~ to 57. Warner fell 1] to 54}.
   Burlington Resources topped the list of actively traded issues on
the Big Board, with more than 9.2 million shares changing hands.
Burlington Resources sported a gain of 1 at 44~; the company
confirmed that it has been buying back its shares in recent days.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business Machines
rose { to 108~, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was off [ at 36[ and
Eastman Kodak lost |, closing at 49}.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 178.22 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market was off $3.98 billion, or 0.12
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks ended
at 182.14, down 0.23.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.32 to 373.21, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index finished with a decline of 0.45 at 326.24.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.26 to 453.39. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 365.89, down 0.27.

   Up to 10,000 coal miners walked off the job
Monday in southern West Virginia and threatened to take the wildcat
strike nationwide.
   The walkout followed a rally Sunday at which United Mine Workers
President Richard Trumka told miners to ``rise up and fight back''
in support of 1,600 miners on strike in West Virginia and Virginia
against Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   In the Pittston strike, a judge in Virginia has jailed three
union leaders and fined the union more than $3 million for violating
a ban on mass picketing.
   ``They're protesting the excessive fines and the jailing of the
three union officers down in Virginia,'' said Dave Evans, a Pittston
miner. ``They're going to try to shut down all the union and
non-union mines by the end of next week. You'll see a nationwide and
Canadian strike _ whatever it takes to get this settled.''
   Monday's strikes spread throughout UMW District 17, which has
8,000 members in southern West Virginia.
   Gary White, president of the West Virginia Coal Association,
estimated more than 10,000 miners refused to show up for work.
   Under their 1988 contract, the miners can take a 10-day
``memorial period'' and walk off the job to air grievances but must
give notice beforehand.
   None of the coal companies struck Monday said they were informed
that this would be a 10-day work stoppage.
   West Virginia's largest coal field employer, Consolidation Coal,
immediately obtained a back-to-work order from U.S. District Judge
Dennis Knapp. The order is effective until June 22, when another
hearing is scheduled.
   Consol argued that when the 250 of its 4,000 workers walked out,
they violated a 1988 contract barring strikes and that the walkout
could keep the company from meeting contracts. The UMW did not send
attorneys to the hearing.
   In past wildcat strikes, the first shift out was the first shift
back. It that were to hold true in this case, Consol workers would
return at midnight Monday.
   Pittston miners struck April 5 after working more than 14 months
without a contract. Pittston had refused to sign the 1988 Bituminous
Coal Operators Association agreement, the contract which most other
coal companies signed.
   During the Pittston walkout, more than 2,200 miners, retirees and
their wives have been arrested for acts of civil disobedience such
as blocking coal trucks.
   Peabody Coal, the nation's top coal producer, had 2,360 union
miners walk out at midnight, said Tom Clarke, a Peabody attorney.
   ``No reason for the unauthorized work stoppage has been
communicated to managament,'' Clarke said. ``According to Peabody
policy, no discussions will be held with the miners until they have
returned to work.''
   Roger Caldwell, a UMW leader, said Sunday's crowd was ``whipped
up'' by Trumka.
   Top union leaders did not immediately return calls Monday.
   Trumka could not be reached at UMW headquarters in Washington or
in Charleston, where he led the 12,000-miner rally on the Capitol
steps Sunday.
   ``It's time for labor to rise up and fight back,'' Trumka said at
the rally. ``The 1990s will see us resisting like we did in the
'60s, in the streets, in the hallways, in the corridors of power.''

<HEAD>Tenneco Announces Restructuring in Automotive Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. said Monday it is selling its
Toronto-based automotive parts retail division for more than $100
million to a group of Canadian investors including the chairman of
Speedy Muffler King.
   Tenneco also also announced acquisition of an non-asbestos brake
manufacturing operation in Georgia as part of an automotive parts
division restructuring.
   Under the plan, Tenneco Automotive has agreed to sell its retail
division for more than $100 million to Canadian investors led by
Fred Karp, chairman of Speedy Muffler King.
   The retail unit, which accounted for $260 million of the
automotive division's $1.7 billion in 1988 revenue, operates 709
muffler shops under the Speedy Muffler King, Car-X and Pit-Stop
names in five countries.
   In a related move, Tenneco said the automotive division also
completed acquisition of a non-asbestos brake manufacturing facility
in Cartersville, Ga., from Interfriction USA and Friction Materials
Corp. of America for an undisclosed sum.
   Tenneco recently paid $100 million for the suspension division of
Armstrong Equipment PLC of Britain, which makes ride control systems.
   Tenneco said the transactions were designed to strengthen its
market position in the automotive parts business and generate an
estimated $46 million in available cash.
   Tenneco, a diversified manufacturer based in Houston, has
business interests in natural gas pipelines, farm and construction
equipment, shipbuilding, chemicals and minerals.

   Coffee futures prices plunged Monday after producers and
consumers failed to negotiate new export quotas and pricing levels
or to extend a current agreement.
   On other markets, cotton futures continued to rebound from last
week's losses tied to political unrest in China and petroleum
futures were down amid fears that dissension within OPEC will mean
more oil at cheaper prices.
   The world's leading coffee producers and consumers extended their
meeting in London through the weekend in an attempt to reach a new
agreement to replace one that expires Oct. 1.
   The major stumbling block is a request by the largest consumers _
notably the United States and Europe _ to end a two-tier system
allowing exporting countries to sell the commodity to non-members of
the International Coffeee Organization at prices below what ICO
members pay.
   ``There was pressure from the opening bell and it got stronger as
time went on and it became more apparent that no agreement was in
the offing,'' said Kim Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets,
Inc. in New York.
   Coffee settled 3.75 cents to 6.23 cents lower on the New York
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery in
July at 124.84 cents.
   Contracts for three of the four deferred months closed down the
6-cent daily trading limit; the 6.23-cent loss was for September
contracts, which have no limit.
   Cotton futures hit the daily limit as well, but on the upside.
Cotton settled 1.90 cents to 2 cents higher, with July at 66.95
cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
   ``We had some severe weather regarding the crop in the field, but
the climb was more a continuation from the support lines we put down
last week during the events in China,'' said Ed Whitten of Balfour
Maclaine Corp. in New York.
   Crude oil futures led the products in a downturn at the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
meeting last week in Vienna agreed to raise the cartel's daily
output from 18.5 million barrels per day to 19.5 million, although
most analysts say OPEC members already were producing closer to 21
million.
   Kuwait's official quota before the meeting was 1.037 million
barrels per day and was increased to 1.093 million. Analysts said
Kuwait's actual production was more than 2 million.
   Several of the nation's leaders were quoted Monday saying Kuwait
will maintain that level _ a signal that OPEC will be unable to
restrict production levels even to 19.5 million barrels per day for
the cartel.
   ``Then, there's the question of will they be cheating more with
higher quotas, or just the same?'' said Peter Beutel of Elders
Futures Inc. in New York. ``Does this mean 21 million or something
closer to 22 million?''
   Crude oil settled 42 cents to 63 cents lower, with July at $19.26
a barrel; heating oil was 1.58 cents to 1.79 cents lower, with July
at 45.45 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1.85 cents to 2
cents lower, with July at 61.73 cents a gallon.
   Grain futures prices were mostly higher, but corn and soybeans
mixed to mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weather, the dominant feature in the market, was behind both
trends.
   Heavy rain in Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Midwest delayed
harvest of the winter wheat crop and helped support prices
throughout the day.
   But the same storms reached into the corn and soybean belt of the
upper Midwest and nourished the still-developing crops in Iowa,
Illinois and Indiana.
   On the close, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 2\ cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.88\ a bushel; corn was 2\
cents lower to 4 cents higher, with July at $2.49{ a bushel; oats
were 3{ cents to 4{ cents lower, with July at $1.58 cents a bushel;
and soybeans were 8{ cents to 11} cents lower, with July at $6.94 a
bushel.
   Gold and silver both climbed at the Comex after a steep drop last
Friday. Gold settled $3.80 to $4.50 higher, with June at $361.90 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.1 cents to 4 cents higher, with June at
520.2 cents a troy ounce.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .80 cent higher, with June at 70.22
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .73 cent higher, with
August at 80.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .30 cent
higher, with June at 48.20 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were unchanged to 1.65 cents higher, with July at 33.60 cents a
pound.

   The Commerce Department withdrew an export
license for the sale of $500 million in nuclear power plant parts to
China after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Sen. John Glenn
protested, officials said Monday.
   ``We viewed it initially as an attempt to circumvent the law,''
said Leonard Weiss, staff director of the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs. ``We discovered the State Department wasn't
even aware of this export.''
   Glenn, chairman of the committee, complained in a letter to
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher that the shipment would
undercut a 1985 congressional resolution forbidding such sales
unless the president certified that China is not helping other
nations build nuclear weapons.
   The Ohio Democrat has been a frequent critic of what he calls
China's clandestine trade in nuclear-related materials with Third
World countries, particularly Pakistan and nations in the Middle
East.
   All of the equipment _ non-reactor items such as compressors,
pipes, turbine generators and other electrical gear _ was from a
canceled power plant at Satsop, Wash. The plant belongs to the
Washington Public Power Supply System, a consortium of publicly
owned local utilities.
   All of the licensing events occurred in May, before the Chinese
government's crackdown on student demonstrators in Beijing.
   WPPSS spokesman Gary Petersen said the consortium still wants to
sell the equipment to China.
   ``We knew all this unrest in China would delay things,'' Petersen
said. ``But it doesn't stop it.''
   WPPSS also sought licenses from the NRC and the State Department
to sell the plant's reactor and 250,000 pounds of enriched uranium
fuel to China.
   The NRC rejected those requests earlier this year because neither
President Bush nor President Reagan had certified that China is
abiding by nuclear non-proliferation safeguards.
   While the NRC is in charge of issuing export licenses for
reactors and nuclear fuel, the Commerce Deparment has export
licensing authority for all non-nuclear electric power plant
components.
   However, such licenses normally are not approved by either until
after interagency consultations among the NRC, the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency and the State, Commerce and Energy
departments.
   Because the non-nuclear components are so coupled with the
particular model of reactor at the WPPSS plant, the export licenses
for each make sense only if they are coordinated, said Harold
Denton, director of the NRC's office of governmental and public
affairs.
   He said the Commerce Department license was issued in early May
``without consulting with us.''
   It was withdrawn two weeks later when the NRC found out about it.
   ``It sounds to me like it was an oversight on their part, because
normally they do consult with us,'' Denton said about the Commerce
Department. ``In this case, they didn't. But they've corrected
that.''
   The Commerce Department has agreed to condition any license for
the export of non-nuclear components to NRC approval of the reactor
sale.
   Weiss said Commerce Deparment officials originally contended that
a non-proliferation declaration from Bush was not needed because the
license was only for non-nuclear components. However, Weiss said,
Mosbacher later told Glenn that the deal was being deferred until
after consultations with the NRC.
   A Commerce official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the department had no basis for denying the license because the
export was general, non-nuclear industrial equipment.
   ``The NRC and the State Department both had action on this and
none of it was going to go forward unless all three approved,'' said
the official. ``And we knew it was highly unlikely that the NRC was
going to approve it.''

<HEAD>Investment Firm Begins Tender Offer for Railroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of investors led by Blackstone Capital
Partners LP on Monday began its $1.6 billion buyout of about 17.5
million shares of CNW Corp. stock.
   The buyout group, which includes Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. and Robert Schmiege, chairman of Chicago-based CNW
Corp., entered into a merger agreement with CNW on June 6.
   Under the agreement, CNW Acquisition Corp., formed by the
investors to take over the railroad company, will pay $50 for each
of 14.8 million shares of common stock and $38.76 a share for
preferred stock. The offer is scheduled to expire July 11 unless
extended, CNW officials said.
   New York's Chemical Bank has committed $585 million and New
York-based Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette will provide up to $475
million to finance the buyout of CNW, the holding company for the
Chicago and North Western Transportation Co., a 6,000-mile railroad
with 8,500 employees that operates in nine states.
   Blackstone will hold a controlling interest in CNW, with minority
positions held by the railroad's management and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette.
   Bethlehem, Pa.-based Union Pacific Corp., a railroad and trucking
company, will hold $100 million of stock that will be convertible
into a minority position after five years.
   The offer for CNW by the Blackstone-led group forced the
withdrawal of an bid from New York-based Japonica Partners.
   Japonica had planned to sell CNW's real estate, excess equipment
and Chicago-area commuter lines if its $722 million offer for the
company had been successful.
   Officials said Blackstone's financing structure will not require
significant sales of operating assets to retire the debt caused by
the takeover, although the firm says it will follow through on CNW's
previously announced plan to sell its commuter line.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas, Airbus, Boeing Announce Orders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. on Monday announced that it had received
orders and options from four different airlines for 60 new MD-80
twin-jets.
   Separately, Europe's Airbus Industrie said it has received orders
from Korean Air for six of its A300-600r jets, and Boeing Co.
announced orders for two 747-400s and options for two more from
Asiana Airlines of South Korea.
   McDonnell Douglas, based in St. Louis, said the 60 new MD-80s
were ordered by Italy's Alitalia, Minerve SA and Air Liberte of
France, and Transwede of Sweden. Terms of the deals were not
disclosed.
   Alitalia, one of the largest MD-80 operators in the world, placed
25 orders and 25 options, McDonnell Douglas said. Deliveries are
scheduled to begin in 1993 and continue through 1997. The Italian
airline will select either MD-82s or MD-87s.
   MD-82s, MD-83s and MD-87s all are models in the company's MD-80
series.
   Minerve, a charter airline based in Paris, took options on two
MD-83s scheduled for 1994 delivery. Two MD-83s already are scheduled
for delivery to Minerve in November 1989 and April 1990.
   Paris-based Air Liberte placed two orders for MD-83s with
scheduled delivery in March 1991.
   Transwede turned two options into firm orders and took options on
an additional four MD-83s. The Swedish airline is scheduled to take
delivery on the new firm MD-83s in March 1991 and March 1992.
   At the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget, France, the Airbus
consortium announced it has received orders from Korean Air for six
of its wide-bodied A300-600r jets.
   Airbus did not disclose the value of the contract, but sources
close to the company said the price for an A300-600r is about $70
million. Prices vary depending on whether they include spare parts
and training.
   The aircraft, which will be delivered between January 1990 and
June 1991, will be powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.
   Boeing said in Seattle it has received orders for two 747-400s
and options for two more from Asiana Airlines of South Korea for
more than $285 million.
   The Boeing 747-400s will serve Asiana's new intercontinental
routes to Europe and the United States beginning in 1991.
   Separately, Pratt &amp; Whitney said in an announcement from East
Hartford, Conn., that Air Outre Mer of France has ordered Pratt &amp;
Whitney engines worth up to $268 million to power its newly acquired
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets.

   Pan Am has fired its security chief at the
Frankfurt, West Germany, airport, but the airline said Monday the
action was unrelated to Flight 103, which crashed over Lockerbie,
Scotland, after a bomb smuggled aboard the plane exploded.
   The bomb, hidden in a radio-cassette player, exploded in midair
on Dec. 21, killing all 259 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am
jumbo jet and 11 people on the ground. The flight originated in
Franfurt.
   Security chief Ulrick Weber was fired June 4 after anonymous
letters sent to Pan Am management accused him of misusing funds,
said Jeff Kriendler, a spokesman for Pan American World Airways at
its New York headquarters.
   ``We have indeed terminated his services,'' he said. ``It had to
do with the improper use of company funds for personal expenses.
   ``Some irregularities were brought to management's attention,''
Kriendler continued. `The company investigation revealed no evidence
that security was compromised by his personal misconduct.''

<HEAD>Northrop Corp. Division Under Investigation Over Defense Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents are investigating
Northrop Corp.'s Defense Systems Division here for possible
overcharging on military contracts, according to a published report.
   Company spokeswoman Maria Oharenko acknowledged the probe but
would not reveal its focus.
   ``We are aware of a government investigation and company
documents were subpoenaed,'' she said. ``We are working with the
government on the document request.''
   Agents from the U.S. Attorney's office visited the Defense
Systems Division in this Chicago suburb last week seeking documents
related to the probe, she told the Daily Herald in Arlington Heights.
   The newspaper reported last weekend that the probe involves
accusations that Northrop improperly billed the government for
defense work.
   Unidentified sources within the Defense Systems Division told the
paper they believe the probe centers on allegations that the
government was overcharged for labor and materials under certain
contracts.
   The investigation comes as parent Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles
faces a 167-count criminal indictment charging it supplied defective
parts and falsified test results on critical components of Air Force
cruise missles and Navy AV-8B Harrier jets.
   Ms. Oharenko said the local investigation is not related to that
criminal indictment.
   The Defense Systems Division, which makes radar-jamming equipment
for military aircraft, employs about 4,000 people at its
headquarters in Rolling Meadows and two other facilities in nearby
Arlington Heights and Elk Grove Village.
   The division produces systems to shield B-52 and B1-B bombers and
F-15 fighter jets from detection by enemy radar. It has suffered
from cutbacks in military spending and over the past year, and has
reduced its work force by more than 1,000 people through layoffs and
attrition.

<HEAD>Carmakers Say They Can Meet Pollution Curbs With New Technology</HEAD>

   Automakers said Monday they could develop
methanol-fueled vehicles to meet President Bush's clean-air
proposals but wonder if people are likely to buy them.
   Some practical hurdles the Big Three automakers cited including
making the fuel available, making methanol-powered engines start
better in cold weather and cutting their formaldehyde emissions.
   The cars can be made, said Kelly Brown, Ford Motor Co.'s
executive engineer in charge of fuel economy and emissions, but
``it's another thing to sell them.''
   ``Some people, when new technology comes out, want to be first on
board, and some want to sit back and wait and see how everyone else
does with it. Those are the ones we're worried about.''
   Bush called on Congress in a White House speech Monday to require
automakers to put 500,000 alternative-fuel vehicles in operation in
nine high-smog urban areas by 1996, and 1 million such vehicles a
year after that.
   Unlike gasoline, methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes smog
problems in nearly 100 metropolitan areas.
   Bush also proposed cutting tailpipe emissions from automobiles by
40 percent and curbing other automobile fuel-related pollutants.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly
said Bush's proposals to cut acid rain and industrial and automotive
smog would let all but the most severely polluted areas _ Los
Angeles, Houston and New York City _ meet federal air quality
standards by the year 2000.
   ``It is a tough proposal, but it does take into account some of
the technical difficulties we would face in meeting it,'' said
Harold A. Poling, Ford's vice chairman and chief operating officer.
   Any tighter standards probably would be unattainable and would
bring little improvement in air quality, Poling said.
   Ford favors a pilot program to resolve technical questions before
trying to switch to alternative fuel vehicles, he said.
   William H. Noack, a General Motors Corp. spokesman in Washington,
said GM also favors a pilot program.
   Noack said details will have to be fleshed out in ensuing
legislation and regulations. ``Just generally speaking, as you look
at the proposal, there is a good deal of flexibility in there,'' he
said.
   At Ford, Brown said engineers are trying to improve cold starting
of methanol engines and cut formaldehyde emissions, which are about
four times as high as from a gasoline engine.
   Chrysler Corp. questioned the speed of the program in a statement
issued by spokeswoman Karen Stewart. ``For example, it is not clear
how an abundant supply of alternate fuels will be produced and
distributed at prices attractive to the consumer,'' she said.
   Chrysler spokesman Ben Dunn said his company will deliver 10
vehicles fueled by an 85-percent methanol, 15-percent gasoline mix
to Southern California later this year for two years of tests in
fleet use.
   Dunn said methanol vehicles need larger tanks for the same travel
range as gasoline vehicles, and it remains unclear if methanol will
have corrosive effects on fuel system components in the long run.

<HEAD>Coming Soon, The $7.50 Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cineplex Odeon Corp. announced Monday it will
increase the weekend ticket price at its Manhattan theaters to
$7.50, blaming the hike on the cost renovating its movie houses and
high operating costs in New York.
   The 50-cent price increase takes effect Friday after 6 p.m. and
for all Saturday and Sunday shows at the Toronto-based company's 48
screens at 23 Manhattan theaters. Weekday prices remain the same.
   Cineplex bought the RKO Century Warner theater chain in 1986 and
noted Monday that it had pledged to renovate and refurbish each
theater in the New York area.
   By the end of August, the company said, it will have accomplished
that goal at 75 percent of its Manhattan screens.
   Cineplex broke the $6 ticket price barrier in Manhattan when it
raised it price to $7 in late 1987. The move prompted protests
outside its theaters that drew Mayor Edward I. Koch, among others.
   Cineplex is one of the largest film exhibitors in North America,
with 1,820 screens in 500 locations.
