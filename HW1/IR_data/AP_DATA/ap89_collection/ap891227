   Caesar glowered amid the holiday cheer.
   The gorilla clambered up the rocks and squatted, turning out his
lower lip in displeasure as the family ate its presents and a few
trees on Tuesday.
   Caesar's gloom was probably caused by a cold, but if the illness
was catching, his disposition wasn't. The rest of the gorilla
family and the family in the compound next door smelled the roses
and promptly ate them.
   The two families of gorillas at the Los Angeles Zoo were
released from their quarters at midmorning to find their compounds
were strewn with popcorn balls, cranberries, bougainvilleas,
rawhide chews and fruit.
   Banana trees decorated with purple, orange and yellow roses and
sprinkled with coconut snow stood outside the grottos, with boxed
presents all around.
   Burlap stockings were placed by the rocks with care, filled with
nuts and squash and all sorts of goodies.
   The holiday party was the work of volunteers from the Gorilla
Garden, which grows supplemental foods for the zoo's dozen gorillas.
   ``They enjoy it because a lot of their really special favorite
treats are out there,'' said Jennifer Chatfield, the gorillas'
keeper. ``They also have some things they don't usually get _ like
a whole banana tree.''

   Dave Lebiuk says he swims only
once a year _ the day after Christmas _ so he likes to make it last.
   That's why he was the last person out of the water Tuesday
during the annual ``polar bear'' swim at this Vancouver Island
city. The 35-year-old spent 30 minutes in the 50-degree waters of
Departure Bay.
   ``I started four years ago or more and I just keep doing it,''
he said as he dried off before heading for a hot tub set up on the
beach.
   The 196 participants who braved the chilly waters ranged in age
from 2-year-old Mary Rice to 76-year-old Patrick O'Rooney.
   Swimmers receive a silver dollar and polar bear pin for their
efforts.
   ``It's fun, but I think they're crazy,'' said 12-year-old Esther
McDonnall, who was visiting from Australia.

<TEXT>
   Edward VIII gave up his throne to marry Wallis
Simpson 53 years ago, but the romantic Windsor legend has come
alive again at their mansion in the Bois de Boulogne.
   In early December the wrought-iron gates of the final and
favorite residence of the duke and duchess of Windsor were thrown
open for a high tea given by Mohammed Al Fayed, the Egyptian tycoon
who paid more than $8 million to renovate the mansion.
   The owner of the Hotel Ritz in Paris and the Harrods department
store in London, Al Fayed plans to keep the mansion open for
friends and approved groups of visitors.
   ``Theirs was the love story of the century,'' Al Fayed said of
the Windsors. He undertook renovation with the blessing of Mayor
Jacques Chirac and the City of Paris, which is still the official
owner of the villa.
   Al Fayed said he had been shocked to see the dilapidated
condition of the villa when he visited after the duchess's death in
1986, with moldy walls and tags on the furniture and art objects
destined for the auction block.
   ``It was a sight I know would have appalled the duke and
duchess,'' he said, having seen the villa in its heyday at a dinner
party given by the duchess, the American socialite divorcee whom
the duke had married in defiance of the royal family.
   So Al Fayed took things in hand. Supervised by an Anglo-American
team of decorators, the leaky roof was repaired, the interior was
given a coat of paint, tapestries and woodwork were restored.
   Personal valuables were left in place, including framed intimate
letters and photographs and silver and crystal on the dining-room
table as if the Windsors were expecting guests. Countless porcelain
pug dogs around the house commemorate the Windsors' family pets who
always were given pride of place.
   ``I feel on top of the world,'' said Sydney Johnson, 69, the
duke's personal valet for more than 30 years, who is now
occasionally in attendance dressed splendidly in gold and red
livery as he was in the old days.
   ``I cried all through the party Mr. Al Fayed gave three years
ago to celebrate his lease on the house,'' said Johnson, a Bahamian
who was hired during World II when the duke was the governor of the
Bahamas. ``The restoration is so authentic I expect to see the
duchess stepping down the staircase asking, `How do I look?'''
   Also on hand are the Windsors' chauffeur of 20 years, Gregoire
Martin, and his wife, Maria. Martin said he had hidden 5,000
personal photographs in a bathroom to keep them from prying eyes
during the duchess's 14-year widowhood following the duke's death
in 1972.
   The house looks as if the Windsors just stepped out for a stroll
in the Bois; books are at the bedsides, brushes and combs are in
the bathrooms and some of the duchess's lingerie are tidily wrapped
in tissue in her dressing room.
   The duke's bed has its original velvet cover with his Prince of
Wales insignia and motto, ``Honi soit qui Mal y Pense,'' which
translates, roughly, as ``Shame on him who thinks evil of it.''
   By his bedside sprawls a touching little chimney-sweep rag doll
cherished by the duke, given to him by his mother, Queen Mary, who
publicly disowned him after his indiscreet marriage.
   The duchess's bedroom is a symphony of ``Wallis blue'' and cream
moire silk, with attractive imitation Louis XV and XVI furnishings
and a priceless Venetian l8th century marquetry chest. Visitors
also see a raft of stuffed pug dog dolls and framed needlepoint
works by the duke, who loved needlepoint almost as much as golf,
commemorated in souvenir golf balls all over the place.
   The duchess's bathroom is an artwork in itself, decorated by
Dimitri Bouchene, a Russian artist who designed stage sets for
Diaghilev and Pavlova.
   Under a Napoleonic-style striped silk tent ceiling, the bathroom
walls are covered with Bouchene's floral and animal murals, with a
group of his Christmas cards framed in glass lining the doors like
a gallery exhibition.
   One of the villa's first visitors was the British-born actress
Joan Collins, who asked Al Fayed if he planned to use the house for
his own parties.
   ``I will indeed,'' he said, adding that he plans to keep the
mansion staffed and open to small group visits by special request.
   In 1991, he said, he will send an exhibition of mementoes to
London and other British cities, as well as to New York and to the
duchess's birthplace, Baltimore.

<HEAD>Jewish Group Erects Controversial Menorah in Pittsburgh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish group acting on the strength of a
favorable ruling by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan
erected a 18-foot menorah outside the Pittsburgh City-County
Building on Tuesday night.
   ``This adds some light to the darkness of winter nights and is a
victory for all the people of Pittsburgh,'' said Elliot Katz, an
attorney for the group Chabad.
   The city, which contends it has the right to determine what is
permitted in front of the building, plans to petition the U.S.
Supreme Court on Wednesday morning to have the Hanukkah symbol
taken down.
   Chabad was permitted to erect the display under protection of a
restraining order issued last week by Brennan. In an involved
holiday legal scramble, Brennan upheld U.S. District Judge Barron
P. McCune's order preventing the city from blocking Chabad's
installation of the menorah.
   McCune maintains that the courthouse steps are a public forum
open to all types of expression, and Brennan ruled the menorah
could be allowed until a trial on the matter is held in district
court.
   The Supreme Court ruled last summer that the menorah, a
candelabrum associated with Hanukkah, was permitted outside the
building because it was accompanied by secular symbols, a Christmas
tree and a sign promoting liberty.
   McCune aided the erection of the menorah Tuesday by reducing a
$5,000 bond that Chabad would have been required to post to cover
some potential court costs incurred by the city.
   Chabad requested the bond be reduced to $1,000 but, in a
compromise, McCune set the bond at $2,500.

   Young Chinese determined to learn English are
defying police orders and gathering weekly in a local park in a
dramatic display of peaceful disobedience under martial law.
   The mix of soft-spoken office and factory workers and full-time
students, few of whom would dare challenge the government in any
other way, come each Sunday to a hilltop glade in the Purple Bamboo
Park famous for five years as the English Corner.
   There, they awkwardly accost each other and launch into careful
but determined conversation in English. A well-used opening line is
``How long have you studied English?''
   The park put signs up Oct. 28, declaring the corner closed. It
said students were too busy with other studies. But still the
English lovers keep coming.
   They begin arriving shortly before 10 a.m., hovering nearby
until the numbers seem large enough for them to climb the
now-forbidden hill. Then, huddled deep in padded coats and mufflers
and stomping feet for warmth, they mingle cocktail-party style,
chatting in English.
   Two plainclothes police burst upon the gathering one recent
Sunday, grabbing elbows and trying to move the participants along.
``Hey, don't stand around here,'' one yelled. ``Can't you read the
signs? The corner is closed.''
   The crowd of about 60 people moved sluggishly down the hill to a
lakeside, where skaters glided on the frozen surface. Conversation
resumed through cold-stiffened lips.
   ``The police never come back,'' one corner veteran said
confidently. A few minutes later, one of the police gave a
frustrated shout: ``Go away! Go away!''
   There was a pause, then: ``What do you think of Beijing?''
someone asked a visitor politely.
   It is a practiced ritual. ``They come every week,'' according to
a young man who said he was a science student. So does he, although
a bit nervously. ``I learn a lot from other people. I think my
English has improved,'' he said.
   Many of those who frequent the corner study English on their
own, and it is their only opportunity to try out words they've
learned from tapes or books. They consider English their best hope
for going abroad _ to study and perhaps, whispered one man, ``to
stay for freedom.''
   Certain ground rules have prevailed since June, when the army
attacked pro-democracy protesters and he government began an
intense campaign against dissent.
   ``Before we talked about anything we wanted to,'' said the
science student. ``Now we talk about daily life, maybe about our
(work) units, or cooking.''
   ``Laundry,'' chimed in a girl in a pink parka. ``The weather,''
said a man.
   ``But not politics,'' concluded the student.
   Most believe politics is the real reason the corner was ordered
closed. The student said some people used the corner before June to
make speeches about democracy, believing that police _ who
generally lack college educations _ would not understand.
   Foreign reporters also sometimes visited, using the
conversations as one barometer of what young intellectuals were
thinking.
   But almost everything in Communist-ruled China touches on
politics, and it is hard to avoid entirely.
   ``What do you think about the economic crisis in socialist
countries?'' the girl in pink asked.
   ``Crisis?'' queried a factory technician who had somehow
acquired Australian-accented English. ``Do you mean `shizi
lukou'?'' he asked, using the Chinese for crossing or intersection.
   Someone explained, and he was quick to learn the new word. ``I
heard an interesting conversation about the crisis in East
Europe,'' he offered.
   Listeners shivered with excitement at the words ``East Europe.''
   ``Can we talk about international politics?'' asked a tall young
man. ``Is it OK to talk about Romania?''
   ``I was delighted to hear about Romania,'' whispered a man in a
pale blue jacket, referring to the overthrow of hard-line Communist
leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Asked what they thought of Ceausescu, the group giggled
nervously. ``I have an opinion but I cannot tell you,'' said one.
``He was a dictator,'' said someone bolder. ``Autocrat,'' supplied
a third.
   ``Freedom and democracy is the trend in the world, and it makes
me very happy,'' said the technician to general agreement.
   No one spoke of Chinese intellectuals' frustrated hopes for
democratic reform in their own country. Generations of Chinese have
learned to communicate dangerous ideas like that without words of
any language.

   Nicolae Ceausescu reportedly killed
60,000 Romanians during his terrible reign, some sent to
Transylvanian torture chambers so horrible that the dead leader is
being compared to the monsters of myth.
   State media in post-Ceausescu Romania have begun to paint a
horrific portrait of a man who killed with the epic blood lust of
Count Dracula and the cavalier conscience of a real monster: Adolf
Hitler.
   His son, Nicu, was described as a drunk who ran down and killed
two pedestrians with his car and had a special room where he used
to rape women.
   Ceausescu's execution and the new revelations about his 24-year
rule has Romanians careening between revulsion and exultation.
   ``Oh, what wonderful news. The anti-Christ died on Christmas,''
a Bucharest radio announcer said after an announcement that the
former Communist leader and his wife, Elena, were executed.
Christmas carols then filled the air.
   A secret military tribunal in Monday convicted Ceausescu and his
wife of genocide, undermining the economy and attempting to flee
with more than $1 billion stashed in foreign banks.
   Romanian state television Tuesday broadcast a videotape of
Ceausescu and his wife after they were executed by a firing squad,
their bloody bodies slumped in front of a wall.
   In an official announcement, the television said the charge of
genocide covered the deaths of 60,000 people.
   ``This is the moment of truth. We got rid of the monsters who
mutilated our history. Let these tyrants be cursed. Romania's soil
should not accept their bodies,'' anchorman Viorel Popescu said on
TV and national radio. The broadcasts were monitored in Vienna.
   ``The name of Ceausescu should never be pronounced and written
again. It should be replaced with Dracula from Scornicesti,'' an
unidentified painter in the southern Transylvania city of Sibiu
told national radio. Scornicesti is the village where Ceausescu was
born Jan. 26, 1918, into a peasant's family.
   Even when he was alive, the iron-fisted Ceausescu had earned the
nickname of Vampirescu for his harsh rule, an allusion to Count
Dracula's horror tales set in 19th century Transylvania by Bram
Stoker.
   The United States and some other nations appeared critical of
the decision to try, convict and execute the Ceausescus so quickly.
   On Monday, a U.S. statement announcing the establishment of
diplomatic relations with Romania said: ``We regret the trial did
not take place in an open and public fashion.''
   But Silviu Brucan, a former Romanian ambassador to Washington
and leading dissident who is on the 37-member revolutionary
governing council, said the reason behind the Ceausescus' rapid
execution was to ``crush any hopes for a lethal coup'' by his hated
secret police, the Securitate.
   ``He was probably executed on Christmas Day to show that a new
hope, the hope of freedom, was born in Romania. Ceausescu was the
anti-Christ,'' an unidentified poet told the radio.
   During the Ceausescu reign, dissent was ruthlessly repressed by
the Securitate, a huge and sinister network of tens of thousands of
people.
   Debt repayment and mismanaged industrialization programs
triggered widespread food and energy shortages and dissidents faced
prison, commitment to mental hospitals, internal exile or house
arrest.
   Laws mandated the reporting of every unauthorized conversation
with a foreigner. Every typewriter had to be registered with the
police and censorship was far tighter than anywhere in the Soviet
bloc.
   Romanian TV monitored in Vienna showed a former ``torture
chamber'' ran by the Securitate in the western Romanian city of
Timisoara, where more then 12,000 protesters, including children
and women, were killed by the security forces when local riots
erupted Dec. 17.
   The revolution actually began in Timisoara two days earlier,
when small protests began eventually blossomed into the nationwide
uprising that toppled Ceausescu on Friday.
   ``It's terrifying what we see in this torture room,'' a
commentator said. ``Calcinated bodies, pieces of hairy scalps,
blood and tortured bodies lying on the floor. The victims were
brought here naked.
   ``How small were Hitler's lackeys. They were genuine angels (by
comparison). These are nightmarish images,'' the unidentified
commentator said.
   Tearful residents looking for missing loved ones congregated at
freshly unearthed mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of
summarily executed people, some mutilated.
   One gruesome picture showed the body of an unborn baby whose
mother had been cut open by a bayonet.
   The army and revolutionaries who ransacked the Communist Party
office of Ceausescu's youngest son, Nicu, in Sibiu, southern
Transylvania, found hundreds of Kent cigarette packs and bottles of
whiskey and ``tuica,'' Romanian plum brandy.
   The television showed a back room where, according to the
commentator, Nicu, party chief of the Sibiu county, ``used to rape
women.'' Also displayed were stockings, makeup and underwear of his
purported victims.
   Nicu, 39, was known as a womanizer, heavy drinker and a fan of
Western fast cars who killed at least two people in traffic
accidents, Romanian officials said. He was arrested Dec. 22.
   ``Hitler had more dignity,'' the radio and TV commentator said.
   Romanian TV also showed pictures of the apartment of Ceausescu's
daughter, Zoia-Elena, where she was arrested.
   Among the items displayed were seven expensive watches, jewelry,
$95,000 in cash, valuable paintings taken from Romanian art museums
and pearls ``which we don't think are false.''
   ``Such a `modest' baggage for such a long trip (to jail),'' the
commentator said sarcastically.
   The TV also showed meat supposedly shipped in from Vienna for
her dogs.
   The media reported that Zoia, trained as a mathematician, asked
officers before being taken away by arresting officers: ``Is there
enough room for my two pets?''

   The television station that once
beamed the glory of Nicolae Ceausescu to a numbed nation has become
not only the voice, but the soul of the revolution that toppled his
government and ended his life.
   While everything it broadcast once was suspect, nothing now is
believed until it appears on Free Romania Television, as the
station is calling itself. Although he was reported captured and
executed, it wasn't until television showed Ceausescu in captivity
that the nation sighed in relief.
   The station first broke from the propaganda of the Stalinist
past on Friday morning, when army units joined protesters to drive
Ceausescu from his palace and from power.
   ``We've won. We've won,'' poet Murica Dinescu suddently shouted
into the camera. But those giddy opening moments only were a
prelude to the battles with Ceausescu loyalists that followed.
   The National Salvation Committee clung to the television like a
mantle of power, running the country from a barricaded studio while
Ceausescu's fanatical guard tried to blast it into silence. Sniper
fire smashed windows and heavy shells blew holes in the walls.
   Early Saturday morning, news editor Victor Ionescu announced on
the air: ``We are under attack.'' He urged people to rally outside
the TV station in a masive human shield to protect the building.
Almost immediately, a crowd formed.
   People chanted, ``Freedom! Freedom!'' until gunfire broke out.
Each time, they scattered and regrouped. They shouted, ``We won't
go,'' and they didn't. Outgunned, the attackers pulled back.
   Later that weekend, Ceausescu's guard struck again. Infiltrators
stabbed people in the hallways of the 13-story complex, reportedly
killing three people. For a few hours, TV screens went mysteriously
blank.
   But the interruption was merely a technical problem, it was
explained. Romania was still governed from a hectic studio littered
with empty bottles, cracked coffee mugs and half-eaten sandwiches
and run by people who had not slept in days.
   Television has played a large role in the forces of reform that
swept the East bloc this year. Mass demonstrations were shown live
on TV in Czechoslovakia in the days preceding the Communist
leadership's downfall; East Germans able to watch West German
broadcasts followed closely news of the loosening of travel
restrictions and the rallies that brought down Erich Honecker; a
Solidarity economic minister goes on the air with regular
``fireside chats'' to the people.
   Free Romania Television has become a chaotic reflection of the
country it covers, a jumbled but jubilant mirror of the revolution
it helped orchestrate.
   ``It is madness here, madness,'' said Gratiela Ripeanu. Her
external relations job used to consist mainly of shaking hands with
fraternal Bulgarians.
   Suddenly, she was shepherding countless foreign TV crews all
desperate to relay film back home. Reporters counted on her to find
them National Salvation Committee members to interview.
   One by one, she steered people and their bulky gear through an
obstacle course of gun barrels, locked gates, roiling crowds and
skittish guards who looked for explosives in balpoint pen refills.
Six body searches separated the street from the studio.
   ``We don't know what we are doing anymore, but we're doing it,''
she said.
   Elena Maria Ionescu, a news writer and Victor's wife, helped out
on the studio, partly because her office was a gaping hole in the
eighth floor.
   She smiled broadly when she recognized several reporters who had
sat with her until morning during the first assault.
   They had subsequently stayed in the relative luxury of hotel
rooms, but she was still on the job.
   ``I've slept here, ate here, washed things out here,'' she said.
``My husband is so hoarse he can hardly talk on the air.''
Nevertheless, she seemed ready for another four days.
   Most of the station's 1,300 employees were caught up in the mad
metamorphosis.
   Until the revolution, the station broadcast only two hours
daily, a deadening litany of the heroic and generous qualities of
Ceausescu. Romania's austerity budget left it short of equipment
and supplies.
   Suddenly, it was on the air around the clock, and Romanians who
once scorned television sat glued to their screens.
   Technicians cannibalized old gear and pushed technical
tolerances to the limit.
   Armed soldiers wandered across the set, and overtired officials
reverted to the hated Communist term for comrade, ``Tovarase,''
rather than ``Domnul,'' or mister, but the show went on.
   During the assault, section chiefs and janitors alike beamed
with pride at the unflickering image they broadcast across the
fearful nation. In the face of rumors and threats, the reassuring
voices on television maintained the momentum of the revolt.
   Unlikely heroes emerged in the heat of battle. Marin Constantin,
who edited youth programs, took it upon himself to make sure the
eighth floor occupants made it through the night.
   When the shooting started, he herded eveyone into a central
hallway protected from ricochets by a double layer of walls. When
he found no other way to extinguish the grilled ceiling light, he
deftly smashed it with a chair.
   When the heavy fighting began, his grin broadened, comforting
others whose thoughts were beginning to rattle them. To amuse the
company, he sang an old national hymn that was almost forgotten
during Ceausescu's reign.
   It went, ``Wake up, Romania, from the mortal sleep into which
you have been lulled by the evil tyrant.''
   The song, broadcast earlier in the day over the battered
transmitters, seemed to fit Free Romania Television.

   One of the near-victims of the Romanian revolt

hellish situation in Romania and his brush with death.

   The uprising against dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu gave rise to fierce resistance by his secret
police, turning Romania into a land of fear, suspicion and
retribution. I know, I became a victim of that chaos Saturday night.
   I was shot three times, narrowly escaping death. One bullet
grazed my skull, and two more lodged in my left arm.
   Thanks to some dedicated doctors in District Hospital No. 1 in
Timisoara, and the friendly intervention of Yugoslav diplomats in
the city, I survived and was evacuated within two days to
Yugoslavia's capital Belgrade.
   It is hard to describe the mood of pure panic and paranoia that
pervaded Timisoara, a petrochemical center in western Romania with
about 350,000 inhabitants.
   The events that led to Ceausescu's fall and execution began a
week before Christmas. Demonstrations to prevent a Protestant
minister from being evicted swelled into anti-government protests.
Unarmed civilians were gunned down by state security troops, the
dreaded Securitate, in the main square.
   No Westerner has been able to verify the number of fatalities,
but doctors with whom I spoke said more than 4,000 died. After the
slaughter, the bodies were gathered in trucks and taken to a mass
grave at the city cemetery.
   The blood that flowed that day on the square sparked a popular
thirst for revenge.
   Residents responded with a general strike, and the army declared
itself with the people and against Ceausescu.
   After state TV in Bucharest fell to the opposition Friday, the
borders opened for the first time in four days to Western
journalists.
   I flew to Belgrade from Warsaw late Friday, rented a car at the
airport, and started driving to Romania's border.
   Just before entering Romania, I met a Yugoslav journalist, Ljuba
Pajic, who was to be my companion in the days that followed.
   Although I arrived at the border with no visa, the slightly
drunken border guards wearing armbands in the national colors of
red, blue and yellow let me in with little formality.
   ``American? You are with us,'' one guard whispered out of
earshot of his superior.
   On the two-hour drive to Timisoara, we were repeatedly stopped
by groups of peasants waving the Romanian flag _ with the Communist
emblem cut out of it.
   ``Ceausescu kaput! Ceausescu finito!'' they shouted to the
foreigners.
   But once entering Timisoara, tension replaced jubilation. A
siren wailed and young people on the street talked fearfully of an
air raid.
   Ceausescu's forces were going to bomb the city, they claimed.
   So, with car lights off, fearing the bombs that never fell and
avoiding the black silhouettes of tanks at many street corners, we
began to look for the main hotel, where I thought we would find
other journalists.
   Ljuba and I ended up at the Hotel Timisoara, near the Opera
Square.
   Inside the darkened lobby, we were frisked by nervous young
people carrying knives, clubs and sharpened sticks.
   A young woman who spoke English gave me an account of the
massacre:
   Children peacefully praying the previous Sunday, Dec. 17, were
mowed down by automatic weapons, she said. When their mothers ran
to them, they too were shot.
   It was also in the lobby, less than an hour after arriving in
town, that I met my first casualty.
   French photographer Jean Langevant hobbled in holding his
buddy's arm, a bullet hole in his leg.
   He was bleeding badly, but the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire growing
nearer outside made everyone reluctant to go for help.
   Finally, a ``machina'' _ a car _ rolled up to the front door and
Langevant was bundled inside. Ljuba and I decided to follow in our
car.
   Headlights still off, we raced through the deserted streets,
afraid to stop. We screeched into the courtyard of District
Hospital No. 2.
   The photographer was taken to the operating room and we spent
the night huddled in the doctors' lounge.
   The hospital, like the other buildings in Timisoara at night,
was kept in eerie darkness whenever possible.
   ``They shoot at the light,'' one physician said, drawing a
curtain closed when the flicker of a television set dimly lighted
the lounge.
   Doctors said they had been working with a constant stream of
shooting victims since Dec. 17. They too were afraid, cowering on
the floor when the noise of gunfire came too close. Red tracers
arched over the hospital roof.
   It was a hairy night, but at last, by midmorning Saturday, the
shooting had died down enough to go outside.
   Saturday we spent trying to locate an outside phone line to tell
the story.
   In the evening, I returned to Hotel Timisoara, where we talked
to the leader of the pro-democracy forces, headquartered there.
   Their chief was an automotive engineer, a tall and dignified
young man dressed in a black beret and trenchcoat who spoke some
French.
   The hotel was again in total blackness and he led us through the
empty restaurant to a small cafe off the kitchen, where he pushed
together two tables and fed us a Romanian feast _ sliced sausages
and salty cheese, washed down with grapefruit soda. A Romanian
soldier with a Soviet submachine gun and several rebels looked on
politely.
   I asked them what kind of country they wanted. Democracy and
free elections was the reply. And the Ceausescus? Killing was too
good for them, the group agreed. Maybe torture.
   After a short drive around downtown, where the fighting had been
the heaviest, all appeared quiet. I made one outside phone call and
left the building,
   Outside, the scene had suddenly changed. Gunfire erupted very
close by as soon as we left. Retreating to the car, we backed away
in the opposite direction. Two Italian journalists who had left the
consulate with us followed in another car.
   What followed was a nightmare of running with nowhere to hide.
Every turn in the strange city seemed to lead to another firefight.
We tried to make our way back to the hotel, going in ever wider
circles because of the fighting.
   Finally, luck ran out. Driving into an intersection, somebody
flashed a light on us and shouted in Romanian.
   Before we could answer or get out of the car, I saw the flash of
a gun and realized in an instant they were shooting at us.
   Immediately, I felt something slam into my arm and what felt
like warm water being poured on my head. My own blood.

   For what seemed like an eternity, we screamed that we were
journalists.
   The men who came out of a bunker to us _ some in uniform, some
in civilian clothes _ screamed at us and dragged us to them.
   We were roughed up. One man came at me with a knife but stopped
just before stabbing me. A soldier kept a gun aimed at my head. I
thought they were going to kill us.
   My companion, Ljuba, was not hit by the gunfire, but he was
beaten. They took our money.
   Of the Italians, one was badly wounded in the chest, and the
other unhurt.
   Finally, to my relief, two ambulances arrived. The Italian
photographer, Pasquale Modita, went first. Then me.
   The ride to the hospital was mercifully brief, and for my second
night in Romania, I was once again under the physicians' protection.
   The bullets had gone into my upper left arm, a few inches from
my heart. The other one cut a gash in my scalp, but did not
penetrate my skull.
   ``You were very, very lucky,'' my favorite doctor told me. Time
and again, the doctor said after my first operation to explore the
wound in my arm, ``Someone as lucky as you will live a long time.''
   For the two nights and a day that I convalesced in the hospital,
battle raged outside my window between the Romanian army and small,
ruthless commando units loyal to Ceasescu.
   I worried that the Securitate would win and murder us all.
   But Christmas Day, about 36 hours after being shot, ambulances
arranged by the Yugoslav government and The AP took me and Zzeljko
Ssajan, a wounded reporter from Zagreb television, to Belgrade.
   I was never so happy to cross a border.

   Flooding in Brazil's normally dry
east-central region has killed 24 people and left at least 140,000
homeless, national civil defense spokesman Silvio Reiner says.
   Speaking by telephone on Tuesday from Brasilia, the capital, 750
miles northwest of Rio, Reiner said 140 cities and towns in five of
the 26 states were affected by flooding, caused by more than two
weeks of torrential rain.
   Unofficial reports said most of those killed drowned or were
buried when houses collapsed.
   Reiner said the worst hit area was northeastern Bahia state,
where 105,000 people were driven from their homes.
   Road traffic between Cachoeira, 930 miles northeast of Rio, and
the rest of the country was cut off by the Paraguacu River, which
overflowed and covered much of the city.
   TV film showed canoes and rowboats paddling down flooded streets
with families carrying sofas, stoves and other household goods to
dry ground.
   The city dates from the Portuguese colonial era and is
considered a national historic monument.
   Cachoeira was without electricity and was running out of food
and drinking water, Reiner said. Civil defense workers were flying
in emergency shipments of food, blankets and medicine, mainly
antityphoid and snakebite serum, he said.
   In Minas Gerais state, south of Bahia, 5,765 houses collapsed in
70 townships, the official said, and 24,200 people were homeless.
   About 11,000 Brazilians had to abandon their homes in nearby
Goias, Tocantins and Maranhao states, he said.
   More rain for the region was forecast.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is gone,
but the question of fashioning a security force to replace his
bully boys is causing friction between the U.S. military and the
new Panamanian civilian government.
   Sources on both sides agree there's a problem.
   The civilians want a weakened army that would be little more
than a police force and would not represent a threat to the
government. The United States is pressing for a professional army
to provide security for the Panama Canal.
   Panamanian civilians have been intimidated by the military for
more than 20 years, suffering exile, torture, imprisonment and
death. The Panamanian military has not had much respect for
politicians, whom they considered weak and beholden to the United
States.
   ``The truth is that both, the civilian and the military must be
re-educated,'' a U.S. military source told The Associated Press.
   ``We are telling the Panamanian military that they must
understand their role in society under civilian power. And we are
telling the civilians that a strong military organization is needed
too,'' the source said, on condition of anonymity.
   The Panama Canal is due to be turned over to Panama on Dec. 31,
1999, and U.S. bases are to be closed unless a further agreement is
reached with the Panamanian government. Since the treaties give the
two countries joint responsibiilty for canal security even after
2000, U.S. sources say at least two bases probably will be
maintained, rather than the 10 major installations that now support
12,000 troops.
   Ironically, the Panamanian army under Omar Torrijos was the core
of the long drive to eliminate the sovereign U.S. enclave in the
Canal Zone and negotiate the 1977 treaties. U.S. officials insist
the United States will honor the treaties.
   The dispute over how to reconstitute the Panamanian forces is
taking place even as U.S. officers work with Panamanian officers to
do exactly that, despite civilian unease.
   ``It is a matter of concern that the members of the Defense
Forces are being reintegrated, and not by the Panamanian
government, but by the American Army,'' said Juan Materno Vasquez,
a lawyer who helped negotiate the 1977 canal treaties but left the
government in a dispute with Noriega.
   Vice president and minister of government Ricardo Arias Calderon
has spoken of a Public Security Force, avoiding all reference to
the old name of Defense Forces or previous names, such as National
Guard.
   ``You can call it what you will,'' a U.S. source said. ``It has
to be a professional force, army, national guard or whatever.''
   U.S. military leaders here, who worked with the Panamanians for
years and know them well, feel some _ especially those jailed by
Noriega following coup attempts _ can be trusted enough to form the
core of an army.
   Before the U.S. attack that toppled Noriega Dec. 20, U.S.
military sources told the AP that U.S. forces could ``work with
some of the Panamanian top officers, even if they are not shining
examples of democracy.''
   According to a Panamanian military source, U.S. officers were
rather blunt when they told President Guillermo Endara what they
want in a Panamanian army. Endara was elected president May 7, but
Noriega nullified the vote and Endara was not installed until after
the U.S. assault.
   ``The politicians did not shed any blood,'' another source said.
``The blood was shed by the Americans and the few Defense Forces
units that fought.''
   Both the U.S. and Panamanian military, even those opposed to
Noriega, feel the opposition was unwilling to take risks to try to
topple Noriega. Comparisons with uprisings in South Korea, China
and, lately, Eastern Europe were raised frequently.
   ``They want us to do the job for them,'' a top-ranking U.S.
officer told the AP before U.S. forces did exactly that.
   Some of the new leaders of the future Panamanian military are
the majors and captains who were arrested March 16, 1988, after
their failed coup against Noriega.
   They include men like Maj. Santiago Fundora and Maj. Aristides
Valdonedo, who have been named directors of logistics and public
security respectively, and Maj. August Villalaz, who will be in
charge of the Air Force.
   They have been working closely with the commander of U.S. Army
South, Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, and other Army officers at Fort
Clayton, near Panama City.
   ``The person who is really governing in Panama now is Marc
Cisneros,'' Vasquez said.
   Vasquez said he saw a former lieutenant colonel surrender with
other officers and return home with a ``passport from Cisneros, not
even from Panamanian authorities.''
   ``We're concerned about too many of those guys coming back in,''
said a Christian Democratic politician involved in forming the new
government. The Endara government would like to set up ``something
like what Costa Rica has.''
   Costa Rica, just north of Panama, has been spared coups and
military rule in large measure because the armed forces were
dissolved more than 40 years ago. Costa Rica has only a civilian
police force and relies on the Organization of American States
charter, which calls for collective defense in case of attack.
   In essence that means relying on the United States, but U.S.
officials are not sympathetic to the civilian government's desires.
   ``Endara may feel that he was elected in May,'' one source said
``but his majority meant nothing and he is where he is because of
the American guns.''

   Columnist Art Buchwald came up with an
original idea when he proposed a movie based on the comic
adventures of an African king in America, says the co-creator of
the old TV series ``Barney Miller.''
   Buchwald is suing Paramount Pictures Corp. for $5 million,
alleging the 1988 Eddie Murphy hit ``Coming to America'' was based
on an idea he optioned to the studio in 1983.
   Paramount's attorney, Robert Draper, has contended that Buchwald
failed to live up to his contract with Paramount because his idea
was not original _ that it was based on a Charlie Chaplin movie
called ``A King in New York.''
   But ``Barney Miller'' co-creator Danny Arnold disagreed. ``I
cannot remember a particular work or motion picture about an
African king transposed into a situation in America,'' he testified
Tuesday in the Superior Court trial.
   The Chaplin movie was about a European king who is kicked out of
his own country and tries to sell atomic energy ideas to U.S.
officials.
   Arnold, called as an expert witness for Buchwald, also testified
that the elusive show business term ``based upon'' refers to the
beginning of an idea. But under cross-examination, he said: ``There
is no industry standard for `based upon.' It's a purely subjective
determination.''

   Actor Willem Dafoe said he was
attracted to the role in the new film ``Triumph of the Spirit'' in
much the way he was drawn to his roles in ``Platoon'' and ``The
Last Temptation of Christ.''
   ``They're so unusual,'' said Dafoe, who is picky about parts he
will play. ``They're so huge. They raise so many interesting
questions that you don't quite know what it is before you start
working on it.''
   Dafoe, whose acting career took off two years ago after the
movie ``Platoon,'' is back in the spotlight again with his new film.
   In ``Triumph of the Spirit,'' Dafoe portrays a boxer who fights
for his survival after he is imprisoned at a Nazi death camp with
his family. The critically acclaimed film is based on the life of
Salamo Arouch, a Greek Jew and middleweight boxing champion who was
sent to Auschwitz.
   ``I think I'm attracted to roles that are kind of mythic and
have some size and, you know, are full of possibility,'' he said of
his penchant for playing unforgettable screen characters.

   U.S. Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery said
he was thankful for the chance to dine with the first family on
Christmas Day at Camp David and didn't even mind being put on the

   ``It was a good Christmas,'' said Montgomery, a Democrat. ``I

   Along with the traditional meal of turkey and dressing, sweet
potatoes topped with marshmallows and green beans, Montgomery said
guests were given the choice of pumpkin or pecan pie for dessert.
   ``The meal was terrific, the entire day was very well done.
Everyone was definitely in the Christmas spirit,'' he said Tuesday.

   Civil rights leader Hosea Williams, who has
organized a Christmas dinner for the homeless and hungry for 19
years, is hospitalized with bronchitis and pneumonia, but plans to
get back into action soon.
   ``I'm feeling much better, and I hope to be release in a few
days,'' Williams said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his
room at Emory Hospital.
   Williams, 64, said his annual Christmas and Thanksgiving feasts
since 1970 combined have fed nearly half a million people at a cost
of nearly $1 million, and used 65,000 volunteers.
   ``This was our 19th year, and I'd say we fed a total of about
35,000 at the Christmas dinner, counting the deliveries to sick and
old people at their homes,'' he said. ``You watch these families
eating, and you realize, if they didn't eat here, where would they
eat? They'd just go to bed hungry.''
   Williams said the program has expanded so much that he is going
to turn it into a year-round operation.
   ``I've a job, a real obligation to feed the hungry _ they're the
fastest growing population in Atlanta, even more so than the
homeless. A lot of people have homes, they live here, but they have
nothing to eat,'' said Williams.

<HEAD>Singh Government Halts Future Contracts With Swedish Firm Bofors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh says it will temporarily stop buying weapons from a
Swedish armaments firm accused of paying huge bribes to secure a
1986 contract with the Indian army.
   The alleged impropriety in AB Bofors' $1.4 billion Howitzer gun
deal was a key campaign issue for Singh, whose centrist coalition
ousted Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress Party from power in last
month's elections.
   Singh, who is also the country's defense minister, announced in
Parliament on Tuesday that Bofors will be barred from future
contracts until ``they satisfy us in their conduct in regard to
(the) Howitzer guns.''
   At least two newspaper investigations have sought to prove that
Bofors paid as much as $50 million in bribes and commissions to yet
unnamed persons.
   The allegations have not been proved since they surfaced in
April 1987, but one newspaper, The Hindu, has published purported
documents that it said established Gandhi's links with recipients
of the alleged bribes and commissions.
   The Hindu, and another newspaper, Indian Express, said senior
officials in Gandhi's cabinet and persons close to him received the
bribes. Gandhi has also been accused of covering up the
investigation by handing it over to pliant officers.
   Gandhi has denied the charges and maintained that his actions
have been above board.
   Singh's National Front coalition government said in its election
manifesto that it will unearth and disclose the names of the
commission recipients within 15 days of taking office. Singh was
sworn in Dec. 2.
   On Tuesday, Singh denied that he is not longer keen on probing
the Bofors deal now that his coalition is power.
   Singh said the government order Tuesday covers ``supply of names
of recipients and return of money paid in regard to Bofors gun
transactions.''
   ``This shows there is no lack of enthusiasm. We are determined.
There is no question of compromise on anything.
   ``We will do everything to get the names and come to the
truth,'' Singh said. His colleagues in Parliament loudly thumped
desks.
   Singh was interrupted by Gandhi's Congress Party members when he
continued with the statement. House chairman Shankar Dayal Sharma
adjourned the session amid the uproar triggered by angry shouts
from Singh's colleagues.
   Hours after Singh's truncated statement, the Defense Ministry
said it had been directed by the prime minister to stop all future
contracts with Bofors.
   It was the new government's first major policy decision on the
Bofors deal since taking office.
   ``The embargo will be till such time as the company satisfied
the government of India about their previous conduct,'' the Defense
Ministry said in a statement.
   The current Howitzer gun deal apparently remained unaffected by
the decision as neither Singh nor the Defense Ministry referred to
it.

   A Jewish group erected a 40-foot menorah

   The Orthodox Jewish Chabad group was permitted to erect the

   Brennan upheld U.S. District Judge Barron P. McCune's order

   Anti-aircraft batteries opened fire
late Tuesday at two unidentified aircraft that flew low over the
capital, the government radio station Voice of Nicaragua reported.
   The radio broadcast said the control tower at the Augusto Cesar
Sandino International Airport unsuccessfully tried to establish
radio contact with the aircraft as they approached Managua from the
north and the east before the batteries opened fire at about 9:30
p.m.
   The aircraft escaped, but the incident panicked residents of
neighborhoods close to the airport as firing continued for several
minutes and anti-aircraft tracers blew across the sky.
   The Sandinista government has placed the army on ``maximum
alert'' since U.S. troops invaded Panama one week ago to oust Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry said it was continuing
efforts to arrange the evacuation of 156 Nicaraguan nationals from
Panama. Most of the Nicaraguans were businesspeople, the ministry
said.
   The government also sought to remove two aircraft operated by
the national airline Aeronica that have been trapped at Panama
City's Omar Torrijos airport since the invasion began.

<HEAD>SEC Creates New Fraud Unit to Protect Small Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission,
catapulted into the headlines by its pursuit of multimillion-dollar
insider trading scandals, is putting out the word that it intends
to be just as aggressive in protecting small investors.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden is creating a new fraud unit at the
SEC designed to police the sale of securities by savings and loan
institutions.
   Investigators have charged that some small investors lost their
life savings when they bought securities sold by S&amp;L branches in
the mistaken belief that their investments were protected by
federal deposit insurance.
   ``We intend to see to it that when people are sold securities,
they are provided all the necessary information,'' Breeden said.
   Breeden also announced Tuesday that he had selected William R.
McLucas, a 12-year SEC veteran, to be the new director of
enforcement at the SEC. He will succeed Gary Lynch, who resigned in
July after supervising such landmark insider trading cases as the
investigation of Ivan Boesky and the Wall Street firm of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Both Breeden and McLucas stressed that insider trading still
would be a top SEC priority, but they also indicated that the SEC,
with a 20 percent increase in its budget, would devote more
resources to more low-profile crooks.
   ``Where there is an abuse of a customer's trust, those are the
kinds of cases where we are going to make sure we have an impact,''
McLucas said at a news conference where his selection was announced.
   Individual investors have been leaving the market in droves in
recent years, scared off in part by extreme trading volatility.
Many officials believe the SEC must return to its primary mission
of bolstering confidence in financial markets through protection of
the small investor.
   Breeden, who was picked for the SEC post by President Bush last
summer, said both the administration and Congress had expressed a
strong desire to crack down on abuses against individual investors.
Breeden noted that Congress approved a 20 percent increase in the
SEC budget this year, enough to allow the agency to hire 100 more
attorneys.
   Part of the increased staffing will be used, Breeden said, to
create a special 25-attorney unit to investigate overly aggressive
sales of securities by savings and loans and other financial
institutions.
   Such sales became a major focus of congressional hearings into
the activities at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, the Irvine,
Calif.-based S&amp;L whose failure is expected to end up costing
taxpayers a record $2 billion.
   Small investors told congressional investigators they were lured
into purchasing bonds in Lincoln Savings' parent company, American
Continental Corp., in the mistaken belief that their money was
protected by federal deposit insurance.
   When American Continental, which is headed by Arizona
businessman Charles H. Keating Jr., filed for protection under the
bankruptcy law, it left some 22,000 small investors who had
purchased nearly $200 million in corporate bonds in the lurch.
   Breeden said the new SEC unit will try to prevent financially
ailing S&amp;Ls from turning to fraudulent practices in a desperate
effort to raise cash.
   McLucas, 39, joined the SEC in 1977, two years after receiving a
law degree from Temple University.
   Lynch, who resigned to join a New York law firm, served for four
years as SEC enforcement chief, taking over from John Fedders, who
was forced to resign after allegations surfaced that he had beaten
his wife.
   Lynch was credited with restoring morale at the SEC and
directing some of the agency's biggest investigations, beginning
with the exposure of Dennis Levine in May 1986. Levine's
cooperation led to a $100 million settlement with speculator Ivan
Boesky. Boesky in turn implicated Drexel Burnham, which led to a
$650 million settlement with the securities firm, the largest
securities fraud case ever brought by the government.
   Civil and criminal charges are still pending against former
Drexel junk bond pioneer Michael Milken.

   U.S. presidents since Teddy Roosevelt in 1903
have talked about the need to install democracy in Panama. Some
sent troops under the banner of shoring up democratic rule.
   But all have been stymied by the lack of democratic tradition in
the strategically placed isthmus and by their overriding desire to
protect U.S. rights of passage through the Panama Canal, scholars
say.
   When President Bush went on television Wednesday morning to
explain why he dispatched troops to remove Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega from power, he cited the Panamanian people's
desire for democracy and peace. ``The people of the United States
seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals,'' he
said.
   ``The rhetoric about favoring democracy is no more than that.
It's a pretense,'' said John Peeler, who heads the Center for the
Study of the Americas at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania.
   The real U.S. desire is ``for democratic government, read
reliable government, one that won't threaten our control of the
canal,'' Peeler added.
   The few times in their 86-year history of independence when
Panamanians have supported a truly democratic government, ``We
weren't willing to accept their choice,'' Peeler said.
   That includes Arnulfo Arias, a populist leader elected president
twice in the 1940s and again in 1968. Arias' left-leaning views did
not sit well with the United States, which was not sorry to see him
ousted after several days in office by National Guard commander
Gen. Omar Torrijos.
   But Torrijos proved an even bigger problem for the
administration, with his pro-Cuban policies and strong nationalism
which opposed the U.S. right under the 1903 treaty to use the canal
``in perpetuity.''
   Increasing friction with the United States led to the
ratification of a new treaty in 1978 ceding the canal to Panama in
the year 2000 but reserving the right to intervene if shipping
through the waterway were threatened.
   Threats to U.S. use of the canal were what prompted the first
dispatch of military force to Panama. When Colombia, which ruled
Panama in the 19th Century, refused to approve the 1903 canal
treaty with the United States, Roosevelt sent warships to help the
growing Panamanian secessionist movement.
   But the warships only stood by as the secessionists launched a
bloodless revolt and declared independence.
   In August 1914, the same month World War I broke out, the first
ships passed through the canal. But political chaos reigned and the
United States sent troops to register voters and supervise
elections.
   Each time that happened _ in 1908, 1912 and 1916 _ the losing
side blamed U.S. interference.
   By the 1930s, ``there was growing U.S. frustration with the
attempts to instill democracy in Panama,'' said Frank Gerome, a
professor of history at James Madison University in Virginia.
Gerome has written extensively about U.S. efforts to organize the
1912 elections.
   Panama's strategic importance grew immensely in World War II,
when the U.S. military presence rose sharply to defend oil
shipments from Venezuela to the United States against German
interception. The hitherto limited U.S. military presence, which
had been centered mostly around the canal, spread to other parts of
the country.
   Panama in the 1950s and 1960s was ruled by a succession of
families from among a thin elite. While not a military state,
neither was it truly democratic.
   Torrijos' rise to power in 1968 transferred power to the
military, with a nominal role for civilian governments. Such was
the setup under Noriega, too, after Torrijos died in a 1981 plane
crash.
   ``Various American presidents hoped the roots of democracy might
grow,'' said Gerome. ``What they failed to understand is that you
can't export democracy.''
   Noriega, abhorrent though he is now to the U.S. administration
which nurtured him in the 1970s, enjoyed strong popular appeal
among Panama's poor.
   Guillermo Endara, who was installed at a U.S. military facility
as Panama's president on Thursday based on the results of last
May's elections, does not enjoy Noriega's popular appeal. His main
support comes from middle-class merchants.
   ``Support for him is weak, not passionate,'' and being propped
up by the United States can only be a liability, said Peeler,
adding, ``People aren't celebrating democracy, they're looting.
Doesn't Bush see that?''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Quail Hunting a Tradition for President Busyh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is winding up his first year as
president pretty much the same way he ended the year before, and
the year before that, going back several decades: quail hunting on
a Texas ranch.
   Bush aides say they hope he'll have better luck than last year,
when dry conditions made the tiny game birds scarce.
   The president will spend several days isolated _ but never out
of touch, aides insist _ at the 10,000-acre Lazy F Ranch near
Beeville in South Texas, owned by his friend, Houston millionaire
Will Farish.
   ``It's been a tradition for the past 20 years,'' said aide
Stephen Hart, who worked for Bush as vice president and has been
along on several of the previous quail-hunting trips.
   ``They drive around the ranch in big specially designed trucks,
then hunt with dogs. If they can catch turkey, too, then that's a
big treat,'' Hart said.
   In the past, Bush has hunted quail with a 20-gauge shotgun,
dressed in snake-resistant chaps, heavy leather boots and an orange
hunting cap.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, expected to be along on
the trip, is known to prefer turkey hunting, which requires greater
patience.
   But Bush, who likes to jump from event to event, has defended
the sport of quail hunting as more to his liking _ and has asserted
that the birds are not to be regarded as cute animals but as wily,
determined quarry.
   ``These aren't animals _ these are wild quail, '' Bush declared
during last year's trip in a remark that angered animal rights
groups. ``You've got to eat. Our forefathers ate by harvesting
game.''
   The Texas office of The Fund for Animals has written to Bush
asking him to cancel the hunt, and plans to have animal activists
travel to Beeville to protest his activities if he carries out his
hunting plans.
   It seems likely that Bush and Baker will discuss another wily,
determined quarry while on the ranch _ deposed Panamanian dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega's decision to go Sunday to the Vatican embassy in Panama
City, where he is currently in hiding, took a lot pressure off the
Bush administration as it seeks to help restore post-invasion order
in Panama.
   However, aides said Bush never wavered from his determination to
make the hunting trip, and that little _ short of a major crisis _
would force him to cancel the trip.
   The town of Beeville, population about 15,000, is throwing a
barbecue for the president tonight upon his arrival _ but probably
won't see him again. Once he enters the vast ranch, he is not
expected to be seen publicly in the area. He will fly by helicopter
directly to Houston on Friday.
   Meanwhile, the Chamber of Commerce of neighboring Goliad, Texas,
is fussing to the White House that the part of the ranch where Bush
hunts is actually in Goliad, not Beeville _ and that it should be
able to share in the publicity.
   But the sheriff of Goliad County, J.K. McMahan, says it's fine
with him if the president keeps a low profile. Referring to recent
stories that Colombian drug lords may have put a $30 million price
on the president's head, McMahan said recently: ``I don't want him
killed, period, but I damn sure don't want him killed in my
county.''
   Bush also plans to bracket his quail-hunting with two fishing
expeditions _ another endeavor in which the president has not had
much recent luck.
   Bush planned to fish for redfish in the Gulf of Mexico, off
Corpus Christi, today on his way to Beeville.
   And on New Year's Day, after spending several days in Houston,
including a side trip on Sunday to two military hospitals in San
Antonio to visit soldiers wounded in Panama, Bush will take about
five hours out on his return to Washington to fish for bass on a
private lake near Montgomery, Ala.

   The White House says it's glad that Time Magazine selected
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to be ``Man of the Decade'' in
its current year-end issue.
   ``We certainly congratulate him,'' said presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater. ``He has contributed greatly to the changes in
Eastern Europe and reforms in his own country. They have all been
very productive to Western interests. We congratulate him on it.''

<HEAD>Modest Consumer Food Price Rise Expected in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer food prices are still on track to
increase by a modest 3 percent to 5 percent in 1990 despite the
bitter cold that has ravaged citrus and winter vegetable crops,
says an Agriculture Department analyst.
   The food price forecast was made last month, and economist Ralph
Parlett said Tuesday he is sticking by it, at least for now.
   Overall food prices are up an average of about 5.7 percent this
year, the largest annual gain since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981.
Much of this year's increase was due to lingering effects of the
1988 drought and poor weather early in 1989.
   ``I'm not worried about my overall forecast (for 1990) at this
point,'' Parlett said in a telephone interview. ``But there'll be
some impact, and possibly higher prices in the first quarter.''
   Parlett said he and other agency analysts are ``still trying to
assess the damage'' to citrus and vegetable crops in Florida and
elsewhere.
   ``The main thing is oranges,'' he said. ``Vegetables _ tomatoes,
bell peppers, celery _ they're some of the big volume things that
would be coming out of Florida now.''
   Parlett said 90 percent of the Florida oranges are for
processing and that a lot of them can be salvaged for juice. The
main source of ``fresh market'' oranges is California.
   ``There will be some (retail) price impact,'' he said. ``But
since we do have decent supplies in California this year ... the
supply impact will be minimal.''
   With the supply of Florida orange juice reduced by the freezing
weather, Parlett said imports from Brazil will probably rise
sharply.
   ``We've got super supplies in Brazil this year, but the price
has been fairly low because of the higher supplies,'' he said.
``But now that we probably will be importing, that will push the
price up some.''
   Parlett said he had not seen damage reports from Texas, where
state officials have estimated losses of 70 percent of the citrus
and 80 percent of the winter vegetables.
   Vegetable losses are ``a more temporary kind of thing'' because
those crops can be replanted, he said. Growers were just starting
to harvest Florida's main supply of winter vegetables when the cold
weather struck.
   California is still producing vegetables, however, and ``this
time of year we start getting produce out of Mexico, too,'' Parlett
said.
   ``There's no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short,
and we'll probably see higher prices'' at produce counters, he said.
   In his forecast last month, Parlett said 1990 average retail
prices of all fruits and vegetables might rise only 1 percent to 3
percent, compared with the preliminary 7.8 percent gain registered
this year and 7.6 percent in 1988.
   Parlett said the current freeze damage ``might push us to the
high end'' of the 1990 forecast range _ 1 percent to 3 percent _
and, if conditions worsen, could push it even higher.
   ``Oranges themselves aren't going to do much to hurt that range,
and the vegetables will recover later on,'' he said.
   According to USDA computations based on Bureau of Labor
Statistics price information, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables
last year accounted for 11.4 percent of the BLS consumer price
index for food bought in grocery stores, while processed fruits and
vegetables made up only 6.8 percent of the index.
   Meats, by comparison, accounted for 20.3 percent of the BLS
food-at-home price index, while cereals and bakery products
accounted for 14 percent; and dairy products, 12.3 percent.

<HEAD>Bush Domestic Policy Adviser Takes `Honest Broker' Approach</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He is President Bush's top adviser on domestic
issues _ from gun control to clean air _ a veteran of three
presidencies who knows government inside out and is such a
workaholic he sometimes sleeps in his White House office.
   From Roger Porter's arrival at the White House on the same day
Richard Nixon left office in scandal, through every Republican
administration since, he has had a hand in crafting policies that
affect millions of Americans.
   Today as Bush's domestic policy adviser, he is the presidential
assistant who reigns over issues such as child care, the drug war,
education and auto pollution.
   But Porter's is a name little known to most Americans.
   ``He doesn't like to hog attention,'' says White House legal
counsel C. Boyden Gray, adding, ``Don't mistake that for lack of
influence or lack of force.''
   The president typically consults with Porter on a daily basis
for what some describe as Porter's ``honest broker'' approach to
sifting through competing policy options.
   He is Bush's intermediary to interest groups, members of
Congress and government agencies that want to sell their side of a
given issue.
   He also gives speeches on administration policy, with a
methodical style recalling his days as a Rhodes scholar and
professor of government and politics at Harvard and Oxford.
   But his low-key image belies a tough-minded dealer who is
fiercely protective of Bush's interests, associates say.
   ``I found Roger to be cautious. He likes you to verify
everything,'' said Dewey Stokes, head of the Fraternal Order of
Police, who sought Bush's support for a waiting period and
background check for gun purchasers.
   That idea was rejected. And under Porter's guidance, other ideas
for Bush's much-proclaimed ``kinder, gentler'' America have been
muted along the way.
   As the administration point man at the education summit with
Bush and the nation's governors, Porter ensured joint endorsement
of results-oriented education without committing Washington to
specific spending.
   While he led the administration's drive for a new clean air
package that went well beyond President Reagan's stringency, it
didn't quite measure up to the aspirations of environmental groups.
   Perhaps because he tries to give Bush a balanced view of all
viable policy options, Porter is seen by some as a weaker adviser
than might be expected of his position.
   One White House colleague said Porter's effectiveness is
dampened by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu's unquestioned
dominance, making it impossible for Porter to assume a larger role.
   Asked if that is true, Porter says he is ``quite happy to be
part of a collegial effort.''
   ``I don't go out and do things that I'm not going to discuss
with him, but he gives me a lot of latitude,'' he said, referring
to Sununu.
   Porter, who often spends the night in his White House office,
admits to being a workaholic and ``a bit of a perfectionist.''
   ``I have never regretted the extra effort. ... I know I'm not
going to be doing this for the rest of my life,'' he said. ``I view
it as a rare opportunity.''
   His introduction to the White House came Aug. 9, 1974. Arriving
from Harvard to start work as a White House fellow, Porter recalls,
he ran into his new boss, then-Vice President Ford, at the elevator.
   Ford greeted him somewhat distractedly and headed off to his
historic final Oval Office meeting with Nixon, Porter recalled.
   Later that day, a Ford aide assigned Porter to be the secretary
of Ford's transition team. He helped write a report based on
interviews with all the Cabinet members and senior players in
government.
   Under Ford, Porter had a variety of jobs including special
assistant to the president and executive secretary to the Economic
Policy Board. During the Reagan administration he also held several
White House jobs, including director of the Office of Policy
Development.
   Porter me Bush over tennis, a game for which both share a
passion and considerable skill. Ford had just named Bush to be his
CIA director and invited both men to play on the White House courts.
   Porter says he can tell a lot about a person from his tennis
game. About Bush, he said: ``One thing I look for is how they call
the lines ... In all the time I've played with Bush over a 15-year
period, I have never once had occasion to question his line calls.
He is scrupulously honest.''
   Other Bush tennis traits, Porter said, are patience, persistence
and strategy, reflecting a methodical approach in how he approaches
other things as well.

<HEAD>Stealth Fighter Passes its First Combat Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says the Stealth fighter passed
its first combat test during the Panama military intervention by
hitting its targets in a raid on a field outside a Panamanian
military barracks.
   ``The mission was successful,'' spokesman Pete Williams said
Tuesday, telling reporters that the F-117 aircraft's sophisticated
bombs ``precisely hit their targets.''
   Asked whether the F-117's had any other role in the
intervention, the spokesman said, ``No, that was the sole mission.
Others were considered but they were discarded.''
   He declined to say what they were. Williams also declined to say
how many of the airplanes were involved or what kind of bombs they
dropped.
   The Washington Post on Saturday quoted unnamed government
officials as saying they understood the plane was tapped for the
job of bombing hideouts of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega before he
could get away.
   Williams repeated earlier Pentagon statements that the objective
of the Stealth plane was ``not to hit the barracks, but rather, in
fact, the mission was to miss the barracks and hit the field _ and
by nature of the explosion, disorient and stun and confuse and
frighten, frankly,'' the Panamanian soldiers.
   ``I'm told that the F-117 hit it very precisely and that it was
the precision of the F-117's bombing capability that was the reason
it was used,'' he said.
   ``I don't know how much of a factor the stealthiness was,'' he
said.

   When they first dated in 1982, Jack
Elson opened doors for his future wife, Robin, cooked romantic
dinners and lit her cigarettes.
   ``I figured my knight in shining armor had finally come,'' said
Robin Elson, who has an 11th-grade education and was selling Avon
products when she met the 188-pound, 5-foot-8 auto mechanic.
   What he didn't tell her was that he had been married four times,
that one previous wife was hiding from him and another got a
restraining order against him when he beat her for slicing onions
too big.
   They married after a two-month courtship. He showed up 45
minutes late and drunk for the wedding.
   Six months later, when Robin objected to Jack going on a
Saturday fishing trip, he asked his friend to wait outside, went in
the house and blackened both her eyes.
   It was the opening of a brutal reign that left the two children
he and Robin had together, sons Camrin, 4, and Brock 2, and a
daughter from Robin's previous marriage, Renee, 11, living in
terror.
   Robin and the children were not only beaten, but Jack also left
her lists of chores to be completed, limited her nail polish colors
to pale pink and peach, forbade her to wear makeup, told her what
food to buy and checked her change against grocery receipts.
   Last December, Robin picked up a rifle as her husband lay in his
recliner chair after a morning of drinking and beating his family
and their pet dog. The 4-foot-9, 70-pound woman braced herself
against a wall and fired three times, killing him.
   A jury in Long Beach last month acquitted the 28-year-old woman
of murder after hearing a wide range of testimony about a married
life filled with terror and abuse.
   He beat her because the pork chops she cooked were too dry. He
slugged her in the stomach while she was pregnant because she
burned the toast, then apologized with flowers.
   Neighbors said they watched _ horrified but too terrified of
Jack to call police _ as he ordered one pleading child to do 100
push-ups on hot cement and shoved a running garden hose down the
throat of another.
   ``If he told me I was stupid, I believed it. If he told me he
would kill me, I believed it. If he opened the door and said `Go,'
I wouldn't, for fear he'd stab me in the back on my way out,''
Robin said in an interview published in Tuesday's Los Angeles
Times. ``I was a robot.''
   Prosecutors were appalled by the jury's vote, but defense
attorneys hailed the decision, saying jurors are ready to accept
the battered wife defense.
   ``Is this a signal that men who get frustrated by the actions of
their wives can kill them? That whenever we get frustrated with
someone we are entitled to exact the ultimate sentence _ death?''
asked Denis Petty, deputy district attorney.
   The law requires an ``imminent danger'' to justify a killing in
self-defense. Prosecutors insist that was not the case when Robin
shot and killed her husband.
   ``She could have left the state, gone to a neighbor, called the
police. He was asleep when the first shot was fired. He wasn't
posing any threat. And when we start allowing citizens to take
matters into their own hands, we are back to the law of the
jungle,'' Petty said.
   Robin tried twice to escape, and both times Jack found her.
   After the second time he found her, he promised to reform. But
when they returned home, he took away her check-cashing card and
house key, quit his job, and never left the house without one of
the children. He often took the telephone with him.
   ``It's like the scientific experiment where they shocked dogs to
the point that even when the gate was left open, the dogs never
left,'' defense attorney Lynda Vitale said. ``The dogs saw the open
gate not as a means of escape, but an invitation to more
punishment.''
   Neighbors said Jack and his little sister were raised in the
house that he later inherited from his two alcoholic parents. While
they were growing up, Jack and his sister were often thrown against
the wall by their parents, or left alone at night while they went
out for a night of drinking.
   When Jack got big enough, he began beating his mother. Sounds of
violence from the house were common. The sounds continued after
Robin moved in.
   Neighbors reported hearing the children shouting, ``Please,
Daddy, don't.''
   ``I knew what he was like. I tried not to irritate him. I was
scared to death of that man,'' said longtime neighbor Nola De
Martino, 74.
   Robin and her family now live in a two-bedroom apartment in Long
Beach. She has put on 25 pounds and is trying to stop smoking. The
entire family is undergoing extensive therapy, the Times said.
   De Martino can see the Elson house from her kitchen window.
   ``I cry about it and I pray about it,'' she said. ``I even
prayed for Jack that he wouldn't go to hell. But I don't know how
he couldn't.''

<HEAD>Bush Signs Order Implementing Pay Hikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top government salaries will rise by up to 35
percent in the next 13 months, under an executive order signed by
President Bush that carries out the recently enacted pay raise and
ethics bill.
   Also under the plan, all federal workers will receive a 3.6
percent cost-of-living pay increase.
   The order, signed by Bush on Tuesday at the presidential retreat
at Camp David, Md., follows his signature earlier this month on the
pay raise and ethics bill.
   The measure will raise top government salaries by up to 35
percent over the next 13 months, with House salaries jumping from
the current $89,500 to $96,600 in 1990 and more than $120,000 in
1991, plus a cost-of-living adjustment.
   But by then the 435 members of the House will be barred from
accepting honoraria, generally fees for making speeches.
   Senate salaries would climb in 1990 from $89,500 to $98,400. But
senators balked at giving up their honoraria. The new law would not
bar speaking fees for senators, but they also would not get the big
jump in salaries in 1991 that the House gets.
   Senators could keep $26,900 in honoraria compared to $35,800
presently.
   Federal judges and top executive branch officials also would get
an immediate 4.1 percent raise and 3.6 percent, compounded on that,
on Jan. 1, 1990, as a catch-up for two years without a
cost-of-living adjustment.
   House employees and other top federal executive and judicial
officials also would be barred from accepting speech fees beginning
in 1991. Currently, House members are limited to earning speech
fees equivalent to 30 percent of their salary. Senators can make up
to 40 percent, but that will fall with their pay increase to
slightly more than 27 percent.
   Under the pay package, top-level members of the executive
service level, who now earn a maximum of $99,500, would earn up to
$107,300 under the legislation and the executive order signed by
Bush.

   Penny Hollis left New Hampshire last summer
and bought a home in this farm belt town so fast that she didn't
notice the major landmark: a grain elevator.
   ``I thought, `Elevator, what's so special about an elevator?
Isn't that what goes up and down in department stores?''' she
recalled.
   Hoping to save its businesses and its school, Rolfe put out a
national invitation two years ago, offering a free lot and $1,200
cash to anyone who builds a house worth $30,000.
   About 70 people have accepted the invitation, increasing the
population by almost 10 percent. Their 20 children padded school
enrollment to 190.
   Four houses have been built, although none by the transplants,
who are happy to rent or buy existing homes at a fraction of the
price they're used to paying.
   ``We paid $4,500 for it, plus $1,500 for the garage,'' says
Becky Roberts of her century-old, 3,000-square-foot house. ``In
Sacramento, it would probably go for $300,000.''
   To Mrs. Roberts and her husband, Gary, who moved from the
California city this year for their retirement, this town about 80
miles northwest of Des Moines is just what she and her husband were
looking for.
   ``We were thinking about retiring and moving to a small
community and one morning on the boob tube, here comes the story
about Rolfe,'' she said.
   They visited, liked the place and decided to settle.
   ``It's real slow here,'' she said. ``People are genuinely
friendly. If they call on you or visit, it's because they want to.
... You don't have to be suspicious of people at your door.
   ``You go downtown and find cars parked at the curb, running,
with babies in them. In California, you would never leave it
unlocked, let along running with a kid in it. That would be like
stamping the kid on the forehead with, `Take me, I'm available.'''
   For that matter, a car hasn't been stolen in Rolfe in three
years, said City Administrator Dave Jochims.
   Alcides and Guelly Mendoza, who came from Brazil by way of the
Bronx, tired of the rush and risk of the New York City.
   The move was especially good for their four children, three in
school and an 8-month-old, says Mrs. Mendoza. In New York, they
lived in a very good area, ``but four or five blocks over, there
were buildings where there was trouble.''
   ``I like it here because I don't have too much problem for my
kids,'' she said. ``Here many people look after kids. Everybody
takes care of everybody. People here make me feel welcome.''
   Until her husband found a job in nearby Pocahantas, Mrs. Mendoza
received public assistance for the infant. ``But now my husband
found a good job and when I pick up my last check this month, I
tell how much we appreciate but we do not need any more,'' she said.
   Other families aren't so quick to get on their feet.
   Ron Walrod, director of social services for Pocahontas County,
said he knows of about a dozen people receiving public assistance
in Rolfe.
   But Jochims said most of the newcomers are on their own.
   ``I know there are families who need assistance, like a lot of
Iowans. Whether we like it or not, these people are not
disposable,'' he said. ``This is a free society. We're concerned
about the people who come here.''
   The elevator is the main employer in Rolfe, but there are ample
opportunities for skilled workers in nearby communities, Jochims
said. The county unemployment rate is 1.1 percent.
   ``So far, the businesses have been happy with the workers
they've received and I feel good about it. People are moving to
Rolfe to better themselves,'' Jochims said.
   After her husband died of a brain tumor two years ago, Ms.
Hollis, 31, decided she and her four children, ages 3 to 14, needed
to get away from New Hampshire.
   ``I saw this article in a woman's magazine and decided to drive
out,'' she said. ``I couldn't get over the openness. I kept
stopping the car and getting out so I could see how far I could see.
   ``I really didn't check out Rolfe very much, it was the land I
loved. I put a down payment down on this house right away.''
   She said relatives practically dared her to leave, betting that
she wouldn't, and said she's having reservations.
   ``I used to socialize all the time and now I don't know
anybody,'' she said.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Down, Nikkei Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar remained weak against the yen Wednesday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moved to a new high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
257.69 points Tuesday, added another 120.32 points, or 0.31
percent, to close at 38,801.63.
   The dollar closed at 142.10 yen, down 0.27 yen from Tuesday's
close of 142.37 yen. After opening at 142.13 yen, the currency
ranged between 141.85 yen and 142.20 yen.
   Currency dealers described the trading as thin, with fewer
participants due to the holiday season.
   A dealer with Mitsui Bank said there was sporadic buying of
European currencies, especially the West German mark, through
dollar selling, but the buying was not enough to direct the U.S.
currency.
   Some investors sold the dollar to buy yen, but ``the dollar
remained close to its opening,'' said the dealer, who spoke
anonymously.
   Other dealers said many market players expected a further
narrowing of gaps in interest rates between Japan and the United
States.
   On Monday, the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, raised
its official discount rate to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent to
stem inflationary pressure in Japan.
   A higher discount rate, the rate the central bank charges on its
loans to commercial banks, tends to boost the value of the yen
against the dollar.
   The U.S. discount rate is 7 percent.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index continued to gain with
shares being bought on a broad front, encouraged by the yen's
firmness against the dollar, securities dealers said.

<TEXT>
   Chevy Chase's ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation'' was the holiday weekend favorite, grossing $7 million in
ticket sales during the four-day period.
   Christmas and cold weather kept overall movie business down,
according to figures released Tuesday by Exhibitor Relations Inc.
But the year-end box office will still set an all-time record in
excess of $5 billion, Exhibitor Relations said.
   ``Christmas Vacation'' finished ahead of the new adventure movie
``Tango &amp; Cash,'' which pairs Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone
portray as cops who don't always see eye-to-eye. ``Tango &amp; Cash''
collected a cool $6.6 million.
   In third place with $5.5 million was the black comedy ``The War
of the Roses,'' featuring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as
the feuding couple. In fourth was ``Back to the Future Part II,''
with Michael J. Fox, on revenues of $4.1 million.
   ``Always,'' director Steven Spielberg's remake of the 1943 film
``A Guy Named Joe,'' opened in fifth place with $3.7 million. In
sixth was the animated film ``The Little Mermaid,'' which made $3.3
million.
   In seventh was the ensemble tear-jerker ``Steel Magnolias,'' on
$2.6 million. ``Blaze,'' the chronicle of Louisiana Gov. Earl
Long's affair with young stripper Blaze Starr, landed in eighth
with $1.7 million and is the season's biggest flop.
   ``Family Business,'' starring Dustin Hoffman and Sean Connery,
finished ninth with $1.6 million. The baby comedy ``Look Who's
Talking,'' was 10th with $1.5 million.
   Director Oliver Stone's ``Born on the Fourth of July'' opened
strongly in limited release, collecting a per-screen average of
$39,964 for a total take of $172,021. The glib documentary ``Roger
&amp; Me'' made $84,232 for a good debut on four screens nationwide.
   ``The Music Box,'' however, didn't play well, netting just
$19,381 on three screens.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations.
   1. ``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,'' Warner Bros., $7
million weekend gross, 1,950 screens, $3,594 per screen, $44.1
million total gross, four weeks in release.
   2. ``Tango &amp; Cash,'' Warner Bros., $6.6 million, 1,409 screens,
$4,705 per screen, $6.6 million, one week.
   3. ``The War of the Roses,'' 20th Century Fox, $5.5 million,
1,455 screens, $3,793 per screen, $27.5 million, three weeks.
   4. ``Back to the Future Part II,'' Universal, $4.1 million,
2,102 screens, $1,935 per screen, $81.9 million, five weeks.
   5. ``Always,'' Universal, $3.7 million, 1,016 screens, $3,655
per screen, $3.7 million, one week.
   6. ``The Little Mermaid,'' Disney, $3.3 million, 1,513 screens,
$2,194 per screen, $34.1 million, six weeks.
   7. ``Steel Magnolias,'' Tri-Star, $2.6 million, 1,329 screens,
$1,950 per screen, $34.7 million, six weeks.
   8. ``Blaze,'' Disney, $1.7 million, 909 screens, $1,819 per
screen, $4.6 million, two weeks.
   9. ``Family Business,'' Tri-Star, $1.6 million, 1,230 screens,
$1,275 per screen, $4.8 million, two weeks.
   10. ``Look Who's Talking,'' Tri-Star, $1.5 million, 1,365

<TEXT>
   Medical supplies from Florida have been sent to Panama, and food
and clothing are being gathered in Massachusetts to help the
Central American country recover from the U.S. invasion its
resulting civil disorders.
   ``We realize this is just a small amount of what's needed,''
said Luis Endara Jr., a cousin of the new Panamanian president and
head of the group, Help Panama, which sent the $50,000 shipment
Tuesday. ``But at this point anything is a help. These supplies are
urgently needed.''
   The supplies included plasma and antibiotics, syringes and
needles, intravenous solutions and orthopedic devices and were to
be distributed at Panama City's two main hospitals.
   Help Panama's first shipment, mostly donated by several south
Florida hospitals, filled a chartered twin-engine Lear 25 jet.
   Endara said a cargo ship with six 40-foot containers of food is
expected to leave Miami on Friday for the four-day voyage to
Panama, and Help Panama has opened accounts at two Miami banks to
take donations.
   In Quincy, Mass., Mike Preble, a 23-year-old department store
statistician, began a drive to collect food and clothing for
victims of warfare and looting in the Central American country.
   ``I'm not a spokesman for the U.S. government,'' Preble said,
``But we did what we had to do and now it's our responsibility to
clean it up.''
   Preble said he was prompted into action Saturday when he phoned
his cousin, Jane Huff, whose husband, Bill, works as a pilot on the
Panama Canal. They live in Balboa, Panama, with their three
children.
   Mrs. Huff told Preble that a high school soccer stadium in
Balboa was filled with about 3,000 people seeking help at a refugee
center.
   Preble felt he had to do something about that. So he enlisted
the cooperation from the Quincy mayor's and he put out a call
asking donors to bring clothing and non-perishable food to fire
stations. Arrangements could also be made to have volunteers
collect the goods, he said.
   On Tuesday, he didn't know how much was collected, and he was
still trying to arrange for a military cargo plane to deliver the
goods to Panama.
   Panamanian hospitals have suffered in part because Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's regime used medical supply areas to hide arms,
according to Roberto Dominguez, who on Tuesday was named the
Panamanian consul in Miami.
   ``It's going to take a lot more shipments like these to return
the hospitals to where they should be,'' said Dominguez.

   The United Express Jetstream apparently skidded off a runway
while trying to take off from Tri-Cities Airport, about 180 miles
southeast of Seattle, said Robert Mills, airport manager.
   Denise Monk, a Franklin County sheriff's dispatcher, said five
people were killed.
   ``As far as I know, it was everyone on the plane,'' firefighter
Forrest Stewart said of the victims. He said there were no injuries

   At graveside, a yellow bath towel
knotted around a rough pine cross and a spray of white
chrysanthemums scrounged in a city where even bread is scarce were
among tributes to heroes of the revolution.
   A procession of sobbing families Tuesday accompanied makeshift
coffins to a field of 200 freshly dug graves in southern Bucharest.
   One coffin was for 14-year-old Silviu Minca, whose friends said
he was killed when the nation's hated security police called to
them from a window and opened fire when they approached.
   The security police have killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
people in in their armed resistance to the uprising that toppled
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Officials at Belo cemetery believe 300 to 400 people killed in
fighting during the past five days will have to be buried, but
perhaps hundreds more are believed hidden in secret graves dug by
Ceausescu's men before he was overthrown.
   By a pine cross marked ``first hero,'' a veteran gravedigger
named Nicolae Abag wept along with the mourners.
   ``This is so, so much,'' he said. ``I have not cried here since
the earth moved in 1977,'' the year of the earthquake in which
almost 2,000 people were killed.
   At the next grave, people mourned Nicisor Paunoiu, an elevator
mechanic who responded when the radio station appealed for help
because it was attacked by the Securitate, the security police.
   Paunoiu and three friends stormed a Securitate stronghold
unarmed. Three of them were cut down by automatic weapons fire. He
left a son and a daughter who was married three weeks ago.
   Farther down, there was the student Dan Adrian Urucu, who went
to protect the TV station. He joined 3,000 others in a human shield
between harassing Ceausescu loyalists and army men protecting the
13-story TV building. Urucu, 21, was shot in the back.
   ``His death was for all of us, for our freedom,'' student Ileana
Nita said as she stood by Urucu's grave. ``It was a sacrifice we
must appreciate. We have to learn what it means to be free and what
that is worth.''
   Bits of food, round bread rings and bath towels adorned many of
the graves, symbols from an ancient tradition of offering things to
the dead they may need in the afterlife.
   Boughs from Christmas trees with long, yellow candles burning
were left on many graves and there were photographs of smiling
young faces tacked to crosses.
   The Romanian news agency Agerpress said a monument would be
erected at the cemetery to pay tribute the revolution's dead for
``their pure sacrifice for Romania's freedom.''

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed at a
record high for the second consecutive day today, while the dollar
declined against the Japanese yen for the fifth trading day in a
row.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
257.69 points Tuesday, added another 120.32 points, or 0.31
percent, closing at 38,801.63.
   Dealers said investors, encouraged by the yen's firmness against
the dollar, were buying on a broad front.
   Surging prices for futures contracts also led to strong
expectations of share price gains, they added.
   Volume traded on the exchange's first section was estimated at
900 million shares, up from 650 million shares Tuesday.
   The dollar closed at 142.10 yen, down 0.27 yen from Tuesday's
finish of 142.37 yen. After opening at 142.13 yen, it ranged
between 141.85 yen and 142.20 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 2.13 yen in five days.
   Currency dealers described trading as thin with the approaching
year-end holiday season.
   The market is expecting lower U.S. interest rates, dealers said,
while the yen is gaining some support from the Bank of Japan's
decision Monday to increase its official discount rate to 4.25
percent from 3.75 percent to stem inflationary pressure. Higher
interest rates usually make a country's currency more attractive to
investors.
   The U.S. official discount rate, the rate charged for central
bank loans to commercial banks, currently stands at 7 percent.

<HEAD>Riot Charges Overturned in Second Howard Beach Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has overturned the
misdemeanor riot convictions of three young men in the Howard Beach
racial killing and dismissed the indictments against them, saying
the trial judge committed two errors.
   Prosecutors either can appeal, resubmit evidence to a grand jury
for new indictments or dismiss the case against the three white
defendants.
   ``We are studying the opinion and we are considering a further
appeal, and that's as far as we are going to comment at this
particular point,'' Matthew Greenberg, a special assistant attorney
general, said Tuesday.
   The 19-year-old defendants _ William Bollander, Thomas Farino
and James Povinelli _ were charged with taking part in the attack
on three black men three years ago in the mainly white Howard Beach
section of Queens.
   One of the victims, Michael Griffith, was killed when the mob
chased him onto a highway where he was struck by a car.
   The three young men whose convictions were overturned were found
guilty in the second trial related to the case.
   In the first trial, three other white youths were convicted of
manslaughter and assault in the fatal attack. Their case is
apparently unaffected by the appellate ruling handed down Dec. 11.
   In overturning the misdemeanor convictions from the second
trial, a five-judge panel said the trial judge made two important
errors in charging the jury.
   The panel said the judge, Thomas A. Demakos, ``over strenuous
defense objections,'' furnished the jury with verdict sheets that
improperly described some of the alleged crimes.
   It said the judge also erred by refusing a defense request to
instruct the jury on disorderly conduct as a lesser offense of
second-degree riot.
   Defense lawyer Spiros A. Tsimbinos said he and his clients
learned of the ruling Saturday.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a community activist who advised the
attack victims not to cooperate with investigators until a special
prosecutor was appointed, said the ruling was ``an outrageous act.
It's a smack in the face of all people, especially black people.''
   Farino, Bollander and Povinelli were convicted in 1988 of
second-degree riot, but acquitted of a more serious felony riot
charge for their roles in the Dec. 20, 1986, attack.
   Demakos sentenced the three on Sept. 19, 1988, to 34 days in
jail to be served on weekends over a four-month period. But they
were granted a stay pending appeal and spent no time in jail after
their conviction.
   In July, the appellate panel unanimously upheld the conviction
and sentences of the three defendants convicted of manslaughter and
assault in the first Howard Beach trial.

<TEXT>
   Jews in the Soviet Union, the United States and
three other countries were brought together by state-of-the-art
technology to perform an ancient ritual _ the lighting of the
Hanukkah candles.
   Satellites were used Tuesday to connect gatherings in Brooklyn,
the Moscow Synagogue, Hyde Park in London, the Champs Elysees in
Paris and at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Candles for the fifth
night of the eight-night holiday were lighted in all five cities,
and youths in the locations took turns reading biblical and
Talmudic verses.
   The 90-minute cable television transmission ended with a speech
by Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox
Lubavitcher movement. Schneerson also handed out dimes to hundreds
of youngsters at the movement's world headquarters in Brooklyn in
keeping with the tradition of giving coins, called Hanukkah gelt.
   The candle in Jerusalem was lighted by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi
Mordehai Eliahu, one of Israel's two chief rabbis.
   Esther Bodzin, an 18-year-old seminary student from Detroit, was
one of several thousand people who watched the ceremony in
Jerusalem.
   ``I think it's amazing. Look at all the people here. This one TV
show is tying together the Jews from all over,'' she said.
   Rabbi Abraham Shemtov, national director of the American Friends
of Lubavitch, said the ceremony was arranged to mark the 40th
anniversary of Schneerson's leadership of the Lubavitcher movement.
   Hanukkah commemorates the victory in 165 B.C. of a small band of
Jews _ the Maccabees _ over the Greco-Syrian kingdom, which tried
to impose its culture on the Jews and had desecrated the holy
Temple in Jerusalem.
   According to legend, when the Jews entered Jerusalem and tried
to rekindle the Temple's eternal flame, they found enough oil for
one day, but the oil miraculously lasted eight days.
   The $150,000 cost of the program was paid by investor Ronald O.
Perelman, according to Shemtov.
   Richard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Lubavitchers, said
anyone with a home satellite dish could have seen the ceremony. He
said he did not know what cable systems carried the ceremony.

<HEAD>Officials Deny Cuba Smuggles Salvador-Bound Arms Through Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   High-ranking government officials deny U.S.
allegations that Cuba has established a route through Mexico for
shipping arms to El Salvador's leftist guerrillas.
   ``Mexico has been especially careful to establish facilities in
its territory for preventing the situations described,'' a Mexican
official said Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
   In a dispatch from Washington, The Associated Press reported
Monday that U.S. officials believe Cuba is shipping weapons across
the 130-mile wide Yucatan Channel, which leads to Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula. From there, the arms are loaded on trucks and taken on
an unknown route through Guatemala to El Salvador, the U.S.
officials said.
   One top Mexican official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the claim was ``irresponsible, lacking in credibility and
false.''
   The official said that the United States has never brought up
the matter officially and that the Mexican government would have no
comment on the record because the claim had been leaked.
   The Mexican government historically has been sympathetic to the
Salvadoran rebels in their decade-old war, but that support has
been muted since President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office a
year ago.
   U.S. officials contend Soviet bloc arms are reaching Salvadoran
rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front through
Cuba and Nicaragua, although recent administration statements
indicate they do not see the Soviet Union as the principal villain.
   The U.S. officials told the AP that Cuba was looking for new
ways to help the rebels and at the same time shield Nicaragua's
Sandinista government from further criticism.
   The Sandinistas were embarrassed in October when a truck
carrying arms was intercepted in Honduras and in November when a
plane carrying surface-to-air missiles was shot down in El Salvador.
   The Salvadoran rebels, who maintain offices in Mexico City,
refuse to confirm or deny that they receive arms from Cuba and
Nicaragua.
   ``But even if we do, so what?'' said one rebel official. ``The
United States is helping its own.''
   The Mexican official said the Mexican government has tried to
work with the United States to fight arms and drug trafficking. If
there was a problem, this official said, channels created for that
purpose should have been used.
   A Mexican law enforcement official also denied claims that his
country was being used to smuggle arms south and noted that the
shortest route would take the arms into the resort area of Cancun.
   He said there was some evidence that a route had been
established through Belize, south of Mexico on the Yucatan
peninsula.
   ``The coast is much less well guarded down there,'' said this
official.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch says his biggest regret as
he leaves office is that blacks ``do not perceive that I was their
friend.''
   ``I believe this administration has been more helpful to the
black minority than all administrations before us,'' he said
Tuesday. ``I don't think we got credit for it.''
   Koch, who lost his re-election bid to black Democrat David
Dinkins, spoke at his annual year-end meeting with reporters, the
last scheduled news conference of his 12 years in City Hall.
   He appointed the city's first black police commissioner and the
first black deputy mayor for economic development, and under his
administration, the percentage of civil service jobs held by
members of minority groups grew from 31 percent to 62 percent.
   Yet, he noted, ``Many people in the black community do not
perceive that I was their friend.''
   He also discussed his statement during the 1988 presidential
campaign that ``Jews and other supporters of Israel would be
crazy'' to vote for Jesse Jackson. The remark caused a black
backlash that carried into the 1989 Democratic mayoral primary,
when Dinkins took 97 percent of the black vote.
   Koch said the second half of his remark about Jackson went
unheeded. It was, ``... in the same way that blacks and supporters
of black causes would be crazy to vote for George Bush.''
   Koch said he would try to refrain from criticizing Dinkins for
the first six months after he takes office.
   But the mayor did not refrain from criticizing South African
Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who will speak at Dinkins' swearing-in.
   Koch said Tutu, who recently criticized Israel for its handling
of the Palestinian uprising and called for a Palestinian state, was
wrong for ``singling out Israel when it's under attack.''
   After 25 years in city and federal government, Koch, 65, a
former congressman and city councilman, said he won't consider
re-entering politics.
   Instead, he'll juggle a half-dozen new jobs _ including
commercial endorsements, a newspaper column, radio and TV
commentaries and teaching.
   Koch said the city is better off than when he took office in
1978 during a fiscal crisis that nearly bankrupted the city.
   ``I took the city and saved it from bankruptcy,'' he said.

   The YMCA is gearing up for a return to the Soviet
Union after more than 70 years of exile.
   The Young Men's Christian Association has been working with
private groups in the Soviet Union since May to establish branches
in at least four cities, said Celeste Wroblewski, spokeswoman for
the U.S. YMCA.
   Robert Masuda, director of the international division, will
travel there this spring to speak with charitable organizations and
citizen groups about opening center in Leningrad, Tbilisi in Soviet
Georgia, and Novosibirsk and Omsk in Siberia, Ms. Wroblewski said.
   ``We will see YMCA programs aimed at developing Soviet citizens'
minds, spirits and bodies,'' said Nicholas Goncharoff, director of
the American YMCA's statesmanship programs, who first contacted
Soviet organizations.
   In addition to the four cities targeted, the organization also
might open a branch in Kiev, he said.
   ``The difference, however, is that they will be called the YFCA,
for Youth Families Christian Association,'' said Goncharoff, a
Soviet emigre who stayed at a New York YMCA during his first five
months in the United States in 1952. A spokesman for the Soviet
Embassy in Washington, D.C., said he hadn't heard about the YMCA
reopening in his country.
   ``Nowadays, there are so many organizations and we can't know
every one of them,'' said Andrei Parastayev, the embassy's first
secretary. ``There is a rise in political activities of the young
people, and of course they want to express themselves.''
   Goncharoff said the reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev have made it possible for the YMCA to attempt a return.
   ``Only since Gorbachev could such a historic event be
possible,'' he said in a recent interview. ``The last five years,
we began to explore actively the idea of YMCA in Russia.''
   The YMCA had firm roots in Czarist Russia, with branches mainly
devoted to physical activities for young men. But after the 1917
Bolshevik revolution, its doors in Petrograd _ now Leningrad _ and
many other cities were shut, Goncharoff said.
   Today, the organization intends to give Soviet youths training
in Western management styles and let them participate in exchanges
with American and Canadian youths, he said.
   ``There is a great excitement for solving community problems in
the Soviet Union, and that's what the YMCA is all about here,'' Ms.
Wroblewski said.
   The organization also plans to offer activities involving music,
theater and other arts, Goncharoff said.
   The YMCA was founded in London in 1844 as a conduit for
religious study. It has spread to 97 countries and serves about 30
million people, Ms. Wroblewski said.

   He roared like a lion, but when it
was time to fight he scurried like a mouse, running from hole to
hole as U.S. paratroopers tried to trap him.
   ``He repressed us for years and then he humiliated us by giving
up without a fight,'' said taxi driver Pedro Hernandez. ``I never
supported him, but he should have fought.''
   There was no final power play and Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
didn't go down in a blaze of bullets, a fitting end for someone to
be romanticized in Latin American folklore once his political
crimes and other sins are forgotten.
   ``He did not even have the guts to kill himself,'' said
housewife Martiza Martinez.
   Instead of the name ``commander of dignity'' his cronies gave
him because he stood up to Americans, Mrs. Martinez said he was the
``commander of indignity.''
   Although most Panamanians were opposed to the military strongman
who named and fired six presidents like shop supervisors, they
almost believed his nationalist rhetoric of fighting to the death.
   He was said to enjoy a crisis, and it seemed that was the case
as he survived threat after threat to his reign. Many expected him
to die fighting, to be ``carried out of the barracks face up.''
   Noriega was defiant and mocking when the United States indicted
him in 1988 on drug trafficking charges. He vowed ``our life for
Panama'' and said the U.S. accusations were masking designs to
renege on the Panama Canal treaties and maintain the U.S. military
presence in Panama.
   For more than a year Noriega repressed all dissent, silenced all
opposition, survived two coup attempts and got away with annulling
the May 7 election his candidates lost. He portrayed himself as
David fighting the American Goliath, arms in the air, ever the
winner.
   In the end, even his government-run newspapers and radio
stations almost believed the propaganda. Noriega became a hero, a
man who could do no wrong, the savior of Panama while the Americans
were stupid, their soldiers cowards, drug addicts and AIDS carriers.
   So his flight to the Vatican's embassy on Sunday to seek asylum
was an anticlimax not only for his supporters, who hoped he would
take to the hills and lead an insurgency war, but also to
detractors who wished him dead.
   ``I did not think he was going to be such a coward,'' said a
government official who had sympathized with Noreiga and requested
anonymity bacause he wants to keep his job in the new U.S.-backed
government.
   ``It was a big bluff,'' said Judith Alvarez, who said she was
still ``nervous'' even though Noriega was closeted in the Vatican
mission. ``I will feel safe when I see him behind bars.''
   Many Panamanians felt it was more a question of the Americans
suffering him until their patience ran out. That happened on Dec.
16 when members of Noriega's security forces killed an American
soldier in civilian clothes near Panamanian military headquarers.
   U.S. Army South commander Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, a
Mexican-American from Texas who considered Noriega an affront to
Latin America, angrily demanded an explanation and an apology and
threatened military reprisal.
   But when 26,000 U.S. troops invaded the country one week ago,
Noriega was surprised. And there were not many in his 15,000-member
Defense Forces willing to fight for him.
   Most units surrendered, although the 1,800 or so who fought back
surprised the Americans with their stubborn resistance.
   But according to U.S. officials, Noriega never led the troops in
battle. When the first shots were fired, he fled and spent the next
six days running from place to place as U.S. soldiers combed the
city looking for him and his associates, most of whom were turned
in by angry neighbors.
   And Panama City paid a high price.
   El Chorrillo, a populous low-income barrio of old wooden
structures around the Panamanian military headquarters, was leveled
by the guns of the U.S. Army's Sheridan tanks. The number of dead
in the neighborhood, known for its Friday night street
celebrations, will never be known.
   Moaned taxi driver Hernandez: ``All those people died because of
this coward.''

<HEAD>Nevada Governor Rejects Federal Nuclear Dump Permit Requests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Miller has set the stage for a
court battle with the federal government by rejecting four permits
to study a Nevada site's suitability as the nation's first
high-level radioactive waste dump.
   ``This issue will certainly go to court,'' Miller said Tuesday
after rejecting the permit requests by the federal Energy
Department. ``The Legislature has passed and I have signed bills
that make the dump illegal here.
   ``We cannot issue permits allowing the DOE to begin testing a
site we have outlawed. They can't proceed without these permits.''
   Carl Gertz, the Energy Department's project manager for the
proposed Yucca Mountain site 110 miles northwest of Las Vegas,
agreed that Miller's action made a court battle inevitible.
   He said a lawsuit would be filed early next year to obtain the
permits.
   ``It seems strange to us that state officials say Yucca Mountain
is not suitable for the repository, yet the state will not grant us
the permits needed to make that determination scientifically,'' he
said.
   Current plans call for a waste site to be established by the
year 2010 to store 70,000 metric tons of radioactive wastes for
10,000 years. Yucca Mountain is the only location in the country
under consideration.
   Miller said the Energy Department has no authority to conduct
experiments at Yucca Mountain without the state's approval. That
was blocked earlier this year when the Legislature passed a bill
forbidding the storage of high-level nuclear waste in Nevada.
   Energy Department officials maintain the state cannot ban the
repository until the president recommends a site to Congress.

   A Bengal tiger bit off a 19-year-old zookeeper's
arm as she was giving it water with a hose from outside its cage at
a northern Japan safari park, police said today.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attack occurred Tuesday at the Tohoku Safari Park Zoo in Fukushima
state, 150 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Kimie Nagasaku, told police from her hospital bed that she was
giving the animal water from outside the cage when it bit off her
right arm at the elbow, but she declined to discuss details, the
official said.
   The official said police believed she might have put her hand
into the cage as she guided the hose. The tiger could not have
reached through the 2-inch space between bars in the cage, he said.
   Akihiko Ando, a zoo official, said other keepers heard a scream
and rushed to the tiger's cage. Ms. Nagasaku had fed the tiger and
cleaned its cage daily since April 1, officials said.
   Ando said it was the first case of anyone being hurt by an
animal at the zoo since it opened 11 years ago.
   There are about 130 carnivorous animals in the zoo and about 1
million people visit it annually, he said.

<HEAD>Noriega Aide Pleads Innocent to Drug Charges in Miami</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A close aide to Gen. Manuel Noriega pleaded
innocent to federal charges of drug smuggling, money-laundering and
racketeering, saying he chose to surrender to U.S. troops in Panama
so he could stand trial.
   Lt. Col. Luis del Cid is charged in the same February 1988
indictment that accuses the ousted Panamanian dictator and leaders
of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel of importing cocaine into the
United States.
   Del Cid, 46, commanded a Panamanian Defense Forces unit in the
province of Chiriqui until he gave himself up Saturday to U.S.
forces that invaded the country to oust Noriega.
   ``I surrendered myself _ I wanted to be brought here,'' del Cid
told U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami on Tuesday.
   Del Cid strongly denied the charges against him. He then
formally pleaded innocent to all four counts and demanded a jury
trial.
   ``He told his troops not to fire, not to engage in any combat,
to turn their arms in,'' Assistant Public Defender Ken Swartz said
after the hearing.
   ``He didn't want any more bloodshed. It was his desire to
surrender to the (U.S.) forces, and to come here to face these
charges,'' said Swartz.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen described del Cid as ``one of the
right-hand men of General Noriega.''
   ``We allege (del Cid) personally imported shipments of cocaine,
and he personally transmitted large amounts of cash,'' Lehtinen
said.
   Hoeveler appointed Swartz as del Cid's temporary counsel after
the Panamanian testified he had only $7,000 with him. Del Cid said
he couldn't get funds from his Panama savings account, which has
been frozen.
   Del Cid is unemployed, Swartz told the judge, adding, ``His
former employer is out of business.''
   The judge blocked efforts by the U.S. attorney's office to ask
detailed questions of del Cid in an effort to uncover any
additional assets. Hoeveler said such testimony could affect the
racketeering counts against the Panamanian.
   Del Cid, who if convicted could be sentenced to 70 years in
prison and fined $550,000, was ordered held without bond until a
full hearing Jan. 2.
   The judge also denied a request by prosecutors to block contact
between del Cid and Noriega's U.S. attorneys.
   ``Needless to say, we wish to monitor this case to see what's
happening, and obviously look at what, if any, evidence the
government may have,'' said Frank Rubino, one of the Noriega's
attorneys in Florida.
   After the hearing, Lehtinen referred all questions about Noriega
to officials in Washington, and refused to say what contacts his
office had made with del Cid.
   Lehtinen also refused to comment on whether del Cid has
indicated he might testify against Noriega.
   Del Cid, Noriega, cartel leader Pablo Escobar Gaviria and 12
others are accused in the Miami indictment of running drugs and
using Panama as a safe haven for traffickers.
   The indictment alleges that del Cid was used by Noriega as an
emissary as Noriega allowed the cartel to process drugs, launder
money, and ship cocaine through Panama.
   In addition, Noriega is accused of taking a $4.6 million bribe
from the Colombians.
   Del Cid is accused of being personally involved in a
400-kilogram cocaine shipment to Florida in December 1982.
   He also allegedly picked up $100,000 from Noriega's personal
pilot, Floyd Carlton Cacerez in November 1982, and delivered
$200,000 to Carlton at the military headquarters in Panama City a
month later.
   Carlton is a principal witness in the case.

<TEXT>
   A Japanese man was arrested at the
international airport trying to smuggle nearly 300 endangered
turtles and lizards to Japan in his suitcases, a police officer
said today.
   Tsuyoshi Shirawa, 20, was arrested Sunday after authorities
discovered that his four suitcases contained 98 turtles and 185
Oriental water lizards, said police Capt. Paiboon Arinchai.
   Shiwara told police he brought the reptiles from Malaysia and
stopped in Bangkok to visit a friend en route to Japan.
   Convicted of possession of endangered wildlife on Monday,
Shiwara received a three-month suspended prison sentence and was
fined $100.
   Paiboon said the reptiles were tightly packed into the baggage
and bound to prevent them from making noise and moving. Two turtles
and one lizard died.
   Boonlerd Angsirijida, a Forestry Department official charged
with wildlife conservation, said Japan was a major market for
wildlife from Thailand, Indonesia, the Phillipines and South
American countries.
   Last month, Japan returned to Thailand 58 wild animals that had
been smuggled into Japan. Among these were white-handed gibbons,
Burmese molurus pythons and slow loris monkeys.
   Thailand has been widely criticized as a major transit nation
for illegal international trade in wildlife.

   For six months, Brian L. Cozad had
lived with and cared for his grandmother. On Christmas Eve, he died
with her in a high-rise retirement home fire that killed 16 and
injured dozens.
   Cozad, 29, who returned to Johnson City last summer after
working in Florida, found his grandmother in failing health and
moved in with her at the John Sevier Retirement Center.
   His 79-year-old grandmother, Carman L. Baughan, a retired
bookkeeper, suffered from cancer and emphysema.
   ``She was bedfast and on oxygen,'' said Baughnie Brumit, the
woman's daughter and Cozad's mother. ``For the past six weeks, he
had more or less waited on her hand and foot.''
   ``They were very close and she was getting sicker,'' Mrs. Brumit
said. ``He was very caring where she was concerned.''
   While authorities continued investigating the cause of the fire
in the 11-story center, building residents tried to deal with their
feelings about the Christmas Eve disaster.
   ``It breaks me up to talk about it,'' said Herman Rankin, who
had lived in the center for six months.
   Mental health professionals have volunteered their time to
counsel survivors, said Jane Harris, a disaster worker with the Red
Cross.
   Red Cross officials said some people have been so upset, they
have not been eating.
   ``I've been torn up about it,'' said Duaine Hampton, an 11-year
resident.
   Rankin and Hampton were among 23 people from the center staying
at a hotel. Forty-five others are staying with relatives, Red Cross
officials said Tuesday.
   Paul Souder, an assistant to Fire Chief Doug Buckles, said
investigators do not suspect arson.
   The fire was the second fatal fire in the center in two months.
In October, a 76-year-old resident died of smoke inhalation, but
all residents were evacuated.
   Firefighters quickly extinguished the October blaze through an
internal piping system that brought water through the building.
   By the time firefighters arrived Sunday night, the fire was out
of control.

   Random shots apparently fired by drug dealers
``flexing their muscles'' killed two bystanders, including a woman
who died after giving birth to a healthy boy, police said.
   Lisa Biffle, 26, who was nine months pregnant, died Tuesday at
Queens Hospital Center. She had been shot in the abdomen late
Monday as she sat in a car in front of the South Jamaica Housing
Project.
   The bullet missed the baby, who was delivered two hours later by
Caesarean section and was in good condition.
   A Jehovah's Witness, Mrs. Biffle declined blood transfusions for
religious reasons, said her father, Hugh Carter.
   The shots were fired by three or four men who drove by.
   The other victim, Ebony Williams, 18, was shot in the head as
she stopped at a phone booth to call a cab to take her and a friend
to the movies, said Police Lt. Eugene Dunbar.
   Wounded in the shooting was Mrs. Biffle's husband, Dwayne, 25,
who was in fair condition after being shot in the foot.
   Ms. Williams and the Biffles ``were definitely innocent
victims,'' Dunbar said. ``These people happened to be in the wrong
spot.''
   There was no known motive for the shooting, but Dunbar said
investigators believed ``it's probably some drug dealers flexing
their muscles.''

   The dollar was lower in quiet, late-morning
trading in Europe today, and gold prices also fell.
   Traders attributed the dollar's weaker tone mostly to
expectations that U.S. interest rates will decline further.
   ``It's a continuation of a trend already in place, but which has
been renewed by expectation of easing U.S. monetary policy,'' said
a trader in Milan, Italy.
   Traders said, however, that the market was very thin with
activity limited to small, end-of-the-year commercial orders.
   The European markets were closed Monday and Tuesday for
Christmas.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 142.10 yen, down 0.27 yen from
Tuesday. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 141.85
yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6885 West German marks, down from 1.7090
   _1.5310 Swiss francs, down from 1.5475
   _5.7750 French francs, down from 5.8385

   _1,266.00 Italian lire, down from 1,277.75
   _1.1590 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1585
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6305 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6205 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $408.40 a troy ounce,
down from $412.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $409.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $409.45, down from $413.00 bid late
Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell to close at a bid $408.49, down $3.28

<TEXT>
   Panama's new president and two vice presidents made
a secret pact to say they were sworn in on Panamanian territory,
although the ceremony actually took place on a U.S. military base,
it was reported today.
   Anticipating questions about the legitimacy of their government,
President Guillermo Endara and his vice presidents swore themselves
to secrecy about the ceremony at Fort Clayton, outside Panama City,
The Miami Herald reported, citing sources who demanded anonymity.
   Responding to previous reports he was sworn in at a U.S. base
during the U.S. invasion that ousted Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel
Noriega, Endara told The Associated Press Saturday:
   ``I was sworn in on Panamanian territory, in a Panamanian home
after 1 a.m. (Wednesday). Then in the morning we went to Fort
Clayton.''
   He didn't identify the home's owners.
   Among those who signed the swearing-in document were Endara,
First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon and Second Vice
President Guillermo Ford. Also present were the vice presidents'
wives and several U.S. and Panamanian officials, the paper said.
   ``We were taken to Fort Clayton at about midnight, and told we
couldn't make outside phone calls or leave the room,'' one
participant told the Herald. ``The ceremony took place at about 2
a.m. (Wednesday), and we agreed to say it had taken place in
Panamanian territory.''
   The group stayed in a building at Fort Clayton until Wednesday
afternoon, when two mortar shots fired by Noriega forces hit the
ground nearby.
   Then they were shuttled to another building at the base, where
they remained until Thursday morning, about 30 hours after the
invasion started, the Herald reported.
   Then they went to Panama's Legislative Assembly building, where
U.S. forces established Endara's first provisional headquarters,
the paper said.
   Endara's government was elected May 7, but Noriega never let the
new leaders take power.

   Warmer weather was making a welcome return to the South today,
and a cold front was moving east from the Plains, bringing more
cold, dry weather.
   Mild, dry weather was expected across the West, and a cold front
with a little rain or snow was forecast for the Pacific Northwest,
where snow fell in Pendleton, Ore., this morning.
   In much of the South, where a Christmas weekend freeze burst
water pipes in thousands of homes and businesses, overnight
temperatures were at or near freezing. Temperatures today were
forecast to rise to the 60s from Texas across Louisiana through
Florida, and the 40s and 50s in the rest of the South.
   Miami's highs could reach 80 by the weekend, according to the
National Weather Service.
   A cold high-pressure system moved east from Iowa today, followed
by slightly warmer air. The front was expected to scatter freezing
rain and light snow as it moved across the Ohio Valley and Great
Lakes into New England.
   The front was expected to bring dry, sunny and cold weather to
the Northeast today, with tempratures from near zero in far
northern New England, rising to the 20s in New York City, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, and to the 30s in Maryland and Virginia.
   Fog returned this morning to Seattle and Salt Lake City, where
heavy fog disrupted airline travel Tuesday.
   At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, flights were diverted
or delayed for nine hours Tuesday, causing a traffic snarl on
nearby roads because stranded passengers' cars jammed all the
garages.
   At Salt Lake City International Airport, some flights were
diverted and others delayed up to an hour Tuesday, despite efforts
at fog-dispersal _ a technique much like cloud-seeding that
involves sprinkling dry ice, or carbon dioxide, from planes.
   Fog also was expected this morning in parts of Montana, Idaho
and Utah, as well as in California's Sacramento and San Joaquin
valleys.
   Temperatures were expected to rise to the 70s along the southern
fringe of the desert Southwest, and the 50s in northern New Mexico,
Arizona and California.

<HEAD>Gorbachev to Visit Lithuania to Try to Mend Party Rift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will travel to
Lithuania in coming days to try to persuade the republic's defiant
Communist Party to reaffirm its allegiance to the national party,
officials say.
   When it declared itself independent on Dec. 20 the Lithuanian
Communist Party created the first major crack in the political
monopoly forged by Vladimir Lenin after the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution.
   Gorbachev attacked the Lithuanian party leadership at a meeting
of the Soviet party's Central Committee held Monday and Tuesday to
consider the Lithuanian break with Moscow.
   He accused the Lithuanians of allowing themselves to become
``hostages to separatists.''
   But, in a report published Tuesday in the party newspaper
Pravda, he also urged ``maximum restraint'' to allow emotions to
cool. The 250-member Central Committee unanimously approved the
report.
   The committee decided to send Gorbachev and other top party
officials to Lithuania ``to explain our position and at the same
time to get a better sense of the situation there,'' Vadim A.
Medvedev, a Politburo member and the party's chief ideologist, told
a news conference afterward.
   Medvedev said some officials at the Central Committee meeting
proposed ousting the Lithuanians from the national party or
annulling the Lithuanian decision, but others pushed more moderate
measures.
   All were united, however, in their disapproval of the Lithuanian
move, Mededev said. ``Most agreed that this was a blow to
perestroika,'' he said, referring to Gorbachev's program to
restructure the Soviet economy and to a certain extent the
political system.
   Medvedev said the trip to Lithuania would take place ``in not
very many days'' and that the Central Committee will make a firm
decision on the dispute in January.
   The Lithuanian Communist leader, Algirdas Brazauskas, said in an
interview that the party officials' visit would be ``good and
helpful,'' an editor at Lithuanian Radio said.
   Despite the postponement of a full decision, the Central
Committee's stand as stated Tuesday refused to recognize the
Lithuanian party's self-proclaimed independent status.
   ``No part of the Soviet Communist Party has the right to decide
the question about its independent existence with its own program
and rules, not taking into account the position of the Soviet
Communist Party as a whole,'' Gorbachev said in the report approved
by the plenum. ``And this means that the Communist Party of
Lithuania was and remains a part of the united Soviet Communist
Party.''
   Gorbachev tried for several months to head off the Lithuanian
split.
   At the Congress of People's Deputies meeting in Moscow on
Saturday he lashed out at separatists: ``Today, to realize the
right to self-determination through secession means to blow up the
union, set the people against each other and sow conflict and blood
and death.''
   Gorbachev told the Central Committee meeting the Soviet
government should consider the legal status of movements that are
``carrying out separatist activities and whipping up nationalist
terror.''
   He did not identify any such organizations, but in the context
of the debate he likely was referring to Lithuania's people's
front, known as Sajudis, and other groups pushing for independence
from the Soviet Union.
   Medvedev said the fight against separatist groups would not
involve the use of force by Moscow. ``We're against application of
the military or other such methods,'' he said.
   Thousands of people gathered Tuesday in Vilnius, Lithuania's
capital, for a rally in support of the regional party's move, said
Lithuanian Radio editor Eduardas Potasinskas.
   Brazauskas, in an interview with the Interfax news service
published Tuesday, defended his party's decision as a ``step toward
renewal of the party.''
   ``The idea is to make sure that the public perceives it as a new
political force with a new message,'' he said.
   Medvedev, however, said the Lithuanian party would end up
``crushed by separatist and nationalist forces'' without Moscow's
support.
   Despite Gorbachev's bluster, Brazauskas and other Lithuanian
party leaders maintain that the Soviet leader has shown
understanding of their move.

   Romania's Princess Ileana, now a nun at an
Orthodox monastery in rural western Pennsylvania, said her homeland
was saved ``in the nick of time'' by a revolution she never thought
she'd live to see.
   ``I always believed my prayers would be answered,'' the Rev.
Mother Alexandra said Tuesday.
   The 80-year-old daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie, and
great-granddaughter of England's Queen Victoria and Czar Alexander
II of Russia, said her European contacts told her ousted President
Nicolae Ceausescu had to die.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed by a firing squad
Monday following conviction by a secret military tribunal. The
former Communist leader and his wife had been captured Saturday, a
day after a popular uprising forced him from power.
   He was denounced as the ``Antichrist'' and accused of killing
60,000 people.
   ``They said 60,000 is enough ... and it (execution) had to be
done because it would have gone on and on and on,'' Mother
Alexandra said in a telephone interview from the Orthodox Monastery
of the Transfiguration near Ellwood City. ``They had to do it, so
they tell me. I personally have no opinion.''
   Mother Alexandra's father was king from 1914 until his death in
1927. Her nephew, King Michael, was forced to abdicate by the
communists in 1947 and lives in Switzerland.
   ``I didn't expect the whole thing, I must say. I've lived with
it so long. It's been 42 years since I left,'' she said.
   ``The strength of the country has always been in its peasantry.
That's what Ceausescu was destroying. I hope there is enough of
them left and enough intellectuals left to be able to build again.''
   Princess Ileana was exiled from Romania with the rest of the
royal family soon after King Michael's abdication in December 1947.
   She immigrated with her husband, an archduke of Austria, and
their six children to Switzerland and then Argentina before
settling in 1950 in the United States. The move ultimately led to
divorce.
   She ended a second marriage to become a postulant, or a
candidate for the religious order, in 1961. Six years later, she
took her monastic vows and put up a trailer outside Ellwood City to
began building an English-speaking monastery for Orthodox women of
all ethnic backgrounds.
   Mother Alexandra said she has spent much of the past week on the
telephone with friends and relatives in Europe, keeping abreast of
developments and consoling friends of the many who died in the
uprising.
   She said that even with the changes elsewhere in Eastern Europe
she did not expect such quick, drastic moves in her homeland.
   ``Quite honestly, I was feeling very depressed about it,'' she
said. ``I thought everybody was doing something but nothing was
moving in Romania at all. And suddenly, it blew up.''
   Mother Alexandra said she is working with the Romanian Orthodox
Episcopate of America in Jackson, Mich., to organize a Save Romania
Fund. She also plans a special service at the monastery this week
for Romania's dead.
   She said she would consider returning to Romania ``if I could be
of use.''

<HEAD>Lebanon Complains to U.N. About Israeli Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon said today it was lodging an
urgent complaint with the U.N. Security Council about Israel's
latest ground and air attacks that reportedly killed 12 people and
wounded 31.
   The attacks, which occurred 12 hours apart on Tuesday, destroyed
two guerrilla bases of the Communist Party in central and southern
Lebanon.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss' office said instructions were being
transmitted to Lebanon's U.N. mission to complain of ``this blatant
aggression.'' The office said Lebanon would not ask for a council
debate.
   Israeli paratroopers backed by tanks and helicopter gunships
destroyed one guerrilla base in southeast Lebanon before dawn, and
warplanes blasted a command post of the same group at sunset
further to the north.
   Rescuers worked under spotlights overnight to dig out victims
from the rubble of the two-story command post in the coastal town
of Rmeile, 20 miles south of Beirut.
   Police said the final casualty toll of the Rmeile attack stood
at 10 killed and 28 wounded, the heaviest among Israel's 18 air
raids into Lebanon this year. Twenty-eight people have been killed
and 137 wounded in the 18 air strikes since Jan. 11.
   Two Communist guerrillas were killed and three wounded in the
earlier ground assault on the base in the southeastern village of
Nabi Safi.
   The assault, staged by 100 paratroopers backed by four tanks and
eight armored personnel carriers, was the Israeli army's heaviest
ground advance into Lebanon since an assault on the Syrian-backed
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command on
Dec. 9, 1988.
   The attack force advanced from Israel's self-proclaimed border
zone, a two- to 15-mile wide buffer zone north of the Israeli
border, which Israel and the Israeli-allied South Lebanese Army
have controlled since 1982.
   The Communists have been blamed for several terrorist attacks in
Israel as well as the attempted assassination in November 1988 of
the South Lebanese Army commander.
   Elsewhere in southern Lebanon, rival Shiite Moslem militias
battled into a fifth day today in southern Lebanon.
   Police said eight people were killed and 37 wounded in artillery
and tank fire duels Tuesday and early today between the
fundamentalist Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal militia. That
raised the overall toll to 46 killed and 187 wounded since the
current round of fighting began Saturday.
   The two factions have been vying for mastery of Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest sect, for more than two
years.
   The overall toll of the intermittent power struggle since May
1987 stands at 617 killed and 1,766 wounded.

   A car struck by a hit-and-run driver ran up on a

others, police said.
   Ma Kit Ching, 52, and Hector Hernandez, 9, were killed in the
Tuesday afternoon accident. The child's mother, Yvonne Orive, 35,
was in critical condition at Maimonides Medical Center, said Sgt.
Ed Burns, a police spokesman.
   Catacutan Kit, 8, also was in critical condition at Maimonides.
Ms. Ching and Catacutan apparently were not related, Burns said.
   The driver of the car that hit the four Brooklyn pedestrians was
not charged, Burns said. The other driver was being sought.

   Actress Betty Garde, who appeared in hundreds
of radio plays and portrayed Aunt Eller in the original Broadway
production of ``Oklahoma,'' is dead at 84.
   Miss Garde died Monday at a Sherman Oaks hospital, said Elliott
Reid, a longtime friend.
   Born Katherine Elizabeth Garde in Philadelphia, the actress
began her stage career in the early 1920s. She played character
roles in Broadway productions such as ``The Social Register'' and
``The Primrose Path.''
   In the 1930s she moved into radio, appearing in three dozen
shows over the years, including ``The Eddie Cantor Show,'' ``Perry
Mason'' and ``The Fat Man.''
   She probably was best known as the wife of ``Lorenzo Jones'' and
as ``Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch.''
   She worked on several Orson Welles radio specials and appeared
regularly in the dramatic anthology ``Theater Guild on the Air.''
   She had a few motion picture and television roles, notably as
Wanda Skutnik in the James Stewart film ``Call Northside 777.''
   Reid said she had no known immediate survivors.

<HEAD>Vatican: No Legal Way to Give Noriega to U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican said today there is no legal way
its embassy in Panama can hand over Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
U.S. authorities.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro also said the Vatican had not
discussed with any countries the possibility of arranging exile for
Noriega, who turned himself in to the Vatican Embassy in Panama
City on Sunday.
   Navarro told a news conference that Noriega took refuge after
the papal nuncio, or ambassador to Panama, agreed to let the ousted
dictator stay in the embassy. He arrived there five days after U.S.
troops invaded Panama in an effort to capture Noriega and restore
the elected government.
   Asked about U.S. demands that the embassy directly turn over
Noriega to U.S. authorities, Navarro said there was no legal way
that could be done. He said the embassy is empowered to deal only
with the government of Panama and no other foreign government.
   The Panamanian government has not made any request for Noriega,
Navarro added.
   He said the Vatican and the United States were working together
to find a legal solution satisfactory to both sides.
   ``We're dealing with a complex problem whose various elements
cannot be ignored. These elements include legal considerations,
diplomatic, humanitarian and therefore ethical ones,'' he said in a
statement.
   Asked about reports of hard feelings between the Vatican and the
United States, Navarro said, ``There has been no element at all
that could be called a situation of strain, tension,
misunderstanding.''
   He said meetings between U.S. and Vatican officials on the
Noriega case ``have taken place from the beginning in a clear and
very cordial climate.''
   The comments contrasted with reports from Washington, where a
State Department source said Monday that the United States had
demanded ``in extraordinarily tough terms'' that the Vatican turn
over Noriega to the United States, where he faces drug charges.
   Earlier this week, Navarro virtually ruled out the possibility
Noriega would simply be turned over to U.S. authorities as demanded
by the Bush administration.
   Vatican officials have said Noriega will probably be granted
exile in a third country.
   However, Navarro said the Vatican had not been in contact with
any countries about the possibility of offering Noriega exile and
said it was too soon to talk about that.
   Navarro said three other Panamanians arrived at the embassy
Sunday with Noriega. He identified them only as a military captain,
his wife, and another military official.
   He said the Holy See believes the matter can be resolved in
``days, not weeks'' but provided no evidence of progress in talks
on the fate of the deposed Panamanian strongman.

<HEAD>Queen Mary Officer May Be Next Fired by Disney for Refusing To Shave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first officer of the Queen Mary
said he'll probably be the next to walk the plank following firings
of two waiters whose mustaches ran afoul of a Walt Disney Co.
grooming code.
   First Officer John Magness said he planned to keep the mustache
he has worn for 42 years while serving on ships around the world.
   ``I'm going to work, punch in as usual, and if they want to fire
me, they can find me and fire me,'' Magness, 65, said Tuesday,
adding that he would fight the anticipated dismissal in court.
   Waiters Reza Nazertehrani and Tom Nicolai were dismissed
Christmas Eve for refusing to shave facial hair forbidden by
Disney, which owns the leaseholds on the permanently docked ocean
liner in Long Beach Harbor.
   ``I got a beautiful present from the Disney corporation _ my
pink slip,'' said Nazertehrani, a 12{-year Queen Mary employee.
   Nicolai, 26, said the 35-year-old Disney policy barring facial
hair is out of date.
   Both men said they would file union grievances protesting their
dismissals.
   The grooming code bans mustaches, beards and long hair on men.
Bright eye shadow, red fingernails or two-toned hair for women are
forbidden.
   Nazertehrani, 43, said the issue involved more than appearance.
   ``I am Iranian,'' he said. ``This mustache is part of my
culture. It is a thing of pride.''
   Five or fewer Queen Mary workers have lost their jobs for
refusing to shave, said Rich Kerlin, a spokesman for the tourist
attraction. He said the firing of Nazertehrani and Nicolai on
Christmas Eve was an accident of scheduling.
   Disney bought rights to the ship a couple years ago, but only
imposed its companywide dress and grooming codes on it recently in
conjunction with a promotional campaign.
   ``I think the initial reluctance people expressed has subsided.
It was controversial for only a week or two,'' Kerlin said.
   The no-facial hair restriction puzzles some who recall that Walt
Disney sported a mustache.

<HEAD>Rallies Mark 10th Anniversary of Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Afghan refugees today rallied in
several Pakistani camps to mark the 10th anniversary of the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan.
   Also today, Western diplomats in Islamabad said the latest
reports indicate the Communist government, which the Red Army left
behind in Afghanistan in February, has arrested more than 200
people in a recent coup plot.
   Tens of thousands of Afghan guerrillas and their supporters
burned effigies and listened to impassioned speeches at refugee
camps around the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar, where several
U.S.-backed rebel groups are based.
   They vowed to keep fighting for the downfall of President Najib
and pledged to replace his Marxist administration with a
guerrilla-run, Moslem government.
   About 100,000 Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in
December 1979 to replace one pro-Moscow government with another.
They stayed on to help fight the insurgency that began when the
Afghan Communists seized power in 1978.
   Soviet forces fought the guerrillas for nine years before
completing a phased withdrawal Feb. 15. The Kremlin continues
massive military supplies to the Kabul government. The Moslem
rebels are supported by the United States.
   The Communists still hold Afghanistan's major cities, but the
guerrillas control most of the countryside.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the hard-line Hezb-i-Islami
guerrilla group, told a crowd of supporters at the Hyatabad refugee
camp near Peshawar today that his party would never enter a
coalition with the Communists.
   ``We believe that only the cessation of delivery of arms to the
crumbling Kabul regime will seal the fall of this disgusting
regime,'' Hekmatyar said.
   He also has accused the United States of interfering with his
aims.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
has arrested more than 200 people in the latest outbreak of
factional infighting in Kabul.
   Officials in Kabul reported only the arrest of about 100
clandestine Hekmatyar supporters earlier this month. However,
Western diplomats allege that it was a coup plot among members of
the Afghan army.
   In recent years, the governing ``Parcham'' wing of Najib's party
has survived several conspiracies by the ``Khlaq'' faction, which
is dominated by the military.
   An estimated 2 million Afghans have fled the civil war to
neighboring Pakistan and 1 million went to Iran.

   The head of a new East German opposition
party today withdrew from talks between East Germany's coalition
government and other opposition groups after he was accused of
corruption.
   The announcement came as the talks, which concern the future
course of the country, resumed today after a Christmas break.
   Wolfgang Schnur, chairman of the Democratic Awakening Party, was
accused in the newspaper Junge Welt of using his position to obtain
a large apartment that originally had been allocated to a family
with several children.
   The 45-year-old lawyer denied the allegations but said he was
withdrawing from the talks until the matter had been clarified. He
said he was the target of a ``massive campaign'' aimed at
discrediting him and his party politically, and he claimed his
mother, who is Jewish, has received threats from neo-Nazis.
   Schnur, elected chairman of Democratic Awakening earlier this
month when the opposition group met to constitute itself as a
political party, said he would seek a vote of confidence from the
party board.
   Since the fall of hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker on
Oct. 18, East Germans have been intent on rooting out corruption.
Most such allegations have centered on the top levels of the
now-ousted Communist Party leadership.
   East German leaders have instituted dizzying changes following
protests by hundreds of thousands of people for democratic reform.
It opened the Berlin Wall as part of loosened travel restrictions
in November, promised free elections and called for the talks
between Communist and opposition leaders.
   Honecker's successor, Egon Krenz, also resigned as president and
a non-Communist replaced him in a new coalition government, which
includes the Communists and four traditionally allied parties.
Communist Premier Hans Modrow is handling day-to-day affairs until
the free elections.
   The talks involve 37 representatives from five established
political parties, including the Communists, and representatives of
16 opposition groups.
   The discussion group is acting as a watchdog group on Modrow's
government until the elections May 6.
   Junge Welt, a youth-oriented newspaper once closely allied with
the Communists, made the allegations against Schnur.
   Schnur's party has maintained close contacts with West German
officials but is split on the question of reunification. It has
also called for a free market system in East Germany, although
there is a dispute on this topic as well.
   His movement has existed as a party for only two weeks, and its
national influence is still hard to assess.
   Schnur said he would sue the newspaper, which has become
increasingly independent and aggressive in its reporting. Schnur
also said his mother received anonymous letters containing threats
from neo-Nazis.
   East German leaders have said they are on guard against a
possible rise in nationalist and neo-Nazi groups, as a result of
the turmoil gripping the Communist country.

named Skippy allegedly opened fire as the dog's owner was headed
outside to give the mailman a bottle of vodka for Christmas, police
said.
   ``I got to the door, and boom,'' said Tammie Brody, 27, owner of
the 2-year-old German shepherd mix. ``I don't know what happened.
He just freaked out and shot the dog ... for absolutely no reason.''
   Letter carrier Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, of Pacoima, was
arrested after the 1:45 p.m. shooting Tuesday in suburban Arleta,
20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, police Officer Sidney
Benaske said.
   Sterling was released without being booked, but the case was
handed over to the district attorney's office for possible
misdemeanor charges of cruelty to animals or discharging a weapon
in city limits, Benaske said.
   Sterling was on his rounds when he allegedly shot Skippy with a
22-caliber weapon from the driveway while the dog was about 15 feet
away on the sidewalk, police said.
   Ms. Brody said she had just stepped to the door to give the
letter carrier a bottle of vodka tied with a green bow.
   Sterling, a letter carrier in the neighborhood for about four
years, told police he had been bitten by Skippy and had complained
about the animal to postal officials, Benaske said.
   But Ms. Brody said Sterling had gotten along well with the dog.
   ``He was a very friendly dog. The mailman knows him _ he watched
him grow. I don't know why he would do that (shoot the dog). He's a
very nice man,'' she said.
   Postal officials said the matter was under investigation.

   More countries today joined the major powers in
recognizing Romania's new government, and millions of dollars in
medical supplies and food were pledged to help the country recover
from its bloody revolution.
   More than 20 countries have recognized Romania's provisional
National Salvation Committee, which took charge Friday when the
popular revolt toppled President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   China, which violently crushed a pro-democracy movement in the
spring, today congratulated Romania's new leaders. Ceausescu was
one of the only world leaders to support China's crackdown.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave his personal support
to Ion Iliescu, the chief of Romania's new provisional government
and an acquantance from their college days.
   Japan said it would send $1 million following an appeal by the
International Committee of the Red Cross for $4 million in medical
relief.
   The Japanese Red Cross Society sent medical supplies worth about
$700,000 to Romania and committed a six-member medical team to help
the wounded.
   The Irish Red Cross said today that it would send eight tons of
medical supplies, food and equipment, and it began a fund-raising
campaign to match a cash donation of about $43,000 promised by the
Irish government.
   An Israeli military spokesman said a plane loaded with six to
eight tons of medicine, bandages and equipment and two
Romanian-speaking surgeons left for Bucharest today.
   France said its post office would send free aid packages to any
``identified recipient'' in Romania until January. In a separate
statement, the government said that besides two planeloads of
medical aid sent Saturday, about 20 planeloads had been sent by
non-governmental organizations, including 100 tons of medical
supplies and 60 doctors and nurses.
   The Bush administration said Tuesday it was providing $500,000
to buy medical supplies.
   A score of countries including the United States and the Soviet
Union recognized Romania's provisional government over the past
several days and more joined in today.
   Israel formally announced its support for the new Romanian
leaders and condemned the mass slayings by forces allied with
Ceausescu.
   The statement by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to Parliament was
the first time Israel openly criticized Ceausescu, who had been
highly regarded in Israel for maintaining a longstanding alliance
with the Jewish state.
   Gorbachev's contratulatory message was carried in the government
daily Izvestia and was strikingly informal, signed simply M.
Gorbachev, with no title. Accenting the unusual recognition of an
informal government was a shorter announcement immediately below,
signed by the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R., congratulating
Petre Roman on becoming the Romanian prime minister.
   Denmark sent a congratulatory telegram to Romania's newly
appointed leader, Ion Iliescu, said Hans Henrik Brunn of the
Foreign Ministry.
   In Zambia, President Kenneth Kaunda ``prayed that ongoing
changes will be without further loss of life,'' the official Zambia
News Agency reported.
   Assistant Secretary General Adnan Amran of the Arab League was
quoted as telling Abu Dhabi's state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad that
the changes in Romania were ``respected by all Arab states because
they express the will of the Romanian people.''
   Czechoslovakia's Communist daily Rude Pravo said the Cabinet
recognized Romania's National Salvation Committee on Saturday and
praised the army's decision to support the people.
   The United States was among several countries that criticized
the new government for trying and executing the Ceausescus in
secret.
   Today, Japan's liberal Asahi Shimbun daily newspaper said the
actions violated democratic principles.
   ``Granted, though, that the couple had committed great crimes,
it remained a categorical imperative of democracy to go through the
legitimate legal procedure and give the verdict of guilty,'' it
said.
   Egypt today also criticized the secret trial while supporting
the new Romanian government.
   London's Conservative Daily Mail newspaper said the criticisms
``come easy from the comfort of Western armchairs.''
   ``Such advice takes little account of the necessities imposed by
a civil war. ... While Ceausescu stayed alive, his Securitate
(secret police) had every incentive to carry on fighting and
killing in the hope of restoring him to power,'' the paper said.
   The British government has said it regretted the trial and
killings.
   Iolanda Stranescu, president of the British Romania Association,
said Ceausescu should have had a public trial.
   ``It is difficult at this range to know all the reasons for the
execution. Maybe it was security. Perhaps at a public trial too
much information might have come out about people who want to be
involved in the new government,'' Stranescu said.
   The Kuwait Times said Ceausescu deserved more time to answer the
charges against him.
   ``Those who tried the deposed head of state have proved
themselves overefficient in their performance. They seem to have
handed down a preordained death verdict to the accused without
judging its merit under the accepted canons of justice,'' it said.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Claims Rockwell Sought Information on Whistleblowers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. obtained
confidential files about industry whistleblowers during a fraud
investigation, documents filed by an aerospace worker in U.S.
District Court allege.
   The documents claim that Rockwell officials sought information
on aerospace workers who complained of alleged fraud and safety
problems in the space shuttle program, The Houston Post reported
Tuesday.
   Rockwell has denied the allegations in filings in the lawsuit.
The company has no further comment because the litigation is
pending, spokeswoman Janet Dean said at the corporation's
headquarters in El Segundo, Calif.
   The lawsuit claims Rockwell used information it collected _ and
some of the law enforcement agencies that provided it _ in a
campaign of intimidation against whistleblowers that began after
the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   ``It is just beyond my wildest beliefs,'' said Ria Solomon, who
contends in her lawsuit that Rockwell stepped up a pattern of
harassment after she filed a civil rights lawsuit against the
company. ``Something like this should not happen in America,'' she
told the Post.
   Rockwell obtained information ranging from court documents and
police reports open to the public to personal data and criminal
histories kept on a computer network reserved for law enforcement
agencies, the court documents allege.
   Ms. Solomon said she and her mother received threatening
telephone calls and that phone lines and an electrical fuse box at
her home were destroyed after she reported illegalities in the
shuttle program.
   The court documents filed included depositions from other
whistleblowing employees.
   Ms. Solomon claims she lost her job at Unisys Corp. in 1987
because she objected to fraud and safety violations that could
endanger a space shuttle crew.
   Unisys, a subcontractor for Rockwell Space Operations Co., a
Houston-based subsidiary of Rockwell International, is responsible
for developing and distributing computer software for the shuttle
program. Rockwell is the primary contractor for the shuttle
construction.
   Ms. Solomon reached an undisclosed, out-of-court settlement with
Unisys and four Unisys employees. The suit remains against
Rockwell, RSOC and two RSOC security officials, James Roberts and
Danny T. Myers.

   Chinese leaders today congratulated the new
leaders of Romania and expressed hope for good relations between
the countries.
   China on Tuesday effectively recognized the provisional
government that overthrew and executed President Nicolae Ceausescu
of Romania.
   Ceausescu was one of the few world leaders to praise China's
military crackdown of a pro-democracy movement in the spring, in
which hundreds and possibly thousands of people died.
   Thousands of people were killed in Romania last week after
Ceausescu deployed the military to crush anti-government
protesters. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed Christmas
Day.
   China's official press failed to report Ceausescu's overthrow
for more than a day, and it has since depicted the turmoil as a
struggle between pro- and anti-Ceausescu forces. It has provided
details of Ceausescu's execution and the establishment of a new
government but has not mentioned the extent of the popular uprising
or the depth of popular hatred for Ceausescu and his family.
   Chinese President Yang Shangkun, in a message to Ion Iliescu,
chairman of Romania's governing National Salvation Committee, said:
``On behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and
in the name of myself, I congratulate you on your election as
chairman.''
   ``May the friendship between the people of China and Romania and
the friendly relations between the two countries continue to
develop,'' he added.
   Premier Li Peng sent a similar message to Romania's new premier,
Petre Roman.
   The Foreign Ministry said it would not interfere in Romania's
internal affairs and respects the choice made by the Romanian
people.

   Heating oil futures jumped higher again today in
early trading, continuing the trend that accelerated after a
weekend explosion at the nation's second-largest petrochemical
plant.
   Heating oil futures prices had surged Tuesday in the wake of the
blast at the Exxon Corp. refinery at Baton Rouge, La. The accident
at the plant, which normally produces about 4.4 million gallons of
heating oil daily, aggravated a price spike caused by the
record-setting cold snap that has hit much of the nation and raised
the prospect of further spot oil shortages.
   The explosion Christmas Eve killed two people and shattered
windows in buildings as far as six miles away. The second body was
recovered Tuesday. An investigation has yet to determine the cause
of the blast.
   Supplies of home heating oil already were tight before the
explosion and the accelerated demand has pushed retail prices as
high as $1 a gallon in some areas.
   Wholesale prices also have surged, as reflected by the futures
market. Heating oil for January delivery, up 10.74 cents on
Tuesday, jumped another 4.02 cents to 96.50 cents a gallon in early
trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures also rose, adding to gains made
Tuesday in thin trading. Markets were closed Monday for Christmas.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude oil, was up 5 cents at $21.96 a barrel in early trading,
following Tuesday's 62-cent rise. Unleaded regular gasoline for
January, up 5.49 cents on Tuesday, rose 0.06 cent to 61 cents a
gallon in early trading today.
   ``There's no stopping prices for the short term until the
temperatures warm up,'' said Dillard Spriggs, president of
Petroleum Analysis Ltd. in New York.
   Exxon, Mobil Corp. and Star Enterprise, a Texaco Inc. affiliate,
reported last week that some of their terminals in the Northeast
suffered temporary oil shortages and customers were sent to other
suppliers or forced to wait for new shipments.
   On Tuesday, Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri said further
information on the shortages was unavailable. Mobil's offices were
closed for the holiday and telephone calls went unanswered.
   Exxon spokesman Jim Davis in Houston said the company wouldn't
have any problems supplying contract volumes of heating oil to
customers. ``There is some flexibility in the network,'' he said.
   The company has about a week before supplies become a problem,
Davis said, noting that Exxon can increase heating oil production
at its refineries in Baytown, Texas, and Linden, N.J. Davis said it
was impossible to predict when the Baton Rouge refinery would begin
operating normally again.
   He said the crippled plant made a large heating oil shipment to
the East Coast on Saturday and hadn't planned to supply the region
again until after Jan. 1.
   But oil traders appeared skeptical.
   ``The market's factoring in a lot more than that,'' said Peter
Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures
Inc.
   The futures market is betting it will take Exxon five days or
more to get the Baton Rouge refinery operating normally again,
Beutel said.

   Thousands of people across the South were left without water or
found their taps producing a trickle too weak for a decent shower
because the Christmas weekend freeze cracked pipes.
   Texas plumbers called for out-of-state reinforcements, hotels
with water offered special rates to folks desperate to bathe, and
the National Guard trucked water in to Pollock, La.
   ``It's unbelievable, unbelievable,'' said Bennie Payne, who was
busy dispatching plumbers from his Central Plumb It Yourself Supply
in Baton Rouge, La. ``Our guys are working till they drop. I don't
know how much longer they can keep up this pace.''
   However, in one of the hardest hit cities, Jackson, Miss.,
officials said today that they were making rapid progress toward
fixing the broken pipes and restoring normal service.
   From Dallas to Raleigh, N.C., a strange sort of spring thaw
followed the rare weekend freeze: Pipes, unprotected from the cold,
cracked open as freezing water expanded, then began dripping and
gushing as temperatures rose Monday and Tuesday.
   The worst of the South's cold wave appeared over, with the
National Weather Service predicting lows today at or above freezing
in much of the region and rising to the 50s and 60s today and
Thursday.
   Elsewhere, freezing rain was forecast today across the Plains
and light snow from the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley east into West
Virginia, western Pennsylvania and New York state and into New
England.
   The wintry weather has been blamed for the deaths of 97 people
since Dec. 15.
   The cold destroyed much of Florida's valuable citrus crop and
froze an estimated 65 percent of Texas' oranges and grapefruit on
the trees.
   Louisiana fishermen were astounded to see ice in the shallows
where they earn their living.
   ``We have banks that are solid white with fish and frozen fish
floating everywhere,'' said Joe Buras, president of the Delta
Commercial Fishermen's Association of Plaquemines Parish. ``We have
islands with ice sticking 2 or 3 feet high and bays that are frozen
solid.
   ``It looks like Alaska it's so bad right now.''
   Particularly hard-hit with water problems were Jackson, with an
estimated 60,000 homes and businesses left dry, and Houston, where
one official guessed the number affected may have topped 100,000.
   Jackson officials asked laundries, car washes and other
businesses that use large amounts of water to stay closed a second
day today, and non-essential government workers were ordered to
stay home.
   Residents who had water were warned to boil it for three minutes
to kill germs that are a threat when levels are low. Low pressure
also hampered firefighters' in battling blazes.
   However, Mayor Kane Ditto said today that conditions were
quickly returning to normal.
   ``We are in much better shape this morning,'' Ditto said on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``We suspect that about 20 percent
of the homes might now be out of water and hopefully those will be
back up sometime during the day.''
   Ditto said 10 crews were restoring service to the remainder of
150 major breaks reported since Saturday.
   Houston residents hankering for showers were obliged _ at
$25-a-douse _ in the downtown Holiday Inn and the Ramada Inn near
the Astrodome.
   Low pressure plagued much of the city and homeowners found
waiting lists as long as two weeks for plumbers.
   The John Moore Plumbing Co., with a backlog of 2,000 trouble
calls, was recruiting out-of-state plumbers to bolster its staff of
28, said Shirley Kurtz, sales manager.
   Plumbing breaks also caused problems in places including Dallas,
Baton Rouge, Mobile, Ala., Meridian, Miss., Charleston, S.C., and
Raleigh.
   In West Ashley, S.C., Linda Singletary said her water pressure
was so low it took 45 minutes to run a sinkful to wash the dishes.
   ``The shower, you can't soap yourself down because it wauld take
you three hours to get the soap off,'' Ms. Singletary said.
``Washing your hair is out of the question.''
   More serious problems abounded.
   Four National Guard trucks from Camp Beauregard, La., hauled
6,000-gallon water trailers to the desperately dry town of Pollock.
   Water gushing from broken pipes ruined 240,000 pounds of food
intended for distribution to the needy, said Ron Prado, director of
the Bay Area Food Bank.
   Cold-caused property damage in the Dallas area, most of it from
broken pipes, could total $25 million, an insurance industry group
predicted.
   Among Dallas businesses with water damage was The Hard Rock
Cafe, where a pipe broke, pumping 900,000 gallons of water into the
basement Christmas Day.
   ``We lost all our food, computers and amplifiers,'' said
assistant general manager Rob Perez. ``It was pretty brutal.''

<TEXT>
   Walter Doane ``Bo'' Randall, renowned as
one of the world's best knife makers, is dead at age 80.
   Randall, who began hand-crafting hunting knives half a century
ago as a hobby, had an eight-man factory in Orlando that turned out
knives favored by the Army's Special Forces and military men and
civilians in many countries.
   Randall knives are displayed in the Smithsonian Institution and
the Museum of Special Warfare at Fort Bragg, N.C.
   Each Randall blade is made of ``the best high-carbon steel,
forged, ground, tempered and fitted to the hilt entirely by hand,''
said Harper's Magazine years ago.
   ``Although the demand is heavy _ his shop often has to backlog
orders for more than a year _ nobody has ever tried to compete with
him by mass-production methods.''
   The knife-collector's bible, American Knives, referred to
Randall as the world's greatest blade maker.
   Randall, born in Cincinnati, died Monday.
   Survivors include his wife Ruth, a son, two daughters, a brother
and 10 grandchildren.

   Three bodies were found this morning in
the wreckage of a small airplane that crashed in a rural section of
southern New Jersey, state police spokesman Daniel Cosgrove said.
   The Cessna 172 was spotted at 7:50 a.m. in the Wharton State
Forest.
   The plane had taken off from Teterboro Airport in northern New
Jersey on Monday night, headed to Norfolk, Va., and then to the
Bahamas, according to Maj. Andrew Pantelides of the New Jersey
Civil Air Patrol.
   The Cessna was traveling with two other planes that landed
safely in Atlantic City, Pantelides said. He said passengers aboard
those planes became concerned after the Cessna did not arrive and a
search began that night.
   Seven aircraft and about 65 rescue workers searched a 50 mile
area between Toms River and Atlantic City until the aircraft was
found this morning in Burlington County, Pantelides said.
   The names of the dead were not immediately released.

   When American wounded began arriving last
week from Panama, Maj. Nelson Smith and hospital staff quickly
realized that the injured soldiers' families were going to need
help, too.
   ``The military does things differently than other people do,''
Smith observed Tuesday. For the families of the wounded,
particularly those unfamiliar with the military bureaucracy, ``it
was something of a culture shock,'' he said.
   For instance, families had to apply for identification badges
before seeing their loved ones, and could not visit them without an
escort.
   ``We're more structured to protect the privacy of the patient
than a civilian hospital,'' said Smith, a clinical social worker.
   Smith, the chairman of the social work department at Wilford
Hall Medical Center, and others established a reception center to
help the visiting families deal with wounds and injuries to their
sons and husbands.
   About 250 wounded soldiers have been treated at Wilford and
Brooke Army Medical Center since the United States invaded Panama
last week.
   Many soldiers have been released or transferred to their home
bases. Tuesday marked the first day in a week that military
hospitals did not receive wounded soldiers from Panama, and today
there were 41 soldiers at Wilford Hall and 17 across town at Brooke
Army Medical Center.
   President Bush will visit the wounded soldiers Sunday, the White
House said.
   Smith, 42, said the sight of loved ones being reunited with
those wounded in Panama recalled the return of American hostages
from Iran in January 1981.
   Smith was assigned to the U.S. hospital in Wiesbaden, West
Germany, where the newly freed hostages were taken for observation
and treatment before returning to the United States.
   Both the hostages returning from Iran and the soldiers wounded
in Panama were very emotional. ``It was the same sense of relief
that they had survived,'' Smith said.
   He said the soldiers from Panama and the hostages behaved
similarly, concentrating on televised news accounts of the event of
which they were part.
   Smith said the hospital and volunteers have been working hard to
help families of casualties through reception centers staffed by a
clinical social workers and two mental health technicians.
   He said the first thing family members want to do is to see
their loved ones. Regardless of the wound or injury, Smith said,
relatives must be accompanied by a hospital staff person or
volunteer during that initial encounter to give them whatever
emotional support they may need.
   ``We don't let them go up by themselves,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan government will not
allow a U.S. plane carrying supplies for its embassy to land as
scheduled next month, the official newspaper Barricada reported
today.
   Barricada, the organ of the ruling Sandinista Front, said the
monthly flight that supplies the U.S. Embassy is scheduled to
arrive Jan. 11.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto informed U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III on Tuesday night that the measure was
taken because U.S. forces would not allow Nicaraguan planes to land
in Panama and had surrounded the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama City,
Barricada said.
   Civil aviation was halted in Panama when U.S. forces invaded
last week to oust dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. U.S. troops
later surrounded the Nicaraguan, Cuban and Libyan embassies to
prevent Noriega from seeking refuge there. Noriega chose instead to
seek refuge in the Vatican embassy.
   Last week, Nicaraguan troops surrounded the U.S. Embassy in
Managua in response to the blockade of the Nicaraguan Embassy in
Panama.
   Barricada said about 165 Nicaraguans and two Aeronica planes
have been trapped in Panama since the Dec. 20 invasion.
   It quoted the Foreign Ministry as demanding that the Nicaraguans
and the Nicaraguan planes be permitted to leave today and said the
U.S. supply plane would not be allowed to land before Jan. 26 if
the demands were not met.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Lou Falino, contacted by telephone, said
he had no comment on the matter.

   A weakening Typhoon Jack began to drift
toward this U.S. territory in the western Pacific today and was
forecast to at least brush the island on Friday, according to civil
defense officials.
   At 1 a.m. Thursday, (10 a.m. today EST), the storm was 190 miles
east of Guam, moving west-southwest at about 3 mph. Its sustained
wind speed was 85 mph with gusts to 100 mph. On Tuesday, its
sustained winds were 135.
   Lt. Richard Bouchard of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center here
said at the rate the storm was weakening it could lose typhoon
status _ sustained wind speed of at least 74 mph _ before it passes
south of Guam.
   ``Forecasters can't determine how close it will come, but it's
expected to pass Guam during the day Friday,'' said George Toves, a
Guam Civil Defense officer. ``We'll get some portion of it.''
   The storm had been stalled about 200 miles east of Guam since
early Tuesday.

<HEAD>Guilty Plea of Marijuana Broker Caps Sting Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man prosecutors called the biggest single
broker of Southeast Asian marijuana pleaded guilty to smuggling
nearly 200 tons into the United States over a four-year period.
   Brian Peter Daniels, 43, appeared before U.S. District Judge
John Coughenour on Tuesday to plead guilty to one count of
operating a continuing criminal enterprise and two counts of
conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana.
   Daniels, a New York native who had lived in Thailand for about
10 years until his 1988 arrest in Switzerland, could be sentenced
to life in prison and fined up to $6.25 million.
   Sentencing was set for May 25. Daniels is being held without
bail in the Pierce County Jail.
   Daniels admitted in court documents that he masterminded some of
the biggest marijuana shipments from Southeast Asia to the United
States from 1984 to 1988.
   The shipments included multiton deliveries to Seattle, southern
California, Oregon, Nevada, British Columbia and Mexico. Among them
was the shipment of 72 tons of high-grade Laotian marijuana seized
in June 1988 aboard the Encounter Bay, an oil-supply vessel, off
the Washington coast.
   ``As far as I'm aware he was the single biggest broker of
Southeast Asian marijuana,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter
Mueller.
   The guilty plea was part of an agreement in which some charges
in Seattle, San Diego, and Reno, Nev., were packaged into a single
plea agreement filed in Seattle.
   The guilty plea capped a ``sting'' operation by the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration, in which DEA agents in Seattle, Reno,
Miami, Hong Kong and Bangkok collaborated to ensnare Daniels.
   Dozens of other defendants have been prosecuted in Seattle, San
Diego and Reno and arrest warrants have been issued for other key
figures who are still fugitives.
   Swiss police and DEA agents arrested Daniels in July 1988 in
Zurich, Switzerland, where he had gone for medical treatment.

   The Justice Department today asked authorities
in four European countries to freeze bank accounts where it
believes ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega stashed
millions of dollars in illegal drug profits.
   ``We have taken steps today in four European countries to freeze
assets in numerous'' accounts, said David Runkel, the department's
chief spokesman. Officials say Noriega hid at least $10 million in
the accounts.
   As the department sought to gain control of Noriega's money,
U.S. officials in Panama and Washington negotiated with the
Vatican, whose embassy in Panama City took in an exhausted Noriega
and 10 associates sought asylum Sunday. Noriega's regime was
toppled on Dec. 20 by U.S. troops.
   U.S. officials sent letters to authorities in Switzerland,
France, Luxembourg and Britain asking them to halt transactions in
the bank accounts belonging to the deposed Panamanian dictator,
Runkel said.
   The actions were taken under international treaty agreements
that the United States has with the foreign nations, he said.
   Based on records seized in Panama, which was invaded by U.S.
troops on Dec. 20, U.S. officials believe they can document that
the money in the overseas accounts stemmed from Noriega's alleged
drug dealing, Runkel said.
   ``We will have to demonstrate to the banking officials'' that
the money was earned illegally, he added. He said ``preliminary
discussions'' were under way with other countries where Noriega has
money.
   While the Justice Department is trying to freeze $10 million,
the State Department estimates Noriega's worth at about $200
million to $300 million.
   In a speech last August, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger alluded to multimillion-dollar transactions Noriega has
made over the past two years involving accounts in West Germany,
Switzerland and Luxembourg.
   Justice attorneys are confident that banking officials in the
four European countries will cooperate with their request. ``We've
had a remarkable display of international cooperation,'' Runkel
said.
   But he added there is a possibility that Noriega, his family or
his bankers have already transferred the money out of the accounts
since the U.S. invasion.
   Freezing the accounts if the first step in a process to seize
the assets, Runkel said. Distribution of the money, however, would
be governed by the laws of the countries where the cash is hidden.
   President Bush, meanwhile, told reporters today he did not think
that he or the U.S. government would be embarrassed if information
about Noriega's past links to the CIA came out during a trial of
the Panamanian.
   ``I think that's history and I think the main thing is he should
be tried and brought to justice,'' Bush said in Corpus Christi,
Texas. ``And we are pursuing that course with no fear of that.
   ``You know, you may get into some release of certain
confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole
justice process. But the system works, so I wouldn't worry about
that.''
   President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said earlier that
Noriega can talk ``until he's blue in the face'' about his links
with Bush and the CIA.
   The spokesman was referring to things Noriega might reveal about
his past close ties with the U.S. government, including the period
in the 1970s when Bush headed the CIA. ``It won't hurt anything,''
Fitzwater added.
   ``We want Noriega here because he would cause trouble wherever
he goes ... We want him in a nice jail cell where we can keep an
eye on him,'' Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air Force One en
route with Bush to a fishing and hunting vacation in Texas.
   In Panama City, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern
Command, met face-to-face three times with Monsignor Sebastian
Laboa, the papal nuncio, on the street outside the embassy.
   Less public diplomatic channels also were used to communicate
with the Vatican, though Bush has not contacted Pope John Paul II.
   While U.S. troops ringed the Vatican Embassy to block Noriega
from leaving, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney indicated the soldiers
could be in for a long wait.
   ``It could be that they'll (the Vatican) have a long-term
resident in their embassy in Panama City,'' he told ABC-TV.
   Cheney, along with national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed
Bush on the Panama situation at Camp David, Md., on Tuesday.
   The Vatican, which has no extradition treaty with the United
States, has refused to hand over Noriega to the United States.
Sources in Rome said the Vatican would rather turn Noriega over to
a third country, while another possibility is having Noriega stand
trial in Panama.
   Fitzwater said administration officials have not ruled out
various options, although the U.S. policy is that Noriega should be
brought to trial in the United States. Should the United States
receive custody of Noriega, he would be brought first to Miami for
an initial court appearance.
   Fitzwater said the United States would keep troops around the
Vatican embassy ``as long as he's there.''
   While U.S. officials rejected the idea that Noriega be given
political asylum, one expert said Noriega's fate is in the
Vatican's hands.
   ``Asylum in an embassy is well recognized,'' said John Lawrence
Hargrove, executive director of the American Society of
International Law. ``If the Vatican says he is entitled to asylum,
he is safe. The Latin Americans are especially strong on diplomatic
asylum.''
   Runkel said Noriega's claims to asylum are invalid because he
doesn't fit into the categories for which asylum is granted:
persecution on the grounds of religious or political beliefs.
   ``His fears are of prosecution in the United States on two
indictments.'' he said.
   Meantime, Cheney, who spent Christmas day in Panama, indicated
some of the 26,000 U.S. troops in the country could be brought back
sooner than expected because the situation is returning to normal.
He gave no timetable.
   Despite occasional sniping incidents, Cheney said the
``overwhelming sense is a return to normalcy.'' Cheney said the
``U.S. military did its job'' and now ``the lawyers and the
diplomats have to take over.''

<HEAD>Whale-Watching Season Begins This Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The best time of year to catch a glimpse of
migrating whales' slashing flukes and blowhole fountains begins
this week in Southern California with the arrival of the first of
20,000 Pacific gray whales.
   Whale-watching boat operators are gearing up for the peak season
that lures tourists and locals eager for a look at the whales that
swim 6,000 miles south for the winter.
   ``Many (whales) go out of their way to meet the boats to be
petted and touched,'' said Patricia Warhol of the American Cetacean
Society in San Pedro. ``They are curious about humans.''
   The whales' migration path from the Arctic Ocean to warmer
waters skirts the Aleutian Islands past British Columbia,
Washington, Oregon and California to shallow lagoons off Mexico's
Baja peninsula.
   The first whales, called front runners, are the expectant
females who arrive in Baja in late December, soon thereafter giving
birth and beginning to rear their young.
   Other adults and yearlings follow during a migration season that
runs through April.
   The whales, formerly called the California gray whales, were
listed as endangered animals in 1969 when their numbers were down
to about 3,000.
   But steps by the Mexican government to protect their breeding
grounds and other conservation efforts helped boost the gray whale
population.

   A photographer who led a fight to legalize
nudity on private property and spurred Kodak into returning
snapshots of naked subjects has been inducted into the Nudist Hall
of Fame.
   Ed Lange, 69, was ``utterly delighted'' with the American
Sunbathing Association's decision to place him on the 25-year-old
honors list, said Chris Moran, spokesman for the Elysium Fields
nude resort that Lange founded.
   ``It is a great honor from his perspective,'' Moran said
Tuesday. ``He has basically stuck his neck out for some 20 odd
years risking everything he had to prove a point _ that being
freedom of expression.''
   Lange was credited with persuading Eastman Kodak in the 1950s to
change its policy of refusing to return pictures of nude people
that were sent in for developing.
   Lange, whose photos have appeared in Time, Life, Vogue, and
Harper's Bazaar, opened Elysium Fields in Topanga, west of Los
Angeles, in 1967 and battled Los Angeles County to overturn its
anti-nudity law.
   In 1968, a judge ruled that the law prohibiting disrobing on
private property violated the right of self expression, free
association, due process and equal protection under the law.

<TEXT>
   Romania's new president today defended
the swiftness of Nicolae Ceausescu's trial and execution and said
there had been indications forces loyal to the ousted dictator
might try to free him.
   Pro-Ceausescu security police today attacked Bucharest
television headquarters, where the provisional government was
based, but were driven off by army units supporting the revolution.
   ``After a gunbattle of a half an hour, the army regained firm
control of the situation,'' Hungary's MTI news agency reported from
the scene.
   MTI said the army was in control of most of the capital but that
there were fears the security police would strike again.
   Overall, however, things appeared to be quiet, and businesses
and factories began resuming operations after the 12-day-long
revolt that ousted Ceausescu after 24 years of strict Communist
rule.
   The governing National Salvation Committee demanded that
security police surrender by Thursday and indicated they face the
same fate as Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, if they do not.
   The government set up military courts Tuesday to try members of
Ceausescu's vicious security police.
   Ion Iliescu, named president by the governing National Salvation
Committee, today defended the secrecy surrounding the Ceausescus'
trial and execution on Christmas Day.
   ``We are people carried away by a very spontaneous process. So
there was a general demand which pushed us to follow this
process,'' he told French television. He said the security police
could have tried to rescue Ceausescu.
   Romania's Agerpres news agency said Tuesday night that Romania's
interim leaders set up special military courts to try ``all cases
of terrorist acts'' and said sentences would be carried out
``immediately.''
   It said the interim government demanded all members of the
security police surrender by Thursday afternoon or they will be
``tried and condemned.''
   Romanian television Tuesday night showed the first videotape
footage of the trial of Ceausescu and his wife.
   ``Everything that was said here is false, and I don't want to
talk anymore,'' Ceausescu told his accusers, insisting he was still
in power and refusing to acknowledge either the severe hardships he
forced on his people or the massacre of thousands of people by his
security forces.
   Earlier in the day, state television showed pictures of the
bullet-riddled bodies of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, who was
second-in-command in Romania.
   Ceausescu, unrepentant right up until his execution, did not
tolerate even the mildest dissent in 24 years of rule, and many
Romanians are concerned that the bloody 12-day-old revolution that
toppled him will not lead to democracy.
   Iliescu, in a speech Tuesday night, stressed that the 37-member
National Salvation Committee intends to govern only until ``new
structures'' can be established under a new constitution.
   The leadership promised free elections in April, which would be
the first in Romania since 1937.
   The committee, comprised of dissidents, disaffected government
officials and army commanders, has run the short and bloody
revolution since taking over television headquarters Friday.
   Sporadic gunfire still rang out through parts of the capital
after proof of the execution was broadcast, but Bucharest radio and
Romanian sources said Ceausescu loyalists were surrendering by the
hundreds.
   Many buildings in Bucharest were burned out or pocked by the
thousands of bullets and shells fired in earlier battles between
the army _ which sided with the people _ and security forces
sniping from windows and rooftops.
   The provisional government appointed its leaders on Tuesday and
said it was repealing many hated laws that held Romanians in a
straitjacket of repression, including one that required the
registration of all typewriters.
   Some members of newly founded political parties demanded that
all Communists be excluded from the government.
   The committee said Iliescu, 59, a senior Communist official
until his demotion by Ceausescu, would remain chairman as well as
president. Petre Roman, a 43-year-old professor of hydroengineering
with no political background, was named prime minister.
   In one of the government's first acts, Iliescu and Defense
Minister Gen. Nicolae Militaru ordered the dreaded state security
department placed under the jurisdiction of the defense agency,
leaving only traffic police, firefighters and prison guards under
the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry.
   Other decrees repealed laws forbidding unauthorized contact with
foreigners and requiring the intelligentsia to live in the same
city where they work _ a statute frequently used to banish critical
voices to remote towns.
   ``What we have achieved so far is to solve only emergency
problems,'' Prime Minister Roman told the Soviet television news
program ``Vremya.''
   ``The questions I'll be dealing with are connected with
restoration of the economy under new conditions.''
   In a late night television address reported by Agerpres, Roman
said his new government would be formed ``quite soon.''
   ``We are not in a desparate situation,'' he was quoted as
saying. But he noted that ``the Ceausescu clique'' left the economy
a ``disaster.''
   ``The economy and social organization were ... at (the) beck and
call of two primitive minds, with no perspective, but with the
thirst for power,'' Roman said of the Ceausescus.
   At his trial, the 71-year-old Ceausescu lashed out at his
accusers as the charges were read against him and refused to reply
when asked who ordered that demonstrators be shot on Dec. 17 in the
western city of Timisoara, where the revolt began.
   ``This was a coup d'etat, and I don't answer your questions,''
he said.
   The Ceausescus were convicted of killing more than 60,000 people
during their years in power, stashing more than $1 billion in
foreign banks and ruining the national heritage and economy.
   Romania's standard of living has plunged in recent years because
of Ceausescu's harsh campaign to pay off the foreign debt, which
included exporting the vast bulk of the nation's crops.
   A military officer who asked not to be identified said 300
soldiers volunteered for the firing squad to kill the former ruling
couple but only three were chosen. The Ceausescus' were granted
their last wish, to die together, the officer said.
   ``Down with tyranny!'' a radio announcer proclaimed after the
executions. ``Romania is free ... the supreme moment has come.''
   For some, death was not enough.
   ``He should be stripped naked, and his body paraded through the
streets,'' said Dimitru Minca, 70, whose 14-year-old grandson was
among those killed in the unrest.
   The Ceausescus were reportedly captured in an underground bunker
after fleeing the capital in a helicopter. Their son and daughter,
Nicu and Zoia, and other family members were arrested and
reportedly face trial.

   Violent crimes and factional
fighting over the four-day Christmas weekend left 69 people dead,
almost all of them black, police said Wednesday.
   Police said 38 people were stabbed, beaten or shot to death in
and around Cape Town over the holiday period, which included
Tuesday. One of those killed was a black policeman shot with his
own gun after he was attacked by two men who lived with him.
   Also, police reported 24 murders and 24 rapes from Saturday
through Tuesday in Soweto, the black township of 2.5 million people
outside Johannesburg.
   The police unrest summaries for the period listed an additional
seven deaths. The latest report, released Wednesday, said a black
policemen was killed in an attack near the port city of Durban and
a black man and a black women burned to death when their hut was
set alight near the southern town of Port Shepstone, the report
added.
   Authorities also said more than 90 people were killed in traffic
accidents from Friday night through Tuesday.

   Warren (Ohio) Tribune-Chronicle on the Panama invasion:
   We can find plenty of reasons for wishing President George Bush
had not invaded Panama Wednesday to oust dictator Manuel Noriega.
Furthermore, Bush pulled the trigger on what, at first glance,
looks like flimsy pretexts.
   Noreiga did virtually declare war with the United States Friday,
and his actions in the next few days were troubling. But, while we
do not mean to belittle anyone's life, only one U.S. citizen was
killed before the invasion. ...
   And while Wednesday's well-orchestrated events began with the
swearing-in of a democratic government, our invasion made it our
government, in a sense our puppet. And yet, deep inside, we have a
gut feeling that justice just might have been served. ...
   We should be humble and perhaps even a little ashamed we had to
resort to violence. But Noriega by all accounts did deserve to be
ousted and should be brought to trial. In that light, perhaps a
more apt comparison than the invasion of Czechoslovakia may be the
killing in Romania. Would we protest if Soviet President Gorbachev
invaded Romania to put a stop to the killing there?

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on the Panama invasion:
   President Bush's decision to invade Panama, we're certain, will
be well received by the American people. His popularity rating will
shoot upward.
   This is the president who has been criticized for being too
cautious and too prudent _ a wimp, some have called him. Now he's
playing Rambo.
   Few nations are applauding. U.S. might does not necessarily mean
right, despite the fact that Noriega was a disreputable dictator
who pushed his luck too far and who should have been dumped.
   But many Americans do not properly appreciate the sensitivity of
the Latin Americans to intervention by Uncle Sam. The Latins have a
name for it _ gunboat diplomacy.
   The United States has no legal or moral right to intervene in
the affairs of independent nations.
   ... In this case, Noriega made it easy for Bush.
   In retrospect, we wonder why our government made it so hard for
Noriega to step down peaceably. Why did we insist that he be tried
on drug charges? ... We should have eased him out, cajoled and
persuaded him to resign, then slipped him away to exile.

   The Birmingham (Ala.) News on the Panama invasion:
   Panama may have lost a tinhorn dictator last week, but in the
near future it will gain about $375 million in assets and
multi-millions more in back taxes from U.S. companies.
   Looks like a pretty good swap from here.
   The United States cut off all military and economic aid to
Panama in July 1987 in an attempt to force Manuel Noriega from
power.
   Further sanctions sharply restricted U.S. companies that do
business in Panama, froze Panamanian assets held in the United
States, held payments relating to operating the Panama Canal in
escrow and forbade American companies from paying taxes and fees to
the Noriega regime.
   But those sanctions probably hurt the poor people of Panama more
than Noriega.

   The Tulsa (Okla.) Tribune on the Panama invasion:
   The Bush administration will make a tactical error if it insists
that Gen. Noriega, now sequestered in the quarters of the Vatican's
apostolic nuncio, be turned directly over to U.S. soldiers
surrounding the property.
   Let us not forget that the No. 1 objective was not to capture a
man wanted on criminal charges but to oust a bloody and corrupt
dictator.
   Noriega is such an opprobrious character that it would be
foolish to give him a chance to play the martyr. By demanding that
the Vatican shove him out the door into the hands of what is, in
fact, an invading army we would raise again all the anger, latent,
at best, in Latin America, over the colossus of the North.
   It would be far better to allow the Vatican, which wants nothing
of this red hot potato, to hand him over to whatever passes for the
military forces in Panama not under control of Noriega officers.

   Los Angeles Times on the Panama invasion:
   By surrendering to Vatican diplomats on Christmas Eve, former
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega saved himself, at least
temporarily, from the U.S. military forces that ousted him. ...
even if Noriega evaded the U.S. government again, he still stands
deposed and discredited _ and that's an important victory.
   ... The Holy See may give him to the new civilian government in
Panama, which also wants to put Noriega on trial. Or it may
negotiate Noriega's departure to a third country like Cuba. But,
frankly, now that Noriega's come to a pathetic end, he's no longer
of any real concern. There are far more important tasks facing the
United States in Panama. ... Getting U.S. forces out of the country
as quickly as possible. ... Helping Panama's new civilian
government build the genuine democracy that has never had a chance
to develop in that country. ... Rebuilding Panama's badly-damaged
economy.

   The Spokane (Wash.) Chronicle on nuclear plant safety:
   Officials at U.S. nuclear weapons plants say the knowing
disregard for worker safety that prevailed 30 to 40 years ago would
not occur today.
   Americans in general, and weapons plant workers in particular,
can hope that's true. They may never feel completely confident it's
true, though, given the evidence that weapons-production pressures
have taken precedence over worker safety for virtually the entire
history of U.S. nuclear weapons production. ...
   Congress is in the process of providing funds for a new
generation of nuclear weapons plants. So dramatic are the trends in
superpower relations that even the most prudent observers rightly
can ask how much production capacity is required. Some such
capacity, however, will be required _ if only to recycle old
warheads to glean the materials for a much smaller deterrent force.
   Given that need for a new generation of weapons plants, Congress
must see to it that those new plants are operated safely. The means
to that end, not yet achieved, is a management structure severing
safety obligations from production responsibilities and making the
latter subordinate to the former.

   The Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Gazette on Mississippi River pollution:
   Abuse and indifference finally have caught up with the
Mississippi River. It probably shouldn't have come as too great a
shock recently when the environmental group Greenpeace pronounced
``the father of waters'' a ``soup of toxic chemicals.''...
   Iowa's contribution to the pollution is varied, although the
greatest portion comes from agricultural pesticide runoff.
Startling quantities are involved: It has been determined, for
example, that 112,000 pounds of the chemical Alachlor flows past a
test site in Louisiana each year.
   The Greenpeace report pointed a finger at specific industries,
as well, claiming they are discharging ``metals, solvents,
cancer-causing hydrocarbons,'' and assorted other toxins into the
Mississippi at Clinton, Muscatine and Riverdale. ...
   Any smugness we middle Americans may have felt toward our
countrymen in the sooty, grimy reaches of New York or California
with their debris-infested beaches is misplaced until we get to
work cleaning up after ourselves.

   The Omaha (Neb.) World-Herald on the Soviets and NATO:
   After years of hating the NATO alliance and trying to weaken it,
the Kremlin now apparently sees NATO as a way of keeping Germany
from attempting to capitalize on Soviet weakness.
   American diplomats have pointed to the Warsaw Pact as a
stabilizing infuence as Eastern Europe undergoes what amounts to a
democratic revolution. Shevardnadze has made a similar point
regarding the American presence. The two Germanys are not likely to
go wobbling off on a disturbing political or military course if
Soviet and American troops are still present in the heart of Europe.
   Reducing those troops to more reasonable levels is now the work
of the Soviet-American arms negotiators in Geneva. The job should
be easier because the Soviets finally admit that the Americans are
in Europe to keep the peace, not to start another war.

   The Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader:
   Under the terms of his new contract, Kirby Puckett of the
Minnesota Twins will make more in a month than President Bush will
make in a year.
   The star outfielder will make more in a month than (South
Dakota) Gov. George Mickelson will for his entire four-year term.
   At $9 million for three years, Puckett will average $250,000 a
month. And he isn't even the highest paid player in major league
baseball.
   Lately, baseball players have been grabbing the spotlight. They
have been the beneficiaries of a spectacular, new boom in salaries.
The players have shown that they can overpower team owners at the
bargaining table, as well as on the field.
   The new salary structure is almost sickening. It reflects a
skewed system of public values that has actually been in place for
decades. Don't blame the modern players for taking what they can
get. That's how free enterprise works.
   If you like, blame the owners, who publicly plead poverty, and
then get into multimillion-dollar bidding wars for mediocre
pitchers and .225 hitters.
   Mostly, though, blame those of us who are silly enough to keep
going to games, keep watching them on television, keep reading
about them and otherwise keep caring.

   A work crew Christmas weekend was
assigned to do nothing but flush the 503 toilets at the Gator Bowl
to prevent a freeze-up at the stadium before the annual New Year's
college football game.
   A freeze in 1983 caused about $400,000 damage in broken water
pipes, so when record cold headed for town last week, officials
hired a crack brigade of toilet flushers to keep water moving
through the plumbing.
   From dusk Friday until noon on Christmas, the 23-member crew
flushed toilets. Each person was responsible for an average of 21.8
toilets each.
   Everything went fine until a power outage shut down stadium
water pumps on Saturday and Sunday. The stadium sustained about
$5,000 damage to plumbing.
   ``When the pumps weren't working and the water pressure was bad,
there wasn't much you could do,'' said sports complex manager
Richard Fagan.

<TEXT>
   U.S. soldiers played loud rock music,
mowed the lawn and shot out street lights around the Vatican
Embassy today after hours of curbside diplomacy failed to break a
stalemate over the status of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said in Italy today there was
no legal way the Holy See could hand over Noriega to U.S.
authorities.
   President Bush said he would not give up efforts to gain custody
of the ousted dictator, who is wanted in the United States on drug
charges.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, asked authorities in
Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Britain to freeze bank accounts
in which Noriega is believed to have stashed millions of dollars in
illegal drug profits.
   Before dawn, a company of American soldiers paraded past the
Vatican Embassy, where Noriega sought refuge Christmas Eve, five
days after American troops invaded Panama in an effort to capture
him.
   American troops mowed down a field of tall grass alongside the
embassy overnight and shot out all working street lights with a
pellet gun.
   Later in the morning, some soldiers hooked up small olive-green
speakers in the parking lot of the nearby Holiday Inn and played
David Bowie's ``Modern Love'' album and other rock music at high
volume. The sound easily reached reporters in a 12th-floor room
overlooking the Vatican Embassy.
   Army Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, said he could not comment on why the troops might have
mowed the lawn and shot out street lights.
   The music appeared to relieve the tedium for some of the
soldiers, who have had to stand in the hot sun for hours wearing
heavy flak jackets.
   On Tuesday, U.S. soldiers searched the Vatican representative,
Monsignor Sebastian Laboa, and his car as he left the embassy,
apparently to prevent Noriega from being spirited out.
   After a week of fighting, order returned to Panama City. Crews
cleared mounds of garbage left from wild looting sprees that
emptied shelves, and many people returned to work.
   The U.S. military reported only scattered clashes with Noriega
loyalists Tuesday. A few members of his Defense Forces were
arrested and many surrendered.
   On the third day of negotiations over Noriega's fate, Gen.
Maxwell Thurman, who commands U.S. forces in Central and South
America, posted himself outside the Vatican Embassy for nearly six
hours Tuesday afternoon.
   He met three times with Laboa in the street and spent the rest
of the time waiting in a car, one of a caravan of sedans, jeeps and
armored personnel carriers that escorted him to the mission.
   Neither Thurman nor other U.S. officials would comment on the
negotiations.
   At the Vatican, Navarro told reporters the Holy See could not
legally give Noriega to U.S. officials because the embassy is
empowered to deal only with the Panamanian government. He said
Panama's U.S.-backed civilian government had not made any request
for Noriega.
   Navarro also said the Vatican had not spoken with other
countries about arranging exile for Noriega.
   The United States and the Vatican have no extradition treaty and
the Vatican criticized the bloody U.S. invasion that toppled the
general and installed the government of President Guillermo Endara,
who was elected in May in balloting Noriega nullified.
   Without an agreement, Noriega will not get past the U.S. troops
surrounding the Vatican mission. Under international law, embassies
are considered inviolable and U.S. troops cannot legally enter the
mission to get him.
   U.S. troops also surrounded the Cuban, Nicaraguan and Libyan
embassies, where it was thought Noriega might try to seek refuge.
In retaliation, Nicaragua announced today it will not permit a U.S.
plane carrying supplies to the U.S. Embassy in Managua to land next
month until the embassy standoff ends.
   Bush, speaking to reporters today in Texas, said he was
personally involved in trying to win custody of Noriega and had set
no time limit on negotiations.
   The U.S. Southern Command said Noriega probably went to the
Vatican mission on his own after his closest collaborators either
deserted him or were arrested.
   Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, considered one of Noriega's right-hand
men, pleaded innocent Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Miami to
drug smuggling charges.
   ``I surrendered myself _ I wanted to be brought here,'' he told
the court.
   He is charged with racketeering, drug smuggling and money
laundering in the same February 1988 indictment that names Noriega.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Del Cid was ``a liaison,
courier and emissary for Manuel Noriega, dealing wit drug
trafficking.''
   U.S. drug agents in Panama were scrutinizing thousands of
documents seized in raids on Noriega's houses and government
offices, including the headquarters of the Anti-Narcotics Special
Force.
   The information included files on foreigners entering and
leaving the country. A U.S. Drug Enforcment Administration agent,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some of the files were on
Colombian drug lords.
   In Panama City, U.S. troops continued to block some major
streets, adding to the usual traffic jams, and 15 tons of emergency
medical supplies arrived to help hospitals in need of blood,
surgical equipment and other basics.
   Since the invasion began, 23 Americans and 293 Panamanian
military have been killed and 330 Americans and 123 Panamanians
wounded, according to the Southern Command. Another 4,446
Panamanians have been detained.
   Panamanian doctors say more than 100 civilians were killed and
hundreds of others injured. No complete figure was available
because many civilians were buried quickly in common graves and
there were no authorities to keep records.

<TEXT>
   North Korea urged fellow Communist countries
Wednesday to heighten vigilance and unite against ``imperialist''
efforts to undermine socialism.
   A commentary in the official Communist Party newspaper Rodong
Shinmun did not directly mention the fall of the hard-line
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania or other changes in
Eastern Europe, although it blamed ``imperialists'' for what it
called a ``scheme to make the most of changes in political and
economic life in some socialist countries.''
   China and Cuba were the only countries identified in the report.
   North Korea is ruled by a hard-line Communist leadership headed
by Kim Il Sung, who, like Ceausescu, built a strong personality
cult.
   The commentary, broadcast in part by Pyongyang's official Korean
Central News Agency, said the U.S. ``imperialists'' were trying
military threats, blackmail, political and diplomatic pressure and
an economic blockade against Cuba.
   ``They are also continuing a vicious and shameless interference
in the internal affairs of China, displeased at the fact that the
Chinese people keep to the road of socialism ... after quelling the
counterrevolutionary riot'' _ a reference to China's June 3-4
military crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement.
   Rodong Shinmun said ``imperialists'' claim that ``some socialist
countries should be given `assistance' needed for leading some of
their policies to the capitalist market economy. They scheme to win
over and bring under their control socialist countries, declaring
that they would render economic `aid' to somer country and treat
some other country as `most favored nation.'''
   They slander socialism in the media, seek to ``infiltrate the
corrupt bourgeois ideology, culture and way of life into socialist
countries,'' and send in spies and saboteurs, the paper said.
   ``The situation makes it incumbent upon all socialist countries
and the anti-imperialist independent forces to heighten vigilance
over the vicious and crafty anti-socialist moves and reactionary
offensive of the imperialists and pool their strength to repulse
them,'' it added.

<HEAD>U.N. Appeals For 700,000 Tons of Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A U.N. agency appealed Wednesday for
700,000 tons of food to avert widespread starvation in northern
Ethiopia where as many as 4 million people are threatened by famine.
   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said its estimate was
based on a recent crop survey which found that serious drought had
cut harvests by nearly 80 percent in Eritrea and 50 percent in
Eritrea's southern neighbor, Tigre.
   The FAO said there also would be food deficits in eastern
Ethiopia and to a lesser extent in pockets of the southern and
central regions.
   An ``international relief operation of major proportions'' is
needed to avert a repeat of the 1984-85 drought and famine when an
estimated 1 million people died, said FAO Director-General Edouard
Saouma, in a statement issued in Nairobi.
   The Ethiopian government has put the number of people threatened
with hunger at 1.8 million and directed the country's own relief
agencies to study ways to get relief food to them.
   The situation has deteriorated since the initial estimates in
September by the Rome-based agency, Saouma said, and ``the
population at risk is increasing at an alarming rate.''
   He said current food stocks in the affected areas would be
exhausted by early 1990.
   Only 270,000 tons of food had been pledged so far by
international donors and appealed for 700,000 tons of emergency
food mostly for the drought-affected northern regions and 400,000
tons of structural and project food aid, he said.
   Saouma also urged donors to provide logistic support to ensure
the ``timely delivery'' of the emergency aid.
   Saouma did not specify the nature of logistic support but
fighting in Eritrea and Tigre between the government and insurgents
has closed many roads, a situation that might require aircraft for
relief deliveries.
   Relief agencies and donors have so far unsucessfully appealed to
the rebels and the government to agree on air and ground corridors
through which supplies can move, unhindered by fighting.
   Another U.N. Agency, the World Food Program, has appealed for
600,000 tons of food to feed as many as 4 million people threatened
with famine.

<HEAD>Romania Seeking Swiss Help to Recover Any Ceausescu Assets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's provisional governmment will
ask Switzerland for judicial assistance to try to recover any
assets Nicolae Ceausescu may have stashed in Swiss banks before he
was ousted and executed.
   Ambassador Gheorghe Dolgu, who declared his support for the
anti-Ceausescu uprising last week, delivered a diplomatic note to
the Swiss Justice Ministry on Wednesday announcing that a formal
request would follow. The new leadership has two months to detail
its request.
   In anticipation of the request, Switzerland on Sunday froze an
any assets linked to Ceausescu or his clan, addressing itself in
particular to two of its largest banks, Credit Suisse and Union
Bank of Switzerland.
   The action was taken after Moritz Leuenberger, a Social
Democratic member of parliament and lawyer, said he received
information from unidentified Romanian exile sources that Ceausescu
had transferred about $400 million, chiefly gold bullion, to
Zurich, much of it in recent weeks and months.
   Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said a circular from
the Romanian National Bank dated Dec. 25 asked all countries to
block any Ceausescu accounts they may be spotted.
   According to a videotape of his secret trial released by the new
leadership in Bucharest, Ceausescu denied having assets in
Switzerland and refused to sign a statement authorizing the return
of any such assets to the Romanian National Bank. His wife, Elena,
rejected the military court's question about Swiss funds as a
provocation.
   In Zurich, Union Bank spokeswoman Gertrud Erismann said the
freeze had been ``superfluous because no serious bank would permit
in such a situation permit the withdrawal of funds by people who
may have obtained them illegally.''
   She declined comment when asked whether Union Bank had traced
any funds. Confirming or denying their existence would violate
Swiss banking secrecy laws, she added.
   A Credit Suisse spokesman, Helmut Reinke, said a careful check
had not produced any evidence of Ceausescu-linked assets at the
bank.

   There's oil in them thar birds, and two
entrepreneurs are cashing in on the animal that's so despised in
its native land that the government once paid people to kill the
varmints.
   On a 65-acre tract in the East Texas Piney Woods, Mark Solomon
and Dusty Driskell are entering their second year as a new breed of
Texas oilmen _ raising emus.
   ``It's just been unbelievable for us, beyond our wildest
dreams,'' said Solomon, 27, whose full-time job with the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice is designing furniture manufactured
for the state by inmates.
   ``We have to pinch ourselves to see if we're awake. It's still
hard to believe and we have to tell ourselves it's really
happening,'' added Driskell, 29, a tax consultant.
   Last October, the lifelong friends purchased a pair of emus for
$1,800. The Australian birds, which resemble ostriches, now fetch
more than $12,000 per pair.
   They now have 31 birds, including 12 breeding pair. And profits
from sales of birds to people who buy them as an investment have
enabled Solomon and Driskell to purchase the 65-acre spread in
Houston County.
   ``People don't know what they are, but they've been good for
us,'' Solomon said.
   Emus can grow to about 5{ feet tall and can weigh up to 120
pounds. The only bigger bird is the ostrich. Emus have
brownish-black feathers, long neck and long legs that can propel
them about 30 mph.
   The bird's meat, leather and feathers are marketable, but what
makes emus valuable is the oil they secrete.
   The oil _ about 5 quarts per processed bird _ is used as a
pharmaceutical for people suffering from arthritis. In cosmetics,
the oil is used in production of wrinkle-retarding emollient.
   Driskell and Solomon say the meat, although not readily
available, tastes like beef and has less cholesterol and fewer
calories. The leather is used like ostrich leather and the feathers
are used for fishing lures and feather dusters. Even the large
toenails _ three per foot _ are used for jewelry.
   ``Right now it's strictly a breeders' market,'' Solomon said
recently. ``That's why prices are so high because there are not so
many around. But it's getting more common.''
   Emu prices are on the rise because of speculation about placing
a processing plant in the United States, according to the American
Emu Association, based in Harper. One plant already operates in
Europe and another in Australia, where thousands were killed and
bounties were placed on the emu because the bird trampled sheep
fences and ate crops.
   The association estimates about 1,500 breeding pair were in the
United States as of last year, with the largest concentration in
Texas. Driskell and Solomon have driven as far as Washington state
and Minnesota to purchase birds.
   ``Whenever the processing stage comes into play we're going to
get less per bird,'' Driskell said. ``But I'll be tickled to death
when it happens because you'll be looking at a definite place to
sell the bird and a definite income coming in.''
   Their first breeding pair, named Bonnie and Clyde, laid 36 eggs
the first year. The eggs, which are dark green and resemble
avocados, hatch in 48 to 52 days. And once the birds get into a
cycle, they'll lay eggs every three days.
   Driskell and Solomon are expanding their farm and hope to
eventually have 90 pens in operation.
   Some people will purchase chicks at $1,000 to $1,500 apiece,
keep them for three or four months and then sell for as much as
$3,000 each. Feed costs are minimal, ranging from $150 to $180 per
year for each bird.
   Neighbors who raise cattle like to joke that Texas is a land for
moo-moo, not emu.
   ``They are an ugly bird,'' Driskell acknowledged. ``But when
they sell for $12,000, they look pretty good.''

<TEXT>
   Now that he's been toppled and executed, Nicolae
Ceausescu has few defenders, his rank secure among the century's
most brutal and despised dictators.
   But it wasn't so long ago the Romanian president was the West's
favorite Communist, showered with kind words and economic benefits
for his role as a maverick in the East bloc.
   France was especially friendly toward Ceausescu's Romania for
many years, seeing a people with cultural affinities as well as a
country whose independence from the Soviet Union could be a
mirror-image for French refusal to follow U.S. foreign policy leads.
   In the aftermath of the Romanian revolution, France is now
seeing apologies and recriminations, as politicians and parties
accuse each other of being slow to realize the scope of Ceausescu's
abuses of power.
   Elsewhere, the change of heart has taken a different form. Queen
Elizabeth II stripped Ceausescu of his honorary knighthood ``as a
mark of revulsion at the abuse of human rights in Romania.''
   King Olav V of Norway took away his honorary Grand Cross of St.
Olav Order and, by action of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, the
Romanian leader was no longer a Knight of the Elephant Order when
he went before the firing squad.
   All three monarchs acted after Ceausescu was driven from power
Friday, wiping out honors that had been awarded about a decade
earlier, when Romania's reputation was at its height.
   The process occurring in the aftermath of Ceausescu's ouster is
similar to those that followed the demise of other dictators this
century, such as Josef Stalin in the Soviet Union, Ferdinand Marcos
of the Philippines, Idi Amin in Uganda and Jean-Bedel Bokassa of
the Central African Republic.
   It was not until early this year that the United States withdrew
Romania's valuable status as ``Most Favored Nation'' for trade
purposes, on grounds of human rights violations.
   As recently as 1986, Reagan administration officials were
defending Romania's Most Favored Nation status, with Edward J.
Derwinski, counselor of the State Department, telling a hostile
congressional committee that Romania had an ``overall reasonably
good record'' on allowing people to leave the country.
   Ceausescu's reputation for free-thinking was earned in foreign
affairs.
   He condemned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and
refused to join the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia that ended the
``Prague Spring'' liberalization movement.
   Ceausescu also stood apart from the other Communist countries
when he maintained links with Israel after the 1967 Middle East
War, eventually serving as mediator between Israel and Egypt in the
talks that led to their peace treaty.
   The gratitude won as the Jewish state's only ally in a hostile
Communist bloc has survived, although Israel condemned massive
killings by the secret police and pledged support for Romania's new
leadership.
   ``Speaking as Jews and Israelis we cannot forget the general
point, we cannot remember our enemies and forget our friends,''
Israel's former ambassador to Bucharest, Abba Geffen, said
Wednesday on Israel radio. ``We must not enter into the
anti-Ceausescu hysteria.''
   Anti-Ceausescu sentiment was mostly to be found in Moscow back
in 1969, when Richard Nixon chose Romania for the first visit by a
U.S. president to a Warsaw Pact country.
   Nixon and Ceausescu delighted crowds by joining in a traditional
Romanian peasant dance, with a Romanian girl dancing between them.
Their joint statement talked of a ``spirit of cordiality, sincerity
and mutual respect.''
   Earlier in the 1960s, French President Charles de Gaulle blazed
the trail of ties between the West and Romania.
   ``De Gaulle was following a policy of independence vis-a-vis the
United States. France was seeking an ally in the East. Ceausescu
was following a similar path in the Warsaw Pact,'' said Ewa
Kulesza, an expert on Eastern Europe at the French Institute for
International Relations in Paris.
   ``There was a kind of identification between De Gaulle's France
and Ceausescu's Romania. It was an illusion,'' she said in an
interview.
   The illusion, based in part on cultural associations between
France and Romania, whose languages are similar, was long-lasting.
   Claude Cheysson, former French foreign minister who visited
Romania in 1983, apologized for his role in an interview published
Monday in the leftist daily newspaper Liberation.
   ``We should have been more clear in our denunciations of what we
knew, of what we guessed about Romania, so that perhaps we could
have precipitated the movements that we see now,'' Cheysson was
quoted as saying.
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing accused the current
Socialist government of not doing enough to call attention to
Ceausescu's misdeeds.
   Socialist leaders criticized Giscard d'Estaing for exchanging
visits with Ceausescu _ while Mitterrand at least scrapped a
planned visit to Romania in 1982, although he cited scheduling
problems rather than human rights abuses. The trip was never
rescheduled.
   Giscard d'Estaing replied, in an interview in the rightist
newspaper Le Figaro, that he ``personally felt a strong antipathy''
for Ceausescu after their 1980 encounter in France, and said the
translator at their session could confirm it.
   The heaviest fire has focused on Georges Marchais, the hard-line
French Communist Party leader, who vacationed on Ceausescu's yacht
in 1984. Dissidents in the party called this week on Marchais and
the entire Politburo to resign because of their past support for
Ceausescu.
   The Politburo replied that Marchais had not seen Ceausescu in
five years, and had made many quiet appeals to the Romanian leader
for respect of human rights.

We were Romanians to all intents and purposes,'' said army Lt. Mike
Brown, an assistant defense attache.
   Fifteen members of the British Embassy in Bucharest and their
families arrived at London's Heathrow airport Tuesday night after
leaving Romania.
   The Foreign Office said Wednesday it had ``no problems'' with
Brown's actions in Bucharest.
   A spokesman, who was not identified in accordance with British
practice, said: ``As he made clear, he joined the crowd in order to
be able to report developments. If he had not shown some degree of
enthusiasm the crowd might have asked who he was. There were
concerns in the crowd about the activities of the security forces.''
   Brown, 40, said he went into the streets with the embassy second
secretary, Susan Laffey, to observe the uprising.
   ``We worked as a team out on the streets for a considerable
time. The most remembered part for me was when we joined in with
the students to take the television station,'' Brown said.
   ``We went along with them. We went along with the armored
personnel carriers they had captured, bedecked with civilians,
flags, flowers and Christmas trees.
   ``We drove to the television building, went through the building
and through the forbidden zone and stormed the building with them.''
   Brown said it was the diplomats' job to observe the situation
and they were ``taken along with it all.''
   ``We were swept away by the emotion of it all. It was very
exciting and we felt part of the events unfolding on the streets,''
said Miss Laffey, 28.
   When asked if he felt his action violated his diplomatic role,
Brown replied: ``I don't think we took part in it. We went along as
fairly passive observers and I think that was our job. If we hadn't
cheered and shouted slogans there might have been queries as to who
we were.''
   Brown said on another occasion he and the defense attache had
driven on an armored personnel carrier to the scene of an attack
and went through so much blood in the streets they thought it was
water.
   ``I think there was an orgy of killing,'' Brown said.
   Brown said the British diplomats worked in four groups of pairs
observing activities.
   ``I don't think any of us had come away unscathed,'' he said.
``It will certainly be on my mind for the rest of my life. I feel
tremendous affiliation with the Romanian people.
   ``They have changed from being a nation of people who walk down
the streets with their heads down. Now they are happy, they read
newspapers in the streets and have smiles on their faces.''
   Veronica Atkinson, wife of British Ambassador Michael Atkinson,
who has remained in Bucharest, said she hid in the basement of the
embassy residence when one of the security policemen fighting the
army was on the premises.
   ``We were terrified. We feared for our lives. Had we made any
noise we would probably have been killed,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
attempts in October to convince Erich Honecker to abandon Stalinism
helped topple the East Germany leader, a former Honecker aide was
quoted as saying Wednesday.
   Gorbachev visited Honecker in East Berlin on Oct. 7-8 for
celebrations marking East Germany's 40th anniversary of statehood.
His visit came as a fledgling pro-democracy movement was growing in
strength.
   In an interview with the newspaper Junge Welt, former Parliament
speaker Horst Sindermann said that Gorbachev tried to convince the
Communist Party chief to pursue reform, and that Honecker resisted.
   ``The realization that Honecker must go was growing all the
time. The last push came from Gorbachev's visit for the 40th
anniversary,'' Sindermann was quoted as saying.
   Sindermann's interview was the first insight into the power
struggle that preceded Honecker's last days in office and the
pivotal role played by Gorbachev's visit.
   Honecker, a hard-liner who ruled East Germany for 18 years, was
ousted Oct. 18 and replaced as party leader by Egon Krenz. Growing
pressure from the pro-democracy movement and dissent in party ranks
forced Krenz and the entire Communist party leadership to step down
Dec. 3.
   A new Communist-led reformist coalition took its place and has
agreed with the pro-democracy opposition to hold free elections on
May 6, 1990.
   The 77-year-old Honecker and 11 of his former aides _ including
Sindermann _have been expelled from the party. Honecker has been
placed under house arrest and he and other leaders are accused of
profiting financially from their positions of power.
   Gorbachev's visit came during a mass exodus of East Germans to
the West. The official celebrations of East German statehood were
marked by anti-government demonstrations, which included clashes
between activists and security police.
   Sindermann, one of Honecker's closest aides in the ruling
Politburo, said differences between Honecker and other Politburo
members had been growing for some time.
   Describing a meeting between Gorbachev and the Politburo during
the Soviet leader's visit, Sindermann said Gorbachev urged the
leaders to pursue perestroika, the Soviet leader's system of social
and economic reforms.
   ``He told us we would have a much easier time with perestroika
because we have a much higher level of economic development,''
Sindermann said.
   ``But Honecker kept on pulling out a U.N. statistic that showed
that we had a higher productivity than the Soviet Union. And he
used it to argue that we must stay true to the old course,''
Sindermann was quoted as saying. ``He told this to Gorbachev, too.
That gave the impulse. We came out of the meeting and we were
united. Now is the end.
   ``The next day we went to the Politburo and (former premier
Willi) Stoph made the motion to remove Honecker. And that's how it
happened,'' Sindermann was quoted as saying.
   He said the Politburo voted unanimously to oust Honecker. ``He
was fighting against it.''
   Meanwhile, talks between the Communist-led coalition government
and the opposition resumed in controversy Wednesday when the
chairman of Democratic Awakening, one of the new political parties,
withdrew from the forum.
   Wolfgang Schnur denied newspaper allegations that he had abused
his position to obtain a large apartment. But Schnur said he was
withdrawing from the talks until the matter is clarified.
   The fourth session of the discussions on the future of the
country ended Wednesday with opposition calls for more say in the
day-to-day running of the country.
   Several opposition leaders called on Communist Premier Hans
Modrow to attend all the sessions and to consult more with the
participants over important government decisions.
   The talks involve 37 representatives from five established
political parties, including the Communists, and 16 opposition
groups.
   The forum is acting as a watchdog group on Modrow's government
until the elections.
   The official news agency ADN published results of a survey
carried out last week in Leipzig, the cradle of East Germany's
pro-democracy movement, that gave Modrow a 66 percent approval
rating, up from 58 percent a week earlier.

<HEAD>Syria and Egypt Restore Relations After 12-Year Rift</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with relations restored. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria and Egypt today agreed to restore
diplomatic relations after a 12-year rift, the two governments
announced.
   Syria broke ties with Egypt in late 1977 when then-President
Anwar Sadat opened peace negotiations with Israel.
   A summit between presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt will take place early in January, the prime
ministers of the two countries said in a joint statement released
in Cairo and Damascus.
   ``The governments of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Arab
Republic of Egypt have agreed to resume full diplomatic relations,
effective Wednesday, December 27, 1989,'' the statement in Damascus
said.
   ``This comes to express the determination of the two peoples to
consolidate brotherly relations in all fields,'' it said.
   The breakthrough occurred after a series of meetings this years
between officials of the two Arab countries.
   Earlier today, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Sedki hinted during
a visit to Damascus that the two countries would resume relations.
   Sedki, the first such high-ranking Egyptian official to visit
Damascus since the rift began, received a warm welcome by his
counterpart, Mahmoud Zoubi, when he arrived at Damascus airport.
   After an official ceremony and a brief meeting in the VIP lounge
at Damascus airport, the two prime ministers drove to the
Muhajereen Presidential Palace for a meeting with Assad, state-run
Damascus radio reported.
   The broadcast quoted Sedki as saying in an arrival statement
that he was ``very pleased'' to visit Syria and that he was
carrying a message to Assad from Mubarak. He did not disclose the
contents of the letter.
   ``Egypt's goal is to unify ranks with Syria and consolidate
cooperation between our two countries,'' Sedki said.
   Zoubi told reporters, ``We are looking forward to more
cooperation and coordination for the benefit of the entire (Arab)
nation.''
   He said restoring ties ``will open a new page in the history of
our common destiny. Developments witnessed by the Arab world
require that Syria and Egypt return to each other on the basis of
their historical and fraternal bonds.''
   Cairo-Damascus relations were severed in December 1977, one
month after Sadat visited Jerusalem to begin a peace process that
led to the signing of the U.S.-sponsored Camp David peace treaty in
March 1979.
   Sixteen other Arab states severed relations with Egypt after the
treaty. All except Syria and Libya had since restored ties with
Cairo.
   Egypt's ties with Libya have improved but have not been restored.

   Defiant students shouted out criticisms of Deng
Xiaoping and his hand-picked successor Wednesday in a dialogue with
a senior government official.
   The Beijing University students, in a two-hour meeting with
State Council spokesman Yuan Mu, also sought China's response to
events in Romania and hissed when Yuan stressed that China won't
veer from its socialist road.
   Yuan's meeting with the students appeared timed to the overthrow
of Romania's dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, which has rekindled sparks
of student activism smothered by the June crackdown on the
student-led pro-democracy movement.
   At least three illegal posters have gone up at Beijing and
Qinghua universities in recent days commenting on Romania's
uprising, according to Chinese and Western sources. One poster
said, ``Learn from Romania.''
   Another, one of two at Beijing University, described Ceausescu
as a ``lost dog'' who might try to flee to China, whose leaders had
regarded him as a friend. All the posters were torn down swiftly by
authorities.
   It was one of the first open acts of opposition to the
government on the campus since it was in the forefront of the
crushed student movement.
   A student who attended the meeting said about 300 students with
tickets issued by official student associations were allowed to
attend the meeting, and only university-approved student leaders
could read questions submitted in advance.
   But one student shouted out a question asking why former party
chief Zhao Ziyang was purged following the June turmoil and blamed
for China's economic and political problems when it was his mentor,
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who has decided policy in the past
decade.
   Yuan didn't answer, and also didn't respond when a student asked
why Deng had suddenly anointed new party chief Jiang Zemin as the
``core'' of China's new leaders after allowing the ouster of two
tried and experienced revolutionaries, Zhao and former party
General Secretary Hu Yaobang.
   Hu, whose death in April set off the pro-democracy movement, was
also dismissed from office, in January 1987, after being blamed for
failing to stop student rallies for democratic reform.
   The students asked the whereabouts of Zhao, who has not been
seen in public since May, and were told he is in Beijing. They also
asked about Wang Dan, the Beijing University student who was one of
the leaders of the spring movement.
   Beijing City party Secretary General Yuan Liben said he was
under arrest, but provided no other details.
   When asked about Romania, Yuan Mu replied: ``No matter what the
situation is in the rest of the world, China will always walk the
path of socialism, uphold the socialist flag and adhere to the
leadership of the Communist Party of China.''
   The student participant said Yuan spoke with vehemence, standing
up and banging his hand on the table.
   But when he went on to repeat familiar socialist principles,
some students made hissing noises. ``The students were very brave
to do that in these times,'' the student said.
   Some students also yelled out questions about the legitimacy of
two student leaders who were reading questions. In May, when
independent student organizations were formed to challenge the
officially sanctioned student unions, students voted the two out of
office. The independent unions have since been declared illegal and
the sanctioned groups restored to their former place.
   The student said the session ended without all the questions
being answered but that both sides appeared glad to terminate the
largely fruitless dialogue.
   Since June, university students have been subjected to a
campaign of heavy political indoctrination and have been forced to
write ``confessions'' repenting their activities during the
demonstrations.
   Students say another major uprising is unlikely at present
because of the political repression and close surveillance, but
that anger over the bloody military attack in June when hundreds,
and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators were killed has not
subsided.
   In addition to the poster at Beijing University, another poster
was seen recently outside the Central Drama Academy urging students
to remember June. At least six people were arrested Dec. 9 when
students from the Beijing College of Aeronautics unfurled a banner
in front of the central TV station reading: ``Motherland, why are
you so poor?''

   President Bush said today that
ousted Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega's knowledge of CIA
activities could not embarrass the U.S. government but that he
could try to ``blindside'' the U.S. judicial process.
   ``I think that's history, and I think the main thing is he
should be tried and brought to justice,'' Bush said at a brief news
conference as he arrived in Texas for a six-day fishing and hunting
vacation.
   He said a trial on drug-trafficking charges lodged against
Noriega in this country could result in ``some release of certain
confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole
justice process.'' But, he added, ``The system works, so I wouldn't
worry about that.''
   Bush was asked if he would direct release of any documents
Noriega might request in order to avoid challenges to the fairness
of the trial as occurred in the case of Iran-Contra defendant
Oliver North. He replied, ``There'd be enough to see that he's
given a totally fair trial, certainly ....''
   Later, Bush appeared to leave open the possibility that Noriega
could be tried in Panama. He said there was a threat of Noriega
regaining power if he remained there ``unless he were in total
custody and sentenced to the prison sentence he deserves.''
   The president said he was personally involved in efforts to gain
custody of Noriega from the Vatican embassy in Panama, where
Noriega has been sheltered since Christmas Eve, but he had not
contacted either the papal nuncio in Panama City or Pope John Paul
II.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
aboard Air Force One en route to Texas that Noriega ``can talk
about the CIA and Bush until he's blue in the face. It won't hurt
anything.''
   He was referring to things Noriega might reveal about his
previous close relations with the U.S. government, including the
period in the 1970s when Bush was CIA director and Noriega was an
intelligence source.
   ``We want Noriega here because he would cause trouble wherever
he goes ... We want him in a nice jail cell where we can keep an
eye on him,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said it would ``require a lot of diplomatic effort and a lot
of it on my part'' to address the concerns of Latin American
leaders who have been critical of U.S. military action in Panama.
   But he said that as they see democracy functioning in Panama and
Noriega brought to justice, they would ``begin to see the problem
that might have been caused by a prolonged conflict down there ...''
   Bush, taking questions yelled above the roar of helicopter
rotors at a naval air station, said there would be ``no time
limit'' on negotiations over Noriega.
   The president was asked about the reported refusal of the
Vatican to surrender Noriega, who has taken shelter in its Panama
City embassy, to U.S. authorities. ``That complicates things if
they said that,'' he said.
   Bush said that, however, he wanted more specific information on
the Vatican's position and would not give up hopes of winning
Noriega's extradition. ``We will continue to negotiate,'' he said.
   The president defended his decision to take the year-end
vacation in view of the Panama situation, claiming he did not think
it amounted to shirking his responsibility as chief executive
during a time of crisis.
   ``I'm not concerned about that at all. Why should I be?'' he
said. ``Things have gone well. It's winding down.''
   The president said that he would stay in constant touch with his
national security advisers in Washington by telephone, ``by secure
link,'' and he noted that Secretary of State James A. Baker III had
come along with him for part of the vacation.
   ``Look, I don't make any cover. I'm going to be enjoying myself
and I think the American people understand that,'' he said. ``I
think I've worked pretty hard all year.''
   On another subject, Bush said he hoped that stability could soon
be restored to Romania and said that the provisional government and
the army appeared to be doing a good job of restoring order.
   ``My concern is for tranquillity and freedom in Romania,'' Bush
said.
   The president said that he was ``touched'' by hearing a ``guy
singing a Christmas carol'' on Romania's state-run television.
   Claiming it was the first time that a Christmas carol had been
heard on the public airwaves in 40 years, Bush said, ``It made a
dramatic statement for me.''
   ``Democracy and freedom is on the move around the world,'' he
said.
   Bush, who wore a hunting jacket and the pinstriped pants of his
suit as he spoke briefly with reporters aboard the plane, said he
spent much of his Christmas holiday at Camp David, Md., on the
phone but ``got a great Christmas present'' in Noriega's overthrow
by U.S. troops on Dec. 19.
   The president and his wife, Barbara, were at Camp David with
their five children and their families, including 11 grandchildren.
   Describing his holiday, Bush said, ``It was cold, wonderful _
sleigh riding for the kids. It was great.''
   Earlier, Fitzwater said Bush will keep close tabs on
developments in Panama by telephone. He said Tuesday the
administration told the Vatican ``very directly'' it wants Noriega
returned for trial.
   Fitzwater said Bush was not taking a direct role in the
negotiations on Noriega's extradition.
   After fishing in the Gulf of Mexico later today near Corpus
Christi, Bush was to travel by helicopter some 60 miles to the
ranch of a friend near Beeville, where he will spend two days quail
hunting.
   He goes to Houston on Friday, where he will stay until Monday.
On Sunday, he plans a side trip to two military hospitals near San
Antonio to visit U.S. soldiers wounded in Panama.

   Nicolae Ceausescu made the first of
his final mistakes when he tried to deport the Rev. Laszlo Toekes,
a popular pastor of Hungarian heritage who spoke his mind from the
pulpit in Timisoara.
   Romania's durable dictator did not like Hungarians, and a
rambunctious community of ethnic Hungarians challenged his control.
Toekes, articulate and courageous, amounted to a dissident.
   On Friday, Dec. 15, youths in the city about 300 miles west of
Bucharest formed a human chain to shield him from police and
prevent his arrest. They were dispersed with tear gas and water
cannons, but even larger crowds gathered at the cathedral the next
day.
   Crowds again formed on Sunday _ more raucous and threatening _
but still peaceable. Local officials, fearing wrath from the
Ceausescu if things got out of hand, ordered heavy repression.
   Security forces drove assault vehicles into the crowd, and they
opened fire. Innocent protesters died in their friends' arms. So
did children. No one knew the death toll, but word began to spread
around the world.
   Then Ceausescu made another mistake. He ignored the explosive
situation and left on a three-day trip to Iran. Authorities had to
use their own judgment, with only the dictator's iron-willed wife,
Elena, to guide them.
   Because the world had gotten word of what was happening in
Romania, even other Romanians _ for a change _ were informed.
Foreign radio broadcasts, including those from neighboring Hungary,
echoed the news to Bucharest, the capital, and spurred protesters
in Timisoara.
   Despite the violent repression, demonstrators came back, and the
guns fired again. Killings were mostly by the hated Securitate, a
secret police and elite guard fiercely loyal to Ceausescu. But the
army helped subdue protesers.
   What should have been crowd control was a chilling example of
the ruthless terror Ceausescu had applied to keep his increasingly
extravagant personal regime in place: a protest of one man's
impending arrest was suddenly a release for years of pent-up hatred.
   By Thursday, Ceausescu was back in Bucharest, facing the worst
crisis in 24 years of power. That's when he made another mistake.
   Yet again, Ceausescu summoned his masses for a spontaneous
outburst of their warmth and loyalty. At a huge rally, he harangued
them with the old slogans. If students were unhappy, he would raise
their allowances a little. Some subsidies would be increased.
   As for Timisoara, he said, it was the work of ``hooligan
elements,'' and ``external meddlers.''
   Most of the crowd had to be there, and their future in
Ceausescu's society depended upon how earnestly they cheered. But
one group of young people, mostly students, had heard those
Stalinist formulas once too often.
   They whistled and booed Ceausescu to silence, demanding an
explanation for the events in Timisoara. The live TV and radio
broadcast was cut for several minutes to spare the dictator further
embarrassment.
   Ceausescu's face showed disbelief as he plowed on. But he had
lost the crowd. Obedient applause was drowned out by cries of
``Death! Death!'' and ``Down with Ceausescu!''
   When the shaken dictator finished, students staged their own
rally. They snaked through Bucharest streets, picking up in number
and staying slightly ahead of the water cannons. At nightfall,
thousands had assembled around University Square.
   Sometime during the night, the secret police went for blood.
Light tanks crashed into the crowd. Marksmen atop buildings shot
people in the back. Covered trucks carried the bodies to secret
graves.
   But the students came back the next morning, on Friday. Army
tanks rolled up to face them. But they did not fire. Instead,
students stuck Christmas tree branches down their rifle barrels,
and soldiers smiled shyly, in sympathy with the crowd.
   Ceausescu's media pressed on in his service. At 11 a.m., the
television announced that Defense Minister Vasile Milea committed
suicide because he was found to be a traitor. Quickly, word spread
that he was shot for not ordering repressive fire.
   A small delegation walked to the Communists' Central Committee
building and persuaded the army to join the people.
   Ceausescu finally got the message. He and his wife took a
helicopter to a government airbase 30 miles north but could not
arrange a safe haven in another country. They headed north in a
small car, humbled and on the run, until they were captured.
   For days afterward, secret police diehards fought urban
guerrilla warfare to take back the capital. The Central Committee
building and the elegant palace nearby was bombed out and burned.
Many thousands of Romanians had to be buried.
   Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu were tried by a secret military
tribunal. He animatedly argued that the charges against him were
lies, that he ordered no killings, that he and his wife lived as
ordinary Romanians.
   But he made no apparent admission of the mistakes he made. He
and his wife were convicted of grave crimes against Romania, put up
against a concrete wall and executed by three riflemen chosen from
among hundreds who volunteered.

   An East German company is taking over sale of
pieces of the crumbling Berlin Wall, with the proceeds to be
donated to humanitarian causes in East Germany, the official news
agency ADN said Wednesday.
   ``Limex-Bau Export-Import Co. is taking over the sale of
available original parts of the Berlin Wall,'' ADN said.
   ``Profits will be used solely for humanitarian purposes, such as
health facilities,'' ADN said, quoting the state-owned company's
manager, Peter Pfannschmidt.
   East German border troops will help secure parts of the wall
made available for sale, ADN said.
   Up to now, sale of parts of the wall had been left up to
companies outside East Germany, the report said. It did not
identify the firms.
   Since the Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9, hundreds of souvenir
hunters have flocked to the western side of the barrier daily to
chisel away pieces.
   Ambitious hawkers have been selling small chunks of the wall to
tourists in West Berlin for prices ranging from $2.95 to $29.
   In most cases, authorities have not interfered with the wall
chiselers, but last week West Berlin police detained two Americans
and a West Berlin man who had loaded five 3-foot-by-8-foot sections
of the wall onto a truck. The men, who were not identified, were
released.

<TEXT>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
``Glory'' and ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' scored the most honors
in Golden Globe nominations announced today by the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
   The two war-oriented films, one about Vietnam, the other on the
Civil War, were nominated five times each, along with the modern
romance comedy.
   They were followed by ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Do the Right
Thing'' and ``The Little Mermaid'' with four nominations apiece.
   The Golden Globes, first of the Hollywood award season, often
serve as a bellwether for the Oscars, though the foreign press
members are noted for eccentricities.
   The Golden Globes divide films and star performances into two
categories, drama and musical or comedy.

   The Vatican on Wednesday said it had not yet
reached a decision about Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but it
declared it would not simply push him out of its embassy in Panama
and hand him to U.S. authorities.
   Cuba, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have been reported to
be contenders for accepting the ousted Panamanian leader, but
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said that so far the Holy See had
not contacted any third country.
   ``It's too soon,'' Navarro told a news briefing. He added that
``as of this moment,'' the Vatican has not yet made a decision
about Noriega's bid for asylum status.
   Navarro was pressed repeatedly about Bush administration
assertions that the United States officials forcefully demanded
Noriega be turned over to U.S. authorities so he can be tried on
drug trafficking charges.
   ``The United States has put its case very clearly and with
respect and very cordially,'' Navarro said.
   The Vatican also presented its case ``with the same clarity,''
Navarro said.
   ``Taking into account international law and accepted procedure,
I don't see how the embassy can hand over someone'' to a nation
other than the host country, he said.
   The Vatican spokesman declined to comment on the U.S. criminal
accusations against Noriega.
   But he said, ``he has also been head of government and of the
armed forces. There's something more than a criminal case here.''
   On Wednesday, a Spanish newspaper published an interview with
Guillermo Endara, who was installed as president after the
invasion. Endara, whose election in May was voided when Noriega
seized the ballots, was quoted as saying that Noriega should stand
trial and added: ``Panama cannot permit him to leave the country.''
   Navarro said there had been no request by Panama for Noriega as
of Wednesday morning.
   Despite his estimate that the dilemma could be resolved ``in a
few days, not weeks,'' Navarro offered no evidence that the United
States and the Vatican were close to a solution.
   Noriega has been staying at the Vatican embassy in Panama since
Sunday.
   ``He is not allowed to make telephone calls, not allowed
visits,'' Navarro said. ``He is simply staying'' at the embassy
while his case is debated.
   Navarro said the general, a captain and his wife, and another
Panamanian military officer were allowed to stay after Noriega made
``a very serious commitment to help in easing the situation, the
bloodshed'' in the wake of the U.S. invasion.
   Navarro said it was the papal nuncio, or envoy, who
``autonomously'' decided to give Noriega shelter.
   While Pope John Paul II is not actively involved in the talks he
has been kept informed of the situation, Navarro said.
   The U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, Thomas P. Melady, met
Wednesday with Monsignor Angelo Sodano, a senior Vatican diplomatic
official with expertise in Latin American affairs, Navarro said.
   Navarro expressed hope the case would be resolved to the
satisfaction of both the United States and the Vatican and ``in
accordance with the international right (law) and justice.''
   The Vatican is studying the case in its ``juridical, diplomatic
and humanitarian, and therefore, ethical considerations,'' Navarro
said.
   Seeking to dispel the reports of tense U.S-Vatican relations,
Navarro said the U.S. side had sent a message of appreciation for
Vatican officials' availability during the Christmas religious
festivities.
   Navarro stressed that Noriega's action is seen as part of an
``accepted practice'' in Latin American countries of seeking asylum
in embassies.
   As for cases involving the Vatican, ``no one has ever been
expelled'' from an embassy after seeking asylum, Navarro said.
   He pointed out that just two months ago, the Vatican mission in
Panama City sheltered Endara after he was beaten by Noriega
supporters.
   The late Cardinal Josef Mindszenty took refuge in the U.S.
mission in Budapest after Soviet forces crushed the 1956 Hungarian
uprising. He had been freed earlier from prison by Hungarian
revolutionaries. He had been convicted of treason in 1949 in what
was considered a rigged trial.
   Mindszenty left at the embassy in 1971 under an agreement with
the Vatican.

   A twin-engine commuter plane crashed and
burst into flames after trying to land at an airport, killing the
six people aboard, authorities said.
   The United Express plane went down 100 feet short of a runway at
the Tri-Cities Airport, said Dave Duff, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman in Seattle.
   Visibility was seven miles and winds were calm when the
Jetstream turbo prop went down at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, Duff said.
   The plane apparently split in half on impact and fire broke out
in the forward section about one minute later, Duff said.
   One of the first to reach the scene was firefighter Dave Bickle,
who said he ``didn't know how anybody could have survived. It was a
ball of flame.''
   The year-old aircraft had a two-man crew, Capt. Barry ``Will''
Roberts, 38, and First Officer Doug McInroe, 25, both of Kennewick,
said Craig Belmondo, president of the airline.
   Belmondo said the passengers included Kim Shewmaker of Richland,
a United Express pilot; Rey Resendez of Duncanville, Texas; and W.
Kingry of Denver. Kingry's first name was not available and the
identity of the sixth victim was being withheld pending
notification of relatives. All passengers were male, Belmondo said,
correcting a report that a woman was on board.
   Belmondo estimated the plane crashed 500 to 700 feet short of
the runway and said it plowed into a sagebrush field where it burst
into flames.
   He said he could not speculate on the cause of the crash.
   Belmondo said there had been no reports of problems during the
flight from Seattle to Pasco via Yakima.
   United Express is one of five commuter airlines of the same name
around the country operating under a marketing agreement with
United Airlines. It uses the United logo and acts as a feeder
service to the larger airline.
   The commuter airline is based in this town 180 miles southeast
of Seattle. It serves Washington state, Oregon, Idaho and Montana
and had a fleet of 25 planes.
   The Jetstream is built by British Aerospace and can hold 21
people, said Randy Lanfell, a United Express pilot.

<HEAD>Police Trying to Build Murder Case Against `Vampire Rapist'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rapist who called himself a vampire and
drank a victim's blood is suspected in at least six slayings, and
prosecutors are trying to build a murder case against him before he
gets out of prison.
   ``I don't feel comfortable with him being in our community,''
State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said of ``vampire rapist'' John
Crutchley. ``The only crime we've proven him of is reason enough.''
   Crutchley's former lawyer, Joe Mitchell, said he tried to work
out a plea bargain in which Crutchley would have admitted to up to
six murders and led investigators to the burial sites. But the
talks broke down.
   Wolfinger said Tuesday the informal negotiations broke down
because the state could not produce solid evidence linking
Crutchley to any deaths.
   ``There comes a point in the negotiations when the state has to
show something,'' the prosecutor said. ``If we had had anything to
tie a charge to, we would have done it. But we had nothing.''
   Crutchley, a former engineer, pleaded guilty in 1986 to raping a
19-year-old woman and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
Prosecutors agreed to drop several other charges, including robbing
the woman of nearly half her blood.
   With time off for good behavior, Crutchley could be out of
prison by 1992.
   Doctors saihey have long suspected him in the deaths of at
least six women in Brevard County _ five victims whose bodies were
discovered in 1985 and another woman who disappeared.
   But Wolfinger said his strategy was ``to get him in prison and
continue the investigation of the homicides.''
   ``We will continue to work these cases as hard as we can,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Israel Extends Emergency Regulations in Occupied Territories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Wednesday extended for two years
emergency regulations that allow the military to hold Palestinian
prisoners from the occupied territories inside Israeli territory.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, shops were closed by a
general strike called by the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas,
or Zeal. The strike was first ordered for Christmas but was delayed
when Palestinian Christians objected.
   Israeli troops shot and wounded four Palestinians in clashes
with stone-throwing youths in the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital
officials said.
   At least 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
2-year-old uprising against Israeli occupation. Forty-three
Israelis also have died, and 162 Palestinians have been slain by
fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.
   The latest death of a suspected collaborator occurred Wednesday,
when Jawad Hassan Mahmoud Tmaizi, 40, died of wounds suffered in an
attack by fellow Arabs the previous day.
   The 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, extended the Emergency
Regulations of 1967 for two years at the request of the government.
The vote was 29-9.
   The regulations permit the military to hold Palestinians
arrested in the occupied lands in Israeli territory. They make
Israeli law applicable to Israelis in the territories but not to
Palestinians, who are judged in military courts.
   ``This means there are different laws for Jews and Arabs. This
bill perpetuates discrimination,'' Amnon Rubinstein of the liberal
Shinui Party said during the Knesset's brief debate on the issue.
   The army is holding about 9,000 Palestinians and has jailed more
than 40,000 during the uprising.
   Many have been held in the Ketziot prison camp in Israel's Negev
desert, and the United States and human rights group have
repeatedly complained that imprisonment there violates the Geneva
human rights convention rule against moving prisoners out of
occupied territory.
   Also Wednesday, about 1,300 American and European peace
activists toured towns in the West Bank, but witnesses said the
army blocked one bus of about 50 people from entering Jericho,
while letting a second one through later.
   Marina Sereni, spokeswoman for the ``1990: Time for Peace''
movement, said the army gave no reason for the action. The army
spokesman's office said it had no information about the bus.
   Ms. Sereni said the group was appealing to authorities to
reverse a ban on visits by the peace activists to Palestinian
refugee camps.
   Elizabeth Donini, an Italian delegate from Torino, also said the
army intended to block Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip from joining the group's ``peace chain'' demonstration
Saturday.
   ``We are here to stress Palestinian rights, and this act is
unjust,'' she told reporters. ``We are here to demonstrate
together, Palestinians, Israelis and Europeans, and stress the
importance of peace.''
   Army officials have refused to comment on newspaper reports that
Palestinians from the territories will be barred from taking part
in the forming of a human chain around Jerusalem's Old City.

   Sylvester Stallone has sued an art broker for
$5 million, claiming she led him to pay millions of dollars more
than he should have for several artworks.
   The fraud and breach-of-contract suit, filed Tuesday, charges
that Barbara Guggenheim persuaded Stallone to pay $1.8 million for
a painting she told him was an excellent investment.
   After buying it sight unseen, the star of the ``Rocky'' and
``Rambo'' movies said he discovered that 25 percent to 30 percent
of it had been restored or retouched and that its previous owner
had tried for some time to sell it.
   Based on that painting, the suit charges, Stallone believes he
also paid too much for several other works bought through Ms.
Guggenheim.
   Ms. Guggenheim could not immediately be reached for comment.
There is no Los Angeles-area phone listing for her.

   Former Romanian gymnastics star Nadia
Comaneci and her companion, Constantin Panait, have been avoiding
family, fellow Romanians and even some people who want to help them.
   One of those who haven't heard from Nadia and Panait is Maria
Panait. When Constantin ran off with Nadia, he left his wife with
four young children and no money.
   ``I thought at least he would call for Christmas,'' she said
Tuesday, ``but no.''
   Sightings of the couple have been reported from all over.
   ``I heard West Palm Beach from one member of my congregation,''
said Father Traian Pedrescu, pastor of The Holy Trinity Romanian
Orthodox Church in neighboring Mirmar, a gathering place for many
of the estimated 5,000 Romanians in South Florida.
   ``But honestly, with what is happening now in our country, most
of them would say, `Who cares?'''
   Mike Jacki, executive director of the U.S. Gymnastics
Federation, expected to hear from Nadia. After her escape from
Romania last month, the federation received more than a dozen
offers for movies, books and appearances.
   ``And I'm almost willing to bet that to this day, she doesn't
know a thing about them,'' Jacki said. ``We could never reach her
to tell her, so we put it out through the media.''

   Women will be earning more doctoral degrees
than men by the year 2000, the Department of Education predicted
Wednesday.
   In a projection of educational statistics for the remaining
decade of the 20th century, the department also said elementary and
secondary school enrollments will increase dramatically and
teachers will be paid 14 percent more in real purchasing power.
   ``This publication will be a useful planning tool for our
nation's governors, federal, state and local leaders and members of
the business community,'' Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said in
a statement.
   Women have been earning more associate, bachelor's and master's
degrees than men for the past several years, but 1999 is expected
to be the first year that they exceed men in the number of doctoral
degrees received.
   Men will continue their dominance of first professional degrees
in such fields as medicine and law, according to the study,
entitled ``Projections of Education Statistics to 2000.''
   Other highlights of the study include:
   _Secondary and elementary school enrollment is expected to reach
49.5 million by the time classes begin in the fall of 2000, an
increase of about 4 million students or 9 percent over the current
school year. Enrollment has declined 4 percent in the past 11 years.
   _The biggest shift will be in the secondary schools, since the
rise in enrollment reflects an increase in births that began in
1977 and has continued. Secondary school enrollment peaked at 15.7
million in 1976, has since declined steadily and is expected to
drop to 12.6 million students, its lowest since 1963, next year. It
is expected to climb to 14.8 million, an increase of 18 percent, by
the end of the century.
   _The average public school teacher is expected to earn 14
percent more in real purchasing power, after adjusting for
inflation, in the year 2000 than now. The national average in the
current school year is $31,200.
   _The number of classroom teachers will increase by an estimated
15 percent, reaching 3.1 million by the year 2000. Most of the
increase will be absorbed in secondary schools, which have lower
student-teacher ratios and a greater range of subjects.
   _The pupil-teacher ratio will continue to drop, although not as
steeply as in the 1980s. By 2000 the ratio for elementary and
secondary schools, both public and private, is expected to be 16.1
students per teacher. In the current year it is 16.9. In 1978 it
was 19.2.
   _Expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary
schools, now about $4,800, are expected to rise by 24 percent after
adjusting for inflation.
   _College and university enrollments are expected to increase
from 12.8 million to 13.4 million, a gain of 4 percent. Faculty
will also increase by 4 percent, from 741,000 in 1988 to 771,000 in
2000.

   President Bush said today he is
``amazed and respectful'' of the changes that have taken place in
Romania and that he hopes now for ``tranquility and freedom'' in
the East Bloc country.
   Bush told reporters he was concerned that the trial of Romania's
deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was held in secret, ``but that's
their matter,'' he said.
   ``I'm just amazed and respectful of the change that has taken
place,'' he said as arrived here for six days of hunting and
fishing.
   The task ahead for Romanians is ``to bring the remaining holdout
forces to bay,'' Bush said. ``The army seems to be doing that, and
my concern is for tranquility and freedom in Romania.''
   The president sent a congratulatory message to Romania's new
head of state, President Ion Iliescu.
   ``The president expressed his sympathy over the tragic bloodshed
over the past two weeks and his hope that Romania will now move
along on a peaceful path of democratic change,'' the White House
said in a statement issued in Corpus Christi.
   The administration was sending a C-141 cargo plane loaded with
medical supplies to Romania on Thursday, the Agency for
International Development (AID) announced.
   The cost of the flight and supplies, about $250,000, was in
addition to the $500,000 in cash the administration was giving to
the International Red Cross for medical supplies, along with
$25,000 from an embassy contingency fund in Romania.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said that
the U.S. ambassador to Bucharest, Alan Green, had requested an
appointment with the provisional president, Ion Iliescu, but no
appointment had been scheduled.
   Commenting on reports of an anti-Communist rally in the Romanian
capital, Dillen said the embassy had reported the demonstration was
attended by 500 to 1,000 students, and that a student leader had
appeared on Romanian television.
   ``We encourage the government of Romania to allow all voices to
be heard as the process of reform and the transition to a new
government progress,'' said Dillen, reading a prepared statement.
   On Tuesday, Andrew Natsios, director of the U.S. AID Office for
Foreign Disaster Assistance, said that private citizens were
welcome to help, but that ``the best way to get assistance to
Romania is through cash donations.''
   ``Concerned citizens are urged not to donate goods or supplies,
which are sometimes inappropriate and tend to clog relief supply
lines,'' Natsios said on Tuesday.
   U.S. officials, who recognized the new government on Monday,
expressed regret that Romanian revolutionaries did not hold an open
trial for Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who were executed on
Christmas day.
   ``We would have preferred it if there had been a public trial,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   State Department officials said they had been in contact with
Romanian Ambassador Ion Stoichici, who announced over Christmas
weekend that the embassy staff had switched allegiances to the new
government.
   Stoichici kept the doors of the embassy closed Tuesday but said
he was helping Romanians who wanted to return home.
   ``We have the same feelings as other Romanians,'' said
Stoichici, who declared his loyalty to the new government on
Saturday, before the outcome of the fighting was clear.
   Another embassy officer, Vasile Leca, said ``all the staff ...
condemn the crimes that were done to the Romanian people by Nicolae
and Elena Ceausescu.''
   Stoichici and Leca refused to allow a reporter inside the
embassy, speaking instead through iron bars on a window.
   Splattered, frozen eggs coated the white brick walls of the
embassy, a turn-of-century mansion on Sheridan Circle along Embassy
Row.
   Wooden police barricades and yellow plastic tape stretched
alongside the sidewalk where over the weekend scores of Romanians
vented their rage against Ceausescu's 24-year rule.
   The ambassador said his first order of business was to ``work to
improve relations with the United States,'' which had grown
increasingly critical of Ceausescu's human rights policies.
   ``Las evening, the State Department informed us that they
recognized the staff of the Romanian Embassy'' as representative of
the new government, said Stoichici. He said he was in telephone
contact with U.S. authorities.
   A State Department official said no meetings were scheduled
between Stoichici and U.S. diplomats.
   ``They are in telephone contact with us, but when we call them,
they don't answer,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Press calls to the embassy were not answered, either.
   Romanian consular officials were accepting, through the barred
window, visa applications from Romanian-Americans who wanted to
return home.

   The order will affect about 117 state-chartered S&amp;L offices.
Currently, no junk bond sales are taking place in any California
thrift offices, although such practices have occurred in the past,
Davis said.
   ``Just so no one gets that idea in mind, we are saying you can't
do it,'' Davis said Tuesday. ``We just don't think it is a good
idea.''
   An estimated 23,000 investors _ mostly retirees in Southern
California _ claim they lost nearly $250 million when they
purchased uninsured corporate bonds sold by American Continental
Corp., primarily through the 26 offices of Lincoln Savings, its
wholly owned subsidiary.
   The Irvine-based thrift was seized in April by federal
regulators. The takeover is expected to cost $2.5 billion, the
nation's largest thrift bailout.
   Many investors said that because the bonds were sold at savings
and loan offices, they assumed they were insured against loss. The
bonds, sold in 1987 and 1988, now are considered virtually
worthless.
   Davis said similar rules on the sale of junk bonds are
apparently being drafted by the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision
and by the U.S. Savings and Loan League, a trade association for
the industry.
   John Jones, a spokesman in Washington for the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said Wednesday he didn't know of any such orders.
   The chairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission,
Richard Breeden, suggested earlier this year that Congress consider
a ban on junk bond sales from S&amp;L offices. New regulations passed
by Congress already require S&amp;Ls to get rid of their own junk-bond
investments by 1994; those rules don't apply to companies that are
using S&amp;L offices to sell junk bonds to the public.
   At Lincoln, the actual approval to sell the bonds was given by
the state Department of Corporations, which is under fire for its
role.
   With that approval, the state Savings and Loan Department gave
Lincoln Savings permission to lease space in each of its offices
for employees of American Continental to sell the bonds.
   ``There was nothing illegal or illicit about what they were
doing,'' Davis said. But many of the senior citizens were not
knowledgeable enough to realize the risk they were taking, he added.

<HEAD>20 Prisons Affected in Strikes for Amnesty, Better Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inmates demanding better living
conditions and amnesties staged hunger strikes or other protests in
at least 20 prisons across the country Wednesday.
   Opposition leaders, many of them former prisoners themselves,
said they were working with the Justice Ministry in reviewing
inmate grievances and would propose an amnesty for some prisoners.
   Any amnesty would have to be granted by the president, who is to
be elected Friday. Vaclav Havel, a leader in the opposition Civic
Forum, is the only candidate.
   The prisoners' demands vary widely but focus on living
conditions. Petr Pospichal, a Civic Forum spokesman, said many of
the demands were legitimate.
   ``Many of us have experience in this situation personally,'' he
said, referring to several members of Czechoslovakia's reform
government, including Havel, who once were imprisoned for dissident
activities.
   The non-violent protests began Friday when 2,500 inmates at
Leopoldov Prison east of Prague began a hunger strike demanding a
general amnesty.
   By Wednesday, the hunger strike had spread to 16 prisons in the
Czech republic and four in the Slovak republic, according to the
Justice Ministry and the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo.
   Some prisoners waved banners advocating non-violence.
   ``The protest is spreading so fast it's impossible to monitor,''
said Pospichal.
   He said Civic Forum would ask that some sentences be reduced and
some prisoners released.
   All political prisoners were released from Czechoslovak jails
under an amnesty granted by hard-line Communist President Gustav
Husak before he resigned Dec. 9. That amnesty covered 800 to 2,000
inmates.
   Popsichal said he did not know how many prisoners might be
affected by a future amnesty but said six inmates sentenced in
secret trials for espionage would be included on Civic Forum's list
of those deserving amnesty.
   ``The president is the only one who can decide about whether to
grant amnesty, and the scope is his decision,'' Pospichal said.
   The Czechoslovak government, meanwhile, announced plans for
lavish inaugural festivities, including an outdoor ball, following
Parliament's presidential vote Friday.
   Havel, a playwright and former dissident, is the unchallenged
candidate and would be Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist
president in 41 years.
   The election is the crowning victory of a peaceful revolution
that began Nov. 17 and ended four decades of Communist domination,
ousted hard-line Communist leaders, and installed a reformist
government to plan for free elections next year.

   Suspicious packages prompted authorities to seal off the area
around a county judge's home in North Carolina and to evacuate a
federal building in Mississippi today as a bomb scare in the
Southeast widened.
   The package Mecklenburg County District Judge Bill Constangy
found on his porch this morning in Charlotte, N.C., contained only
a doll, Assistant Police Chief D.R. Stone said after authorities
destroyed it.
   An X-ray had revealed some electrical and mechanical
connections, presumably inside the doll, officials said.
   Greenville, Miss., police took a suspicious mailed package found
by a Postal Service worker this morning to an unpopulated area.
Officials said they would wait for a postal inspector to arrive
from Memphis, Tenn., before deciding whether to detonate it.
   ``It hasn't been positively identified as an explosive device,''
Freddy Lee, chief deputy U.S. marshal, said from Oxford.
   The federal building in downtown Greenville, where the Post
Office is located, was evacuated temporarily.
   The package had no return address and officials wouldn't
disclose the addressee.
   Officials were concerned because of recent mail or package bombs
directed against judges or courts in Alabama, Georgia and Maryland.
   Constangy, like other targets, had taken some controversial
stands. He had called himself a pro-life Democrat before hearing a
case involving anti-abortion protesters and, in November, was sued
by the North Carolina Civil Liberties Union and other lawyers over
his practice of opening court with a prayer.

<TEXT>
   A 33-year-old Christmas episode of ``I Love
Lucy'' made the Top 10 in the Nielsen ratings and was CBS'
highest-rated show for the week ended Dec. 24.
   The show, starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, was sixth in the
ratings. It was the first telecast of the black and white episode
since Dec. 24, 1956.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was the top show, ABC's ``Roseanne'' was
second, and to the surprise of no one, NBC was the top-ranked
network overall. CBS pulled its own surprise by finishing second
for the second week in a row. ABC was third.
   Fox Broadcasting's ``Married ... With Children'' plunged to a
tie for 72nd place after the series' Christmas special the week
before was 13th. That was the highest rank achieved so far by a Fox
show.
   It was not a great week for Christmas specials, other than the
demonstration that Lucy can still pull in an audience. CBS'
``Frosty the Snowman'' was 20th, CBS' ``A Very Brady Christmas''
was 21st. CBS' ``Charlie Brown Christmas'' tied for 30th, CBS'
``Claymation Christmas'' tied for 41st, NBC's ``Christmas in
Washington'' tied for 56th, and CBS' ``A Christmas Carol'' tied for
62nd. The latter tied with a rerun of ``Murder, She Wrote,''
usually one of CBS' highest-rated series.
   The ABC movie ``Santa Claus: The Movie'' was 64th and the CBS
telecast of ``The Christmas Gift,'' the pilot movie for ``The
Waltons,'' tied for 65th. ABC's ``Julie Andrews: The Sound of
Christmas,'' tied for 70th, NBC's ``Magical World of Disney: A
Muppet Family Christmas'' was 74th and Fox's ``Simpsons Christmas''
was 75th.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
12.8, CBS was second with 11.7 and ABC third with 11.3. The ratings
represent the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million households
tuned to a show.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with 14.8, ABC is second with
13.1 and CBS third with 12.2.
   Here is the Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's
``Dear John,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``A Different
World,'' CBS' ``I Love Lucy'' Christmas special, ABC's NFL Monday
Night Football _ Philadelphia vs. New Orleans, NBC's ``L.A. Law,''
NBC's ``Heat of the Night'' and CBS' ``Murphy Brown'' tied.
   The American invasion of Panama and the revolution in Romania
made for a big week in news. ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' first
for the 12th week, got its highest rating since the week ended Feb.
3. ABC led with 11.8, CBS was second with 11.0 and NBC was third
with 10.8.
   The lowest-rated show of the week was ABC's ``Life Goes On.''
Here are the five bottom network shows: NBC's ``Alf,'' NBC's
``Magical World of Disney: A Muppet Family Christmas,'' NBC's
``Bill Cosby Salutes Alvin Ailey,'' ABC's ``Free Spirit'' and ABC's
``Life Goes On.''

<TEXT>
   The man who was driving the pickup truck
in which former New York Yankee manager Billy Martin was killed was
legally intoxicated at the time of the accident, a prosecutor said
today.
   Results of the blood-alcohol test support the charge that
William Reedy was drunk when he drove Martin's truck off the road
outside Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, Kevin Guyette of
the Broome County district attorney's office said.
   Guyette refused to say what Reedy's blood alcohol level was, but
he said Reedy was charged under the New York state law that says a
person is intoxicated when his blood-alcohol level is at least 0.10
percent.
   Martin, 61, died Christmas night when the truck in which he was
a passenger skidded off an icy rural road and into a ditch outside
his farm.
   Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium,
remained in a hospital with a broken hip and possible broken ribs.
   Martin's funeral is scheduled for Friday morning at St.
Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. Burial plans are pending.
   Investigators said it wasn't relevant whether Martin, as well
known for his barroom brawls as for his managerial prowess, had
been drinking before the accident because he was a passenger in his
own truck when it crashed.
   Reedy, a long-time Martin friend, was charged with driving while
intoxicated, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday
congratulated Romania's new president, Ion Iliescu, and said he was
``amazed and respectful'' of the changes there. The White House
said more humanitarian aid is on the way.
   ``My concern is for tranquility and freedom in Romania,'' Bush
said at an airport news conference here as he began a six-day
hunting and fishing vacation.
   At the same time, he declined to criticize harshly the quick
executions of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife.
   ``We did say that we were concerned that the trial of Ceausescu
should have been more open, but that's their matter,'' Bush said.
   He said he was ``just amazed and respectful of the change that
has taken place'' in the final hardline East bloc nation to undergo
democratic upheaval.
   The president said he was especially ``touched'' at hearing
about a Christmas carol being sung on the state-run television for
the first time in 40 years.
   ``It made a dramatic statement to me,'' Bush said.
   Bush said the army appeared to be restoring stability in the
violence-torn country.
   Bush also sent a congratulatory message to Iliescu.
   ``The president expressed his sympathy over the tragic bloodshed
during the past two weeks and his hope that Romania will now move
along on a peaceful path of democratic change,'' the vacation White
House said in a statement.
   In his message, Bush ``expressed the hope that the new Romanian
government will move quickly to implement democratic reforms based
on the rule of law.''
   ``He pledged U.S. support and assistance as Romania meets these
challenges during the difficult transition ahead.''
   The administration was sending a C-141 cargo plane loaded with
medical supplies from West Germany to Romania on Thursday, the
Agency for International Development (AID) said.
   The cost of the flight and supplies, about $250,000, was in
addition to the $500,000 in cash the administration was giving to
the International Red Cross for medical supplies and other
humanitarian aid, and $25,000 from an embassy contingency fund in
Romania.
   AID also said a team of experts from Washington was to arrive in
Romania Thursday ``to assess humanitarian needs to distribute the
relief flight's cargo.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Mark Dillen said the U.S.
ambassador to Bucharest, Alan Green, had requested an appointment
with the provisional president, Ion Iliescu, but no appointment had
been scheduled.
   Commenting on reports of an anti-Communist rally in the Romanian
capital, Dillen said the embassy had said the demonstration was
attended by 500 to 1,000 students and that a student leader had
appeared on Romanian television.
   ``We encourage the government of Romania to allow all voices to
be heard as the process of reform and the transition to a new
government progresses,'' said Dillen, reading a prepared statement.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced
Wednesday he will proceed with plans to dismantle the Justice
Department's organized crime strike forces despite some
congressional claims the move is unwarranted.
   Starting Jan. 1, the 14 strike forces will be folded into 23
U.S. attorneys offices across the country, Thornburgh said in a
statement.
   ``I am convinced that this new organizational structure will not
only strengthen our efforts against traditional organized criminal
families, but will enhance our efforts against new organized crime
elements,'' Thornburgh said.
   Additionally, Thornburgh said he would create an Organized Crime
Council in Washington to oversee the federal goverment's attack on
organized crime.
   He defended the reorganization, which had been revealed
previously, on the grounds that traditional organized crime run by
Mafia families has changed, with the mob often working in tandem
with Colombian drug cartels and others.
   Moreover, organized crime is also operated by elements in the
Asian community and gangs ``such as the Crips and Bloods and the
Jamaican posses.''
   In letters to members of the House and Senate judiciary
committees, Thornburgh also said his plan ``offers substantial
managerial benefits that should not longer be postponed.''
   Earlier, he said the plan would end ``turf battles'' between the
strike forces and the U.S. attorneys' offices.

   Solidarity lawmakers proposed
constitutional amendments Wednesday that include restoring the
country's name to the prewar ``Republic of Poland,'' from the
Communist-imposed ``People's Republic of Poland.''
   Parliament convened Wednesday for a three-day session to
consider sweeping economic legislation that was proposed earlier
this month by the Solidarity-led government to transform the
economy to a market system.
   The government hopes by the end of the session that parliament
will pass wide-ranging laws that aim to reduce the current 900
percent inflation rate, make the zloty a convertible currency and
reform the bloated state sector.
   In addition to the name change, the constitutional amendments
would remove 19 articles, including one saying the Polish People's
Republic is a socialist state and another that mandates the leading
role of the Communist Party in state affairs.
   The prewar Republic of Poland was changed to the People's
Republic of Poland in July 1944 when Soviet-backed Polish
communists entered the country and proclaimed a Communist
government in Poland.
   The package also calls for dropping the phrase that says the
``Polish People's Republic will strengthen friendship with the
Soviet Union and other socialist countries'' as well as removing a
clause which refers to the socialist system in the Polish economy.
   The amendments were presented first to the Solidarity deputies
by caucus leader Bronislaw Geremek who appealed to the union-backed
deputies to be present for the debate in parliament.
   Geremek said an amended Constitution would serve as a temporary
one until a new Constitution could be drafted. The amendments must
receive a two-thirds majority of the Sejm, as the lower house of
parliament is called, to pass.
   The amendments also would create a provision for the formation
of new political parties. As it is now worded, the Constitution
allows only the Communist Party, the Democratic Party and the
Peasants Party to operate legally.
   After the Solidarity-led opposition and Communist authorities
agreed to partially free elections at talks this spring,
union-backed candidates to parliament were forced to organize
themselves as a club rather than a political party because of the
wording in the Constitution.

   Like thousands of Houstonians, Linda Woods spent
the Christmas holidays bedeviled by problems caused by the record
cold.
   On Saturday morning, the pipes in her attic froze.
   ``No coffee, no shower, nothing,'' she said. The single mother
packed up her two children and went to her mother's home, which had
water.
   After an hour, the electricity went out as utilities were
overloaded by the demand for heat.
   Two hours later, the family went shopping to keep warm at a mall.
   ``We were there about an hour and all their lights went off,''
Ms. Woods said.
   When they returned to her mother's home, the water was off
because a pump station lost power.
   The family went to a hotel Sunday morning, with the kids amusing
themselves ``by feeding about $20 in quarters into the Magic
Fingers thing on the motel bed while Mom and I played cards.''
   When the family returned to Ms. Woods' mother's house on
Christmas Day, there was electricity but no water.
   On Tuesday, Ms. Woods and her children went home to find her
pipes thawed _ and her kitchen and living room flooded because the
ice had ruptured the pipes.
   ``The phone still worked, so I called my mom and said, `Mom,
come on over _ I've got water,'' she joked.
   Paul Harrison, a 24-year-old University of Houston student, had
been excited when his parents from the Texas Panhandle decided to
visit for the holidays for the first time.
   But then the electricity went off Saturday and the water
dwindled to a rusty trickle.
   ``The really bad part was, I've called them every week since
I've been here and gloated over the weather,'' Harrison said. ``I
really wish I hadn't done that.''

<TEXT>
   The cold snap may have had at least one
beneficial effect by putting the chill on next summer's bug
population.
   The record cold last week and over the weekend may have killed
off large quantities of fleas, ticks, gnats, mosquitoes and flies,
said Frank Funderburk, a Bibb County extension agent.
   ``It's hard to say what nature is going to do, but the insects
that bother man should be less in number early in the summer,'' he
said.
   The bug population could be back by late summer, Funderburk
said. And household pests, such as cockroaches, probably won't be
affected by the cold, he said.
   The cold also may have slowed the spread of a virus that damages
peanuts, tomatoes and peppers, Sumter County Extension Agent Tim
Lawson said. The virus is carried by aphids and thrips, insects
susceptible to low temperatures, he said.
   Georgia's peaches may have gotten a boost from the cold. Peach
grower Robert Dickey of Musella said the cold was a good down
payment on the 850 hours of ``chilling'' temperatures the trees
need.
   ``It couldn't be anything but beneficial to us peach growers,''
he said. ``Last winter we didn't get the adequate chilling required
and that was one reason our peach crop came up real short.''

   On the 100th anniversary of the Eiffel
Tower, mock charges calculated to wound French pride claim the
Parisian landmark was copied from an ordinary light tower in San
Jose.
   The claim, a just-for-fun charge filed with San Jose's mock
Court of Historical Inquiry, was brought against the estate of
Alexandre Gustave Eiffel and demanded all profits the French have
received since the 984-foot iron framework structure opened to
sightseers at the Paris Exposition of 1889.
   The ``trial'' was set for Jan. 25.
   The complaint says Eiffel got his idea for the tower after being
stricken dumb with admiration upon gazing at a now-defunct,
208-foot light tower at a San Jose intersection in 1881. The claim
does not say what business Eiffel, an engineer, had in the orchard
capital of Northern California.
   The claim will be prosecuted by Santa Clara County Deputy
District Attorney Paul R. Bernal, who admitted his case was built
on hearsay and not a hint of direct evidence.
   ``It was rumored at the time the light tower was built that
Gustave Eiffel came to see it. ... We are going to substantiate
that rumor,'' Bernal heatedly told reporters.
   Lawyer Jacques Dulin pledged to defend the French origin of the
tower, describing the San Jose version as puny.
   ``We,'' he fumed, ``gave (the Americans) the Statue of Liberty.
We did not give them the liberty to steal any of the other
monuments of France.''

   ``It's becoming very chic to have a scarf or sweater made from

   Two years ago, Mikel turned her hobby of spinning yarn into a
venture called Traditional Homespuns. She makes and sells such
items as clothing and throw rugs.
   Mikel uses yarn made from the more than 30 Angora rabbits she
and her husband, Jim, raise in their barn for scarves, sweaters and
mittens.
   She also experiments with various combinations using Angora,
sheep's wool, mohair, cotton yarns, and soon, dog hair.
   For her first experiment with dog hair, Mikel said, she will use
fur from her pet Afghan, Oliver.

   A top official declared Wednesday that
Romania is no longer a Communist country, and revolutionary leaders
tried to stop citizens from waging a ``witch hunt'' of revenge
against supporters of the old regime.
   Security police still loyal to executed leader Nicolae Ceausescu
attacked the television building in the capital early Wednesday but
were repulsed in a half-hour firefight, news reports said.
   The television building is the headquarters of the provisional
government headed by new President Ion Iliescu, who on Wednesday
spoke with Mikhail S. Gorbachev and expressed his thanks for the
Soviet leader's support. The men are friends from their college
days in Moscow.
   Dumitru Mazilu, vice chairman of the National Salvation
Committee provisional government, reaffirmed that the new leaders
are devoted to replacing Ceausescu's 24-year Stalinist despotism
with democracy.
   The government has said free elections will be held in April.
   ``We want Romania to become a member of the free civilized
world,'' Mazilu said. ``Romania is no longer a Communist country.
Romania is a free land, and we will create a real democracy.''
   But the revolutionary government still is fighting a guerrilla
war with Ceausescu loyalists, although the battles are waning.
   Romanian news reports said security police were holding out in
``isolated positions'' in other parts of the country, but army
forces backing the revolt were for the most part in control.
   Trying to heal the wounds of Romania's revolution, the interim
leadership offered the possibility of lenient penalties to
Ceausescu's security forces if they surrendered.
   But there were suggestions those who did not give up could face
the same fate as the Ceausescus, who were reported executed by
firing squad on Monday.
   According to a communique read on Bucharest Radio, security
police members have until Thursday afternoon to surrender or
they'll be ``tried and condemned'' by special tribunals.
   ``If they surrender voluntarily, with their weapons, they will
be tried and the death penalty will not be applied,'' the
communique said.
   Loyalist Ceausescu forces have been launching their attacks in
Bucharest from a maze of tunnels built by the dictator for the
feared security police.
   On Wednesday night, Romanian TV showed nervous soldiers combing
the tunnels in search of members of the security police, known as
the Securitate.
   The soldiers found bottles of whiskey, radio equipment, food and
weapons caches, and at least one gas mask _ but no security police.
The army troops kicked open doors leading to small rooms in the
tunnels.
   At one point, a young soldier tipped back his helmet and wiped
his brow after forcing his way into one of the rooms. His
frightened expression reflected Romanians' fear of the Securitate.
   Unconfirmed reports have said Ceausescu's police have walked
into hospitals hiding knives to carry out acts of terrorism, and
poisoned village wells.
   There have been reports that Securitate forces have been
surrendering en masse after battling army units backing the
revolution and armed citizens. However, there have been no figures
on how many Ceausescu loyalists have given up.
   Elsewhere, Romanian TV on Wednesday showed workers taking down
Communist Party signs and slogans from buildings in Bucharest.
   Corneliu Bogdan, Romania's new deputy foreign minister, said
that while bureaucrats who worked for years under Ceausescu still
are in positions of power, the new government wants a clean,
peaceful break with the past.
   ``They are not all criminals, they were at the most too servile
and obedient. We must try to avoid a witch hunt at any costs,'' he
said.
   The governing committee headed by Iliescu, a former Communist
Party secretary ousted for challenging Ceausescu, is made up of
dissidents, intellectuals and disaffected army commanders and
former government officials.
   In their conversation, Iliescu told Gorbachev the situation in
Romania was returning to normal and that 90 percent of the
factories were back at work, the Soviet news agency Tass said. It
said Iliescu thanked Gorbachev for a resolution passed by Soviet
lawmakers expressing support for the revolution at a time when its
outcome was in doubt.
   The National Salvation Committee named a new foreign minister,
university professor Sergiu Celac, 58. His predecessor, Ion Stoian,
has been ousted with Ceausescu's ruling cabal.
   Relief flights were arriving in Romania as the country struggled
to recover from nearly two weeks of upheaval. At Bucharest airport,
more than 40 relief aircraft had arrived by Wednesday.
   ``There is even too much aid,'' said Bernard Kouchner, French
minister for humanitarian affairs. ``We have to decide what is
needed and then coordinate.''
   The revolution began with a protest in the western town of
Timisoara on Dec. 15, and escalated into huge demonstrations in
which thousands are believed to have been slain.
   Thousands were reported massacred by troops in Timisoara and
dumped into mass graves. During his trial, Ceausescu was accused of
being responsible for the killing of 60,000 people during his
24-year reign.
   Ceausescu fled his palace Friday after army units joined the
revolt. Since then, the revolutionary government has been fighting
urban guerrilla attacks by secret police. He was captured Saturday.
   President Bush said he was ``amazed'' at the changes that have
taken place in Romania. ``We did say we were concerned that the
trial of Ceausescu should have been more open, but that's their
matter,'' he said.
   Petre Roman, the country's new interim prime minister, defended
the secret trial and quick executions of Ceausescu and his wife,
Elena.
   ``We were in circumstances which did not permit us to wait
longer in a situation of instability. There were pressures. We had
information concerning possible attacks on the place where he
was,'' Roman told French TV.
   Roman previously has said there had been indications secret
police were making plans to try to free Ceausescu.
   At the once-prestigious university library, 500,000 volumes,
including some precious manuscripts, were burned in a fire sparked
by the fighting.
   But at the National Library, the only books destroyed were six
long shelves of the works of Ceausescu: pages upon pages of his
revised Stalinist socialism.
   From the first signs of Ceausescu's forced departure Friday,
staff members began baling the dusty volumes to be destroyed.
   ``No one ever read this stuff, no one,'' said Virgil Tiberiu
Spanu, director of acquisitions. ``Never.''
   Romanians were exultant Wednesday after state TV showed the
Ceausescus being tried, as well as photos of the couple lying dead
next to a bullet-riddled wall.
   The firing squad was eager to execute the couple, according to a
man who said he was on the tribunal that tried the Ceausescus.
   ``We weren't even able to film (the execution) because the
soldiers lost control, they could no longer wait to fire,'' the man
told the network FR3 in from Bucharest. He declined to give his
name but who appeared to be the same man who was shown on Romanian
TV with Iliescu last week.
   Bogdan Lazaraen, a 21-year-old engineering student, shook his
head when asked about the executions.
   ``A week ago he was screaming at us and calling us fascists and
terrorists,'' he said. ``And now to see him lying in some obscure
place, shot.''

   Sinhalese radicals stormed a wedding
party in southern Sri Lanka and stabbed to death four guests whom
they accused of being government spies, military officials said
Wednesday.
   Thirty-two other people, including some Sinhalese extremists,
were reported killed since Tuesday in violence inspired by
Sinhalese militants of the People's Liberation Front.
   The wedding party attack occurred Tuesday night in Urubokke, 85
miles south of Colombo, the officials said. All the victims were
Sinhalese men, and all the killers escaped.
   In the nearby city of Tangalle, extremists blew up a truck
Wednesday, killing three policemen and a soldier, the officials
said without elaboration.
   Also Wednesday, extremists shot to death two supporters of the
governing United National Party.
   The truck explosion occurred hours after police found the burned
bodies of 13 young Sinhalese men who had been shot.
   It was not known who killed the men, but the method was similar
to that used by vigilante groups who allegedly kill civilians
suspected of associating with the radical People's Liberation Front.
   Government troops killed 12 front members in three separate
incidents since Tuesday in central and southern Sri Lanka,
officials said.
   Sinhalese extremists began a violent campaign in 1987 to protest
an accord the government approved in an effort to end a war by
minority Tamils demanding more autonomy.
   Ultranationalist Sinhalese claimed the Sinhalese-controlled
government made too many concessions to the Tamils, who comprise 18
percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   At least 11,000 people have died in the Tamil insurrection,
while another 6,000 have been killed in the Sinhalese backlash.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population. Tamils say the
Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs, education and use of
the language.

<TEXT>
   The Panama Canal has been
increasing its working hours gradually as employees return to work,
but 125 ships were backed up Wednesday waiting to cross the
isthmus, a canal official said.
   The canal was shut down to all ship traffic for the first 48
hours after U.S. troops invaded Panama Dec. 20. It resumed
operation during daylight hours, but halted work at night because
not enough employees could get to work.
   ``Some people are actually walking to work, as much as 15 miles,
because there's no public transport,'' said Willie K. Friar, a
spokeswoman at Panama Canal Commission headquarters just west of
Panama City.
   But there is still a bottleneck of ships from around the world
at the Atlantic and Pacific entrances waiting to pass through the
canal, she said.
   ``We have 125 ships waiting,'' Ms. Friar said.
   Buses and taxis have begun cruising Panama City streets, but
gasoline is hard to find following a looting spree.
   U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia said gasoline was being
distributed to service stations as life slowly returned to normal.
   Panama City is on the canal's southern end along the Pacific
Ocean, and the town of Colon is on the canal's northern mouth on
the Atlantic coast.
   The canal normally can handle 42 ships a day. Under its 12-hour
daylight operations, only 12 ships a day passed through, Ms. Friar
said.
   On Tuesday, as more employees returned to work, the canal began
work at 3 a.m. and stopped operations 16 hours later.
   ``Today (Wednesday) we're hoping to go to 24 hours, but we don't
know,'' Ms. Friar said. ``We are now assessing the number of
employees'' that have shown up for work.
   Neither the canal nor any ships suffered damage during the
fighting, she said.
   In 1988, 12,261 ships went through the canal. There are 7,602
full-time employees, of whom 86 percent are Panamanians.
   Last week's closing was the first time the canal has shut down
for anything but natural disaster since its opening in 1914.
   The commission has both U.S. and Panamanian members. Under a
1977 treaty, the United States will turn over operation of the
canal to Panama at the end of 1999.

   A former cook at a restaurant owned by
Chuck Berry has filed a lawsuit accusing the rock 'n' roll legend
of secretly videotaping women using the restroom.
   Hosana A. Huck, who worked at the Southern Air in Wentzville,
about 30 miles from St. Louis, said that she and other employees
and customers were taped and that it humiliated her and caused her
emotional distress.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday in state court seeks unspecified
damages.
   Berry, 63, who lives near Wentzville, was unavailable for
comment. Calls to his restaurant went unanswered Wednesday.
   The suit alleges that the videotapes ``were created for the
improper purpose of the entertainment and gratification'' of
Berry's ``sexual fetishes and sexual predilections.''
   The duck-walking guitarist is known for such hits as ``Roll Over
Beethoven'' and ``Johnny B. Goode.''

   Romania's new president thanked Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday for backing the revolution that
ended 24 years of Stalinist dictatorship in the East bloc nation,
Tass said.
   Romania's provisional revolutionary leader, Ion Iliescu, spoke
with Gorbachev by telephone and expressed appreciation for a
supportive Soviet resolution that came at the height of the revolt,
the Soviet news agency said.
   Iliescu and Gorbachev reportedly are old friends from their
college days in Moscow.
   Iliescu is leader of the National Salvation Committee that took
power in Romania after the downfall of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
The revolutionary government says it is a provisional leadership
until free elections are held in April.
   Ceausescu was forced to flee his palace on Friday but fierce
fighting between loyalist and revolutionary forces left the outcome
of the insurrection in doubt for days.
   Gorbachev, speaking to the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies
on Friday, suggested that a resolution be approved urging support
for the Romanian people's ``just cause.'' Iliescu reportedly was
particularly grateful for that support.
   Iliescu also told Gorbachev the situation in Romania was
returning to normal and that 90 percent of the factories were back
at work, Tass said.
   On Tuesday, Gorbachev congratulated Iliescu on his election as
head of the National Salvation Committee at a time when patriots
are trying to rescue the nation from ``forces of terror.''
   Gorbachev's message in the Communist Party newspaper Izvestia
was strikingly different from the usual formal congratulations of a
new leader because it was signed simply M. Gorbachev, with no title.
   ``You have taken the leadership of the country in a very
difficult hour for it, when the Romanian patriots have decisively
moved to rescue the nations from the forces of disorder and terror,
in order to install a truly democratic order in your country,''
Gorbachev's statement said.
   He went on to assure Iliescu that the Romanians ``will receive
the full support of the peoples and the leadership of the Soviet
Union on their road to renewal.''
   Gorbachev and Iliescu reportedly knew each other as university
students in Moscow three decades ago. Iliescu was a leader in the
Romanian Communist Party until criticizing Ceausescu.
   Still, the Soviet recognition of an informal government was
unusual and indicative of Gorbachev's efforts to clear out the
vestiges of Stalinism in the East bloc. Reform movements with tacit
Soviet approval have ousted regimes in Poland, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and East Germany.
   In East Berlin, a former aide to ousted East German leader Erich
Honecker said Wednesday that Gorbachev had a hand in ousting
hard-line East German leader Erich Honecker. Gorbachev reportedly
urged Honecker to embrace reform during the Soviet leader's state
visit in October. The former Honecker aide said the visit prompted
dissidents on the Politburo to force Honecker from power.
   However, Gorbachev also has not hestitated to issued mild
warnings when the pace of reform threatens the Warsaw Pact
alliance. The Soviets expressed some caution when a non-Communist
government took power in Poland and when West German leaders began
pushing for reunification with East Germany.

   Mexico denied on Wednesday allegations by U.S.
officials that its territory has been used by Cuba to transport
weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   An official Mexican source rejected the allegation
``categorically'' because Mexico has built up a ``surveillance
infrastructure'' to avoid use of its territory for such purchases.
   U.S. officials have said that there are strong indications that
Cuban-supplied weaponry is being sent to the Salvadoran rebels via
a remote route that begins in the Yucatan Peninsula.
   The Mexican source, asking not to be identified, called the
statements by the U.S. officials ``irresponsible, lacking in
substance and false.''
   The State Department declined comment on whether Cuba has been
using Mexican territory to arm the Salvadoran rebels but said it
would not be surprising if Cuba sought new ways to transport
supplies to the insurgents.
   The administration has said Cuba traditionally has sent supplies
to the rebels via Nicaragua.

   Disney let Captain Hook and Captain Nemo wear
mustaches, but First Officer John Magness of the Queen Mary _ the
only real-life seaman of the three _ was ordered Wednesday to shave
it off or ship out.
   Magness, the No. 3 officer on the Disney-operated ship, was sent
home on a one-day suspension for violating the Walt Disney Co.'s
grooming policy, which forbids beards and mustaches.
   If Magness goes ahead with plans to keep his mustache, by next
week he will have run out of suspensions and will join three other
crew members _ two waiters and a busboy _ who were fired for
wearing mustaches.
   ``It's a matter of principle,'' said Magness, 65, whose mustache
is little more than a thin grey tuft. ``I've had that mustache for
42 years now. My wife wants me to keep it. My kids have not seen me
without it. So there it stays.''
   The policy is so strict that company founder, the mustachioed
Walt Disney, would be in violation, along with many famous Disney
characters, from Uncle Remus to six of the seven dwarfs. Much of
Minnie Mouse's wardrobe would be too gaudy for Disney.
   Magness, who wore his mustache in the Navy through 13
engagements in World War II and three engagements in the Korean
War, summed up his feelings for the policy in two words:
   ``It stinks.''
   The flap was the latest in several disputes over what critics
have called Disney's overly conservative practices. The
Burbank-based company, for instance, lost its battle to ban
homosexuals from dancing together at Disneyland.
   The 35-year-old grooming policy just went into effect his month
at the Disney-operated Queen Mary, permanently docked in Long Beach
Harbor, 25 miles south of Los Angeles. Two of the employees were
fired Christmas Eve.
   Disney bought the leasehold to the Queen Mary two years ago,
along with the adjacent Spruce Goose plane, built by Howard Hughes,
a billionaire with a mustache. The ship is run as an attraction,
and officers such as Magness basically are in charge of answering
visitors' questions.
   The grooming policy, which applies to all park and hotel
employees, bans mustaches, beards and long hair on men. Bright eye
shadow, red fingernails or two-toned hair on women are also
forbidden.
   Queen Mary spokesman Rich Kerlin said that enforcing the policy
was a matter of keeping the Disney empire consistent, although he
would not say why the company was so strict on facial hair.
   ``It's just that it's been a policy for 35 years,'' he remarked,
adding that Disney himself instituted the policy.
   ``If we allowed the Queen Mary employees to have mustaches, we'd
have to let the entire theme park and resort employees do the
same,'' the spokesman said.
   Kerlin said that the only exceptions to the no-mustache rule
were if an employee needed one for ``medical reasons.''
   So far, 90 of the 100 men with mustaches agreed to shave them
off. Others, like Reza Nazertehrani and Tom Nicolai, refused. They
were fired Dec. 24 from their jobs as waiters and plan to protest
the policy with their union.
   ``I feel I have a right as a person to live in the United States
_ a free country _ and to not shave my mustache,'' said
Nazertehrani. ``I am Iranian. It is part of my culture. We are very
proud to have a mustache.''

<HEAD>Lebanon Asks Hostages' Release, Complains to U.N. About Israeli Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday appealed to
all kidnappers in Lebanon to release their hostages.
   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are being held
here, most by Shiite Moslem extremists.
   In other action, Lebanon recognized the new governments in
Romania and Panama and announced it was lodging an urgent complaint
with the U.N. Security Council about new Israeli attacks that
killed 12 people and wounded 31.
   In a separate development, a high-ranking Iranian envoy called a
cease-fire late in the day to halt five days of fighting between
rival Shiite Moslem militias in south Lebanon.
   Shortly afterward, police said the fighting dwindled to sporadic
sniping.
   ``The big guns gave fallen silent, and that's a good sign. But
unless the sniping is quickly halted, the situation could explode
again,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be identified under
standing rules.
   Information Minister Edmond Rizk read the government's plea to
hostage-takers after a two-hour Cabinet meeting held under
President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Salim Hoss at an army base
in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
   ``On the occasion of Christmas and the New Year, the president,
the prime minister and the council of ministers appeal jointly to
all hostage-holders to release them,'' the official statement said.
   The plea is likely to have no impact on pro-Iranian factions
holding most of the 18 hostages because government authority has
been eroded by 14 years of civil war between Moslems and Christians.
   The hostage held the longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was abducted March
16, 1985.
   On Tuesday, Israeli ground and air attacks wiped out two
guerrilla bases of the Communist Party in central and southern
Lebanon. The ground assault was Israel's largest in Lebanon since
December 1988, and the air attack was the deadliest of 18 such
raids this year.
   Hoss' office said instructions were being transmitted to
Lebanon's U.N. mission to complain of ``this blatant aggression.''
   The complaint, issued Wednesday, reserved the right to request a
special meeting of the council, said M. Chawki Choueri, Lebanon's
permanent representative to the United Nations.
   Paratroopers backed by tanks and helicopter gunships destroyed a
guerrilla base of the Communist Party in southeast Lebanon before
dawn Tuesday and warplanes blasted a Communist command post at
sunset.
   Rescuers worked overnight to dig out victims from the rubble of
the two-story command post in Rmeile, 20 miles south of Beirut.
   Police put the final toll of the Rmeile attack at 10 killed, 28
wounded. Eighteen such air strikes have killed 28 people and
wounded 137 since Jan. 11.
   The earlier ground assault on the base in the southeastern
village of Nabi Safi killed two Communist guerrillas and wounded
three.
   In south Lebanon, the rival militias battled early Wednesday.
But Iran's first deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Ali Besharti,
said leaders of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed
Amal militias pledged to abide by the cease-fire.
   Police said eight people were killed and 37 wounded in artillery
and tank fire duels Tuesday and Wednesday. That raised the overall
toll to 46 people killed and 187 wounded since the current round of
fighting erupted Saturday.
   The two factions have vied for control over Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest sect, for more than two
years.
   Since the intermittent power struggle began in May 1987, 617
people have been killed and 1,766 wounded.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Communists to Hold Talks With Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Communists and an opposition
coalition agreed Wednesday to hold wide-ranging talks on Bulgaria's
future government. Some workers staged brief strikes as a warning
to the Communists.
   Following the agreement, an independent trade union called off a
general strike scheduled for Thursday. The union demands the
resignation of the government, the Parliament and the Communist
Party's Central Committee.
   In other developments Wednesday, the government fired Interior
Minister Georgi Tanev following criticism of police violence
against demonstrators in October. The official BTA news agency gave
no reason for his ouster.
   The announcements are the latest in a series of changes since
Bulgaria's longtime hard-line Communist leader, Todor Zhivkov, was
ousted Nov. 10.
   Since then, amid a wave of democratic reform that has swept
Eastern Europe, leaders have scrapped a law forbidding dissent,
proposed free elections in May and granted amnesty to political
prisoners.
   The ruling party reached agreement with the opposition
coalition, the Union of Democratic Forces, ``toward holding
consultations'' beginning Tuesday or Wednesday, said Ivan Angelov,
a spokesman for the Central Committee.
   The talks were characterized as being similar to those in
Czechoslovakia that led to a government dominated by non-Communists.
   For the first time in Bulgaria, strikes were held throughout the
country Wednesday, but only small groups of workers took part. The
two-hour strikes were intended as a warning to Communist leaders.
   The independent union Support withdrew its Thursday strike call
following the agreement, said chairman Konstantin Trenchev.
   Support's job action was not backed by most of the independent
organizations in the Union of Democratic Forces, which said workers
should strike only after all other forms of a dialogue are
exhausted.
   Plamen Darakchiev, a secretary of Support, said the trade union
``will not relinquish its demands but make them in a categoric
way'' at the talks with the Communists.
   BTA said Tanev was replaced as Interior Minister by Gen. Atanas
Semerdzhiev, the army's chief of staff. BTA said the deputy foreign
minister, Lyuben Gotsev, would move to the No. 2 position at the
Interior Ministry, which is responsible for the East bloc country's
police and internal security.
   Tanev, 48, was blamed for the Oct. 26 crackdown on demonstrators
of the then-banned Eco-Glasnost environmental group. The government
said at least 22 people protesting in Sofia against a government
hydroelectric project were beaten and kicked by police, and Western
diplomats said from 30 to 40 were detained.
   The police action embarrassed the Bulgarian leadership because
it drew sharp criticism from delegates to a 35-nation ecological
forum in Sofia taking place at the time. The group was later
legalized.
   At the last session of the Parliament on Dec. 14, Tanev read a
long statement on the incident, rejecting all responsibility. He
said he had only learned of the police action afterward.
   Under Tanev, a police squad that cracked down on human rights
activists and political opponents was in operation. Under new
Communist leader Petar Mladenov, it was disbanded Nov. 25.

<HEAD>Peru Resumes Joint Drug-Fighting Efforts With United States</HEAD>

   Peru has decided to resume joint anti-drug
operations with the United States, a week after the Peruvian leader
halted the activity to protest the invasion of Panama, the Justice
Department said Wednesday.
   David Runkel, a department spokesman, said the ``reconstituted
joint efforts in Peru'' between Drug Enforcement Administration and
Peruvian officials began Tuesday.
   The Peruvian Embassy said joint operations resumed because ``the
fight against drugs is so important.'' '
   The anti-drug operations ceased after the U.S. invasion of
Panama on Dec. 20. Peruvian officials called the invasion an
``outrage against Latin America.''
   At the time, Peruvian President Alan Garcia said he would
boycott the Feb. 15 drug summit that is to be held in Colombia.
President Bush plans to attend.
   An embassy official, speaking on condition he remain anonymous,
said he didn't know whether Garcia had changed his mind and would
attend.
   Bush, talking to reporters as he began a vacation in Texas
Wednesday, said, ``I would hope that Garcia would change his
mind.'' He said that ``inasmuch as Peru is an Andean country and
this is an Andean summit with the United States participating,
trying to help them, I would think it would be lessened _ you know,
less inclusive, obviously _ but I'd think that there are ways to
continue to help Peru in this fight.''
   The Peruvian embassy official said Peruvian officials intend to
send representatives to a meeting in Bolivia on Jan. 10 at which
officials from Bogota, Quito and Lima will coordinate strategy for
the drug summit.
   The United States finances a number of joint operations aimed at
wiping out the drug trade from Peru. They include anti-drug patrols
in the Upper Huallaga Valley where most of the Peruvian coca leaf
is derived. Cocaine is derived from coca.
   DEA agents also work on joint paramilitary operations with the
Peruvians and help them with investigations, including locating
drug traffickers.

   Federal investigators Wednesday began
examining the wreckage of a commuter plane for the cause of a crash
that killed all six people aboard.
   The twin-engine United Express turboprop went down in a field
and burst into flames just short of the runway late Tuesday while
en route from Seattle to Pasco via Yakima.
   At a news conference, United Express president Craig Belmondo
raised the possibility that wing icing contributed to the crash but
said it was ``much too early to speculate'' on the cause.
   Fire officials found ice at the crash scene but Belmondo said it
had not been determined whether the ice came from the British
Aerospace Jetstream 31, a 19-passenger plane.
   The crew contacted the airline's dispatch center at the Tri City
Airport here within three to five miles of landing, as is routine,
and gave no indication of a problem, Belmondo said. He did not know
if there was any communication between the plane and the airport
tower after that.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Dave Duff said the
plane hit 100 feet short of the runway; Belmondo said it went in
500 to 700 feet short.
   Investigators from the National Transportation safety Board and
the FAA arrived Wednesday.
   United Express has deicing equipment at Yakima but it was not
immediately known if it was used on the plane before its departure
for Pasco, a flight of about 80 miles which usually takes about 30
minutes.
   Visibility at the time of the crash was seven miles and wind was
calm, Duff said. The plane was not equipped with voice and flight
data recorders that larger commercial airlines are required to
carry.
   The plane was built in Scotland in 1987 and delivered to United
Express in December of that year, Belmondo said. It had 5,000 hours
of flight time and had its last maintenance inspection on Dec. 20,
he said.
   The aircraft had no record of any major mechanical problems, he
said.
   The pilot, Capt. Barry Roberts, 38, had more than 11 years of
regional flying experience with more than 6,600 hours of total
flying time, including more than 660 hours in British Aerospace
Jetstream aircraft, Belmondo said.
   Co-pilot Doug McInroe, 25, joined United Express in August with
more than two years flying experience, Belmondo said.
   He said he did not know who was piloting the plane when it
crashed.
   United Express, based at Pasco, serves 15 cities in Washington,
Oregon, Idaho and Montana. It began commercial service in 1987.

   The state Supreme Court won't intervene
in the case of two women at odds over their names, leaving the
small community of Salt Rock with two Shirley Bledsoes.
   The court Tuesday refused 4-1 to hear the case of Shirley Jean
Bledsoe, who asked that Shirley Rae Bledsoe be forced to change her
name.
   Shirley Jean Bledsoe contends the name has caused a mixup in
mail and telephone calls in the community of 900, situated about 10
miles from Huntington.
   The dispute began after a judge allowed Shirley Rae Lambert to
change her last name to Bledsoe in May. Shirley Rae Bledsoe said
she and her two children have used the Bledsoe name because it was
her common-law husband's.
   Shirley Jean Bledsoe argued the judge erred in granting the name
change.
   The two Bledsoe families are not related.

   A court on Wednesday ordered two major publishers
to pay $22,400 in damages for defaming Japan's first female AIDS
victim by publishing her photograph in their weekly magazines after
she died, one of the publishers said.
   The Osaka District Court ordered Kobunsha Co. and Shinchosha to
pay the damages, according to a Kobunsha official. The official
declined to discuss further details, including whether the
companies would appeal to a higher court.
   Japan's first female AIDS patient died at the age of 29 on Jan.
20, 1987. The Health and Welfare Ministry, which did not identify
the patient, listed sexual contact as the cause of her infection.
   Kyodo News Service quoted presiding Judge Yutaka Tahata as
saying in his verdict that Shinchosha's Focus magazine and
Kobunsha's Flash had defamed the woman by carrying her picture and
``groundless'' stories that invaded her privacy and harmed her
parents' respect and affection for her.
   Kyodo said the parents had filed their libel suit in September
1987 demanding $140,000 in damages.
   As of April 10, 1989, 103 people in Japan had contracted AIDS,
or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, according to Health and
Welfare Ministry figures.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most
often transmitted through sexual contact, transfusions of tainted
blood and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles by drug
abusers.

   A strike-bound coal company sued the
United Mine Workers for $60 million Wednesday, accusing the union
and its members of attempted murder, arson and extortion as part of
a nationwide racketeering scheme.
   The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Beckley by the New
Beckley Mining Corp., which also announced it will close its nearby
Glen Daniel mine because of what it called union violence stemming
from the UMW's selective strikes.
   The UMW has been on strike against New Beckley since January,
idling 130 miners. The union also is engaged in a bitter strike
against the Pittston Coal Group Inc. in West Virginia, Virginia and
Kentucky.
   The lawsuit was filed under the Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt
Organizations Act. Although the racketeering statute was intended
by Congress primarily as a tool against organized crime, it been
used frequently against unions, including a 1988 lawsuit by the
government against the the Teamsters.
   Earlier this year, the Supreme Court upheld the use of the
statute against legitimate organizations, despite complaints by the
AFL-CIO that it had become ``a tool of harassment ... against
legitimate businesses and labor organizations.''
   The New Beckley Mining lawsuit cites alleged violence at more
than 20 coal companies in West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia
since 1983, when the union began its selective strike strategy, in
which the UMW targeted specific companies for work stoppages.
Previous strikes were industrywide.
   The lawsuit alleges that New Beckley employees have been the
targets of vandalism, death threats, shootings and beatings at work
and at home.
   The violence ``pervades the coal industry, discouraging
productivity and inhibiting the economic well-being of individuals
living and working in coal-producing communities,'' the lawsuit
says.
   Union spokesman John Duray called the lawsuit ``ridiculous'' and
accused the company of engaging in a ``press-release lawsuit'' by
hiring a public relations company to notify the news media of the
filing.
   ``It looks to me like these guys are a lot more interested in
trying their case in the media than in court,'' Duray said.
   District 29 President Everett Acord said he knew nothing of the
lawsuit or the mine closing.
   At a news conference on the courthouse steps, New Beckley
President Jay Sasell said: ``The decision to shut down and seal New
Beckley's Glen Daniel Mine was reached because the continued
organized violence orchestrated against New Beckley by the UMWA has
reached an intolerable level of acceptability by any rational
standard.
   ``Marauding pickets continue to cause great hardship upon the
company and its families on a daily basis.''
   The lawsuit contends that the union has engaged in a pattern of
racketeering that includes 34 counts of attempted murder, 23 of
arson and 79 of extortion.
   Under the RICO statute, the company's requested $20 million in
damages can be tripled if the union and various individuals are
found to have violated the act.

   Authorities froze French bank accounts Wednesday
holding about $3.3 million under the names of Panama's Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega and members of his family. Switzerland
provisionally froze two bank accounts there.
   U.S. troops invaded Panama last week and deposed Noriega as
leader. Noriega, who is wanted on U.S. drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges, is penned up in the Vatican Embassy in
Panama City.
   Justice Department chief spokesman David Runkel said in
Washington that U.S. officials believe Noriega hid at least $10
million in bank accounts in Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and
Britain.
   Judge Patrick Fievet of the Paris Tribunal blocked the Noriegas
from having access to accounts at the Banque Nationale de Paris and
the Credit Industriel et Commerciale.
   He acted under a warrant issued Friday charging unidentified
people with drug-trafficking and taking part in international
financial operations related to illegal drugs.
   Investigators said the banks may have been used as transit
points for funds destined for Luxembourg or Switzerland.
   The French customs and anti-drug investigation appears to have
been based on a tip from the United States.
   In Bern, a statement issued by the Swiss Justice Ministry said a
U.S. request to Switzerland charged Noriega with illegal drug
trafficking by giving ``logistic support'' to Colombian drug lords'
shipments to the United States.
   It said that according to U.S. authorities, some of the money
Noriega received from the Colombians was paid into accounts in
Switzerland.
   Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said the U.S.request included
``precise information'' on two accounts in banks in Zurich and
Geneva. Authorities ordered a ``precautionary'' freeze on the
accounts. Kistler refused to elaborate.
   Runkel said that based on records seized in Panama, U.S.
officials think they can document that the money in the overseas
accounts stemmed from Noriega drug dealing.
   Leaders of the so-called Group of Seven industrialized nations
agreed at a Paris summit in July to cooperate more closely against
the illegal drug trade and money-laundering.
   Noriega would be the biggest target of a joint investigation
since the agreement.
   The G-7 countries include the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, Japan, Italy, and West Germany.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has been flooded with offers from
volunteers who want to go to Panama and help restore battered
public services, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Maj. Henry Fitts, a spokesman at the
U.S. Army Reserve Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, N.C.
   ``Call it patriotism, call it boredom, call it what you will,
but we've had to set up a 24-hour operation just to screen the
volunteers,'' Fitts said.
   The Pentagon already has dispatched 25 reserve civil affairs
specialists along with 107 active duty experts to Panama.
   Civil affairs specialists act as liaison officers between the
military and the civilian government to help re-establish public
services disrupted by fighting, such as utilities and
transportation.
   Virtually all the Army's civil affairs specialists are in
reserve units, and the Pentagon paged those units for volunteers,
Fitts said.
   ``We've (in the reserves) been requested by the (regular)
Special Operations Command to augment the active duty civil affairs
officers in their effort to rebuild and restore order in Panama,''
he said.
   The Army particularly sought specialists, such as engineers or
people familiar with transit systems or sanitation programs.
   So many have volunteered, Fitts said in a telephone interview,
that he's been unable to get a count.
   The number to be chosen to go to Panama probably will be ``in
the dozens, rather than hundreds, because we really need people
with specific talents,'' he said.
   Most people can be expected to put in about two weeks, but
regulations permit a tour of duty of up to 139 days, a bit less
than 20 weeks.
   In Florida, soldiers from the 361st Civil Affairs Bridgade in
Pensacola and a subordinate unit, the 478th Civil Affairs Company
in Perrine, near Miami, will leave Friday for Panama, said Maj. Tom
Bechtell, a member of the brigade.
   Lt. Col. Richard Randall, plans and operations officer of the
brigade, said his unit will ``help the government with certain
expertise our individuals have in banking, utilities, medical
(matters), public transportation, law enforcement and education.''
   The 361st trains in Panama every year and routinely works with
the civil government and U.S. military there, Randall said.
   About 25 percent of the Pensacola-based reservists and half of
those in Perrine speak Spanish, he said.

   The Lorimar Studios changed the name
of its Robert Taylor Building after tenants complained in a
petition that the late actor testified before Congress against
Hollywood figures.
   The petitioners wanted Taylor's name banished because he
testified before the old House Un-American Activities Committee
against the so-called Hollywood 10, writers alleged to have
associated with communist organizations during the 1930s, '40s or
'50s.
   Taylor also was considered a supporter of the Hollywood
blacklist that kept those writers from working under their own
names.
   Arnold Shupack, senior vice president and general manager of
Lorimar, approved the name change on Nov. 15, his office said
Wednesday.
   Shupack changed the name of the building, containing mostly
offices of people connected to the industry, to the George Cukor
Building. Cukor directed most of his films on the movie lot that
Lorimar took over from MGM.
   Before MGM sold the lot, the 74-year-old building was called the
Lion Building. Lorimar changed the names of the lot's old buildings
to honor former movie stars.
   Taylor died of lung cancer in June 1969.

   The former president and later Communist Party
chief of Soviet Uzbekistan drew 12 years in prison Wednesday for
bribe-taking in a scandal that touched many officials in the
Central Asian republic, Tass said. The court also ordered an
investigation into the prosecution's action in arresting relatives
of the defendant, Inamzhon Usmankhodzhayev.
   The Uzbek was found guilty of accepting $82,100 in bribes
``discrediting state and party bodies, and severely damaging the
interests of the state and society,'' the Soviet news agency
reported. All his property was confiscated.
   He was party first secretary from 1983 to January 1988, when he
retired on a pension. Prior to that, he was president of Uzbekistan
for five years.
   Prosecutors Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov became instant
celebrities when they said their Uzbek corruption probe reached
into the ruling Politburo.
   But the two then were themselves accused of forcing confessions
and other improprities in their investigations. The public rallied
around the two prosecutors during the scandal.
   Both prosecutors are now members of parliament and no charges
have been filed against them.
   Tass described the scene outside the Moscow courtroom as
tumultous after the court's rulings Wednesday.
   ``Gdlyan and Ivanov should have sat on that (defendants') bench!
They held us in prison,'' cried Usmankhodzhayev's sister, Maryam,
according to Tass.
   Usmankhodzhayev tried to recant his confession, saying it was
made under duress, but the court rejected his claim.

   The Justice Department asked four European
nations Wednesday to freeze bank accounts where former Panamanian
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega is thought to have hidden illegal
drug profits.
   David Runkel, a department spokesman, said the legal papers were
filed with the governments of France, Switzerland, Luxembourg and
the United Kingdom, requesting authorities to order banks to block
any transactions in the Noriega accounts.
   ``The request is of money directly tied to his alleged illegal
drug trafficking,'' Runkel said, adding there is ``more than one
account in each country.''
   Authorities in France responded to the U.S. request by freezing
accounts in two banks holding $3.3 million under the names of
Noriega and members of his families. Swiss officials placed a
``precautionary'' freeze on two accounts in banks in Zurich and
Geneva.
   French investigators said the banks in France may have been used
as transit points for funds destined for Luxembourg or Switzerland.
   The Swiss Justice Ministry said the U.S. request charged Noriega
with giving ``logistic support'' to Colombian drug lords' shipments
to the United States.
   Noriega, who is hiding in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City, is
thought to have transferred at least $10 million into numerous
accounts in Europe, Runkel said. State Department officials,
however, say Noriega's personal wealth could total as much as $300
million.
   Deposed as dictator by U.S. troops on Dec. 20, Noriega has been
charged in Florida in two drug trafficking indictments.
   Runkel said department lawyers are confident they can document
that money Noriega sent abroad had been earned illegally in the
drug trade. U.S. troops seized a slew of records in Panama City
after Noriega was ousted.
   The four European countries are expected to cooperate with the
American request, rules of which are spelled out in international
treaties.
   ``We have had a remarkable display of international
cooperation,'' Runkel said. ``These letters were not sprung on
these countries this morning.''
   Once the bank accounts have been frozen _ as Justice expects _
there is still the possibility they will be barren, Runkel said.
It's conceivable, he said, that Noriega, his family or his bankers
moved money out of accounts since the invasion.
   Freezing assets is the first step to seizing them, said Runkel.
``These things are not easy processes.'' Any disposition of the
money, however, would be by international agreements.
   Preliminary discussions were also under way with others
countries where Noriega might has stashed money, Runkel said. But
he is not thought to have assets in the United States.
   State Department estimates put Noriega's worth at between $200
million to $300 million, much of it hidden in secret bank accounts
abroad.
   In a speech last August, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger alluded to multimillion-dollar transactions Noriega has
made over the past two years involving accounts in West Germany,
Switzerland and Luxembourg.
   The private gains Noriega has accumulated, Eagleburger said,
belie the image he has projected of a ``poor youth of humble
origins who by virtue of individual effort, merit and talent rose
through the ranks to become head of a small but respectable
military force.''

   The Arab League on Wednesday urged Romania's new
government to prevent attacks on Arabs following reports that Arab
mercenaries fought for its executed dictator. Britain cautioned
Romanian reformers to refrain from revenge attacks.
   Civic Forum, the Czechoslovak opposition group, said Wednesday
the Czechoslovak consulate in Bucharest had confirmed reports of
2,000 foreign mercenaries fighting with those loyal to executed
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``They were positive about Libyans and indicated Syrians and
Palestinians'' were involved, Civic Forum spokesman Michael
Zantovsky said in Prague after returning from Bucharest. He added
that the number of mercenaries could be even higher.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev spoke by telephone with
Ion Iliescu, the new interim president, who thanked his old college
chum for his support.
   For the first time, Israel criticized Ceausescu, who had been
highly regarded for his support of the Jewish state in the face of
East bloc opposition.
   Romania's former King Michael, who said he would be willing to
return, said the new government may collapse.
   Emergency aid poured into the country and relief agencies said
they needed money and blood rather than more food, clothing and
other supplies.
   The list of nations recognizing the new government grew longer.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar promised all
possible humanitarian asssistance to Romania and said he hoped the
transition to democracy would be peaceful.
   Some countries, including Czecholsovakia and Norway, the first
nation to recognize the new government, arranged for diplomats to
travel to Romania.
   The provisional government, called the National Salvation
Committee, took power after Ceausescu's ouster Friday, saying it
will hold power until elections can be held in April. Ceausescu and
his wife, Elena, were executed by a firing squad Monday, the
government said.
   President Bush said he was ``amazed'' at the changes that have
taken place in Romania. ``We did say we were concerned that the
trial of Ceausescu should have been more open, but that's their
matter,'' he said, adding that army seemed to be bringing the
remaining pro-Ceausescu forces under control.
   China's Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun on Wednesday
sent congratulations to Romania's new leaders and expressed hope
for continued friendship between the countries.
   Ceausescu's government had close ties with Beijing and Ceausescu
was one of the few world leaders to praise China's military
crackdown of the student democracy movement in June.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher praised ``the
extraordinary courage'' of the Romanian people in a warm message of
support to Iliescu.
   But Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said: ``There
mustn't be a bloodbath of revenge now.''
   Egypt, although expressing support for the new Romania
government, criticized the Ceausescus' execution without a public
trial.
   Officials from the 22-member Arab League met with the Romanian
ambassador in Tunis, Tunisia, to demand that Romanian officials
promise that Arabs living in Romania not be subjected to ``bad
treatment,'' a statement said.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization alleged Tuesday its
diplomatic staff and Palestinian students in Romania have been
attacked in recent days.
   Several Eastern European news agencies have accused
Palestinians, Libyans and Syrians of fighting alongside security
forces loyal to Ceausescu. Libya, Syria and the PLO have denied the
reports.
   In Jerusalem, a statement by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to
Parliament was the first time Israel openly criticized Ceausescu.
   Referring to the thousands of victims of the anti-Ceausescu
rebellion, Arens said, ``Israel condemns the terrible massacres
carried out by Ceausescu's security forces.''
   Ceausescu was the only East bloc leader to maintain ties with
Israel after the 1967 Middle East War, when the others sided with
the Arabs.
   Joining the United States and a score of states recognizing the
new Romanian leadership were Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and
North Korea, whose hard-line Communist government, led by Kim Il
Sung, was often compared to Ceausescu's.
   However, King Michael, who was deposed in 1947 when the
Communists took over and now lives in Switzerland, said he did not
expect the new government to last.
   ``The crowds do not accept what's there now, because they (the
government) have communist backgrounds. They have come from
Ceausescu's party, they worked with him before. So I don't think
the people will accept this,'' he said in a BBC television
interview broadcast Wednesday night.
   The king, who said he would return home immediately if he was
wanted, called the plan to hold elections in April ``a little
premature'' because Romania's political system had been destroyed
over the past 40 years.
   ``So there is actually no political groundwork to have elections
so soon,'' he said.
   Countries and charities sent or pledged millions of dollars,
food, tons of medical supplies and equipment and doctors and nurses
to help Romanians.
   Rony Brauman, president of the non-governmental aid agency
Doctors Without Borders which has 43 people working in 13 Romanian
cities, said in Paris the most pressing need is money.
   ``The urgent needs of Romania for drugs and medical and surgical
material are now covered,'' said Brauman. ``The problem now is
forwarding and distributing this aid as it's needed.''
   A Red Cross official told relief workers in Prague that blood is
the most urgent necessity.
   A committee has been set up in Bucharest under the auspices of
the Red Cross and the United Nations to coordinate assistance
arriving in Bucharest, the Red Cross said.
   In Washington, The American Red Cross urged people to send
money, not goods. It said 500 tons of food, clothing, blankets and
medical supplies have arrived or are en route.
   The Red Cross said it has received information that one
Hungarian Red Cross volunteer was fatally shot Friday while
bringing relief supplies to the western city of Timisoara.

<TEXT>
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
recently put to death 17 of its senior officers and imprisoned 29
others, a ministerial source was quoted by the Sudan News Agency as
saying Wednesday.
   The new report said no explanation was offered for the orders
purportedly given by rebel leader John Garang.
   The agency quoted the source as saying the rebels imprisoned 29
officers ranging from captain to lieutenant colonel ``while at the
same time demanding that the government release political detainees
and observe human rights.''
   The military government jailed ousted Prime Minister Sadek
el-Mahdi and about 50 other senior political leaders after the
military took power in a coup June 30. It says they will be tried
for political and economic corruption.
   The ministerial source said that of the rebels' five-man
military council, only Garang and William Noun remained. He
identified the other three only as Karbino, Silvar Care and Arok
Toun, and said all were in jail.
   No immediate comment came from the rebels.
   The Christian and animist rebel army took up arms against the
Moslem majority government in the north in 1983. The rebels demand
more autonomy and a greater share in the country's economic wealth.

   Dozens of store owners whose shops
were sacked by frenzied looting after the U.S. invasion were told
Wednesday that ``acts of war'' were not covered by their insurance
policies.
   ``We regret to inform you that the claim you have submitted ...
must be rejected because the insurance policy excludes losses
suffered as a direct or indirect result of acts of war,'' said one
letter Panamanian insurance companies were mailing Wednesday to
their clients.
   Conservative estimates by insurance brokers and store owners put
the damage and losses between $750 million and $1 billion,
according to Alfredo Maduro, president of the Panamanian Chamber of
Commerce.
   Maduro said Panamanian businessmen will now ask the United
States for direct assistance to try to recover losses and resume
operations.
   ``This is a bomb worse than the ones of last Wednesday. The
insurance companies are saying that in an invaded country there is
no insurance coverage,'' insurance broker Gilberto Jimenez said in
an interview.
   Businessmen have estimated that more than 90 percent of the
shops were looted on Via Espana and Central Avenue, two commercial
streets in downtown Panana City.
   Thousands of looters raided everything from food, furniture,
televisions and appliances. Only bookstores survived.
   Lazaro Gago, owner of the Gago supermarket chain, said six of
his nine establishments had been looted and added his company was
``in ruins.''
   Eight of nine of the Arrocha pharmacies also were looted.
   A car company said it lost $4 million to looters. Avis and other
rental companies still were looking for cars taken from their lots.
   Television stations ran ads from car distributors offering
rewards for information leading to the recovery of new vehicles.
   Looting damage in El Dorado, a shopping center for upper middle
neighborhoods, was estimated at $25 million.
   Maduro said the chamber would ask for direct U.S. assistance
``in the form of equipment, technology and interest-ree loans,
something like a Marshall Plan for Panama.''
   ``It is our responsibility to rebuild the economy,'' Maduro
said, ``but we do not have the capacity at this time.''
   Both Maduro and Jimenez regretted the damage was done mostly by
Panamanians.
   ``We have committed a grievous mistake,'' Maduro added. ``We
attacked our own business establishments while the Americans were
attacking military targets only.''

   Here is a brief summary of events Wednesday in Panama:
   _ Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega remained holed up in the Vatican
embassy in Panama City. A Vatican spokesman said he did not see how
Noriega could be turned over to the United States, which has no
extradition treaty with Panama.
   _ President Bush said negotiations to bring Noriega to trial
would continue. He appeared to leave open the possibility that
Noriega could be tried in Panama instead of the United States.
   _ U.S. soldiers set up powerful loudspeakers outside the Vatican
embassy, blaring music and radio news reports about negotiations
over Noriega's status.
   _ The U.S. Justice Department asked France, Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the United Kingdom to freeze bank accounts in which
Noriega is believed to have stashed more than $10 million in
``illegal drug money.'' France froze accounts in two banks holding
$3.3 million; Swiss officials placed a ``precautionary'' freeze on
two accounts.
   _ The Panama Canal, closed during the U.S. invasion, was
returning to normal gradually. Panama City residents returned to
work and lined up outside grocery stores.
   _ Panama's election commission certified that the U.S.-installed
president, Guillermo Endara, won the May 7 election that was
nullified by Noriega.

<HEAD>Archbishop Says Priest's Slaying May Have Been Politically Motivated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slaying of a French priest in
southeastern Brazil may have been politically motivated and not the
work of robbers, a Brazilian archbishop said Wednesday.
   The Rev. Gabriel Felix Roger Maire ``had been receiving death
threats for the past several months due to his work on behalf of
justice and human rights for the poor,'' Archbishop Silvestre
Scandian said by phone from Vitoria.
   Police found Maire, 53, shot in the chest and slumped over the
wheel of his car Saturday on the outskirts of Vitoria, 310 miles
northeast of Rio. Police arrested two suspects and charged them
with shooting Maire during an attempted robbery.
   Scandian disputed the police report, saying Maire's wristwatch
and other personal items were left in the car. A bag containing his
cassock and empty wallet was found about 100 yards from the scene.
   The Rev. Mauricio de Mattos Pereira, of the Archdiocese's
Justice and Peace Commission, said three other politically
motivated killings occurred in nearby towns since June.
   ``When you try to raise the consciousness of the small, the big
react,'' said Pereira. ``They want to silence all those trying to
show the poor the roots of injustice.''
   Maire arrived in Brazil in 1980 and worked in the lower-class
parish of Vila Velha, eight miles south of Vitoria.
   Thousands of people attended a wake for Maire on Tuesday. The
priest's body will be flown to France on Thursday, maccording to
Maria Beatrice de Seixas Correa, a spokeswoman at the French
consulate in Rio.
   The Roman Catholic Church here estimates more than 800 people
have been assassinated for political reasons since Brazil returned
to civilian rule after a right-wing military dictatorship ruled
from 1964 to 1985.
   Many of the victims have been rural union leaders involved in
land disputes and church activists who advise them.
   In only three cases, two involving the murder of priests, have
the killers been brought to justice, according to Amnesty
International, the human rights group.
   The most famous case involved the slaying of Chico Mendes, a
world-renowned union leader and environmentalist who led peaceful
protests to stop the clearing of Amazon rain forest by cattle
ranchers.
   Mendes, 44, was shot in his home in the backwoods Amazon town of
Xapuri on Dec. 22, 1988. Although a cattle rancher and his son have
been arrested and charged in the case, a judge last week announced
that the earliest possible trial date would be April 1990.

   Plumbers worked overtime across the South on Wednesday to repair
thousands of water pipes that burst when they froze in record low
temperatures, and frozen waterways are slowing shipping and
devastating some commercial fishing.
   Temperatures have eased since record lows late last week and
during the Christmas holiday weekend, with temperatures in the 40s
and 50s Wednesday in Georgia.
   Homeowners and plumbers in Houston were working as fast as they
could to repair thousands of pipes broken during three days of
record-setting lows.
   ``We're so busy I can't believe it,'' said Charles Rumsey,
general superintendent at Crown Plumbing. ``We're trying to hold
the men's working days down to 12 hours, but some of them are
getting 15 or 16 hours.''
   Houston officials said that by midday Wednesday, water pressure
in the city was up to 80 percent as leaks were gradually plugged.
   Residents of some Houston apartment complexes had been without
water since Friday. ``They're dipping water from the pool and
carrying it to their apartments to flush their toilets,'' said Jean
Williams, manager of Regency Arms apartments.
   In Jackson, Miss., Mayor Kane Ditto said it was impossible to
say when the city's water problems might be over.
   Ditto said crews working to restore service to the remainder of
60,000 homes and businesses that had been without water were still
finding new problems. He said there were 33 breaks in Jackson's 900
miles of water lines Wednesday morning, up from 10 the night before.
   Non-essential federal, state, county and city government workers
stayed off the job in Jackson.
   ``Our guys are working 'til they drop. I don't know how much
longer they can keep up this pace,'' said Bennie Payne, owner of
Central Plumb It Yourself Supply in Baton Rouge, La., which also
sends plumbers on house calls.
   The 50,000 residents of New Orleans' public housing projects
have had little or no water. City officials said water pressure
dropped from a normal 65 pounds per square inch to about 47 because
of pipe breaks.
   The Louisiana freeze, called the harshest of this century by
meteorologists, sent temperatures below 32 degrees for almost 82
hours in New Orleans and below 15 degrees for 15 hours.
   While water pressure plunged, the economic pressures of the
freeze pushed produce prices higher at the wholesale level. Prices
were expected to climb soon in supermarkets as well, experts said
Wednesday.
   ``The pipeline stays filled for three to seven days in advance
of any major prices change in the marketplace,'' said Reggie Brown,
spokesman for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association in
Orlando. ``You'll start seeing it showing up probably within a
week.''
   Heating oil prices continued to climb as well. In New Hampshire,
the cost per gallon of home heating oil hit a record high $1.37, up
from 81 cents on Oct. 5, Jonathan Osgood, director of the
Governor's Energy Office, said Wednesday. The previous high was
$1.29 in March 1981.
   The freeze ravaged the citrus industry in Louisiana's
Plaquemines Parish for the second time since 1983. Unlike growers
in Florida and Texas, Louisiana orchard owners got most of the
fruit picked before the freeze, but the trees were damaged.
   ``It's a disaster second only to a big hurricane,'' said Luke A.
Petrovich, president of the Plaquemines Parish Council. ``We've
lost our entire citrus industry, all our truck farms are wiped out,
and the fishing industry will be hit real hard.''
   ``Not only are there thousands of frozen fish in the marshes,
but we also have oysters frozen in their shells. The seafood has
been totally spoiled, ruined,'' said Joe Buras, president of the
Delta Commercial Fishermen's Association of Plaquemines Parish.
   In the East, this is turning out to be the iciest winter on
Chesapeake Bay, with foot-thick ice in places, since the winter of
1976-77 when much of the estuary froze.
   The Coast Guard has been hampered in its efforts to clear
shipping lanes because of the four ships it used for ice-breaking
are in for repairs, said Lt. Cmdr. Steven Waldmann.
   Farther north, up to a half-foot of ice on Pittsburgh's three
rivers has brought barge and boat traffic to a virtual standstill.
Ice covers 70 percent to 100 percent of the Allegheny, Monongahela
and Ohio rivers.
   ``The river people I talk to are saying this is the worst
they've seen since the winter of 1977-78,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr.
Anthony Regalbuto.

   The Rev. Cecil Franklin, singer Aretha Franklin's
brother and personal manager, has died of a heart attack. He was 49.
   Franklin, who died at his home Tuesday, had been suffering from
pneumonia for two months, said his wife, Earline. He was assistant
pastor of New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit.
   ``Cecil was Aretha's biggest fan,'' his wife said. ``Aretha and
Cecil are very close _ they are more than sister and brother. Cecil
really enjoyed hearing Aretha on stage.''
   Born in 1940 in Memphis, Tenn., he became an aide to his father
about 20 years ago at the church the Rev. C.L. Franklin Sr. founded
in 1946.
   The elder Franklin, a civil rights activist, died in 1984 after
spending five years in a coma from a beating by burglars at his
home.
   In addition to his wife and sister, he is survived by a
daughter, Cristal; a stepson, Luren Bowie; sisters Carella and
Erma; a brother, Vaughn and a granddaughter.

   President Bush assured the folks back
home Wednesday that his wife is ``in very good health,''
notwithstanding what the they may have read in a supermarket
tabloid.
   Bush, addressing more than 800 people at a barbeque dinner in
his home state, said he left Mrs. Bush back at the White House
``winding down her responsibilities as a grandparent'' over the
Christmas holidays.
   ``She is in good health. I get asked that all the time,'' said
Bush about his wife of 44 years who has been undergoing treatment
for Graves disease.
   Graves disease is the result of an overactive thyroid gland and
has caused teary eyes and double vision in Mrs. Bush, according to
her doctors.
   The National Enquirer recently ran an article claiming her
condition was worse than the White House has let on and that the
first lady was in severe pain at times.
   The White House says Mrs. Bush is responding to treatment. She
visited the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., last month, where
specialists decided to vary her medication, prednisone.
   ``You know, there is a magazine that I'm sure nobody here is too
familiar with called the National Enquirer. But apparently they
printed a story about her on their front page and we've had more
crazy letters and inquiries'' about her health, said the president.
   ``She's in very good health. She feels just great,'' said Bush.
   Barbara Bush will join her husband on Friday in Houston, where
they will ring in the new year. They also plan to visit soldiers
wounded in Panama at two military hospitals in San Antonio on
Sunday.
   Bush is spending three days in South Texas without his wife,
hunting for quail at the ranch of a friend, Will Farish, as he has
during Christmas week for years.
   The crowd gave a vigorous round of applause when Bush concluded
his remarks on his wife's health by saying, ``I think Bar's doing a
fantastic job for our country.'
   The Bushes celebrated Christmas with their five children and 11
grandchildren at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.

   Egypt and Syria agreed to restore
diplomatic relations Wednesday after a 12-year rift caused by the
late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's peace negotiations with
Israel.
   A summit between presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt will take place in early January, the prime
ministers of both countries announced. Syrian Prime Minister
Mahmoud Zoubi said restoring ties ``will open a new page in the
history of our common destiny.''
   The accord was announced at the end of a one-day visit to
Damascus by Prime Minister Atef Sedki of Egypt. At a news
conference, Sedki and Zoubi said they agreed to exchange
ambassadors. They gave no date for the January summit.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials said the development could
improve Israel's peace prospects with the Arab world. Egypt is the
only Arab nation with which Israel has a peace treaty, and Syria
has been an implacable foe.
   A statement released in Cairo and Damascus said: ``The
governments of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Arab Republic of
Egypt have agreed to resume full diplomatic relations, effective
Wednesday, Dec. 27, 1989. This comes to express the determination
of the two peoples to consolidate brotherly relations in all
fields.''
   The announcement said changes worldwide made both countries
realize the ``necessity of achieving comprehensive Arab entente as
a sound basis for joint Arab action.''
   Syria and Egypt were united in 1958 under a pan-Arabic movement
led by Sadat's predecessor, Gamal Abdul Nasser. They resumed
independent governments in 1961.
   Assad broke ties after Sadat made a dramatic visit to Jerusalem
in 1977, the opening move in two years of negotiations that
resulted in the Egypt-Israel peace accord.
   Avi Pazner, aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
characterized Wednesday's agreement as ``part of Egypt's going back
to the Arab world'' after its ostracism.
   ``We hope it will bring about a bigger realization in the Arab
world that peace with Israel is possible and desirable,'' he told
The Associated Press.
   However, Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said Israel did not see
the agreement as ``signifying any change in the Syrian position
regarding Israel or peace.''
   Sedki, the first such high-ranking Egyptian official to visit
the Syrian capital since the rift, met for two hours with Assad
before the announcement. He said the results of the meeting were
``even more than I originally expected.
   ``President Assad talked very warmly about Egypt and recalled
all the past and historic ties between the two countries. He
further qualified the period of complications as an experience we
should profit from.''
   Damascus radio said Sedki carried a message to Assad from
Mubarak. He did not disclose its contents.
   ``The purpose of this trip is to take the last step, following
which comes the resumption of ties,'' Sedki said. ``Egypt's goal is
to unify ranks with Syria and consolidate cooperation between our
two countries.''
   In a brief statement to reporters, Zoubi said developments
``witnessed by the Arab world require that Syria and Egypt return
to each other on the basis of their historical and fraternal
bonds.''
   Mubarak said Tuesday that he and Assad planned to meet, but
indicated this would follow restoration of diplomatic links.
   Mubarak said his policy was never to allow improvement of
Egypt's relations with any country to affect ties with another
nation.
   This appeared aimed at both Syria and Iraq, ruled by rival wings
of the Arab Baath Party and at odds for years.
   Egypt aided Iraq militarily in its eight-year war with Iran.
Syria backed Iran.
   Seventeen Arab states severed relations with Egypt after the
Camp David peace accords with Israel in 1979. All except Libya now
have restored diplomatic ties with Egypt.

   Three Romanian Olympic and world
shooting experts performed ``genuine acts of heroism '' by
annihilating a group of ``terrorists'' in Bucharest, the Romanian
news agency Agerpres said Wednesday.
   The agency, monitored in Vienna, said Ion Corneliu, Sorin Babii
and Gratian Calota ``fought at Ghencea Military Cemetery where they
annihilated a group of terrorists that furiously attacked an
important military target in the area.''
   The report did not say who the terrorists were, but they were
presumably loyal to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   It did not give a specific date for that encounter nor for
others in which it said athletes paid a part.
   Agerpres said wrestlers Catalin Rosca and Ionel Baciu were
helping the militia at the Chitial checkpoint at the entrance to
the capital.

   President Bush said Wednesday he is
determined to bring to justice Manuel Antonio Noriega ``for
poisoning the children of the United States'' with drugs, but he
conceded that the Vatican's refusal to give up thedeposed
Panamanian dictator does ``complicate things.''
   In a speech before a crowd of more than 800 at a barbeque dinner
in Beeville, near one of his favorite South Texcas hunting haunts,
Bush drew loud applause both when he promised to press to bring
Noriega to trial and to avoid ``hellacious cuts'' in the defense
budget.
   ``I am determined to bring him to justice. We have to work with
our friends in the Vatican. We have to certainly work with respect
with the new Endara government in Panama,'' he said. ``But I want
to see this man who is under indictment brought to justice for
poisoning the children of the United States of America'' with drugs.
   A senior official who spoke on condition that he not be
identified said in Washington that officials believe the Vatican
has not yet defined its position, and thus a resolution is not
close.
   But this official said the administration expects a solution
sooner rather than later because it is in no one's interest _ not
that of the United States, Panama or the Vatican _ to allow the
current state of affairs to drag on.
   Earlier, at a news conference upon landing in Corpus Christi,
Bush said he was putting ``no time limit'' on the quest to bring
Noriega, now holed up in the Vatican's embassy in Panama City, to
trial in the United States. Noriega was indicted in Florida on
federal drug trafficking charges in 1988.
   In his dinner remarks, Bush called the U.S. military operation
in Panama ``a superb effort'' and said it makes him determined to
resist calls for deep cuts in defense spending.
   ``I believe we should keep a ready force that is able to defend
American interests and American lives around the world,'' he said
from a stage surrounded by bales of hay.
   A banner read: ``Bee County is Bush Quail Country.''
   ``We're still going down the road of trying to get him sent
here,'' said Bush, starting a five-day hunting and fishing trip in
his adopted homestate of Texas. ``We will continue to negotiate.''
   He refused to criticize the Holy See, telling reporters ``we're
not posturing ourselves as trying to be calling people to task''
and saying it was no time for ``name-calling.''
   Bush appeared to leave open the possibility that Noriega could
be tried in Panama. He said there was a threat of Noriega regaining
power if he remained there ``unless he were in total custody and
sentenced to the prison sentence he deserves.''
   Answering questions at Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, where
he took pilot training in 1943, Bush exclaimed: ``Noriega turning
himself in was about as good a Christmas present as our soldiers,
Marines, airmen and the American people could want.'' He pronounced
the U.S. military intervention ``an amazingly well-coordinated,
superbly executed operation.''
   The president said he wasn't worried about taking a vacation
while U.S. troops remained active in Panama. ``Why should I be? ''
he asked. ``It's winding down.''
   Bush commenced his vacation as a Vatican spokesman, Joaquin
Navarro, said there was no legal way its embassy in Panama City
could hand over Noriega. In Washington, the Justice Department made
good on its Tuesday threat to seek a freeze on European bank
accounts where Noriega is believed to have stashed millions of
dollars in illegal drug profits.
   The president maintained Wednesday he had no concerns about
Noriega revealing U.S.-Panamanian intelligence secrets at a trial.
   He was referring to things Noriega might reveal about his
previous close relations with the U.S. government, including the
period in the 1970s when Bush was CIA director and Noriega was an
intelligence source.
   ``I think that's history, and I think the main thing is he
should be tried and brought to justice,'' Bush said at a brief news
conference.
   A U.S. trial could result in ``some release of certain
confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole
justice process.'' But, he added, ``The system works, so I wouldn't
worry about that.''
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
aboard Air Force One that Noriega ``can talk about the CIA and Bush
until he's blue in the face. It won't hurt anything.''
   Bush, asked whether the United States would let Panama try
Noriega, replied: ``That would require a lot of conversations
because we don't want to do anything that even implies undermining
the sovereign power of Panama or the fact the government is
operating with the trust of the people.''
   The president said he was personally involved in efforts to gain
custody of Noriega from the Vatican embassy in Panama, where
Noriega has been sheltered since Christmas Eve, but he had not
contacted either the papal nuncio in Panama City or Pope John Paul
II. Bush did say he planned to hold talks with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, his longtime friend and hunting partner, while
in Texas.
   Asked about U.S. demands that the embassy directly turn over
Noriega to U.S. authorities, the Vatican City spokesman said there
was no legal way that could be done. He said the embassy is
empowered to deal only with the government of Panama and no other
foreign government.
   On a related matter, Bush said it will take ``a lot of
diplomatic effort and a lot of it on my part'' to repair relations
with Latin countries offended by the U.S. invasion of Panama. He
said he thinks that once they see the democratically elected
government in place, and they see that Noriega is ``out of the
picture _ none of them supported him at all; they found him
outrageous _ then I think you begin to see the problem that might
have been caused by a prolonged conflict down there.''
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department Wednesday asked authorities in
Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Britain to halt transactions in
bank accounts believed to hold $10 million Noriega amassed through
drug dealing.
   France and Switzerland responded by freezing accounts in four
banks.
   In another development, Panama's new government sent a
high-level economic team to Washington for talks with officials
from the State and Treasury departments and other agencies about
reviving that country's economy, blasted by months of U.S.
sanctions against the Noriega regime.
   The assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, Bernard
Aronson, said a U.S. delegation will be sent to Panama soon to
continue the talks.
   Meanwhile, Bush had some success in his fishing and hunting
expedition Wednesday. The president, who was plagued by bad luck
fishing at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, last summer, caught
three fish off San Jose Island and showed off a huge, 22-inch
redfish to reporters to prove his claim.
   ``I wanted you to know we weren't lying,'' Bush told reporters
in Beeville. His fishing companion, Baker, showed off part of his
catch, a large trout. Baker caught four or five fish to Bush's
three.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and Baker also
bagged 10 quail between them in a morning shoot.

   Typhoon Jack weakened rapidly Thursday to
tropical depression status and no longer posed a threat to this
U.S. territory or any other islands in the western Pacific, weather
officials said.
   Jack's sustained winds, which had been clocked as high as 135

Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   In eight hours on Thursday, Jack went from typhoon status, with
winds of at least 74 mph, to a tropical storm, with winds from 39

the center said.
   At last report, Jack was 220 miles southeast of Guam and slowly
drifting south and unlikely to re-form into a threatening storm,
forecasters said.

   A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the
unpressurized rear stairway of an Eastern Airlines jet that arrived
here Wednesday from Barbados, police said.
   An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of death of the
Barbadian youth, whose identity was being withheld pending
notification of his family, said Metro-Dade police spokesman Bill
Kinnebrew.
   Flight 928 arrived at Miami International Airport just before
noon from the eastern Caribbean island, and passengers exited
normally through the airport rampway, Kinnebrew said.
   ``Everybody got off the airplane, and when the ground crew
opened the back stairwell, they found the body,'' he said.
   The rear stair of the Boeing 727 stretch is used on smaller
runways without terminal ramps and by ground crews, and is not
pressurized or heated during flight, Kinnebrew said.
   The plane cruised at 35,000 feet on the 1,000-mile direct
flight, said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   ``Death could could have been either freezing or suffocation,''
she said. ``At that altitude there is very little oxygen, and it
would have been well below zero degrees.''
   She said the stowaway may have entered the plane in the Barbados
during servicing, but Eastern did not yet know if he had any
connection with the airport there.

   Doctors kept a close watch Wednesday on the
nation's second living-donor liver transplant recipient, who was
recuperating from follow-up surgery to reduce an infection.
   Sarina Jones, 16 months, remained in critical but stable
condition, according to Susan Phillips, a spokeswoman for the
University of Chicago Hospitals.
   ``She's experiencing some bleeding problems,'' said Ms.
Phillips, explaining that such complications are common in all
liver transplant cases.
   Sarina received part of a liver Dec. 8 from her father, Robert
Jones, a dry-wall installer from Millington, Tenn.
   Alyssa Smith, who was the nation's first living-donor liver
transplant recipient, remained in serious condition Wednesday. Her
condition was upgraded from critical but stable on Tuesday.
   Teresa Smith, 29, an elementary school teacher who donated part
of her liver to her daughter for the Nov. 27 transplant, was
released from the hospital two weeks ago. The Smiths are from
Schertz, Texas.
   Sarina underwent another operation Tuesday to remove a small
abscess from her abdomen, Ms. Phillips said.
   Sarina and Alyssa suffered from biliary atresia, a usually fatal
congenital defect which is the leading reason for liver transplants
in children.

<TEXT>
   U.S. soldiers on Wednesday blasted
rock music and the latest Panama news bulletins at the Vatican
embassy where Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is shuttered, as the
stalemate over his fate continued.
   Both the United States and the new U.S-backed Panamanian
government renewed their pleas Wednesday to the Vatican to release
the ousted dictator.
   ``We feel that the nunciature, the papal nuncio should in the
very near future ask the ex-dictator to leave,'' said President
Guillermo Endara. ``We believe that Gen. Noriega's crimes are not
political. He is a common criminal of the worst kind.''
   In Texas, President Bush said Wednesday he is determined to
bring Noriega to justice ``for poisoning the children of the United
States'' with drugs, but Bush conceded the Vatican's refusal to
give him up does ``complicate things.''
   The diplomatic standoff went into its fourth day and Noriega's
fate remained undetermined. A Vatican spokesman said he did not see
how Noriega could be released to the United States. Among
alternatives being discussed were transfer to a third country and a
trial for Noriega in Panama.
   ``He has been accused, justly accused, of homicides and
narcotrafficking and very, very horrendous crimes,'' Endara said at
a news conference.
   Also on Wednesday, the Panama Canal was returning to normal
gradually, and a spokeswoman said waterway officials hoped to go to
24-hour operation to clear a 125-ship backup as more personnel
returned to work.
   In Panama City, battered by days of fighting and looting, people
were returning to work and lined up outside grocery stores that
were not looted.
   The president of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce, Alfredo
Maduro, put losses caused by looting between $750 million and $1
billion.
   At some gasoline stations, motorists were lowering buckets into
below-ground storage tanks to fill up their cars. The pumps were
destroyed at many stations by looters.
   In Colon, 50 miles northwest of Panama City, U.S. soldiers
confiscated a warehouse belonging to Carlos Duque, Noriega's
candidate for president in the annulled May elections. A U.S.
soldier who helped in the search said the drug-sniffing dog ``was
running around in circles'' but the troops wouldn't say if drugs
were found.
   On Wednesday, some of the 100 U.S. troops surrounding the
Vatican Embassy hooked up powerful loudspeakers in a nearby parking
lot and played rock songs that included ``I Fought the Law,''
``Voodoo Child'' and ``You're No Good.'' The music could be heard
by reporters on the 12th floor of a nearby hotel.
   Throughout the afternoon, the olive-green loudspeakers were
hooked up to U.S. Southern Command radio. If Noriega was listening,
he could have heard about negotiations over his status and that the
United States froze millions of dollars he allegedly stashed in
overseas accounts.
   A technician who got out of a U.S. military communications van
opened a telephone line box outside the walls of the embassy, but
it couldn't be determined if the lines were being fixed or tapped.
   The Americans also shot out all street lights with pellet guns
and mowed tall grass outside the embassy compound. A Southern
Command spokesman refused to say whether the actions might be for
security or for harassment.
   Noriega fled to the embassy on Sunday, five days after a U.S.
invasion toppled his government and sent him into hiding. U.S.
troops, armored cars and helicopters ring the embassy around the
clock to ensure the toppled strongman doesn't escape or get
spirited away.
   The United States wants to capture Noriega and bring him to the
United States to face drug trafficking charges filed in 1988.
   In Rome, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro reiterated Wednesday
there is no legal way the Holy See can hand Noriega over as there
is no extradition treaty with the United States.
   Navarro added the Vatican is studying the case in its
``juridical, diplomatic and humanitarian, and therefore, ethical
considerations.''
   Without an agreement, it would be nearly impossible for Noriega
to get past the U.S. troops surrounding the Vatican mission. At the
same time, U.S. troops cannot go after Noriega because embassies
are inviolable under international law.
   Faced with the possibility Noriega could be granted asylum in
another country, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers Wednesday
in four countries to freeze bank accounts in which Noriega is
believed to have stashed more than $10 million in ``illegal drug
money.''
   Cuba and the Dominican Republic, where one of Noriega's
daughters lives, have been mentioned as possible havens.
   However, Dominican Foreign Minister Joaquin Ricardo said
Wednesday his country has an extradition treaty with the United
States and Noriega could be extradited if he goes there.
   Bush appeared to leave open the possibility that Noriega could
be tried in Panama. He said there was a threat of Noriega regaining
power if he remained ``unless he were ... sentenced to the prison
sentence he deserves.''
   Endara said Panama's constitution forbids extradition of
Panamaniam nationals to another country but said a loophole might
be provided by the 1904 treaty that allowed the United States to
build the Panama Canal.
   Also Wednesday, Panama's election commission certified that
Endara won a May 7 election nullified by Noriega. The commission
said tallies collected by Endara's coalition were enough to show
his ticket winning with 62.5 percent of the vote. Endara was sworn
in on Dec. 20, shortly after the U.S. invasion began.
   The U.S. military said it arrested most members of Noriega's
Defense Forces, which numbered 15,000, and only a few hundred
remained unaccounted for.
   Among those reported arrested Wednesday was Vicky Amado,
Noriega's long-time mistress.
   Southern Command said Wednesday 23 Americans were killed and 322
wounded since the United States invaded. It said 297 Panamanians
were killed and 123 wounded. Doctors say more than 100 civilians
also died during the fighting.
   Meanwhile, Panama's ambassador to Mexico, Jorge Turner Morales,
resigned and asked for asylum in Mexico, a Panamanian Embassy
employee said on condition of anonymity. Mexico has not officially
recognized the Endara government.
   ``I cannot accept a government that was imposed under the
machine guns of George Bush,'' Turner Morales was quoted as saying
by Mexico's Excelsior news service.

   Four soldiers and a sailor were buried with full military honors
and 21-gun salutes Wednesday, one week after they were killed in
the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   The funerals, held in West Virginia, South Carolina,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Alabama, drew scores of military
personnel from each branch as well as high-ranking elected
officials and clergymen. Altogether, 23 American troops died in the
fighting last week.
   In Princeton, W.Va., Army Pvt. 2 Kenneth Douglas Scott, 20, was
buried in the snowy mountains he called home as about 100 mourners
looked on, including his foster parents and the woman he had
planned to marry next month.
   ``I believe when he joined the military, he wanted to believe in
something. I want to remember him as a soldier, steadfast and
unmovable, who died for what he believed in,'' said the Rev. Dwight
Palmer, pastor of St. Paul's Holy United Church of Woodlawn, Va.
Palmer is the son of Scott's guardian, Ruth Palmer.
   A military honor guard from Fort Knox, Ky., saluted Scott's
casket one by one at a Princeton funeral home. The guard fired a
21-gun salute, traditionally reserved for special burials, at
Roselawn Memorial Gardens cemetery a few blocks from the funeral
home.
   Scott, who joined the Army in June and was stationed at Fort
Polk, La., died serving with the 6th Infantry Division in early
fighting in Panama City on Dec. 20, according to the Defense
Department.
   In Central Falls, R.I., some 300 mourners filled Notre Dame
Church for the funeral of Army Cpl. Ivan Perez, a native of
Colombia who grew up in Rhode Island.
   The 22-year-old Perez was killed in an ambush by forces loyal to
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Army said. The Rev. Dennis Reardon
told mourners that his death ``shatters the superficial beauty of
Christmastime.''
   ``This isn't the Christmas that any one of us planned,'' Reardon
said. ``We are grateful to him for the sacrifice he made. We value
and appreciate all the honors and awards being given to him today.''
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete and U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell were among
those at the ceremony.
   Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said
he was ``here to honor someone who has fallen in the line of duty
for his country, and to comfort his family.''
   At St. Agnes Parish church in Arlington, Mass., about 550
family, friends and sympathizers, including Roman Catholic Cardinal
Bernard Law, mourned Navy Lt. j.g. John Connors.
   Connors, a 25-year-old Arlington native, had volunteered for
service in Panama. He had joined the Navy in 1987 and served in the
special operations unit known as the SEALS, or Sea, Air and Land
teams. The Pentagon did not release the circumstances of his death.
   ``We celebrate a common loss and recognize a common grief,''
said the Rev. John McIntyre, one of Connors' teachers at Boston
College High School. ``We do not come here this morning to find
anything like sense, because there is no sense.''
   Law picked up on the theme of the search for meaning in Connors'
death.
   ``It is a senselessness,'' Law said. ``The senselessness of sin,
and sin works itself out in Romania and elsewhere.''
   Among the mourners was the new Panamanian ambassador to the
United Nations, Eduardo Vallerino, who lives in the neighboring
town of Belmont.
   In Seneca, S.C., more than 300 people attended the funeral of
Army Specialist Phillip S. Lear, one of three South Carolina
natives killed during the invasion.
   The infantryman died Dec. 20 of gunshot wounds while American
troops were mopping up an area near Rhiohato Air Force Base, about
65 miles west of Panama City.
   The service at the United Assembly of God Church for the
21-year-old Westminster native was attended by scores of military
personnel from each branch of the service. Lear was buried at the
Oconee Memorial Park and, like the others, given a 21-gun salute.
   Maj. Gen. John A. Renner handed an American flag to Lear's
mother after the burial and thanked her ``on behalf of the
president of the United States and a very greatful nation ... for
the selfless and honorable service of your son.''
   At Fort Mitchell National Cemetary in Alabama, two military
brothers buried a third brother, Army Sgt. Michael DeBlois, at a
ceremony attended by about 40 friends and relatives.
   DeBlois, 24, of Columbus, Ga., was eulogized as a good soldier
who turned in an honorable performance in Panama, despite an
earlier flesh wound he received when hit by debris from an
exploding building.
   The radio operator was one of two soldiers killed when someone
tossed a grenade inside a building in Panama City that had been
``cleared'' by U.S. troops, according to DeBlois' squad leader.

   Romania's national library is
desperate for books, but not that desperate. The complete works of
Nicolae Ceausescu are headed for the pulping machine.
   ``Perhaps we'll keep one copy of each, somewhere,'' allowed
Angela Popescu Bradiceni, director since 1955, with a slight sniff.
``After all, we are a library.''
   A trigger of the revolution was the looming presence of the
dictator's numbing words, bound in bulk. They were stacked in the
window of every bookstore. At the national library, they filled six
long rows.
   Enthusiastic workmen have already carted off various
translations of ``On the Way of Building up the Multilaterally
Developed Socialist Society,'' all 32 volumes, 700 pages each. The
English edition was baled to go.
   Had anyone ever checked out volume 26, for example, he would
have learned: ``The visit I have paid to Somalia at the invitation
of President Mohamed Siad Barre has yielded highly good results.''
   The pile included leaflets of speeches, collected mental musings
and 12-ounce publicity packets to the glory of a man who traveled
the world ceaselessly to exchange fulsome toasts and pose for
photos.
   One collection had almost identical covers. At the left, there
was Ceausescu with slicked down jet black hair and a debonaire
mien, a photo from 1957. At the right, there was someone else:
Jimmy Carter, Brezhnev, Mengistu, or whichever of his friends he
happened to be visiting.
   But not all the purged books were his.
   There was also ``Research in the Field of Systems and
Characteristics of Macromolecules'' by his wife, Elena.
   ``No one ever read this stuff, no one,'' said Virgil Tiberiu
Spanu, director of acquisitions. ``Never.''
   The couple was ousted from power Friday. They were reported
executed Monday A new revolutionary council has promised free
elections and democracy.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the Romanian Mission tossed
out dozens of books by Ceausescu, cut the hammer and sickle from
its flag, and dropped ``socialist'' from its name.
   Delegation member Dino Marian said Wednesday, ``I must confess
there already was a thick layer of dust on the books.''
   For the librarians, destroying Ceausescu's books was sweet
revenge for bibliophiles forced to hide away 10 percent of their
collection under lock and key.
   Ceausescu's strict laws forbade anyone without a special permit
to see books about Romanian politics since World War I, or works of
anyone suspected to be even a mild dissident. Books by foreign
radicals or U.S. economists also were restricted.
   Romanian and foreign researchers had to apply to a cultural
council that decided whether to grant permission. Applications were
referred to the secret police.
   ``When you applied to the council, a very secret, complex
mechanism came into play,'' Spanu said. ``Most people did not
bother.'' Some books were banned altogether.
   Mostly, books were not bought because the library had no foreign
currency.
   ``We were 10 to 15 years behind the world in scientific
material,'' Spanu said. The library's latest edition of the journal
``Chemical Abstracts'' is from 1972.
   But the problem went beyond money.
   In Romania, each typewriter had to be registered with the
police, along with a sample of its characters.
   At the news agency Agerpres, editors made a careful selection of
what was truth for the general public, what would be passed along
in a single copy and what would go nowhere at all.
   At the national library, directors are confident of a sharp
shift. As one good omen, their collection survived the revolution.
   Although the nearby university library lost 500,000 books,
burned in fighting between Ceausescu loyalists and revolutionaries,
all of the national library's 1.5 million volumes survived.
   ``We were lucky because we have no building of our own, and our
books are in storage all over town,'' Mrs. Bradiceni said.
   She looked around at at the shelves purged of Ceausescu's works.
``Now we have plenty of room.''

<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said Wednesday
all those supporting U.S. military intervention in Central America
will be ``neutralized, cut off and executed'' if the United States
attacks Nicaragua.
   The threat by the ruling leftist Sandinista government was not
specific, but appeared aimed at the 14-party National Opposition
Union coalition and its presidential candidate, Violeta Chamorro,
in national elections Feb. 25.
   The warning came in a special communique to all military units
broadcast over government radio and part of a maximum alert of
armed forces ordered Dec. 20 by President Daniel Ortega, hours
after the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   It said that at the start of any ``Yankee intervention,'' all
units are ordered ``to apply plans to neutralize, cut off and
execute all recalcitrant traitors who openly or covertly have been
encouraging such Yankee intervention.''
   Earlier Wednesday, the Sandinista newspaper Barricada said
Nicaragua will not let a U.S. plane carrying monthly supplies for
the U.S. Embassy land as scheduled on Jan. 11.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto told U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker III Tuesday night the measure was taken because U.S.
forces would not let Nicaraguan planes land in Panama and
surrounded the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama City, Barricada said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Lou Falino said he had no comment.
   Last week, Nicaraguan troops surrounded the U.S. Embassy in
Managua in response to Nicaragua's embassy in Panama being
surrounded. U.S. officials were trying to prevent any effort by
ousted Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to flee to
that embassy.
   Instead, he took refuge in the Vatican embassy.

   Two gunmen robbed a jewelry district
wholesaler of nearly $1 million in gold Wednesday after handcuffing
and tying up its two owners and five employees, police said.
   The robbers carried pistols and manhandled their captives, but
the victims were not harmed. The gunmen, wearing surgical gloves,
took the gold from an open safe, put it into a briefcase and made
their getaway, the victims said.
   Khatchik Djigardjian, a co-owner of Rope Mine Corp. with his
brother Liouduig, described the robbers as a tall, Irish-looking
man who was silent and a short, bald man who spoke with an
undetermined accent.
   The loot included at least 103 pounds of fine gold, gold chains,
locks and scrap bars, Djigardjian said. An inventory would
determine the exact loss, but it was ``close to a million dollars
if not more than that,'' Djigardjian said.
   Gold closed at $406 per troy ounce in Zurich and $408.49 in Hong
Kong on Wednesday.
   Police believe about 115 pounds of gold were taken, said
Detective Manny Garcia. The detectives' report said both robbers
may have been Middle Eastern.
   A Russian Armenian who emigrated to Lebanon and then came to the
United States in 1974, Djigardjian said he has run a gold business
in the building since 1976.

<HEAD>Documents: Mobil Attorneys Wanted to Shield Execs from Pollution
Consequences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Mobil Oil Corp. wanted to
shield top executives from details of environmental problems at
chemical plants to protect them from legal action, according to
court papers filed in a lawsuit against the oil giant.
   The papers were filed in federal court here in a lawsuit against
the nation's second largest oil company by Valcar Bowman Jr. of
Riverdale, Ga., Mobil Chemical Co.'s former environmental affairs
manager.
   Bowman claims he was fired in April 1986 because he refused to
go along with a cover-up of pollution problems. Bowman had been the
division's second ranking environmental official.
   The court papers also quote a memorandum by a company lawyer as
saying attorney-client privilege can be used to keep documents out
of the hands of government agencies.
   The papers shed new light on wording changes sought by Mobil
lawyers in confidential reports about environmental conditions at
plants nationwide.
   Those reports, filed with the court, remain sealed. U.S.
District Judge Harold A. Ackerman unsealed them Friday but delayed
his order when Mobil said it would appeal.
   The company denies covering up pollution problems, argues that
the changes were minor and and contends that Bowman was fired in an
economic cutback.
   Ackerman ruled Dec. 11 that enough evidence existed for the case
to go to trial, denying Mobil's summary judgment motion. Briefs
submitted by both sides for the motion were released this week and
contain the disclosures.
   Mobil Chemical Co.'s then-environmental counsel, Winfred T.
Colbert, ``voiced concern'' in a 1985 memorandum about the
company's ``longstanding practice'' of distributing the
environmental reports to upper-level management, according to a
brief by Bowman's lawyer, Stephen B. Wiley.
   The memo concerns a report about the company's Jacksonville,
Ill., plant.
   ``I note that the report contains several admissions of
non-compliance, which in some cases are unavoidable,'' the memo
read. ``The principal concern I have in this regard relates to the
potential liability which can attach to all managers who receive
the report.''
   Colbert said only plant managers, Mobil environmental officials
and lawyers should see whole reports. Others would receive
summaries on a ``need-to-know basis.''
   ``This revised procedure will properly focus direct
responsibility for necessary actions at the plant level and
minimize the potential exposure of higher level management,'' the
brief quoted Colbert as writing.
   ``What Colbert said there, I think, is general lawyering,'' said
Mobil spokesman Allen Gray in New York, denying it was company
policy.
   Mobil Chemical Co.'s president, Art E. Biggs, wrote a letter at
about the same time that required line managers to report
``significant'' environmental problems to him, said the division's
general counsel, Ron Neill.
   Colbert ``wasn't trying to shield anybody from liability,''
Neill said, but was only making sure that responsibility for plant
operations was properly delegated.
   Bowman also charges that Mobil removed records from its
Bakersfield, Calif., plant, which was under scrutiny by
environmental officials, to keep the records out of regulators'
hands. The records were given to an outside attorney, Lawrence J.
Straw Jr., to ``cloak'' them in the attorney-client privilege, said
Wiley's brief.
   The brief cited a May 30, 1985, memo from another Mobil Chemical
lawyer, Charles S. Lindberg, to Bowman explaining that the
attorney-client privilege ``is much broader and receives greater
protection under the law than most of our company documents which
are not protected by legal privilege.
   ``In fact, it would be more difficult for any governmental
agency to obtain any of the information delivered to Mr. Straw than
it would for them to obtain that information from Mobil directly
under a subpoena,'' Lindberg wrote.
   ``I'm not going to excuse what Lindberg said,'' Gray commented,
calling the statement another example of ``lawyering.''
   He said all papers required by law to be at the Bakersfield
plant never left there. Two or three boxes of documents were sent
to Straw, but have never been subpoenaed, he said.
   As an example of alleged ``sanitizing'' of environmental reports
by lawyers, Bowman's brief refers to Colbert's Jacksonville memo.
   Colbert wanted the word ``fully'' placed before ``acquainted''
in the sentence, ``Plant personnel have not had time to become
acquainted with'' Superfund reporting procedures, according to
court papers.
   In a report about the Frankfort, Ill., plant, Colbert added
``Records do not indicate that'' to the sentence, ``the plant is
not consistently reporting excursions within five days of becoming
aware of the incident.''
   Mobil says the second ``not'' was accidental and that the other
two changes made the reports more accurate.

<HEAD>Former Employee Says Firm Covered Up Microchip Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Hughes Aircraft Co. engineer
has filed a $9.6 billion lawsuit against the company charging that
it concealed a potential defect in computer chips used in defense
systems.
   The lawsuit was dismissed as mostly ``fantasy'' by a Hughes
official.
   Metallurgist Michael C. Denlinger, a former senior staff
engineer at a Hughes division here, filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Santa Ana last June, but it remained sealed until
it was served on Tuesday.
   Denlinger claims that more than 4 million computer chips used in
national defense systems may corrode because Hughes took a shortcut
in a soldering process that can cause cracks in what should be
airtight surfaces.
   ``We think our national security is compromised,'' his attorney,
Frank Barbaro, said Tuesday.
   Denlinger, who worked for Hughes for 14 years and was most
recently responsible for testing strengths of materials, brought
the action under the federal False Claims Act, which allows
whistleblowers to share in damage awards in defense fraud cases.
   Damages in false claims cases are usually triple the value of
the products. Denlinger's attorneys claim the company sold $3.2
billion worth of systems using the allegedly faulty computer chips.
   The U.S. Department of Justice must decide whether to join such
false claims lawsuits, which usually are sealed while the
department investigates.
   The department told the federal court that its research of the
Hughes case was complete, and court papers indicated the department
would make a decision on the case within 60 days.
   Denlinger alleges that defective chips installed since 1984
caused two failures in the Navy's submarine-launched Advance
Capability torpedo system.
   While routine screening found two defective chips in torpedoes,
the lawsuit's allegations are wrong, said Dan Reeder, a spokesman
for Hughes' Ground Systems Group in Fullerton.
   ``Most of the stuff is just fantasy,'' he said. ``We have never
had any failure of the test torpedoes due to hardware problems
during any of the hundreds of runs we have gone through.''
   Denlinger said in the lawsuit that he repeatedly wrote memos
about possible cracking of the chips but they were ignored. He
resigned in November 1988.
   Hughes said Tuesday that it has inspected every chip since
becoming aware of a cracking problem in 1985, and said it was an
industry-wide problem.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission,
catapulted into the headlines by its pursuit of multimillion-dollar
insider trading scandals, is putting out the word that it intends

   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden is creating a new fraud unit at the

   Investigators have charged that some small investors lost their

federal deposit insurance.
   ``We intend to see to it that when people are sold securities,
they are provided all the necessary information,'' Breeden said.
   Breeden also announced Tuesday that he had selected William R.

   Orange juice prices leaped on the futures
market after a weekend freeze overwhelmed Florida and Texas citrus
groves, but experts said consumers may escape big price increases
because of a bumper crop in Brazil.
   However, Big Chill '89 likely will drive up vegetable prices in
the Northeast because the cold wiped out thousands of acres of
carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and other crops in Florida,
agriculture officials said.
   Experts assessing the damage Tuesday said it was too early for
definite predictions about prices. U.S. Agriculture Department
economist Ralph Parlett in Washington said price increases were
likely, but he hadn't changed his earlier forecast of a 3 percent
to 5 percent overall rise in food prices in 1990.
   In Florida, where the citrus industry is worth an estimated $3.5
billion a year, the Christmas cold wave struck with about 80
percent of the citrus crop still on the trees, and there was heavy
icing of oranges and grapefruit. In Texas, an estimated 65 percent
of the crop _ or $55 million worth wholesale _ was still on the
trees, according to growers and farm officials.

<HEAD>Decade Unleashes Religious Right And East European Believers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In religion, the decade of the 1980s started with a plunge into
politics by America's ``religious right'' and is ending with a
burst of new freedoms for believers within the Soviet orbit.
   Over the past 10 years, the religion domain also has been jolted
with scandals, hit with jail terms for ``sanctuary'' workers and
shaken with conflicts over homosexuality, the Bible and abortion.
   Simultaneously the quest for Christian unity, though flagging
from its earlier euphoria, nevertheless made substantial strides.
So did closer Jewish-Christian relations, despite rocky moments.
   But the main religious hallmarks of the 80s were the burst into
U.S. political activism by church conservatives and the burgeoning
of religious rights in lands long shackled under atheist statism.
   The freshening spiritual breath in Eastern Europe emanated in
part from the churches themselves and from that surprising Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Capping the trend was the unprecedented friendly meeting this
year between Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II. The Vatican was
scorned by previous Soviet leadership as impotent for lack of
military power.
   But while religious opportunities grew in most Communist areas,
even in China despite the brutal anti-democracy suppression last
summer, the churches met persistent harassment in Latin American.
   But they also became bastions of human rights there, although a
long line of Christian workers were slain, particularly El Salvador
and Guatamala, along with thousands of civilians.
   The decade there began with the assassination of El Salvador's
Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980 and ended in 1989
with the murder of six Jesuit priests.
   U.S. churches entered a sanctuary movement to shelter refugees
fleeing the strife-ridden area. But the formerly open movement
edged underground after several participants were convicted in 1986
of smuggling aliens.
   A key religious development of the decade was the emergence into
public affairs of the long insular religious right, which had
previously denounced such activity as meddling in politics.
   But they surged from their spiritual closet in l980, along with
their paragon, former President Ronald Reagan, claiming credit for
electing him that year and again in 1984.
   The changed mode was sparked by a suave Virginia preacher, Jerry
Falwell, who founded Moral Majority in l979, and led it through 10
years of robust politicking, closing it down only this year.
   ``Mission accomplished,'' he said, adding that other
conservative Christian lobbying groups had evolved to handle the
cause.
   The movement's prime objectives _ public school prayer, tuition
tax credits for church schools and stopping abortion _ remained
unaccomplished. But ferment continued about them.
   A conservative tide also swept the Southern Baptist Convention,
where fundamentalists gained the presidency in 1979 and held it
through l989, broadening control throughout that biggest Protestant
body.
   It was a battle for the Bible, fundamentalists contended,
gradually imposing their demand for literalist ``biblical
inerrancy'' _ historically and scientifically _ on denominational
agencies.
   Meanwhile, mainline denominations suffered declines in
membership, and their chief cooperative organization, the National
Council of Churches, fell into operational and financial disarray
late in the decade.
   But remodeling work was underway, with efforts to bring more
evangelical churches and Roman Catholicism into full membership.
   Also, quiet but steady progress continued on the ecumenical
front.
   Northern and Southern Presbyterians, separated since the Civil
War, united in 1983 into the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) and three
branches of Lutherans united in 1987 into the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America.
   Of wider significance, a stream of world-wide, largely favorable
responses flowed into the World Council of Churches to a remarkably
inclusive ``convergence agreeement.''
   Dealing with key issues dividing churches _ baptism, eucharist
and ministry _ the ``BEM'' document was produced by representatives
of Protestantism, Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy at a l982
meeting in Lima, Peru.
   The deepening ties were dramatized at a giant largely Baptist
rally in Columbia, S.C., where the pope preached on his 1987 U.S.
trip, flanked by leading figures of most U.S. denominations.
   But he had a tense session with his U.S. hierarchy in Los
Angeles, where bishops told him Americans were used to being
persuaded rather than told what to believe. But he insisted
dissenters were't good Catholics.
   Seeking to tighten Vatican controls, he stripped noted moral
theologian Charles Curran of teaching credentials in 1986 and
temporarily curtailed the authority of Seatle Archbishop Raymond
Hunthausen, restoring it in 1987.
   The Vatican's mid-decade repudiation of homosexualty as a
``moral disorder'' continued to stir sharp resentments and
disruptions in Catholic churches.
   Sex scandals hit two prominent television evangelists, Jimmy
Swaggart and Jim Bakker. Baker resigned his PTL network in 1987
over a sexual tryst and in 1989 was convicted and imprisoned for
defrauding contributors.
   Swaggart was defrocked in 1988 for sexual misbehavior after he
refused to to accept disciplines imposed by his denomination, the
Assemblies of God.

   Temporarily, at least, Manuel Antonio Noriega
picked his own prison by taking refuge at the Vatican embassy in
Panama City _ where Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney thinks the
ousted military boss might be a long-term resident.
   That's not what the administration wants, but worse things could
happen, and have. So long as the deposed military boss of Panama is
a cloistered fugitive, he is isolated, silenced and confined to
small compound, living in a spare, single room.
   Despite Washington's sharp demands that the Vatican turn over
Noriega, the U.S. stake to the right of embassy refuge seems more
important than his case, so long as he is out of power and
neutralized. American embassies sometimes have been havens for
dissenters, notably in Cold War Hungary and now Beijing.
   U.S. officials argue that Noriega should not be granted asylum
because he is a common criminal, not a political fugitive. In his
case there is solid evidence of it, but totalitarian governments
have no difficulty constructing criminal charges against their
dissenters.
   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife took refuge in the
American embassy in Beijing more than six months ago, after the
government crushed the democracy movement and began a purge of its
leaders. He's still there, despite repeated protests from the
Chinese, who say the United States is interfering in their internal
affairs.
   For 15 years, Cardinal Josef Mindszenty lived in asylum in the
U.S. Embassy in Budapest. He had been freed from a Communist prison
in the Hungarian uprising of 1956, and took refuge at the embassy
after the Soviet Union put down that rebellion. The Vatican finally
was able to arrange his release to the West in 1971.
   Embassies are considered to be the territory of the nations they
represent, and when they choose to grant haven, even the most
dictatorial of regimes have accepted it.
   Now, as Cheney said, lawyers and diplomats are trying to figure
out what happens next in the Noriega case. He left open the
possibility that it could be nothing.
   Cheney said Tuesday that the embassy is surrounded, with no way
out for Noriega and no way in for U.S. authorities. ``It could be
that they'll have a long-term resident in their embassy in Panama
City,'' he said.
   Noriega would hardly seem a welcome guest; church leaders
including Monsignor Jose Sebastian Laboa, the papal nuncio in
Panama City, had long been critics of the general's regime. The
Vatican embassy had been a refuge for Noriega opponents when they
needed one.
   Unless there is a deal to let Noriega go to exile rather than to
U.S. trial, the ousted dictator can keep hiding, but he can't run.
   ``At present, if he leaves the embassy under any circumstances,
he will in fact be arrested by U.S. forces and returned to the
United States,'' Cheney said Tuesday.
   Embassy refuge does not apply outside an embassy compound, so as
soon as Noriega stepped outside guarded Vatican mission, he could
be seized.
   The way around that would be a diplomatic deal to let him go
into exile. It would have to be distant and silent, lest he regain
his voice and try to incite his supporters against the new
government.
   For all the demands that Noriega go on drug trial, the
administration had been willing as recently as October to let him
go into exile without prosecution if he yielded power.
   The Vatican has no extradition agreement with the United States
so if the church decided Noriega should be expelled from the
diplomatic mission, it would be to the custody of the Panamanian
government.
   The Panamanian constitution forbids the extradition of any
citizen. Guillermo Endara, the new president installed with
American protection after Noriega was ousted, said if his
government had custody, he could not deliver the dictator for U.S.
drug trial.
   The fledgling Endara government, apparent winner of the May
elections Noriega annulled, needs to establish itself and display a
power to govern independent of the United States. Yielding up
Noriega would be counterproductive. But the Endara government could
put him on trial as a killer; there have been U.S. hints that
prosecution in Panama might be acceptable.
   Until and unless the diplomats find a solution, Noriega
presumably stays put, a captive in spare surroundings that mock the
luxuries of his days in power, the cash, cocaine and voodoo cults
said to have been his lifestyle.

   It's an accomplishment when a writer can get
even one television series going, but Dean Hargrove has two hits on
the air and next week launches two more shows.
   ``Father Dowling Mysteries,'' previously on NBC, makes its debut
on ABC next Thursday. ``Max Monroe: Loose Cannon'' premieres on CBS
on Friday.
   Hargrove also created NBC's ``Matlock'' and CBS' ``Jake and the
Fatman.'' Earlier, he also developed the very successful series of
``Perry Mason'' movies for NBC. His frequent collaborator is Joel
Steiger.
   ``Everybody has a theory about why a show is successful,'' said
Hargrove. ``I think the audience basically is attracted by
characters, and when you have that perfect wedding of character and
performer you have a success.
   ``Most successful TV series are identified by a name: Lucy,
Archie Bunker, Columbo, J.R. Even with shows like `thirtysomething'
or `L.A. Law,' I think people tune in for the characters.
Basically, I tailor shows for the stars, like Andy Griffith, Bill
Conrad and Tom Bosley.''
   ``Loose Cannon'' stars Shadoe Stevens as Max Monroe, a police
detective whose wild and unconventional tactics have earned him the
nickname of Loose Cannon. Stevens is a rock 'n' roll disc jockey
who is host of ``American Top 40'' and a panelist on ``Hollywood
Squares.''
   ``It's a new kind of show for us,'' said Hargrove, whose partner
is Fred Silverman, former president of NBC and former head of
programming at CBS and ABC. ``The series we've done so far have
been traditional, middle of the road series.
   ``Working with Shadoe gives us an opportunity to design a show
that's offbeat and contemporary. It has a strong vein of humor. I
think almost all successful shows have had humor. I got my start as
a comedy writer and I still think of myself as a comedy writer.''
   ``Father Dowling'' stars Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson as two
ecclesiastical snoops. He's the good father, Frank Dowling, and
she's Sister Steve. Father Dowling is always running afoul of
church hierarchy in the person of James Stephens as Father
Prestwick, the bishop's aide. The show's set in Chicago, but like
``Perry Mason,'' it's filmed in Denver.
   The next ``Perry Mason'' movie, however, has been filmed in
Paris. It's the 14th in the series since Silverman sold the project
to NBC.
   ``Fred talked to Raymond Burr, got the rights and got NBC
interested,'' Hargrove said. ``He asked me to write the script. We
thought it would be a good idea to bring in a younger character, so
we cast William Katt as Mason's investigator.
   ``My notion was to put a detective story in the middle of `Perry
Mason.' The detective gets an assignment early and goes off to
pursue it. Perry Mason carries on his mystery-solving, and the
detective works on solving another element of the case. Katt has
left, but we use the same technique with Bill Moses.''
   In the show set in Paris, Mason defends an American Marine
officer in a court-martial.
   Hargrove grew up in Iowa and began writing student films while
in college. He attended the UCLA Film School as a graduate student,
but dropped out to write professionally.
   His first job was writing for ``The Bob Newhart Show,''
Newhart's first series on NBC in 1961-63.
   ``Newhart was the button-down mind just out of Chicago,'' he
said. ``We wrote a lot of telephone routines for him. Roland Kibbe
hired me and we later worked together on `Columbo' and `Madigan.' I
also wrote for `The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' because they wanted to
bring a sense of humor to the show.''
   Hargrove wrote the pilot for ``The Girl From U.N.C.L.E'' and was
story consultant for ``It Takes a Thief.'' He wrote and produced
Gene Barry's segments on ``Name of the Game.'' He was also producer
and writer for such series as ``Columbo,'' ``Madigan,''
``McCloud,'' ``McCoy,'' ``The Family Holvak'' and ``Me and Mom.''

<HEAD>Zorro Rides Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the New Year arrives, so will a gallant
masked figure from the past of old Spanish California. With sword
flashing, black cape billowing, white teeth gleaming, here comes
... Zorro?
   Yes, by neddies. Zorro. With a Z. It's the latest in a long line
of Zorros that includes the ABC series of 1957-59 that set millions
of tykes to running about in Zorro costumes, trying to puncture
each other in the name of justice.
   That one starred Guy Williams. This one, starring Duncan Regehr,
36, is the first new ``Zorro'' series ever on cable, specifically
the Family Channel, where the half-hour series will debut on Jan. 5.
   The show's star, a Canadian with Shakespearean stage credits, is
a very big Zorro. He stands 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 215
pounds. Were this a ``Zorro'' of fistics, not fencing, he'd be
right at home.
   This is because Regehr, a soft-spoken man with a dry sense of
humor, regularly used to put his dukes for sport. He once thought
of seeking a spot on Canada's Olympic boxing team. He fought 65
amateur bouts, he says, and had only three losses, none of them by
knockouts.
   It did enter his mind that a flattened nose might be bad for
someone seeking work as the handsome leading man in a work by
Shakespeare. ``That's why it was kind of dumb idea, don't you
think?'' he wryly asks.
   But that was when he was in his late teens, when the notion that
he could get his face rearranged had not quite sunk in: ``No, at
that age I think I was so stupid and cocky that I figured it
wouldn't happen to me.
   ``And fortunately I got out before it did. I hope.''
   Regehr's dossier includes such varied work as ``Hamlet'' at
Ontario's Stratford Shakespeare Festival and the role of the late
Erroll Flynn in CBS' ``My Wicked, Wicked Ways.''
   He shot 25 ``Zorro'' episodes in Spain this fall.
   The new series takes place, as have most `Zorro'' films, in
California in 1820. Regehr has, as have others before him, a
two-role part _ the dandy Don Diego Vega who really is the masked
Senor Zorro who zips about righting wrongs and leaving his
trademark ``Z'' carved in various places.
   George Hamilton played things for laughs _ and with a gay
look-alike brother _ in 1981's ``Zorro, The Gay Blade.'' So did CBS
in 1983 with a contemporary ``Zorro and Son,'' which was the sort
of show in which a Franciscan monk was arrested for ``selling wine
before its time.''
   But in this edition, done in the old romantic tradition, Don
Diego, usually played as a popinjay or even a fop, doesn't get that
treatment from Regehr:
   ``I've played hm more like a Renaissance man, interested in art,
science and music, more bookish rather than being, er, a little
light on the feet.''
   The actor, the son of an artist and a painter himself, has lived
for the past ten years in Los Angeles. But he and his wife,
Catherine, have a New Year's project _ to move to Vancouver Island
in British Columbia.
   He would keep a place in Los Angeles and commute there for film
and TV work, he says. But he no longer wants to call it home. ``I
did sort of like it 10 years ago, when it wasn't as crowded or
smog-filled,'' he says.
   Not now. And he has found that there is such a thing as too much
mellow, of which there is said to be a lot in Hollywood.
   In the old days, Regehr says, ``I could deal with the people
there, the `laid-backness.' Now, I don't know. It just seems too
relaxed to me.''

   It is possible the show's ratings won't be very big.

<HEAD>Tough Choices For Income-Minded Savers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The financial menu looks pretty skimpy as
income-conscious investors consider where to put their money for a
new year and a new decade.
   No matter how far in time you are willing to extend yourself,
alluring returns on certificates of deposit, bonds and other
interest-bearing investments are hard to find these days.
   Certainly, you are unlikely to come across anything now that
matches the two-digit yields on low-risk securities that were so
commonly available in the early 1980s.
   But inflation has also declined in recent years, and so has the
maximum rate at which the federal government taxes most people's
interest income. So, in the view of many analysts, the ``real''
returns offered now aren't as stingy as they might look.
   Suppose as 1990 begins that you can get a yield of 8.3 percent
from a CD or money-market mutual fund. If your income tax bracket
is 28 percent _ the top rate that applies to most savers and
investors _ you have a return of 6 percent left over after Uncle
Sam takes his cut.
   After taking into account consumer inflation in the 4 percent to
5 percent annual range, you still emerge with a positive return.
   On paper at least, that beats the results you might have
achieved at a nominal interest rate of, say, 13 percent a decade
ago, when inflation and taxes together would have left you actually
in the red.
   Of course the current returns savers and investors can get are
only part of the story. The ideal investment choice also must keep
looking good through the future ups and downs of inflation and
interest rates.
   Right now, many analysts are predicting at least a modest
decline in interest rates over the next several months. That would
argue in favor of longer-term investments such as CDs or bonds
rather than short-term options such as money market funds.
   Unfortunately, interest rates at present are such that you get
paid little or nothing for making that kind of longer-term
commitment.
   A recent tally by the Bank Rate Monitor showed three-month CDs
yielding an average of 7.87 percent; two-year CDs 7.71 percent, and
five-year CDs 7.73 percent.
   This is known in financial circles as a flat, or slightly
``inverted,'' yield curve, and it is abnormal although by no means
unprecedented in modern history.
   The yield curve has been out of kilter for more than a year now.
But some analysts think it is slowly beginning to resume a more
orthodox shape.
   For now the Value Line Investment Survey, the nation's largest
independent investment advisory service, recommends keeping your
options open by sticking mainly with short-term commitments. ``A
bit more patience,'' the firm urges, ``a wait until the long rate
offers more of a yield advantage to warrant the added risk.''
   Staying short-term, of course, also gives you protection should
interest rates pull a surprise by heading higher. In that event,
yields on vehicles such as money market funds would stand to move
up as well.
   What if interest rates should neither rise nor fall, but hover
around present levels for some indeterminate period?
   That would create few opportunities for investors to pull off
heroic coups of market timing. But it would leave enough goodies to
go around that hardly anyone need be entirely dissatisfied.
   ``The sideways scenario isn't bad for either camp,'' observed
Edward Yardeni, economist at the Wall Street firm of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``The bulls earn the coupon (or nominal interest rate on
long-term investments), and since the yield curve is flat, the
bears earn a comparable return in the short-term money markets.''

<HEAD>Uprisings As Much Economic As Political</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fury of Romanians against their former
government is revealed partly by the economic statistics. Romania,
in recent years, has been the economic backwater of Eastern Europe.
   Alone among those nations _ Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary and Poland _ the country's gross national product
and industrial production declined in 1988.
   Its GNP last year, in fact, was about where it was in 1980,
while almost every other developed nation, communist and
non-communist, registered increases. In that time China more than
doubled its GNP.
   While Romania's neighbors increased exports between 1980 and
1986, its exports stagnated. Romania's population of 23 million is
exceeded only by that of Poland, but Romania's imports were lower
than any fraternal East Bloc country.
   Its per capita gross national product of $5,500 also remains the
lowest in Eastern Europe, less than one-half that of East Germany,
and it is falling.
   Whereas East Germans had an automobile-to-population ratio of
one to five, in Romania the ratio was just a bit more than one in
100. While Romanian meat production averaged 70 kilograms per
capita, that of Hungary was 160.
   In effect, the old government was leading the nation into
economic decline and lower living standards at a time when growth,
if perhaps slowly, was the rule in every other European country,
possibly excluding tiny Albania.
   The profile of economic deterioration amid growth emerges from
research completed in August and published in September by the
Central Intelligence Agency. It shows a vivid contrast between
communist and capitalist nations.
   The figures also suggest the urgent need of the Soviet Union to
renovate and spur its own economy, in which growth rates have
steadily deteriorated in recent years.
   The CIA research shows Soviet GNP falling from average annual
growth of 4.8 percent in 1961-65 and 4.9 percent from 1966-70, to
3.1 percent in 1971-75, 2.1 percent in 1976-80 and 1.9 percent in
1981-85.
   After a 4 percent spurt in 1986, mainly the result of a 10.3
percent surge in agricultural production, the GNP growth rate
subsided to 1.3 percent in 1987 and 1.5 percent in 1988.
Agricultural production shrank in the latter years.
   Reviewing the numbers, and contrasting them with those of the
capitalist world, it's clear that the economies of the communist
countries as a whole were becoming outmatched.
   In 1988, the annual rate of GNP growth in the United States,
Canada, Japan, Australia and all countries of Western Europe,
Yugoslavia excepted, exceeded that of the Soviet Union and the
Soviet bloc nations of Eastern Europe.
   Even the economies of the less developed countries, taken as a
whole, showed a growth rate of 3.7 percent, or higher than the
Soviet Union and the Communists nations of Eastern Europe.
   Among the large communist nations, a swiftly industrializing
China stands out, registering a growth rate of 11.2 percent in
1988, the third time since 1983 in which it has reached
double-digit levels.
   The stark contrast between the communist and non-communist
nations that emerges from the data emphasizes the economic origins
of the upheavals.
   In an age of developing communications, that contrast was
obvious to all, except perhaps for a few leaders.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Picked Top `Religion Newsmaker' Of 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although he ostensibly is not a religious man,
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is the top ``religion
newsmaker'' of 1989, according to specialists in reporting that
field.
   A poll of members of the Religion Newswriters Association made
that choice, and also picked the extraordinary meeting of Gorbachev
and Pope John Paul II as the No. 1 religion news story of the year.
   It was the first meeting ever between a pope and leader of a
government that for decades has upheld atheism and spurned
religion, shackling it. But Gorbachev, baptized as an infant but a
committed Communist, broke the pattern.
   ``We need spiritual values,'' he told the pope.
   The meeting presaged diplomatic relations between the two, long
antagonistic leaderships, cleared the way for a possible papal
visit to the USSR and brought assurances from Gorbachev of
broadened religious freedoms.
   Those expanding religious freedoms already were proliferating in
the Soviet orbit _ in the swift shift toward democracy in East
Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia _ in what some hailed
as a triumph of faith over Marxism.
   That tide, and the fading of restrictions on religion in that
area, even ahead of revised statutes, was picked by religion news
specialists as 1989's third ranked religion story.
   ``A lot of that reform movement was fueled by the churches,''
said religion reporter Bill Thorkelson of Minneapolis who compiled
the survey results. ``By and large, that aspect hasn't been told.''
   The second-ranked religion story was the trial, conviction and
sentencing of television evangelist Jim Bakker to 45 years in
prison and $500,000 in fines for defrauding contributors. He had
quit his network in 1987 in a sex scandal.
   Other religion events ranked in this order:
   Fourth _ The murder of six Roman Catholic priests and jailing
and torture of other church workers in El Salvador, sparking new
demands by religious groups for an end to U.S. military aid to that
nation.
   Fifth _ Worldwide controvery over publication of Salman
Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses,'' which Islamic zealots called
blasphemous and degrading to the prophet Mohammed. Iranian death
threats sent Rushdie into hiding.
   Sixth _ Election by the Massachusetts diocese of the Episcopal
Church of Barbara Clementine Harris, 55, as suffragan bishop, the
first woman to become a bishop in the worldwide Anglican communion.
   Seventh _ A warning by U.S. Catholic bishops to politicians
against taking pro-choice stands on abortion. Lucy Killea, running
for the California state Senate, did so and was barred from Holy
Communion by San Diego's Bishop Leo Maher. She won.
   Eighth _ The Rev. George Augustus Stallings Jr., a Washington
D.C., Catholic priest, was suspended after he formed his own
African-American congregation in Washington, D.C., calling
Catholicism racist.
   Ninth _ The Vatican backed relocation of a Carmelite convent
from the Auschwitz death camp after Polish Cardinal Jozef Glemp
outraged Jews and some Catholic prelates with his comments about
Jews in the controversy.
   Tenth _ Religious leaders condemned suppression of a student
democracy movement in China, and the Dalia Lama, exiled Tibetan
Buddhist leader, receives the Nobel Peace Prize in a move to point
up the brutal crackdown.
   Besides picking the top-rated religion stories, religion
reporters singled out incidents that tended to cover up religious
affairs and stifle the public's right to know.
   Cited for first place in this ``Into the Darkness Award'' was
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, who went into closed
session for an entire afternoon at their Novermber meeting and
refused to disclose even their topic.
   Second place went to the Southern Baptist Convention at which
newly predominant fundamentalist trustees of denominational
agencies summoned executives behind closed doors to lay down
tightened rules.
   Other ``darkness'' citations went to Episcopal bishops, who
barred reporters from small-group discussions about women bishops,
and the United Church of Christ, which refused to divulge vote
totals in election of the denomination's new president in which a
white won over a black. Church officials said people simply should
take their word on the outcome.

   The World Council of Churches has
made new grants totalling $635,000 to organizations fighting
racism, one of them a South Africa-banned group which dominated
recent elections in adjoining Namibia.
   The largest grant from the council's fund to combat racism,
$165,000, went to the South West African People's Organization,
SWAPO, which garnered 57 percent of votes to elect 41 of 72 members
of Namibia's assembly which is to produce a constitution for the
newly forming state.
   SWAPO's chairman, Sam Nujoma, who presided at the assembly,
``expressed gratitude for the role churches have played in the
struggle'' for Namibia's independence from South Africa, reports a
U.S. observer, Diane Porter, the Episcopal Church's deputy for
public policy.
   Three other groups fighting white-minority rule in South Africa
and previously in Namibia also received major grants, including the
African National Congress.
   The fund, supported by designated contributions, mainly from
European churches and governments, makes grants only for
humanitarian, non-military purposes. Since 1970, the fund has made
grants totalling $8,716,000.

Barbara C. Harris as suffragan, or assistant, to the Episcopal
bishop of Massachusetts. The Episcopal Church is among 28 national
provinces of world Anglicanism.
   In distinction from the American case, Bishop-Elect Jamieson,
47, will head a diocese with jurisdiction over its priests and
parishes. The New Zealand church has been ordaining women as
priests since 1977, and lists 94 women among its 800 clergy.
   Suffragan Bishop Harris, the first woman elevated to the U.S.
church's episcopacy, said of New Zealand's new bishop that ``being
a first is both a joy and a challenge. I wish for her the same joy,
support, and fulfillment that I have experienced here from the
people of Massachusetts.''

<HEAD>Strauss Meets Buffalo Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brahms loved Buffalo Bill's Wild West shows when
they played in Vienna and so, presumes conductor Zubin Mehta, did
Johann Strauss Sr. At any rate, Strauss composed ``Indian Maidens
Galop'' and Mehta will conduct the work with the Vienna
Philharmonic on New Year's Day.
   ``From Vienna: the New Year's Celebration 1990,'' Vienna's
traditional New Year's concert of effervescent Strauss music, will
be televised on Jan. 1 at 2:30 p.m. EST by PBS.
   ``There is such an output by the Strauss family, taking Johann
Strauss Jr. and Sr., cousins and uncles, we can go on for 10 years
of concerts without repeating a single piece,'' said Mehta, who was
born in India.
   However ``The Blue Danube Waltz'' and ``Radetzky March'' will be
repeated. They're played every year.
   ``The accent is on Vienna in this year's program,'' said Mehta,
who has never conducted a New Year's concert in Vienna. ``I'm doing
an overture, by Franz von Suppe, to `Morning, Noon and Night in
Vienna.''' Also on the program is Mehta's favorite by Strauss,
``Vienna Blood,'' which he has often presented as an encore when he
conducted the Vienna Philharmonic.
   ``They used to ask the music director of the opera to do it.
They have come to another sort of a plan now; each year they want
to ask another one of their regular conductors to take over. Next
year will be somebody else.''
   In an interview at his office in Avery Fisher Hall, Mehta said
he has watched the concert on TV in the past and will in the
future. ``I think Johann Strauss is as classical as Mozart is. The
pieces are played too much and without the right style, which tends
to diminish the quality of this music. When played in the right
style, it is sheer pleasure. It is the kind of music, like Mozart,
that one feels there's not an extra note.
   ``This music reflects an age before the turn of the century when
Vienna was the cultural center of the world. It's the height of the
Hapsburg monarchy that it reflects.''
   Mehta, 53-year-old artistic director of both the New York
Philharmonic and Israel Philharmonic, conducted the Vienna
Philharmonic last year in Amsterdam but hasn't toured with it. ``I
can't be music director to two orchestras and tour with a third
one. That wouldn't be fair to any side.''
   Last year, Mehta told the New York Philharmonic that when his
contract expires in 1991, he won't renew, even though he believes
the New York Philharmonic is one of the greatest orchestras around
today.
   ``I feel after 13 years of my contributions here, somebody else
should take over now,'' he said. ``New York takes its toll on your
spirit. Nobody can work harder than I can. But 13 years of playing
20 programs a season takes its toll on your inner person.
   ``And one has to be honest with oneself and say, I like to be
free. I'm going to do a lot but I'm going to do what I want. I'm
planning my freedom. I'm planning more free time and I'm also
planning projects. The next person waiting to meet me now is the
director of the Chicago Lyric Opera. From 1993 I'll be doing a new
Ring cycle in Chicago.''
   He also plans to record more operas.
   The physical part of conducting doesn't tire Mehta. ``It is that
inexplicable love and drive that you have from within for the music
that makes you supersede all these material discomforts.''
   In Florence, when he conducted ``Gotterdammerung,'' the fourth
and last opera in Wagner's Ring cycle, he said, ``You come out of
the pit after conducting two hours. The longest Mahler symphony is
an hour and a half. You've got the second and third acts to look
forward to. And I can't wait for the second act to begin! For me
these Wagner pauses are necessary because of stage changes and the
singers have to rest. But I can't wait to go back.''
   Mehta planned to fly to Vienna the Wednesday before New Year's.
   ``This concert is carefully prepared,'' he said. ``Though it's
music that comes out of their blood, there are four rehearsals and
two previous concerts, one for the Army, one for the public, to
prepare for it.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and its old East bloc allies
roared out of the 1980s on an incredible wave of reform that
shattered the very foundations of communism. They move now into the
1990s on an uncharted course of high hopes and deep concerns.
   One grim possibility came from Soviet journalist Alexander
Kabakov, writing in the monthly magazine Art of Film: It is the
mid-1990s and Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms have failed. The
Soviet Union has splintered into warring cantons. Famine grips the
land, and roaming gangs of thugs rule Moscow.
   His nightmare is no idle fancy for a people who have known
revolution, civil war and famine in this century. Again there is
widespread worry, disillusionment and lack of faith as the Soviet
Union, 72 years old, staggers into a new decade.
   In Eastern Europe, the Kremlin's allies are still aglow over the
contagious political reforms that toppled the region's last
hardline leader, Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu, in the final days of
the 1980s. But they are also girding for tough years ahead.
   ``Someone will have to tell Czechoslovaks they have to work
harder and earn less,'' warns the Czechoslovak economist Dusan
Triska.
   In Bulgaria, ``We can hardly point to a sub-branch and even a
single production which is competitive on free international
markets,'' says Premier Georgi Atanasov.
   A liberator of Eastern Europe who has also freed his own people
from decades of repression, the 58-year-old Gorbachev has failed to
deliver more tangible goods at home. As the 1990s dawn, and with
them the sixth year of Gorbachev's reign, there still are lines for
soap, matches, even sausage so foul it's called ``doggy delight.''
Many items aren't available at all.
   Communists no longer talk about burying capitalists; they want
to mimic them.
   ``Now we need your ideas. Now we need your lessons in
managing,'' Vitaly Korotich, editor in chief of Ogonyok magazine,
told Americans recently. Marxism hasn't adequately fed Soviets;
soon Big Mac will have a chance. Moscow's first McDonald's opens in
January.
   The 1990s pose history's greatest challenge for what was once
labeled ``the Soviet bloc.'' Erstwhile truths now discredited, Old
Guard leaders tossed in the trash bin of history, Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union want to become smoothly functioning components
in the modern world economic order.
   But can they?
   Even in Hungary, a pioneer in implementing free-market
practices, managers still have little concept of profit-oriented
thinking, competition and labor productivity ``where you pay those
who work and fire those who don't,'' says U.S. Ambassador Mark
Palmer.
   The specter of hard times looms everywhere:
   Hungary's government is proposing an austerity program
foreseeing a 15 percent increase in consumer prices and a slash in
state subsidies.
   Czechoslovakia, which had Europe's No. 6 economy before World
War II, must undo 40 years of Communist under-investment and shoddy
maintenance of industry.
   ``We will have to abolish many insufficient factories and
gradually open to the international market,'' says economist
Miroslav Slouf, deputy mayor of Prague. ``Any newly elected
government will be unpopular within months.''
   Inflation tops 600 percent in Poland, and Poles donate the
family silver and money hidden under mattresses to a fund to help
the nation. Economists in Warsaw, their desks piled high with dire
forecasts, struggle to draft a reform blueprint that will encourage
Western help.
   The coming austerity could have high political costs.
   Shorn of their legally guaranteed grip on power in Hungary, East
Germany and Czechoslovakia, Communists are now condemned to share
power and even lose it. Their Bulgarian comrades, possibly the
Romanians, and finally the Soviets, are fated to follow.
   Politicians more responsive to voter demands will bring even
more unraveling in the old Soviet bloc. Communism, borne into East
Europe on the bayonets of the Red Army in World War II, already
must compete with other creeds, like Solidarity-style trade
unionism and Roman Catholicism in Poland. The Kremlin is sending
signals it will brook virtually any style of reform, as long as its
allies stay in the Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   The late Soviet dissident Andrei Amalric wrote a book, ``Will
the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?'' It has, but enters the 1990s
riven by ethnic disputes that constitute the most violent menace
both to unity and Moscow's authority. This continent-sized land of
more than 100 nationalities is being unraveled by demands of
Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Estonians, Latvians and others.
   In the 1990s Gorbachev's Kremlin must placate those
nationalities or see the multi-ethnic empire the Bolsheviks seized
from the czars disintegrate. So far, the Kremlin's efforts have
largely failed. Using more traditional tactics _ repression _ would
cost the Soviets much of the good will they have accumulated abroad
in the Gorbachev era.
   More than anything else, the next Soviet decade depends on one
man, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, the stocky son of a southern
Russian peasant who is unquestionably one of the most gifted
political operators of the century. He may not be able to realize
his vision of a more modern, open, better working Soviet Union at
peace with the world. But it is impossible to imagine anyone else
doing it.
   The last rock of Stalinist stability in the Soviet bloc was
swept away by the reform tide on the eve of the 1990s, though not
without bloody resistance. Nicolae Ceausescu, 71, was driven from
power by a mass uprising of Romanians enraged that his security
forces had slain thousands of anti-government demonstrators.
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed on Christmas Day.
   That revolt, which lasted less than a week, was the final act in
a remarkable year that saw hardline leaders in Poland,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Bulgaria ousted by popular
pressure, street demonstrations and civic bravery.
   Still untouched, by all accounts, was Albania, which long ago
sealed itself up in a Stalinist mold apart from the world and now
is more alone than ever in a churning sea of change.
   But a joke making the rounds in Warsaw reflected a view of Poles
that the liberalization process they began is inevitable for all.
   The joke goes:
   Q. How long does it take to overthrow communism?
   A. Ten years in Poland, 10 weeks in East Germany, 10 days in
Czechoslovakia ... and 10 seconds in Romania.

<TEXT>
   Advances in science and technology promise to make the 10 years
that begin Jan. 1 a decade of unparalleled accomplishment. But
damage to the atmosphere, accumulation of solid wastes, the spread
of AIDS and other threats also make the 1990s a decade of potential
peril.
   ``Human beings now have the power to control their own fate to a
degree that they've never had before,'' said Edward Cornish,
president of the World Future Society.
   Topping the World Future Society's list of challenges for the
1990s: environmental damage to the Earth's climate, land, water and
atmosphere.
   Here, in capsules drawn from the reporting of Associated Press
specialists, is a look at some major areas of human endeavor and
concern for the coming decade:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE AIR ABOVE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The intertwined issues of air pollution, the ozone layer and the
greenhouse effect will all be high on the environmental agenda in
the 1990s.
   In smog-bound Los Angeles, authorities will try to change a way
of life by starting to wean commuters off gasoline-powered
automobiles. Other cities are likely to follow suit.
   Scientists, meanwhile, will train their instruments on the
thinning ozone in the stratosphere, a layer that shields the Earth
from ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer. A human
pollutant _ chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs _ is destroying the ozone.
Governments are trying to reduce CFC releases, but the question for
the 1990s is whether it is too little too late.
   Scientists almost universally agree that carbon dioxide and
other gases released into the atmosphere will produce the
greenhouse effect _ letting sunlight in, but not letting Earth's
heat out. But specialists disagree on when the warming will occur
and how bad it will be. Pessimists predict the 1990s will be even
warmer than the 1980s, one of the warmest recent decades.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SOLID WASTE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Specialists see an upcoming crunch on the garbage front: Half
the nation's 6,000 dumps will be filled and closed in the '90s.
   Said Bruce Weddle, director of the Environmental Protection
Agency's municipal solid waste program: ``By the end of the decade,
I think recycling is going to be part of the cultural fabric of
society. People will be separating out all bottles, cans,
newspapers, plastics, leaves and grass clippings instead of
throwing them in one can.''
   Americans now bury about 80 percent of their waste in dumps,
burn 10 percent and recycle the remainder. The EPA predicts
recycling will jump to 25 percent by 1992.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE AIDS EPIDEMIC</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization estimates that nine times more
people around the world will get AIDS in the 1990s than did in the
1980s. By the year 2000, there could be 6 million AIDS cases, and
18 million people could be infected.
   An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million Americans are now infected
with the deadly disease. Most, perhaps all, will eventually become
ill.
   Researchers cannot confidently predict a vaccine or cure in the
coming decade, but they believe AIDS could be subdued to the point
of becoming a chronic disease, one for which those infected must
take long-term medication.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HEART DISEASE-CANCER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   If current death rates continue, 13 million American lives will
be claimed in the 1990s by two big killers _ heart disease and
cancer.
   Medical researchers do not expect cures in the next decade.
Instead, they look for new insights to help them attack the
diseases from many directions.
   Better understanding of cancer-causing genes and how to block
them, for example, and of cancer-suppressing genes and how to
harness them, would give medical scientists crucial new weapons to
wield against cancer.
   New discoveries about the relationship of diet to heart disease
might lead to innovative treatments for the nation's leading killer.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GENETICS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Biologists who have uncovered the genetic causes of such
ailments as cystic fibrosis will turn their attention to the
genetics of human behavior in the 1990s.
   In human genes, scientists may find the roots of such complex
disorders as manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia.
Specialists believe understanding of some behavioral disorders
should come by the year 2000.
   ``I think this will be a tremendously exciting field in the next
10 years,'' says David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SPACE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   After years of tight budgets, American scientists hope the 1990s
will introduce a new ``golden age'' of space exploration.
   President Bush has proposed a major commitment to completing the
manned space station Freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base
on the moon and a manned mission to Mars early in the next century.
   The U.S. probe Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May,
is to orbit Venus next August. The probe Galileo, launched from a
shuttle in October, is to orbit Jupiter in 1995. En route, Galileo
will also study Venus and take the first closeup look at an
asteroid. In 1992, the Mars Observer will be launched, to orbit the
red planet for a multi-year examination.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, will continue development of a space
shuttle and exploit their own space station Mir, as they pursue
their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to Mars early in the
21st century.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MASS TRANSPORT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Specialists foresee more automobiles on the road in the 1990s,
on a U.S. highway system that will never keep pace.
   Experts say air pollution and possible oil shortages in the '90s
will spur production of cleaner, higher-mileage cars; increased use
of vehicles that run on methanol, natural gas, electricity or solar
power; construction of more trolleys and other ``light rail''
systems, and more vacation travel done by trains, planes and cruise
ships.
   Traffic management will include synchronized traffic lights,
metered on-ramps, car-pool and bus lanes, reversible traffic lanes,
staggered work hours, and limits on times trucks can move goods.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>COMPUTERS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The high technologists look ahead to a personal computer in the
1990s that will be a blend of 3-D television and quadraphonic
stereo with the hand controls of a video game machine and more
speed than car-sized mainframes of the 1980s.
   ``Multimedia'' computers will rival television for attention,
able to surround the user with, for example, the sights and sounds
of an early morning in Paris or an erupting Hawaiian volcano.
Experts say they will help educate the next generation of
video-hungry schoolchildren.
   Other advances expected in the '90s: Machine translation of
language, and telerobots with human guidance that will clean up
crippled nuclear reactors and scour sclerotic arteries.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>U.S. SOCIETY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Demographics will change the face of the U.S. factory and office
_ and of American society _ in the coming decade.
   The private Population Reference Bureau reports that in the
1970s, 24.1 million young people entered the workforce, in the
1980s only 18.0 million did so, and in the 1990s the number is
expected to decline to 15.6 million.
   Much of the dropoff is among non-Hispanic white males. Women and
minority-group members will account for more than 80 percent of all
new entrants in the labor force in the '90s, the bureau says.
   Some businesses, such as fast-food outlets, are already feeling
the shortage of new labor-market entrants and have begun seeking
out retired people to fill jobs.

   Prominent personalities in political life, science, the arts and
other fields were asked by The Associated Press to sum up their
views of new directions in the world in the 1990s. Here are their
responses:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING, French statesman and former president:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's exit from communism appears to be the most
difficult process to manage in the next 10 years. No doubt it will
involve periods of ... high inflation, and also political

<HEAD>Elizabeth Pena Plays Wife of Drug Agent Enrique Camarena</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Elizabeth Pena said she felt
fortunate that Mika Camarena agreed to meet with her before she
began playing the wife of a U.S. agent in the NBC miniseries ``Drug
Wars: The Camarena Story.''
   The three-part, six-hour series, which NBC will telecast on
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, tells the story of the kidnap-murder of
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena
five years ago in Mexico.
   The miniseries also stars Steven Bauer as Camarena and Craig T.
Nelson and Treat Williams as DEA agents. It's based on the book
``Desperados'' by Elaine Shannon.
   ``Mika had refused to meet with anyone else,'' said Pena. ``She
obviously didn't want to talk about it anymore. We met in her
attorney's office in San Diego. I came away admiring her greatly.
She was one of the forces behind getting justice for Kiki.
   ``She's a very centered person. She has great faith in God.
Elaine Shannon's book is very detailed, but Mika told me the
domestic things. Shopping, hosting the other DEA wives. I watched
her body language and how she thought things out before speaking. I
say whatever comes to mind. She's very careful, which I think comes
from being the wife of a DEA agent.''
   Camarena and his wife grew up along the border and attended high
school together in Calexico, a border town in California's Imperial
Valley.
   Camarena was stationed in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he was
abducted on Feb. 7, 1985. He was tortured and murdered by the drug
lords. DEA agents believed the crime was covered up by high
officials of the Mexican government, according to Shannon's book.
In this country, the Reagan Administration put a gag order on any
criticism of Mexico.
   The filmmakers, headed by executive producer Michael Mann,
stayed away from Mexico for their own safety and filmed instead in
Spain.
   Pena, who starred in ``La Bamba,'' ``Down and Out in Beverly
Hills'' and ``Batteries Not Included,'' auditioned for the role in
``Drug Wars.'' She has completed starring roles in the motion
pictures ``Blue Steel'' and ``Jacob's Ladder'' and is in the
upcoming NBC series ``Shannon's Deal.''
   ``A number of actresses tried out for the role,'' she said. ``I
felt more confident about the audition after I met the director,
Brian Gibson. Usually after an audition I think I should have done
this or that. I came back four times.''
   The last thing she did before ``Drug Wars'' was ``Shannon's
Deal,'' a movie pilot about a Philadelphia lawyer that was telecast
last June. It was written by John Sayles (''Eight Men Out,''
``Matewan'' and ``Return of the Secaucus Seven'') and stars Jamey
Sheridan. It has no air date but NBC scheduled it as a series after
it got a good rating and high critical acclaim.
   ``David Mamet will write and direct the first two shows, which
makes me a very lucky person,'' she said. ``I call it a Philip
Marlowe story. It's about a retired criminal lawyer who goes back
into practice. He wants to do it easy but winds up with a big case.
   ``My character's a kind of collage. She has a photographic
memory and she becomes his secretary.''
   It will be the third series for Pena, who also starred in
``Tough Cookies'' as Robby Benson's police partner and in ``I
Married Dora'' as a Latin American nanny who is about to be
deported and marries the widowed father of the children she looks
after.
   In ``Blue Steel,'' she plays the best friend of rookie
policewoman Jamie Lee Curtis. ``I'm a nice girl and it's so hard to
play nice,'' she said. ``I become the target for a thrill killer.
It's my first screen death. I did die in a stage production of
`Romeo and Juliet.' Twice, actually, since Juliet takes poison then
stabs herself.''
   She co-stars with Tim Robbins in ``Jacob's Ladder,'' a movie
that she said is about ``dying and letting go.''
   ``I'm a manifestation of his imagination,'' she said, ``but I
turn out to be something different.''
   Pena was born in Elizabeth, N.J., which became her namesake. She
spent most of her first eight years in Cuba, then was raised in New
York. At the age of 10 she followed her parents into the theater.
   Her husband, Steve Kibler, is a teacher at a junior high school
in the inner city. ``I met a school teacher from Kentucky in a soul
food restaurant,'' she said.

   Bargain hunters had reason to rejoice this Christmas, but store
owners had less cause for celebrating.
   Retailers rang up mostly respectable holiday sales gains but
many relied on profit-eating discounts to woo customers.
   Kurt Barnard, publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing
Report, said Tuesday that judging by the evidence so far, his
prediction of a 5 percent increase in holiday sales this year looks
accurate.
   To eke out the estimated increase _ which falls short of 1988's
7 percent rise above the prior year _ retailers had to accept lower
prices that pinched their profits.
   ``I think the consumer had a very, very merry Christmas and I'm
not so sure that the retailers did from a profit point of view,''
said analyst Linda R. Morris of PNC Financial Corp. in Philadelphia.
   Many stores still are stuck with too much inventory, so
post-Christmas price cutting is expected to be more extensive than
normal, Barnard said.
   Holiday shoppers lived up to their reputation as procrastinators
and didn't spend heavily until the final days before Christmas,
helping to salvage the season for some retailers. Last year, a
belated buying surge boosted business and more than made up for
earlier weakness.
   ``Thank goodness it came and pulled out the Christmas season,''
said Irwin Greenberg, president of Hess's Department Stores Inc.
Earlier, sales at the chain had been erratic _ healthy when the
weather was favorable for shopping and poor when it wasn't, he said.
   This past Saturday was the best day ever for Hess's, a
Pennsylvania-based chain of 76 department stores operating in 11
Eastern states and owned by Crown American Corp.
   Like other retailers, Greenberg said Hess's made a special
effort to get shoppers in the door. ``We were as promotional as you
can get. I don't know how you can get more promotional than this
Christmas season.''
   For Hess's, the merchandising tactic paid off. A big increase in
sales volume offset the price markdowns and the chain appears
likely to register unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter sales,
Greenberg said.
   Not every retailer had to resort to unusually intense
price-cutting. Dayton Hudson Corp., which operates the Target
discount chain and the Dayton Hudson and Mervyn's department
stores, said business this year was slightly less promotional than
in 1988. However, sales were good.
   ``We are very pleased with the results,'' said Kenneth A. Macke,
chairman and chief executive officer of the Minneapolis-based
retailer. ``We continue to expect a strong fourth quarter.''
   Deep discounts, giveaways and other promotional gimmicks have
been fiercest in the most competitive areas of the country,
particularly in cities where department stores owned by heavily
indebted Campeau Corp. operate.
   Campeau stores such as Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdines,
Lazarus and Rich's have been under pressure to generate sales to
cover the parent company's debt payments.
   Stores emphasizing clothing indicated they enjoyed better
results than general merchants, continuing a yearlong pattern.
Frigid weather in many parts of the country sent shoppers searching
for overcoats, sweaters, scarves and similar cold-weather garb,
retailers said.
   J. C. Penney Co. Inc., which does the bulk of its business in
clothing, finished the holiday season strongly, said spokesman
Duncan Muir. He said double-digit sales gains occurred at many
stores around the country run by the Texas-based retailer.
   The nation's biggest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., benefited
from a late surge in shopping, which reached a high point Saturday,
spokesman Ernest Arms said. But overall Sears holiday sales
probably will turn out to be about even with last year, when the
retailer reported a 12.1 percent jump in sales over 1987.
   Most of the major American retailers will issue reports Jan. 4
on their sales in the weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve.
   Cynthia Turk, a retail specialist with the accounting firm
Deloitte &amp; Touche, estimated that chains achieved sales gains of 5
percent to 8 percent over last year.
   ``The higher gains within this average clearly are among the
specialty stores,'' she said. ``There is, however, a lot of
disappointment because of the weak profitability environment.''

   Orange juice prices leaped on the futures
market after a weekend freeze overwhelmed Florida and Texas citrus
groves, but experts said consumers may escape big price increases
because of a bumper crop in Brazil.
   However, Big Chill '89 likely will drive up vegetable prices in
the Northeast because the cold wiped out thousands of acres of
carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and other crops in Florida,
agriculture officials said.
   Experts assessing the damage Tuesday said it was too early for
definite predictions about prices. U.S. Agriculture Department
economist Ralph Parlett in Washington said price increases were
likely, but he hadn't changed his earlier forecast of a 3 percent
to 5 percent overall rise in food prices in 1990.
   In Florida, where the citrus industry is worth an estimated $3.5
billion a year, the Christmas cold wave struck with about 80
percent of the citrus crop still on the trees, and there was heavy
icing of oranges and grapefruit. In Texas, an estimated 65 percent
of the crop _ or $55 million worth wholesale _ was still on the
trees, according to growers and farm officials.
   Fruit frozen on the trees can still be used for juice, as long
as it's picked and processed before the weather warms too much, and
crews raced through groves salvaging what they could.
   A large juice reserve in Florida, booming citrus production in
Brazil and swift processing of iced oranges should stabilize juice
prices somewhat, said Dan Gunter, executive director of the Florida
Department of Citrus.
   ``Because of that, there might be a more moderate impact than we
might expect for a freeze year,'' Gunter said.
   Ever-jumpy commodities traders ran up the price of frozen orange
juice futures _ in effect a contract to buy a set amount of juice
on a specified date.
   The contract for January delivery of frozen concentrated orange
juice jumped 16.1 cents to $1.531 a pound Tuesday on the New York
Cotton Exchange, an 11.8 percent gain. The contracts for March and
May delivery rose their permitted daily limits of 5 cents a pound.
   The freeze didn't affect California and Arizona citrus, which
generally is sold fresh rather than frozen for juice. Florida
farmers use about 90 percent of their oranges for juice and about
50 percent of the grapefruit.
   Consumers' biggest worry from the freeze appeared to be
vegetable prices. Florida farmers reported widespread damage to
vegetable crops from one end of the peninsula to the other, said
state Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner.
   Much of the winter vegetable crop was destined for the
northeastern United States, and central and south Florida growers
said thousands of acres of carrots, radishes, cauliflower and
broccoli were destroyed and that little would be salvageable.
   Near-total losses were reported in winter vegetables in large
areas of the state, and heavy losses of beans, squash, corn,
tomatoes and watermelons. Strawberries, ornamental plants and other
crops also were hard hit.
   ``With shortages, naturally prices will go up,'' Conner said.
   Vegetable losses are ``a more temporary kind of thing'' because
those crops can be replanted, noted the USDA's Parlett. Continued
production from California and Mexico could also cushion the blow,
he said.
   ``There's no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short,
and we'll probably see higher prices'' at produce counters, Parlett
said.
   Florida growers were optimistic that trees throughout the
700,000-acre citrus belt had been spared extensive damage.
Nevertheless, losses to the industry _ just starting to recover
from disastrous freezes in 1983 and 1985 _ were expected to be
heavy.
   ``Growers are concerned about their trees,'' said Bobby McKown,
executive vice president of Lakeland-based Florida Citrus Mutual, a
trade association of more than 12,000 growers. ``But right now, we
don't see the black leaves that we had in 1983.''
   Freeze fallout could include unemployment for thousands of
migrant farm workers. Once the rush to save the oranges subsides
and the crops disappear, those workers workers could lose their
jobs, said Charles Esposito, program manager for the Beth-El
Mission in Plant City.

<HEAD>Former Employee Says Firm Covered Up Microchip Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former employee of the Hughes
Aircraft Co. division here sued the company for $9.6 billion,
contending it covered up a potential defect in more than 4 million
computer chips used in defense systems.
   The suit was filed in June in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana
and was unsealed and served Tuesday, said Frank Barbaro, an
attorney for plaintiff Michael C. Denlinger.
   ``We think our national security is compromised,'' Barbaro said.
   The suit was brought under the federal False Claims Act, which
allows so-called ``whistleblowers'' to share in damage awards in
defense fraud cases.
   Denlinger, a former senior staff engineer at the Hughes
division, alleged that defective chips installed since 1984 caused
two failures in the Navy's submarine-launched Advance Capability
torpedo system.
   While routine screening found two defective chips in torpedoes,
but the suit's allegations are wrong, said Dan Reeder, a spokesman
for Hughes' Ground Systems Group here.
   ``Erroneous,'' Reeder said. ``We have never had any failure of
the test torpedoes due to hardware problems during any of the
hundreds of runs we have gone through.''
   The microchips were used in several defense systems, including
an information-processing system for the radar on board the U.S.S.
Vincennes, which mistakenly shot down an Iranian commercial
jetliner in 1988, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   In his suit, Denlinger said his repeated memos about possible
cracking of the chips because of a soldering process were ignored.
He resigned in November 1988.
   The basis for the unusually large multibillion-dollar damage
request was not immediately available.
   Hughes said Tuesday that it has inspected every chip since

<HEAD>United to Match Midway in Cutting Winter Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines, the nation's second largest
carrier, has announced it will match some winter fare cuts of as
much as 30 percent introduced by rival Midway Airlines Inc.
   United's action spread the fare-cutting that began last week
when Southwest Airlines Co. reduced prices on its longer routes, a
move other carriers followed on a limited basis.
   Midway, which operates its main hub out of Chicago's Midway
Airport, had announced one-way fares ranging from $19 to $99 across
its 50-city route system within the continental United States.
   ``The entire industry is seeing soft bookings the first
quarter,'' said Midway spokeswoman Laura Podlesny, in explaining
the fare cuts.
   Chicago-based United, whose main hub is at O'Hare International
Airport, said Tuesday it would match the fare cuts on routes where
it competes with Midway.
   ``We're going to be competitive, but not on all flights,'' said
United spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``In Dallas, Denver and Los Angeles,
for example, we'll offer the reduced fares on specific flights, but
not on all.''
   Midway reduced its Chicago-Los Angeles round-trip fare from $318
to $198, and its Chicago-Washington round-trip fare from $228 to
$158.
   The $39 round-trip fares _ $19 one way _ apply to routes
connnecting Chicago with Detroit and Kansas City. The fares
previously were $43.
   Midway officials waived minimum-stay requirements that usually
apply to discount tickets, but said the reduced-rate tickets must
be purchased by Jan. 20 and travel completed by March 31.
   United, the main holding of UAL Corp., did not specify whether
its fares would have minimum-stay requirements or expiration dates.

<HEAD>Firms Spent Record $32 Billion on Expense Accounts in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese firms spent a record 4.55 trillion yen, or
$32 billion, on entertainment and gifts in 1988, more than the
government plans to spend on defense next year, the National Tax
Administration Agency said Wednesday.
   Total expense account spending rose by 8.7 percent from the
previous high of 4.19 trillion yen, or $29 billion, in 1987, said
an agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the agency estimated total expense account spending
based on a survey of 57,599 of Japan's 1,851,653 companies that
closed their annual accounts in January 1989.
   The survey showed average expense account spending of 3 cents
for every $7 in company income, the official said.
   Japanese executives often are given carte blanche to entertain
at exclusive night clubs and Japanese-style inns. Inviting clients
for golf and presenting gifts are other customary entertainment
expenses.
   The government's draft budget for the fiscal year beginning in
April 1990 allocates 4.14 trillion yen, or $29.1 billion, for
defense spending, up 5.5 percent from fiscal 1989.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were little
changed in quiet early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade
as export optimism offset selling linked to warmer temperatures in
the nation's midsection.
   Trading was light, which is typical for a holiday period.
   The markets opened mostly lower, extending the weaker pattern
established Tuesday due to warmer temperatures in the Great Plains
and Midwest after a two-week cold spell.
   But selling pressure waned and buying interest surfaced early in
the session, partly reflecting the Agriculture Department's weekly
grain-inspections report, which showed unexpectedly large exports
of corn, wheat and soybeans last week.
   Some buying also stemmed from Spain's overnight purchase of
180,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and from expectations that
Pakistan will tender tonight for 26,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean
oil, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.10 a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged across the board with March at $2.38{ a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $1.52 a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to } cent lower with January at
$5.68\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .28 cent lower with February at
77.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with January at 85.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with February at 49.25 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .27 cent lower to .03 cent higher with
February at 49.50 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Tuesday.

   Slight losses early in Wednesday's session triggered new

<HEAD>ATM Usage During Holidays On The Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For many people, trips to crowded shopping malls, airports or
restaurants this holiday season weren't complete without a stop at
an automated teller machine.
   One of the world's largest ATM networks, Plus System Inc. of
Denver, predicts that between Dec. 1 and New Year's Day consumers
will have used the high-tech bank machines twice as much as last
year, largely for withdrawals.
   That's good news for many financial institutions who charge
anywhere from 10 cents to $3 per transaction for such ATM services
as cash withdrawals, deposits, transfers or balance inquiries.
   ``Consumers have clearly embraced the idea of using ATMs.
They've become more confident in technolgoy,'' said D.Dale
Browning, president of Plus System, which estimates its ATM
customers will withdraw more than $500 million through 6.5 million
transactions this month.
   At the same time usage has risen and the number of available
ATMs has grown since their introduction more than a decade ago, the
likelihood of fraud committed by and against consumers also has
increased, especially during the holidays, experts say.
   ``The potential for it to rise is there just as credit-card
fraud rose as people started to use their cards more and (thieves)
became more aware of how they can beat the system,'' said Marsha
Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Bankers Association in
Arlington, Va.
   There are few estimates available on ATM-related losses. But
some experts say it runs as high as $200 million a year and has the
potential to move into the billions as it has in the credit-card
industry.
   Bank of America in San Francisco narrowly escaped $14 million in
potential losses earlier this year after uncovering a scam in which
several insiders planned to use stolen secret codes of ATM
cardholders to withdraw money from 8,000 bank accounts. The group
planned to carry out the scheme with bogus bank cards made of
posterboard.
   A recent survey by the Washington-based American Bankers
Association found that 25 percent of the 1,200 banks polled
reported cases of fraud committed by a customer. Thirteen percent
reported fraud against a customer.
   The average financial institution had 62 cases of ATM fraud, or
about one incident for every 28,070 transactions, last year,
according to another study by Bank Administration Institute of
Rolling Meadows, Ill. That was down sharply from the 390 incidents
reported in 1986, due largely, the BIA says, to increased
safeguards by banks.
   ATM fraud can include from white-collar scams, such as thieves
withdrawing money after stealing bank customers' personal
identification numbers; strong-armed tactics, like robberies at ATM
locations; or overwithdrawals by customers.
   Still, fraud cases involving ATM cards are much rarer than with
credit cards. That's because in order to use an ATM card a thief
must also gain access to the person's personal identification code
_ usually a secret four-digit number punched into an ATM keyboard
to gain access to an account.
   Despite this safeguard, a significant number of ATM cardholders
_ about 25 percent by some accounts _ still make the mistake of
noting their PINs either on the back of their cards or somewhere in
their wallets. Purse snatchers, usually out in full force during
the holidays, often can figure out what the number stands for and
use it long before the card is missed.
   ``While it is important for you to read you monthly credit-card
statement to check for unauthorized charges, it's even more crucial
to read your bank statement to find unauthorized withdrawal through
an ATM,'' said Elgie Holstein, director of the consumer group
Bankcard Holders of America, in Herndon, Va.
   Holstein says consumers receive far less protection on ATM cards
than on credit cards. Liability from losses on an ATM card is $50
for the first two days after it is reported missing, the same as
with credit cards. But it rises to $500 for the next 60 days from
the time a bank statement is mailed out, after which there is
technically no limit.
   Financial institutions have built a number of safeguards into
the ATM system to prevent customers from seeing their savings wiped
out, such as placing limits on the amount of an ATM withdrawal per
transaction.
   In addition, the computers that operate ATMs are kept in high
security areas in financial institutions. The data that travels
across the wires each time a customer uses a machine is
``scrambled,'' meaning the information never travels across the
line the same way twice.
   Boris Melnikoff, vice chairman of the ABA's security and risk
management division, says technology exists to make it virtually
impossible for anybody but the cardholder to withdraw money from
his or her account. Among those being considered are identification
on the basis of fingerprints, handprints or a customer's retinas.
   ``(But) it has to be a practical approach,'' Melnikoff said.
``Not everyone might feel comfortable sticking their face in a
device so their retinas could be examined.''

   Worries persist on Wall Street that the economy will encounter
rocky going in the early stages of the new year.
   However, some analysts are predicting a relatively quick
recovery in business activity, given encouragement from a continued
easing of the Federal Reserve's credit policy.

   Sales of existing homes advanced 3.2 percent
in November, with a big jump in activity in the South spurring the
fastest growth rate in 11 months, a real estate trade group
reported Wednesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.59 million units last month, the best performance since sales
reached a rate of 3.92 million units in December 1988.
   The 3.2 percent October-to-November sales increase followed a
1.1 percent decline in October. It was the biggest percentage gain
since a 4.5 percent rise in August.
   Analysts credited declining mortgage rates for the upturn in
sales activity. But they said that housing sales presented a mixed
picture with some areas of the country such as the Northeast
hurting because of a rapid surge in prices in the past several
years.
   ``Some large, high-cost markets have experienced some softening
this year. However, many smaller, secondary cities are quite
strong,'' said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the realtors.
   He said the disparity in sales between high-cost areas and more
moderately priced markets should continue in 1990.
   Sluggish sales in high-cost areas has prompted some fears of a
coming housing recession, but Norman D. Flynn, president of the
realtors group, said the doomsayers would be proven wrong.
   ``People who are predicting hard times for housing are not
considering how much prices rose in high-cost areas over the past
few years,'' said Flynn, who cited the Northeast, where the median
price is up 85 percent from five years ago.
   Tuccillo predicted that falling mortgage rates would continue to
boost home sales in coming months. The national average for
fixed-rate mortgages dipped to 9.69 percent last week, down from a
high last March of 11.22 percent.
   The median price for homes sold in November edged up 0.4 percent
to $93,000.
   The West pulled ahead of the Northeast in November as the region
with the highest priced homes, recording a median resale cost of
$150,200 last month. The Northeast was second with a median price
of $145,800, followed by the South at $82,400 and the Midwest at
$70,900.
   The median is the point at which half the homes sold for more
and half for less.
   In November, the sales increase was led by a 9.2 percent jump in
sales in the South, where homes were sold at an annual rate of 1.42
million units in November. Sales were up 3.2 percent in the West to
an annual rate of 640,000 units. The Northeast posted a 1.7 percent
rise to an annual rate of 590,000 units.
   Sales in the Midwest were down 4 percent to an annual rate of
950,000 units.
   All of the percentage comparisons were with October sales rates.
When compared to sales in November 1988, the Midwest had a small
increase of 1.1 percent while activity in the South was up by 0.7
percent.
   However, sales in the Northeast are down 13.2 percent when
compared to a year ago while sales in the West are off by 5.9
percent compared to November 1988.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Watching Campeau Closely</HEAD>

   Manufacturers who supply merchandise to
Campeau Corp.'s department stores continued to watch Wednesday for
clues whether the retail operations would file for bankruptcy
protection.
   In the meantime, many of the clothing makers and other companies
that do business with the stores have stopped shipments or
postponed decisions about future shipments amid worries about
Campeau's solvency.
   Toronto-based Campeau's nearly 260 department stores around the
United States are continuing to sell and stock goods but executives
at some of the stores said this week that they have noticed
shipment disruptions.
   Campeau announced three weeks ago that its Cincinnati-based
retail divisions, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp., might seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy
court early next year.
   ``It's now a game of Russian roulette,'' said Alan Millstein,
publisher of the Fashion Network Report. ``The spigot's been turned
off on Seventh Avenue,'' he said referring to the New York garment
district where many apparel companies have their headquarters.
   ``The only way to turn it back on is some sort of resolution of
the current situation,'' he said.
   Merchandise credit companies and several clothing makers
announced before Christmas that they had suspended business with
Federated and Allied as a result of Campeau's financial problems.
   Federated and Allied warned in a quarterly financial statement
in mid-December that they might seek bankruptcy protection as early
as next month if $6.9 billion in debt can't be restructured. The
debt was created as part of Campeau's acquisition of the department
store chains.
   Among Campeau's chains are Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Rich's,
Abraham &amp; Straus, Lazarus and others.
   Donald Van Suilichem, senior vice president and director of
marketing at Atlanta-based Rich's, said there have been some
limited interruptions in shipments.
   ``We expect there will be some more. But at this point, it's
been really negligible,'' he said.
   One of Rich's vendors, New York-based Greif Cos., said it won't
make any shipments until the financial health of Rich's parent
becomes clearer.
   Greif supplies men's suits and sport coats under the Polo
University Club and Perry Ellis labels.
   ``They're hanging and waiting to go out,'' said Norman Fryman,
Greif's president and chief executive officer. He said Greif
already has manufactured hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of
goods for Rich's and other Campeau units.
   Campeau's suppliers are concerned about their prospects if a
filing under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code ensues.
   ``What I see happening, and what is going to make me angry along
with all (the) other customers owed money, is a Chapter 11 just
before they have to pay their debts,'' said Bud Konheim, president
of Nicole Miller Ltd., a dress maker. ``The perfect time is just
prior to Jan. 10.''
   The Jan. 10 date is when payment is due for the goods suppliers
shipped to Campeau in late November and December.
   Campeau announced Friday that Citibank had informed Campeau that
it might technically be in default on a loan agreement because it
cannot provide assurance about its solvency. Citibank, which is
Campeau's major lender, could call for full repayment on the $2.34
billion in loans it made for acquisition financing if Campeau can't
remedy the situation by Dec. 31.

<HEAD>To Kill Crop-Eating Slugs, Kill Quackgrass</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to quackgrass, a slimy,
crop-chewing slug is a dead duck, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   Weed scientist Roger D. Hagin of the department's Agricultural
Research Service said that when quackgrass is killed, it releases a
compound into the soil that acts as a nerve poison against slugs.
   ``The poison is highly specific to slugs,'' he said. ``It has
been tested with no ill effects on three species of freshwater
snails, as well as mammals in general.''
   Hagin, who works at the agency's Plant Protection Research Unit
in Ithaca, N.Y., has isolated and synthesized the quackgrass
compound. A patent on the material is in the works, which could
clear the way for commercial development of a new lethal bait for
slugs.
   Commercial poisons are available now to kill slugs, but those
also are toxic to birds and animals, he said. The quackgrass
treatment could be applied at much lower rates and at less cost.
   Hagin field-tested the compound for two years in snapbeans,
alfalfa and other crops. He said the snapbean yields were nearly
doubled as a result of reduced slug damage.
   Quackgrass is widespread and competes strongly for fertilizer
and water in crops such as corn, soybeans and forages, Hagin said.
   Slugs are especially troublesome in humid areas and have taken a
heavy toll of West Coast strawberry fields and citrus orchards.
Hagin said they also interfere with corn production on the East
Coast.
   Further, slugs are a serious problem in no-till or
minimum-tillage farming, where the soil is not cultivated heavily.
   ``We're currently looking at the possibility of using the slug
poison compound as a seed treatment in minimum-tillage
situations,'' Hagin said. ``We might be able to get the crop plants
to take this material up as a defense against slug attacks.''
   Hagin accidentally discovered the quackgrass connection in 1981
after he had used herbicides to get rid of weeds before he planted
no-till corn on land where red clover had been raised.
   ``When the corn was about six inches tall, I noticed that slugs
were attacking it heavily,'' he said. ``But there were little
islands in the field where quackgrass had been growing with the
clover, and in those areas the slugs weren't attacking the corn at
all.''
   Quackgrass is known to leave two ``allelopathic'' chemical
compounds behind in the soil that inhibit the growth of certain
other plants. But those are different from the compound that kills
the slugs, Hagin said.

<HEAD>One Year Later, Some Canadians Grump Over Free Trade Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The furor that marked approval of the free trade
agreement with the United States has subsided, but critics in
Canada blame the year-old pact for bad economic news ranging from
unemployment to a big rise in imports.
   The agreement's supporters, just as adamantly, credit it with
operating smoothly and preparing the way for growth.
   The pact that took effect on Jan. 1, 1989, phases out over a
10-year period virtually all remaining tariffs in the world's
largest trading partnership. Most analysts agree that no method has
been devised to measure its early effects accurately.
   ``I think the concrete ways to measure it are difficult at this
point,'' said Jim deWilde, a professor at the University of Western
Ontario's business school. ``It's an adjustment in the way Canada
and the United States conduct a very large trading relationship.''
   ``It's going to be very difficult to calculate the precise
impact,'' economist Alan Rugman of the University of Toronto said.
   The value of two-way trade in goods grew dramatically during the
past decade, more than doubling from $76.85 billion in 1980 to
$153.02 billion in 1988, U.S. Commerce Department figures show.
   In all of those years, the United States bought more goods from
Canada than the Canadians bought in return, netting Canada a trade
surplus that helped restrain inflation and keep people working.
   Canada's Parliament approved the pact only after a heated
election campaign dominated by the trade debate returned Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party for a
second consecutive majority government.
   Mulroney argued that the agreement he had signed with
then-President Reagan would ensure Canada's access to the vastly
larger U.S. market at a time when protectionism was increasing
around the world.
   His opponents insisted the pact was unnecessary because 80
percent of U.S.-Canadian trade already was tariff-free. By lowering
the remaining barriers, the opponents argued, Canada would be
swamped culturally and economically by its more populous, powerful
southern neighbor.
   The argument lingers on.
   ``The fact is, when choices have to be made between saving
Canadian and American jobs, multinational firms sacrifice Canadian
jobs every time,'' John Turner, leader of the opposition Liberal
Party, told Parliament in early December following a flurry of
announcements about plant closings and layoffs.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson replied that any job losses are
unfortunate, ``but we have to realize we have a dynamic economy.
There are jobs that are being created every day, there are jobs
being lost every day.''
   The Canadian Labor Congress, a key opponent of the trade
agreement, has a list of 70,000 jobs lost in plant closings and
layoffs this year, by such companies as Gerber, General Electric
and Burlington Industries.
   Maude Barlow, head of the nationalistic Council of Canadians
that opposes the agreement, said the trends sending jobs to U.S.
over Canadian operations are clear even if not every layoff can be
traced directly to free trade.
   A survey taken for the national news weekly Maclean's at yearend
found that 52 percent of Canadians think the free trade agreement
is a bad idea, up from 32 percent a year ago. But, while 42 percent
of Canadians a year ago believed that free trade was the most
important issue facing the country, only 7 percent believe that now.
   The persistent criticism of the trade agreement parallels
evidence of an economic slowdown in Canada, with some warnings of
an imminent recession.
   Canada's healthy trade balance, historically considered a sign
of economic strength, showed a monthly deficit in October, the
first time that has happened in more than 13 years.
   Federal officials attributed the $362 million shortfall partly
to the high value of the Canadian dollar, which makes imports
cheaper and Canadian goods more expensive. Government critics
blamed the trade agreement.
   ``Is this what the prime minister meant when he said that his
trade deal would make our trade more and more secure?'' Turner
asked.
   Mulroney replied that the deficit reflected increased imports of
capital goods and machinery, which he said will help Canada
restructure its industries and exploit the free trade pact more
effectively.
   The agreement not only phases out tariffs but also creates new
ways to settle trade disputes and eases investment and the movement
of employees between the two countries.
   Canada and the United States agreed recently that the pact was
working well enough to merit acceleration of tariff cuts on an
additional $6 billion worth of trade starting April 1.
   ``Overall, we're extremely satisfied,'' Trade Minister John
Crosbie said Nov. 30 after the second meeting of the Free Trade
Commission created by the pact.
   ``It's remarkable how well it is working and what few disputes
we have,'' U.S. trade representative Carla Hills told reporters at
the meeting in Ottawa.
   Although the impact of the trade agreement may be difficult to
measure, companies now refer to it regularly in their planning.
   ``It's accelerated the need for Canadian corporate strategists
to think about the performance of their companies in a larger
context,'' said deWilde, of the Western Ontario business school in
London, Ontario.
   Arthur Church, president of Champion Road Machinery Ltd., said
his company has started to examine Japanese management techniques
and take other steps to increase productivity as his larger U.S.
competitors discover the Canadian market.
   ``I truly believe that before free trade many of our American
competitors did not know where Canada was,'' he said at a forum for
exporters. ``We can complain, or we can do something about it.''

   The dollar drifted mostly lower in very thin
pre-holiday trading Wednesday, dipping to what traders said was its
lowest level against the West German mark since the spring of 1988.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, declined sharply in the United States
and overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion
for current delivery settled at $400.80 a troy ounce, down $6 from
Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York, quoted a late bid for
gold at $400.55 an ounce, off $6.45.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained pressured by the
continued strength of the West German mark and from expectations
that U.S. interest rates will decline further because of weakness
in the American economy.
   The mark has been on the rise for several weeks amid rapid
political and economic reforms in Eastern Europe. Many economists
predict West Germany's economy will be bolstered as more Eastern
European countries, including neighboring East Germany, open their
doors to the West.
   In late New York trading, the dollar closed at 1.6895 West
German marks, down from 1.7090 Tuesday.
   Gabriele Schmitt, a currency trader with the Bank of New York,
said that was the weakest close this year and the lowest level
since April 1988.
   Although sentiment toward the dollar remains bullish, dealers
said they expect trading to remain very light in the two days
before the long New Year's holiday weekend.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to 142.10 Japanese yen from 142.37 yen
Tuesday. It traded at 142.05 yen in London, and at 142.00 yen in
New York, up from 141.845 yen Tuesday.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound. In London,
sterling rose to $1.6255 from $1.6205 late Friday. Later, in New
York, it fetched $1.6275, up from $1.6265 Tuesday.
   Most European financial markets were closed on Monday and
Tuesday for the Christmas holiday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
quotes, included: 1.5295 Swiss francs, down from 1.54525; 5.7600
French francs, down from 5.8020; 1.15735 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.6005; and 1,263.75 Italian lire, down from 1,272.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.6895 West
German marks, down from 1.7090; 1.5355 Swiss francs, down from
1.5475; 5.7760 French francs, down from 5.8385; 1.9080 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9330; 1,266.00 Italian lire, down from
1,277.75; 1.1587 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1585.
   Gold closed in London at a late bid price of $406.25 an ounce,
down from $412.25 Friday. It fell in Zurich to $406 an ounce from
$413.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $408.49 an ounce, down $5.45 from
Tuesday.
   Silver prices also slipped. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.240 a troy ounce, down from
$5.512. Silver fell in London to $5.41 an ounce from $5.58 bid
Friday.

<HEAD>State Investigates Southern Bell Pay Phone Commissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's attorney general said
Wednesday the state is investigating whether Southern Bell
underpaid commissions for pay telephone use to governments in
several Southeastern states.
   Attorney General Bob Butterworth said the delinquent commissions
could total in the millions of dollars but determining the exact
amount has been hampered by the telephone company's inability to
provide records.
   The commissions were to have been paid over two years starting
in August 1986. Butterworth said Atlanta-based Southern Bell knew
of the problem in February 1987, but did nothing until a report in
The Miami Herald last month.
   ``Computer mistakes do happen,'' he said. ``It is troubling,
however, that Southern Bell knew about this problem for more than
2{ years, yet apparently made little effort to reimburse its
short-changed government customers.''
   Southern Bell contracts with government agencies to put pay
phones in buildings and then pays a percentage based on usage.
   Southern Bell did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
Officials previously have denied any wrongdoing and said the
mistake was caused by a computer error.
   Butterworth said the failure to make back-payments promptly
could violate the state's grand theft law.
   Butterworth said he began sending letters Wednesday to federal,
state and local agencies advising them not to accept restitution
from Southern Bell until his office accounts for the delinquent
commissions.
   ``As soon as we can determine what appears to be owed, we will
advise you,'' Butterworth said in one letter. ``You may well be
entitled to to a claim exceeding the contract amount plus
interest.''
   Butterworth said Southern Bell may owe commissions to agencies
in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
   In a letter last week to Southern Bell President B. Franklin
Skinner, Butterworth said key documents regarding the commissions
were lost or destroyed and that the company initially said it could
not replace them. Now, however, Southern Bell is ``reconstructing''
those records, he said.
   Butterworth asked Skinner to ensure that Southern Bell does not
attempt to pay restitution and that whatever amount the utility
believes it owes be placed in an interest-bearing trust account
until the investigation ends.
   The Herald reported that Southern Bell had underpaid Broward
County agencies more than $150,000 in commissions. The newspaper
quoted a former utility manager as saying the company knew the
revenue reports were wrong.

   The stock market gained ground in a quiet
session Wednesday, bidding again to mount a yearend rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 2.13 on Tuesday,
climbed 15.14 to 2,724.40.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
928 up, 560 down and 476 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 133.73 million
shares, up from 77.61 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 176.89 million shares.
   Analysts found little in the economic news to stir the market
out of its recent lethargy. Interest rates were narrowly mixed in
the credit markets.
   But traders still appeared to be hopeful that stocks might
gather strength in early 1990, once yearend maneuvering by
investors for tax and portfolio reporting purposes is out of the
way.
   Worries persist on Wall Street that the economy will encounter
rocky going in the early stages of the new year.
   However, some analysts are predicting a relatively quick
recovery in business activity, given encouragement from a continued
easing of the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   Germany Fund jumped 2] to 17\ in active trading as the West

   At an age when most men would consider waking
up in the morning an accomplishment, Isaac A. Long gets his kicks
by creating headlines in financial publications around the world.
   The 90-year-old chairman emeritus of Southwest Bank of St. Louis
has made a career out of taking the lead in cutting the prime
lending rate and watching other banks follow in his tracks.
   Until Nov. 8, Long was batting .900 as a bellwether. But other
banks didn't match him that time and he became news because
Southwest had to backtrack three weeks later and readjust its prime
from 10 percent to 10.5 percent.
   Considering that it was the first time in at least 10 years that
he has had to retreat, Long took it well.
   ``We're still batting about .875,'' he said. ``That's still a
pretty good average.''
   In fact, Long said, the move was well worth it.
   ``What we really did was give our commercial customers a
Christmas bonus a little early,'' he said. ``We feel it was an
excellent investment from an advertising and public relations
standpoint.''
   The prime rate is important because it is used by many banks as
a basis for determining rates on a wide range of other loans,
including highly popular home-equity loans. A drop in the prime
would be followed by lower interest rates for loans to consumers
and small businesses.
   Speculation has persisted in the past few weeks that banks would
cut the prime rate because their own borrowing costs have declined,
a result of recent credit-easing moves by the Federal Reserve, the
nation's central bank, to forestall an economic downturn. As of
this past week, however, neither Long's bank nor any other appeared
willing to lower the prime rate.
   Using the year 1989 as an example of Long's influence on the
banking industry, the prime rate rested at 11.5 percent until
Friday, June 2.
   That's when Long announced Southwest was dropping its prime to
11 percent. On Monday, the next work day, all the major banks in
the country followed.
   On Friday, July 7, Long again rattled the industry's chains and
dropped his prime to 10.5 percent. The following Monday, only New
York's Chase Manhattan Bank followed Southwest's lead. It wasn't
until the 29th that Bank of America joined them and it was two more
days before the other big banks fell into step.
   Then came Nov. 8 and the cut that separated Southwest from the
rest of the pack.
   ``I.A. Long sort of hung himself out there to dry,'' said Ray
Worseck, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Son, Inc. a St. Louis
investment firm. ``I think the optimists got a little bit ahead of
themselves on this.''
   Long said one of the reasons he erred was the difficulty in
interpreting the behavior of the Federal Reserve, which
historically has acted with great secrecy in order to keep
financial markets stable.
   But the nation's central bank can send subtle signals about its
possible intentions, partly by control over the amount of money
available to lend. That control sometimes can be seen in the
behavior of the federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans
between banks.
   The rate had fallen below 8.5 percent in November, convincing
Long that the Fed was easing and it was time for a prime-rate cut.
Then the Fed appeared to suddenly reverse itself and the federal
funds rate rose to 8.75 on Nov. 28, forcing Long to backtrack.
   Some New York bankers may have enjoyed seeing Long with egg on
his face, but the old veteran says his aim, ever since he began his
rate crusade in the 1970s, has never been to make the big banks
look bad.
   ``Our policy, our ambition, is not to upstage the New York
banks,'' Long said. ``Our customers are very appreciative of the
fact that they don't have to wait for what banks in New York or
Chicago do. We make our own decisions.''
   Those decisions, he said, are based on lengthy analysis. He said
Southwest looks at trends rather than specific economic indicators
and he said he prefers to look at a six month period.
   Long broke into banking with the Royal Bank of Canada in New
York in 1920. After organizing the first branch bank in Virginia in
1922, he came to the National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis in 1927
and has never left the area.
   Named president of Southwest Bank in 1953, Long soon became its
largest stockholder. He often is called Col. Long, a title that has
stuck since he served a term as chairman of the St. Louis Police
Board.
   ``The bank has had the same location and the same name for 69
years,'' said Long. The bank's president, Edward C. Berra, and a
vice chairman, Fred A. Giacoma, were both hired by Long 29 years
ago. Long finally sold controlling interest in the institution in
1984.
   ``I think it's interesting that every time we get in the news
for being a national leader they call us `a small bank,''' Long
said. ``But if you look at the figres, we're in the top 5 percent
nationally and we're the largest independent bank in Missouri.''
   As chairman emeritus, Long isn't involved in day-to-day
operations of the bank, but he remains active and is considered an
authority on interest rates.
   ``I enjoy being here every day, keeping in touch with what's
going on,'' he said. ``It's really a lot of fun. I attribute my
longivity to having steady employment and my wife of 51 years.''
   As for retirement, Long said, ``I haven't given it a thought.
I'll worry about it when I get closer to retirement age.''

<HEAD>Inman Resigns as Westmark Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bobby Ray Inman, a former intelligence
chief, has resigned as head of Westmark Systems Inc., a defense
electronics contractor striving to pay for its $867 million buyout
of Tracor Holdings Inc.
   Westmark, whose sole holding is Tracor, said Inman ``initiated
the action after concluding that a transition in management would
facilitate the long-term financial and organizational decisions
which will be made at Westmark and Tracor.''
   Inman, who submitted his resignation Friday, said Tuesday he
made the decision nine days ago and ``the offers have begun to
flow.''
   He said his future probably would involve technology
investments, and that he will make a decision within six weeks.
   Earlier, Inman told Business Week magazine he planned to write a
book about leveraged buyouts, the practice of using cash flow or
asset sales to pay off money borrowed to buy a company.
   Inman has held the positions of chairman, president and chief
executive officer at both Tracor and Westmark since 1987.
   Austin-based Westmark announced that Elvis Mason, managing
partner of Mason Best Co., was elected chairman and chief executive
of Westmark on an interim basis.
   Mason Best is a Dallas-based merchant bank that founded Westmark
and is its largest shareholder. Mason served as chairman and chief
executive officer of Westmark during its formation and as a
director until two years ago.
   William Moyer has been named acting president and chief
executive officer of Tracor Holdings.
   Westmark was created in 1986 to purchase electronics companies,
and bought Tracor the following year.
   But the Tracor purchase was funded with high-yield bonds,
loading the company with high-cost debt. Declining margins have
further squeezed the company, which announced this month it was
seeking to sell off assets to pay down the debt. Westmark has a $16
million interest payment on the junk bonds due Feb. 1.
   Tracor, based in Austin, produces advanced defense electronics
systems. It also modifies commercial and government aircraft and
makes analytical instruments and electrical components.
   Inman joined Westmark in 1986. Prior to that, he was the first
director of Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp. in
Austin. MCC was the first government-approved consortium to help
the U.S. computer industry regain competitive advantages.
   Inman spent 30 years in the Navy, and rose to the rank of
admiral. He became director of naval intelligence in 1974, deputy
director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1976 and head of the
National Security Agency in 1977.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest carmaker, is
considering moving part of its station wagon production unit to the
United States, company officials said Wednesday.
   The officials said Toyota plans to start production of its Camry
wagon at its U.S. carmaking unit, Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A.
Inc., in Georgetown, Ky.
   Production at the U.S. plant is expected to start in early 1992,
but ``the schedule is subject to change depending on the market
situation,'' said a company official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``One of the reasons for moving the plant is that it is better
to manufacture where products will be sold,'' he said.
   Toyota currently sells Camry wagons only in overseas markets,
but it plans to import some of its U.S.-made wagons to Japan.
   Toyota has been selling about 1,600 Camry wagons a month in the
United States, but the official said they expect the demand to grow.

<HEAD>Heating Oil Up Sharply Again; Gold, Silver Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heating oil futures rose dramatically again Wednesday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange as speculation continued that supplies
would be tight amid continued cold weather.
   On other commodity markets, gold and silver prices plummeted as
investment buying dried up; orange juice futures were widely mixed;
livestock and meat were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mostly
lower.
   With temperatures slowly warming, oil traders focused on reports
of reduced production capacity at the Gulf of Mexico, where several
refineries were forced to shut down because of cold-weather damage
to equipment.
   The spot January heating-oil contract again led the gainers but
analysts said the market could become extremely volatile in the
next two sessions as the January contracts approach expiration on
Friday.
   ``The risk-to-reward at these price levels dictates a lot of
prudence and probably profit-taking,'' said William O'Neill,
research director with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Wholesale home heating oil settled .36 cent lower to 7.23 cent
higher with January at 99.71 cents a gallon, a six-year high.
   In other energy futures, West Texas Intermediate crude oil
finished .13 cent lower to .16 cent higher with February at $21.78
a barrel and unleaded gasoline was .09 cent lower to 2.45 cents
higher with January at 60.85 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures settled $6 to $7 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the spot contract for delivery in December at $400.80
a troy ounce, a five-week low.
   Silver futures fell 27.2 cents to 30.8 cents with spot December
settling at a seven-week low of $5.24 a troy ounce.
   Market analysts said the investment buying that drove precious
metals up sharply in October and November had dwindled with the
easing of international tensions.
   That development, compounded by typically thin holiday trading
conditions, caused a dearth of willing buyers when commercial
traders turned sellers early in Wednesday's session.
   ``There was nothing on the other side,'' said Stephen Platt, an
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``As the market
started breaking through chart support, you started seeing some
computer-fund selling, which was not easily absorbed by speculators
so the market pretty much got hammered.''
   The recent bull move had carried spot gold to almost $420 an
ounce and spot silver to nearly $5.90.
   Most orange juice futures soared the permitted daily limit of 5
cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange but the January
contract fell 2.95 cents to $1.5015 a pound amid profit-taking
after Tuesday's strong gains.
   Florida officials said they still could not estimate the damage
from the weekend freeze in the orange groves, but an increasing
number of experts said Brazilian imports and stockpiled Florida
juice should prevent a sharp rise in cash prices.
   Cattle futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid
profit-taking after steep gains on Tuesday. Hog futures rose and
pork belly futures fell in light trading ahead of the Agriculture
Department's monthly cold storage report.
   The report showed 68.7 million pounds of bellies in cold storage
as of Dec. 1 compared with 39.8 million pounds a month earlier and
93.3 million pounds a year ago.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .48 cent lower with February at
77.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .43 cent lower
with January at 84.82 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .35 cent
higher with February at 49.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .57 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February at 49.20 cents
a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade, led by a drop in the soybean market that
analysts attributed mainly to technical factors.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to 3} cents lower with March at
$4.06\ a bushel; corn was unchanged to { cent higher with March at
$2.39 a bushel; oats were { cent lower to { cent lower with March
at $1.52{ a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 4 cents lower with
January at $5.64{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Tiny Film Production Company Settles Suit Against Kodak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLASTONBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small film company that makes videos
of the nation's top tourist attractions said Wednesday it had
settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit against a division of
photography giant Eastman Kodak Co.
   J.R. Johnson, a co-founder VideoTours, said the company had
agreed to drop its lawsuit against Kodak Programs Inc., Kodak's
home video division, in exchange for an undisclosed cash settlement.
   The agreement also calls for Kodak to cease marketing
VideoTours' tapes and pay certain royalties due its clients,
Johnson said.
   Kodak spokesman Paul Allen declined to discuss specifics of the
settlement, but said it meant the affiliation between the two
companies _ one with revenues of $17 billion, the other with sales
of $1 million _ was over.
   Glastonbury-based VideoTours produces videos of top tourist
attractions so viewers can ``visit'' the sites without leaving
their living rooms.
   VideoTours filed suit in U.S. District Court in Hartford in
October, alleging breach of contract in its distribution deal with
Kodak. The lawsuit sought more than $50,000 in damages.
   VideoTours charged that Kodak failed to help VideoTours market
and promote videos already produced and assist in financing
additional productions.
   It also charged that Kodak failed to pay royalties to VideoTours
clients, many of whom are non-profit institutions, monitor on-site
sales, refill inventories and maintain displays with zoos,
aquariums and museums where the tapes are sold.
   VideoTours, founded in 1986, has produced 13 videos featuring
the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Old Sturbridge Village and Mystic
Seaport in Connecticut and other sites.

<HEAD>Great Northern Claims Takeover Would Prevent Needed Expenditures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. said
Wednesday in federal court that needed capital investments at its
Maine operations could not be made and that anti-competitive
practices would result if Georgia-Pacific Corp. is successful in
its $3.8 billion takeover attempt.
   The testimony came in the opening day of a hearing on Great
Northern's request for an injunction to block the unfriendly
takeover. Great Northern claims antitrust laws would be violated if
the two forest products companies merged.
   U.S. District Judge Warren W. Eginton set aside 14 days for the
hearing.
   The chairman of Great Northern, William R. Laidig, testified
about the Norwalk-based company's plans for $2.5 billion in capital
investments and acquisitions in Maine over the next five years.
   Laidig, during questioning by the company's attorney, said
Georgia-Pacific would be so laden with debt if it were successful
in the takeover that it could not possibly carry out the capital
plans.
   The takeover would result in anti-competitive practices in
southern pulpwood markets and in the national market for paper used
in personal bank checks, Great Northern also asserted.
   Georgia-Pacific's chief executive officer, T. Marshall Hahn,
said outside the courtroom that the projected cash flow after a
merger of the two companies would be adequate ``even in a financial
crisis'' to finance needed capital expenditures.
   ``It's an old-fashioned combination of two strong industrial
companies,'' Hahn said, calling Great Northern's claims
``transparent nonsense.''
   ``There is no junk debt involved,'' he said.
   Great Northern has calculated the resulting debt would total
$4.5 billion.
   Attorneys for Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific said a merger would
increase efficiency.
   As of Friday, 73.4 percent of Great Northern stockholders
tendered their shares under Georgia-Pacific's $63-a-share offer,
Stapleton said.
   The takeover battle is also being waged in Maine, where Great
Northern is incorporated. Georgia-Pacific is challenging
anti-takeover provisions in Great Northern's bylaws, as well as
Maine's corporate takeover law, which forces hostile suitors to
wait five years before merging with a targeted company.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge in Chevron Corp.'s suit
over Pennzoil Co.'s alleged clandestine takeover attempt lifted
restrictions Wednesday on Pennzoil's ability to file countersuits
in other courts.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson refused to extend an order
imposed by another federal judge Dec. 7 that prohibited Pennzoil
from suing anywhere on related issues without approval of the San
Francisco federal court.
   Henderson noted that Pennzoil had denied any intention of suing,
said Chevron's claims to the contrary were based on speculation,
and added that the local court had the power to prevent
inconsistent rulings even if other suits were filed elsewhere.
   The decision was a skirmish in Chevron's battle to force
Pennzoil to sell its newly acquired $2.1 billion, 8.8 percent share
of Chevron's stock and prohibit it from buying more stock without
court approval.
   San Francisco-based Chevron also is seeking to validate the
anti-takeover measures its directors took around the time of the
disclosure of Pennzoil's purchases three weeks ago.
   Pennzoil, based in Houston, said it was using $2.1 billion of
its $2.6 billion net proceeds from a settlement of its suit with
Texaco as a long-term investment in Chevron for tax purposes.
Pennzoil said it might invest the other $500 million in Chevron
stock but denied any intention of a takeover of the nation's
fourth-largest oil company.
   But Chevron, citing Pennzoil's past attempts to acquire oil
property, contended the rival firm intended a hostile merger or a
forced restructuring.
   Chevron's suit accuses Pennzoil of violating federal laws
requiring advance notice and a 30-day waiting period before major
stock purchases by anyone but a passive long-term investor.
   Pennzoil, saying Chevron's suit is based on unfounded
suspicions, has asked Henderson to dismiss the case. A ruling is
pending.
   Wednesday's decision involved an order Chevron obtained Dec. 7
from Chief U.S. District Judge William Ingram forbidding suits by
Pennzoil without approval from the local court.
   Chevron said Pennzoil would inevitably sue to challenge the
restrictions on takeovers, and argued that restrictions were needed
to avoid inconsistent decisions.

<HEAD>Report That Bids Are Low Causes Hilton Stock Price To Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. stock plunged
Wednesday on a report that offers for the hotel-casino company are
in the $90 range instead of the $120 some analysts had believed
Hilton would fetch.
   Hilton, which was put up for sale last summer after the
settlement of a dispute over the estate of founder Conrad Hilton,
fell $6.87{ to close at $82.87{ a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The Wall Street Journal reported that JMB Realty Corp., a
Chicago-based pension fund manager, had offered about $90 a share
for Hilton, which would bring the total offer to $4.3 billion.
Hilton general counsel William Lebo declined to comment on the
report.
   Another of the bidders for Hilton is Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray
Co., billionaire investor Marvin Davis' Denver-based real estate
vehicle. The Journal reported that Miller-Klutznick was bidding
about the market price for the stock, which was about $90 before
the Journal report Wednesday.
   Calls to Miller-Klutznick and JMB were not returned.
   Hilton stock was trading at $63 per share when Conrad Hilton's
son, Barron Hilton, settled the estate dispute in May.
   In August, Hilton stock soared to $112 a share on reports that
the company would consider at least two formal buyout bids. At that
time, some analysts were estimating that shareholders were likely
to get $120 per share if Hilton was sold and possibly as much as
$140.
   But the collapse of the junk bond market and fears of a
recession have made it much harder to complete takeovers recently,
and the stock price has gradually fallen as no deal was announced.
   Hilton had its best year ever in 1987, when profits rose 43
percent and earnings were $5.59 per share. Earnings fell to $2.72
per share last year and have remained relatively flat this year,
rising 2 percent in the July-September quarter to $28.1 million, or
57 cents a share.
