   Russell Gill had to squeeze it in between
Mahler's Ninth and ``The Damnation of Faust,'' but the Columbus
Symphony musician still managed to make 50 trips up central Ohio's
tallest building.
   ``He climbed 41,751 stairs. That's one more than last year,''
said Gill's wife, Gail, after he completed his climbs.
   The string bass player's effort at the 40-story James Rhodes
State Office Tower raised about $6,000 for the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, said event organizers.
   The fund-raiser, in its eighth year, fell on one of the
37-year-old musician's busier weekends.
   Gill's weekend schedule included a Saturday night concert
featuring Gustav Mahler's Ninth Symphony and a Sunday afternoon
rehearsal for Hector Berlioz' ``Faust.'' So he took a half-hour nap
after the concert and started the 629-foot ascents at 2 a.m. Sunday,
finishing by about 1 p.m., his wife said.
   ``That's dedication,'' said Ann Pfau, executive director of
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's central Ohio chapter. The rest of the
event's approximately 80 participants showed up at 10 a.m., she
said. They quit about 3:30 p.m.
   Last year's climb raised about $12,000 for the foundation, she
said. This year's goal was $15,000. Each participant in the climb
had sponsors who pledged donations to the charity.
   Participants who finished their climbs were treated to free leg
massages.

   A plan to race 40,000 rubber ducks down the
White River to raise money for a food bank has been sunk by concerns
about Indiana's gambling laws.
   The state attorney general's office and private attorneys advised
organizers the event would be considered an illegal lottery, but
organizers hope state lawmakers will pass legislation enabling the
Great American Rubber Duck Race, originally scheduled for April, to
go off by September.
   Gleaner's Food Bank Inc. of Indiana has intended to sell numbered
ducks for $10 each and raise $400,000 for transporting food across
the state. The first 15 ducks across the finish line would have
brought prizes.
   J. Bradford Senden, an organizer, said each $10 donation would
have moved 65 pounds of food through the system serving 825 agencies
in Indiana.
   ``A rubber duck race is the sort of fun, harmless, family event
that can be a tremendous benefit to a charity's serious,
people-helping agenda,'' Senden said in announcing the postponement.
``It was simply an effort to make sure smaller agencies throughout
the state get food with no transportation costs.''
   With lottery proposals now circulating in the Statehouse, Senden
said he was confident provisions would be made for events like the
rubber duck race.

   Colleges have tried many tactics to
attract capable minority students and make them feel welcome:
offered special scholarships, started support groups, hired
counselors, overlooked low test scores.
   At Gettysburg College, they're about to try genealogy.
   Starting in March, this Lutheran-affiliated liberal arts school
where just 40 of 1,850 students are black is opening an
``intercultural resource center'' where all students, but especially
African-Americans, can learn how to research their family roots.
   The two-story wood-frame center, when it is officially dedicated
at a March 18 ceremony, will coordinate a campus-wide effort to help
minority students develop self-awareness and confidence.
   The ultimate aim: to break down the sense of isolation blacks
often feel on this campus, help them be part of the mainstream and
eventually use their self-awareness to strive for leadership roles.
   Already, the center's bookshelves are packed with state census
records from 40 states dating back to the early 1800s. Thick brown
volumes contain ship passenger and immigration lists dating back to
the 18th century. There are also genealogy guides for Germans,
Italians, American Indians, Danes, Finns, Russians and English.
   ``I don't know that much about myself, and I want to know,'' said
Dawn Hadnott, a 17-year-old freshman from Teaneck, N.J., one of
several black students who told a visitor they were eager to get
started on genealogical studies. ``I think I have some Indian in me:
my great-grandmother Moan.''
   ``I think there's a lack of pride in the black community,'' said
Troy Datcher, a 20-year-old junior who is president of the Black
Student Union. ``I think it can be rebuilt with a program like this.
Maybe you can find out that you were related to someone famous.''
   At a time of racial tension on many other campuses, Gettysburg's
aim is to foster toleration through appreciation and knowledge of
cultural diversity, says Harry Bradshaw Matthews, the school's
37-year-old ``dean of intercultural advancement.''
   If black students know more about themselves, the reasoning goes,
they will be better prepared to fit into a college environment as
minorities, and more inclined to stay the full four years. They
might also be inclined to spread the word to their friends.
   The new Gettysburg center is unusual on several counts. Probably
no other school so small has focused such attention on
African-American genealogy, according to James Dent Walker, a
founder of the Washington-based Afro-American Historical and
Genealogical Society. The much larger Temple University in
Philadelphia houses the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American collection
which contains over 40,000 items.
   Second, Gettysburg pointedly chose not to name it an
``Afro-American Center'' or ``Black Student Center,'' as many
colleges have. The idea was to have a place on campus celebrating
all cultures.
   Finally, Gettysburg may be the first college to view genealogy as
a vehicle for recruiting and retaining minority students.
   That strategy may lack the glitz or quick-fix appeal of setting
numerical minority recruitment goals or quotas as other colleges
have, but Gettysburg never did.
   But Matthews says he has already used his approach successfully
as a minority counselor at two other predominantly white campuses,
Northern Michigan University and the affiliated Hobart and William
Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y.
   Now he confidently predicts: ``Gettysburg will end up with a name
across the United States, as a place for the advancement of
African-American and other minority students.''
   Yet Gettysburg seems hardly the most fertile place for an
innovative approach to black student recruitment, despite its
location adjacent to the Civil War battlefield where Abraham Lincoln
delivered his address that became an anthem in the history of race
relations.
   College guides such as the ``Yale Insider's Guide'' have
described Gettysburg's students as ``all alike,'' and ``white and
upper middle-class.''
   The descriptions are ``all too true,'' admits president Charles
Glassick.
   Black students here say that while seldom the target of overt
racism, they often feel shunned and isolated.
   ``Most students here never interacted with blacks, and at
Gettysburg it's possible to avoid that,'' said Michael Warren, a
22-year-old senior majoring in African-American studies.
   ``We were frankly interested in enrolling more minority students.
So we brought in Harry Matthews,'' said Glassick.
   Well under 100 blacks were applying to Gettysburg each year, and
the retention rate of those who attend had been ``abominable,'' said
Glassick. The rate was 46 percent in the 1970s, though that has
recently improved to around 73 percent.
   Even with warm backing by the president and trustees, Matthews'
arrival at Gettysburg in 1985 was not greeted with universal joy.
   ``Did I feel welcome? Hell, no. It was a challenge,'' he told a
visitor.
   ``Some in the faculty and administration were looking for a more
radical guy,'' he said. Some called the conservatively-dressed,
soft-spoken Matthews an ``Uncle Tom.'' Others wondered aloud why
Matthews and his ideas were worth scarce college dollars when they
seemed geared to so few students.
   But when the college spent $450,000 to purchase the building that
eventually housed the center, it became clear to all that the
center, and Matthews, were here to stay.
   Matthews says he faced the same jolting transition that other
black college students often find so trying. He grew up in
Roosevelt, Long Island, a New York suburb where the public schools
are mostly black. He wanted to attend historically black Fisk
University but wound up at the mostly white State University of New
York at Oneonta where financial aid was more generous.
   In 1977, the popularity of ``Roots,'' the book and television
miniseries by Alex Haley, sparked Matthews' passion for genealogy.
``When ``Roots'' came out, I made a pledge to trace my family before
I had children,'' he said, a vow he has kept.
   Eleven years of subsequent research led him to discover ancestors
dating back to the American Revolution. He believes his oldest
ancestor was a freedman known as Isaac the African who served in the
3rd Regiment of South Carolina.
   The resource center will only be the starting point for such
research, however. Students wanting to delve deeply into their past
will still have to go to the National Archives in Washington, talk
to relatives, check state and county records of births, retirement
records, marriage certificates and property deeds, just as any
genealogist would. Eventually, Matthews hopes, the center will
sponsor trips to archives in Washington and elsewhere.
   Genealogy is especially formidable for blacks. Census data are
only helpful back to 1870. It's almost impossible for most blacks to
discover their ancestral ``Kunta Kinte,'' the character in ``Roots''
captured in Africa and brought to America on a slave ship.
   What may be possible, though difficult, is to trace lineage
before 1870 by studying white slaveholding families.
   With black genealogy, said Matthews, ``you just can't get around
white folks. It's the only way.''

   Three times this decade, police killings of unarmed
blacks have triggered riots here, but no officer has ever been
convicted in those deaths and many blacks lack faith in law
enforcement's ability to police itself.
   ``People are willing to endure unemployment and poor housing, but
they cannot endure being brutalized and shot for no reason,'' said
Aleem Fakir, an organizer for People United to Lead the Struggle for
Equality.
   In the latest disturbance, three nights of violence followed the
Jan. 16 shooting of black motorcyclist Clement Lloyd by Miami police
Officer William Lozano. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, died of
injuries from the ensuing crash.
   In the riots that followed, one man was killed, 13 buildings were
burned and many businesses were looted.
   A week after the shooting, the Colombian-born Lozano was arrested
and charged with two counts of manslaughter.
   The speed with which he was charged was astonishing compared with
previous cases _ so much so that Lozano's attorney, along with a
Colombian business group and the local police union president,
accused prosecutors of acting with unseemly haste to quiet the black
community.
   ``We did not look at any kind of pacification, satisfaction,''
said Miami Police Chief Perry Anderson, who is black. ``We looked at
what we had to do as professional law enforcement investigators.''
   To many blacks, however, the relatively mild charges and the low
$10,000 bail for Lozano seem like the familiar beginning of a
recurring tragedy.
   Metro-Dade officers were acquitted in May 1980 of the beating
death the previous December of black insurance agent Arthur
McDuffie, sparking an uprising in which 18 people died. In March
1984, a Hispanic Miami policeman was acquitted of killing Nevell
Johnson in a video arcade in December 1982. His death also caused
disturbances, although police moved quickly to stem protests after
the verdict.
   ``I just want to know why policemen have so many protection
shields around them,'' said the Rev. Richard Barry, who heads a
special review board empaneled by the city to investigate the latest
case. ``They have the Fraternal Order of Police, the policeman's
bill of rights _ and if they have that much protection, how do you
get to them?''
   Barry's committee, set up with much fanfare just as the riots
subsided, discovered at its first meeting that although the City
Commission gave it subpoena power, state law and competing criminal
investigations prevented key witnesses from testifying.
   Most investigations of police misconduct proceed at a glacial
pace.
   Two cases that didn't involve black victims show the more
leisurely pace of police abuse investigations.
   One month before Lloyd was shot in Miami's black Overtown
section, six members of Miami's elite street narcotics squad were
relieved of duty after allegedly beating an unarmed man to death in
his home. That investigation continues, and no one has been charged.
   A month before that, a Miami officer's gun went off during a
traffic stop, killing the motorist. No resolution has been reached
in that case, either.
   While the police internal security division handles routine
complaints, State Attorney Janet Reno's office has responsibility
for cases that may involve criminal charges.
   Her policy, intended to de-politicize sensitive cases, tends to
drag out the process, many blacks say. It requires that charges
against an officer be filed only after presentation of evidence in a
special hearing before a judge.
   ``If there is a question mark, we take it to an inquest,'' she
said.
   Critics say there always seem to be question marks when police
are involved.
   ``The police get together and corroborate each other's stories
and grill independent witnesses, looking for the smallest
inconsistency. It's a whitewash,'' said Fakir.
   He said some cases have stalled in the state attorney's office
for up to two years. In those cases where charges are brought, the
results have been less than satisfactory to blacks.
   Under a law popularly called the policeman's bill of rights,
officers in conservative, pro-police Florida can have representation
at all levels of disciplinary hearings, and complaints against them
must be held confidential for 60 days.
   Miami police say they investigate every complaint, as well as
generating their own investigations. Twenty-nine policeman have been
dismissed in the past four years, said Maj. Calvin Ross, newly
appointed head of the internal security office.
   Twenty-five officers are on leave with pay, routine procedure for
officers who use their firearms or are accused of serious
infractions. Most outstanding cases involve accusations of excessive
force or extreme acts of abuse, Ross said.
   In 1988, the department received 503 official complaints, each of
which can include more than one officer. Forty percent were deemed
unfounded, 24 percent substantiated and 36 percent ``inconclusive,''
which Ross admits is a frustrating category.
   ``If there's a one-on-one situation ... it's very difficult to
determine if the allegation occurred as the complainant said,'' Ross
said. ``That doesn't always sit just right with the complainant.''

<HEAD>French Government Losing Battle Against Franglais</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One recent morning, a newscast on France Inter radio
carried a story about ``le dumping'' by the Japanese on European
markets. The newspaper Liberation had a headline saying a top
politician was in ``les starting blocks'' for coming elections. In
the afternoon, ``un outsider'' won the day's top horse race.
   For years the French government has been battling the creeping
invasion of English without much success. Every time a new French
word is invented, such as ``logiciel'' for computer software, or
``cadreur'' for cameraman, six new Englishisms pop into the language.
   ``Couch potato'' has yet to gain currency in France, but it can't
be far away. An article in Le Monde about American television
introduced the term, calling such a person ``une patate de canape.''
   Most French profess to hate Franglais. On the other hand, most
use it. From morning to night, in newspapers, on radio and in
conversations, one is bombarded with ``le marketing,'' ``un
challenge,'' ``le sponsor,'' ``un leader,'' or ``un self-made-man.''
   Successive governments have made fighting Franglais their
official policy, creating a series of organizations to counter it.
   The most recent is the Commissariat General de la Langue
Francaise, which emerged in 1984 with the job of ``the defense of
the French language.'' The agency has just published the fifth
edition of its dictionary of official neologisms.
   The 2,393 neologisms _ new French words _ in the book are
mandatory for use in all ministries, official correspondence and
documents. But getting the public to accept them is another matter.
The folks at the Commissariat have no enforcement power; usage, not
policy, determines the success or failure of a word.
   ``It is out of the question that we play the role of policing the
language,'' said Bernard Billaud, the Commissariat's chief
wordmaster. ``Our role is to raise consciousness.''
   Many feel that the adoption of foreign words enriches a language,
within limits.
   ``All languages borrow words,'' Billaud said. ``It goes in the
other direction too. It is not so much a problem of borrowing words
as it is a matter of `naturalization' of the word borrowed and the
spirit of the word'' to make it really French.
   Fewer than 2,500 official neologisms is not a particularly
distinguished showing for nearly 20 years of work by the
Commissariat and its predecessors. But word-making is a long process.
   ``We have to consult specialists, find a word, perhaps consult
with the Academie Francaise,'' says Billaud, referring that oldest
of the guardians of the language (it was created by Richelieu in
1635). Billaud also acknowledges that there are ``serious gaps'' in
the dictionary.
   English-speakers are constantly amused by the struggle.
   The Commissariat has decreed that ``un bulldozer''
(bool-doe-zair) will now be a ``bouteur;'' journalists no longer get
``un scoop,'' but an ``exclusivite;'' pilots no longer work in ``un
cockpit,'' but in a ``habitacle.''
   Officialdom also has zapped ``zapping,'' the term used here for
TV-channel jumping. It has replaced it with ``saute-chaine,'' which
literally means ``channel-jump.''
   It has substituted ``tuiteur'' and ``boumeur'' for tweeters and
woofers on stereo sets. But try as it might, it has never been able
to get people to use ``Agetac'' _ the French version of the acronym
GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), and ``bande video
promotionelle'' just doesn't beat ``un clip.'' ``Un clip'' refers to
any promotional video, especially music videos.
   The word factory also has failed to come up with satisfactory
replacements for ``le look,'' when referring to image; ``le stress''
for day-to-day pressure, ``le sandwich'' or ``un blue-jean.''
   Perhaps more unusual are English words that, when absorbed into
French, lose their original meaning, such as ``le forcing,'' which
is to apply pressure, or ``un gadget,'' which can even be applied to
a government minister or program, meaning something just for show.
   The real irony is when English speakers steal a French term, like
``savoir faire,'' and the French retaliate by swiping ``know-how.''
The same can be said of ``rendezvous'' and ``meeting.''
   Worst of all are the sweatshirts and imitation American high
school jackets, where the fashion is to have English words written
on them, no matter how nonsensical, such as ``Athletic Sporting
Team,'' or ``Babie Bear Club.'' Then there's the sweatshirt that
says ``Scoop Entrainement Winter,'' which has no meaning at all and
is a spoof on the proliferation of English words on sweatshirts.
(``Entrainement'' is French for training.)
   Why this fascination with English?
   ``Much of the usage of English is snobbism,'' said Billaud,
speaking in French but slipping into an Englishism _ ``snobbisme,''
which has made its way into the French dictionary.
   ``It takes a psychoanalysis of the French people, who have always
been impressed by what comes from the outside,'' he added. ``It is
evidently a phenomenon resulting from the decline of France in the
world since 1939. France is conscious its influence has diminished.
It is trying to find compensation. English plays this role.
   ``The French want to be modern, and English is a sign of
modernity.''

   An anonymous caller who said he was a member
of an environmental extremist group claimed responsibility for a
fire Sunday that destroyed half of a rural warehouse used for
livestock auctions.
   Damage to the Dixon Livestock Auction Co. building, which
contained no animals, was estimated at $250,000, said Fire Chief
Rick Dorris. The early-morning fire was brought under control about
20 minutes after firefighters arrived.
   ``We've never been bothered by any radical groups before; we've
never received any threats,'' said Jim Schene of Stockton, whose
family rents the building and receives commissions for approximately
$10 million in livestock sold there each year.
   A man who identified himself only as a member of Earth First!
claimed responsibility for the fire in a telephone call to The
Associated Press bureau in San Francisco just before 11 a.m. The
caller did not give any reasons for the vandalism.
   Calls to other members of Earth First! were not returned Sunday.
   The unidentified caller also claimed responsibility for graffiti
at the California Cattlemen's Association, California Wool Growers
Association and the Agricultural Council of California near the
State Capitol in Sacramento. Dixon is about 20 miles west of
Sacramento.
   Spray-painted in green paint on the building housing the
associations were: ``Earth First! Agri-Bus kills,'' `Agribusiness
kills the (a drawing of the earth),'' and ``Earth First!''
   Written on the windows in what looked like shaving cream were
``Livestock Destroy,'' ``Stop Welfar,'' and ``Ran.''
   Earth First! is a radical environmental group founded by David
Foreman of Tuscon, Ariz. Militant members of the group, who often
call themselves the ``Monkeywrench Gang,'' have in the past promoted
tree spiking and destruction of equipment as ways to stop lumber
harvests.
   Tree spiking, which can damage and destroy saw blades and cause
major injuries to workers, has plagued the lumbermen along the West
Coast for several years.
   The Dixon Livestock Auction has not been involved in any recent
environmental disputes, according to local authorities.

   Wedding bells chimed at a homeless shelter in a
crumbling neighborhood Saturday as a homeless man and a volunteer
tied the knot at the sanctuary where they met last winter.
   ``It's a gorgeous time, it's a beautiful time,'' said Christine
Williams, who married Roosevelt Tucker. ``This is where we met. This
is our spot. This is where we fell in love.''
   The Inner Voice Shelter was filled with about 30 friends and
family of the couple as the Rev. Robert Johnson, who founded the
shelter, pronounced them husband and wife.
   The couple met when he was living on the street and she was
volunteering at the shelter, preparing meals for the men and women
who stop in to escape the cold winter winds that blow through the
empty lots and abandoned buildings that make up the bleak west side
neighborhood.
   Tucker, 34, now lives with his 32-year-old wife and her two
children in a nearby public housing project. She works as a school
crossing guard, but he is still unemployed and spends a good deal of
time at the shelter helping take care of the 150 to 200 people who
eat there daily.
   ``Things'll be better for them _ he looks pretty happy, so we're
happy,'' said Tucker's brother, Reginald.
   ``I thought he wasn't going to do it,'' added their beaming
mother, Irma Tucker. ``Now he's got a beautiful wife and he's
happy.''
   Roosevelt Tucker said the wedding was a good first step toward
getting back on his feet after being homeless off and on for seven
years. He said he planned to look for a job, but that until he finds
something he was happy to help out at the shelter that had given him
a chance.
   ``I enjoy doing it and I feel if I can bring myself up from the
street, I can help other people too,'' Tucker said.

   A heavily armed group has kidnapped an

police said Saturday.
   Michael Ray, 36, of Philadelphia, and Norman Echavarria, who
manufactures construction materials, were driving in a car Friday
when they were stopped by the group driving in several vehicles,
police said.
   Police believe Ray's abduction was accidental because apparently
the group's objective was to obtain a ransom for Echavarria.
   However, the businessman's family has not said if the kidnappers

   Ray arrived Jan. 17 in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city,

   A police officer was arrested for joining an anti-abortion
protest outside a clinic in Las Vegas Saturday and eight protesters
in New Jersey chained themselves together inside a clinic as more
than 350 people were arrested in five states.
   Bristol, Tenn.; Cranston, R.I.; and St. Petersburg, Fla. also
were sites of demonstrations by groups that have been protesting
regularly since last summer outside abortion clinics.
   Anti-abortion protests by apparently unrelated groups were held
in Columbia, S.C., and in Fort Wayne, Ind., where about 350
pro-choice activists rallied across the street from more than 5,000
anti-abortion demonstrators.
   In Las Vegas, traffic officer Chet Gallagher was assigned to duty
elsewhere but rode a police motorcycle to the protest site and
joined the group following roll call, said police Lt. Steve Gammell.
   ``One of the persons arrested was a Metro Police officer who was
on duty at the time and in uniform,'' said Gammell. ``He chose to
join the protest and became one of the protesters in an unlawful
assembly.
   ``He refused to remove himself and he was arrested like everyone
else,'' Gammell said. Police arrested a total of 91 people, he said.
   Gallagher defended his action in a statement following his
arrest, saying ``I have a sworn responsibility to protect human
life.''
   Gallagher was placed on paid leave until an internal
investigation determines whether disciplinary action should be taken.
   The protest was staged by the Southern Nevada Operation Rescue,
which is a chapter of the national anti-abortion group that has
moved to close down abortion clinics by blocking their entrances.
   In Woodbridge, N.J., eight anti-abortion protesters chained
together by their necks and legs inside a women's clinic later were
dragged out of the building by police who brought special equipment
from New York to break the shackles.
   Police arrested 17 others sitting or lying without chains inside
the Medical Care Center and charged them with trespassing for not
obeying an order to leave the grounds, said Woodbridge police Lt.
John Demarest.
   Many of the protesters were from Operation Rescue's New
Jersey-New York chapter. But none of the eight chained protesters
was from group.
   The last two people removed from the center were chained together
for 12 hours and were carried out at about 8:30 p.m., police said.
   Two of the eight were removed by local officials earlier in the
day. The remaining six had to be unchained by a special squad of New
York City police who used an electric grinder, police said.
   At Cranston, R.I., about 60 protesters blocked the doors of an
abortion clinic, closing the facility for 2{ hours before police
carried them away. An additional 150 demonstrators picketed on the
sidewalk in front of the Women's Medical Center.
   Thirty-two demonstrators in Bristol, Tenn., were arrested on
trespassing charges outside an abortion clinic, police said.
   At the clinic in Woodbridge, administrator Ellen Samuel said
business continued as usual during the protest and all the patients
with appointments showed up and were treated.
   She said the protesters violated a civil order barring them from
the property and that the center planned to pursue the matter in
court.
   ``They always protest here on Saturdays and they march
peacefully, and in the past they have respected the civil order,''
she said.
   In Columbia, S.C., nearly 2,000 people marched from the
University of South Carolina to the Statehouse on Saturday in a
delayed protest of the anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion.
   The rally was held six days after the anniversary of the decision
because several organizers had traveled to Washington a week ago to
participate in a national march.
   Police in St. Petersburg, Fla., arrested 150 abortion protesters
charged with trespassing Saturday morning during a sit-in at an
abortion clinic, said Tom Kovalcik, a police spokesman.

   Teamsters leaders Saturday rejected a
government proposal to settle a racketeering suit that alleges
mob-sponsored corruption in the nation's largest union and seeks to
oust its top officials, union sources said.
   The decision came at a hastily arranged meeting in Washington
called by Teamsters President William J. McCarthy, who on Friday
summoned the union's 16 vice presidents to discuss the settlement
offer, said one source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   ``We said no, we rejected it,'' said the source, who declined to
discuss the substance of the meeting.
   ``That's right, it was rejected,'' said another participant in
the meeting, who agreed to confirm the outcome of the meeting on the
condition he not be identified.
   Word of the decision came hours after one Teamster leader who
reportedly would have been forced out under the settlement announced
his resignation. A second union vice president also reportedly
resigned Saturday.
   ``It is with deep regret that I leave this International Union
and especially its membership,'' Robert Holmes, second vice
president of the Teamsters, said in a statement released by his
union office in Detroit.
   Holmes, in his resignation statement, said he wanted to spend
more time with his family.
   He also referred to a rift in the union leadership that has
existed since McCarthy edged out Teamsters Secretary-Treasurer
Weldon Mathis last year in the race to succeed the late Jackie
Presser as Teamsters president.
   The statement said the ``unwillingness'' of the union's governing
board ``to effectuate the reforms'' proposed by Holmes, Mathis and
others ``have made his participation on the general executive board
a continuing source of frustration.''
   The Cleveland Plain Dealer, quoting a union source, reported in
Sunday editions that John H. Cleveland of Washington also resigned
his post as a Teamsters vice president.
   Both Holmes and Cleveland were on the losing side last year when
McCarthy, then head of the Teamsters in New England, defeated
Mathis, Presser's hand-picked successor, in a 9-8 vote.
   The unprecedented racketeering suit brought by the Justice
Department maintains the 1.6-million member Teamsters union's
leadership is rife with mob-sponsored corruption.
   The case is scheduled for trial Feb. 27, but U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani, who is resigning, reportedly has proposed a
settlement that calls for a number of internal union reforms and the
resignations of several of the vice presidents.
   The Plain Dealer, which in its Saturday editions first reported
McCarthy's calling the meeting, quoted a Teamsters source as saying
Giuliani was ``hot to trot'' to settle the suit before leaving
office.
   Telephone calls to Teamsters headquarters in Washington on
Saturday went unanswered.
   A third source, speaking earlier Saturday to The Associated
Press, said, ``McCarthy called them together to talk it over, to see
how they feel about settling.'' That source said he had no details
of the proposed settlement and did not know whether all 16 vice
presidents traveled to Washington for the meeting.
   The Plain Dealer said the proposal calls for direct elections of
top Teamsters officials, with an independent panel named to oversee
the process. The officials now are elected at a convention of
delegates, a process law enforcement officials allege has been
influenced at times by organized crime leaders.
   The Los Angeles Times reported last week that Giuliani, as part
of a proposed settlement, was demanding the resignations of five of
the 16 international vice presidents. The newspaper identified
Holmes as one of the five and said the other four are Harold
Friedman of Cleveland, Joseph Trerotola of New York, Joseph Morgan
of Hallandale, Fla., and Ted R. Cozza of Pittsburgh.
   Spokeswoman Deborah Corley said Giuliani's office would neither
confirm nor deny reports of a proposed settlement and had no further
comment on the case.
   In an interview published this month in the union's newsletter,
The International Teamster, McCarthy predicted the union would win
the case.
   ``Every single member of the general executive board is committed
to fighting the insulting accusations and personal attacks that have
been leveled against us,'' McCarthy was quoted as saying. ``I know
we're going to win this because we're right and right will triumph
in the end.''
   The suit was filed seven months ago under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It asks that the court
oust the Teamsters leadership and place the union under court
trusteeship.
   More than two dozen reputed organized crime figures were named as
defendants in addition to the union, then-President Presser, 16
Teamsters vice presidents and a former vice president. Two of the
vice presidents named in the suit have since resigned. McCarthy was
third vice president when the suit was filed.
   The suit contends that the alleged mob figures were aided and
abetted by Teamsters officials, including McCarthy, in controlling
activities of the union through racketeering. It lists convictions
in Teamster-related crimes dating back more than 25 years to support
the allegations.
   Ten of the reputed Mafia leaders were dropped as defendants in
October after signing agreements in which they promised to avoid
future dealings with the Teamsters.

   The Panchen Lama, Tibet's second-highest religious
leader and the mountain region's leading spokesman with the Chinese
government, died Saturday night, an official report said Sunday. He
was 50.
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency said the Buddhist priest died of
a sudden heart attack at the Tibetan town of Xigaze, where he was
attending ceremonies for the opening of a new stupa containing the
remains of past panchen lamas.
   The Panchen Lama, who chose to stay and support the Chinese when
the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising, was
also a vice-chairman of the National People's Congress, China's
parliament.
   The Dalai Lama, Tibet's traditional spiritual and political
leader, has demanded the Chinese grant domestic autonomy to the
region, which communist forces overran in 1950. The Panchen Lama has
supported the Chinese.
   China claims Tibet has been Chinese territory for the past seven
centuries. In an interview with the China Daily in September, the
Panchen Lama said he had talked by telephone with the Dalai Lama and
his relations with Tibet's spiritual leader were like those between
``brothers of the same faith.''
   The Dalai Lama denied any telephone contact with the Panchen Lama.

   Two grandchildren of Leon Trotsky found each
other after 57 years, and the reunion eased a dark legacy of
intrigue and violence that shaped their lives as surely as it did
Soviet history.
   ``We were a little like two shipwrecked sailors who meet on a
beach'' after a storm, Esteban Volkow Bronstein said in an interview
after returning from a visit to his half sister, Alexandra
Zaharnovna, in Moscow.
   They were parted by dictator Josef Stalin's bloody purges and his
bitter power struggle with Trotsky, a comrade of Lenin in the
Bolshevik revolution who had commanded the Red Army.
   Stalin sent family members to exile, prison camps or the grave.
He had Trotsky exiled and his name expunged from Soviet history
books, then killed at his modest home in Mexico City by an assassin
who used a mountaineer's ice ax.
   Volkow, 62, came to live with Trotsky in the 1930s and didn't
know Alexandra was alive until he got a telephone call from French
historian Pierre Broue in November. Broue, who had just visited the
Soviet Union, said she was alive but ill.
   Volkow had seen her last in 1931, when he and their mother were
expelled from the Soviet Union. He had a friend write some phrases
in Russian and called her.
   ``Dearest sister,'' he said into the crackling telephone. ``Your
little brother Esteban sends you an embrace, a warm embrace. I don't
speak Russian.''
   Alexandra, 65 and bedridden, replied in a voice weakened by a
long struggle with cancer.
   ``She spoke with much emotion, but I couldn't understand what she
said,'' he told the interviewer. ``I kept reading the phrases,
talking and talking and repeating my phrases. Finally I said `do
svidania,' goodbye. This was the call.''
   He went to the Soviet Embassy the next day and had a visa in 72
hours. Weeks later, he and his wife underwent what he described as
an ``extremely meticulous'' clearance at customs in Moscow.
   ``Maybe they thought we were subversives,'' he said with a slight
chuckle.
   Stalin accused Trotsky of subversion when their power struggle
began in the 1920s. The assassin struck in 1940, when Trotsky had
been an exile for 11 years.
   Volkow was 14 and still remembers his beloved grandfather lying
on the floor, blood pouring from the ugly ax wounds in his head. He
keeps the house as a museum and the interview was conducted there.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness and
reform, a cautious reassessment of Trotsky's historical role has
begun in the Soviet Union.
   Journalists and historians no longer call him a traitor to the
revolution, and a newspaper recently agreed with foreign historians
that Stalin had Trotsky killed. The Soviet Supreme Court has
rehabilitated his son Sergei, who was executed in a prison camp.
   Alexandra knew little about their grandfather and nothing of his
murder in Mexico, Volkow said.
   ``There is no information on Leon Trotksy'' in the Soviet Union,
``nothing, nothing, nothing,'' he said when telling of the scrutiny
customs officials gave an illustrated biography he was carrying for
his sister.
   Broue, the French historian, found Alexandra through a new Moscow
group called Memorial that is compiling an archive on Stalin's
millions of victims and hopes to erect monuments to them, Volkow
said.
   ``Alexandra had taken the decision to emerge from her anonymity,
to publicly acknowledge her relation and her heritage, only a few
weeks earlier,'' he said.
   Her brother said Alexandra, who had lost her parents and been
reviled, jailed and sent to internal exile because of her name, told
him ``she wasn't afraid of anything any longer. Not after all that
had happened to her, and her illness.''
   ``I hope she survives,'' he said. ``I want my daughters to know
their aunt.''
   He met with members of Memorial and thanked them for finding his
only sister. Volkow said he was surprised and gratified to find
Trotsky and members of his family prominently featured in a mural of
Stalin's victims in the group's office.
   Most of his five days in Moscow was spent with his sister,
speaking through an interpreter, and he discovered that memories of
their parting haunted her as their grandfather's death haunted him.
   ``She told me she remembered perfectly the departure, when I left
with our mother,'' he said. ``She always had a deep existential
doubt. Why? Because our mother left with me, not with her.''
   He said Broue found the answer to that riddle of the day
Trotsky's daughter Zina abandoned one of her two children. ``When
Stalin expelled my mother, he allowed her to take only her youngest
child,'' Volkow said.
   Alexandra, left with her paternal grandmother, eventually spent
six months in jail and five years in internal exile. She returned to
Moscow in 1954, after Stalin died, to study engineering, marry, bear
a daughter and live in fearful anonymity.
   Her brother, also an engineer, went to live with Trotsky after
their mother committed suicide in Paris. His father, Platon Volkow,
and Alexandra's, Zahar Mobline, died in Stalin's camps along with
other members of the family.
   Volkow considers himself a Mexican and found the Soviet Union to
be ``like another planet.''
   ``The truth is that the country is really alien to me,'' he said.
``I left so young I have practically no memories, no memories. Maybe
just the beginning of winter, the cold. ''
   A visit to the house in Moscow where his family had lived stirred
little but a childhood recollection of cold light pouring through
huge windows.

   John Tower, the defense
secretary-designate, told NATO strategists Sunday they should remain
skeptical of Kremlin disarmament overtures and keep the West's
nuclear options open.
   The 16-nation Western alliance risks mortgaging its security if
it fails to modernize its nuclear forces because of perceived
improvements in the East-West relationship, he said.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union remains a
powerful adversary with superior military capability, and the West
must not lose sight of that imbalance in its euphoria over
disarmament prospects, said Tower.
   ``If we fail to consider that capability, or if we fail to
consider its relevance in terms of their intentions, then we do so
at our peril,'' said the Texas Republican selected to head the
Pentagon under President George Bush.
   In restating his support for extending the range of some
European-based missiles, Tower joined other Americans who used the
annual allied defense strategy session to try and woo West Europeans
from their attraction to Gorbachev and the concept that the East
bloc now poses less of a threat.
   The weekend conference highlighted the gap between U.S. and
European public opinion on defense needs. West Germans, especially,
stake stronger hopes for disarmament on Gorbachev and are opposed to
anything considered an expansion of nuclear weapons in Europe.
   NATO's missile modification plan, adopted in 1983 and referred to
as ``modernization,'' is so sensitive in West Germany that the
nation's defense minister carefully avoided giving it open support
in a speech Saturday at the conference, which is dominated by
hard-line supporters of modernization.
   Tower met privately with the minister, Rupert Scholz, on Sunday
but apparently failed to persuade him to show stronger support for
NATO doctrine.
   ``We just illuminated some problems. We didn't come to any
solutions,'' Tower told The Associated Press.
   He declined to say whether he was able to get an assurance from
the West German that Bonn would support modernization.
   West Germany's alleged involvement with a suspected poison gas
plant in Libya, and its waning commitment to hosting NATO troops,
aircraft and hardware, were roundly criticized by Americans at the
conference on Saturday.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., accused Bonn of ``benign neglect'' in
the Libyan scandal and suggested senior officials have lied to hide
their culpability.
   On Sunday, the conference focused on new and mounting threats to
alliance unity posed by Gorbachev's ``charm offensive,'' the broad
public appeal generated by his array of proposals for disarmament
and democratic reform.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner raised the concern voiced
by many other influential defense strategists at the conference that
Gorbachev could fail and be replaced by a far more conservative
leader.
   ``We cannot entrust our security to one person alone or to
intentions,'' Woerner said. ``Both can change overnight.''
   George Younger, the British defense secretary, said in a speech
that the West was ``being offered disarmament by the leader of the
nation that has been arming and rearming for years.''
   Despite West German concerns over low-level combat aircraft
practices and other NATO activity stirring public protest, the
allies appeared to agree that disarmament should proceed cautiously
in the wake of the uncertain motives and prospects for Kremlin
reforms.

   Dick Frymire's renowned rooster Ted
disgraced himself on national television when he predicted
Cincinnati to win the Super Bowl. But he's not quitting and should
have his picks for top 10 TV shows ready soon.
   ``I tell everybody that Ted is the most famous unfried chicken in
the world today,'' says Frymire, who has a regional radio show
telling yarns about Ted and offering folklore and advice on
everything from getting rid of roaches and squirrels to calming a
crying baby.
   For the TV picks, Frymire will put the names of about 50 shows in
front of Ted and place a kernel of corn in front of each sign. The
first grain of corn Ted eats will be his choice of the No. 1 show,
with picks up to 10.
   Maybe that'll work out better than his Superbowl prediction,
which was made on national television, on CBS' ``Sunday Morning.''
   It all started in 1984 when Frymire put his pet into a pen shaded
with two old campaign posters, one of Ronald Reagan and the other of
Walter Mondale. He set out some numbers and corn kernels, and asked
Ted how many states Mondale would carry in the election.
   Ted ate the kernel in front of the number ``1.''
   ``I'm the biggest Democrat that ever was,'' Frymire said. ``And I
thought, `The chicken's gone Republican on me for sure.'''
   Since then, Ted has predicted winners of basketball games, the
Kentucky Derby and three Super Bowl games.

   After 18 years of catering to jet-setting
socialites, the exclusive Faces discotheque on the Rush Street night
life strip near downtown has gone out with a bang.
   Owner George Shales threw a last-look party for the club's 16,000
card-carrying members Friday night, and invited the public.
   Jim Kurianowicz, 42, who worked as a bartender there, lamented
changes he said helped lead to the closing of Faces.
   ``When it opened, Rush Street was like Vegas,'' Kurianowicz said.
``Now, the landmarks are gone. It's all executives, high-rises and
yuppies.''
   And the rent has gone from $2,500 a month to $14,000, Shales said.
   Customers during the early days became lifetime members for $50,
when video monitors flashed scenes from ``Charlie's Angels,'' and
the singles crowd rocked to quadrophonic sound.
   ``I used to come here when I was a bachelor. I knew all the

   They only had a week to do it, but an army
of offspring was enough to build a new house for 86-year-old Evan
Smith, replacing his fire-damaged homestead.
   His old house burned Jan. 7. He moved in with a daughter,
Patricia Smith, but yearned for a place of his own, she said.
   So his son, Jerry Smith, who is in the construction business in
Piedmont, S.C., proposed using his dad's insurance proceeds to build
a new house during his one-week vacation.
   ``I personally didn't think we could do it, but we did,'' Ms.
Smith said Saturday from this northeastern Arkansas town of 49
residents.
   ``With all of us together, we have the ability,'' Jerry Smith
said.
   The construction crew consisted of ``grandkids and
great-grandkids and brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law,'' Ms. Smith
said.
   ``We had everybody's cooperation _ we had to, to get this all
done in this length of time. We have really pitched in. When we
started, oh, Lord, we had 25 folks out there helping,'' she said.
``It is a labor of love. I don't know what else you'd call it.''

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Palestinian uprising has caused a recession
in the occupied territories and slowed Israel's economic growth by
forcing more military spending and scaring away tourists.
   Samir Abdullah, a Palestinian economist, says conditions could
worsen as the Palestinians continue to pursue their goal of ending
21 years of Israeli rule in the occupied lands.
   ``Don't think that money problems will bring the uprising to the
end,'' he said. ``The Palestinian people are tasting the results of
their struggle.''
   Thousands of Arabs, heeding the demands of the underground
leaders of the 13-month revolt, and have quit jobs in Israel,
boycotted Israeli-made goods and staged frequent general strikes in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Now the occupied lands are in a recession, private analysts say.
   Abdullah said the lands' gross national product, the value of all
goods and services, shrank from $1.5 billion in 1987 to $1.2 billion
in 1988.
   For the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
supporting the uprising has meant learning to live with less.
   Ziad, a jewelry merchant in the Arab market of Jerusalem's Old
City, says his sales have fallen sharply in the past year because of
strikes and the decline in tourists.
   ``We don't earn enough to feed the family or even to replace the
stock we do manage to sell,'' said Ziad, who asked that his last
name be withheld.
   To cut expenses, he has moved his six children from private to
public schools. There is no money for new clothes, and he says he
buys meat for the family ``maybe once a week.''
   Ziad says he will continue to support the uprising ``until we
free our homeland from the Israelis.''
   Even traditional Arab hospitality, characterized by heaping
sweets and coffee upon visitors, is being sacrificed.
   Slogans on the walls of several Arab villages admonish: ``One
glass of water will satisfy a guest.''
   In Israel, the $35 billion economy grew a disappointing 1 percent
in 1988, down from 5 percent a year earlier, according to government
statistics.
   Unemployment among Israel's 4.4 million people has risen from 5.6
percent to more than 7 percent since the uprising started in
December 1987.
   At the same time, the military is spending about $14 million a
month for the thousands of reserve soldiers sent to the occupied
lands to try to quell stone-throwing and other Palestinian
demonstrations, the Defense Ministry says.
   Among the hardest hit industries is textile manufacturing, which
fell sharply last year because Arab laborers quit their jobs,
according to a report by the Industry Ministry. Textile sales to the
occupied territories dropped more than a third because of the
Palestinian boycott, the report says.
   A Western economist who requested anonymity said one-quarter of
the 110,000 Palestinians who worked in Israel before the uprising
have quit their jobs.
   The Industry Ministry reports that overall sales of Israeli goods
to the territories fell 70 percent last year to $140 million.
   The nation's tourist industry expected a big year in 1988,
Israel's 40th anniversary. But only 1.3 million people visited, a 14
percent drop from 1987.
   Mordechai Ben-Ari, the Tourism Ministry's spokesman, says the
decline meant a loss of about $250 million in foreign exchange
earnings.
   In many hotels, more than 70 percent of the rooms are empty and
the Israel Hotel Association has demanded low-interest loans to keep
afloat.
   ``We can't keep on going this way indefinitely,'' Eli Paposhado,
president of the association, told a hoteliers' convention last
week. ``The government must help us to keep afloat until there are
better days.''
   But the government also is in trouble. The uprising has only
added to chronic problems such as inflation, an overvalued currency
and government-run industries that are finding it harder to compete
in the world market.

<HEAD>Confirmation Hearings, Pay Raises Dominate Agenda</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate bores ahead with confirmation
proceedings on President Bush's Cabinet this week, while the
political imperative for most House members seems to be to stay out
of sight and pocket a $45,000 pay raise without a vote.
   Little or no major action is expected on the key issue facing
Congress _ reducing the federal deficit _ until after President Bush
presents his own proposals at a joint session of Congress on Feb. 9.
   In the meantime, Democratic officials say at least three and
perhaps more Cabinet appointees will come up for a vote in the
Senate this week, and all are expected to win easy confirmation. The
list includes Robert Mosbacher as Commerce Secretary, Carla Hills as
trade representative and Samuel Skinner to run the Transportation
Department.
   Votes also are possible this week on the appointments of Manuel
Lujan as Interior Secretary and Michael Boskin to head the
president's Council of Economic Advisers.
   The timing is less certain for Defense Secretary-designate John
Tower, whose hearing will continue before the Senate Armed Services
Committee on Tuesday. Ed Derwinski, Bush's choice to lead the
Department of Veterans Affairs, has his confirmation hearing
beginning on Monday.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, who has emerged as the most controversial
Cabinet appointee because of uncertainty over his views on abortion,
faces the Senate Finance Committee at a confirmation Wednesday on
his appointment as Secretary of Health and Human Resources.
   Sullivan sought to reassure conservative Republicans that he
shares their opposition to abortion last week after he was quoted as
having told one lawmaker that he does not favor overturning the
Supreme Court decision that legalized the operations.
   The Senate confirmed three Cabinet officials last week, approving
Secretary of State James A. Baker III; Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole and Budget Director Richard Darman on votes of 99-0. In
addition, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady; Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos are
holdover appointments from the Reagan administration and do not
require confirmation.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, while disclosing plans
for confirmation votes this week, has promised a vote on the pay
raise but has not yet said when it will be.
   Congressional pay is scheduled to rise from $89,500 a year to
$135,000 a year beginning Feb. 8 unless both houses specifically
reject the plan.
   The Senate is expected to vote against the raise in a roll call
that will be almost entirely symbolic, since Democratic and
Republican House leaders have agreed not to allow the issue to come
to the floor until after the pay raise takes effect on Feb. 8. Their
decision has drawn the protest of fewer than three dozen of the 435
House members.
   Party leaders in both houses are working privately to draft
provisions banning the practice of taking money for making speeches
and other curtailments in congressional financial perks to offset
the impact of the pay raise. The possibilities include restricting
the practice of taking vacations paid for by industry groups and
others, as well as stopping members of Congress from converting
leftover campaign funds to personal use when they retire.
   Both houses are holding hearings this week on two other key
issues, the faltering savings and loans industry and the flood of
junk-bond-financed leveraged buyouts of major corporations.
   In addition, a special Senate panel starts laying out the results
of its yearlong investigation of alleged improprieties in federal
Indian programs.
   The Bush administration last week floated the idea of charging a
fee of 25 cents on each $100 of deposits in S&amp;Ls to help raise cash
to close hundreds of insolvent institutions.
   The proposal received a chilly reception on Capitol Hill and by
week's end both Bush and Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M.
Danny Wall were saying it was just one of several options being
considered.
   The tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee will take its
first hard look this year into the rapid pace at which some of the
nation's largest companies are loading themselves with debt in
takeovers and defenses against them.
   The AFL-CIO last week called on the Senate Finance Committee to
eliminate or restrict the interest deductions on debt-financed
takeovers, saying 90,000 of its union members have lost their jobs
this decade because of them.

<HEAD>Bhutto's Main Rival Wins Assembly Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key rival of Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto won a seat in the National Assembly, election results
indicated Sunday, and he is expected to lead opposition forces in
the legislature.
   The official returns from the by-election Saturday gave Ghulam
Mustafi Jatoi's conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance seven seats
in the assembly and Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning People's Party four
seats.
   The victory for Jatoi and his party came after a humiliating
defeat in his home district of southern Sind Province in an election
in November.
   Two other seats went to an independent and the candidate of a
minor party.
   Lawmakers from Ms. Bhutto's party and its allies still outnumber
the nine-party Moslem alliance by two-to-one in the assembly, or
lower house Parliament.
   Sunday's results were not considered a defeat for Ms. Bhutto
because all the Moslem alliance's victories remained confined to the
wealthy and populous Punjab province, where it emerged strongest in
November when Pakistan held its first free elections in 11 years.
   The returns published by the Pakistan Election Commission on
Sunday indicated that just under 50 percent of the 3 million
eligible voters turned out for the by-election, the same percentage
as voted in November.
   At stake were 13 seats in the 237-seat National Assembly and
seven seats in provincial assemblies of districts where candidates
in November won more than one seat, or where the vote was postponed
because a candidate died.
   In the provincial contests, the two leading parties won three
seats each, and an independent won one.
   Chief Election Commissioner S.A. Nusrat said voting was calm and
peaceful except for in one district of Lahore, the Punjab capital,
where police had to break up a stone-throwing melee between rival
supporters of Ms. Bhutto and Jatoi. Nusrat said the disturbance did
not disrupt voting.
   Sunday's results reflected November's voting pattern.
   Ms. Bhutto's party emerged the strongest nationwide but fell
short of an outright majority. The Moslem alliance, which includes
proteges of the late military dictator Mohammad Zia ul-Haq,
established a power base in Punjab where it now controls the
provincial legislature.
   Zia died in a plane crash in August, clearing the way for Ms.
Bhutto and her allies to assume power. Zia overthrew Ms. Bhutto's
father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a bloodless 1977 coup
and ordered him hanged two years later on conviction of conspiring
to murder a political opponent.
   Jatoi was a minister in Ms. Bhutto's Cabinet and was jailed for
15 months for his opposition to Zia's rule.
   He remained with the Pakistan People's Party until Ms. Bhutto
returned home from self-imposed exile in Europe in 1986 to head the
party.
   Jatoi opposed Ms. Bhutto's leadership and the governing of a
Moslem nation by a woman. He broke away from the party to form his
National People's Party.
   When the new members of the National Assembly take their seats,
Jatoi is expected to be the floor leader for the Islamic Democratic
Alliance forces.

<HEAD>Army Buying Additional Desert Training Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Congress ponders a recommendation to close
86 smaller military facilities, the Army is preparing to buy 200,000
acres adjacent to its main training area to accommodate modern
tanks, planes and electronic gear that need more and more room for
large-scale maneuvers.
   Army officials say they need $29 million to expand the National
Training Center at Fort Irwin, next to Death Valley in California.
By comparison, the Base Alignments and Closing Commission has said
$693 million can be saved annually by shutting the facilities it
recommended.
   Outgoing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has already sent the
commission's recommendations on base closings to Congress, which
take effect unless blocked by both houses. Senior lawmakers say
rejection of the package is unlikely.
   Likewise, Congress has not objected to the Army's plans to buy
200,000 acres adjacent to the 632,000-acre Fort Irwin.
   The expansion conforms with the commission's expression of
``acute concern about the requirement of the Armed Forces for
adequate training areas.''
   None of the bases recommended for closing were large enough for
large-scale maneuvers, said Paul W. Johnson, deputy assistant Army
secretary for installations and housing.
   In addition to buying land at Fort Irwin, Johnson said, the Army
is considering a 63,000-acre expansion of a training facility at
Yakima, Wash., and needs yet another major training center of at
least 600,000 acres.
   Current budget requests do not contain money for acquiring the
second major training facility, which likely would be a joint
project by the Air Force and the Army, Johnson said in an interview.
   ``It's not in the five-year plan yet,'' he said.
   Two problems cited repeatedly by Pentagon and commission
officials are that bases established in remote areas during World
War II are now surrounded by dense populations, and that the
services require more land to train with increasingly faster, more
powerful and more sophisticated weaponry.
   ``The increasing sophistication and extended ranges of modern
weapons continually increase the requirements for training areas,''
said the commission report, issued last month.
   ``The five nautical miles required by a World War II fighter
aircraft for aerial maneuver have grown to 40 miles today,'' the
report said. That range will extend to 100 miles as the services
introduce the next generation of fighters over the next decade, it
said.
   Similarly, ``an Army mechanized battalion needs more than 80,000
acres to practice standard maneuvers; its World War II predecessor
required fewer than 4,000,'' it said.
   For Army brigades, consisting of two or more battalions, Fort
Irwin is the only base large enough to train with high speed M-1
Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles, said Johnson.
   While the torrid desert conditions at Fort Irwin provide good
training for the Middle East and Southwest Asia, said Army spokesman
Lt. Col. Robert Millard, it is not ideal for troops practicing to do
battle in Europe.
   ``Ideally, the land should resemble the terrain you intend to
fight on,'' said Millard, interviewed jointly with Johnson.
   The need for maneuvering room seems to have crept up on Army in
the 1960's and 1970's. In 1971, the Army turned Fort Irwin over to
the National Guard. Realizing the need for open spaces, the Army
reclaimed Fort Irwin in 1981, and now counts it among its key
facilities around the globe.
   The need for bigger training spaces also affects other major
powers.
   ``The commission notes in passing that Soviet forces have at
their disposal vast training areas in which to practice large-unit
maneuvers,'' the base closing report said.
   Great Britain and West Germany train in the vast expanses of
Canada, said Capt. Don Roy, a spokesman for the Canadian military.
   Britain and West Germany keep permanent detachments of tanks at
Suffield, Alberta, on the Canadian plains, and they stage air
maneuvers at Goose Bay, Labrador, which has huge flying ranges that
are one-third the size of the whole of West Germany.
   U.S. Army officials said they have not discussed with the
Canadian government the possibility of joint maneuvers in Canada.
   While its ships obviously do not have space constraints at sea,
the Navy tried to solve maneuvering problems faced by its land-based
pilots by purchasing a huge tract at the Lemoore Naval Air Station
in the San Joaquin Valley of California in the 1950's, said retired
Adm. Wesley McDonald, a former deputy Chief of Naval Operations for
aviation.
   Lemoore opened July 8, 1961, on an alkaline patch surrounded by
farmland 45 miles south of Fresno, said base spokesman Dennis
McGrath.

   ST-JEROME, Quebec (AP) _ A psychiatric patient playing with
matches started a hospital fire Sunday that killed five people and
forced hundreds to flee the building, authorities said.
   The fire broke out in the pre-dawn hours in a small room in the
emergency ward on the first floor of the Hotel-Dieu Hospital in
St-Jerome, 25 miles northwest of Montreal, authorities said.
   Hospital director Andre St-Denis said about 350 patients and 80
staff members were inside the seven-story hospital at the time. He
said the evacuation went quickly and without panic.
   The dead were not immediately identified, but two bodies were
found in the emergency ward, authorities said.
   Provincial police said the fire was started by a patient from the
psychiatric ward playing with matches. It was not known if that
patient was among the dead.
   St-Jerome fire director Jacques Charbonneau said a fire-warning
system was working in that part of the hospital at the time.
Firefighters contained the blaze on the ground floor, where the
emergency ward was completely destroyed.

<TEXT>
   Intense interest in revamping and expanding
college humanities requirements has translated into little success
in the past five years, according to a study released Sunday.
   The study sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities
found that students are only slightly more likely to have to take
such courses in order to graduate, and it is possible to bypass many
significant fields of knowledge en route to a degree.
   General requirements in the humanities area rose an average of
1.5 hours from 1983-84 to 1988-89 _ a 6.2 percent increase,
according to the study of course requirements at 496 colleges and
universities.
   Average increases in requirements for English and American
literature, foreign languages and literature, history and philosophy
all totaled .2 credit hours or less over the five-year period.
   ``One would have hoped that all the concern about curriculum
reform would have resulted in more,'' said endowment chairwoman
Lynne Cheney.
   ``There's been such emphasis and such effort in the past five
years to try to restore form and substance to undergraduate
requirements,'' she said in an interview last week. ``I don't mean
to suggest at all that colleges are not trying. What this survey
shows is how hard it is.''
   Mrs. Cheney attributed some of the problems to ``outside
pressures'' and heavy course requirements for certain majors.
   For example, she said, music school accrediting agencies require
that 65 percent of all course work be subjects related to music.
``That makes it very hard to carve out the time,'' she said. ``And
the requirements in engineering are so heavy that it's very
difficult for an engineering student to find time'' for humanities
requirements.
   Mrs. Cheney said the one bright spot in the survey is that the
number of schools letting students choose from a virtually unlimited
list of courses has decreased. Only 13 percent of schools allow
students to choose from unlimited course offerings, down from 19
percent five years ago.
   ``That's a big drop,'' she said. ``The structure is tightening
up. When you've got a situation where students are told `take three
of the following' and they can choose from 620 courses, they're
going to miss major areas of human knowledge.''
   Currently, Mrs. Cheney said, it is possible to earn a bachelor's
degree from 38 percent of colleges and universities without taking
any course in history; 45 percent without taking a course in English
or American literature; 62 percent without taking a philosophy
course; and 77 percent without studying a foreign language.
   The NEH study found that requirements in math and the sciences
were increased by a greater number of hours than those for
humanities.
   For example, math requirements rose from two to 2.5 hours from
1983 to 1988, a 24 percent hike. Natural sciences and social science
requirements each climbed an average of 0.4 hours, for increases of
10.3 percent and 7.3 percent respectively.
   Mrs. Cheney said the higher increases in math and science do not
necessarily reflect college priorities because there were so few
requirements in that area to begin with. For example, the two hours
in math in 1983 compared to 23.5 hours that year in general
humanities, including 4.5 hours of English composition.
   The math and science requirements are welcome in any case, she
said, because ``there are at least as many people who major in the
humanities who do not have sufficient literacy in science and math
as there are people who are engineering majors who don't know about
the humanities. It is a two-sided problem.''

<HEAD>Traders Donate Heavily To Political Campaigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political action committees affiliated with
Chicago futures markets have donated millions of dollars to the
election campaigns of officials who oversee regulation of the
exchanges, which are now targets of a federal investigation, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Auction Markets Political Action Committee, which represents
the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Commodity Futures Political
Fund, representing the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have funded the
campaigns of lawmakers on congressional committees regulating
futures markets, the Chicago Tribune said.
   The two exchanges are being investigated by federal officials who
suspect widespread fraud in trading practices.
   Authorities refuse to comment, but the investigation reportedly
centers on allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders
systematically cheated customers in illegal trades.
   Some commodities experts say the investigation could bring about
new government regulations, which traders oppose.
   ``The worst result would be that it would cast a shadow over the
entire industry, ... and we wind up facing regulatory proposals,''
said Alan J. Brody, president of New York's Commodity Exchange.
   The Tribune reported that traders donated $1.4 million to the two
PACs linked to the Chicago markets during the 1987-88 election cycle.
   Of that amount, $856,750 was donated to congressional campaigns _
up sharply from the $535,100 the PACs donated in the 1985-86 cycle,
the newspaper said.
   The contributions included some hefty gifts to lawmakers who have
introduced bills that would benefit the commodities industries, the
Tribune said.
   In 1984, the two groups gave $21,000 to Campaign America, a PAC
set up by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan. Individual traders also donated
$49,500 to Dole's PAC, the Tribune said.
   Dole, then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, helped to
work out a special tax bailout to save traders about $300 million
annually, the paper reported.
   Dole spokesman Walt Riker, reached Sunday at his Springfield,
Va., home, denied the senator had been influenced by the donations.
   ``PAC contributions have absolutely no relation to how a member
votes, and to say otherwise is garbage,'' Riker said. ``At least
speaking for Senator Dole, I know that that's true.''
   Rep. Martin Russo, D-Ill., received $38,850 from the two PACS and
other sources related to the commodities industry in the 1981-82
election cycle, and an additional $25,000 in 1983-84, the newspaper
said.
   In 1981, Russo sponsored a measure that would have closed a tax
loophole for everyone except traders, leaving them with a savings of
as much as $400 million annually, according to Common Cause, a
citizens' interest group in Washington.
   The bill did not pass, and Russo has denied he was influenced by
the contributions. He has not been accused of any illegality, the
newspaper said.
   In 1984, the PACs contributed $20,000 to the re-election campaign
of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who was then head of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, which is one of the panels that oversees the
commodities industry, the newspaper said.
   Calls to the congressional offices and residences of Russo and
Helms were not answered Sunday.

<HEAD>Opening Statements Scheduled in `Night Stalker' Satanic Serial Killer
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three and a half years after his capture by an
angry mob, the defendant in the ``Night Stalker'' case begins trial
Monday charged in the satanic serial slayings of 13 people that
terrorized California in 1985.
   Even for sensational serial murder trials, this one will have
unusual security for the unpredictable defendant, Richard Ramirez,
who once yelled ``Hail, Satan!'' and flashed a demonic symbol in
court. Ramirez has been more subdued recently and taken to wearing
black clothing and sunglasses which he uses to peer at the crowd.
   Trials here in recent years have included the ``Hillside
Strangler'' case of Angelo Buono Jr., convicted of the sex slayings
of nine young women and girls, and the case of William Bonin,
convicted of the ``Freeway Killer'' sex murders of 10 young men.
   But Ramirez will wear leg shackles while seated in court. And
spectators entering the courtroom will have to pass through a metal
detector.
   The precautions were put into effect last August when the lead
prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Philip Halpin, claimed Ramirez
had threatened to kill him in court with a smuggled gun then turn it
on spectators.
   Defense attorney Daniel Hernandez denied the threat, but the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department said threats indeed had been
made and established the strong security.
   Ramirez, 28, a pale, shaggy-haired drifter from El Paso, Texas,
is charged with 13 counts of murder and 30 other felonies, including
rape, robbery and attempted murder. He could receive the death
penalty if convicted.
   The charges stem from a 1985 summer crime spree in which a
nocturnal killer dubbed the ``Night Stalker'' entered homes through
unlocked windows or doors, raped women, killed both men and women
with execution-style gunshot blasts to the head and stole jewelry
and other valuables.
   Prosecutors are anxious to begin testimony in the much-delayed
trial, which officially began with jury selection in July.
Attorneys' opening statements are set for Monday morning.
   The entire trial before Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan is
expected to take two years.
   The most recent delay was caused by a controversy over the racial
makeup of the jury. The defense accused prosecutors of excluding
Hispanics and black women while the prosecution accused the defense
of excluding whites and Asians.
   A 12-member jury of seven women and five men, comprised of six
blacks and six Hispanics, was finally chosen last week. There are
also 12 alternates.
   Another late development was a report Thursday that a state
appellate court ruled that Ramirez's lawyer, Hernandez, failed to
meet professional standards in a previous murder case. The appellate
court said Hernandez failed to adequately interview and subpoena
witnesses and failed to research the law, among other things.
   Concerns by judges and prosecutors about Hernandez's competence
to represent Ramirez in the complex capital murder case have
surfaced several times, but he remains as counsel.
   While the slayings were going on, fear swept the city. Gun sales
and self-defense classes increased. Citizens shut their doors and
windows tight despite a 100-degree heat wave. The terror spread as
the crimes moved north to San Francisco and south to Orange County;
Ramirez also is charged in both areas.
   One victim's eyes were gouged out. Several women testified at
Ramirez's preliminary hearing in 1986 that after the killer murdered
their husbands they were raped and ordered to ``swear to Satan.''
   The killer often scrawled on walls drawings of pentagrams,
inverted five-pointed stars commonly associated with devil worship.
   During his 1985 arraignment, Ramirez fueled speculation that he
was indeed a devil worshiper when he yelled ``Hail, Satan!'' and
flashed a pentagrammed palm in court.
   He was arrested after he was chased and beaten by an angry East
Los Angeles mob during the 1985 Labor Day Weekend when he allegedly
tried to steal a car. The same day, his picture appeared in
newspapers as the prime suspect in the crime spree.

<HEAD>Many Ponder The Secrets Bundy Took To The Chair</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As haunting as he was in life, Ted Bundy is
proving even more enigmatic in death as homicide investigators and
the families of murder victims wonder what secrets the serial killer
took to the electric chair.
   In the four days before he was put to death Tuesday for the 1978
rape and murder of a 12-year-old Florida girl, Bundy confessed to 23
murders in the 1970s in Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Washington,
including some in which he was not a suspect or that investigators
were unable to match to any known slayings.
   Across the country, prosecutors and detectives took another look
at unsolved cases as word spread that investigators talking to Bundy
at the Florida State Prison believed he may have murdered 100 young
women.
   ``Even the denials he gave me when I brought up certain cases
were just not Bundy-type denials,'' said Robert Keppel, a Washington
state attorney general's investigator who probed eight so-called
``Ted'' killings for 15 years. Bundy confessed to those slayings and
others before his execution. But there are several other murders in
Washington that Keppel wonders about.
   ``They (the denials) led me to think he was a suspect,'' said
Keppel.
   Keppel, whom Bundy invited to Florida for his 11th-hour
confessions, believes his long involvement with the serial killer
has helped him detect changes in Bundy's mood and speech that tipped
him off when Bundy was lying.
   It was Keppel who suggested Bundy might be responsible for more
than 100 slayings.
   The FBI said last week that it is planning a meeting in February
of law enforcement agencies that suspect Bundy may be responsible
for unsolved homicides in their states.
   Terry Green, a major case specialist with the bureau's Violent
Criminal Apprehension effort in Quantico, Va., where the meeting
will be held, said the idea is to get investigators ``in one place
so we can discuss the peculiarities in each case.''
   In addition to the slaying of the Florida girl, Bundy had been
convicted of murdering two sorority sisters at Florida State
University in 1978.
   Bundy's name has surfaced as a possible suspect in slayings in
Burlington, Vt., where he was born in 1946; in Pennsylvania and New
Jersey during the time Bundy was a student at Temple University in
Philadelphia, and throughout the West.
   In Utah, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Lt. Ben Forbes said
investigators have looked at unsolved cases since Bundy confessed to
killing eight women and girls in the state. But Forbes said he
doesn't know whether there might be more victims.
   ``We have researched now with our state medical examiner any
`Jane Does' back to the 1970s. There were only four or five and none
appear to be his work,'' Forbes said.
   In Vermont, Burlington police Detective Thomas Tremblay said
Bundy is not a suspect in a 1971 murder and rape. ``We have no
evidence or information that links him to the scene of our
homicide,'' he said.
   The connection was a bit stronger in New Jersey, where two
19-year-old women were stabbed to death on Memorial Day 1969. Arthur
Norman, a forensic psychologist who interviewed Bundy for his
defense, telephoned Atlantic County, N.J., prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz
shortly after the execution to say Bundy had confessed to those
murders.
   Blitz said the information from Norman ``wasn't satisfying'' as a
serious link to Bundy, but the case is being looked at again.
   ``Bundy said while he was attending Temple he went to the Jersey
shore, picked up two girls,'' Blitz said. ``Norman came to the
conclusion that he killed these two girls. Bundy never admitted it.
It was based on Norman's conclusions.''
   In his confessions, Bundy specifically denied committing any
murders in Vermont or New Jersey.
   Keppel suspects that Bundy, who was 42 when he was put to death,
began his murderous ways when he was 14 and living in Tacoma, Wash.,
even though Bundy denied involvement in the 1961 disappearance and
presumed murder of Ann Marie Burr, who was 8 when she was abducted
from her bedroom.
   ``He said he was too young, he lived too far away. Those were
pretty weak excuses,'' said Keppel, who added he had interviewed
Bundy enough to develop a sense of when Bundy was being evasive or
misleading.
   Like Keppel, Beverly Burr still suspects Bundy in the death of
her daughter.
   ``I wrote to him (Bundy) and he emphasized he was a normal
14-year-old boy, that he didn't live near us and didn't roam around
at night. I know that's not true,'' she said. ``As far as we know he
was not a normal 14-year-old boy. But right now, there just isn't
much I can do.''

<HEAD>White House Staff Chief Admonishes Congress To Negotiate In Good
Faith</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu declared
Sunday that ``positioning ... to deal with eventual failure'' by
some members of Congress could wreck efforts to reach a bipartisan
budget agreement.
   ``If that's the additude going in, then none of us will
succeed,'' Sununu said in a broadcast interview.
   Sununu also said a proposal for a fee on deposits to help shore
up ailing savings and loans remains a live option, despite
widespread congressional and industry opposition to the plan.
   ``There are a variety of options being examined,'' Sununu said on
ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   He said opponents of the proposed fee were able to ``take the
lead and put the worst foot forward on the plan'' after the Bush
administration made a good-faith effort at early consulations with
House and Senate leaders.
   ``I guess the most disappointing part of the whole thing is the
effort that was being made to get the Congress early enough to let
them be apart of crafting alternatives resulted in a firestorm on
one alternative that was not necessarily the leading candidate,''
Sununu said.
   The savings and loan proposal would call for a fee of about $2.50
for every $1,000 deposited in federally insured savings and loans
and commercial banks.
   Disclosure that the Treasury Department was considering such a
plan complicated Bush's otherwise harmonious first week in office.
   While repeating Bush's assertion Friday that the plan had not yet
reached the White House, Sununu noted that financial institutions
have long paid a fee for federal deposit insurance.
   He said the plan under study was simply a matter of ``taking the
current fee and adjusting it to affect the reality.''
   If financial institutions were to pass along such an increased
fee directly to depositers, American savers still would be getting a
bargain for having their savings insured by their government, he
said.
   Sununu said Bush still intends to work with Congress on forging
bipartisan solutions on both the savings and loan and the larger
budget crises.
   ``We're looking for the Democrat Congress to be part of
developing a solution,'' he said. ``And any concern we have is ...
the different slices of Congress positioning itself to deal with
evenutal failure.''
   Interviewed on the same program, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
and Rep. William Gray III, D-Pa., both voiced skepticism over Bush's
announced intention to produce a budget by Feb. 9 that meets
deficit-reduction targets without new taxes.
   Hollings, charirman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said the
administration was glossing over the deficit problem with
too-optimistic economic assumptions.
   And Gray said the president had put himself ``in a box'' with his
no-new-taxes pledge, but should relent and vow support of between
$13 billion and $14 billion in new revenues.
   Gray is immediate past chairman of the House Budget Committee, a
rotating assignment, and a member of the House Democratic leadership.
   Sununu, asked about the remarks of Hollings and Gray, said:
``Both the senator and the congressman appeared to be positioning in
case there's a failure. This adminstration ... is committed to
moving to a success.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, also voiced skepticism about the no-new-taxes pledge in
an interview on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   ``I think the odds are against him on that one,'' Bentsen said
when asked about Bush's chances of bringing the budget deficit down
to $100 billion without raising taxes.
   Bentsen also criticized the proposed fee on savings deposits,
saying ``that trial balloon of putting a tax on deposits was really
very foolish.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush cancelled a planned visit to the
presidential retreat at Camp David on Sunday and stayed home at the
White House to nurse a persistent cold.
   Bush, whose first full week in office was marked by long working
hours and frequent short trips about town, decided to take it easy
in hopes of conquering the cold that by week's end had left his
voice noticeably raspy, according to aides.
   ``He just has a cold, a regular cold,and is taking some
decongestants,'' said spokesman Bruce Zanca.
   Bush had planned to travel by helicopter to Camp David in the
nearby mountains of Maryland and spend most of the day there. He had
invited House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and his wife to join him
there for what White House aides said was to have been a purely
social gettogether.
   Bush's hoarseness was evident Friday at his first news conference
as president. ``I sound worse than I feel,'' he said.

   Travelers who don't want to see the sights
alone can find a friend through Travel Buddy, which provides
companions who will accompany ``anyone, any age, to anywhere in the
world.''
   Since Dona M. Risdall began operating Travel Buddy out of her
home in suburban Bloomington in 1987, the service has provided
``buddies'' for more than 100 travelers in the United States and
overseas. The buddies, who are carefully screened, get their tickets
paid by the clients, but pay other expenses.
   ``I think they relax a lot more when they're on a trip with a
buddy. I think it's extra security,'' Ms. Risdall said. ``I call it
`Travel Buddy' because that's what they are _ a really good buddy to
the client.''
   Among Ms. Risdall's clients are the elderly, the slightly
handicapped and small children. The youngest were a couple of girls,
ages 6 and 7, who flew with a buddy to visit their father in Texas.
   ``There's a lot of early retirees that have the money but have no
one to go with,'' Ms. Risdall said.
   She got the idea for the service at her job as a front-desk
assistant at an athletic club in Bloomington.
   ``Just time and time again I heard so many say, `My wife or
husband has passed away,' and they'd love to travel, but they don't
want to go alone,'' she said.
   Ms. Risdall, 49, started her business with about $5,000, which
was used mostly for printing and mailing brochures.
   For a fee _ $65 for non-members, $45 for members _ Risdall lines
up a traveler with a buddy of similar background and interests. The
annual membership fee is $25, and travelers either can make their
own travel arrangements or Ms. Risdall will make them through a
travel agent she works with.
   Ms. Risdall screens all prospective buddies and requires
references. She said she has about 50 men and women of all ages in
her listings.
   This month Ms. Risdall began a branch operation in Dallas out of
a former Buddy's home, and she's thinking about a similar branch in
Arizona.
   There are other organizations that provide companions for
disabled travelers, said Peter Shaw-Lawrence, of the New York
City-based Society for the Advancement of Travel for the Handicapped.
   ``Each of these organizations may have slightly different
things,'' he said.
   A get-acquainted session is arranged between the traveler and the
prospective buddy if both are from around Minneapolis. If the client
lives out of state, Ms. Risdall chooses the buddy.
   Agatha Drilling, 70, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, contacted Travel
Buddy after reading a magazine article about the service. She was
lined up with a companion who drove with her to Phoenix in December.
   ``I think it's great,'' said Ms. Drilling, who plans to use the
service again. ``You get somebody who you can feel is trustworthy
because they were checked out.''
   Her ``buddy,'' Natalie Kirstiuk, 40, of Fridley, said she applied
to be a buddy because she loves to travel.
   ``It was a chance to see more of the country that I haven't
seen,'' she said.
   Ms. Risdall has provided buddies for travelers going to Europe
and Australia, but the trip can be as short as to North Dakota.
   Ms. Risdall, whose friends tease her for being a workaholic,
hasn't taken a vacation herself for years. ``When a trip to Hawaii
comes along, I'm going to go,'' she said.

   Navy salvage teams managed to refloat the
destroyer USS Spruance after the ship had been aground for three
days near a Bahamian Island, Navy officials said Sunday.
   The ship based in Mayport ran aground Wednesday off Andros
Island, 150 miles southeast of Miami, during a routine training
operation.
   It took the combination of two successive high tides and the
steady tugging of two other ships to free the destroyer, said Lt.
Cmdr. Tim Taylor of the Mayport Naval Station.
   ``The USS Grasp was really the main player in this drama,''
Taylor said. The salvage ship and the USNS Mohawk, an ocean-going
tug, pulled the 563-foot Spruance free shortly before midnight
Saturday.
   Navy divers inspected Spruance's hull Sunday. ``They confirmed
the hull is intact,'' Taylor said.
   But he added that the propellers had been damaged so the Grasp is
towing the disabled destroyer to a shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss.,
for repairs.
   The Navy was still investigating the cause of the grounding,
Taylor said. Damage estimates won't be available until the destroyer
reaches Pascagoula.
   No one was injured and the Spruance's crew remained aboard the
vessel.

<TEXT>
   A quarterfinal contest for the World Chess
Championship Candidates series resumes Monday after a first-match
draw between former world champion Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet
Union and Iceland's Johann Hjartarson.
   The winner of the Candidates series of matches will challenge
world champion Garri Kasparov for his world title in 1990.
   Hjartarson, 25, playing white, offered the draw after 15 moves
Saturday and Karpov, 37, accepted.
   The match is only six games, and Karpov must be cautious in
settling for a draw because just one win by Hjartarson would put the
Icelandic grandmaster in a very strong position, one chess analyst
said.
   Chess analysts said the key to Saturday's game, described as the
doubly delayed exchange variation of the Ruy Lopez, was Hjartarson's
11th move, when he moved his Knight to Queen-Bishop 4, positionally
making continuation of the game questionable.
   One analyst said Hjartarson played not so much to win, but to
keep from losing to the 11-time world champion.
   Three quarterfinals matches are under way or about to begin. The
fourth was won by British Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman, who
advanced to the semifinals.

   No arrests have been made but revenge is a
strong candidate as motive in the killing nearly two weeks ago of
the head of Oregon's prison system, a man who had received death
threats.
   Michael Francke, 42, formerly a law enforcement official in New
Mexico, was stabbed in the heart the evening of Jan. 17 during an
attack in a parking lot outside the Corrections Department office.
   Police won't divulge many details about the crime, such as any
injuries Francke may have suffered besides the fatal stab wound.
   ``You need to have something that only you know and the murderer
knows, to use for corroboration,'' said Marion County District
Attorney Dale Penn, who's leading the investigation.
   According to published reports, Francke apparently stumbled 25
yards from the parking lot to the building, where he broke a glass
pane in a door before collapsing.
   Late-working colleagues searched for Francke after finding his
car, one door ajar, in the parking lot.
   A guard found his body was found at the rarely used entry. No
weapon was found.
   Robbery hasn't been ruled out as a motive, but Penn said
investigators are pursuing the possibility that Francke's death was
a revenge killing.
   Francke served as a prosecutor, judge and head of corrections in
New Mexico before being hired in May 1987 to take charge of Oregon's
severely overcrowded prison system.
   He no doubt made enemies in both states, investigators have said.
   ``This could be random street violence, a regular old strong-arm
robbery,'' Penn said. ``But it also could be a complicated
conspiracy because of the positions that he has held in the two
states.
   ``It is a very difficult case, just because of his background.''
   Former state Rep. Chuck Sides, a friend of Francke's, said the
corrections chief had shown him a letter threatening his life last
fall. He said he could remember no details of the letter, which
Francke had shrugged off.
   Sides said Francke had told him he was glad to have left the New
Mexico Correction Department because of death threats there.
   But Sides also Francke made comments about death by stabbing
several weeks ago.
   ``I can't remember what brought it up, but he told me exactly how
a person would die with a stab through the heart,'' Sides said.
``Basically, he showed me with his own hand how you would do that.''
   Francke's brother, Patrick Francke Jr., said he doesn't believe
robbery was a motive.
   In an interview from his home in Kansas City, Mo., Patrick
Francke said police appear to have recovered all his brother's
personal effects, including a wallet, credit cards and car keys.
   He also said he can't understand why a robber would single out
his brother, who was 6-foot-3 and weighed more than 200 pounds, as a
target.
   Penn said he can understand the brother's point of view but
insisted that robbery is still a viable motive.
   The district attorney last week gave out a sketchy description of
a man who is believed to have stabbed Francke. Penn said the man had
dark hair and was wearing dark pants and a light coat.
   At the same time, the district attorney said police aren't
getting close to making an arrest in the case.
   ``It was a quick event and the person escaped,'' he said. ``You
generally need to get a break in this kind of case, a tip from the
public or somebody talking.''

<HEAD>New Vice President To Be Under Microscope On First Foreign Trip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, embarking on the
Bush administration's first diplomatic mission, will be under a
microscope this week as the world watches for policy signals from
the new White House and evaluates how Quayle handles his first major
assignment.
   The new vice president's trip to Venezuela and El Salvador will
be his first chance to perform on the international stage since his
elevation from junior senator from Indiana.
   Twenty-two heads of states are expected to be with Quayle in
Caracas on Thursday for the inauguration of Carlos Andres Perez as
president.
   The lineup is expected to include presidents of the five Central
American countries and of the principle Latin debtor nations.
Together, they could present a uniform front on the question of how
the poor nations will handle their huge international debts.
   Quayle is expected to conduct bilateral meetings with about 10 of
the presidents, including at least one or two from Central America
and up to five from South America, said an administration official
close to the planning of Quayle's trip.
   Among those expected to be present he will not meet with: Cuba's
Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega.
   Also expected for the inauguration are Alfredo Cesar and other
representatives of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, who are hoping to
push the other Central American presidents to demand democratization
in Nicaragua.
   Venezuela's biggest inauguration ever will mostly present a
protocol challenge for Quayle, said a U.S. official.
   How he presents himself and the style with which he represents
the United States will be as much a measure of his success as
anything, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``It is important symbolically in that it is one of the more
important meetings of Latin American leaders in the last 10 years,''
the official said.
   Quayle, whose chief legislative accomplishment was a job-training
bill, has been closeted in hours of briefings with State Department
and National Security Council officials and others familiar with the
region.
   He was described by one of the briefers as energetic and eager to
carry out the trip with accomplishment.
   Among those with whom he has met are AFL-CIO officials who are
concerned about human rights in El Salvador, said Quayle's press
secretary, David Beckwith.
   In El Salvador, he will meet with outgoing President Jose
Napoleon Duarte and with other political and military figures,
including representatives of Duarte's Christian Democratic Party and
the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA, party.
   El Salvador, in the stranglehold of a guerrilla war against the
U.S.-backed government for the past nine years, holds elections
March 19. Duarte cannot run again and ARENA's Alfredo Cristiani led
Christian Democratic candidate Fidel Chavez Mena in recent polls.
   Some U.S. officials have expressed concern that a victory by
Cristiani could further polarize the war-torn country and create
stumbling blocks in Congress for getting new aid to the region
passed.
   Quayle's El Salvador visit comes at a volatile time. Duarte
recently rejected a proposal by the rebels in which the rebels
offered to take part in the elections and drop their longstanding
demand for power sharing in a transitional government if the
elections were postponed to September.
   Officials said no diplomatic breakthroughs would be expected of
Quayle, but that his mission would be to show Bush administration
concern for the region's economic and social problems.
   ``The trip is mainly to show our interest in the area and show
our interest in democracy,'' said Beckwith.
   It is also a chance for Quayle to meet the challenge of critics
who during the presidential campaign claimed he was not up to the
job of vice president.
   Quayle is not scheduled to make any speeches during the trip but
will hold press conferences.
   Beyond Quayle's personal performance, the trip puts a spotlight
on Latin America as a region the Bush administration considers
important and world leaders will be watching to see what they can
expect in the way of policy from Bush.
   ``They're all waiting with baited breath to see what signals he
will send,'' on such issues as the debt crisis and the Contra war in
Nicaragua, said one administration official.
   Riddled by massive debt and internal economic disarray, many of
the Latin countries are also plagued by insurgent movements.
   Among them, rebel forces have been entrenched in El Salvador and
Guatemala for years, while guerrilla activity by the radical Shining
Path in Peru also has stepped up.
   Latin American countries owe more than $440 billion of the $1.3
trillion of Third World debt. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are the
biggest Third World debtors, with much of the money owed to U.S.
banks.
   Perez, along with Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gotari,
have been in the forefront of urging relief from the debt burden
that has resulted in net payments of $20 billion to $30 billion a
year from poor countries to richer ones.
   But no definitive policy on Central American debt or the Contra
war has been outlined by the Bush administration.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, as treasury secretary in
1985, proposed $29 billion in new loans to Third World countries
that demonstrate economic reform, but banks did not embrace the
proposal and not much came of it.
   Baker said during his recent Senate confirmation hearing that the
Bush administration will undertake a full review of the debt
situation.
   Baker also signalled the Bush administration's leanings on
Nicaragua, vowing support for the Contras and calling for a
bipartisan Central American policy. He called for human rights
protection in Nicaragua as well as El Salvador and other countries
in the region.
   The Central American presidents are expected to emerge from
Caracas with a date to resume their talks to further the regional
peace plan offered by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.

   ``Fatal Attraction'' star Glenn Close
says she had to change her appearance because of the recognition she
received after her performance in the film as Alex, the enraged
jilted lover.
   ``I was surprised the picture became the phenomenon it did,''
Close said of the film in a recent interview in the Sunday
Tennessean. ``It was amazing.
   ``I even cut my hair because people were jumping out of my way.
My hair stylist says people come in wanting their hair `done like
Glenn Close's.''' Her blond hair was in a distinctive curly style
for the film.
   ``I am kind of an average-looking woman and, until recently, I've
been able to travel around pretty much without hindrance. Alex has
changed all that, too.
   ``I don't think any of us realized how emotional people would be
about `Fatal Attraction' and how much they'd hate my guts and want
to see me blown away.
   ``I was very upset when I heard that people applauded when the
faithful wife said, `If you come near my family, I'll kill you,' To
me, as I knew the Alex character, she was extremely tragic. All that
was taken away in the final version.''

   Neil Diamond concerts scheduled this
week at the Palace of Auburn Hills have lost some of their luster
for some security personnel and some fans, especially those in the
high-priced seats.
   A memorandum warning the holders of the 180 luxury private boxes
or suites in the arena they ``need to close all (rear) draperies,
turn off all lights and TV's and remain seated in their terraces
throughout the concert,'' was issued last week by Thomas Trzos,
director of facility administration. It was sent at Diamond's
request.
   Those suites, many with televisions for sports fans to take in
their instant replays, go for $30,000 to $120,000 a year. But the
occupants could be ejected if they violate Diamond's requests, the
memo said.
   The memo also said the doors would not open until about 6:45 p.m.
because Diamond has demanded that no employees, suiteholders or fans
be allowed to peek into the arena during preparation for the
elaborate show. Concerts start at 8 p.m.
   Sherrie Levy, Diamond's publicist, said his requests may have
been taken out of context.

   Edwin Meese III, the former controversial
attorney general, has found sanctuary of sorts in his new role as a
visiting scholar with the Hoover Institution.
   Meese praised the social policies of the Reagan administration
and championed the cause of public service in a speech on Saturday.
   ``Lest any of you are confused by stereotypes in the news media,
it will be the 1990s we're talking about, not the 1980s,'' Meese
said, sidestepping the potential for discussion of his embattled
tenure in the Reagan administration. He spoke to a crowd of about
400 attending an ``Issues in the '90s'' conference.
   During a break, Meese said he will spend his two-year, part-time
stint as a ``distinguished visiting scholar'' at the conservative
think tank by focusing on Reagan.
   Meese resigned as attorney general last March, following an
investigation into whether he used his political influence for
personal gain. Special prosecutor James C. McKay concluded that
Meese probably had violated federal conflict-of-interest and tax
laws, but he decided not to prosecute.

   John le Carre's next book isn't expected in
bookstores until June, but fans are already wondering whether the
new Soviet spirit of glasnost will bring the acclaimed spy novelist
in from the cold.
   The question is tantalizing enough to have made the front page of
the respected Sunday Telegraph, which asked: ``If the creator of
(British spycatcher George) Smiley and of Karla, the Soviet
spymaster, has had to come in from the Cold War, what front will he
fight on?''
   Novels like ``Smiley's People'' and the ``The Spy Who Came in
From the Cold,'' whose undercover skullduggery is set in the
pre-Mikhail Gorbachev era, have made le Carre a master of the genre.
   His upcoming latest novel, ``The Russia House,'' is described in
his publisher's catalog as ``a spy story and an anti-spy story, a
story of Cold Warriors who continue to dance in their gray cellars
after the music has ended,'' The Sunday Telegraph reported.

the moon from 1968 to 1972, was the big winner at this year's United
States Film Festival.
   The movie captured both the Audience Award and the Grand Jury
Prize as best documentary Saturday at the 11th annual festival held
in Park City Jan. 20 through Sunday. The festival fosters
independent films.
   Producer-director Al Reinert finished the film just one week ago,
the same day it had its first screening at the event, sponsored by
Robert Redford's Sundance Institute and the Utah Film Development
Office.
   ``I'm a writer,'' Reinert said after receiving the two awards.
``I just wandered into filmmaking 10 years ago. I was just amazed no
one made this film 10 years before that. I always thought going to
the moon was our highest pyramid. This is the most extraordinary
stuff ever shot by human beings.''
   Reinert received $5,000 for winning the Grand Jury Prize, as did
director Nancy Savoca, whose film ``True Love'' captured the same
prize in the dramatic category.
   ``True Love,'' set in an Italian-American neighborhood of New
York City's borough of the Bronx, tells the story of a young
couple's final weeks preparing for marriage and their relationships
with family and friends.
   A new category at this year's festival was the Filmmaker's
Trophy, given to the best films as voted by the competition's
filmmakers themselves.
   The filmmakers' choice for best documentary was ``John Huston.''
Narrated by actor Robert Mitchum, the movie by Frank Martin and Joni
Levin followed the life and career of the late director who made
such films as ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``The Dead,'' ``The Treasure
of the Sierre Madre,'' and ``The Man Who Would Be King.''
   The Audience Award in the dramatic category went to ``sex, lies
and videotape,'' which also received its first screening at the
festival.
   A psychological drama by first-time director Steven Soderbergh,
the film revolves around the soured relationship of a married
couple, which Soderbergh patterned after a relationship of his own.
   ``I thought our audience was going to be very small. It is so
personal that I didn't think anyone would relate to it,'' he said.
   Winner of the Filmmakers' dramatic Award was ``Powwow Highway,''
a comedy-drama about two young Northern Cheyenne Indians who take a
journey of self-discovery across uhe American plains. It was
directed by Jonathan Wacks.

<HEAD>Iran Hangs 22 More Drug Smugglers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>

   Iran hanged 22 drug smugglers in the past
three days, raising to 130 the number of people executed in an
anti-narcotics crackdown this month, Tehran Radio reported Sunday.
   Smugglers are hanged in public in the early hours. Their bodies
are left hanging to emphasize to morning rush-hour crowds the
government's determination to stamp out drug addiction.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said seven smugglers were
hanged in northeastern Khorasan province, six in the capital,
Tehran, and the rest in cities throughout the country.
   Those hanged in Khorasan were Afghan citizens found with 163
pounds of opium and 8.8 pounds of heroin, the radio said.
   The Afghans also were charged with illegal entry into Iran,
possessing weapons and resisting arrest in a shootout with
government agents. The radio did not say if there were any
casualties in the clash.
   Officials seized more than 33,000 pounds of opium, 213 pounds of
heroin, and 22 pounds of morphine from the other smugglers, it said.
   The executions began two weeks ago after a new law mandated death
for anyone found in possession of even small amounts of narcotics,
or found guilty of causing widespread drug addiction.
   Hangings will be suspended for 10 days from Feb. 1 during
celebrations marking the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution that
toppled the Iranian monarchy in 1979, the government has announced.
   About 1,500 people have been arrested in the crackdown.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said
1 million of Iran's 50 million people are believed to abuse drugs.
   It said the price of heroin has risen dramatically since the
start of the crackdown, but it did not give prices.

<HEAD>Senate Panel to Begin Hearings on Indian Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee begins hearings this week to
lay out the results of an investigation of alleged improprieties in
federal Indian programs, a yearlong, 600-witness inquiry that panel
leaders say could lead to criminal prosecutions.
   The allegations of corruption, fraud and waste in federal Indian
programs were aired initially in a series of articles by The Arizona
Republic.
   All evidence of criminal wrongdoing will be handed over to the
Justice Department, said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., head of the
special committee formed in October 1987 following the newspaper
articles.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also are
on the committee.
   DeConcini and McCain told the Republic's Washington bureau the
initial two weeks of hearings will bring to a close the inquiry's
first phase.
   After initial testimony on the U.S. government treaty's
obligations to Indians, the first week of hearings will be dominated
by examples of abuses and fraud in federal programs designed to
encourage the government to contract with Indian-owned firms for
construction projects on reservations and for providing supplies to
Indians, DeConcini said.
   Owners of companies have offered bribes of cars, trips and money
to Indian leaders and Small Business Administration officials to win
contracts, DeConcini said.
   DeConcini declined to provide specifics, saying they would be
disclosed during the hearings.
   A second round of hearings, slated to begin this spring, will
investigate fraud in Indian-resource programs.
   Senate investigators have found that large companies bilked
taxpayers and Indians of undisclosed amounts by outright theft of
resources and by underpaying royalties for oil, gas, minerals and
timber from Indian lands, DeConcini said.
   But he said investigators have not yet uncovered what The
Republic's series reported was billions of dollars in theft of
resources or underreporting of production volumes, done to lower
royalty payments.
   DeConcini said the ongoing resources inquiry has been slowed by
shoddy record keeping by the Interior Department, of which the
Bureau of Indian Affairs is a part.
   He said record keeping is so lax investigators have been forced
to piece together contracts and production levels by cross-checking
them with documents at resource companies and associations.
   DeConcini and McCain stressed that corruption is not the central
focus of the investigation.
   ``We want to highlight the problems for American people, who
don't know or don't care, about a significant portion of the
population which lives under vastly different conditions than the
majority of other Americans,'' McCain said.
   McCain, discussing allegations of child abuse at Indian schools,
said Senate investigators will show that federal officials
repeatedly fail to make even cursory background checks of
prospective teachers. The Senate inquiry also found that indian
affairs officials have resisted investigating charges of abuse, he
said.
   DeConcini said investigators also have solid evidence that
organized crime figures have infiltrated Indian gaming operations,
using coercion and ``a heavy hand.''
   ``The bingo area has been a real invitation to organized crime,''
DeConcini said, adding that the hearings will look into ``the
inability or unwillingness of tribal leaders to resist'' and
inadequate laws and enforcement.
   Officials said the Senate inquiry has taken investigators to 30
states. More than 900,000 pages of documents have been reviewed and
more than 600 people interviewed.
   The panel has subpoenaed more than 270 people and, after
consulting with the Justice Department, granted immunity to an
undisclosed number, including Indian aides and contracting company
owners, The Republic said.

   Police said Sunday they were looking for

   U.S. Embassy spokesman Ross Petzing said Robert S. Cookson, a

his 35-year-old Thai wife, Lawan, dead and the child injured.
   Police said the embassy had asked authorities not to disclose

   The child, Jennifer, was being treated in a hospital for
second-degree burns, he said.

   Fifty angry elephants invaded a remote
forest village twice last week and destroyed several huts while
searching for a missing elephant calf, United News of India reported
Sunday.
   The calf had fallen into a 23-foot-deep well when the herd was
being chased by Forest Department workers in the Salboni forest, 70
miles west of Calcutta, the news agency said. The workers were
trying to shoo away the herd that had arrived in the area two months
ago, damaging crops and frightening villagers.
   The elephant calf was trapped in the well for 24 hours while
villagers prevented forest workers from rescuing it, UNI said.
   In the meantime, the elephant herd thundered into the village in
search of the calf, UNI said. No one was injured during the
elephants' two forays, but residents fled from their houses, the
news agency said.
   The villagers subsequently permitted Forest Department workers to
rescue the calf. The elephants resisted further attempts to chase
them out of the region. UNI's report from the remote area did not
give the village's name.

<TEXT>
   Authorities Sunday blamed a travel iron
with a faulty cord, which a guest had plugged into a socket, for
starting a hotel fire that killed three people and injured 14 others.
   Fire Marshal William Reinhard said at a news conference that the
126-room Hotel Bethlehem passed inspection three months ago.
   The fire started shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday after guest Murial
Brooks, of Croton Falls, N.Y., plugged the iron into the electrical
socket and a chair caught fire, Ms. Brooks and officials said.
   The blaze spread to a second room on the fifth floor, but was
confined to those two rooms in the nine-story building, Fire
Commissioner Carmen Oliver said. The fire was out by noon.
   About 20 of the 190 guests at the hotel Friday night were elderly
people staying there while a nearby retirement housing complex was
being renovated. At least 100 rooms were occupied by people
attending a convention for the Music Teachers National Association,
according to Dee Decker, who owns the hotel with her husband, Robert.
   Officials identified the dead as Monique Forbes, 58, who lived at
the hotel; and John Kelly, 75, and Charles R. Knouse, 69, who were
staying at the hotel while the retirement home was being renovated.
   Five of 14 people treated at hospitals remained there Sunday,
officials said. Three of the five, all over age 65, were in critical
condition.
   The Deckers said four employees knocked on guests' doors to alert
them to the fire. Although several guests said they did not hear
fire alarms, Mrs. Decker said the employees told her the alarms were
sounding.
   David Lloyd, city emergency medical services supervisor, said the
number of injuries probably was reduced because of the quick
reaction of residents.
   ``It didn't look like panic,'' Lloyd said. ``The people were very
calm for what they had been through. ... They deserve some credit
for that. These people were thinking.''
   The Deckers bought the hotel _ built on the same site as
Bethlehem's first house was built in 1741 _ from Bethlehem Steel
Corp. in 1984 and said they updated the fire system then. They
estimated damage in the millions of dollars.

<TEXT>
   The head of a bankrupt munitions company
says an Army recommendation to detonate some of the plant's
explosives on the spot rather than risk moving them is unnecessary
because there is no danger of an accidental blast.
   Lakeland residents have nothing to fear, said Edward Geoghegan,
who was chief executive officer when Sooner Defense of Florida Inc.
filed for protection from its creditors July 19. The company is
being liquidated by a federal bankruptcy court.
   ``I know one thing, I'd be willing to take myself and my family
out there and I'll go look in the buildings,'' he said Friday. ``The
only thing I cannot speak to is what the government has done since
they've been out there.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Thomas Baynes, who is presiding over
the Sooner proceedings, had asked the government to remove any
hazardous materials from the plant, which made fuses to detonate
other explosives for the military.
   An Army explosives expert, Capt. Kurt Ponting, inspected the site
and testified Wednesday that one or two small buildings at the plant
a few miles west of Lakeland should be blown up. He said he will
head a special team to decide which explosives can be moved and
which should be detonated.
   Ponting's principal concern was over a compound called lead
azide, described in chemical textbooks as a severe explosion risk.
It was usually placed for an hour or two in drying ovens about the
size of outhouses, but some has been in a couple of ovens ever since
the plant closed, officials said.
   ``Certainly there are dangerous explosives out there, there's no
doubt about that,'' Geoghegan conceded. But he added: ``I would
match Sooner's handling of explosives against any ammunition company
in the whole country. We were the best.''
   Until the hearing, even government attorneys had been saying it
would be a relatively simple and short process to remove the
explosives, said Robert Soriano, attorney for Citizens Fidelity Bank
and Trust of Louisville, Ky., Sooner's largest secured creditor.
   Told of the Army proposal, Don Seeger, a former Sooner explosives
expert, said, ``I'd have to see it, but it sounds like a drastic
move to blow the material in place when it's only been in storage
six months.''
   Trustee Daniel Bakst, who was appointed by Baynes in December to
liquidate the company, said: ``I agree with Geoghegan that it's
blown out of proportion.''
   Ponting estimates it will cost the government up to $1 million
and take up to four months to remove all explosives.

<DATELINE>ALONG THE SALANG HIGHWAY, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan troops and
Moslem guerrillas fought for control of this highway Sunday as the
Soviet army moved out what may have been the last convoy to leave
Afghanistan by truck.
   A convoy of Soviet soldiers driving armored personnel carriers
and trucks loaded with missile launchers and other equipment cruised
through a Soviet bunker checkpoint as helicopter gunships hovered
nearby, offering cover.
   The highway, the only road to the Soviet border, winds through
mountains where the rebels are waiting for the Red Army to complete
its withdrawal.
   Two ground-attack jets streaked overhead and then disappeared
behind the snow-covered mountains just beyond the hills surrounding
the capital of Kabul.
   ``This could be the last convoy,'' said a Soviet diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. He refused to elaborate.
   Rebels based in Pakistan reported Sunday that Soviet bombing and
missile attacks along the highway have killed 600 civilians and
injured 1,200.
   ``The mangled bodies are still under the debris,'' the Afghan New
Agency said in a telexed statement. It was unclear whether the
agency, operated from Pakistan by a rebel group, was repeating a
similar report it made Saturday.
   Official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan, said
Sunday night that Afghan troops had carried out ``successful
military operations'' with civilians who want to keep the 260-mile
Salang Highway open.
   ``The inhabitants of the Salang Highway assisted the forces, as
they hate the robbers, and complete security has been restored on
the highway,'' it said.
   At a Soviet checkpoint about 12 miles north of Kabul on Sunday,
Afghan soldiers paced nervously along the highway.
   Soviet soldiers in the convoy looked bored.
   ``How's everything going?'' one Afghan officer was asked.
   ``Very bad,'' he said.
   Earlier Sunday, Afghan soldiers said, the rebels, known as
Mujahedeen, fired on a convoy of about 350 trucks carrying flour,
eggs, diesel fuel, gasoline and other supplies down the highway to
Kabul. One driver, an Afghan, was slightly injured by a bullet that
grazed his leg, they said.
   When asked what would happen when the Soviets are gone, an
officer said: ``The Mujahedeen.''
   Tass reported Sunday that a Soviet delegation led by Yuri
Maslyukov, a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo, arrived in
Kabul.
   Maslyukov, Finance Minister Boris Gostev and Minister for
External Economic Konstantin Katushev met with Afghan President
Najib to discuss Soviet economic aid to Afghanistan, the official
Soviet news agency said.
   It said the discussion focused on how the Soviet Union would help
the Afghans ``thwart the opposition's plans to establish an economic
blockade of the capital'' and that Moscow would supply food, fuel
``and essentials.''
   In Pakistan, Western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity
said that in the past week an average of 18 Soviet transport planes
a day had landed and taken off from Kabul _ more than twice the
number reported the previous week.
   The aircraft deliver arms and food to the beleaguered city, then
depart with hundreds of Soviet soldiers, the diplomats said.
   The Soviets sent about 115,000 troops into Afghanistan in
December 1979 to prop up a Marxist government that seized power in a
coup the previous year.
   The Red Army began pulling out eight months ago under an
agreement sponsored by the United Nations to end the nine-year
intervention.
   Soviet diplomats in Kabul say the remaining 15,000 to 20,000
troops could be gone by the end of the week, about 10 days before
the U.N. deadline. The remaining soldiers apparently were to leave
on transport planes.
   The guerrillas are not a party to the U.N. agreement and have
vowed to overthrow Najib's government once the Soviets are gone.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein agreed Sunday to a
U.N. proposal to set up a joint military committee with Iran,
Baghdad Radio said.
   Diplomats in the Iraqi capital said it is a significant
breakthrough in U.N. efforts to revive stalled peace talks to end
the eight-year gulf war.
   The radio did not elaborate on the committee's function.
   But the diplomats, who requested anonymity, said a joint military
group signaled hopes of a troop withdrawal by both sides. The group
could work with U.N. military observers monitoring the Aug. 20
cease-fire, they said.
   Iraq's and Iran's failure to agree on a withdrawal, called for
under a July 1987 Security Council resolution, has been a major
sticking point in talks that have dragged on inconclusively for five
months.
   State-owned Baghdad Radio said Saddam agreed to the joint
committee during a four-hour meeting Sunday with Jan Eliasson,
special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Eliasson, Sweden's ambassador to the United Nations, arrived in
Baghdad Friday after four days of talks with Iranian leaders in
Tehran.
   Iraq's broadcast said Saddam also agreed to lift a ban barring
Iranian-bound civilian flights from flying over Iraq.
   The radio did not elaborate. But Saddam appears to be making an
effort to give new impetus to the stalled negotiations.
   Talks broke down in Geneva on Nov. 11. Iran says it considers
further talks futile unless Iraq halts what it calls delaying
tactics.
   Baghdad Radio reported that Saddam reiterated to Eliasson that
Iraq rejects any Iranian preconditions to resuming negotiations.
   Iran says that before it returns to the negotiating table, Iraq
must agree to the complete and immediate implementation of the
Security Council resolution, including withdrawing troops to the
prewar border.
   Baghdad Radio said Saddam agreed to participate in the joint
military committee and to lift the flight ban ``out of Iraq's
keenness for the U.N. envoy's mission to succeed and its readiness
to cooperate with him.''
   Saddam called on Iran to display the same commitment to the
United Nations resolution ``through practical steps and deeds,'' the
radio reported.
   A spokesman for the U.N. mission, Gianni Picco, declined comment
on Sunday's developments.
   Iran charges Iraq is blocking agreement by refusing to withdraw
from 260 square miles of Iranian border territory captured in final
stages of the fighting. Iraq says it will not withdraw until Iran
agrees to surrender its right to search ships in the gulf for
Iraq-bound war materiel.
   The two sides also dispute ownership of the Shatt-Al-Arab
waterway, their prewar southern boundary.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, under fire for its
handling of the Libyan scandal, will impose much harsher penalties
for illegal exports of materials that could be used to make chemical
weapons, a newspaper said Sunday.
   Also Sunday, a magazine reported that nuclear materials that
originated in the United States were sent to India through a West
German company in 1984, and suggested they could have been used to
make atomic weapons.
   West German authorities are investigating several companies
linked to shipments for a Libyan plant that U.S. officials say was
designed to make chemical weapons. Libyan officials say the plant
will make pharmaceuticals.
   Some U.S. congressmen say West German officials looked the other
way while German companies made possibly illegal exports to Libya
and other countries.
   The West German government says it plans to stiffen export
controls to hinder shipment of material that could be used for
chemical and atomic weapons.
   The newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, released what it said were
details of those plans, saying they are contained in a ``secret
paper'' the government will present to Parliament. It did not say
when.
   According to the newspaper, the government wants to double the
maximum fine for such violations from $273,000 to $546,000 and to
increase the maximum jail sentence from three years to five.
   A key part of the proposal would be changing current law to allow
seizure of any profits made from illegal sales, the newspaper said.
   The West German inquiries also center on allegations that German
companies helped Iraq with its chemical weapons program and on
suspicions that sensitive nuclear materials were delivered to
Pakistan.
   Iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons during its war with
Iran, and reports say Pakistan has the ability to make nuclear
weapons.
   West German leaders have denied U.S. allegations they were too
slow in launching investigations against suspected violators of
export laws. Meanwhile, more allegations are cropping up weeks after
the Libyan scandal first broke.
   In editions to appear Monday, Der Spiegel magazine said the West
German company Degussa sent 210 pounds of beryllium to India in 1984
and that a ``large part of this material originated in the U.S.A.''
   Der Spiegel said it based its report on unidentified documents to
which the magazine had obtained access.
   Beryllium frequently is used in nuclear reactors. Der Spiegel
said it can also be used in the production of atomic weapons.
   The magazine said Degussa served as middleman in the shipment.
The news magazine did not identify the American parties allegedly
involved.
   ``The transaction occurred at a time when there were worldwide
rumors that India was developing an atomic bomb,'' the magazine said.
   According to Der Spiegel, the material was sent to the Bhabha
Atomic Research Center near Bombay.
   The magazine said West German authorities approved the permits
because the government did not believe the exports would help India
build nuclear weapons.
   Neither government nor Degussa officials could be reached for
comment Sunday night.
   In a separate article, the magazine said West German intelligence
officials knew ``for a long time'' of German shipments to Iraq of
chemicals that could be used to make biological weapons.
   But according to the magazine, the intelligence officials did not
inform the West German chancellor's office of what it knew ``until
the worldwide uproar over German shipments to Libya.''

   A bomb exploded Sunday outside a government
official's home, and police said they suspected radicals opposed to
expansion of Tokyo's international airport.
   Neither Katsuhisa Kamijo, 78, acting chairman of the Council for
Public Land Use, nor his wife were injured, said an official of the
Kanagawa Prefectural Police, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blast, the official said.
   He said a lawn shed and the kitchen of Kamijo's two-story wooden
house were damaged by the explosion. Police found bits of a timer
that might have triggered the blast, the official said.
   Because of Kamijo's position, the attack could have been the work
of radicals who oppose the planned expansion of the airport at
Narita, 40 miles northeast of Tokyo, the official said.
   The council oversees land acquisition for public use, including
the expropriation of farmland to build an additional runway at the
$2.5 billion airport, which opened in 1978.
   Local farmers have opposed the move, and radical leftists have
taken up the cause.

   Neighbors play touch football, the
pizza delivery van makes its rounds and people who drive too fast
get tickets _ from sheriff's deputies aboard snowmobiles.
   For three months each year, just 10 miles from downtown St. Paul,
hundreds of people sit on the frozen White Bear Lake for hours, even
days at a time. Some are outside, others are snug in fish houses,
makeshift structures to protect anglers from the wind, warmed by
wood stoves or propane heaters.
   By mid-January, nearly 350 plywood shacks are scattered across
the lake, most clumped into several small villages. Rutted roads
lead to populated points on the ice, fanning out from about six
points on the shore. A speed limit of 35 mph is enforced by
sheriff's deputies on their snowmobiles.
   The shacks are grouped into villages for several reasons: safety
from vandalism, easy access from the main roads and the belief that
if everyone else is fishing at a certain spot, it must be good.
   But the community disappears each spring when the nearly two feet
of ice underneath it melts.
   Brad Stanius, a legislator from White Bear Lake and a well-known
angler, said he can't set up a permanent house on the lake or
hundreds of people would drill their fishing holes nearby.
   ``They'd assume I know the right spots,'' he said. He uses a
portable house instead that can be set up in minutes.
   In one corner of Steve Bruski's house near shore are his
provisions: doughnuts, chocolate milk and a couple of cans of Pepsi.
An 18-by-24-inch fishing hole is in another corner.
   Bruski, of St. Paul, and his friends keep two snowmobiles nearby
so they can dash around the lake when the fishing is slow. On White
Bear, there's always a flurry of non-fishing social activity.
   Four-wheel-drive vehicles and snowmobiles race by at all hours.
Cross-country skiers glide past silently. Planes fly low over the
lake to check out the action.
   Domino's delivers pizzas on the ice during the day, but won't go
out at night because drivers have trouble identifying specific
dwellings.
   Rich VonDeLinde and Jim Fincel like to come out on New Year's Day
and Super Bowl Sunday, hook a television set to a battery and watch
the games.
   VonDeLinde built his house several years ago, using discarded
office partitions. There's a propane heater against one wall, a coat
rack and a shelf near the door, light green carpeting on the wooden
floor. It's larger than most shacks, about 12 by 6 feet.
   A skylight in the ceiling is the latest improvement. There are
plans for two electric lights next year, to be powered by a marine
battery.
   When they're waiting for the fish to bite, VonDeLinde and Fincel
play cribbage atop a plywood sheet over a plastic bucket.
   Last week, the news spread quickly when someone pulled a big
northern pike out of the lake.
   Ken Matheson at the bait shop heard it was a 28-pounder.
Twenty-six, said an angler in the village of icehouses just north of
Manitou Island. ``About 20 pounds is what I heard,'' said a spear
fisherman near Bellaire Beach.
   Maybe it was actually a 15-pounder that grew and grew in the
telling. It doesn't really matter to the citizenry on the lake.
   ``Legends _ that's what's fishing's all about,'' said Matheson.
``It's 10 percent fishing and 90 percent talking.''

   A Palestinian leader jailed without trial
through most of the 13-month uprising in the occupied lands was
freed Sunday and said he envisions direct talks soon between Israel
and the PLO.
   ``I believe that they (the Israelis) have decided that their
enemy is the PLO and who do you make peace with but your enemy?''
said Faisal Husseini.
   Husseini, who met in jail recently with Israeli government
officials, predicted progress in the next few months toward
resolving the conflict, but he refused to elaborate.
   He told reporters he believes the Palestine Liberation
Organization will support a U.N.-backed referendum on statehood for
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, but not elections for local
representatives as suggested by some Israeli leaders.
   Husseini, 48, is considered the most powerful pro-PLO leader in
the occupied lands.
   In the occupied territories, meanwhile, hospital officials
reported 12 Palestinians were wounded by Israeli soldiers who fired
at stone-throwing youths Sunday. The army confirmed six casualties.
   It said troops in the Gaza Strip sealed the homes of six
Palestinians accused of attacking soldiers and Arabs suspected of
collaborating with Israel. In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, troops
detained about 70 Arabs suspected of rioting, Israel army radio said.
   In the West Bank's largest city, Nablus, leaflets appeared for
the first time signed by the Arab Socialist Baath Party, the party
of President Hafez Assad in Syria, Arab reporters said.
   The leaflets condemned U.S. imperialism and said Palestinians who
favor elections are playing into Israel's hands. ``The only language
that the enemy understands is the thug's language,'' they said.
   Later Sunday, the Defense Ministry said Husseini met last week in
his prison cell with Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's top adviser,
Shmuel Goren, and discussed the occupied territories. Israel radio
reported Rabin briefed the Cabinet on the talks.
   Husseini refused to directly confirm the meeting but said ``I
prefer if Mr. Goren speaks first.''
   Husseini denied Israeli media reports that he would serve as an
intermediary between Israel and the PLO.
   ``I don't know why they need an intermediary,'' he said. ``What
is the difference if Faisal Husseini is a messenger or they have
direct contacts?''
   Husseini noted that Israelis, even some in the government, are
more open to the Palestinian guerrilla movement since PLO leader
Yasser Arafat recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.
   ``Some of the Israelis in the high levels of the government are
going in a new way which I believe is in the right direction,'' he
told Israel radio, taking the unusual step of speaking Hebrew.
   Cabinet Minister Ezer Weizmann said Friday that Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir should end the ban on talking to the PLO. On Sunday,
Israel radio quoted Shamir as saying that Israel is ready to
negotiate with Palestinians but not the PLO.
   Shamir also has called Rabin's recent suggestion on elections an
unofficial proposal and said the government still is formulating its
peace initiative.
   Rabin plans to hold further meetings with Palestinians on his
proposal, hoping to shift the focus of attention from the PLO to
local leaders in the occupied lands, Israel television reported.
   Husseini was believed imprisoned to control the uprising. He was
never tried and said he was not informed of charges against him.
   ``They gave me no evidence and said it was all in a secret
file,'' he said.
   Also Sunday, Israel agreed to raise the Egyptian flag over the
disputed Taba border area. It was a symbolic concession reflecting
Israel's plans to return the 250-acre beach strip to Egyptian rule
and an attempt to restart talks toward resolving the issue, the
Foreign Ministry said.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Releases Breakdown Showing `Rough Parity' With NATO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on Monday released a
breakdown of its conventional forces in Europe that it said shows
``rough parity'' with NATO forces.
   But a Moscow-based Western diplomat said the alliance appeared to
have tailored the categories of forces to support its position that
it is roughly equal in strength with the West.
   The breakdown came in a statement by the Warsaw Pact's Defense
Ministers Committee and reported by the Tass news agency.
   The statement did not contain numbers of troops and weapons but
said that when it is published Monday in the Communist Party daily
Pravda, the document will be accompanied by ``several tables and
explanations concerning them.''
   Monday's editions of Pravda were not immediately available but
the broad outlines contained in the statement differed sharply from
NATO reckonings.
   In the statement, the Warsaw Pact said the numerical strengths of
the two military alliances' ground and air forces ``are roughly
equal.'' But, it added that U.S.-led NATO has twice as many naval
personnel as its Eastern counterpart.
   The statement also said:
   _NATO has more frontline or tactical strike aircraft, maritime
strike aircraft, combat helicopters and anti-tank rocket systems.
   _The Warsaw Pact has an advantage in tanks, tactical missile
launchers, interceptor warplanes of air defense forces, combat
infrantry vehicles, armored personnel carriers and artillery.
   _NATO ``enjoys a considerable margin of superiority'' in naval
warplanes and large surface ships such as aircraft carriers.
   _The Eastern alliance ``has a certain advantage'' in submarines
armed with missiles and torpedoes.
   Both sides are to sit down in Vienna on March 7 to discuss the
issues in Negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.
   The talks were given a boost Dec. 7 when Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev announced the Kremlin would reduce the Red Army by a
500,000 troops by 1991. Moscow also says it will reduce its weapons
by 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat planes.
   Following Moscow's lead, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, East Germany and Poland have announced cuts in their own
military forces.
   NATO officials, citing what they say is Warsaw Pact superiority,
have said it would be unwise for the Western alliance to reduce its
armed forces in response to the Eastern cuts.
   NATO contends the Soviets have a 2-to-1 manpower edge and 3-to-1
tank advantage. The new Warsaw Pact statement, however, says that
overall the two sides are close.
   ``The military balance in Europe, considering all its
ingredients, can be described as a rough parity which does not give
a possibility to either side to count on a decisive military
advantage,'' the statement said.
   It added that there is still a need to reduce forces in Europe
``to ensure stability corresponding to the principle of reasonable
defensive sufficiency.''
   The Western diplomat contended that broad assertions such as
those in the Warsaw Pact statement are largely meaningless unless
backed up by specific figures and definitions of what is included in
each category of forces.

<HEAD>More Rain For Southern And Eastern Texas, Cold In Alaska</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain soaked parts of Texas on Sunday, prompting flash flood
alerts, while strong, gusty wind whipped parts of the West and
unusually cold weather continued in Alaska.
   A cold front moving slowly across eastern and south-central Texas
produced showers and a few thunderstorms with locally heavy rain. A
flash flood watch was in effect into the night for southeastern and
parts of south-central Texas.
   In south-central Texas, more than 3 inches of rain was reported
near the Bexar, Kendall, Bandera and Medina county lines from early
morning into the afternoon. Thunderstorms continued across the
region during the afternoon.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included, 2.80 inches of
rain fell at Palacios, and 0.96 of an inch fell at the airport at
Houston.
   Clouds, fog and light rain were scattered from the southern
Plains into the lower Great Lakes, with snow scattered across parts
of central Wisconsin into northern Lower Michigan. Much of the
dreary weather was ahead of an upper level area of low pressure that
extended from the southern Rockies into the central Plains.
   A large area of high pressure over the Great Basin of Nevada and
western Utah generated the easterly wind known as the Santa Ana over
southern California. Wind speeds of 25 to 35 mph were reported
across the region during the morning. A wind advisory was posted
through Monday for the southern California mountains, the lower
Colorado River Valley and in the intermediate valleys near canyons
across southern California.
   The steep change in pressure between that high and a low over
northern Manitoba channeled gusty westerly wind over the northern
Rockies in Montana. Gusts of 30 to 40 mph were clocked along the
eastern slopes of the Rockies, with gusts of 50 to 70 mph reported
during the night. A high wind warning was posted through Monday for
the eastern slopes of the Montana Rockies and the lower Yellowstone
Valley.
   In Alaska, cold air that normally circulates in the polar region
continued to affect the central and northern parts of the state,
thanks to a ridge of high pressure over the Bering Strait region.
   Low temperatures in Alaska early Sunday included 63 below zero at
McGrath, 58 below at Bettles, 53 below at Dillingham, 52 below at
Nenana, 49 below at Northway, 48 below at Barrow and Fairbanks, and
46 below at Delta Junction.
   Elsewhere, Maine got a foretaste of spring with a record high of
48 at Portland.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees at Jackson, Wyo., to 83 at Cross City, Fla. Sunday morning's
low in the 48 contiguous state was 12 degrees below zero at Alamosa,
Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers were forecast from southern Texas
through the lower Mississippi Valley and the central Gulf Coast into
the southern half of the Atlantic Coast. Widespread snow was
forecast over the northern and eastern parts of the Great Lakes into
New England.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted across northern Maine and
southern Idaho; in the 30s from northern Minnesota across the
northern Great Lakes region and central New England, and in the
central Intermountain region between the Sierra Nevada and the
Rockies; in the 60s from the central California coast across the
southern Intermountain, from the lower Mississippi Valley to the
Carolina coast, and over parts of the central high Plains; in the
70s along the southern California coast, and from the central Gulf
Coast across northern Florida to the southern Atlantic Coast; in the
lower 80s across southern Florida; and in the 40s or 50s across much
of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Israel agreed on Sunday to let Egypt raise its
flag over the disputed Taba border area in a symbolic concession
reflecting Israel's plans to return the 250-acre beach strip to
Egyptian rule.
   Israel acceded to Egypt's request to fly its flag in an attempt
to get talks moving on the last obstacles before the land along the
Red Sea is handed back, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel.
   ``We hope this decision will help defuse the tensions that have
been created in the past few days and enable the working committees
to resume their talks,'' Liel said.
   He said Egypt's ambassador to Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny, was
pleased by Israel's response.
   Late Sunday, Egypt issued a presidential decree authorizing its
Tourism Ministry to negotiate compensation for Israeli property
owners in Taba, Israel radio said. Israeli officials termed the
document ``moderate'' and said they will study it, the radio
reported.
   The talks over Taba ran into trouble last week when Egyptian
officials said they would consider the land to be under Egypt's
sovereignty as of Sunday, 60 days after an international arbitration
panel sided with Egypt.
   The declaration alarmed Israeli officials, who first want to
settle issues such as access for Israeli tourists and compensation
for Israeli owners of a luxury hotel and a holiday resort village in
Taba.
   The beach strip, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war,
has been a subject of dispute between the countries since 1982. At
that time, Israel refused to return it to Egypt along with the rest
of the Sinai Peninsula under the terms of the nations' 1979 peace
treaty.
   In 1986, the two sides agreed to take the dispute to an
international arbitration panel in Geneva for a binding ruling. The
panel drew a border that put Taba in Egyptian territory.
   Liel said Egypt is to raise its flag on its side of the border
marker, about 150 yards from the Gulf of Aqaba, and Israel is to do
the same on its side.

<HEAD>Famed Anthropolgist May Rejoin Kenya Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anthropologist Richard Leakey said on
Sunday he has been asked to return as director of the National
Museums of Kenya, a post he resigned a week ago.
   But he said he will await a formal offer from the board of
trustees before he agrees to return. ``Until then I'll stay in my
shamba (farm),'' he said.
   Leakey resigned on Jan. 20 to ``facilitate the reorganization
currently being carried out by the Ministry of Home Affairs,'' he
said at the time.
   The 45-year-old son anthropologist said in a press release that
the ministry had appointed a new board of trustees for the museum _
which houses Africa's best collection of fossils and human artifacts
_ without consulting him.
   He said Sunday that the situation is confusing and that he was
waiting for the government to dissolve the new board and reinstate
the previous one.
   ``There can't be two boards,'' Leakey said. ``The ministry did
not say the board it had appointed had been dissolved. But the old
board had not been legally dissolved either.''
   Last month, a Nairobi newspaper, The Standard, quoted unnamed
museum employees as blaming Leakey for an exodus of African
scientists from the institution, which has a staff of 300. But
museum employees later signed a public letter defending their
director.
   A Kenya citizen, Leakey is a high school dropout who learned
anthropolgy from two pioneers: his parents, Louis and Mary. He had
headed the museum for 20 years.
   In 1972, Leakey found a skull of a man-like creature while
leading an expedition near Lake Turkana in northwestern Kenya.
   The skull was later established to be at least 2.5 million years
old, pushing mankind's prehistoric family tree back at least a
million years.
   Until Richard's 1972 discovery, the oldest precusor of man was
thought to date back 1.5 million years, based on discoveries made by
his father 14 years earlier.

   Unidentified guerrillas attacked
Israeli-backed militiamen with rockets and machine-gun fire in south
Lebanon on Sunday, wounding four militiamen, police reported.
   A police spokesman said the guerrillas attacked a patrol of the
South Lebanon Army in the village of Nabi Taher, inside Israel's
self-designated security zone.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said the militiamen retaliated by shelling the nearby village of
Kfar Roumman, while two Israeli helicopter gunships buzzed the
village and dropped flares. No casualties were reported from the
shelling.
   Israel established the security zone, a 6- to 10-mile deep strip
just inside the Lebanese border, when it withdrew the bulk of its
invading army from Lebanon in 1985 after a three-year occupation.
   The zone, patrolled by the South Lebanon Army and Israeli troops,
serves as a buffer zone against cross-border guerrilla forays into
Israel.

<TEXT>
   The Greenpeace ecological group said
Sunday it would put up a human barrier to stop harpooners on a
Japanese whaling fleet from killing more whales in Antarctica.
   ``At the moment we're just following the factory ship,'' said
expedition coordinator Peter Wilkinson, interviewed from Sydney by
radio telephone aboard the Greenpeace ship Gondwana.
   ``We've got some tactics up our sleeve, we plan a peaceful
campaign of interference and harassment,'' he said. ``Basically, we
plan to form a human barrier to deny the harpoonist the site of a
whale.''
   Wilkinson declined to discuss specifics. The Greenpeace ship has
been shadowing the Japanese whaling fleet in Antarctic waters for
the past week.
   He said the Japanese, who claim the kill is necessary to
scientifically determine whaling stocks, killed 10 whales on
Saturday.
   Japan has said it plans to hunt 300 whales this season, despite a
moratorium by the International Whaling Commission.
   ``We are redoubling our efforts to expose this project for what
it is: A simple slaughter of whales for commercial ends,'' Wilkinson
said.
   He said said Greenpeace was told earlier Sunday that crews of the
three Japanese ships would use water hoses and clubs to repel
Greenpeace protesters if they tried to board the whalers.
   Greenpeace, which champions environmental and anti-nuclear
issues, has been in the Antarctic for the past three weeks and has
enough provisions to stay in the region until the end of February,
Wilkinson said.
   He said the group probably will remain with the Japanese for
several more days before heading south to monitor environmental
conditions at the U.S. base at McMurdo Sound, which it claims dumps
too much waste onto the ice.
   Greenpeace is campaigning to have the southern continent declared
a world park. Antarctica is believed to hold rich mineral resources
and Greenpeace fears that such exploitation could ignite military
conflict.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa appealed to
supporters on Sunday to support his talks with the government that
he said could lead to greater economic and political freedom.
   ``I know there are many opponents, both on our side and on the
other one. I need your help because it is not going to be easy,''
Walesa told 3,000 people at St. Brygida's church in Gdansk.
   Solidarity leaders and top government officials on Friday agreed
to meet Feb. 6 for the first session of broad-based talks between
the authorities and opposition that will decide the future of the
banned union.
   Solidarity leaders have fought to regain the union's legal status
ever since parliament banned it in late 1982 following the December
1981 martial law crackdown.
   ``The whole evil and present dramatic situation had its source in
monopoly, so monopoly will have to be replaced with pluralism,''
Walesa said.
   The word pluralism is used in Poland to refer to greater
political and economic freedom and monopoly refers to the communist
party's control over economic and political activities.
   At a news conference on Saturday, Solidarity adviser Bronislaw
Geremek said that both the government and Solidarity agreed that
reform was necessary to combat Poland's deteriorating economy.
   The Solidarity leader said that the union had no intention of
trying to assume political power.

   Smoke drifted through the downtown
area Sunday as firefighters doused hot spots from a blaze that
roared through a two-story commercial building, destroying five
stores.
   The blaze started Saturday night and spread quickly through the
building's empty second floor and then into the stores below and
another nearby, officials said.
   One firefighter suffered a back injury and the owner of a jewelry
store in the building complained of chest pains when she saw the
fire and was hospitalized.
   An investigation into the cause of the blaze was to begin Monday,
after hot spots in the brick, wood and metal ruin cooled.
   ``There's so much rubble, we'll have to get each hot spot one at
a time,'' said Capt. Joel Moore of the Jacksonville Fire Department.
``With the damage as extensive as it is, it will be difficult to
determine the origin and cause of the fire.''
   The largest business destroyed was the flagship of the 26-store
J.B. White department store chain, which has occupied the
63-year-old building since 1951. Owner John B. White estimated the
store's losses at $250,000 to $300,000. White said he was unsure
whether he would rebuild the store, which was founded by his father
in this town of 13,000 about 90 miles southeast of Dallas.
   Four other retailers, including the jewelry store and two
clothing stores within the building and a tobacco shop next door,
also were destroyed.
   Estimates of losses suffered by the other businesses were not
immediately available.

   The right-wing extremist Republican party won its
first seats in the West Berlin legislature Sunday night in a
dramatic and unexpected election success.
   The election also was a major setback for West Berlin's governing
Christian Democrats, which lost its parliamentary majority and plans
to form a coalition with the left-of-center Social Democrats.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in an interview with the ARD
television network that he was ``alarmed'' by the Republicans'
showing in West Berlin.
   The Republican party campaigned on a platform of ridding West
Berlin of foreigners, who make up about 10 percent of the city's 2
million people.
   While public opinion often is directed against the growing number
of foreigners in West Germany, Sunday's election was the most
dramatic example in recent years of a major election success for a
party with stridently anti-foreigner views.
   The Republicans won 8.5 percent of the vote, capturing 10 of 144
seats in the legislature, according to the ARD television network.
   The Christian Democrats won 36 percent of the vote and 47 seats,
and the Social Democrats won 37 percent of the vote and 48 seats,
ARD said.
   The Christian Democrats lost nearly 10 percent of its voter
support and 22 seats from the last election four years ago.
   About 5,000 people, most of them young, demonstrated in downtown
West Berlin late Sunday night to protest the far-right Republicans.
They carried signs saying ``Never Again Fascism'' and other slogans.
   West Berlin's governing mayor, Christian Democrat Eberhard
Diepgen, said the Republicans' successful bid to enter the
legislature ``should not be allowed to cast the city and its
residents in a false light.''
   Walter Momper, head of Berlin's Social Democrats, said ``it's bad
for the city ... that the Republicans were able to achieve this.''
   Franz Schoenhuber, who was a member of the Nazi SS troops during
World War II, is federal head of the Republican party, formed in
1983. Its West Berlin leader is Bernhard Andres, a city police
officer.
   In the ARD television interview, Diepgen said he will seek
negotiations with the Social Democrats to form a ``grand coalition.''
   ARD said Diepgen's coalition partners, the Free Democrats, lost
all 12 of their seats in the legislature.
   According to the ARD forecasts, the Free Democrats polled 3.6
percent of the vote, less than the 5 percent required for a
legislative seat.
   The left-wing Alternative List party kept its 15 legislative
seats with a 11.5 percent showing in the election, ARD said.
   Just under 80 percent of West Berlin's voters cast ballots,
according to television forecasts, compared with 83.6 percent in
1985.

   An earthquake on Sunday shook the region around Mount
Etna in eastern Sicily, causing minor damage to roads and buildings
but only one injury, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
   Scientists said the epicenter of the quake, which measured 3.3 on
the Richter scale, was was along the Ionian coast about 18 miles
north of Catania and near Mount Etna, the highest active volcano in
Europe.
   ANSA said the only person reported injured during the quake was a
16-year-old boy who suffered contusions from falling plaster.
   The agency said officials closed a portion of the highway between
Catania and Messina because of quake damage, and that several other
roads were cracked.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Every increase of one number signifies a tenfold increase in the
amount of energy released.
   A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans,
and one of 3.5 can cause slight damage.

   Police fired into
stone-throwing crowds angered by the arrest of a slaying suspect in
a mixed-race township, killing one person and injuring at least
four, authorities said Sunday.
   Six people also died in continuing violence between black
factions in Natal province, and a black man was wounded by gunfire
during a clash between white police and black stonethrowers in Cape
province, authorities said.
   Police said the violence in the mixed-race township of
Davidsonville, outside Roodeport northwest of Johannesburg, erupted
Saturday evening after a 14-year-old boy was stabbed.
   Police said officers arrested a mixed-race suspect in the slaying
but said a crowd gathered and set the man free.
   ``Police fired one shotgun round fatally wounding another
(mixed-race) man,'' and recaptured the suspect, a police report
said. But the crowd then threw stones at the police, who fired
several shotgun rounds and tear gas, police said.
   The police report said that as the officers were leaving the
scene, a group of people tried to block their vehicle and police
fired another shotgun round, seriously injuring a mixed-race man.
   Police said two white policemen and a township official were
injured by stones. Authorities released no other details about the
clash.
   Authorities also said three black women and three black men were
found stabbed or shot to death in four townships near
Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Natal province, where fighting
between black political factions has taken more than 1,500 lives in
the past 18 months.
   Police also reported wounding a black man when they fired a
shotgun at a stone-throwing group of blacks in Bongelethu, a black
township near Oudtshoorn in western Cape province. They said a group
of blacks near Marble Hall, north of Pretoria, hurled several
gasoline bombs at a bus, causing extnesive damage.
   Police give no motives and few details in their daily unrest
reports. Under emergency regulations imposed June 12, 1986,
reporting on anti-government protests, political violence, and
police actions is restricted.
   Police said they also found a mine late Saturday night in a
street in Durban. They said a policeman had noticed the mine inside
a plastic bag and attached to a transformer at a police radio
workshop.
   Demolition experts removed it, placed it in the street and
detonated it, shattering windows of nearby apartments occupied by
elderly people and blowing a large hole in the street.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Warren E. Burger, who stepped down as chief
justice of the United States in 1986 and hasn't heard a case since,
stands to receive a $60,000-a-year pay raise because he claimed
status as a ``senior judge'' rather than full retirement.
   Burger is not alone. An additional 305 senior judges also legally
qualify for the active-duty pay raises according to administrative
records obtained by The Associated Press that indicate one in five
do no legal work.
   The title of senior judge, created by Congress in 1919, allows
federal jurists to sharply reduce their caseload while still
qualifying for active-duty salary increases. Federal judges are
appointed for life, though they may choose to resign at any time.
   Most senior judges hear cases, but Burger says he doesn't have
the time. By contrast, since he followed Burger off the bench in
1987, former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell has served on the
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., and next month
will sit on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Florida.
   Burger declined to answer questions about his impending pay
increase and his judicial workload other than to say, ``I'm too busy
to sit.''
   Most senior judges do substantial work and as a group they handle
between 10 percent and 15 percent of all federal cases. ``Across the
nation, the federal judiciary would be a mess without the help of
senior judges,'' says Appeals Court Judge Frank Coffin.
   Receiving active-duty pay raises while accepting no cases may not
seem equitable, but it is not unlawful. Whatever Congress actually
expected of the senior judges, current statutes require nothing in
return for the active-duty salary increases.
   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead, a member of
a House subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary. The
California Republican said Congress may want to study ``establishing
some minimum work to qualify for the raises.''
   Dozens of senior judges apparently accept no cases, the AP has
learned.
   A report compiled by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
provides rare caseload data on senior judges. For the year ending
June 30, 1987, the study showed that 56 of 271 senior judges, or 21
percent, handled no cases. Of the 56, 49 were over 75 years old.
   ``If you did the survey today I don't think things would be much
different,'' said David Cook, a statistician who put together the
report for the administrative office. The report contains coded
numbers instead of the names of judges. Cook said office policy bars
him from releasing information on individual judges or more recent
composite data. There are now a total of 306, including Burger, but
Cook said the patterns found in 1987 are ``not out of date.''
   Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics at New York
University, said, ``As a lawyer and law teacher I would be troubled
if judges were being paid for doing nothing and getting increments
for doing nothing unless Congress made a conscious decision that
even judges in total retirement should get pay raises.''
   Congress did no such thing. Judges who retire by resigning
receive pensions that equal their last year's salary, but not
subsequent increases. If Burger had taken full retirement in
September 1986, his annual pension would be $108,400. Instead, he
received a 1987 increase to $115,000 and next month he stands to
receive a 52 percent boost to $175,000, the salary earmarked for the
sitting chief justice, William Rehnquist.
   Burger, who spent much of his career campaigning for higher
salaries for judges, took senior status even though he knew at the
time he would be working as the full-time chairman of the
celebration of the 200th anniversaries of the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.
   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said the 81-year-old Burger
has not been asked to hear any cases because, she presumed,
Rehnquist is aware of Burger's bicentennial responsibilities, for
which Burger is not paid.
   The largest salary increases in a decade for top federal
officials take effect Feb. 8 unless Congress disapproves.
Comparatively unnoticed in the political controversy over the 50
percent congressional pay raise are increases just as generous, or
nearly so, for the judiciary.
   District judge salaries would rise from $89,500 to $135,000;
appellate judges from $95,000 to $140,000; and Supreme Court
justices from $110,000 to $165,000.
   Professor Gillers said that even beyond the law, there is nothing
in the judicial code of conduct that makes it unethical for a senior
judge to do no work and collect pay raises.
   ``I can't speak to the personal propriety. Every judge has to
make that decision for himself,'' Gillers said, adding, ``If the law
allows them to enjoy senior status without working and they choose
to do so, then they are behaving perfectly ethically. It may be the
statute should be changed.''
   Moorhead, the congressman whose skepticism last year sidetracked
House action on a bill to lower the age at which a judge qualifies
for senior status, said, ``We need to look into this much further.''
   Coffin, a federal appellate judge from Portland, Maine, who plans
to take senior status soon and maintain a substantial caseload, said
the equity of the system is ``a good theoretical question.''
   ``If there were more frequent pay raises for judges I'd be more
bothered,'' Coffin said. The last increase came in 1987, but many
jurists have complained for years that they are woefully underpaid
compared to top attorneys who regularly argue cases before them.
   The judicial pay raises are not limited to the federal court
system's 750 active judges but would go also to senior judges.
Congress created the category 70 years ago to make way for younger
judges while expanding the capacity of the federal courts. Today,
judges who are at least 65 years old and have 15 years on the
federal bench, or those 70 with 10 years experience, face three
options:
   _Keep working; the Constitution makes it a lifetime appointment.
   _Take full retirement by resigning and receive for life the
annual salary earned on their last day on the bench.
   _Take senior status, with salaries that rise along with those of
active judges. These judges can choose the number and type of cases
they handle.
   The advantage of resignation is the opportunity to take other
jobs such as practicing law. The advantage has not lured many. There
are only 13 former judges who chose to retire by resignation
compared to the 306 who took senior status.
   Many observers say senior judges are essential to the federal
court system. In one of the nation's busiest federal courthouses,
the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, senior judges last year
carried 22 percent of the workload.
   ``They're providing an invaluable contribution to the judicial
system,'' said Michael Kunz, that court's clerk.

<HEAD>Crucial Showdown Within Ruling Elite Predicted At Party Meeting</HEAD>

   Communist leaders are bitterly
divided over how to end the nation's worst postwar crisis as they
prepare for a historic meeting of the policy-making Central
Committee, state-run media said Sunday.
   The meeting on Monday is expected to generate a showdown between
rival factions and may result in sweeping personnel changes that
will indicate whether the country will institute economic and
democratic reform.
   Sources close to the nine-member federal presidency, which also
heads the armed forces, told The Associated Press that the
presidency has warned emergency measures would be imposed nationwide
if a compromise within the ruling elite is not reached.
   The state Tanjug news agency said that at the ``historic''
meeting the leaders ``should concretely state their views about a
series of delicate and open political problems, which have brought
the Communist Party to the brink of its total split and the country
to the most dramatic postwar period.''
   Liberal factions in the ruling League of Communists face a
hard-line coalition led by the president of Serbia's communists,
Slobodan Milosevic.
   The session of the party's Central Committee, which has about 160
members, is to discuss calls for replacement of the country's
Communist Party President Stipe Suvar, who Serbian leaders blame for
the wide split within the party.
   The state-run media indicated that the confrontation is in fact
the clash between two political and economic concepts of
Yugoslavia's future development.
   Suvar, a pragmatist and Milosevic's chief political opponent, is
from Croatia and is also supported by Slovenia, both liberal
republics that favor increased pluralism, more democracy and radical
market-oriented reforms as a solution to the country's woes.
   These include a 250-percent inflation rate, a sharp drop in
living standards and an alarming increase of labor and ethnic unrest.
   Milosevic, who has suppressed all opposition to his authoritarian
style of leadership in Serbia, draws his support from the country's
poorer regions which fear that market-oriented reforms would end
state subsidies for their money-losing industries, leading to
massive layoffs and further public unrest.
   ``The plenum will indicate where the country is going,'' the
influential Croatian daily Vjesnik said.
   In a possible indication of the outcome, the presidency on Jan.
19 named as premier Ante Markovic, who favors market-oriented reform.
   Milosevic's opponents claim that by orchestrating the attacks on
Suvar and other federal officials outside Serbia he is setting the
final stage for a power struggle at the plenum in order to impose
his own brand of ideological dogmatism on all of Yugoslavia.

   In the 5{ years since he became U.S. attorney for
the Southern District of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani has been
called many things: gangbuster, muckraker, publicity hound and
merciless zealot of law and order.
   In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Giuliani, who
announced Jan. 10 that he would leave his post by the end of the
month, assessed his mistakes and triumphs.
   Giuliani, 44, reiterated that he plans to practice law and decide
during the next two months whether to run for mayor.
   Giuliani, a Republican who abandoned the No. 3 spot in the Reagan
Justice Department in 1983 to head the country's most prominent
federal prosecutor's office, gained attention with his aggressive
campaign against organized crime in New York.
   A public official of Italian descent who was willing to use the
word ``Mafia'' at news conferences, Giuliani became a media darling
as he sent the heads of New York crime families and numerous
Sicilian, Hispanic and Asian drug cartels to prison.
   When he turned the same racketeering laws on insider traders and
political grafters, protests arose on Wall Street and in political
clubhouses, complaining Giuliani was too eager to bring criminal
charges and too willing to announce them at news conferences.
   ``I don't take great delight in prosecuting people or sending
them to prison,'' said Giuliani. ``I haven't made criminal anything
that Congress hasn't made criminal.''
   One mistake Giuliani concedes was the hasty insider trading
indictment of Wall Street executives Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton
and Timothy Tabor. The financial community was outraged in February
1987 when Wigton was led away in handcuffs from his office.
   The charges were dropped three months later when a judge refused
to give prosecutors more time to prepare for trial. Giuliani
promised to re-indict the trio but has yet to do so, prompting
critics to charge he had no case or only a weak one and hoped to
pressure the three men into striking a plea bargain.
   ``The case was considerably more complicated _ for all sorts of
reasons _ than we recognized,'' said Giuliani.
   Some of his harshest criticism came for the unsuccessful
prosecution of former Miss America Bess Myerson, 64.
   Many people wondered why Giuliani made a federal case of
Myerson's alleged bribery of a divorce court judge with a
$19,000-a-year city job for the judge's daughter.
   ``That could be asked of all the federal prosecutions that we
bring,'' said Giuliani, ticking off charges brought against scores
of city electrical inspectors and county highway inspectors for
bribes as small as $500.
   His toughest case? ``Wedtech,'' Giuliani answers without
hesitation, because it involved ``people who were close to my
supervisor, the attorney general of the United States.''
   The investigation of the now-defunct Wedtech Corp., a Bronx
defense contractor, led to the racketeering conviction of former
U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and several others.
   Defense lawyers claimed then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III was
just as heavily involved in the scandal. To defuse the so-called
``Meese defense,'' a prosecutor _ with Giuliani's approval _ told
the jury Meese was a ``sleaze'' but said it had no bearing on the
Biaggi trial.
   ``I believe most people on the outside (of the Justice
Department) agreed with the comment,'' said Giuliani, who declined
to give his personal opinion of Meese, who was never charged with
criminal activities.
   ``There's no doubt that it was a justifiable comment based on the
evidence in that case,'' Giuliani said warily.

   Robert LeRoy Knudsen, whose photographs
chronicled nearly three decades of major White House events, has
died at Bethesda Naval Hospital after a heart attack.
   The 61-year-old Knudsen joined the White House photographers'
staff in 1946, being detailed there from the Navy secretary's office
following his graduation from the Naval Photographic School in
Pensacola, Fla.
   Knudsen's photographs include the 1948 and 1952 elections of
Presidents Truman and Eisenhower, the historic 1959 meeting between
Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev, the autopsy of slain
President Kennedy in 1963, President Nixon's 1972 trips to China and
the Soviet Union, Nixon's 1974 farewell in the wake of the
Watergate-scandal and the White House weddings of three first
daughters, Linda and Luci Johnson and Tricia Nixon.
   His pictures had appeared in several prominent magazines,
including Life, Look and The National Geographic. Several of his
Washington scenes were imprinted on the U.S. Postal Service's 1969
beautification stamps.
   The Stormlake, Iowa, native retired in 1974 and had been
operating his own firm since then.
   Knudsen died on Jan. 27 and is survived by his wife, two
daughters, two sons, two sisters and four grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein agreed Sunday to a
U.N. proposal to set up a joint military committee with Persian Gulf
rival Iran, a U.N. envoy said.
   After a four-hour meeting with Saddam, U.N. envoy Jan Eliasson
said the Iraqi president also agreed to lift a ban barring
Iranian-bound civilian flights from flying over Iraq.
   Diplomats said the development, also reported by official Baghdad
Radio, is a significant breakthrough in U.N. efforts to revive
stalled peace talks to end the eight-year gulf war.
   Eliasson told The Associated Press after his negotiations in
Tehran and Baghdad that the agreements were ``the two most concrete
measures that could improve the atmosphere'' but added: ``I don't
want to speak about breakthroughs.''
   Still, he said he was hopeful of new high-level talks.
   Diplomats in the Iraqi capital, who requested anonymity, said a
joint military group signaled hopes of a troop withdrawal by both
sides. The group could work with U.N. military observers monitoring
the Aug. 20 cease-fire, they said.
   Iraq's and Iran's failure to agree on a withdrawal, called for
under a July 1987 Security Council resolution, has been a major
sticking point in talks that have dragged on inconclusively for five
months.
   Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador and special envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, arrived in Baghdad Friday
after four days of talks with Iranian leaders. He is due back in New
York on Tuesday.
   The envoy said the mixed military working group would be formed
under U.N. supervision, but he said he was not sure what level of
military commander would serve from each side.
   Eliasson also said new talks were possible.
   ``The secretary-general and I are hopeful of being able to meet
with the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq in New York in the near
future,'' he said.
   He could not specify a date, saying Perez de Cuellar had to
confirm the most appropriate forum for the talks.
   Talks broke down in Geneva on Nov. 11. Iran says it considers
further talks futile unless Iraq halts what it calls delaying
tactics.
   Baghdad Radio reported that Saddam reiterated to Eliasson that
Iraq rejects any Iranian conditions to resuming negotiations, but
Eliasson said no conditions have been set for the proposed talks.
   Iran has said that before it returns to the negotiating table,
Iraq must agree to the complete and immediate implementation of the
Security Council resolution, including withdrawing troops to the
prewar border.
   Baghdad Radio said Saddam agreed to participate in the joint
military committee and to lift the flight ban ``out of Iraq's
keenness for the U.N. envoy's mission to succeed and its readiness
to cooperate with him.''
   Iran charges Iraq is blocking agreement by refusing to withdraw
from 260 square miles of Iranian border territory captured in final
stages of the fighting. Iraq says it will not withdraw until Iran
agrees to surrender its right to search ships in the gulf for
Iraq-bound war materiel.
   The sides also dispute ownership of the Shatt al-Arab waterway,
their prewar southern boundary.

   A bus packed with schoolchildren
toppled into a culvert during a thunderstorm, and news reports said
Sunday that 48 passengers were killed and 75 seriously injured.
   The storm had filled the culvert with water and many victims
drowned before rescuers could reach them, national television
reported.
   Reporters for the official daily Fraternite Matin said they had
been unable to find the driver among the dead or among those
hospitalized.
   The newspaper quoted survivors as saying the bus driver was
traveling too fast for the conditions. One survivor said the bus
conducter had twice ordered the driver to slow down.
   The television, which showed graphic footage of piles of school
books and dozens of bodies lined up awaiting removal, said the bus
was carrying passengers from the central Plateau district to the
industrial Yopougon area. The bus was shown lying upside down in the
culvert.
   The accident occurred Saturday, and was the fourth transport
accident in the Abidjan area since October. The accidents have
claimed 82 lives.

   Suspected Sinhalese extremists raided
the house of a governing party official in a southern town and
stabbed him to death, officials said Sunday, raising to nine the
death toll in weekend violence.
   P.G. Munasinghe, a 47-year-old town council chairman and member
of the governing United National Party, was killed in his house in
Matale, 90 miles west of the capital, officials said.
   Meanwhile, extremists fatally shot two policemen and a civilian
in an ambush in two other southern towns and militants attacked
three police stations in or near the capital, killing four policemen
and a civilian, police said.
   The killings were blamed on the People's Liberation Front, a
militant Sinhalese group. A military official said the police
station attacks were aimed at frightening voters away from the polls
in next month's parliamentary election.
   ``It is apparently a psychological exercise to drive home the
point the Sinhalese subversives were quite capable of hitting city
police stations at their will,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Ten candidates for the Feb. 15 election already have been killed
by radical groups opposed to the government. Eight have been blamed
on Sinhalese extremists, who oppose the Sihnalese-dominated
government's offer of limited autonomy to the minority Tamil
population that predominates in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   Police say two of the killings were the work of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have rejected the government's peace
overtures made under a peace accord brokered by neighboring India,
the region's military and political giant.
   A government communique said 15 suspected militants were arrested
Sunday during combined army and police searches after the overnight
raids on police stations.
   Officials of the Joint Operations Command, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules, said two soldiers and a civilian,
all Sinhalese, were fatally shot in Akuressa, 72 miles southwest of
Colombo.
   In the attacks on police stations, assailants wearing black
uniforms hurled grenades and homemade bombs before opening fire with
automatic rifles, Senaratne said. He said the gunmen escaped with
weapons but he gave no details.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the island nation's 16 million
people and dominate the government and the military. Tamils, who
account for 18 percent of the population, say they are discriminated
against by the Sinhalese.

<HEAD>Amnesty Urges World Pressure To Halt Iranian Executions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Monday urged the world to
pressure Iran to halt a six-month campaign of political executions
during which more than 1,000 people have died.
   The London-based human rights group made its plea in a statement
submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Commission which is
scheduled to begin its annual meeting Monday in Geneva.
   Amnesty International detailed other abuses it said have
persisted in Iran, including torture, detention without trial and
other ``cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments.
   The group also said it was concerned about a massive anti-drug
crackdown and 21 recorded instances of amputation, usually of the
four fingers of the right hand, which it considered ``cruel, inhuman
or degrading.''
   Tehran radio reported Sunday that 22 more drug smugglers were
hanged publicly in various Iranian cities in the previous three
days, raising the total to 113 in the crackdown launched two weeks
ago.
   ``Amnesty International urges the international community to use
whatever channels are available to persuade the Iranian government
to put an end to the present wave of public executions and to
implement and observe judicial and other procedures to safeguard the
human rights of its citizens,'' the statement said.
   ``Since the end of July 1988, Amnesty International has recorded
over 1,000 names of political prisoners who have reportedly been
executed,'' the statement said. ``And further reports are still
being received.''
   Amnesty International said that while it had expected a prisoner
amnesty for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Islamic
Republic in February, its welcome was ``muted because hundreds, if
not thousands of prisoners will be killed before the amnesty comes
into effect.''
   Revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has pardoned
4,500 convicts imprisoned in the northeastern province of Khorasan
and plans to start releasing them Tuesday when celebrations begin,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency has said.
   Amnesty International said it had appealed to Iran on behalf of
hundreds of prisoners at risk and asked for comment on reported
victims, but received no responses.
   The wave of executions apparently was sparked by an incursion
western Iran from Iraq by the National Liberation Army, a group
backed by the opposition group People's Mujahedeen Organization of
Iran, Amnesty International said.
   Many victims were from that group and other opposition parties
and groups involved in armed opposition to the government, the
statement said.
   Many were imprisoned for years before they were shot to death or
hanged ``and among them there were a large number of prisoners of
conscience and others serving prison terms imposed after unfair
trials for their non-violent political activity,'' the statement
said.
   It said more people connected with opposition groups were being
reported detained without charge, young people were being singled
out for random searches on the street by Revolutionary Guards and
floggings continue to be a widely used.

<HEAD>Amal, Hezbollah Agree To Peace After Assassins Over To Syria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS FARES</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon's warring Shiite Moslem factions
agreed late Sunday to end a 9-month-old power struggle that has
claimed at least 500 lives, officials announced.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told reporters that
the agreement between the Syrian-backed Amal and the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, will be signed Monday.
   ``I will stay on until they sign,'' said Velayati, who had been
scheduled to fly back to Tehran late Sunday.
   ``I hope that Amal and Hezbollah can continue their cooperation.
One of the most important subjects that both sides have agreed upon
is the cease-fire,'' he said outside the ministry.
   The agreement came after both factions handed over to Syria the
assassins of leaders of both groups.
   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military intelligence chief in
Lebanon, told The Associated Press that Hezbollah delivered the men
who assassinated Amal's leader in south Lebanon, Daoud Daoud, in a
south Beirut ambush Sept. 22.
   He said Syrian forces also were given an Amal man accused by
Hezbollah of killing Sheik Ali Krayyem, one of its leaders, in the
Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon soon after Daoud Daoud's slaying.
   He did not name them or say what will happen to them.
   But the mutual surrender of the alleged assassins was apparently
the key to securing the long-elusive treaty after tough bargaining
to end the war between the Shiite rivals in Lebanon.
   More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded since the
hostility between the rival Shiite movements exploded into open
warfare in April.
   The fighting has been halted several times through cease-fires
arranged by Syria and Iran. But the deep-rooted enmity between the
groups, which has divided clans and families, has repeatedly
shattered the truces in bloody clashes.
   The peace accord emerged from the meeting between Velayati,
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and Amal and Hezbollah
leaders.
   Amal leader Nabih Berri and Hezbollah chieftains led by Sheik
Ibrahim Amin were brought in for face-to-face talks after the
foreign ministers hammered out a formula in three rounds of talks
Saturday and Sunday.
   Asked whether the fate of 15 foreign hostages, many of them
widely believed to be held by groups linked to Hezbollah, would be
affected by the peace treaty, Amin noted: ``This matter has no
relation with us, nor with the agreement.''
   Nine Americans are among the captives and the longest held
hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Fighting between Amal and Hezbollah for control of Lebanon's 1
million Shiites, the country's largest sect, has strained relations
between Damascus and Tehran.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, considers that country
its sphere of influence and vital to its regional ambitions.
   Tehran has long sought to establish an Islamic-style Islamic
republic there through Hezbollah. The secular Syrians view
Hezbollah's bid for power as a serious challenge.
   The more secular and nationalist Amal seeks a multi-sect
government in Lebanon, with Moslems sharing power with the
traditionally dominant Christians.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Enjoys Strong Support But Many Question Effect of Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll of 1,000 Moscow residents shows
overwhelming support for Mikhail Gorbachev's economic restructuring,
but when pressed, about half said the changes had no real impact on
their lives.
   The poll also indicated a majority of Moscow residents admit the
Soviet war in Afghanistan was a mistake and that former leader
Leonid Brezhnev was bad for the country, the Daily News said in its
Sunday editions.
   The poll, conducted by the Daily News along with five other news
organizations, shows Gorbachev's economic reforms enjoy a 93 percent
approval rating. But when pressed, 51 percent of those polled said
the reforms have had no real impact on their lives. And 17 percent
said the reforms were having a negative impact, the Daily News
reported.
   The poll also found that many Moscow residents are afraid to
venture out at night and that only 37 percent said they are very
proud to be Soviet citizens.
   The unprecedented poll was conducted in conjunction with WCBS
Radio and WCBS-TV in New York, WCVB-TV in Boston, KRON-TV in San
Francisco and the Detroit Free Press.
   The poll was conducted by the Soviet Institute of Sociology using
questions from the news organizations. The Boston polling firm of
Marttila &amp; Kiley, which conducted the U.S. end of the survey,
monitored the telephone interviews that took place between Dec. 12
and Dec. 21 and compiled the results. The pollsters reported a
margin of sampling error of 3.1 percentage points.
   On international relations, the poll indicated that Moscow
residents are overwhelmingly optimistic about the United States and
the Soviet Union getting along.
   Soviet experts said some of the results may not accurately
reflect attitudes, especially the overwhelming support for Gorbachev.
   ``We have no tradition of voicing public criticism of our
leaders,'' said Vladimier Andreyenkov of the Soviet Institute of
Sociology. ``Gorbachev's popularity is indeed high, but I would take
these figures with some reservations.''
   But the Moscow residents, 65 percent of them, rated former leader
Brezhnev unfavorably. And former dictator Josef Stalin received a 66
percent unfavorable rating.
   Another factor that may have influenced the answers of the Moscow
residents is that they were told at the start of questioning that
the poll was part of a joint U.S.-Soviet venture.

<HEAD>IRA Will Try To Avoid Killing Civilians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army on Sunday said
it would focus its violent attacks on the British army and try to
avoid killing civilians.
   The statement followed criticism by the IRA's legal political
wing, Sinn Fein, during the party's three-day annual conference.
   Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness on Saturday
expressed unhappiness with the killing of civilians in the IRA's
fight against British rule in Northern Ireland.
   At the close of the conference on Sunday, an unidentified man
read a statement from the outlawed guerrilla group's ruling army
council that said: ``We will continue to attack (British) Crown
forces _ but heed Gerry Adams' warning to avoid civilians.''
   The brief statement won loud applause from the 500 conference
delegates.
   In Londonderry, Northern Ireland, on Sunday, McGuinness spoke on
the same subject to a gathering of marchers commemorating the
``Bloody Sunday'' shooting of 1972, when 14 civilians were killed
there by British troops during a Roman Catholic civil rights protest.
   McGuinness said the IRA had made ``an awful lot of mistakes''
involving the deaths of civilians.
   A ``lot of mayhem'' was caused among innocent people, he said,
but the IRA showed integrity and courage in tackling the issue of
civilian killings, he said.
   ``The IRA have stood up and said `Yes it was wrong, yes we will
try to ensure it does not happen again','' he told a crowd of 3,000.
   ``I believe the IRA have made mistakes. They have killed people
by accident but the reality is too many civilians have been killed.''
   Some observers have linked Sinn Fein's unusual rebuke to the
party's determination to do well in elections this year.
   As expected, the conference unanimously agreed to comply with the
new British government order that all candidates in Northern Ireland
elections sign an anti-violence oath.
   The party national executive had urged delegates not to allow
``any British-inspired oath or pledge to prevent Sinn Fein
representing its electorate in local councils.''
   Sinn Fein's leadership viewed the British move as an effort to
remove the party from the political process in Northern Ireland.
   A new law expected to be in effect in time for local elections in
May will require candidates to sign a declaration that if elected
they would not express support for terrorism. Any breach is to be
punishable by a five-year ban from office.
   Skeptics have said Sinn Fein candidates would likely take the
oath but ignore it.

   Entertainers Liza Minelli, Pia Zadora, Ben
Vereen, Irene Cara and Connie Stevens collaborated Sunday in the
making of a record and TV special to raise money for earthquake
victims in Soviet Armenia.
   ``We can do what we usually do in life to raise money,'' Miss
Minelli said before stepping into a recording studio at Paramount
Pictures Sunday afternoon. ``We can't do anything politically. When
I saw the disaster in Armenia I thought I was going to die.''
   The song ``For You, Armenia,'' was written by Charles Aznavour
and George Garvarentz and translated to English by Paul Williams.
Aznavour recorded the song for release in France with proceeds going
to quake aid.
   Reminiscent of the fund-raising effort of songs such as ``We Are
The World,'' most of the profit from ``For You, Armenia,'' will be
given to the Armenian Relief Society for direct donation to quake
victims.
   ``I've known Charles practically my whole life,'' Miss Minelli
said of Aznavour. ``When his people got into trouble, he mobilized.
I went to him and asked, `What can I do?' And he said, `Lift your
voice.'''
   Miss Minelli and such musicians as Ray Parker Jr., Steve
Lawrence, Juice Newton, members of the Doobie Brothers and Toto and
actor-singer David Soul headed a list of nearly 100 performers who
stood on platforms like a choir group as they rehearsed the song.
   The song will benefit victims who suffered from the devastation
that hit the Soviet-Turkish border last Dec. 7. The temblor measured
6.9 on the Richter scale of ground motion, killed about 25,000
people and left 500,000 homeless.
   ``The world is by your side. We know you will survive. For you
Armenia we've opened up our arms. You've opened up our hearts,'' the
song states.
   ``What this shows is that the entertainment business, in general,
can have a bigger effect on the world than once thought,'' said Miss
Newton. ``This is a real positive effect. It's a real plus to show
you care. Those people really need our help.''
   Actress Adrienne Barbeau, whose mother is Armenian, said she
jumped at the chance to participate.
   ``The only involvement I've been able to have so far is to donate
money and be here for this,'' she said.
   ``I see people reaching out with their hearts, minds and souls,''
said radio personality Casey Kasem. ``They want to repair the
world.''
   Aznavour said he wants the quake orphans to be well taken care of.
   ``I don't want to see the orphans go to other states because
they're the last of the culture,'' he said.
   Michael Masser and Joel Cohen are producing the record and Peter
Bogdonovich and Laszlo Kovacs will film the one-hour documentary and
music video. It was not immediately known which record company would
release the single.
   When asked how much money the record would raise Cohen said,
``Only God can determine that.''

   Mid-sized cities low in crime and smog but high
in affordable housing and good jobs are becoming the new ``hot
cities'' among Americans, the latest edition of Newsweek says.
   More Americans will migrate to these so-called ``second tier''
cities that offer the best of big-city living, said authorities
quoted in the news magazine's Feb. 6 edition.
   Newsweek listed 10 cities meeting that description: Providence,
R.I.; Portland, Ore; Sacramento, Calif.; St. Paul, Minn.;
Albuquerque, N.M.; Birmingham, Ala.; Fort Worth, Texas; Charlotte,
N.C.; Columbus, Ohio; and Orlando, Fla.
   ``Given the choice, most people don't want to live in the Los
Angeleses, Chicagos and New Yorks,'' urbanologist Harvey Jacobs, of
the University of Wisconsin, told the magazine.
   The cities on the list were once considered ``ugly duckings'' but
their relative lack of crime and other urban headaches combined with
a growing cultural awareness make them good places to live, the
magazine said.
   St. Paul, long overshawdowed by its twin city, Minneapolis, is
now considered the ``better half'' of the two cities, the story
said. Fort Worth, also in the shadow of Dallas, has survived the oil
bust better than Dallas, the magazine said.

<HEAD>Spraggett, Yusupov Draw Sixth Game; Match Goes Into Overtime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUEBEC CITY, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sixth game of the World Chess
Championship Candidates' quarterfinal between Kevin Spraggett of
Canada and Artur Yusupov of the Soviet Union was drawn on Sunday,
forcing the match into overtime.
   With the final score tied 3-3, a ``mini-match'' of two games will
be played. Yusupov will play with the advantage of white in the
first game on Tuesday.
   If a tie persists, a series of sudden-death tie-breakers played
at increasingly high speeds will be employed to break the deadlock.
   In Sunday's game, Spraggett, playing white, exchanged queens to
reach an endgame where he hoped to exploit Yusupov's weakened pawn
formation. But the Soviet grandmaster neutralized his opponent's
strategy with a pawn break on the 22nd move.
   In the final position, Yusupov has one pawn more, but its path is
blocked and neither side can make any progress.
   The winner of the Candidates, a series of knockout matches, will
challenge world champion Garri Kasparov for his title in 1990.
   In the seventh game, experts said the onus will be on Yusupov, a
28-year-old Muscovite who began the contest as clear favorite, to
achieve a decisive breakthrough.
   Spraggett, 34, from Montreal, may be content to avoid risks in
the next games, but go all-out in the sudden-death finish.
   In the previous stage of the competition, Spraggett knocked out
Soviet Grandmaster Andrei Sokolov in a nerve-wracking tie-breaker
where each players' thinking time was limited to 15 minutes for the
entire game.
   ``It's anybody's match now,'' said Canadian chess expert Larry
Bevand. ``Kevin has proved he can meet Yusupov and hold his own.''
   British Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman is already through to the
semifinal of stage.
   The first game in the third quarterfinal, between Anatoly Karpov
of the Soviet Union and Johann Hjartarson of Iceland in Seattle,
Wash., ended in a draw Saturday.
   The fourth duel, between Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman and Lajos
Portisch of Hungary, is scheduled to open in Antwerp, Belgium, on
Wednesday.
   A win scores one point and a draw a half point.

<HEAD>Castro's Visit To Venezuela This Week Stirs Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some prominent leaders on Sunday called
Cuban President Fidel Castro a ``Caribbean Devil'' and a human
rights offender who should not have been invited to pay a visit this
week, his first in 30 years.
   Castro, along with over two dozen chiefs of state and high
government officials, including Vice President Dan Quayle, has
accepted an invitation to attend the inauguration Thursday of Social
Democratic President Carlos Andres Perez.
   Perez has said he will try to improve relations with Cuba but has
repeatedly said that ideological discrepancies between democratic
Venezuela and Marxist Cuba will remain insurmountable.
   ``Castro has been a factor of perturbation in the Caribbean,''
said Manuel Penalver, a leader of the governing Democratic Action
party. ``Venezuela does not win anything (with his visit). It rather
loses international credibility.''
   Penalver, who until last year was the party's secretary general
and represents the party's right wing, called Castro ``The Caribbean
Devil,'' saying the Cuban leader tried to impose a Marxist regime in
Venezuela.
   Castro visited Venezuela in 1959, shortly after toppling dictator
Fulgencio Batista. Castro received a warm welcome, but the open
support he later granted to Marxist guerrillas that plagued
Venezuela in the early 60s led Venezuela to break relations with
Havana.
   ``I don't quite understand the reasons for inviting Castro to the
ceremonies. I must express my personal dissatisfaction for inviting
a dictator who in 30 years has done nothing but trample Cubans'
human rights,'' said Monsignor Jorge Urosa Sabino, the Caracas
auxiliary bishop during a homily Saturday at a mass commemorating
136 years of the birth of Cuban hero Jose Marti.
   As president for the first time between 1974 and 1979, Perez
restored relations with Cuba, but diplomatic normalcy between both
countries did not last long.
   In 1980 they were on the brink of a total rupture again after a
Venezuelan military court acquitted anti-Castro leaders suspected of
blowing up a Cubana de Aviacion jetliner in 1976.
   Rightist deputy Vladimir Gessen, of the Democratic New Generation
party, also protested Castro's visit.
   ``The Caribbean dictator may have had some achievements. But also
Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and Pinochet had some and it is not a
justification for their crimes,'' he said in a full-page
advertisement in the newspaper El Nacional on Sunday.

<HEAD>Jury In Steinberg Child-Murder Trial Finishes Seventh Day</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with jury retired for the night, second
note asking for clarification on lesser charges. Adds maximum terms for
each charge.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury deciding the fate of Joel Steinberg,
accused of murdering his illegally adopted daughter, finished its
seventh day of deliberations Sunday after asking for a clarification
on a lesser charge.
   Deliberations resumed about 11:15 a.m. after some jurors attended
church services. The jury retired Sunday night without reaching a
verdict and planned to reconvene Monday morning.
   Steinberg, 47, is accused of fatally beating Lisa Steinberg, the
6-year-old girl he and his live-in companion, Hedda Nussbaum, had
illegally obtained at birth.
   Just after 5 p.m. Sunday, the jury sent out its second note
asking for legal definitions relating to lesser charges. The jury
asked for a clarification of the definition of ``intent'' and
``serious physical injury,'' which are elements of the lesser charge
of manslaughter.
   The note also asked, ``If there was no apparent intention to
cause injury, but the acts resulted in serious physical injury
nonetheless, would that be grounds to conclude intent as spelled out
by law?''
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax instructed jurors
several times not to consider manslaughter unless they unanimously
acquitted Steinberg of the most serious charge, second-degree murder.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, faces four charges: second-degree
murder, first-degree manslaughter, second-degree manslaughter, and
criminally negligent homicide.
   A similar note from the jurors Saturday prompted one of
Steinberg's lawyers to suggest the jurors had acquitted his client
of murder and moved on to the second count.
   ``I can't say it's a strong indication _ it does not mean they've
acquitted him of murder two, but it's an indication,'' said Ira
London.
   The murder charge carries a maximum penalty of 25 years to life
in prison. Other maximum penalties are: First-degree manslaughter,
up to 15 years; second-degree manslaughter, up to 15 years;
criminally negligent homicide, up to 4 years.

   After months of anger and uncertainty, a
strike deadline looms at midnight Tuesday for 1,700 Appalachian coal
miners who have been on the job for Pittston Coal Group Inc. with no
contract.
   In recent days, Pittston and the United Mine Workers adopted a
conciliatory tone for the first time in the yearlong dispute, even
though neither side would predict that continuing talks might avert
a walkout in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   The UMW issued statements last week that mentioned areas of
agreement. Pittston President Michael Odom said over the weekend
that the two sides were in ``substantial agreement'' on much of new
contract, although a half-dozen key sticking points remained.
   They met again Sunday in Washington to continue going over fine
points of a contract offer the union made Tuesday, in response to a
company offer made Nov. 9, company and union officials said.
   Pittston and the union planned another bargaining session Monday,
Odom said Sunday night.
   On Saturday, the governors of the three states said they had
asked UMW President Richard Trumka and the chairman of Pittston's
parent company, The Pittston Co., Paul Douglas, to try and avert a
strike, possibly by taking 30 to 60 days for each side to cool off.
   ``We're in total agreement with the governors that a strike is
senseless to their constituents and communities and the business
climate of the coal community,'' Odom said from his Abingdon home.
   Noting that the governors had asked the union for an immediate
reply, Odom said, ``I hoped they would have responded sooner.''
   UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said Saturday that before any decision
on putting off a strike would be made, Trumka would have to confer
with international union officers and elected district and local
officials.
   ``As we speak, there's a lot of momentum and people are preparing
for a strike,'' Corcoran said from his home in Silver Spring, Md.
``People are getting assignments and meetings are being set up.''
   Corcoran said top union officials will probably meet Monday to
discuss the governors' request.
   The labor dispute began last winter, when the companies of the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association agreed on a new contract with
miners for the second time in a row with no strike. Pittston had
dropped out of the the industry association, saying its business was
different from other major eastern producers and it required a
different type of contract.
   ``This company mines thin, deep metallurgical coal seams that
compete predominantly in the export market,'' Odom said. ``That
market is not protected by long-term price contracts. Every year,
you have to compete with the world competition.''
   Other major eastern coal producers enjoy long-term contracts with
domestic utilities, he said.
   Miners agreed to stay on the job with no contract after last Feb.
1 but each side repeatedly accused the other of hindering progress
in the contract talks.
   The UMW took miners off the job for a four-day ``memorial
period'' and then a six-day ``memorial period.''
   Pittston cut off health benefits to some 1,500 retirees, widows
and disabled miners, saying the benefits would have to be addressed
in a new contract. Several scattered wildcat strikes in Virginia and
West Virginia were believed spurred by retirees who set up picket
lines, company and union officials said.
   Pittston has vowed to operate through a strike and has advertised
for permanent replacement miners.
   New York analysts who follow the coal industry said last week
that the company will be able to operate through a strike, although
it might take several months to get up to full capacity.
   But the UMW has two unfair labor practices complaints pending
with the National Labor Relations Board and if the NLRB rules in
favor of the union, UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts said, miners
can strike in protest without fear of being permanently replaced.

   About 200 people demonstrated Sunday outside a
federal detention center to protest the treatment of Haitian
immigrants held there.
   Inside the gates of the Immigration Service's Krome Avenue
Detention Center several dozen federal officers stood in closed
ranks, wearing shields, helmets, clubs and body armor.
   ``We come for peace, and they're ready for war,'' said Ray
Fauntroy, president of Dade County chapter of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.
   The protesters were primarily Haitians. They carried placards
saying: ``Fight Racism. Justice For Black People'' and ``One black
is hurt, all are hurt.''
   The Haitians say people from their homeland are more likely to be
held for deportation than are white immigrants.
   Immigration officials have maintained that most Haitians entering
the United States are not eligible for asylum because they are
seeking economic refuge and not fleeing political persecution.
   The detention center, which is housing about 300 Haitians, was
placed under a modified lockdown _ severely restricting the movement
of detainees _ in preparation for the demonstration, officials said.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service district director Perry
Rivkind acknowledged earlier this month that the detention center
became seriously overcrowded with the arrival of 94 Haitians picked
up after their homemade sailboat ran aground in the Florida Keys.
   ``The more people at Krome, the longer they have to wait in line
for food and other things, the opportunity for protests and tension
grows,'' Rivkind said.
   Betty Ferguson, one of the speakers at the rally, mentioned the
riot-ready officers behind the fence, some of whom were armed.
   ``When they are ready to shoot us down like dogs, then that means
they know we are right,'' she said. ``We are only asking equal
treatment for Haitians.
   ``If they treat us like this and we're in the outside, how do you
think they're treating them on the inside?'' she asked.
   The demonstration was sponsored by the Haitian organization
Veye-Yo. Its members distributed leaflets listing the group's aims:
equal treatment for black refugees, freedom for the Haitians at
Krome and other installations around the nation, and no support for
any Haitian government linked to ousted dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
   Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, director of the Haitian Refugee Center,
was among those in the crowd. ``We want equal treatment,'' he said.
``The Nicaraguans don't come here (to Krome). The Cubans don't stay
too long.''

   A 16-year-old boy surrendered to police Sunday
in connection with last week's shooting of four youngsters at a
Washington high school.
   The boy is the second person arrested in the shootings at Woodrow
Wilson High School. He surrendered shortly before noon Sunday and
was charged with assault with intent to kill, officials said.
   He is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in District of Columbia
Superior Court, police said. They would not reveal the youth's
identity, but said the teen-ager may be tried as an adult.
   The shootings occurred as students were leaving school Thursday.
A single assailant opened fire with an automatic weapon into a crowd
of students, wounding four, and then fled with at least one
accomplice in a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   The wounded students were treated and released from area
hospitals.
   Police said they were investigating motives for the shootings,
but that the incident apparently was triggered by an argument
earlier in the day in the school cafeteria over a girl. They said
there were no indications that drugs were involved.
   Earlier, police arrested Rodney Reardon, 18, of Washington and
charged him with four counts of assault with intent to kill. Neither
he nor the 16-year-old arrested in the case attended Wilson High,
officials said.

<HEAD>Minister Back in Pulpit Three Years After Leaving in Disgrace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fundamentalist minister who left his
pulpit three years ago in disgrace after confessing to adultery
began preaching again Sunday, with forgiveness one of his themes.
   ``I have learned a lot of lessons. It's been a tough three
years,'' The Rev. Herman ``Buddy'' Frankland told about 50 people
gathered at the service held in a room rented at the Bangor Ramada
Inn. ``But I'm back because of your letters. ... My sins are under
the blood of Jesus Christ.''
   Frankland has stayed almost entirely out of the spotlight since
late 1985, when he left the Bangor Baptist Church after announcing
he had committed adultery.
   After he stepped down, a split occurred within the congregation,
prompting a fellow fundamentalist, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, to step
in as acting pastor to help reunite the church in 1986.
   In his services Sunday, Frankland talked about God's willingness
to forgive all sinners, even Ted Bundy, the serial killer who was
put to death in the electric chair last week.
   Frankland, no longer affiliated with Bangor Baptist Church, said
Sunday he was looking for a place he could rent for services in a
new church he called Messiah Temple.
   Asked after the sermon what prompted his return, Frankland said
he had received an inspiring letter from a former parishioner and
had felt guilty for having left his congregation.
   He acknowledged some people say he does not belong in Bangor but
he said, ``A shepherd should not leave his flock. I don't care what
people say.''
   Frankland founded the Bangor Baptist Church in 1966 and built it
into one of the largest in New England, with a reported membership
of 3,000 and with its own school and radio station.

   Nineteen abortion protesters
arrested at a clinic spent Sunday in jail after refusing to give
authorities their names, police said.
   The protesters were among 25 arrested Saturday at the Medical
Care Center at Woodbridge and charged with trespassing and
obstruction, Woodbridge police said.
   Eight of the demonstrators chained themselves together
neck-to-leg in the clinic's waiting room, while 17 others lay or sat
on the floor. At least 20 other protesters picketed and chanted
outside.
   It took police 12 hours to free all eight people from the
reinforced steel shackles and bars. Special equipment was brought in
from the New York City Police Department to grind through the metal.
   Ten women and 12 men spent Saturday night at the jail, said Sgt.
Charles Luizza. Three people gave police their names and addresses
and were released Sunday, he said.
   Bail initially was set at $500, but Municipal Judge Joseph
Dambach waived the bond if the protesters gave their names, Luizza
said.
   Last summer, hundreds of participants in an abortion protest
organized by a group called Operation Rescue overcrowded jails in
Atlanta by similarly refusing to give their names.

   A Louisiana stripper had a six-month sexual
relationship with evangelist Jimmy Swaggart at the same time he
allegedly was involved with a prostitute, a men's magazine reported.
   Penthouse magazine, in its March issue, said Swaggart sought out
Catherine Mary Kampen, a homemaker and performer of striptease
telegrams, promising to help her financially while demanding she
perform sexual acts for him.
   Swaggart's attorneys told the magazine Kampen's allegations were
untrue and that she fabricated the account. Phillip A. Wittmann, an
attorney for Swaggart, said the evangelist will sue Penthouse.
   The magazine said Swaggart approached Kampen at a roadside
telephone in July 1987 and said he could help her with her marriage
and personal life.
   Kampen told the magazine that she and Swaggart never had sexual
intercourse during the course of their relationship.
   She told Penthouse she wondered if Swaggart wanted to have
intercourse with her, so she asked him.
   ``And he said, `Oh sure, but that would be cheating. What we're
doing here is just playing _ it's fun and games, it's not cheating.
You understand that, don't you,''' Kampen quoted Swaggart as saying.
   Over the course of their relationship she said Swaggart:
   _Made her perform explicit sex acts while he watched, an
allegation also made about him by a prostitute, Debra Murphree, whom
Swaggart allegedly was seeing at the same time.
   _Requested sex with Kampen's 13-year-old daughter, but Kampen
refused.
   Swaggart confessed on the air in February 1988 that he had
``sinned.''
   Kampen said in the Penthouse article she thought he was talking
about her, but Murphree said he was referring to her. Swaggart's
alleged liaison with Murphree was uncovered by a rival evangelist.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God in April 1988
because he disobeyed the Pentecostal denomination's order that he
not preach for a year and returned to the pulpit three months later.

   A Cuban official has disclosed that 270,000 Soviet
and Cuban troops were ready to go to war with the United States
during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and that 100,000 casualties
were expected, former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara said
Sunday.
   A Soviet general confirmed for the first time that one-third of
his country's nuclear warheads designed to strike the United States
were on Cuba at the time. However, he and another Soviet official
said the warheads had not been mounted on missile launchers and were
not ready for firing.
   Also, Cuban leader Fidel Castro urged Moscow to launch a nuclear
attack on the United States, ABC News reported.
   The revelations came during a review of the Cuban missile crisis
at a conference during the weekend at a trade union center in
southwest Moscow.
   Pierre Salinger, Kennedy's former press secretary, a conference
participant and now an ABC correspondent, on Sunday quoted a top
Soviet source as saying in a private conversation that on Oct. 27,
1962, Castro urged Khrushchev to immediately fire the missiles at
the United States to head off an invasion.
   The New York Times had a similiar report on Monday, and quoted
unnamed Americans as saying the report originated with Sergei
Khruschev, son of the former Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev. It
said Sergei Khruschev subsequently denied making the comment.
   The report that Castro had urged the use of nuclear weapons also
was denied by Aleksandr I. Alekseyev, Soviet ambassador to Cuba in
1962.
   Soviets and Americans have met before to discuss the Soviet
deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba and the U.S. response: a
blockade of the island and a demand for the rockets' removal.
   But this was the first joint meeting with Cuban officials who
guided their country through the crisis. Nikita Khrushchev
eventually withdrew the missiles in exchange for President Kennedy's
pledge not to invade Cuba.
   At a news conference wrapping up the conference Sunday, McNamara
said the figures on Cuba's war readiness and casualty estimate were
provided by Jorge Risquet, a member of Cuba's ruling Politburo.
   ``They say they had armed 270,000 men. They were determined to
fight to the death of every man, and they believed there would be
100,000 Cuban and Soviet casualties,'' McNamara told reporters.
   It was not clear whether the 100,000 casualty estimate included
deaths and injuries and whether it referred to losses among soldiers
and civilians.
   Other American officials said privately the Cubans had said the
casualty count could have reached 800,000. Cuba's population at the
time was 8 million.
   McNamara said that of the troops, 40,000 were Soviet, four times
higher than U.S. intelligence estimates at the time.
   Risquet cited the figures to show his country seriously believed
that a U.S. invasion of his island was imminent. McNamara said no
such invasion was ever contemplated, but speaking of the Cubans, he
added: ``If I had been in their shoes, I would have believed the
same thing.''
   American officials have said they were never sure whether any
Soviet nuclear warheads had actually reached Cuba but that they
assumed they had.
   Col. Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov, director of the Defense
Ministry's Institute of Military History, said that at the time of
the crisis, 20 Soviet nuclear warheads were on Cuba. Another 20
warheads were headed to the island aboard a Soviet ship that was
caught in the U.S. naval blockade, he said.
   Volkogonov said he got the figures from military archives.
   He made the remarks in a closed session of the conference
Saturday, and they were reported to The Associated Press on Sunday
by Raymond Garthoff, a State Department official at the time of the
crisis.
   Garthoff, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said Volkogonov reported 20 nuclear missiles were on
Soviet territory targeted at the United States.
   The total stockpile of Soviet nuclear warheads designed to fire
on the United States at that time was 60, Garthoff quoted Volkogonov
as saying.
   Soviet officials had previously been evasive about whether
nuclear warheads had actually reached Cuba, according to Garthoff.
   In his memoirs, however, Khrushchev implied that at the time of
the crisis, the Soviets were ready to deliver a nuclear strike from
Cuba.
   At Sunday's news conference, the Soviet ambassador to Washington
during the crisis, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, said he didn't know at the
time that Soviet warheads were already on Cuba.
   Volkogonov said the warheads were not ready for firing, and
Viktor G. Komplektov, a deputy Soviet foreign minister, said their
presence on Cuba did not mean they would be put on launchers in
preparation for a nuclear strike.
   ``At no time, not before, not during the beginning of the crisis,
or in the most acute moments of the crisis, neither from the Soviet
command there in Cuba nor in Moscow was there, or could there have
been an order to mount nuclear warheads on the missiles,''
Komplektov told reporters. He said ``not one'' of the missiles was
ready and targeted at the United States.

<TEXT>
   Rescuers found no trace of a missing crab
fishing boat with six people aboard after searching the stormy Gulf
of Alaska, the Coast Guard said late Sunday.
   But the crew of a Japanese freighter was reported safe, officials
said.
   The crew of the 98-foot crabber Vestfjord, based in Seattle,
reported that its ship was sinking under the weight of accumulating
ice.
   The Vestfjord had been on a voyage from Seattle to Dutch Harbor
when it ran into 40-foot seas; wind blowing to 60 knots, or about 70
mph; and blowing snow, the Coast Guard said.
   Search aircraft went out in the dark early Sunday but could not
find the vessel because of the severe weather, the Coast Guard said.
   While search aircraft returned to their bases at nightfall, the
cutters Sedge and Morgenthau were to continue looking for the vessel
in the area, 30 miles south of the Trinity Islands. The Trinity
Islands are just south of Kodiak Island.
   Those aboard the missing boat were identified as the vessel's
skipper, Dic LaGary of Seattle; Kevin Melnick, 27, of Seattle;
William Hodgins, 33, of Anchorage; Richard Kristovish, 37, of
Seattle; Doug Harding, 35, of Seattle, and passenger Danny McDonald
of Seattle.
   The missing vessel was equipped with two life rafts, one of which
was equipped with an emergency locator beacon, the Coast Guard said.
No emergency beacon signals were picked up Sunday, the Coast Guard
said.
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard called off its search for the crew
members of a Japanese cargo vessel when it was learned they still
were aboard their vessel.
   The 850-foot Port Star had called for help and was found by a
Navy aircraft. While the ship had lost much of its cargo in the
stormy seas, it still was afloat and heading for Japan, the Coast
Guard said.
   It had been believed that the crew of 20 had abandoned the vessel
some 300 miles southwest of Attu in the Aleutian Islands.
   The Port Star, owned by Nipponkai Steamship Co. of Tokyo, was
transporting logs.

<HEAD>Boeing Announces Revised Delivery Schedule For 747s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co., which has been troubled by delays
in delivering its new 747-400 jumbo jet, plans to produce 57 747
jetliners in 1989, most of them in the second half of the year.
   The number was about what aerospace industry analysts had
predicted, even before Boeing was forced to rework its delivery
schedule.
   Boeing has said that problems with wiring and parts availability,
delays in certification, and an overly ambitious development and
production plan resulted in the delivery schedule being pushed back
three times in four months.
   The first model-400 was delivered Thursday to Northwest Airlines,
a month behind schedule.
   ``Although we regret having to revise delivery schedules, it is
most important to meet our traditional standards of quality and our
customers' high expectations for Boeing airplanes,'' Boeing
Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton said Friday in a news
release.
   Company spokesman David Jimenez said the 57 projected deliveries
include all current models of 747s, but that the rescheduling
primarily involves the model-400, which will make up a majority of
the new planes.
   ``Delivery was to start in 1988 and go into 1989, with the
concentration of deliveries in the first half of the year,'' Jimenez
said. ``Now the concentration will be in the last half of 1989 and
extend to early 1990.
   ``A good part will take place at the end of the year, but we're
not going into specifics.''
   The new 747-400, the world's largest commercial jet, is capable
of carrying 412 passengers 8,400 miles nonstop, and up to 624
passengers on short-range flights. The plane has been extensively
redisigned, with a computerized cockpit that uses video display
screens to replace more than 600 lights, gauges and switches. The
plane can be flown by a crew of two, instead of the three needed on
earlier 747s.
   Boeing currently is producing about four 747s a month and plans
to increase production to about five per month by mid-1989. It had
hoped to deliver 31 747s in 1988, but actually delivered 24.
   In briefings with reporters last week, Phil Condit, Commercial
Airplanes executive vice president for engineering and production
declined to say what, if any, penalties Boeing would have to pay for
being late with the new 747s, which sell for approximately $125
million each.
   Boeing announced in October that it would be about one month late
with the first 20 747-400s. In December, deliveries were pushed back
further because of delays in getting Federal Aviation Administration
certification. Earlier this month, Boeing said it was once again
reviewing its delivery schedule.
   Bill Whitlow, an analyst with Dain Bosworth Co. in Seattle, said
the announcement was with the production range orignally expected.
   ``They're saying they're quite confident they'll be back on track
at some point during the year, and in terms of what the stock market
sees, it's a non-event because they had been projecting between 55
and 65 planes for the year,'' he said.
   He said that while some of the deliveries may slide into 1990,
the net number of planes delivered in 1989 will not change. Boeing
books payment for its aircraft upon delivery.
   Les Childress, an analyst with Harper McLean &amp; Co. in Seattle,
was taking more of a wait-and-see attitude.
   ``Boeing says that it'll deliver 57 planes, but saying that and
doing it are two different things,'' he said. ``They're telling
people they have their problems solved, but I'm not so sure they can
achieve that.''

<HEAD>Audi Repairing Image, Exec Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Audi, the West German luxury automaker, is
trying to repair its dented image with dealers following the furor
over sudden acceleration by some of its cars. But whether the firm
is succeeding is a matter of opinion.
   Audi executives heard from their dealers in a closed meeting
Sunday during the National Automobile Dealers Association
convention, and there was less rancor at this gathering than at last
year's session, said Richard Mugg, vice president in charge of Audi
of America.
   Charges surfaced a few years ago that Audi 5000S automobiles
would accelerate without warning. Consumer groups suggested the
problem was in the car's design, but the company said drivers
stepping on the accelerator instead of the brake were to blame.
   Audi recalled the cars to install a device that prevents the
transmission from being shifted without applying the brake. Since
then, the federal government has received sudden acceleration
complaints from owners of a variety of other cars.
   ``We have a better understanding of each other,'' Mugg said after
meeting with the dealers. ``Last year at this time unintended
acceleration was the major problem and we've put that behind us.''
   But Audi dealer Ray Green of Jacksonville, Ill., disagreed.
   ``They still haven't overcome the stigma of sudden
acceleration,'' he said. If the controversy hadn't happened, Green
added, ``I would predict Audi would be selling more cars today.''
   Audi sales took a beating during 1988, falling 45 percent from
1987 levels. Recently, Audi sales have begun creeping back toward
year-ago figures. The company also has stopped selling the
5000-series cars in the United States.
   ``We had a difficult year phasing out our volume car _ the 5000 _
and replacing it with the 100 and 200,'' Mugg said.
   He added that in the middle of next month, Audi will begin an
image rebuilding campaign with the public and its dealers.
   Meanwhile, Green, who also is a Toyota dealer, said the Japanese
company made a mistake by requiring a separate dealership for its
new Lexus line of luxury cars.
   ``In my opinion, not letting the Toyota dealers have that
franchise is a big mistake,'' he said, adding that the company may
change its mind after Lexus dealerships are in operation for a few
years.
   ``When they see these dealers not making a profit, they will give
the dealers an entry-level vehicle,'' Green predicted.
   The Lexus, scheduled to go on sale this fall, varies in cost from
$20,000 to $40,000. It is aimed at buyers ready for luxury cars but
unwilling to pay more for European imports.

<HEAD>Detroit Newspaper Agency Announces Date For Implementation Of JOA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agency created to administer the proposed joint
operating agreement between the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit
News announced Sunday it would implement the partial merger on Feb.
6.
   The announcement came two days after a three-judge federal
appeals panel in Washington, D.C., upheld U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese's approval of the JOA and unanimously lifted a stay that
had been in effect prohibiting implementation of the agreement.
   The JOA would allow the newspapers to combine advertising,
circulation, production and other business operations to cut costs,
while keeping separate news and editorial departments.
   In light of Friday's decision, the management committee of the
Detroit Newspaper Agency agreed to implement the partial merger
barring further judicial stays prior to Feb. 6, said Alan Lenhoff,
assistant to Free Press Publisher David Lawrence Jr.
   Under the terms of the JOA, the merger of the newspapers'
business operations can begin on that date, the 10th day after the
appeals panel's decision.
   State Sen. John Kelly, head of the Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press, said after Friday's appeals panel ruling that the
opposition group would make a decision on an appeal by Monday.
   The group either can request a hearing before the full 13-member
appellate court or appeal directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Telephone calls to Kelly's home and the home of W. Edward
Wendover, a newspaper publisher who is part of Kelly's group, went
unanswered Sunday afternoon.
   Sunday's announcement was made by William J. Keating, chief
executive of the Detroit Newspaper Agency; Louis A. Weil III, News
president and publisher; and Lawrence.

<HEAD>GM Announces First 26 Saturn Dealers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 26 men picked up pens, signed their
names and on Sunday became the first franchised dealers for General
Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary.
   The 26 dealers, located in large automobile-selling markets in 11
states, are the first of about 90 dealers who will begin selling
Saturn cars in fall 1990, said Donald Hudler, Saturn's vice
president for sales, service and marketing.
   Hudler estimated that each of the dealers invested $2 million to
$4 million to establish a new franchise. The businesses will be
separate from those already owned by the dealers.
   He also said dealers will be required to belong to marketing and
advertising associations. The next group of dealers will be
announced sometime in the late spring or early summer, Hudler said.
   The Saturn car has not been displayed publicly. Its assembly
plant is under construction in Spring Hill, Tenn. Hudler said Sunday
most of the buildings have been completed and the company is
equipping the plant now.
   In the fall of next year, Saturn will begin offering two
four-door models and one two-door car in the subcompact or compact
segment of the market. GM officials have said the car will compete
with imported cars.

   The dollar surged in early trading Monday against
the Japanese yen, while stock prices rose to a new high.
   The dollar opened trading at 129.58 yen, up 0.93 yen from last
Friday's close of 128.65 yen.
   Dealers said the market benefitted from indications U.S. economic
growth remained strong last year. The Commerce Department reported
Friday that U.S. economic growth for 1988 reached 3.8 percent, up
from 3.6 percent in 1987.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 32.94 points to close at a record
31,679.07 points during Saturday's half-day session, added another
64.15 points, or 0.2 percent, to move to 31,743.22 shortly after the
market opened.

<UNK>Texas Eastern Board Rejects Coastal's $2.6 Billion Offer</UNK>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp.'s board of directors
unanimously rejected Sunday a $2.6 billion cash offer from Coastal
Corp., calling it ``clearly inadequate.''
   Coastal announced Jan. 16 it was making a cash tender offer of
$42 per share for all of Texas Eastern's outstanding common shares.
Since then, Texas Eastern's stock has soared, closing Friday at $48
a share.
   The tender offer is set to expire on Feb. 14.
   In a special board of directors meeting Sunday, Texas Eastern's
board was told by financial advisers they should wait for a better
offer.
   Dennis R. Hendrix, Texas Easten's president, said Coastal's offer
``is clearly inadequate.'' He said the board's action are designed
to protect shareholders from ``pressure tactics designed to stampede
them into a decision before they can service a better offer.''
   Hendrix added that the board's decision in no way prevents
Coastal from raising its bid.
   ``If there's only one short-fused bid on the table, shareholders
don't have a choice,'' Hendrix said in a prepared statement, ``they
have an ultimatum. It may be more than what they had, but we don't
believe it is the best they can get.''
   Coastal's president, James R. Paul, said in a statement, ``It's
obvious that after two weeks Texas Eastern still does not have a
better offer than coastal's $42 a share.''
   He said Coastal plans to respond and make further comment after
reviewing documents that Texas Eastern indicated it would file
Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In a court hearing last week in Houston, Texas Eastern officials
said the company might use a ``white knight'' to block the Coastal
bid and had a list of more than 50 possible buyers.
   Coastal officials later suggested that the comment was designed
to inflate stock prices and make their offer appear inadequate.
   Paul has said Coastal has asked Texas Eastern for information
that would justify a higher offer, but said the only response has
been ``rhetoric and a stonewall meeting last Sunday.'' Paul met with
Texas Eastern's board last weekend.
   Analysts have said they doubt that there may be a large number of
serious contenders to take over Texas Eastern, a Houston-based
natural gas company.
   Houston-based Enron Corp., which operates the nation's largest
natural gas transmission system and long had been considered a
possible candidate for a Texas Eastern takeover, will not say
whether it is talking to the company.
   During the court hearing before U.S. District Judge Lynn N.
Hughes, the judge denied a Texas Eastern request to delay a Feb. 7
hearing date in a Coastal lawsuit desinged to prevent Texas Eastern
from using anti-takeover measures.
